The characterization is weak, and the plot, although the\r\nauthor himself thought well of it, mechanical.\r\n\r\nThe value of the story is rather documentary than literary. It\r\ncontains several graphic scenes descriptive of the great Irish\r\nfamine. Trollope observed carefully, and on the whole impartially,\r\nthough his powers of discrimination were not quite fine enough to\r\nmake him an ideal annalist.\r\n\r\nStill, such as they were, he has used them here with no\r\ninconsiderable effect. His desire to be fair has led him to lay\r\nstress in an inverse ratio to his prepossessions, and his Priest is a\r\nbetter man than his parson.\r\n\r\nThe best, indeed the only piece of real characterization in the book\r\nis the delineation of Abe Mollett. This unscrupulous blackmailer\r\nis put before us with real art, with something of the loving\r\npreoccupation of the hunter for his quarry. Trollope loved a rogue,\r\nand in his long portrait gallery there are several really charming\r\nones. He did not, indeed, perceive the aesthetic value of sin--he did\r\nnot perceive the esthetic value of anything,--and his analysis of\r\nhuman nature was not profound enough to reach the conception of sin,\r\ncrime being to him the nadir of downward possibility--but he had a\r\nprofessional, a sort of half Scotland Yard, half master of hounds\r\ninterest in a criminal. "See," he would muse, "how cunningly the\r\ncreature works, now back to his earth, anon stealing an unsuspected\r\nrun across country, the clever rascal;" and his ethical disapproval\r\never, as usual, with English critics of life, in the foreground,\r\nclearly enhanced a primitive predatory instinct not obscurely\r\nakin, a cynic might say, to those dark impulses he holds up to\r\nour reprobation. This self-realization in his fiction is one of\r\nTrollope\'s principal charms. Never was there a more subjective\r\nwriter. Unlike Flaubert, who laid down the canon that the author\r\nshould exist in his work as God in creation, to be, here or there,\r\ndimly divined but never recognized, though everywhere latent,\r\nTrollope was never weary of writing himself large in every man,\r\nwoman, or child he described.\r\n\r\nThe illusion of objectivity which he so successfully achieves is\r\ndue to the fact that his mind was so perfectly contented with its\r\nhereditary and circumstantial conditions, was itself so perfectly\r\nthe mental equivalent of those conditions. Thus the perfection of\r\nhis egotism, tight as a drum, saved him. Had it been a little less\r\ncomplete, he would have faltered and bungled; as it was, he had the\r\nnaive certainty of a child, to whose innocent apprehension the world\r\nand self are one, and who therefore cannot err.\r\n\r\nALGAR THOROLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n         I.

CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE BARONY OF DESMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder whether the novel-reading world--that part of it, at least,\r\nwhich may honour my pages--will be offended if I lay the plot of\r\nthis story in Ireland! That there is a strong feeling against things\r\nIrish it is impossible to deny. Irish servants need not apply; Irish\r\nacquaintances are treated with limited confidence; Irish cousins are\r\nregarded as being decidedly dangerous; and Irish stories are not\r\npopular with the booksellers.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I may say that if I ought to know anything about any\r\nplace, I ought to know something about Ireland; and I do strongly\r\nprotest against the injustice of the above conclusions. Irish cousins\r\nI have none. Irish acquaintances I have by dozens; and Irish friends,\r\nalso, by twos and threes, whom I can love and cherish--almost as\r\nwell, perhaps, as though they had been born in Middlesex. Irish\r\nservants I have had some in my house for years, and never had one\r\nthat was faithless, dishonest, or intemperate. I have travelled all\r\nover Ireland, closely as few other men can have done, and have never\r\nhad my portmanteau robbed or my pocket picked. At hotels I have\r\nseldom locked up my belongings, and my carelessness has never been\r\npunished. I doubt whether as much can be said for English inns.\r\n\r\nIrish novels were once popular enough. But there is a fashion in\r\nnovels, as there is in colours and petticoats; and now I fear they\r\nare drugs in the market. It is hard to say why a good story should\r\nnot have a fair chance of success whatever may be its bent; why it\r\nshould not be reckoned to be good by its own intrinsic merits alone;\r\nbut such is by no means the case. I was waiting once, when I was\r\nyoung at the work, in the back parlour of an eminent publisher,\r\nhoping to see his eminence on a small matter of business touching\r\na three-volumed manuscript which I held in my hand. The eminent\r\npublisher, having probably larger fish to fry, could not see me, but\r\nsent his clerk or foreman to arrange the business.\r\n\r\n"A novel, is it, sir?" said the foreman.\r\n\r\n"Yes," I answered; "a novel."\r\n\r\n"It depends very much on the subject," said the foreman, with\r\na thoughtful and judicious frown--"upon the name, sir, and the\r\nsubject;--daily life, sir; that\'s what suits us; daily English life.\r\nNow your historical novel, sir, is not worth the paper it\'s written\r\non."\r\n\r\nI fear that Irish character is in these days considered almost as\r\nunattractive as historical incident; but, nevertheless, I will make\r\nthe attempt. I am now leaving the Green Isle and my old friends, and\r\nwould fain say a word of them as I do so. If I do not say that word\r\nnow it will never be said.\r\n\r\nThe readability of a story should depend, one would say, on its\r\nintrinsic merit rather than on the site of its adventures. No\r\none will think that Hampshire is better for such a purpose than\r\nCumberland, or Essex than Leicestershire. What abstract objection can\r\nthere then be to the county Cork?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting, and certainly the most beautiful part\r\nof Ireland is that which lies down in the extreme south-west, with\r\nfingers stretching far out into the Atlantic Ocean. This consists of\r\nthe counties Cork and Kerry, or a portion, rather, of those counties.\r\nIt contains Killarney, Glengarriffe, Bantry, and Inchigeela; and\r\nis watered by the Lee, the Blackwater, and the Flesk. I know not\r\nwhere is to be found a land more rich in all that constitutes the\r\nloveliness of scenery.\r\n\r\nWithin this district, but hardly within that portion of it which is\r\nmost attractive to tourists, is situated the house and domain of\r\nCastle Richmond. The river Blackwater rises in the county Kerry, and\r\nrunning from west to east through the northern part of the county\r\nCork, enters the county Waterford beyond Fermoy. In its course it\r\npasses near the little town of Kanturk, and through the town of\r\nMallow: Castle Richmond stands close upon its banks, within the\r\nbarony of Desmond, and in that Kanturk region through which the\r\nMallow and Killarney railway now passes, but which some thirteen\r\nyears since knew nothing of the navvy\'s spade, or even of the\r\nengineer\'s theodolite.\r\n\r\nCastle Richmond was at this period the abode of Sir Thomas\r\nFitzgerald, who resided there, ever and always, with his wife, Lady\r\nFitzgerald, his two daughters, Mary and Emmeline Fitzgerald, and,\r\nas often as purposes of education and pleasure suited, with his son\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald. Neither Sir Thomas nor Sir Thomas\'s house had\r\nabout them any of those interesting picturesque faults which are so\r\ngenerally attributed to Irish landlords and Irish castles. He was\r\nnot out of elbows, nor was he an absentee. Castle Richmond had no\r\nappearance of having been thrown out of its own windows. It was a\r\ngood, substantial, modern family residence, built not more than\r\nthirty years since by the late baronet, with a lawn sloping down\r\nto the river, with kitchen gardens and walls for fruit, with ample\r\nstables, and a clock over the entrance to the stable yard. It stood\r\nin a well-timbered park duly stocked with deer,--and with foxes also,\r\nwhich are agricultural animals much more valuable in an Irish county\r\nthan deer. So that as regards its appearance Castle Richmond might\r\nhave been in Hampshire or Essex; and as regards his property, Sir\r\nThomas Fitzgerald might have been a Leicestershire baronet.\r\n\r\nHere, at Castle Richmond, lived Sir Thomas with his wife and\r\ndaughters; and here, taking the period of our story as being exactly\r\nthirteen years since, his son Herbert was staying also in those hard\r\nwinter months; his Oxford degree having been taken, and his English\r\npursuits admitting of a temporary sojourn in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Thomas Fitzgerald was not the great man of that part of the\r\ncountry--at least, not the greatest man; nor was Lady Fitzgerald by\r\nany means the greatest lady. As this greatest lady, and the greatest\r\nman also, will, with their belongings, be among the most prominent\r\nof our dramatis person\xe6, it may be well that I should not even say a\r\nword of them.\r\n\r\nAll the world must have heard of Desmond Court. It is the largest\r\ninhabited residence known in that part of the world, where rumours\r\nare afloat of how it covers ten acres of ground; how in hewing the\r\nstones for it a whole mountain was cut away; how it should have cost\r\nhundreds of thousands of pounds, only that the money was never paid\r\nby the rapacious, wicked, bloodthirsty old earl who caused it to be\r\nerected;--and how the cement was thickened with human blood. So goes\r\nrumour with the more romantic of the Celtic tale-bearers.\r\n\r\nIt is a huge place--huge, ungainly, and uselessly extensive; built at\r\na time when, at any rate in Ireland, men considered neither beauty,\r\naptitude, nor economy. It is three stories high, and stands round a\r\nquadrangle, in which there are two entrances opposite to each other.\r\nNothing can be well uglier than that great paved court, in which\r\nthere is not a spot of anything green, except where the damp has\r\nproduced an unwholesome growth upon the stones; nothing can well\r\nbe more desolate. And on the outside of the building matters are\r\nnot much better. There are no gardens close up to the house, no\r\nflower-beds in the nooks and corners, no sweet shrubs peeping in at\r\nthe square windows. Gardens there are, but they are away, half a mile\r\noff; and the great hall door opens out upon a flat, bleak park, with\r\nhardly a scrap around it which courtesy can call a lawn.\r\n\r\nHere, at this period of ours, lived Clara, Countess of Desmond, widow\r\nof Patrick, once Earl of Desmond, and father of Patrick, now Earl of\r\nDesmond. These Desmonds had once been mighty men in their country,\r\nruling the people around them as serfs, and ruling them with hot iron\r\nrods. But those days were now long gone, and tradition told little of\r\nthem that was true. How it had truly fared either with the earl, or\r\nwith their serfs, men did not well know; but stories were ever being\r\ntold of walls built with human blood, and of the devil bearing off\r\nupon his shoulder a certain earl who was in any other way quite\r\nunbearable, and depositing some small unburnt portion of his remains\r\nfathoms deep below the soil in an old burying-ground near Kanturk.\r\nAnd there had been a good earl, as is always the case with such\r\nfamilies; but even his virtues, according to tradition, had been of a\r\nuseless namby-pamby sort. He had walked to the shrine of St. Finbar,\r\nup in the little island of the Gougane Barra, with unboiled peas in\r\nhis shoes; had forgiven his tenants five years\' rent all round, and\r\nnever drank wine or washed himself after the death of his lady wife.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the Desmonds were not so potent either for\r\ngood or ill. The late earl had chosen to live in London all his life,\r\nand had sunk down to be the toadying friend, or perhaps I should\r\nmore properly say the bullied flunky, of a sensual, wine-bibbing,\r\ngluttonous--king. Late in life, when he was broken in means and\r\ncharacter, he had married. The lady of his choice had been chosen as\r\nan heiress; but there had been some slip between that cup of fortune\r\nand his lip; and she, proud and beautiful, for such she had been--had\r\nneither relieved nor softened the poverty of her profligate old lord.\r\n\r\nShe was left at his death with two children, of whom the eldest,\r\nLady Clara Desmond, will be the heroine of this story. The youngest,\r\nPatrick, now Earl of Desmond, was two years younger than his sister,\r\nand will make our acquaintance as a lad fresh from Eton.\r\n\r\nIn these days money was not plentiful with the Desmonds. Not but\r\nthat their estates were as wide almost as their renown, and that the\r\nDesmonds were still great people in the country\'s estimation. Desmond\r\nCourt stood in a bleak, unadorned region, almost among the mountains,\r\nhalf way between Kanturk and Maccoom, and the family had some claim\r\nto possession of the land for miles around. The earl of the day was\r\nstill the head landlord of a huge district extending over the whole\r\nbarony of Desmond, and half the adjacent baronies of Muskerry and\r\nDuhallow; but the head landlord\'s rent in many cases hardly amounted\r\nto sixpence an acre, and even those sixpences did not always find\r\ntheir way into the earl\'s pocket. When the late earl had attained\r\nhis sceptre, he might probably have been entitled to spend some ten\r\nthousand a year; but when he died, and during the years just previous\r\nto that, he had hardly been entitled to spend anything.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, the Desmonds were great people, and owned a great\r\nname. They had been kings once over those wild mountains; and would\r\nbe still, some said, if every one had his own. Their grandeur was\r\nshown by the prevalence of their name. The barony in which they lived\r\nwas the barony of Desmond. The river which gave water to their cattle\r\nwas the river Desmond. The wretched, ragged, poverty-stricken village\r\nnear their own dismantled gate was the town of Desmond. The earl was\r\nEarl of Desmond--not Earl Desmond, mark you; and the family name was\r\nDesmond. The grandfather of the present earl, who had repaired his\r\nfortune by selling himself at the time of the Union, had been Desmond\r\nDesmond, Earl of Desmond.\r\n\r\nThe late earl, the friend of the most illustrious person in the\r\nkingdom, had not been utterly able to rob his heir of everything, or\r\nhe would undoubtedly have done so. At the age of twenty-one the young\r\nearl would come into possession of the property, damaged certainly,\r\nas far as an actively evil father could damage it by long leases, bad\r\nmanagement, lack of outlay, and rack-renting;--but still into the\r\npossession of a considerable property. In the mean time it did not\r\nfare very well, in a pecuniary way, with Clara, the widowed countess,\r\nor with the Lady Clara, her daughter. The means at the widow\'s\r\ndisposal were only those which the family trustees would allow her\r\nas the earl\'s mother: on his coming of age she would have almost no\r\nmeans of her own; and for her daughter no provision whatever had been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAs this first chapter is devoted wholly to the locale of my story, I\r\nwill not stop to say a word as to the persons or characters of either\r\nof these two ladies, leaving them, as I did the Castle Richmond\r\nfamily, to come forth upon the canvas as opportunity may offer. But\r\nthere is another homestead in this same barony of Desmond, of which\r\nand of its owner--as being its owner--I will say a word.\r\n\r\nHap House was also the property of a Fitzgerald. It had originally\r\nbeen built by an old Sir Simon Fitzgerald, for the use and behoof\r\nof a second son, and the present owner of it was the grandson of\r\nthat man for whom it had been built. And old Sir Simon had given\r\nhis offspring not only a house--he had endowed the house with\r\na comfortable little slice of land, either cut from the large\r\npatrimonial loaf, or else, as was more probable, collected together\r\nand separately baked for this younger branch of the family. Be that\r\nas it may, Hap House had of late years been always regarded as\r\nconferring some seven or eight hundred a year upon its possessor, and\r\nwhen young Owen Fitzgerald succeeded to this property, on the death\r\nof an uncle in the year 1843, he was regarded as a rich man to that\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nAt that time he was some twenty-two years of age, and he came down\r\nfrom Dublin, where his friends had intended that he should practise\r\nas a barrister, to set up for himself as a country gentleman. Hap\r\nHouse was distant from Castle Richmond about four miles, standing\r\nalso on the river Blackwater, but nearer to Mallow. It was a\r\npleasant, comfortable residence, too large no doubt for such a\r\nproperty, as is so often the case in Ireland; surrounded by pleasant\r\ngrounds and pleasant gardens, with a gorse fox covert belonging to\r\nthe place within a mile of it, with a slated lodge, and a pretty\r\ndrive along the river. At the age of twenty-two, Owen Fitzgerald came\r\ninto all this; and as he at once resided upon the place, he came in\r\nalso for the good graces of all the mothers with unmarried daughters\r\nin the county, and for the smiles also of many of the daughters\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas and Lady Fitzgerald were not his uncle and aunt, but\r\nnevertheless they took kindly to him;--very kindly at first, though\r\nthat kindness after a while became less warm. He was the nearest\r\nrelation of the name; and should anything happen--as the fatal\r\ndeath-foretelling phrase goes--to young Herbert Fitzgerald, he would\r\nbecome the heir of the family title and of the family place.\r\n\r\nWhen I hear of a young man sitting down by himself as the master of\r\na household, without a wife, or even without a mother or sister to\r\nguide him, I always anticipate danger. If he does not go astray in\r\nany other way, he will probably mismanage his money matters. And then\r\nthere are so many other ways. A house, if it be not made pleasant by\r\ndomestic pleasant things, must be made pleasant by pleasure. And a\r\nbachelor\'s pleasures in his own house are always dangerous. There is\r\ntoo much wine drunk at his dinner parties. His guests sit too long\r\nover their cards. The servants know that they want a mistress; and,\r\nin the absence of that mistress, the language of the household\r\nbecomes loud and harsh--and sometimes improper. Young men among us\r\nseldom go quite straight in their course, unless they are, at any\r\nrate occasionally, brought under the influence of tea and small talk.\r\n\r\nThere was no tea and small talk at Hap House, but there were\r\nhunting-dinners. Owen Fitzgerald was soon known for his horses\r\nand his riding. He lived in the very centre of the Duhallow hunt;\r\nand before he had been six months owner of his property had built\r\nadditional stables, with half a dozen loose boxes for his friends\'\r\nnags. He had an eye, too, for a pretty girl--not always in the way\r\nthat is approved of by mothers with marriageable daughters; but in\r\nthe way of which they so decidedly disapprove.\r\n\r\nAnd thus old ladies began to say bad things. Those pleasant\r\nhunting-dinners were spoken of as the Hap House orgies. It was\r\ndeclared that men slept there half the day, having played cards all\r\nthe night; and dreadful tales were told. Of these tales one-half was\r\ndoubtless false. But, alas, alas! what if one-half were also true?\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly a very dangerous thing for a young man of\r\ntwenty-two to keep house by himself, either in town or country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOWEN FITZGERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tied myself down to thirteen years ago as the time of my\r\nstory; but I must go back a little beyond this for its first scenes,\r\nand work my way up as quickly as may be to the period indicated. I\r\nhave spoken of a winter in which Herbert Fitzgerald was at home at\r\nCastle Richmond, having then completed his Oxford doings; but I must\r\nsay something of two years previous to that, of a time when Herbert\r\nwas not so well known in the county as was his cousin of Hap House.\r\n\r\nIt was a thousand pities that a bad word should ever have been spoken\r\nof Owen Fitzgerald; ten thousand pities that he should ever have\r\ngiven occasion for such bad word. He was a fine, high-spirited,\r\nhandsome fellow, with a loving heart within his breast, and\r\nbright thoughts within his brain. It was utterly wrong that a man\r\nconstituted as he was should commence life by living alone in a large\r\ncountry-house. But those who spoke ill of him should have remembered\r\nthat this was his misfortune rather than his fault. Some greater\r\nendeavour might perhaps have been made to rescue him from evil ways.\r\nVery little such endeavour was made at all. Sir Thomas once or\r\ntwice spoke to him; but Sir Thomas was not an energetic man; and\r\nas for Lady Fitzgerald, though she was in many things all that was\r\nexcellent, she was far too diffident to attempt the reformation of a\r\nheadstrong young man, who after all was only distantly connected with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd thus there was no such attempt, and poor Owen became the subject\r\nof ill report without any substantial effort having been made to save\r\nhim. He was a very handsome man--tall, being somewhat over six feet\r\nin height--athletic, almost more than in proportion--with short,\r\nlight chestnut-tinted hair, blue eyes, and a mouth perfect as that\r\nof Phoebus. He was clever, too, though perhaps not educated as\r\ncarefully as might have been: his speech was usually rapid, hearty,\r\nand short, and not seldom caustic and pointed. Had he fallen among\r\ngood hands, he might have done very well in the world\'s fight; but\r\nwith such a character, and lacking such advantages, it was quite as\r\nopen to him to do ill. Alas! the latter chance seemed to have fallen\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nFor the first year of his residence at Hap House, he was popular\r\nenough among his neighbours. The Hap House orgies were not commenced\r\nat once, nor when commenced did they immediately become a subject of\r\nscandal; and even during the second year he was tolerated;--tolerated\r\nby all, and still flattered by some.\r\n\r\nAmong the different houses in the country at which he had become\r\nintimate was that of the Countess of Desmond. The Countess of Desmond\r\ndid not receive much company at Desmond Court. She had not the means,\r\nnor perhaps the will, to fill the huge old house with parties of her\r\nIrish neighbours--for she herself was English to the backbone. Ladies\r\nof course made morning calls, and gentlemen too, occasionally; but\r\nsociety at Desmond Court was for some years pretty much confined to\r\nthis cold formal mode of visiting. Owen Fitzgerald, however, did\r\nobtain admittance into the precincts of the Desmond barracks.\r\n\r\nHe went there first with the young earl, who, then quite a boy, had\r\nhad an ugly tumble from his pony in the hunting-field. The countess\r\nhad expressed herself as very grateful for young Fitzgerald\'s care,\r\nand thus an intimacy had sprung up. Owen had gone there once or twice\r\nto see the lad, and on those occasions had dined there; and on one\r\noccasion, at the young earl\'s urgent request, had stayed and slept.\r\n\r\nAnd then the good-natured people of Muskerry, Duhallow, and Desmond\r\nbegan, of course, to say that the widow was going to marry the young\r\nman. And why not? she was still a beautiful woman; not yet forty by a\r\ngood deal, said the few who took her part; or at any rate, not much\r\nover, as was admitted by the many who condemned her. We, who have\r\nbeen admitted to her secrets, know that she was then in truth only\r\nthirty-eight. She was beautiful, proud, and clever; and if it would\r\nsuit her to marry a handsome young fellow with a good house and an\r\nunembarrassed income of eight hundred a year, why should she not\r\ndo so? As for him, would it not be a great thing for him to have a\r\ncountess for his wife, and an earl for his stepson?\r\n\r\nWhat ideas the countess had on this subject we will not just now\r\ntrouble ourselves to inquire. But as to young Owen Fitzgerald, we\r\nmay declare at once that no thought of such a wretched alliance ever\r\nentered his head. He was sinful in many things, and foolish in many\r\nthings. But he had not that vile sin, that unmanly folly, which would\r\nhave made a marriage with a widowed countess eligible in his eyes,\r\nmerely because she was a countess, and not more than fifteen years\r\nhis senior. In a matter of love he would as soon have thought of\r\npaying his devotions to his far-away cousin, old Miss Barbara\r\nBeamish, of Ballyclahassan, of whom it was said that she had set her\r\ncap at every unmarried man that had come into the west riding of the\r\ncounty for the last forty years. No; it may at any rate be said of\r\nOwen Fitzgerald, that he was not the man to make up to a widowed\r\ncountess for the sake of the reflected glitter which might fall on\r\nhim from her coronet.\r\n\r\nBut the Countess of Desmond was not the only lady at Desmond Court. I\r\nhave before said that she had a daughter, the Lady Clara, the heroine\r\nof this coming story; and it may be now right that I should attempt\r\nsome short description of her; her virtues and faults, her merits and\r\ndefects. It shall be very short; for let an author describe as he\r\nwill, he cannot by such course paint the characters of his personages\r\non the minds of his readers. It is by gradual, earnest efforts that\r\nthis must be done--if it be done. Ten, nay, twenty pages of the\r\nfinest descriptive writing that ever fell from the pen of a novelist\r\nwill not do it.\r\n\r\nClara Desmond, when young Fitzgerald first saw her, had hardly\r\nattained that incipient stage of womanhood which justifies a mother\r\nin taking her out into the gaieties of the world. She was then only\r\nsixteen; and had not in her manner and appearance so much of the\r\nwoman as is the case with many girls of that age. She was shy and\r\ndiffident in manner, thin and tall in person. If I were to say that\r\nshe was angular and bony, I should disgust my readers, who, disliking\r\nthe term, would not stop to consider how many sweetest girls are\r\nat that age truly subject to those epithets. Their undeveloped but\r\nactive limbs are long and fleshless, the contour of their face is the\r\nsame, their elbows and shoulders are pointed, their feet and hands\r\nseem to possess length without breadth. Birth and breeding have given\r\nthem the frame of beauty, to which coming years will add the soft\r\nroundness of form, and the rich glory of colour. The plump, rosy\r\ngirl of fourteen, though she also is very sweet, never rises to such\r\ncelestial power of feminine grace as she who is angular and bony,\r\nwhose limbs are long, and whose joints are sharp.\r\n\r\nSuch was Clara Desmond at sixteen. But still, even then, to those\r\nwho were gifted with the power of seeing, she gave promise of great\r\nloveliness. Her eyes were long and large, and wonderfully clear.\r\nThere was a liquid depth in them which enabled the gazer to look down\r\ninto them as he would into the green, pellucid transparency of still\r\nocean water. And then they said so much--those young eyes of hers:\r\nfrom her mouth in those early years words came but scantily, but from\r\nher eyes questions rained quicker than any other eyes could answer\r\nthem. Questions of wonder at what the world contained,--of wonder as\r\nto what men thought and did; questions as to the inmost heart, and\r\ntruth, and purpose of the person questioned. And all this was asked\r\nby a glance now and again; by a glance of those long, shy, liquid\r\neyes, which were ever falling on the face of him she questioned, and\r\nthen ever as quickly falling from it.\r\n\r\nHer face, as I have said, was long and thin, but it was the longness\r\nand thinness of growing youth. The natural lines of it were full of\r\nbeauty, of pale silent beauty, too proud in itself to boast itself\r\nmuch before the world, to make itself common among many. Her hair was\r\nalready long and rich, but was light in colour, much lighter than\r\nit grew to be when some four or five more years had passed over her\r\nhead. At the time of which I speak she wore it in simple braids\r\nbrushed back from her forehead, not having as yet learned that\r\nmajestic mode of sweeping it from her face which has in subsequent\r\nyears so generally prevailed.\r\n\r\nAnd what then of her virtues and her faults--of her merits and\r\ndefects? Will it not be better to leave them all to time and the\r\ncoming pages? That she was proud of her birth, proud of being an\r\nIrish Desmond, proud even of her poverty, so much I may say of her,\r\neven at that early age. In that she was careless of the world\'s\r\nesteem, fond to a fault of romance, poetic in her temperament, and\r\ntender in her heart, she shared the ordinary--shall I say foibles or\r\nvirtues?--of so many of her sex. She was passionately fond of her\r\nbrother, but not nearly equally so of her mother, of whom the brother\r\nwas too evidently the favoured child.\r\n\r\nShe had lived much alone; alone, that is, with her governess and\r\nwith servants at Desmond Court. Not that she had been neglected by\r\nher mother, but she had hardly found herself to be her mother\'s\r\ncompanion; and other companions there she had had none. When she was\r\nsixteen her governess was still with her; but a year later than that\r\nshe was left quite alone, except inasmuch as she was with her mother.\r\n\r\nShe was sixteen when she first began to ask questions of Owen\r\nFitzgerald\'s face with those large eyes of hers; and she saw much\r\nof him, and he of her, for the twelve months immediately after that.\r\nMuch of him, that is, as much goes in this country of ours, where\r\nfour or five interviews in as many months between friends is supposed\r\nto signify that they are often together. But this much-seeing\r\noccurred chiefly during the young earl\'s holidays. Now and again\r\nhe did ride over in the long intervals, and when he did do so was\r\nnot frowned upon by the countess; and so, at the end of the winter\r\nholidays subsequent to that former winter in which the earl had had\r\nhis tumble, people through the county began to say that he and the\r\ncountess were about to become man and wife.\r\n\r\nIt was just then that people in the county were also beginning to\r\ntalk of the Hap House orgies; and the double scandal reached Owen\'s\r\nears, one shortly after the other. That orgies scandal did not\r\nhurt him much. It is, alas! too true that consciousness of such a\r\nreputation does not often hurt a young man\'s feelings. But the other\r\nrumour did wound him. What! he sell himself to a widowed countess\r\nalmost old enough to be his mother; or bestow himself rather,--for\r\nwhat was there in return that could be reckoned as a price? At any\r\nrate, he had given no one cause to utter such falsehood, such calumny\r\nas that. No; it certainly was not probable that he should marry the\r\ncountess.\r\n\r\nBut this set him to ask himself whether it might or might not be\r\npossible that he should marry some one else. Might it not be well\r\nfor him if he could find a younger bride at Desmond Court? Not for\r\nnothing had he ridden over there through those bleak mountains;\r\nnot for nothing, nor yet solely with the view of tying flies for\r\nthe young earl\'s summer fishing, or preparing the new nag for\r\nhis winter\'s hunting. Those large bright eyes had asked him many\r\nquestions. Would it not be well that he should answer them?\r\n\r\nFor many months of that year Clara Desmond had hardly spoken to\r\nhim. Then, in the summer evening, as he and her brother would lie\r\nsprawling together on the banks of the little Desmond river, while\r\nthe lad was talking of his fish, and his school, and his cricket\r\nclub, she would stand by and listen, and so gradually she learned to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nAnd the mother also would sometimes be there; or else she would\r\nwelcome Fitzgerald in to tea, and let him stay there talking as\r\nthough they were all at home, till he would have to make a midnight\r\nride of it before he reached Hap House. It seemed that no fear as to\r\nher daughter had ever crossed the mother\'s mind; that no idea had\r\never come upon her that her favoured visitor might learn to love the\r\nyoung girl with whom he was allowed to associate on so intimate a\r\nfooting. Once or twice he had caught himself calling her Clara, and\r\nhad done so even before her mother; but no notice had been taken of\r\nit. In truth, Lady Desmond did not know her daughter, for the mother\r\ntook her absolutely to be a child, when in fact she was a child no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n"You take Clara round by the bridge," said the earl to his friend one\r\nAugust evening, as they were standing together on the banks of the\r\nriver, about a quarter of a mile distant from the sombre old pile in\r\nwhich the family lived. "You take Clara round by the bridge, and I\r\nwill get over the stepping-stones." And so the lad, with his rod in\r\nhis hand, began to descend the steep bank.\r\n\r\n"I can get over the stepping-stones, too, Patrick," said she.\r\n\r\n"Can you though, my gay young woman? You\'ll be over your ankles if\r\nyou do. That rain didn\'t come down yesterday for nothing."\r\n\r\nClara as she spoke had come up to the bank, and now looked wistfully\r\ndown at the stepping-stones. She had crossed them scores of times,\r\nsometimes with her brother, and often by herself. Why was it that she\r\nwas so anxious to cross them now?\r\n\r\n"It\'s no use your trying," said her brother, who was now half across,\r\nand who spoke from the middle of the river. "Don\'t you let her, Owen.\r\nShe\'ll slip in, and then there will be no end of a row up at the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"You had better come round by the bridge," said Fitzgerald. "It is\r\nnot only that the stones are nearly under water, but they are wet,\r\nand you would slip."\r\n\r\nSo cautioned, Lady Clara allowed herself to be persuaded, and turned\r\nupwards along the river by a little path that led to a foot bridge.\r\nIt was some quarter of a mile thither, and it would be the same\r\ndistance down the river again before she regained her brother.\r\n\r\n"I needn\'t bring you with me, you know," she said to Fitzgerald. "You\r\ncan get over the stones easily, and I can go very well by myself."\r\n\r\nBut it was not probable that he would let her do so. "Why should I\r\nnot go with you?" he said. "When I get there I have nothing to do but\r\nsee him fish. Only if we were to leave him by himself he would not be\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, how very kind you are to him! I do so often\r\nthink of it. How dull his holidays would be in this place if it were\r\nnot for you!"\r\n\r\n"And what a godsend his holidays are to me!" said Owen. "When they\r\ncome round I can ride over here and see him, and you--and your\r\nmother. Do you think that I am not dull also, living alone at Hap\r\nHouse, and that this is not an infinite blessing to me?"\r\n\r\nHe had named them all--son, daughter, and mother; but there had been\r\na something in his voice, an almost inappreciable something in his\r\ntone, which had seemed to mark to Clara\'s hearing that she herself\r\nwas not the least prized of the three attractions. She had felt this\r\nrather than realized it, and the feeling was not unpleasant.\r\n\r\n"I only know that you are very goodnatured," she continued, "and that\r\nPatrick is very fond of you. Sometimes I think he almost takes you\r\nfor a brother." And then a sudden thought flashed across her mind,\r\nand she said hardly a word more to him that evening.\r\n\r\nThis had been at the close of the summer holidays. After that he had\r\nbeen once or twice at Desmond Court, before the return of the boy\r\nfrom Eton; but on these occasions he had been more with the countess\r\nthan with her daughter. On the last of these visits, just before\r\nthe holidays commenced, he had gone over respecting a hunter he had\r\nbought for Lord Desmond, and on this occasion he did not even see\r\nClara.\r\n\r\nThe countess, when she had thanked him for his trouble in the matter\r\nof the purchase, hesitated a moment, and then went on to speak of\r\nother matters.\r\n\r\n"I understand, Mr. Fitzgerald," said she, "that you have been very\r\ngay at Hap House since the hunting commenced."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," said Owen, half laughing and half blushing. "It\'s\r\na convenient place for some of the men, and one must be sociable."\r\n\r\n"Sociable! yes, one ought to be sociable certainly. But I am always\r\nafraid of the sociability of young men without ladies. Do not be\r\nangry with me if I venture as a friend to ask you not to be too\r\nsociable."\r\n\r\n"I know what you mean, Lady Desmond. People have been accusing us\r\nof--of being rakes. Isn\'t that it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Fitzgerald, that is it. But then I know that I have no\r\nright to speak to you on such a--such a subject."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; you have every right," said he, warmly; "more right than\r\nany one else."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; Sir Thomas, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, Sir Thomas. Sir Thomas is very well, and so also is Lady\r\nFitzgerald; but I do not feel the same interest about them that I\r\ndo about you. And they are such humdrum, quiet-going people. As for\r\nHerbert, I\'m afraid he\'ll turn out a prig."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Fitzgerald, if you give me the right I shall use it." And\r\ngetting up from her chair, and coming to him where he stood, she\r\nlooked kindly into his face. It was a bonny, handsome face for a\r\nwoman to gaze on, and there was much kindness in hers as she smiled\r\non him. Nay, there was almost more than kindness, he thought, as he\r\ncaught her eye. It was like,--almost like the sweetness of motherly\r\nlove. "And I shall scold you," she continued. "People say that for\r\ntwo or three nights running men have been playing cards at Hap House\r\ntill morning."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I had some men there for a week. I could not take their candles\r\naway, and put them to bed; could I, Lady Desmond?"\r\n\r\n"And there were late suppers, and drinking of toasts, and headaches\r\nin the morning, and breakfast at three o\'clock, and gentlemen with\r\nvery pale faces when they appeared rather late at the meet--eh, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald?" And she held up one finger at him, as she upbraided\r\nhim with a smile. The smile was so sweet, so unlike her usual look;\r\nthat, to tell the truth, was often too sad and careworn for her age.\r\n\r\n"Such things do happen, Lady Desmond."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; they do happen. And with such a one as you, heaven knows\r\nI do not begrudge the pleasure, if it were but now and then,--once\r\nagain and then done with. But you are too bright and too good for\r\nsuch things to continue." And she took his hand and pressed it, as\r\na mother or a mother\'s dearest friend might have done. "It would so\r\ngrieve me to think that you should be even in danger of shipwreck.\r\n\r\n"You will not be angry with me for taking this liberty?" she\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n"Angry! how could any man be angry for such kindness?"\r\n\r\n"And you will think of what I say. I would not have you unsociable,\r\nor morose, or inhospitable; but--"\r\n\r\n"I understand, Lady Desmond; but when young men are together, one\r\ncannot always control them."\r\n\r\n"But you will try. Say that you will try because I have asked you."\r\n\r\nHe promised that he would, and then went his way, proud in his heart\r\nat this solicitude. And how could he not be proud? was she not high\r\nin rank, proud in character, beautiful withal, and the mother of\r\nClara Desmond? What sweeter friend could a man have; what counsellor\r\nmore potent to avert those dangers which now hovered round his head?\r\n\r\nAnd as he rode home he was half in love with the countess. Where is\r\nthe young man who has not in his early years been half in love with\r\nsome woman older, much older than himself, who has half conquered his\r\nheart by her solicitude for his welfare?--with some woman who has\r\nwhispered to him while others were talking, who has told him in such\r\ngentle, loving tones of his boyish follies, whose tenderness and\r\nexperience together have educated him and made him manly? Young men\r\nare so proud, proud in their inmost hearts, of such tenderness and\r\nsolicitude, as long as it remains secret and wrapt as it were in\r\na certain mystery. Such liaisons have the interests of intrigue,\r\nwithout--I was going to say without its dangers. Alas! it may be that\r\nit is not always so.\r\n\r\nOwen Fitzgerald as he rode home was half in love with the countess.\r\nNot that his love was of a kind which made him in any way desirous\r\nof marrying her, or of kneeling at her feet and devoting himself to\r\nher for ever; not that it in any way interfered with the other love\r\nwhich he was beginning to feel for her daughter. But he thought with\r\npleasure of the tone of her voice, of the pressure of her hand, of\r\nthe tenderness which he had found in her eye.\r\n\r\nIt was after that time, as will be understood, that some goodnatured\r\nfriend had told him that he was regarded in the county as the future\r\nhusband of Lady Desmond. At first he laughed at this as being--as\r\nhe himself said to himself--too good a joke. When the report\r\nfirst reached him, it seemed to be a joke which he could share so\r\npleasantly with the countess. For men of three and twenty, though\r\nthey are so fond of the society of women older than themselves,\r\nunderstand so little the hearts and feelings of such women. In his\r\nideas there was an interval as of another generation between him and\r\nthe countess. In her thoughts the interval was probably much less\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nBut the accusation was made to him again and again till it wounded\r\nhim, and he gave up that notion of a mutual joke with his kind friend\r\nat Desmond Court. It did not occur to him that she could ever think\r\nof loving him as her lord and master; but it was brought home to him\r\nthat other people thought so.\r\n\r\nA year had now passed by since those winter holidays in which Clara\r\nDesmond had been sixteen, and during which she was described by\r\nepithets which will not, I fear, have pleased my readers. Those\r\nepithets were now somewhat less deserved, but still the necessity\r\nof them had not entirely passed away. Her limbs were still thin\r\nand long, and her shoulders pointed; but the growth of beauty had\r\ncommenced, and in Owen\'s eyes she was already very lovely.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas-time during that winter a ball was given at Castle\r\nRichmond, to celebrate the coming of age of the young heir. It was\r\nnot a very gay affair, for the Castle Richmond folk, even in those\r\ndays, were not very gay people. Sir Thomas, though only fifty, was\r\nan old man for his age; and Lady Fitzgerald, though known intimately\r\nby the poor all round her, was not known intimately by any but the\r\npoor. Mary and Emmeline Fitzgerald, with whom we shall become better\r\nacquainted as we advance in our story, were nice, good girls, and\r\nhandsome withal; but they had not that special gift which enables\r\nsome girls to make a party in their own house bright in spite of all\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\nWe should have but little to do with this ball, were it not that\r\nClara Desmond was here first brought out, as the term goes. It was\r\nthe first large party to which she had been taken, and it was to her\r\na matter of much wonder and inquiry with those wondering, speaking\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAnd Owen Fitzgerald was there;--as a matter of course, the reader\r\nwill say. By no means so. Previous to that ball Owen\'s sins had been\r\ncommented upon at Castle Richmond, and Sir Thomas had expostulated\r\nwith him. These expostulations had not been received quite so\r\ngraciously as those of the handsome countess, and there had been\r\nanger at Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\nNow there was living in the house of Castle Richmond one Miss Letty\r\nFitzgerald, a maiden sister of the baronet\'s, older than her brother\r\nby full ten years. In her character there was more of energy, and\r\nalso much more of harsh judgment, and of consequent ill-nature, than\r\nin that of her brother. When the letters of invitation were being\r\nsent out by the two girls, she had given a decided opinion that the\r\nreprobate should not be asked. But the reprobate\'s cousins, with that\r\npartiality for a rake which is so common to young ladies, would not\r\nabide by their aunt\'s command, and referred the matter both to mamma\r\nand papa. Mamma thought it very hard that their own cousin should be\r\nrefused admittance to their house, and very dreadful that his sins\r\nshould be considered to be of so deep a dye as to require so severe a\r\nsentence; and then papa, much balancing the matter, gave final orders\r\nthat the prodigal cousin should be admitted.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted, and dangerously he used the privilege. The countess,\r\nwho was there, stood up to dance twice, and twice only. She opened\r\nthe ball with young Herbert Fitzgerald the heir; and in about an hour\r\nafterwards she danced again with Owen. He did not ask her twice; but\r\nhe asked her daughter three or four times, and three or four times he\r\nasked her successfully.\r\n\r\n"Clara," whispered the mother to her child, after the last of these\r\noccasions, giving some little pull or twist to her girl\'s frock as\r\nshe did so, "you had better not dance with Owen Fitzgerald again\r\nto-night. People will remark about it."\r\n\r\n"Will they?" said Clara, and immediately sat down, checked in her\r\nyoung happiness.\r\n\r\nNot many minutes afterwards, Owen came up to her again. "May we have\r\nanother waltz together, I wonder?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Not to-night, I think. I am rather tired already." And so she did\r\nnot waltz again all the evening, for fear she should offend him.\r\n\r\nBut the countess, though she had thus interdicted her daughter\'s\r\ndancing with the master of Hap House, had not done so through any\r\nabsolute fear. To her, her girl was still a child; a child without\r\na woman\'s thoughts, or any of a woman\'s charms. And then it was\r\nso natural that Clara should like to dance with almost the only\r\ngentleman who was not absolutely a stranger to her. Lady Desmond had\r\nbeen actuated rather by a feeling that it would be well that Clara\r\nshould begin to know other persons.\r\n\r\nBy that feeling,--and perhaps unconsciously by another, that it would\r\nbe well that Owen Fitzgerald should be relieved from his attendance\r\non the child, and enabled to give it to the mother. Whether Lady\r\nDesmond had at that time realized any ideas as to her own interest\r\nin this young man, it was at any rate true that she loved to have\r\nhim near her. She had refused to dance a second time with Herbert\r\nFitzgerald; she had refused to stand up with any other person who had\r\nasked her; but with Owen she would either have danced again, or have\r\nkept him by her side, while she explained to him with flattering\r\nfrankness that she could not do so lest others should be offended.\r\n\r\nAnd Owen was with her frequently through the evening. She was taken\r\nto and from supper by Sir Thomas, but any other takings that were\r\nincurred were done by him. He led her from one drawing-room to\r\nanother; he took her empty coffee-cup; he stood behind her chair,\r\nand talked to her; and he brought her the scarf which she had left\r\nelsewhere; and finally, he put a shawl round her neck while old Sir\r\nThomas was waiting to hand her to her carriage. Reader, good-natured,\r\nmiddle-aged reader, remember that she was only thirty-eight, and that\r\nhitherto she had known nothing of the delights of love. By the young,\r\nany such hallucination on her part, at her years, will be regarded as\r\nlunacy, or at least frenzy.\r\n\r\nOwen Fitzgerald drove home from that ball in a state of mind that\r\nwas hardly satisfactory. In the first place, Miss Letty had made a\r\ndirect attack upon his morals, which he had not answered in the most\r\ncourteous manner.\r\n\r\n"I have heard a great deal of your doings, Master Owen," she said to\r\nhim. "A fine house you\'re keeping."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come and join us, Aunt Letty?" he replied. "It would\r\nbe just the thing for you."\r\n\r\n"God forbid!" said the old maid, turning up her eyes to heaven.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you might do worse, you know. With us you\'d only drink and\r\nplay cards, and perhaps hear a little strong language now and again.\r\nBut what\'s that to slander, and calumny, and bearing false witness\r\nagainst one\'s neighbour?" and so saying he ended that interview--not\r\nin a manner to ingratiate himself with his relative, Miss Letty\r\nFitzgerald.\r\n\r\nAfter that, in the supper-room, more than one wag of a fellow had\r\ncongratulated him on his success with the widow. "She\'s got some\r\nsort of a jointure, I suppose," said one. "She\'s very young-looking,\r\ncertainly, to be the mother of that girl," declared another. "Upon my\r\nword, she\'s a handsome woman still," said a third. "And what title\r\nwill you get when you marry her, Fitz?" asked a fourth, who was\r\nrather ignorant as to the phases under which the British peerage\r\ndevelops itself.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald pshawed, and pished, and poohed; and then, breaking away\r\nfrom them, rode home. He felt that he must at any rate put an end to\r\nthis annoyance about the countess, and that he must put an end also\r\nto his state of doubt about the countess\'s daughter. Clara had been\r\nkind and gracious to him in the first part of the evening; nay,\r\nalmost more than gracious. Why had she been so cold when he went up\r\nto her on that last occasion? why had she gathered herself like a\r\nsnail into its shell for the rest of the evening?\r\n\r\nThe young earl had also been at the party, and had exacted a promise\r\nfrom Owen that he would be over at Desmond Court on the next day. It\r\nhad almost been on Owen\'s lips to tell his friend, not only that he\r\nwould be there, but what would be his intention when he got there.\r\nHe knew that the lad loved him well; and almost fancied that, earl\r\nas he was, he would favour his friend\'s suit. But a feeling that\r\nLord Desmond was only a boy, restrained him. It would not be well to\r\ninduce one so young to agree to an arrangement of which in after and\r\nmore mature years he would so probably disapprove.\r\n\r\nBut not the less did Fitzgerald, as he drove home, determine that\r\non the next day he would know something of his fate: and with this\r\nresolve he endeavoured to comfort himself as he drove up into his own\r\navenue, and betook himself to his own solitary home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCLARA DESMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been Clara Desmond\'s first ball, and on the following morning\r\nshe had much to occupy her thoughts. In the first place, had she been\r\npleased or had she not? Had she been most gratified or most pained?\r\n\r\nGirls when they ask themselves such questions seldom give themselves\r\nfair answers. She had liked dancing with Owen Fitzgerald; oh, so\r\nmuch! She had liked dancing with others too, though she had not known\r\nthem, and had hardly spoken to them. The mere act of dancing, with\r\nthe loud music in the room, and the gay dresses and bright lights\r\naround her, had been delightful. But then it had pained her--she knew\r\nnot why, but it had pained her--when her mother told her that people\r\nwould make remarks about her. Had she done anything improper on this\r\nher first entry into the world? Was her conduct to be scanned, and\r\njudged, and condemned, while she was flattering herself that no one\r\nhad noticed her but him who was speaking to her?\r\n\r\nTheir breakfast was late, and the countess sat, as was her wont, with\r\nher book beside her tea-cup, speaking a word every now and again to\r\nher son.\r\n\r\n"Owen will be over here to-day," said he. "We are going to have a\r\nschooling match down on the Callows." Now in Ireland a schooling\r\nmatch means the amusement of teaching your horses to jump.\r\n\r\n"Will he?" said Lady Desmond, looking up from her book for a moment.\r\n"Mind you bring him in to lunch; I want to speak to him."\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t care much about lunch, I fancy," said he; "and, maybe, we\r\nshall be half way to Millstreet by that time."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, but do as I tell you. You expect everybody to be as wild\r\nand wayward as yourself." And the countess smiled on her son in a\r\nmanner which showed that she was proud even of his wildness and his\r\nwaywardness.\r\n\r\nClara had felt that she blushed when she heard that Mr. Fitzgerald\r\nwas to be there that morning. She felt that her own manner became\r\nconstrained, and was afraid that her mother should look at her. Owen\r\nhad said nothing to her about love; and she, child as she was, had\r\nthought nothing about love. But she was conscious of something, she\r\nknew not what. He had touched her hand during those dances as it had\r\nnever been touched before; he had looked into her eyes, and her eyes\r\nhad fallen before his glance; he had pressed her waist, and she had\r\nfelt that there was tenderness in the pressure. So she blushed, and\r\nalmost trembled, when she heard that he was coming, and was glad in\r\nher heart when she found that there was neither anger nor sunshine in\r\nher mother\'s face.\r\n\r\nNot long after breakfast, the earl went out on his horse, and met\r\nOwen at some gate or back entrance. In his opinion the old house was\r\nstupid, and the women in it were stupid companions in the morning.\r\nHis heart for the moment was engaged on the thought of making his\r\nanimal take the most impracticable leaps which he could find, and\r\nit did not occur to him at first to give his mother\'s message to\r\nhis companion. As for lunch, they would get a biscuit and glass of\r\ncherry-brandy at Wat M\'Carthy\'s, of Drumban; and as for his mother\r\nhaving anything to say, that of course went for nothing.\r\n\r\nOwen would have been glad to have gone up to the house, but in that\r\nhe was frustrated by the earl\'s sharpness in catching him. His next\r\nhope was to get through the promised lesson in horse-leaping as\r\nquickly as possible, so that he might return to Desmond Court, and\r\ntake his chance of meeting Clara. But in this he found the earl very\r\ndifficult to manage.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Owen, we won\'t go there," he said, when Fitzgerald proposed a\r\ncanter through some meadows down by the river-side. "There are only\r\na few gripes"--Irish for small ditches--"and I have ridden Fireball\r\nover them a score of times. I want you to come away towards Drumban."\r\n\r\n"Drumban! why Drumban\'s seven miles from here."\r\n\r\n"What matter? Besides, it\'s not six the way I\'ll take you. I want to\r\nsee Wat M\'Carthy especially. He has a litter of puppies there, out of\r\nthat black bitch of his, and I mean to make him give me one of them."\r\n\r\nBut on that morning, Owen Fitzgerald would not allow himself to be\r\ntaken so far a-field as Drumban, even on a mission so important as\r\nthis. The young lord fought the matter stoutly; but it ended by\r\nhis being forced to content himself with picking out all the most\r\ndangerous parts of the fences in the river meadows.\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'ve hardly tried your own mare at all," said the lad,\r\nreproachfully.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to hunt her on Saturday," said Owen; "and she\'ll have\r\nquite enough to do then."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'re very slow to-day. You\'re done up with the dancing, I\r\nthink. And what do you mean to do now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go home with you, I think, and pay my respects to the\r\ncountess."\r\n\r\n"By-the-by, I was to bring you in to lunch. She said she wanted to\r\nsee you. By jingo, I forgot all about it! But you\'ve all become very\r\nstupid among you, I know that." And so they rode back to Desmond\r\nCourt, entering the demesne by one of the straight, dull, level roads\r\nwhich led up to the house.\r\n\r\nBut it did not suit the earl to ride on the road while the grass was\r\nso near him; so they turned off with a curve across what was called\r\nthe park, thus prolonging their return by about double the necessary\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAs they were cantering on, Owen saw her of whom he was in quest\r\nwalking in the road which they had left. His best chance of seeing\r\nher alone had been that of finding her outside the house. He knew\r\nthat the countess rarely or never walked with her daughter, and that,\r\nas the governess was gone, Clara was driven to walk by herself.\r\n\r\n"Desmond," he said, pulling up his horse, "do you go on and tell your\r\nmother that I will be with her almost immediately."\r\n\r\n"Why, where are you off to now?"\r\n\r\n"There is your sister, and I must ask her how she is after the ball;"\r\nand so saying he trotted back in the direction of the road.\r\n\r\nLady Clara had seen them; and though she had hardly turned her head,\r\nshe had seen also how suddenly Mr. Fitzgerald had stopped his horse,\r\nand turned his course when he perceived her. At the first moment she\r\nhad been almost angry with him for riding away from her, and now she\r\nfelt almost angry with him because he did not do so.\r\n\r\nHe slackened his pace as he came near her, and approached her at a\r\nwalk. There was very little of the faint heart about Owen Fitzgerald\r\nat any time, or in anything that he attempted. He had now made up\r\nhis mind fairly to tell Clara Desmond that he loved her, and to ask\r\nfor her love in return. He had resolved to do so, and there was very\r\nlittle doubt but that he would carry out his resolution. But he had\r\nin nowise made up his mind how he should do it, or what his words\r\nshould be. And now that he saw her so near him he wanted a moment to\r\ncollect his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat as he rode up, and asked her whether she was\r\ntired after the ball; and then dismounting, he left his mare to\r\nfollow as she pleased.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, won\'t she run away?" said Clara, as she gave him\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; she has been taught better than that. But you don\'t tell me\r\nhow you are. I thought you were tired last night when I saw that you\r\nhad altogether given over dancing." And then he walked on beside her,\r\nand the docile mare followed them like a dog.\r\n\r\n"No, I was not tired; at least, not exactly," said Clara, blushing\r\nagain and again, being conscious that she blushed. "But--but--you\r\nknow it was the first ball I was ever at."\r\n\r\n"That is just the reason why you should have enjoyed it the more,\r\ninstead of sitting down as you did, and being dull and unhappy. For\r\nI know you were unhappy; I could see it."\r\n\r\n"Was I?" said Clara, not knowing what else to say.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and I\'ll tell you what. I could see more than that; it was I\r\nthat made you unhappy."\r\n\r\n"You, Mr. Fitzgerald!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I. You will not deny it, because you are so true. I asked you\r\nto dance with me too often. And because you refused me, you did not\r\nlike to dance with any one else. I saw it all. Will you deny that it\r\nwas so?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!" Poor girl! She did not know what to say; how to\r\nshape her speech into indifference; how to assure him that he made\r\nhimself out to be of too much consequence by far; how to make it\r\nplain that she had not danced because there was no one there worth\r\ndancing with. Had she been out for a year or two, instead of being\r\nsuch a novice, she would have accomplished all this in half a dozen\r\nwords. As it was, her tell-tale face confessed it all, and she was\r\nonly able to ejaculate, "Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!"\r\n\r\n"When I went there last night," he continued, "I had only one\r\nwish--one hope. That was, to see you pleased and happy. I knew it was\r\nyour first ball, and I did so long to see you enjoy it."\r\n\r\n"And so I did, till--"\r\n\r\n"Till what? Will you not let me ask?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma said something to me, and that stopped me from dancing."\r\n\r\n"She told you not to dance with me. Was that it?"\r\n\r\nHow was it possible that she should have had a chance with him;\r\ninnocent, young, and ignorant as she was? She did not tell him in\r\nwords that so it had been; but she looked into his face with a glance\r\nof doubt and pain that answered his question as plainly as any words\r\ncould have done.\r\n\r\n"Of course she did; and it was I that destroyed it all. I that should\r\nhave been satisfied to stand still and see you happy. How you must\r\nhave hated me!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; indeed I did not. I was not at all angry with you. Indeed,\r\nwhy should I have been? It was so kind of you, wishing to dance with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"No; it was selfish--selfish in the extreme. Nothing but one thing\r\ncould excuse me, and that excuse--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you don\'t want any excuse, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"And that excuse, Clara, was this: that I love you with all my heart.\r\nI had not strength to see you there, and not long to have you near\r\nme--not begrudge that you should dance with another. I love you with\r\nall my heart and soul. There, Lady Clara, now you know it all."\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he made his declaration to her was almost fierce\r\nin its energy. He had stopped in the pathway, and she, unconscious\r\nof what she was doing, almost unconscious of what she was hearing,\r\nhad stopped also. The mare, taking advantage of the occasion, was\r\ncropping the grass close to them. And so, for a few seconds, they\r\nstood in silence.\r\n\r\n"Am I so bold, Lady Clara," said he, when those few seconds had gone\r\nby--"Am I so bold that I may hope for no answer?" But still she\r\nsaid nothing. In lieu of speaking she uttered a long sigh; and then\r\nFitzgerald could hear that she was sobbing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Clara, I love you so fondly, so dearly, so truly!" said he in an\r\naltered voice and with sweet tenderness. "I know my own presumption\r\nin thus speaking. I know and feel bitterly the difference in our\r\nrank."\r\n\r\n"I--care--nothing--for rank," said the poor girl, sobbing through her\r\ntears. He was generous, and she at any rate would not be less so. No;\r\nat that moment, with her scanty seventeen years of experience, with\r\nher ignorance of all that the world had in it of grand and great, of\r\nhigh and rich, she did care nothing for rank. That Owen Fitzgerald\r\nwas a gentleman of good lineage, fit to mate with a lady, that\r\nshe did know; for her mother, who was a proud woman, delighted to\r\nhave him in her presence. Beyond this she cared for none of the\r\nconventionalities of life. Rank! If she waited for rank, where was\r\nshe to look for friends who would love her? Earls and countesses,\r\nbarons and their baronesses, were scarce there where fate had placed\r\nher, under the shadow of the bleak mountains of Muskerry. Her want,\r\nher undefined want, was that some one should love her. Of all men\r\nand women whom she had hitherto known, this Owen Fitzgerald was the\r\nbrightest, the kindest, the gentlest in his manner, the most pleasant\r\nto look on. And now he was there at her feet, swearing that he loved\r\nher;--and then drawing back as it were in dread of her rank. What did\r\nshe care for rank?\r\n\r\n"Clara, Clara, my Clara! Can you learn to love me?"\r\n\r\nShe had made her one little effort at speaking when she attempted to\r\nrepudiate the pedestal on which he affected to place her; but after\r\nthat she could for a while say no more. But she still sobbed, and\r\nstill kept her eyes fixed upon the ground.\r\n\r\n"Clara, say one word to me. Say that you do not hate me." But just at\r\nthat moment she had not one word to say.\r\n\r\n"If you will bid me do so, I will leave this country altogether. I\r\nwill go away, and I shall not much care whither. I can only stay now\r\non condition of your loving me. I have thought of this day for the\r\nlast year past, and now it has come."\r\n\r\nEvery word that he now spoke was gospel to her. Is it not always\r\nso,--should it not be so always, when love first speaks to loving\r\nears? What! he had loved her for that whole twelvemonth that she had\r\nknown him; loved her in those days when she had been wont to look up\r\ninto his face, wondering why he was so nice, so much nicer than any\r\none else that came near her! A year was a great deal to her; and had\r\nhe loved her through all those days? and after that should she banish\r\nhim from her house, turn him away from his home, and drive him forth\r\nunhappy and wretched? Ah, no! She could not be so unkind to him;--she\r\ncould not be so unkind to her own heart. But still she sobbed; and\r\nstill she said nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time they had turned, and were now walking back towards\r\nthe house, the gentle-natured mare still following at their heels.\r\nThey were walking slowly--very slowly back--just creeping along the\r\npath, when they saw Lady Desmond and her son coming to meet them on\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n"There is your mother, Clara. Say one word to me before we meet\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald; I am so frightened. What will mamma say?"\r\n\r\n"Say about what? As yet I do not know what she may have to say. But\r\nbefore we meet her, may I not hope to know what her daughter will\r\nsay? Answer me this, Clara. Can you, will you love me?"\r\n\r\nThere was still a pause, a moment\'s pause, and then some sound did\r\nfall from her lips. But yet it was so soft, so gentle, so slight,\r\nthat it could hardly be said to reach even a lover\'s ear. Fitzgerald,\r\nhowever, made the most of it. Whether it were Yes, or whether it were\r\nNo, he took it as being favourable, and Lady Clara Desmond gave him\r\nno sign to show that he was mistaken.\r\n\r\n"My own, own, only loved one," he said, embracing her as it were with\r\nhis words, since the presence of her approaching mother forbade him\r\neven to take her hand in his, "I am happy now, whatever may occur;\r\nwhatever others may say; for I know that you will be true to me. And\r\nremember this--whatever others may say, I also will be true to you.\r\nYou will think of that, will you not, love?"\r\n\r\nThis time she did answer him, almost audibly. "Yes," she said. And\r\nthen she devoted herself to a vain endeavour to remove the traces of\r\nher tears before her mother should be close to them.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald at once saw that such endeavour must be vain. At one time\r\nhe had thought of turning away, and pretending that they had not seen\r\nthe countess. But he knew that Clara would not be able to carry out\r\nany such pretence; and he reflected also that it might be just as\r\nwell that Lady Desmond should know the whole at once. That she would\r\nknow it, and know it soon, he was quite sure. She could learn it\r\nnot only from Clara, but from himself. He could not now be there at\r\nthe house without showing that he both loved and knew that he was\r\nbeloved. And then why should Lady Desmond not know it? Why should he\r\nthink that she would set herself against the match? He had certainly\r\nspoken to Clara of the difference in their rank; but, after all, it\r\nwas no uncommon thing for an earl\'s daughter to marry a commoner.\r\nAnd in this case the earl\'s daughter was portionless, and the lover\r\ndesired no portion. Owen Fitzgerald at any rate might boast that he\r\nwas true and generous in his love.\r\n\r\nSo he plucked up his courage, and walked on with a smiling face to\r\nmeet Lady Desmond and her son; while poor Clara crept beside him with\r\neyes downcast, and in an agony of terror.\r\n\r\nLady Desmond had not left the house with any apprehension that there\r\nwas aught amiss. Her son had told her that Owen had gone off "to do\r\nthe civil to Clara;" and as he did not come to the house within some\r\ntwenty minutes after this, she had proposed that they would go and\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\n"Did you tell him that I wanted him?" said the countess.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I did; and he is coming, only he would go away to Clara."\r\n\r\n"Then I shall scold him for his want of gallantry," said Lady\r\nDesmond, laughing, as they walked out together from beneath the huge\r\nportal.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as she was near enough to see the manner of their gait,\r\nas they slowly came on towards her, her woman\'s tact told her that\r\nsomething was wrong;--and whispered to her also what might too\r\nprobably be the nature of that something. Could it be possible, she\r\nasked herself, that such a man as Owen Fitzgerald should fall in love\r\nwith such a girl as her daughter Clara?\r\n\r\n"What shall I say to mamma?" whispered Clara to him, as they all drew\r\nnear together.\r\n\r\n"Tell her everything."\r\n\r\n"But, Patrick--"\r\n\r\n"I will take him off with me if I can." And then they were all\r\ntogether, standing in the road.\r\n\r\n"I was coming to obey your behests, Lady Desmond," said Fitzgerald,\r\ntrying to look and speak as though he were at his ease.\r\n\r\n"Coming rather tardily, I think," said her ladyship, not altogether\r\nplayfully.\r\n\r\n"I told him you wanted him, as we were crossing to the house," said\r\nthe earl. "Didn\'t I, Owen?"\r\n\r\n"Is anything the matter with Clara?" said Lady Desmond, looking at\r\nher daughter.\r\n\r\n"No, mamma," said Clara; and she instantly began to sob and cry.\r\n\r\n"What is it, sir?" And as she asked she turned to Fitzgerald; and her\r\nmanner now at least had in it nothing playful.\r\n\r\n"Lady Clara is nervous and hysterical. The excitement of the ball has\r\nperhaps been too much for her. I think, Lady Desmond, if you were to\r\ntake her in with you it would be well."\r\n\r\nLady Desmond looked up at him; and he then saw, for the first time,\r\nthat she could if she pleased look very stern. Hitherto her face had\r\nalways worn smiles, had at any rate always been pleasing when he had\r\nseen it. He had never been intimate with her, never intimate enough\r\nto care what her face was like, till that day when he had carried her\r\nson up from the hall door to his room. Then her countenance had been\r\nall anxiety for her darling; and afterwards it had been all sweetness\r\nfor her darling\'s friend. From that day to this present one, Lady\r\nDesmond had ever given him her sweetest smiles.\r\n\r\nBut Fitzgerald was not a man to be cowed by any woman\'s looks. He met\r\nhers by a full, front face in return. He did not allow his eye for a\r\nmoment to fall before hers. And yet he did not look at her haughtily,\r\nor with defiance, but with an aspect which showed that he was ashamed\r\nof nothing that he had done,--whether he had done anything that he\r\nought to be ashamed of or no.\r\n\r\n"Clara," said the countess, in a voice which fell with awful severity\r\non the poor girl\'s ears, "you had better return to the house with\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"And shall I wait on you to-morrow, Lady Desmond?" said Fitzgerald,\r\nin a tone which seemed to the countess to be, in the present state of\r\naffairs, almost impertinent. The man had certainly been misbehaving\r\nhimself; and yet there was not about him the slightest symptom of\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n"Yes; no," said the countess. "That is, I will write a note to you if\r\nit be necessary. Good morning."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Lady Desmond," said Owen. And as he took off his hat with\r\nhis left hand, he put out his right to shake hands with her, as was\r\ncustomary with him. Lady Desmond was at first inclined to refuse the\r\ncourtesy; but she either thought better of such intention, or else\r\nshe had not courage to maintain it; for at parting she did give him\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Lady Clara;" and he also shook hands with her, and it need\r\nhardly be said that there was a lover\'s pressure in the grasp.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," said Clara, through her tears, in the saddest, soberest\r\ntone. He was going away, happy, light hearted, with nothing to\r\ntrouble him. But she had to encounter that fearful task of telling\r\nher own crime. She had to depart with her mother;--her mother, who,\r\nthough never absolutely unkind, had so rarely been tender with her.\r\nAnd then her brother--!\r\n\r\n"Desmond," said Fitzgerald, "walk as far as the lodge with me like a\r\ngood fellow. I have something that I want to say to you."\r\n\r\nThe mother thought for a moment that she would call her son back; but\r\nthen she bethought herself that she also might as well be without\r\nhim. So the young earl, showing plainly by his eyes that he knew that\r\nmuch was the matter, went back with Fitzgerald towards the lodge.\r\n\r\n"What is it you have done now?" said the earl. The boy had some sort\r\nof an idea that the offence committed was with reference to his\r\nsister; and his tone was hardly as gracious as was usual with him.\r\n\r\nThis want of kindliness at the present moment grated on Owen\'s ears;\r\nbut he resolved at once to tell the whole story out, and then leave\r\nit to the earl to take it in dudgeon or in brotherly friendship as he\r\nmight please.\r\n\r\n"Desmond," said he, "can you not guess what has passed between me and\r\nyour sister?"\r\n\r\n"I am not good at guessing," he answered, brusquely.\r\n\r\n"I have told her that I loved her, and would have her for my wife;\r\nand I have asked her to love me in return."\r\n\r\nThere was an open manliness about this which almost disarmed the\r\nearl\'s anger. He had felt a strong attachment to Fitzgerald, and was\r\nvery unwilling to give up his friendship; but, nevertheless, he had\r\nan idea that it was presumption on the part of Mr. Fitzgerald of Hap\r\nHouse to look up to his sister. Between himself and Owen the earl\'s\r\ncoronet never weighed a feather; he could not have abandoned his\r\nboy\'s heart to the man\'s fellowship more thoroughly had that man\r\nbeen an earl as well as himself. But he could not get over the\r\nfeeling that Fitzgerald\'s worldly position was beneath that of\r\nhis sister;--that such a marriage on his sister\'s part would be a\r\nmesalliance. Doubting, therefore, and in some sort dismayed--and in\r\nsome sort also angry--he did not at once give any reply.\r\n\r\n"Well, Desmond, what have you to say to it? You are the head of her\r\nfamily, and young as you are, it is right that I should tell you."\r\n\r\n"Tell me! of course you ought to tell me. I don\'t see what youngness\r\nhas to do with it. What did she say?"\r\n\r\n"Well, she said but little; and a man should never boast that a lady\r\nhas favoured him. But she did not reject me." He paused a moment, and\r\nthen added, "After all, honesty and truth are the best. I have reason\r\nto think that she loves me."\r\n\r\nThe poor young lord felt that he had a double duty, and hardly knew\r\nhow to perform it. He owed a duty to his sister which was paramount\r\nto all others; but then he owed a duty also to the friend who had\r\nbeen so kind to him. He did not know how to turn round upon him and\r\ntell him that he was not fit to marry his sister.\r\n\r\n"And what do you say to it, Desmond?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly know what to say. It would be a very bad match for her.\r\nYou, you know, are a capital fellow; the best fellow going. There is\r\nnobody about anywhere that I like so much."\r\n\r\n"In thinking of your sister, you should put that out of the\r\nquestion."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that\'s just it. I like you for a friend better than any one\r\nelse. But Clara ought--ought--ought--"\r\n\r\n"Ought to look higher, you would say."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that\'s just what I mean. I don\'t want to offend you, you know."\r\n\r\n"Desmond, my boy, I like you the better for it. You are a fine\r\nfellow, and I thoroughly respect you. But let us talk sensibly about\r\nthis. Though your sister\'s rank is high--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t want to talk about rank. That\'s all bosh, and I don\'t\r\ncare about it. But Hap House is a small place, and Clara wouldn\'t be\r\ndoing well; and what\'s more, I am quite sure the countess will not\r\nhear of it."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t approve then?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t say I will."\r\n\r\n"Well, that is honest of you. I am very glad that I have told you at\r\nonce. Clara will tell her mother, and at any rate there will be no\r\nsecrets. Good-bye, old fellow."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," said the earl. Then they shook hands, and Fitzgerald rode\r\noff towards Hap House. Lord Desmond pondered over the matter some\r\ntime, standing alone near the lodge; and then walked slowly back\r\ntowards the mansion. He had said that rank was all bosh; and in so\r\nsaying had at the moment spoken out generously the feelings of his\r\nheart. But that feeling regarded himself rather than his sister; and\r\nif properly analyzed would merely have signified that, though proud\r\nenough of his own rank, he did not require that his friends should be\r\nof the same standing. But as regarded his sister, he certainly would\r\nnot be well pleased to see her marry a small squire with a small\r\nincome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe countess, as she walked back with her daughter towards the house,\r\nhad to bethink herself for a minute or two as to how she should act,\r\nand what she would say. She knew, she felt that she knew, what had\r\noccurred. If her daughter\'s manner had not told her, the downcast\r\neyes, the repressed sobs, the mingled look of shame and fear;--if she\r\nhad not read the truth from these, she would have learned it from the\r\ntone of Fitzgerald\'s voice, and the look of triumph which sat upon\r\nhis countenance.\r\n\r\nAnd then she wondered that this should be so, seeing that she had\r\nstill regarded Clara as being in all things a child; and as she\r\nthought further, she wondered at her own fatuity, in that she had\r\nallowed herself to be so grossly deceived.\r\n\r\n"Clara," said she, "what is all this?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma!"\r\n\r\n"You had better come on to the house, my dear, and speak to me there.\r\nIn the mean time, collect your thoughts, and remember this, Clara,\r\nthat you have the honour of a great family to maintain."\r\n\r\nPoor Clara! what had the great family done for her, or how had she\r\nbeen taught to maintain its honour? She knew that she was an earl\'s\r\ndaughter, and that people called her Lady Clara; whereas other young\r\nladies were only called Miss So-and-So. But she had not been taught\r\nto separate herself from the ordinary throng of young ladies by any\r\nother distinction. Her great family had done nothing special for her,\r\nnor placed before her for example any grandly noble deeds. At that\r\nold house at Desmond Court company was scarce, money was scarce,\r\nservants were scarce. She had been confided to the care of a very\r\nordinary governess; and if there was about her anything that was\r\ngreat or good, it was intrinsically her own, and by no means due to\r\nintrinsic advantages derived from her grand family. Why should she\r\nnot give what was so entirely her own to one whom she loved, to one\r\nby whom it so pleased her to be loved?\r\n\r\nAnd then they entered the house, and Clara followed her mother to the\r\ncountess\'s own small up-stairs sitting-room. The daughter did not\r\nordinarily share this room with her mother, and when she entered it,\r\nshe seldom did so with pleasurable emotion. At the present moment she\r\nhad hardly strength to close the door after her.\r\n\r\n"And now, Clara, what is all this?" said the countess, sitting down\r\nin her accustomed chair.\r\n\r\n"All which, mamma?" Can any one blame her in that she so far\r\nequivocated?\r\n\r\n"Clara, you know very well what I mean. What has there been between\r\nyou and Mr. Fitzgerald?"\r\n\r\nThe guilt-stricken wretch sat silent for a while, sustaining the\r\nscrutiny of her mother\'s gaze; and then falling from her chair on to\r\nher knees, she hid her face in her mother\'s lap, exclaiming, "Oh,\r\nmamma, mamma, do not look at me like that!"\r\n\r\nLady Desmond\'s heart was somewhat softened by this appeal; nor would\r\nI have it thought that she was a cruel woman, or an unnatural mother.\r\nIt had not been her lot to make an absolute, dearest, heartiest\r\nfriend of her daughter, as some mothers do; a friend between whom\r\nand herself there should be, nay could be, no secrets. She could not\r\nbecome young again in sharing the romance of her daughter\'s love, in\r\nenjoying the gaieties of her daughter\'s balls, in planning dresses,\r\namusements, and triumphs with her child. Some mothers can do this;\r\nand they, I think, are the mothers who enjoy most fully the delights\r\nof maternity. This was not the case with Lady Desmond; but yet she\r\nloved her child, and would have made any reasonable sacrifice for\r\nwhat she regarded as that child\'s welfare.\r\n\r\n"But, my dear," she said, in a softened tone, "you must tell me what\r\nhas occurred. Do you not know that it is my duty to ask, and yours\r\nto tell me? It cannot be right that there should be any secret\r\nunderstanding between yourself and Mr. Fitzgerald. You know that,\r\nClara, do you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma," said Clara, remembering that her lover had bade her\r\ntell her mother everything.\r\n\r\n"Well, my love?"\r\n\r\nClara\'s story was very simple, and did not, in fact, want any\r\ntelling. It was merely the old well-worn tale, so common through all\r\nthe world. "He had laughed on the lass with his bonny black eye!"\r\nand she,--she was ready to go "to the mountain to hear a love-tale!"\r\nOne may say that an occurrence so very common could not want much\r\ntelling.\r\n\r\n"Mamma; he says--"\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear?"\r\n\r\n"He says--. Oh, mamma! I could not help it."\r\n\r\n"No, Clara; you certainly could not help what he might say to you.\r\nYou could not refuse to listen to him. A lady in such a case, when\r\nshe is on terms of intimacy with a gentleman, as you were with Mr.\r\nFitzgerald, is bound to listen to him, and to give him an answer. You\r\ncould not help what he might say, Clara. The question now is, what\r\nanswer did you give to what he said?"\r\n\r\nClara, who was still kneeling, looked up piteously into her mother\'s\r\nface, sighed bitterly, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n"He told you that he loved you, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose you gave him some answer? Eh! my dear?"\r\n\r\nThe answer to this was another long sigh.\r\n\r\n"But, Clara, you must tell me. It is absolutely necessary that I\r\nshould know whether you have given him any hope, and if so, how much.\r\nOf course the whole thing must be stopped at once. Young as you are,\r\nyou cannot think that a marriage with Mr. Owen Fitzgerald would be a\r\nproper match for you to make. Of course the whole thing must cease\r\nat once--at once." Here there was another piteous sigh. "But before\r\nI take any steps, I must know what you have said to him. Surely you\r\nhave not told him that you have any feeling for him warmer than\r\nordinary regard?"\r\n\r\nLady Desmond knew what she was doing very well. She was perfectly\r\nsure that her daughter had pledged her troth to Owen Fitzgerald.\r\nIndeed, if she made any mistake in the matter, it was in thinking\r\nthat Clara had given a more absolute assurance of love than had in\r\ntruth been extracted from her. But she calculated, and calculated\r\nwisely, that the surest way of talking her daughter out of all hope,\r\nwas to express herself as unable to believe that a child of hers\r\nwould own to love for one so much beneath her, and to speak of such\r\na marriage as a thing absolutely impossible. Her method of acting\r\nin this manner had the effect which she desired. The poor girl was\r\nutterly frightened, and began to fear that she had disgraced herself,\r\nthough she knew that she dearly loved the man of whom her mother\r\nspoke so slightingly.\r\n\r\n"Have you given him any promise, Clara?"\r\n\r\n"Not a promise, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Not a promise! What then? Have you professed any regard for him?"\r\nBut upon this Clara was again silent.\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose I must believe that you have professed a regard for\r\nhim--that you have promised to love him?"\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; I have not promised anything. But when he asked me, I--I\r\ndidn\'t--I didn\'t refuse him."\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that Lady Desmond never once asked her daughter\r\nwhat were her feelings. It never occurred to her to inquire, even\r\nwithin her own heart, as to what might be most conducive to her\r\nchild\'s happiness. She meant to do her duty by Clara, and therefore\r\nresolved at once to put a stop to the whole affair. She now desisted\r\nfrom her interrogatories, and sitting silent for a while, looked out\r\ninto the extent of flat ground before the house. Poor Clara the while\r\nsat silent also, awaiting her doom.\r\n\r\n"Clara," said the mother at last, "all this must of course be made to\r\ncease. You are very young, very young indeed, and therefore I do not\r\nblame you. The fault is with him--with him entirely."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma."\r\n\r\n"But I say it is. He has behaved very badly, and has betrayed the\r\ntrust which was placed in him when he was admitted here so intimately\r\nas Patrick\'s friend."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he has not intended to betray any trust," said Clara,\r\nthrough her sobs. The conviction was beginning to come upon her that\r\nshe would be forced to give up her lover; but she could not bring\r\nherself to hear so much evil spoken of him.\r\n\r\n"He has not behaved like a gentleman," continued the countess,\r\nlooking very stern. "And his visits here must of course be altogether\r\ndiscontinued. I am sorry on your brother\'s account, for Patrick was\r\nvery fond of him--"\r\n\r\n"Not half so fond as I am," thought Clara to herself. But she did not\r\ndare to speak her thoughts out loud.\r\n\r\n"But I am quite sure that your brother, young as he is, will not\r\ncontinue to associate with a friend who has thought so slightly of\r\nhis sister\'s honour. Of course I shall let Mr. Fitzgerald know that\r\nhe can come here no more; and all I want from you is a promise that\r\nyou will on no account see him again, or hold any correspondence with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nThat was all she wanted. But Clara, timid as she was, hesitated\r\nbefore she could give a promise so totally at variance with the\r\npledge which she felt that she had given, hardly an hour since, to\r\nFitzgerald. She knew and acknowledged to herself that she had given\r\nhim a pledge, although she had given it in silence. How then was she\r\nto give this other pledge to her mother?\r\n\r\n"You do not mean to say that you hesitate?" said Lady Desmond,\r\nlooking as though she were thunderstruck at the existence of such\r\nhesitation. "You do not wish me to suppose that you intend to\r\npersevere in such insanity? Clara, I must have from you a distinct\r\npromise,--or--"\r\n\r\nWhat might be the dreadful alternative the countess did not at that\r\nminute say. She perhaps thought that her countenance might be more\r\neffective than her speech, and in thinking so she was probably right.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Clara Desmond was as yet only seventeen,\r\nand that she was young even for that age. It must be remembered also,\r\nthat she knew nothing of the world\'s ways, of her own privileges as\r\na creature with a soul and heart of her own, or of what might be\r\nthe true extent of her mother\'s rights over her. She had not in her\r\nenough of matured thought to teach her to say that she would make no\r\npromise that should bind her for ever; but that for the present, in\r\nher present state, she would obey her mother\'s orders. And thus the\r\npromise was exacted and given.\r\n\r\n"If I find you deceiving me, Clara," said the countess, "I will never\r\nforgive you."\r\n\r\nHitherto, Lady Desmond may probably have played her part well;--well,\r\nconsidering her object. But she played it very badly in showing that\r\nshe thought it possible that her daughter should play her false. It\r\nwas now Clara\'s turn to be proud and indignant.\r\n\r\n"Mamma!" she said, holding her head high, and looking at her mother\r\nboldly through her tears, "I have never deceived you yet."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear. I will take steps to prevent his intruding on\r\nyou any further. There may be an end of the matter now. I have no\r\ndoubt that he has endeavoured to use his influence with Patrick; but\r\nI will tell your brother not to speak of the matter further." And so\r\nsaying, she dismissed her daughter.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the earl came in, and there was a conference\r\nbetween him and his mother. Though they were both agreed on the\r\nsubject, though both were decided that it would not do for Clara to\r\nthrow herself away on a county Cork squire with eight hundred a year,\r\na cadet in his family, and a man likely to rise to nothing, still the\r\nearl would not hear him abused.\r\n\r\n"But, Patrick, he must not come here any more," said the countess.\r\n\r\n"Well, I suppose not. But it will be very dull, I know that. I wish\r\nClara hadn\'t made herself such an ass;" and then the boy went away,\r\nand talked kindly over the matter to his poor sister.\r\n\r\nBut the countess had another task still before her. She must make\r\nknown the family resolution to Owen Fitzgerald. When her children\r\nhad left her, one after the other, she sat at the window for an hour,\r\nlooking at nothing, but turning over her own thoughts in her mind.\r\nHitherto she had expressed herself as being very angry with her\r\ndaughter\'s lover; so angry that she had said that he was faithless,\r\na traitor, and no gentleman. She had called him a dissipated\r\nspendthrift, and had threatened his future wife, if ever he should\r\nhave one, with every kind of misery that could fall to a woman\'s lot;\r\nbut now she began to think of him perhaps more kindly.\r\n\r\nShe had been very angry with him;--and the more so because she had\r\nsuch cause to be angry with herself;--with her own lack of judgment,\r\nher own ignorance of the man\'s character, her own folly with\r\nreference to her daughter. She had never asked herself whether she\r\nloved Fitzgerald--had never done so till now. But now she knew that\r\nthe sharpest blow she had received that day was the assurance that he\r\nwas indifferent to herself.\r\n\r\nShe had never thought herself too old to be on an equality with\r\nhim,--on such an equality in point of age as men and women feel when\r\nthey learn to love each other; and therefore it had not occurred to\r\nher that he could regard her daughter as other than a child. To Lady\r\nDesmond, Clara was a child; how then could she be more to him? And\r\nyet now it was too plain that he had looked on Clara as a woman. In\r\nwhat light then must he have thought of that woman\'s mother? And so,\r\nwith saddened heart, but subdued anger, she continued to gaze through\r\nthe window till all without was dusk and dark.\r\n\r\nThere can be to a woman no remembrance of age so strong as that of\r\nseeing a daughter go forth to the world a married woman. If that does\r\nnot tell the mother that the time of her own youth has passed away,\r\nnothing will ever bring the tale home. It had not quite come to this\r\nwith Lady Desmond;--Clara was not going forth to the world as a\r\nmarried woman. But here was one now who had judged her as fit to\r\nbe so taken; and this one was the very man of all others in whose\r\nestimation Lady Desmond would have wished to drop a few of the years\r\nthat encumbered her.\r\n\r\nShe was not, however, a weak woman, and so she performed her task.\r\nShe had candles brought to her, and sitting down, she wrote a note to\r\nOwen Fitzgerald, saying that she herself would call at Hap House at\r\nan hour named on the following day.\r\n\r\nShe had written three or four letters before she had made up her mind\r\nexactly as to the one she would send. At first she had desired him\r\nto come to her there at Desmond Court; but then she thought of the\r\ndanger there might be of Clara seeing him;--of the danger, also, of\r\nher own feelings towards him when he should be there with her, in her\r\nown house, in the accustomed way. And she tried to say by letter all\r\nthat it behoved her to say, so that there need be no meeting. But in\r\nthis she failed. One letter was stern and arrogant, and the next was\r\nsoft-hearted, so that it might teach him to think that his love for\r\nClara might yet be successful. At last she resolved to go herself to\r\nHap House; and accordingly she wrote her letter and despatched it.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald was of course aware of the subject of the threatened\r\nvisit. When he determined to make his proposal to Clara, the matter\r\ndid not seem to him to be one in which all chances of success were\r\ndesperate. If, he thought, he could induce the girl to love him,\r\nother smaller difficulties might be made to vanish from his path.\r\nHe had now induced the girl to own that she did love him; but not\r\nthe less did he begin to see that the difficulties were far from\r\nvanishing. Lady Desmond would never have taken upon herself to make a\r\njourney to Hap House, had not a sentence of absolute banishment from\r\nDesmond Court been passed against him.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald," she began, as soon as she found herself alone with\r\nhim, "you will understand what has induced me to seek you here. After\r\nyour imprudence with Lady Clara Desmond, I could not of course ask\r\nyou to come to Desmond Court."\r\n\r\n"I may have been presumptuous, Lady Desmond, but I do not think that\r\nI have been imprudent. I love your daughter dearly, and I told her\r\nso. Immediately afterwards I told the same to her brother; and she,\r\nno doubt, has told the same to you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she has, Mr. Fitzgerald. Clara, as you are well aware, is a\r\nchild, absolutely a child; much more so than is usual with girls of\r\nher age. The knowledge of this should, I think, have protected her\r\nfrom your advances."\r\n\r\n"But I absolutely deny any such knowledge. And more than that, I\r\nthink that you are greatly mistaken as to her character."\r\n\r\n"Mistaken, sir, as to my own daughter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Lady Desmond; I think you are. I think--"\r\n\r\n"On such a matter, Mr. Fitzgerald, I need not trouble you for an\r\nexpression of your thoughts. Nor need we argue that subject any\r\nfurther. You must of course be aware that all ideas of any such\r\nmarriage as this must be laid aside."\r\n\r\n"On what grounds, Lady Desmond?"\r\n\r\nNow this appeared to the countess to be rather impudent on the part\r\nof the young squire. The reasons why he, Owen Fitzgerald of Hap\r\nHouse, should not marry a daughter of an Earl of Desmond, seemed to\r\nher to be so conspicuous and conclusive, that it could hardly be\r\nnecessary to enumerate them. And such as they were, it might not be\r\npleasant to announce them in his hearing. But though Owen Fitzgerald\r\nwas so evidently an unfit suitor for an earl\'s daughter, it might\r\nstill be possible that he should be acceptable to an earl\'s widow.\r\nAh! if it might be possible to teach him the two lessons at the same\r\ntime!\r\n\r\n"On what grounds, Mr. Fitzgerald!" she said, repeating his question;\r\n"surely I need hardly tell you. Did not my son say the same thing to\r\nyou yesterday, as he walked with you down the avenue?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he told me candidly that he looked higher for his sister; and I\r\nliked him for his candour. But that is no reason that I should agree\r\nwith him; or, which is much more important, that his sister should do\r\nso. If she thinks that she can be happy in such a home as I can give\r\nher, I do not know why he, or why you should object."\r\n\r\n"You think, then, that I might give her to a blacksmith, if she\r\nherself were mad enough to wish it?"\r\n\r\n"I thank you for the compliment, Lady Desmond."\r\n\r\n"You have driven me to it, sir."\r\n\r\n"I believe it is considered in the world," said he,--"that is, in\r\nour country, that the one great difference is between gentlemen\r\nand ladies, and those who are not gentlemen or ladies. A lady does\r\nnot degrade herself if she marry a gentleman, even though that\r\ngentleman\'s rank be less high than her own."\r\n\r\n"It is not a question of degradation, but of prudence;--of the\r\nordinary caution which I, as a mother, am bound to use as regards my\r\ndaughter. Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!" and she now altered her tone as she\r\nspoke to him; "we have all been so pleased to know you, so happy to\r\nhave you there; why have you destroyed all this by one half-hour\'s\r\nfolly?"\r\n\r\n"The folly, as you call it, Lady Desmond, has been premeditated for\r\nthe last twelve months."\r\n\r\n"For twelve months!" said she, taken absolutely by surprise, and in\r\nher surprise believing him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, for twelve months. Ever since I began to know your daughter, I\r\nhave loved her. You say that your daughter is a child. I also thought\r\nso this time last year, in our last winter holidays. I thought so\r\nthen; and though I loved her as a child, I kept it to myself. Now she\r\nis a woman, and so thinking I have spoken to her as one. I have told\r\nher that I loved her, as I now tell you that come what may I must\r\ncontinue to do so. Had she made me believe that I was indifferent to\r\nher, absence, perhaps, and distance might have taught me to forget\r\nher. But such, I think, is not the case."\r\n\r\n"And you must forget her now."\r\n\r\n"Never, Lady Desmond."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, sir. A child that does not know her own mind, that thinks\r\nof a lover as she does of some new toy, whose first appearance in the\r\nworld was only made the other night at your cousin\'s house! you ought\r\nto feel ashamed of such a passion, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"I am very far from being ashamed of it, Lady Desmond."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, let me tell you this. My daughter has promised me\r\nmost solemnly that she will neither see you again, nor have any\r\ncorrespondence with you. And this I know of her, that her word is\r\nsacred. I can excuse her on account of her youth; and, young as\r\nshe is, she already sees her own folly in having allowed you so to\r\naddress her. But for you, Mr. Fitzgerald, under all the circumstances\r\nI can make no excuse for you. Is yours, do you think, the sort of\r\nhouse to which a young girl should be brought as a bride? Is your\r\nlife, are your companions of that kind which could most profit her? I\r\nam sorry that you drive me to remind you of these things."\r\n\r\nHis face became very dark, and his brow stern as his sins were thus\r\ncast into his teeth.\r\n\r\n"And from what you know of me, Lady Desmond," he said,--and as he\r\nspoke he assumed a dignity of demeanour which made her more inclined\r\nto love him than ever she had been before,--"do you think that I\r\nshould be the man to introduce a young wife to such companions as\r\nthose to whom you allude? Do you not know, are you not sure in your\r\nown heart, that my marriage with your daughter would instantly put an\r\nend to all that?"\r\n\r\n"Whatever may be my own thoughts, and they are not likely to be\r\nunfavourable to you--for Patrick\'s sake, I mean; but whatever may\r\nbe my own thoughts, I will not subject my daughter to such a risk.\r\nAnd, Mr. Fitzgerald, you must allow me to say, that your income\r\nis altogether insufficient for her wants and your own. She has no\r\nfortune--"\r\n\r\n"I want none with her."\r\n\r\n"And--but I will not argue the matter with you. I did not come to\r\nargue it, but to tell you, with as little offence as may be possible,\r\nthat such a marriage is absolutely impossible. My daughter herself\r\nhas already abandoned all thoughts of it."\r\n\r\n"Her thoughts then must be wonderfully under her own control. Much\r\nmore so than mine are."\r\n\r\n"Lord Desmond, you may be sure, will not hear of it."\r\n\r\n"Lord Desmond cannot at present be less of a child than his sister."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"At any rate, Lady Desmond, I will not put my happiness, nor as far\r\nas I am concerned in it, his sister\'s happiness, at his disposal.\r\nWhen I told her that I loved her, I did not speak, as you seem to\r\nthink, from an impulse of the moment. I spoke because I loved her;\r\nand as I love her, I shall of course try to win her. Nothing can\r\nabsolve me from my engagement to her but her marriage with another\r\nperson."\r\n\r\nThe countess had once or twice made small efforts to come to terms of\r\npeace with him; or rather to a truce, under which there might still\r\nbe some friendship between them,--accompanied, however, by a positive\r\ncondition that Clara should be omitted from any participation in it.\r\nShe would have been willing to say, "Let all this be forgotten, only\r\nfor some time to come you and Clara cannot meet each other." But\r\nFitzgerald would by no means agree to such terms; and the countess\r\nwas obliged to leave his house, having in effect only thrown down a\r\ngauntlet of battle; having in vain attempted to extend over it an\r\nolive-branch of peace.\r\n\r\nHe helped her, however, into her little pony carriage, and at parting\r\nshe gave him her hand. He just touched it, and then, taking off his\r\nhat, bowed courteously to her as she drove from his door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE FITZGERALDS OF CASTLE RICHMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat idea of carrying out his plans may have been prevalent in\r\nFitzgerald\'s mind when he was so defiant of the countess, it may be\r\ndifficult to say. Probably he had no idea, but felt at the spur of\r\nthe moment that it would be weak to yield. The consequence was, that\r\nwhen Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself\r\nas being at feud with the family.\r\n\r\nThe young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even\r\nentertained him at Hap House; but the earl\'s pride would not give way\r\nan inch.\r\n\r\n"Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it. It\r\nwould be a bad match for my sister, and so you\'d feel if you were in\r\nmy place." And then Lord Desmond went back to Eton.\r\n\r\nAfter that they none of them met for many months. During this time\r\nlife went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond\r\nfelt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness\r\nto Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment\r\nhad driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she\r\nnot only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she\r\nreturned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen\r\nhad caused to be conveyed to her hand. It was not that she had ceased\r\nto love him, but she had high ideas of truth and honour, and would\r\nnot break her word. Perhaps she was sustained in her misery by the\r\nremembrance that heroines are always miserable.\r\n\r\nAnd then the orgies at Hap House became hotter and faster. Hitherto\r\nthere had perhaps been more smoke than fire, more calumny than sin.\r\nAnd Fitzgerald, when he had intimated that the presence of a young\r\nwife would save him from it all, had not boasted falsely. But now\r\nthat his friends had turned their backs upon him, that he was\r\nbanished from Desmond Court, and twitted with his iniquities at\r\nCastle Richmond, he threw off all restraint, and endeavoured to enjoy\r\nhimself in his own way. So the orgies became fast and furious; all\r\nwhich of course reached the ears of poor Clara Desmond.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer holidays, Lord Desmond was not at home, but Owen\r\nFitzgerald was also away. He had gone abroad, perhaps with the\r\nconviction that it would be well that he and the Desmonds should not\r\nmeet; and he remained abroad till the hunting season again commenced.\r\nThen the winter came again, and he and Lord Desmond used to meet in\r\nthe field. There they would exchange courtesies, and, to a certain\r\ndegree, show that they were intimate. But all the world knew that the\r\nold friendship was over. And, indeed, all the world--all the county\r\nCork world--soon knew the reason. And so we are brought down to the\r\nperiod at which our story was to begin.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto said little or nothing of Castle Richmond and its\r\ninhabitants; but it is now time that we should do so, and we will\r\nbegin with the heir of the family. At the period of which we are\r\nspeaking, Herbert Fitzgerald had just returned from Oxford, having\r\ncompleted his affairs there in a manner very much to the satisfaction\r\nof his father, mother, and sisters; and to the unqualified admiration\r\nof his aunt, Miss Letty. I am not aware that the heads of colleges,\r\nand supreme synod of Dons had signified by any general expression of\r\nsentiment, that Herbert Fitzgerald had so conducted himself as to\r\nbe a standing honour and perpetual glory to the University; but at\r\nCastle Richmond it was all the same as though they had done so. There\r\nare some kindly-hearted, soft-minded parents, in whose estimation\r\nnot to have fallen into disgrace shows the highest merit on the part\r\nof their children. Herbert had not been rusticated; had not got\r\ninto debt, at least not to an extent that had been offensive to\r\nhis father\'s pocket; he had not been plucked. Indeed, he had taken\r\nhonours, in some low unnoticed degree;--unnoticed, that is, at\r\nOxford; but noticed at Castle Richmond by an ovation--almost by a\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nBut Herbert Fitzgerald was a son to gladden a father\'s heart and a\r\nmother\'s eye. He was not handsome, as was his cousin Owen; not tall\r\nand stalwart and godlike in his proportions, as was the reveller\r\nof Hap House; but nevertheless, and perhaps not the less, was he\r\npleasant to look on. He was smaller and darker than his cousin; but\r\nhis eyes were bright and full of good humour. He was clean looking\r\nand clean made; pleasant and courteous in all his habits; attached\r\nto books in a moderate, easy way, but no bookworm; he had a gentle\r\naffection for bindings and title-pages; was fond of pictures, of\r\nwhich it might be probable that he would some day know more than\r\nhe did at present; addicted to Gothic architecture, and already\r\nproprietor of the germ of what was to be a collection of coins.\r\n\r\nOwen Fitzgerald had called him a prig; but Herbert was no prig. Nor\r\nyet was he a pedant; which word might, perhaps, more nearly have\r\nexpressed his cousin\'s meaning. He liked little bits of learning,\r\nthe easy outsides and tags of classical acquirements, which come so\r\neasily within the scope of the memory when a man has passed some ten\r\nyears between a public school and a university. But though he did\r\nlove to chew the cud of these morsels of Attic grass which he had\r\ncropped, certainly without any great or sustained effort, he had no\r\ndesire to be ostentatious in doing so, or to show off more than he\r\nknew. Indeed, now that he was away from his college friends, he was\r\nrather ashamed of himself than otherwise when scraps of quotations\r\nwould break forth from him in his own despite. Looking at his true\r\ncharacter, it was certainly unjust to call him either a prig or a\r\npedant.\r\n\r\nHe was fond of the society of ladies, and was a great favourite with\r\nhis sisters, who thought that every girl who saw him must instantly\r\nfall in love with him. He was goodnatured, and, as the only son of a\r\nrich man, was generally well provided with money. Such a brother is\r\nusually a favourite with his sisters. He was a great favourite too\r\nwith his aunt, whose heart, however, was daily sinking into her shoes\r\nthrough the effect of one great terror which harassed her respecting\r\nhim. She feared that he had become a Puseyite. Now that means much\r\nwith some ladies in England; but with most ladies of the Protestant\r\nreligion in Ireland, it means, one may almost say, the very Father of\r\nMischief himself. In their minds, the pope, with his lady of Babylon,\r\nhis college of cardinals, and all his community of pinchbeck saints,\r\nholds a sort of second head-quarters of his own at Oxford. And there\r\nhis high priest is supposed to be one wicked infamous Pusey, and his\r\nworshippers are wicked infamous Puseyites. Now, Miss Letty Fitzgerald\r\nwas strong on this subject, and little inklings had fallen from her\r\nnephew which robbed her of much of her peace of mind.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that these volumes should be graced by any hero,\r\nfor the story does not admit of one. But if there were to be a hero,\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald would be the man.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Fitzgerald at this period was an old man in appearance,\r\nthough by no means an old man in years, being hardly more than fifty.\r\nWhy he should have withered away as it were into premature grayness,\r\nand loss of the muscle and energy of life, none knew; unless, indeed,\r\nhis wife did know. But so it was. He had, one may say, all that a\r\nkind fortune could give him. He had a wife who was devoted to him; he\r\nhad a son on whom he doted, and of whom all men said all good things;\r\nhe had two sweet, happy daughters; he had a pleasant house, a fine\r\nestate, position and rank in the world. Had it so pleased him, he\r\nmight have sat in Parliament without any of the trouble, and with\r\nvery little of the expense, which usually attends aspirants for that\r\nhonour. And, as it was, he might hope to see his son in Parliament\r\nwithin a year or two. For among other possessions of the Fitzgerald\r\nfamily was the land on which stands the borough of Kilcommon, a\r\nborough to which the old Reform Bill was merciful, as it was to so\r\nmany others in the south of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, should Sir Thomas Fitzgerald be a silent, melancholy man,\r\nconfining himself for the last year or two almost entirely to his own\r\nstudy; giving up to his steward the care even of his own demesne and\r\nfarm; never going to the houses of his friends, and rarely welcoming\r\nthem to his; rarely as it was, and never as it would have been, had\r\nhe been always allowed to have his own way?\r\n\r\nPeople in the surrounding neighbourhood had begun to say that Sir\r\nThomas\'s sorrow had sprung from shortness of cash, and that money was\r\nnot so easily to be had at Castle Richmond now-a-days as was the case\r\nsome ten years since. If this were so, the dearth of that very useful\r\narticle could not have in any degree arisen from extravagance. It\r\nwas well known that Sir Thomas\'s estate was large, being of a value,\r\naccording to that public and well-authenticated rent-roll which the\r\nneighbours of a rich man always carry in their heads, amounting to\r\ntwelve or fourteen thousand a year. Now Sir Thomas had come into the\r\nunencumbered possession of this at an early age, and had never been\r\nextravagant himself or in his family. His estates were strictly\r\nentailed, and therefore, as he had only a life interest in them,\r\nit of course was necessary that he should save money and insure\r\nhis life, to make provision for his daughters. But by a man of his\r\nhabits and his property, such a burden as this could hardly have been\r\naccounted any burden at all. That he did, however, in this mental\r\nprivacy of his carry some heavy burden, was made plain enough to all\r\nwho knew him.\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Fitzgerald was in many things a counterpart of her husband,\r\nnot in health so much as in spirits. She, also, was old for her age,\r\nand woebegone, not only in appearance, but also in the inner workings\r\nof her heart. But then it was known of her that she had undergone\r\ndeep sorrows in her early youth, which had left their mark upon her\r\nbrow, and their trace upon her inmost thoughts. Sir Thomas had not\r\nbeen her first husband. When very young, she had been married, or\r\nrather, given in marriage, to a man who in a very few weeks after\r\nthat ill-fated union had shown himself to be perfectly unworthy of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHer story, or so much of it as was known to her friends, was this.\r\nHer father had been a clergyman in Dorsetshire, burdened with a small\r\nincome, and blessed with a large family. She who afterwards became\r\nLady Fitzgerald was his eldest child; and, as Miss Wainwright--Mary\r\nWainwright--had grown up to be the possessor of almost perfect female\r\nloveliness. While she was yet very young, a widower with an only boy,\r\na man who at that time was considerably less than thirty, had come\r\ninto her father\'s parish, having rented there a small hunting-box.\r\nThis gentleman--we will so call him, in lack of some other\r\nterm--immediately became possessed of an establishment, at any rate\r\neminently respectable. He had three hunters, two grooms, and a gig;\r\nand on Sundays went to church with a prayer-book in his hand, and\r\na black coat on his back. What more could be desired to prove his\r\nrespectability?\r\n\r\nHe had not been there a month before he was intimate in the parson\'s\r\nhouse. Before two months had passed he was engaged to the parson\'s\r\ndaughter. Before the full quarter had flown by, he and the parson\'s\r\ndaughter were man and wife; and in five months from the time of his\r\nfirst appearance in the Dorsetshire parish, he had flown from his\r\ncreditors, leaving behind him his three horses, his two grooms, his\r\ngig, his wife, and his little boy.\r\n\r\nThe Dorsetshire neighbours, and especially the Dorsetshire ladies,\r\nhad at first been loud in their envious exclamations as to Miss\r\nWainwright\'s luck. The parson and the parson\'s wife, and poor Mary\r\nWainwright herself, had, according to the sayings of that moment\r\nprevalent in the county, used most unjustifiable wiles in trapping\r\nthis poor rich stranger. Miss Wainwright, as they all declared, had\r\nnot clothes to her back when she went to him. The matter had been got\r\nup and managed in most indecent hurry, so as to rob the poor fellow\r\nof any chance of escape. And thus all manner of evil things were\r\nsaid, in which envy of the bride and pity of the bridegroom were\r\nequally commingled.\r\n\r\nBut when the sudden news came that Mr. Talbot had bolted, and when\r\nafter a week\'s inquiry no one could tell whither Mr. Talbot had gone,\r\nthe objurgations of the neighbours were expressed in a different\r\ntone. Then it was declared that Mr. Wainwright had sacrificed his\r\nbeautiful child without making any inquiry as to the character of\r\nthe stranger to whom he had so recklessly given her. The pity of the\r\ncounty fell to the share of the poor beautiful girl, whose welfare\r\nand happiness were absolutely ruined; and the parson was pulled to\r\npieces for his sordid parsimony in having endeavoured to rid himself\r\nin so disgraceful a manner of the charge of one of his children.\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond the scope of my story to tell here of the anxious\r\nfamily councils which were held in that parsonage parlour, during the\r\ntime of that daughter\'s courtship. There had been misgivings as to\r\nthe stability of the wooer; there had been an anxious wish not to\r\nlose for the penniless daughter the advantage of a wealthy match;\r\nthe poor girl herself had been much cross-questioned as to her own\r\nfeelings. But let them have been right, or let them have been wrong\r\nat that parsonage, the matter was settled, very speedily as we have\r\nseen; and Mary Wainwright became Mrs. Talbot when she was still\r\nalmost a child.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Talbot bolted; and it became known to the Dorsetshire\r\nworld that he had not paid a shilling for rent, or for butcher\'s meat\r\nfor his human family, or for oats for his equine family, during the\r\nwhole period of his sojourn at Chevy-chase Lodge. Grand references\r\nhad been made to a London banker, which had been answered by\r\nassurances that Mr. Talbot was as good as the Bank of England. But\r\nit turned out that the assurances were forged, and that the letter\r\nof inquiry addressed to the London banker had been intercepted. In\r\nshort, it was all ruin, roguery, and wretchedness.\r\n\r\nAnd very wretched they all were, the old father, the young bride, and\r\nall that parsonage household. After much inquiry something at last\r\nwas discovered. The man had a sister whose whereabouts was made out;\r\nand she consented to receive the child--on condition that the bairn\r\nshould not come to her empty-handed. In order to get rid of this\r\nburden, Mr. Wainwright with great difficulty made up thirty pounds.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was discovered that the man\'s name was not Talbot.\r\nWhat it was did not become known in Dorsetshire, for the poor wife\r\nresumed her maiden name--with very little right to do so, as her kind\r\nneighbours observed--till fortune so kindly gave her the privilege of\r\nbearing another honourably before the world.\r\n\r\nAnd then other inquiries, and almost endless search was made with\r\nreference to that miscreant--not quite immediately--for at the moment\r\nof the blow such search seemed to be but of little use; but after\r\nsome months, when the first stupor arising from their grief had\r\npassed away, and when they once more began to find that the fields\r\nwere still green, and the sun warm, and that God\'s goodness was not\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nAnd the search was made not so much with reference to him as to his\r\nfate, for tidings had reached the parsonage that he was no more. The\r\nperiod was that in which Paris was occupied by the allied forces,\r\nwhen our general, the Duke of Wellington, was paramount in the French\r\ncapital, and the Tuileries and Champs Elys\xe9es were swarming with\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nReport at the time was brought home that the soi-disant Talbot,\r\nfighting his battles under the name of Chichester, had been seen and\r\nnoted in the gambling-houses of Paris; that he had been forcibly\r\nextruded from some such chamber for non-payment of a gambling debt;\r\nthat he had made one in a violent fracas which had subsequently taken\r\nplace in the French streets; and that his body had afterwards been\r\nidentified in the Morgue.\r\n\r\nSuch was the story which bit by bit reached Mr. Wainwright\'s ears,\r\nand at last induced him to go over to Paris, so that the absolute and\r\nproof-sustained truth of the matter might be ascertained, and made\r\nknown to all men. The poor man\'s search was difficult and weary. The\r\nways of Paris were not then so easy to an Englishman as they have\r\nsince become, and Mr. Wainwright could not himself speak a word of\r\nFrench. But nevertheless he did learn much; so much as to justify\r\nhim, as he thought, in instructing his daughter to wear a widow\'s\r\ncap. That Talbot had been kicked out of a gambling-house in the Rue\r\nRichelieu was absolutely proved. An acquaintance who had been with\r\nhim in Dorsetshire on his first arrival there had seen this done;\r\nand bore testimony of the fact that the man so treated was the man\r\nwho had taken the hunting-lodge in England. This same acquaintance\r\nhad been one of the party adverse to Talbot in the row which had\r\nfollowed, and he could not, therefore, be got to say that he had\r\nseen him dead. But other evidence had gone to show that the man who\r\nhad been so extruded was the man who had perished; and the French\r\nlawyer whom Mr. Wainwright had employed, at last assured the poor\r\nbroken-hearted clergyman that he might look upon it as proved. "Had\r\nhe not been dead," said the lawyer, "the inquiry which has been\r\nmade would have traced him out alive." And thus his daughter was\r\ninstructed to put on her widow\'s cap, and her mother again called her\r\nMrs. Talbot.\r\n\r\nIndeed, at that time they hardly knew what to call her, or how to act\r\nin the wisest and most befitting manner. Among those who had truly\r\nfelt for them in their misfortunes, who had really pitied them and\r\nencountered them with loving sympathy, the kindest and most valued\r\nfriend had been the vicar of a neighbouring parish. He himself was\r\na widower without children; but living with him at that time, and\r\nreading with him, was a young gentleman whose father was just dead,\r\na baronet of large property, and an Irishman. This was Sir Thomas\r\nFitzgerald.\r\n\r\nIt need not now be told how this young man\'s sympathies were also\r\nexcited, or how sympathy had grown into love. In telling our tale\r\nwe fain would not dwell much on the cradledom of our Meleager. The\r\nyoung widow in her widow\'s cap grew to be more lovely than she\r\nhad ever been before her miscreant husband had seen her. They who\r\nremembered her in those days told wondrous tales of her surprising\r\nloveliness;--how men from London would come down to see her in the\r\nparish church; how she was talked of as the Dorsetshire Venus, only\r\nthat unlike Venus she would give a hearing to no man; how sad she was\r\nas well as lovely; and how impossible it was found to win a smile\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nBut though she could not smile, she could love; and at last she\r\naccepted the love of the young baronet. And then the father, who had\r\nso grossly neglected his duty when he gave her in marriage to an\r\nunknown rascally adventurer, endeavoured to atone for such neglect\r\nby the severest caution with reference to this new suitor. Further\r\ninquiries were made. Sir Thomas went over to Paris himself with that\r\nother clergyman. Lawyers were employed in England to sift out the\r\ntruth; and at last, by the united agreement of some dozen men, all\r\nof whom were known to be worthy, it was decided that Talbot was dead,\r\nand that his widow was free to choose another mate. Another mate she\r\nhad already chosen, and immediately after this she was married to Sir\r\nThomas Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nSuch was the early life-story of Lady Fitzgerald; and as this was\r\nwidely known to those who lived around her--for how could such a\r\nlife-story as that remain untold?--no one wondered why she should\r\nbe gentle and silent in her life\'s course. That she had been an\r\nexcellent wife, a kind and careful mother, a loving neighbour to\r\nthe poor, and courteous neighbour to the rich, all the county\r\nCork admitted. She had lived down envy by her gentleness and soft\r\nhumility, and every one spoke of her and her retiring habits with\r\nsympathy and reverence.\r\n\r\nBut why should her husband also be so sad--nay, so much sadder?\r\nFor Lady Fitzgerald, though she was gentle and silent, was not\r\na sorrowful woman--otherwise than she was made so by seeing her\r\nhusband\'s sorrow. She had been to him a loving partner, and no man\r\ncould more tenderly have returned a wife\'s love than he had done.\r\nOne would say that all had run smoothly at Castle Richmond since the\r\nhouse had been made happy, after some years of waiting, by the birth\r\nof an eldest child and heir. But, nevertheless, those who knew most\r\nof Sir Thomas saw that there was a peacock on the wall.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to say further a word or two as to the other\r\nladies of the family, and hardly necessary to say that. Mary and\r\nEmmeline Fitzgerald were both cheerful girls. I do not mean that they\r\nwere boisterous laughers, that in waltzing they would tear round a\r\nroom like human steam-engines, that they rode well to hounds as some\r\nyoung ladies now-a-days do--and some young ladies do ride very well\r\nto hounds; nor that they affected slang, and decked their persons\r\nwith odds and ends of masculine costume. In saying that they were\r\ncheerful, I by no means wish it to be understood that they were loud.\r\n\r\nThey were pretty, too, but neither of them lovely, as their mother\r\nhad been--hardly, indeed, so lovely as that pale mother was now,\r\neven in these latter days. Ah, how very lovely that pale mother was,\r\nas she sat still and silent in her own place on the small sofa by\r\nthe slight, small table which she used! Her hair was gray, and her\r\neyes sunken, and her lips thin and bloodless; but yet never shall I\r\nsee her equal for pure feminine beauty, for form and outline, for\r\npassionless grace, and sweet, gentle, womanly softness. All her sad\r\ntale was written upon her brow; all its sadness and all its poetry.\r\nOne could read there the fearful, all but fatal danger to which her\r\nchildhood had been exposed, and the daily thanks with which she\r\npraised her God for having spared and saved her.\r\n\r\nBut I am running back to the mother in attempting to say a word\r\nabout her children. Of the two, Emmeline, the younger, was the more\r\nlike her; but no one who was a judge of outline could imagine that\r\nEmmeline, at her mother\'s age, would ever have her mother\'s beauty.\r\nNevertheless, they were fine, handsome girls, more popular in the\r\nneighbourhood than any of their neighbours, well educated, sensible,\r\nfeminine, and useful; fitted to be the wives of good men.\r\n\r\nAnd what shall I say of Miss Letty? She was ten years older than her\r\nbrother, and as strong as a horse. She was great at walking, and\r\nrecommended that exercise strongly to all young ladies as an antidote\r\nto every ill, from love to chilblains. She was short and dapper in\r\nperson; not ugly, excepting that her nose was long, and had a little\r\nbump or excrescence at the end of it. She always wore a bonnet, even\r\nat meal times; and was supposed by those who were not intimately\r\nacquainted with the mysteries of her toilet, to sleep in it; often,\r\nindeed, she did sleep in it, and gave unmusical evidence of her doing\r\nso. She was not illnatured; but so strongly prejudiced on many points\r\nas to be equally disagreeable as though she were so. With her, as\r\nwith the world in general, religion was the point on which those\r\nprejudices were the strongest; and the peculiar bent they took was\r\nhorror and hatred of popery. As she lived in a country in which the\r\nRoman Catholic was the religion of all the poorer classes, and of\r\nvery many persons who were not poor, there was ample scope in which\r\nher horror and hatred could work. She was charitable to a fault, and\r\nwould exercise that charity for the good of Papists as willingly as\r\nfor the good of Protestants; but in doing so she always remembered\r\nthe good cause. She always clogged the flannel petticoat with some\r\nProtestant teaching, or burdened the little coat and trousers with\r\nthe pains and penalties of idolatry.\r\n\r\nWhen her brother had married the widow Talbot, her anger with him\r\nand her hatred towards her sister-in-law had been extreme. But time\r\nand conviction had worked in her so thorough a change, that she now\r\nalmost worshipped the very spot in which Lady Fitzgerald habitually\r\nsat. She had the faculty to know and recognize goodness when she saw\r\nit, and she had known and recognized it in her brother\'s wife.\r\n\r\nHim also, her brother himself, she warmly loved and greatly\r\nreverenced. She deeply grieved over his state of body and mind, and\r\nwould have given all she ever had, even her very self, to restore him\r\nto health and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe three children of course she loved, and petted, and scolded;\r\nand as children bothered them out of all their peace and quietness.\r\nTo the girls she was still almost as great a torment as in their\r\nchildish days. Nevertheless, they still loved, and sometimes obeyed\r\nher. Of Herbert she stood somewhat more in awe. He was the future\r\nhead of the family, and already a Bachelor of Arts. In a very few\r\nyears he would probably assume the higher title of a married man of\r\narts, she thought; and perhaps the less formidable one of a member of\r\nParliament also. Him, therefore, she treated with deference. But,\r\nalas! what if he should become a Puseyite!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE KANTURK HOTEL, SOUTH MAIN STREET, CORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the world no doubt knows South Main Street in the city of Cork.\r\nIn the "ould" ancient days, South and North Main Streets formed the\r\nchief thoroughfare through the city, and hence of course they derived\r\ntheir names. But now, since Patrick Street, and Grand Parade, and the\r\nSouth Mall have grown up, Main Street has but little honour. It is\r\ncrowded with second-rate tobacconists and third-rate grocers; the\r\nhouses are dirty, and the street is narrow; fashionable ladies never\r\nvisit it for their shopping, nor would any respectable commercial\r\ngent stop at an inn within its purlieus.\r\n\r\nBut here in South Main Street, at the time of which I am writing,\r\nthere was an inn, or public-house, called the Kanturk Hotel. In dear\r\nold Ireland they have some foibles, and one of them is a passion\r\nfor high nomenclature. Those who are accustomed to the sort of\r\nestablishments which are met with in England, and much more in\r\nGermany and Switzerland, under the name of hotels, might be surprised\r\nto see the place in South Main Street which had been dignified with\r\nthe same appellation. It was a small, dingy house of three stories,\r\nthe front door of which was always open, and the passage strewed\r\nwith damp, dirty straw. On the left-hand side as you entered was\r\na sitting-room, or coffee-room as it was announced to be by an\r\nappellation painted on the door. There was but one window to the\r\nroom, which looked into the street, and was always clouded by a\r\ndingy-red curtain. The floor was uncarpeted, nearly black with dirt,\r\nand usually half covered with fragments of damp straw brought into\r\nit by the feet of customers. A strong smell of hot whisky and water\r\nalways prevailed, and the straggling mahogany table in the centre\r\nof the room, whose rickety legs gave way and came off whenever an\r\nattempt was made to move it, was covered by small greasy circles, the\r\nimpressions of the bottoms of tumblers which had been made by the\r\noverflowing tipple. Over the chimney there was a round mirror, the\r\nframework of which was bedizened with all manner of would-be gilt\r\nornaments, which had been cracked, and twisted, and mended till it\r\nwas impossible to know what they had been intended to represent; and\r\nthe whole affair had become a huge receptacle of dust, which fell in\r\nflakes upon the chimney-piece when it was invaded. There was a second\r\ntable opposite the window, more rickety than that in the centre;\r\nand against the wall opposite to the fireplace there was an old\r\nsideboard, in the drawers of which Tom, the one-eyed waiter, kept\r\nknives and forks, and candle-ends, and bits of bread, and dusters.\r\nThere was a sour smell, as of old rancid butter, about the place,\r\nto which the guests sometimes objected, little inclined as they\r\ngenerally were to be fastidious. But this was a tender subject, and\r\nnot often alluded to by those who wished to stand well in the good\r\ngraces of Tom. Many things much annoyed Tom; but nothing annoyed him\r\nso fearfully as any assertion that the air of the Kanturk Hotel was\r\nnot perfectly sweet and wholesome.\r\n\r\nBehind the coffee-room was the bar, from which Fanny O\'Dwyer\r\ndispensed dandies of punch and goes of brandy to her father\'s\r\ncustomers from Kanturk. For at this, as at other similar\r\npublic-houses in Irish towns, the greater part of the custom on\r\nwhich the publican depends came to him from the inhabitants of one\r\nparticular country district. A large four-wheeled vehicle, called\r\na long car, which was drawn by three horses, and travelled over a\r\nmountain road at the rate of four Irish miles an hour, came daily\r\nfrom Kanturk to Cork, and daily returned. This public conveyance\r\nstopped in Cork at the Kanturk Hotel, and was owned by the owner of\r\nthat house, in partnership with a brother in the same trade located\r\nin Kanturk. It was Mr. O\'Dwyer\'s business to look after this concern,\r\nto see to the passengers and the booking, the oats, and hay, and\r\nstabling, while his well-known daughter, the charming Fanny O\'Dwyer,\r\ntook care of the house, and dispensed brandy and whisky to the\r\ncustomers from Kanturk.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, the bar was a much more alluring place than the\r\ncoffee-room, and Fanny O\'Dwyer a more alluring personage than Tom,\r\nthe one-eyed waiter. This Elysium, however, was not open to all\r\ncomers--not even to all comers from Kanturk. Those who had the right\r\nof entry well knew their privilege; and so also did they who had not.\r\nThis sanctum was screened off from the passage by a window, which\r\nopened upwards conveniently, as is customary with bar-windows; but\r\nthe window was blinded inside by a red curtain, so that Fanny\'s\r\nstool near the counter, her father\'s wooden arm-chair, and the old\r\nhorsehair sofa on which favoured guests were wont to sit, were not\r\nvisible to the public at large.\r\n\r\nOf the up-stair portion of this establishment it is not necessary to\r\nsay much. It professed to be an hotel, and accommodation for sleeping\r\nwas to be obtained there; but the well-being of the house depended\r\nbut little on custom of this class.\r\n\r\nNor need I say much of the kitchen, a graphic description of which\r\nwould not be pleasing. Here lived a cook, who, together with Tom\r\nthe waiter, did all that servants had to do at the Kanturk Hotel.\r\nFrom this kitchen lumps of beef, mutton chops, and potatoes did\r\noccasionally emanate, all perfumed with plenteous onions; as also did\r\nfried eggs, with bacon an inch thick, and other culinary messes too\r\nhorrible to be thought of. But drinking rather than eating was the\r\nstaple of this establishment. Such was the Kanturk Hotel in South\r\nMain Street, Cork.\r\n\r\nIt was on a disagreeable, cold, sloppy, raw, winter evening--an\r\nevening drizzling sometimes with rain, and sometimes with sleet--that\r\nan elderly man was driven up to the door of the hotel on a one-horse\r\ncar--or jingle, as such conveniences were then called in the south of\r\nIreland. He seemed to know the house, for with his outside coat all\r\ndripping as it was he went direct to the bar-window, and as Fanny\r\nO\'Dwyer opened the door he walked into that warm precinct. There he\r\nencountered a gentleman, dressed one would say rather beyond the\r\nmerits of the establishment, who was taking his ease at full length\r\non Fanny\'s sofa, and drinking some hot compound which was to be seen\r\nin a tumbler on the chimney-shelf just above his head. It was now six\r\no\'clock in the evening, and the gentleman no doubt had dined.\r\n\r\n"Well, Aby; here I am, as large as life, but as cold as death. Ugh;\r\nwhat an affair that coach is! Fanny, my best of darlings, give me a\r\ndrop of something that\'s best for warming the cockles of an old man\'s\r\nheart."\r\n\r\n"A young wife then is the best thing in life to do that, Mr.\r\nMollett," said Fanny, sharply, preparing, however, at the same time\r\nsome mixture which might be taken more instantaneously.\r\n\r\n"The governor\'s had enough of that receipt already," said the man\r\non the sofa; or rather the man now off the sofa, for he had slowly\r\narisen to shake hands with the new comer.\r\n\r\nThis latter person proceeded to divest himself of his dripping\r\ngreatcoat. "Here, Tom," said he, "bring your old Cyclops eye to bear\r\nthis way, will you. Go and hang that up in the kitchen; not too near\r\nthe fire now; and get me something to eat: none of your mutton chops;\r\nbut a beefsteak if there is such a thing in this benighted place.\r\nWell, Aby, how goes on the war?"\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the elderly gentleman was quite at home in his\r\npresent quarters; for Tom, far from resenting such impertinence, as\r\nhe would immediately have done had it proceeded from an ordinary\r\nKanturk customer, declared "that he would do his honour\'s bidding av\r\nthere was such a thing as a beefsteak to be had anywhere\'s in the\r\ncity of Cork."\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the elderly gentleman was a person of whom one might\r\npremise, judging by his voice and appearance, that he would probably\r\nmake himself at home anywhere. He was a hale hearty man, of perhaps\r\nsixty years of age, who had certainly been handsome, and was even\r\nnow not the reverse. Or rather, one may say, that he would have been\r\nso were it not that there was a low, restless, cunning legible in\r\nhis mouth and eyes, which robbed his countenance of all manliness.\r\nHe was a hale man, and well preserved for his time of life; but\r\nnevertheless, the extra rubicundity of his face, and certain\r\nincipient pimply excrescences about his nose, gave tokens that he\r\nlived too freely. He had lived freely; and were it not that his\r\nconstitution had been more than ordinarily strong, and that constant\r\nexercise and exposure to air had much befriended him, those pimply\r\nexcrescences would have shown themselves in a more advanced stage.\r\nSuch was Mr. Mollett senior--Mr. Matthew Mollett, with whom it will\r\nbe soon our fate to be better acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who had slowly risen from the sofa was his son, Mr.\r\nMollett junior--Mr. Abraham Mollett, with whom also we shall become\r\nbetter acquainted. The father has been represented as not being\r\nexactly prepossessing; but the son, according to my ideas, was much\r\nless so. He also would be considered handsome by some persons--by\r\nwomen chiefly of the Fanny O\'Dwyer class, whose eyes are capable of\r\nrecognizing what is good in shape and form, but cannot recognize\r\nwhat is good in tone and character. Mr. Abraham Mollett was perhaps\r\nsome thirty years of age, or rather more. He was a very smart man,\r\nwith a profusion of dark, much-oiled hair, with dark, copious\r\nmustachoes--and mustachoes being then not common as they are now,\r\nadded to his otherwise rakish, vulgar appearance--with various rings\r\non his not well-washed hands, with a frilled front to his not lately\r\nwashed shirt, with a velvet collar to his coat, and patent-leather\r\nboots upon his feet.\r\n\r\nFree living had told more upon him, young as he was, than upon his\r\nfather. His face was not yet pimply, but it was red and bloated;\r\nhis eyes were bloodshot and protruding; his hand on a morning was\r\nunsteady; and his passion for brandy was stronger than that for\r\nbeefsteaks; whereas his father\'s appetite for solid food had never\r\nflagged. Those who were intimate with the family, and were observant\r\nof men, were wont to remark that the son would never fill the\r\nfather\'s shoes. These family friends, I may perhaps add, were\r\ngenerally markers at billiard-tables, head grooms at race-courses, or\r\nother men of that sharp, discerning class. Seeing that I introduce\r\nthese gentlemen to my readers at the Kanturk Hotel, in South Main\r\nStreet, Cork, it may be perhaps as well to add that they were both\r\nEnglishmen; so that mistakes on that matter may be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe father, as soon as he had rid himself of his upper coat, his\r\ndripping hat, and his goloshes, stood up with his back to the\r\nbar-room fire, with his hands in his trousers-pockets, and the tails\r\nof his coat stuck inside his arms.\r\n\r\n"I tell you, Aby, it was cold enough outside that infernal coach. I\'m\r\nblessed if I\'ve a morsel of feeling in my toes yet. Why the d----\r\ndon\'t they continue the railway on to Cork? It\'s as much as a man\'s\r\nlife is worth to travel in that sort of way at this time of the\r\nyear."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have more of it then if you intend going out of town\r\nto-morrow," said the son.\r\n\r\n"Well; I don\'t know that I shall. I shall take a day to consider of\r\nit I think."\r\n\r\n"Consideration be bothered," said Mollett junior; "strike when the\r\niron\'s hot; that\'s my motto."\r\n\r\nThe father here turned half round to his son and winked at him,\r\nnodding his head slightly towards the girl, thereby giving token\r\nthat, according to his ideas, the conversation could not be\r\ndiscreetly carried on before a third person.\r\n\r\n"All right," said the son, lifting his joram of brandy and water to\r\nhis mouth; an action in which he was immediately imitated by his\r\nfather, who had now received the means of doing so from the hands of\r\nthe fair Fanny.\r\n\r\n"And how about a bed, my dear?" said Mollett senior; "that\'s a matter\r\nof importance too; or will be when we are getting on to the little\r\nhours."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we won\'t turn you out, Mr. Mollett," said Fanny; "we\'ll find a\r\nbed for you, never fear."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right then, my little Venus. And now if I had some dinner\r\nI\'d sit down and make myself comfortable for the evening."\r\n\r\nAs he said this, Fanny slipped out of the room, and ran down into the\r\nkitchen to see what Tom and the cook were doing. The Molletts, father\r\nand son, were rather more than ordinary good customers at the Kanturk\r\nHotel, and it was politic therefore to treat them well. Mr. Mollett\r\njunior, moreover, was almost more than a customer; and for the sake\r\nof the son Fanny was anxious that the father should be well treated.\r\n\r\n"Well, governor, and what have you done?" said the younger man in a\r\nlow voice, jumping up from his seat as soon as the girl had left them\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ve got the usual remittance from the man in Bucklersbury.\r\nThat was all as right as a trivet."\r\n\r\n"And no more than that? Then I tell you what it is; we must be down\r\non him at once."\r\n\r\n"But you forget that I got as much more last month, out of the usual\r\ncourse. Come, Aby, don\'t you be unreasonable."\r\n\r\n"Bother--I tell you, governor, if he don\'t--" And then Miss O\'Dwyer\r\nreturned to her sanctum, and the rest of the conversation was\r\nnecessarily postponed.\r\n\r\n"He\'s managed to get you a lovely steak, Mr. Mollett," said Fanny,\r\npronouncing the word as though it were written "steek." "And we\'ve\r\nbeautiful pickled walnuts; haven\'t we, Mr. Aby? and there\'ll be\r\nkidneys biled" (meaning potatoes) "by the time the \'steek\'s\' ready.\r\nYou like it with the gravy in, don\'t you, Mr. Mollett?" And as she\r\nspoke she drew a quartern of whisky for two of Beamish and Crawford\'s\r\ndraymen, who stood outside in the passage and drank it at the bar.\r\n\r\nThe lovely "steek" with the gravy in it--that is to say, nearly\r\nraw--was now ready, and father and son adjourned to the next room.\r\n"Well, Tom, my lad of wax; and how\'s the world using you?" said Mr.\r\nMollett senior.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t much difference then," said Tom; "I ain\'t no younger,\r\nnor yet no richer than when yer honour left us--and what is\'t to be,\r\nsir?--a pint of stout, sir?"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Mr. Mollett senior had finished his dinner, and Tom had\r\nbrought the father and son materials for making whisky-punch, they\r\nboth got their knees together over the fire, and commenced the\r\nconfidential conversation which Miss O\'Dwyer had interrupted on her\r\nreturn to the bar-room. They spoke now almost in a whisper, with\r\ntheir heads together over the fender, knowing from experience that\r\nwhat Tom wanted in eyes he made up in ears.\r\n\r\n"And what did Prendergast say when he paid you the rhino?" asked the\r\nson.\r\n\r\n"Not a word," said the other. "After all, I don\'t think he knows\r\nany more than a ghost what he pays it for: I think he gets fresh\r\ninstructions every time. But, any ways, there it was, all right."\r\n\r\n"Hall right, indeed! I do believe you\'d be satisfied to go on getting\r\na few dribblets now and then like that. And then if anything \'appened\r\nto you, why I might go fish."\r\n\r\n"How, Aby, look here--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s hall very well, governor; but I\'ll tell you what. Since you\r\nstarted off I\'ve been thinking a good deal about it, and I\'ve made up\r\nmy mind that this shilly-shallying won\'t do any good: we must strike\r\na blow that\'ll do something for us."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t think we\'ve done so bad already, taking it\r\nall-in-all."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s because you haven\'t the pluck to strike a good blow.\r\nNow I\'ll just let you know what I propose--and I tell you fairly,\r\ngovernor, if you\'ll not hear reason, I\'ll take the game into my own\r\nhands."\r\n\r\nThe father looked up from his drink and scowled at his son, but said\r\nnothing in answer to this threat.\r\n\r\n"By G---- I will!" continued Aby. "It\'s no use \'umbugging, and I mean\r\nto make myself understood. While you\'ve been gone I\'ve been down to\r\nthat place."\r\n\r\n"You \'aven\'t seen the old man?"\r\n\r\n"No; I \'aven\'t taken that step yet; but I think it\'s very likely I\r\nmay before long if you won\'t hear reason."\r\n\r\n"I was a d---- fool, Aby, ever to let you into the affair at all.\r\nIt\'s been going on quiet enough for the last ten years, till I let\r\nyou into the secret."\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind about that. That mischief\'s done. But I think\r\nyou\'ll find I\'ll pull you through a deal better than hever you\'d have\r\npulled through yourself. You\'re already making twice more out of it\r\nthan you did before I knew it. As I was saying, I went down there;\r\nand in my quiet way I did just venture on a few hinquiries."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound you did. You\'ll blow it all in about another month,\r\nand then it\'ll be up with the lot of us."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a beautiful place: a lovely spot; and hall in prime horder.\r\nThey say it\'s fifteen thousand a year, and that there\'s not a\r\nshilling howing on the whole property. Even in these times the\r\ntenants are paying the rent, when no one else, far and near,\r\nis getting a penny out of them. I went by another place on the\r\nroad--Castle Desmond they call it, and I wish you\'d seen the\r\ndifference. The old boy must be rolling in money."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it. There\'s one as I can trust has told me he\'s hard\r\nup enough sometimes. Why, we\'ve had twelve hundred in the last eight\r\nmonths."\r\n\r\n"Twelve hundred! and what\'s that? But, dickens, governor, where has\r\nthe twelve hundred gone? I\'ve only seen three of it, and part of\r\nthat--. Well; what do you want there, you long-eared shark, you?"\r\nThese last words were addressed to Tom, who had crept into the room,\r\ncertainly without much preparatory noise.\r\n\r\n"I was only wanting the thingumbob, yer honour," said Tom, pretending\r\nto search diligently in the drawer for some required article.\r\n\r\n"Then take your thingumbob quickly out of that, and be d---- to you.\r\nAnd look here; if you don\'t knock at the door when next you come in,\r\nby heavens I\'ll throw this tumbler at your yead."\r\n\r\n"Sure and I will, yer honour," said Tom, withdrawing.\r\n\r\n"And where on hearth has the twelve hundred pounds gone?" asked the\r\nson, looking severely at the father.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Mollett made no immediate answer in words, but putting his\r\nleft hand to his right elbow, began to shake it.\r\n\r\n"I do wonder that you keep hon at that work," said Mollett junior,\r\nreproachfully. "You never by any chance have a stroke of luck."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have been unfortunate lately; but who knows what\'s coming?\r\nAnd I was deucedly sold by those fellows at the October meeting. If\r\nany chap ever was safe, I ought to have been safe then; but hang me\r\nif I didn\'t drop four hundred of Sir Thomas\'s shiners coolly on the\r\nspot. That was the only big haul I\'ve had out of him all at once; and\r\nthe most of it went like water through a sieve within forty-eight\r\nhours after I touched it." And then, having finished this pathetical\r\nlittle story of his misfortune, Mr. Mollett senior finished his glass\r\nof toddy.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the way of the world, governor; and it\'s no use sighing after\r\nspilt milk. But I\'ll tell you what I propose; and if you don\'t like\r\nthe task yourself, I have no hobjection in life to take it into my\r\nown hands. You see the game\'s so much our own that there\'s nothing on\r\nhearth for us to fear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that. If we were all blown, where should we be--"\r\n\r\n"Why, she\'s your own--"\r\n\r\n"H-h-sh, Aby. There\'s that confounded long-eared fellow at the\r\nkeyhole, as sure as my name\'s Matthew; and if he hears you, the\r\ngame\'s all up with a vengeance."\r\n\r\n"Lord bless you, what could he hear? Besides, talking as we are now,\r\nhe wouldn\'t catch a word even if he were in the room itself. And now\r\nI\'ll tell you what it is; do you go down yourself, and make your way\r\ninto the hold gentleman\'s room. Just send your own name in boldly.\r\nNobody will know what that means, except himself."\r\n\r\n"I did that once before; and I never shall forget it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did it once before, and you have had a steady income\r\nto live on ever since; not such an income as you might have had.\r\nNot such an income as will do for you and me, now that we both\r\nknow so well what a fine property we have under our thumbs. But,\r\nnevertheless, that little visit has been worth something to you."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Aby, I never suffered so much as I did that day. I\r\ndidn\'t know till then that I had a soft heart."\r\n\r\n"Soft heart! Oh, bother. Such stuff as that always makes me sick. If\r\nI \'ate anything, it\'s maudlin. Your former visit down there did very\r\nwell, and now you must make another, or else, by the holy poker! I\'ll\r\nmake it for you."\r\n\r\n"And what would you have me say to him if I did manage to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps I\'d better go--"\r\n\r\n"That\'s out of the question. He wouldn\'t see you, or understand who\r\nyou were. And then you\'d make a row, and it would all come out, and\r\nthe fat would be in the fire."\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess I should not take it quite quiet if they didn\'t treat\r\nme as a gentleman should be treated. I ain\'t always over-quiet if I\'m\r\nput upon."\r\n\r\n"If you go near that house at all I\'ll have done with it. I\'ll give\r\nup the game."\r\n\r\n"Well, do you go, at any rate first. Perhaps it may be well that I\r\nshould follow after with a reminder. Do you go down, and just tell\r\nhim this, quite coolly, remember--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shall be cool enough."\r\n\r\n"That, considering hall things, you think he and you ought to--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Just divide it between you; share and share alike. Say it\'s fourteen\r\nthousand--and it\'s more than that--that would be seven for him and\r\nseven for you. Tell him you\'ll agree to that, but you won\'t take one\r\nfarthing less."\r\n\r\n"Aby!" said the father, almost overcome by the grandeur of his son\'s\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n"Well; and what of Haby? What\'s the matter now?"\r\n\r\n"Expect him to shell out seven thousand pounds a year!"\r\n\r\n"And why not? He\'ll do a deal more than that, I expect, if he were\r\nquite sure that it would make all things serene. But it won\'t; and\r\ntherefore you must make him another hoffer."\r\n\r\n"Another offer!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He\'ll know well enough that you\'ll be thinking of his death.\r\nAnd for all they do say he might pop off any day."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a younger man than me, Aby, by full ten years."\r\n\r\n"What of that? You may pop off any day too, mayn\'t you? I believe you\r\nold fellows don\'t think of dying nigh as hoften as we young ones."\r\n\r\n"You young ones are always looking for us old ones to go. We all know\r\nthat well enough."\r\n\r\n"That\'s when you\'ve got anything to leave behind you, which hain\'t\r\nthe case with you, governor, just at present. But what I was saying\r\nis this. He\'ll know well enough that you can split upon his son\r\nhafter he\'s gone, every bit as well as you can split on him now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I always looked to make the young gentleman pay up handsome, if\r\nso be the old gentleman went off the hooks. And if so be he and I\r\nshould go off together like, why you\'d carry on, of course. You\'ll\r\nhave the proofs, you know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I should, should I? Well, we\'ll look to them by-and-by. But\r\nI\'ll tell you what, governor, the best way is to make all that safe.\r\nWe\'ll make him another hoffer--for a regular substantial family\r\nharrangement--"\r\n\r\n"A family arrangement, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that\'s the way they always manage things when great family\r\nhinterests is at stake. Let him give us a cool seven thousand a year\r\nbetween us while he\'s alive; let him put you down for twenty thousand\r\nwhen he\'s dead--that\'d come out of the young gentleman\'s share of the\r\nproperty, of course--and then let him give me his daughter Hemmeline,\r\nwith another twenty thousand tacked on to her skirt-tail. I should be\r\nmum then for hever for the honour of the family."\r\n\r\nThe father for a moment or two was struck dumb by the magnitude\r\nof his son\'s proposition. "That\'s what I call playing the game\r\nfirm," continued the son. "Do you lay down your terms before him,\r\nsubstantial, and then stick to \'em. \'Them\'s my terms, Sir Thomas,\'\r\nyou\'ll say. \'If you don\'t like \'em, as I can\'t halter, why in course\r\nI\'ll go elsewhere.\' Do you be firm to that, and you\'ll see how the\r\ngame\'ll go."\r\n\r\n"And you think he\'ll give you his daughter in marriage?"\r\n\r\n"Why not? I\'m honest born, hain\'t I? And she\'s a bastard."\r\n\r\n"But, Aby, you don\'t know what sort of people these are. You don\'t\r\nknow what her breeding has been."\r\n\r\n"D---- her breeding. I know this: she\'d get a deuced pretty fellow\r\nfor her husband, and one that girls as good as her has hankered\r\nhafter long enough. It won\'t do, governor, to let people as is in\r\ntheir position pick and choose like. We\'ve the hupper hand, and we\r\nmust do the picking and choosing."\r\n\r\n"She\'d never have you, Aby; not if her father went down on his knees\r\nto her to ask her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, wouldn\'t she? By heaven, then, she shall, and that without any\r\nkneeling at all. She shall have me, and be deuced glad to take me.\r\nWhat! she\'d refuse a fellow like me when she knows that she and all\r\nbelonging to her\'d be turned into the streets if she don\'t have me!\r\nI\'m clear of another way of thinking, then. My opinion is she\'d come\r\nto me jumping. I\'ll tell you what, governor, you don\'t know the sex."\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett senior upon this merely shook his head. Perhaps the fact\r\nwas that he knew the sex somewhat better than his son. It had been\r\nhis fate during a portion of his life to live among people who were,\r\nor ought to have been, gentlemen. He might have been such himself had\r\nhe not gone wrong in life from the very starting-post. But his son\r\nhad had no such opportunities. He did know and could know nothing\r\nabout ladies and gentlemen.\r\n\r\n"You\'re mistaken, Aby," said the old man. "They\'d never suffer you to\r\ncome among them on such a footing as that. They\'d sooner go forth to\r\nthe world as beggars."\r\n\r\n"Then, by G----! they shall go forth as beggars. I\'ve said it now,\r\nfather, and I\'ll stick to it. You know the stuff I\'m made of." As he\r\nfinished speaking, he swallowed down the last half of a third glass\r\nof hot spirits and water, and then glared on his father with angry,\r\nblood-shot eyes, and a red, almost lurid face. The unfortunate father\r\nwas beginning to know the son, and to feel that his son would become\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nShortly after this they were interrupted; and what further\r\nconversation they had on the matter that night took place in their\r\njoint bedroom; to which uninviting retreat it is not now necessary\r\nthat we should follow them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMINE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey who were in the south of Ireland during the winter of 1846-47\r\nwill not readily forget the agony of that period. For many, many\r\nyears preceding and up to that time, the increasing swarms of the\r\ncountry had been fed upon the potato, and upon the potato only; and\r\nnow all at once the potato failed them, and the greater part of eight\r\nmillion human beings were left without food.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the potato was the work of God; and it was natural\r\nto attribute the sufferings which at once overwhelmed the unfortunate\r\ncountry to God\'s anger--to his wrath for the misdeeds of which\r\nthat country had been guilty. For myself, I do not believe in such\r\nexhibitions of God\'s anger. When wars come, and pestilence, and\r\nfamine; when the people of a land are worse than decimated, and the\r\nliving hardly able to bury the dead, I cannot coincide with those who\r\nwould deprecate God\'s wrath by prayers. I do not believe that our God\r\nstalks darkly along the clouds, laying thousands low with the arrows\r\nof death, and those thousands the most ignorant, because men who are\r\nnot ignorant have displeased Him. Nor, if in his wisdom He did do so,\r\ncan I think that men\'s prayers would hinder that which his wisdom had\r\nseen to be good and right.\r\n\r\nBut though I do not believe in exhibitions of God\'s anger, I do\r\nbelieve in exhibitions of his mercy. When men by their folly and by\r\nthe shortness of their vision have brought upon themselves penalties\r\nwhich seem to be overwhelming, to which no end can be seen, which\r\nwould be overwhelming were no aid coming to us but our own, then God\r\nraises his hand, not in anger, but in mercy, and by his wisdom does\r\nfor us that for which our own wisdom has been insufficient.\r\n\r\nBut on no Christian basis can I understand the justice or acknowledge\r\nthe propriety of asking our Lord to abate his wrath in detail, or to\r\nalter his settled purpose. If He be wise, would we change his wisdom?\r\nIf He be merciful, would we limit his mercy? There comes upon us some\r\nstrange disease, and we bid Him to stay his hand. But the disease,\r\nwhen it has passed by, has taught us lessons of cleanliness, which\r\nno master less stern would have made acceptable. A famine strikes us,\r\nand we again beg that that hand may be stayed;--beg as the Greeks\r\nwere said to beg when they thought that the anger of Phoebus was\r\nhot against them because his priest had been dishonoured. We so beg,\r\nthinking that God\'s anger is hot also against us. But, lo! the famine\r\npasses by, and a land that had been brought to the dust by man\'s\r\nfolly is once more prosperous and happy.\r\n\r\nIf this was ever so in the world\'s history, it was so in Ireland\r\nat the time of which I am speaking. The country, especially in the\r\nsouth and west, had been brought to a terrible pass;--not as so\r\nmany said and do say, by the idolatry of popery, or by the sedition\r\nof demagogues, or even mainly by the idleness of the people. The\r\nidolatry of popery, to my way of thinking, is bad; though not so bad\r\nin Ireland as in most other Papist countries that I have visited.\r\nSedition also is bad; but in Ireland, in late years, it has not been\r\ndeep-seated--as may have been noted at Ballingarry and other places,\r\nwhere endeavour was made to bring sedition to its proof. And as for\r\nthe idleness of Ireland\'s people, I am inclined to think they will\r\nwork under the same compulsion and same persuasion which produce work\r\nin other countries.\r\n\r\nThe fault had been the lowness of education and consequent want of\r\nprinciple among the middle classes; and this fault had been found as\r\nstrongly marked among the Protestants as it had been among the Roman\r\nCatholics. Young men were brought up to do nothing. Property was\r\nregarded as having no duties attached to it. Men became rapacious,\r\nand determined to extract the uttermost farthing out of the land\r\nwithin their power, let the consequences to the people on that land\r\nbe what they might.\r\n\r\nWe used to hear much of absentees. It was not the absence of the\r\nabsentees that did the damage, but the presence of those they left\r\nbehind them on the soil. The scourge of Ireland was the existence\r\nof a class who looked to be gentlemen living on their property,\r\nbut who should have earned their bread by the work of their brain,\r\nor, failing that, by the sweat of their brow. There were men to be\r\nfound in shoals through the country speaking of their properties and\r\nboasting of their places, but who owned no properties and had no\r\nplaces when the matter came to be properly sifted.\r\n\r\nMost Englishmen have heard of profit-rent. In Ireland the term is\r\nso common that no man cannot have heard of it. It may, of course,\r\ndesignate a very becoming sort of income. A man may, for instance,\r\ntake a plot of land for one hundred pounds a year, improve and build\r\non it till it be fairly worth one thousand pounds a year, and thus\r\nenjoy a profit-rent of nine hundred pounds. Nothing can be better or\r\nfairer. But in Ireland the management was very different. Men there\r\nheld tracts of ground, very often at their full value, paying for\r\nthem such proportion of rent as a farmer could afford to pay in\r\nEngland and live. But the Irish tenant would by no means consent to\r\nbe a farmer. It was needful to him that he should be a gentleman, and\r\nthat his sons should be taught to live and amuse themselves as the\r\nsons of gentlemen--barring any such small trifle as education. They\r\ndid live in this way; and to enable them to do so, they underlet\r\ntheir land in small patches, and at an amount of rent to collect\r\nwhich took the whole labour of their tenants, and the whole produce\r\nof the small patch, over and above the quantity of potatoes\r\nabsolutely necessary to keep that tenant\'s body and soul together.\r\n\r\nAnd thus a state of things was engendered in Ireland which\r\ndiscouraged labour, which discouraged improvements in farming,\r\nwhich discouraged any produce from the land except the potato crop;\r\nwhich maintained one class of men in what they considered to be the\r\ngentility of idleness, and another class, the people of the country,\r\nin the abjectness of poverty.\r\n\r\nIt is with thorough rejoicing, almost with triumph, that I declare\r\nthat the idle, genteel class has been cut up root and branch, has\r\nbeen driven forth out of its holding into the wide world, and has\r\nbeen punished with the penalty of extermination. The poor cotter\r\nsuffered sorely under the famine, and under the pestilence which\r\nfollowed the famine; but he, as a class, has risen from his bed of\r\nsuffering a better man. He is thriving as a labourer either in his\r\nown country or in some newer--for him better--land to which he has\r\nemigrated. He, even in Ireland, can now get eight and nine shillings\r\na week easier and with more constancy than he could get four some\r\nfifteen years since. But the other man has gone, and his place is\r\nleft happily vacant.\r\n\r\nThere are an infinite number of smaller bearings in which this\r\nquestion of the famine, and of agricultural distress in Ireland, may\r\nbe regarded, and should be regarded by those who wish to understand\r\nit. The manner in which the Poor Law was first rejected and then\r\naccepted, and then, if one may say so, swallowed whole by the people;\r\nthe way in which emigration has affected them; the difference in the\r\nsystem of labour there from that here, which in former days was so\r\nstrong that an agricultural labourer living on his wages and buying\r\nfood with them, was a person hardly to be found: all these things\r\nmust be regarded by one who would understand the matter. But seeing\r\nthat this book of mine is a novel, I have perhaps already written\r\nmore on a dry subject than many will read.\r\n\r\nSuch having been the state of the country, such its wretchedness,\r\na merciful God sent the remedy which might avail to arrest it; and\r\nwe--we deprecated his wrath. But all this will soon be known and\r\nacknowledged; acknowledged as it is acknowledged that new cities\r\nrise up in splendour from the ashes into which old cities have been\r\nconsumed by fire. If this beneficent agency did not from time to time\r\ndisencumber our crowded places, we should ever be living in narrow\r\nalleys with stinking gutters, and supply of water at the minimum.\r\n\r\nBut very frightful are the flames as they rush through the chambers\r\nof the poor, and very frightful was the course of that violent remedy\r\nwhich brought Ireland out of its misfortunes. Those who saw its\r\ncourse, and watched its victims, will not readily forget what they\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nSlowly, gradually, and with a voice that was for a long time\r\ndiscredited, the news spread itself through the country that the food\r\nof the people was gone. That his own crop was rotten and useless each\r\ncotter quickly knew, and realized the idea that he must work for\r\nwages if he could get them, or else go to the poorhouse. That the\r\ncrop of his parish or district was gone became evident to the priest,\r\nand the parson, and the squire; and they realized the idea that they\r\nmust fall on other parishes or other districts for support. But it\r\nwas long before the fact made itself known that there was no food in\r\nany parish, in any district.\r\n\r\nWhen this was understood, men certainly did put their shoulders to\r\nthe wheel with a great effort. Much abuse at the time was thrown upon\r\nthe government; and they who took upon themselves the management of\r\nthe relief of the poor in the south-west were taken most severely\r\nto task. I was in the country, travelling always through it, during\r\nthe whole period, and I have to say--as I did say at the time with a\r\nvoice that was not very audible--that in my opinion the measures of\r\nthe government were prompt, wise, and beneficent; and I have to say\r\nalso that the efforts of those who managed the poor were, as a rule,\r\nunremitting, honest, impartial, and successful.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of four million starving people with food, to be brought\r\nfrom foreign lands, is not an easy job. No government could bring the\r\nfood itself; but by striving to do so it might effectually prevent\r\nsuch bringing on the part of others. Nor when the food was there,\r\non the quays, was it easy to put it, in due proportions, into the\r\nfour million mouths. Some mouths, and they, alas! the weaker ones,\r\nwould remain unfed. But the opportunity was a good one for slashing\r\nphilanthropical censure; and then the business of the slashing,\r\ncensorious philanthropist is so easy, so exciting, and so pleasant!\r\n\r\nI think that no portion of Ireland suffered more severely during\r\nthe famine than the counties Cork and Kerry. The poorest parts\r\nwere perhaps the parishes lying back from the sea and near to the\r\nmountains; and in the midst of such a district Desmond Court was\r\nsituated. The region immediately round Castle Richmond was perhaps\r\nbetter. The tenants there had more means at their disposal, and did\r\nnot depend so absolutely on the potato crop; but even round Castle\r\nRichmond the distress was very severe.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year relief committees were formed, on one of which\r\nyoung Herbert Fitzgerald agreed to act. His father promised, and was\r\nprepared to give his best assistance, both by money and countenance;\r\nbut he pleaded that the state of his health hindered him from active\r\nexertion, and therefore his son came forward in his stead on this\r\noccasion, as it appeared probable that he would do on all others\r\nhaving reference to the family property.\r\n\r\nThis work brought people together who would hardly have met but for\r\nsuch necessity. The priest and the parson of a parish, men who had\r\nhitherto never been in a room together, and between whom neither had\r\nknown anything of the other but the errors of his doctrine, found\r\nthemselves fighting for the same object at the same board, and each\r\nfor the moment laid aside his religious ferocity. Gentlemen, whose\r\nancestors had come over with Strongbow, or maybe even with Milesius,\r\nsat cheek by jowl with retired haberdashers, concerting new soup\r\nkitchens, and learning on what smallest modicum of pudding made\r\nfrom Indian corn a family of seven might be kept alive, and in such\r\ncondition that the father at least might be able to stand upright.\r\n\r\nThe town of Kanturk was the head-quarters of that circle to which\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald was attached, in which also would have been\r\nincluded the owner of Desmond Court, had there been an owner\r\nof an age to undertake such work. But the young earl was still\r\nunder sixteen, and the property was represented, as far as any\r\nrepresentation was made, by the countess.\r\n\r\nBut even in such a work as this, a work which so strongly brought out\r\nwhat there was of good among the upper classes, there was food for\r\njealousy and ill will. The name of Owen Fitzgerald at this time did\r\nnot stand high in the locality of which we are speaking. Men had\r\npresumed to talk both to him and of him, and he replied to their\r\ncensures by scorn. He would not change his mode of living for them,\r\nor allow them to believe that their interference could in any way\r\noperate upon his conduct. He had therefore affected a worse character\r\nfor morals than he had perhaps truly deserved, and had thus thrown\r\noff from him all intimacy with many of the families among whom he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, he had come forward as others had done, offering to\r\njoin his brother-magistrates and the clergyman of the district in\r\ntheir efforts, they had, or he had thought that they had, looked\r\ncoldly on him. His property was half way between Kanturk and Mallow;\r\nand when this occurred he turned his shoulder upon the former place,\r\nand professed to act with those whose meetings were held at the\r\nlatter town. Thus he became altogether divided from that Castle\r\nRichmond neighbourhood to which he was naturally attached by old\r\nintimacies and family ties.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard time this for the poor countess. I have endeavoured to\r\nexplain that the position in which she had been left with regard to\r\nmoney was not at any time a very easy one. She possessed high rank\r\nand the name of a countess, but very little of that wealth which\r\nusually constitutes the chief advantage of such rank and name. But\r\nnow such means as had been at her disposal were terribly crippled.\r\nThere was no poorer district than that immediately around her, and\r\nnone, therefore, in which the poor rates rose to a more fearful\r\nproportion of the rent. The country was, and for that matter still\r\nis, divided, for purposes of poor-law rating, into electoral\r\ndistricts. In ordinary times a man, or at any rate a lady, may live\r\nand die in his or her own house without much noticing the limits or\r\npeculiarities of each district. In one the rate may be one and a\r\npenny in the pound, in another only a shilling. But the difference\r\nis not large enough to create inquiry. It is divided between the\r\nlandlord and the tenant, and neither perhaps thinks much about it.\r\nBut when the demand made rises to seventeen or eighteen shillings in\r\nthe pound--as was the case in some districts in those days,--when out\r\nof every pound of rent that he paid the tenant claimed to deduct nine\r\nshillings for poor rates, that is, half the amount levied--then a\r\nlandlord becomes anxious enough as to the peculiarities of his own\r\nelectoral division.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Protestant clergymen, the whole rate had to be paid\r\nby the incumbent. A gentleman whose half-yearly rent-charge amounted\r\nto perhaps two hundred pounds might have nine tenths of that sum\r\ndeducted from him for poor rates. I have known a case in which the\r\nproportion has been higher than this.\r\n\r\nAnd then the tenants in such districts began to decline to pay any\r\nrent at all--in very many cases could pay no rent at all. They, too,\r\ndepended on the potatoes which were gone; they, too, had been subject\r\nto those dreadful demands for poor rates; and thus a landlord whose\r\nproperty was in any way embarrassed had but a bad time of it. The\r\nproperty from which Lady Desmond drew her income had been very much\r\nembarrassed; and for her the times were very bad.\r\n\r\nIn such periods of misfortune, a woman has always some friend. Let\r\nher be who she may, some pair of broad shoulders is forthcoming on\r\nwhich may be laid so much of the burden as is by herself unbearable.\r\nIt is the great privilege of womanhood, that which compensates them\r\nfor the want of those other privileges which belong exclusively to\r\nmanhood--sitting in Parliament, for instance, preaching sermons, and\r\ngoing on \'Change.\r\n\r\nAt this time Lady Desmond would doubtless have chosen the shoulders\r\nof Owen Fitzgerald for the bearing of her burden, had he not turned\r\nagainst her, as he had done. But now there was no hope of that. Those\r\nbroad shoulders had burdens of their own to bear of another sort, and\r\nit was at any rate impossible that he should come to share those of\r\nDesmond Court.\r\n\r\nBut a champion was forthcoming; one, indeed, whose shoulders were\r\nless broad; on looking at whose head and brow Lady Desmond could not\r\nforget her years as she had done while Owen Fitzgerald had been near\r\nher;--but a champion, nevertheless, whom she greatly prized. This was\r\nOwen\'s cousin, Herbert Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," her daughter said to her one evening, as they were sitting\r\ntogether in the only room which they now inhabited. "Herbert wants us\r\nto go to that place near Kilcommon to-morrow, and says he will send\r\nthe car at two. I suppose I can go?"\r\n\r\nThere were two things that Lady Desmond noticed in this: first, that\r\nher daughter should have called young Mr. Fitzgerald by his Christian\r\nname; and secondly, that it should have come to that with them, that\r\na Fitzgerald should send a vehicle for a Desmond, seeing that the\r\nDesmond could no longer provide a vehicle for herself.\r\n\r\n"You could have had the pony-chair, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, mamma; I would not do that." The pony was now the only\r\nquadruped kept for the countess\'s own behoof; and the young earl\'s\r\nhunter was the only other horse in the Desmond Court stables. "I\r\nwouldn\'t do that, mamma; Mary and Emmeline will not mind coming\r\nround."\r\n\r\n"But they will have to come round again to bring you back."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma. Herbert said they wouldn\'t mind it. We want to see how\r\nthey are managing at the new soup kitchen they have there. That one\r\nat Clady is very bad. The boiler won\'t boil at all."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear; only mind you wrap yourself up."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I always do."\r\n\r\n"But, Clara--" and Lady Desmond put on her sweetest, smoothest smile\r\nas she spoke to her daughter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"How long have you taken to call young Mr. Fitzgerald by his\r\nChristian name?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I never do, mamma," said Clara, with a blush all over her face;\r\n"not to himself, I mean. You see, Mary and Emmeline are always\r\ntalking about him."\r\n\r\n"And therefore you mean always to talk about him also."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma. But one can\'t help talking about him; he is doing so much\r\nfor these poor people. I don\'t think he ever thinks about anything\r\nelse from morning to night. Emmeline says he always goes to it again\r\nafter dinner. Don\'t you think he is very good about it, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear; very good indeed; almost good enough to be called\r\nHerbert."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t call him so; you know I don\'t," protested Clara, very\r\nenergetically.\r\n\r\n"He is very good," continued the countess; "very good indeed. I don\'t\r\nknow what on earth we should do without him. If he were my own son,\r\nhe could hardly be more attentive to me."\r\n\r\n"Then I may go with the girls to that place? I always forget the\r\nname."\r\n\r\n"Gortnaclough, you mean."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma. It is all Sir Thomas\'s property there; and they have got\r\na regular kitchen, beautifully built, Her--Mr. Fitzgerald says, with\r\na regular cook. I do wish we could have one at Clady."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald will be here to-morrow morning, and I will talk to\r\nhim about it. I fear we have not sufficient funds there."\r\n\r\n"No; that\'s just it. I do wish I had some money now. You won\'t mind\r\nif I am not home quite early? We all mean to dine there at the\r\nkitchen. The girls will bring something, and then we can stay out the\r\nwhole afternoon."\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do for you to be out after nightfall, Clara."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t, mamma. They did want me to go home with them to Castle\r\nRichmond for to-morrow night; but I declined that," and Clara uttered\r\na slight sigh, as though she had declined something that would have\r\nbeen very pleasant to her.\r\n\r\n"And why did you decline it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. I didn\'t know whether you would like it; and\r\nbesides--"\r\n\r\n"Besides what?"\r\n\r\n"You\'d be here all alone, mamma."\r\n\r\nThe countess got up from her chair and coming over to the place where\r\nher daughter was sitting, kissed her on her forehead. "In such a\r\nmatter as that, I don\'t want you to think of me, my dear. I would\r\nrather you went out. I must remain here in this horrid, dull,\r\nwretched place; but that is no reason why you should be buried alive.\r\nI would much rather that you went out sometimes."\r\n\r\n"No, mamma; I will remain with you."\r\n\r\n"It will be quite right that you should go to Castle Richmond\r\nto-morrow. If they send their carriage round here for you--"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll only be the car."\r\n\r\n"Well, the car; and if the girls come all that way out of their road\r\nin the morning to pick you up, it will be only civil that you should\r\ngo back by Castle Richmond, and you would enjoy an evening there with\r\nthe girls very much."\r\n\r\n"But I said decidedly that I would not go."\r\n\r\n"Tell them to-morrow as decidedly that you have changed your\r\nmind, and will be delighted to accept their invitation. They will\r\nunderstand that it is because you have spoken to me."\r\n\r\n"But, mamma--"\r\n\r\n"You will like going; will you not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I shall like it."\r\n\r\nAnd so that matter was settled. On the whole, Lady Desmond was\r\ninclined to admit within her own heart that her daughter had behaved\r\nvery well in that matter of the banishment of Owen Fitzgerald. She\r\nknew that Clara had never seen him, and had refused to open his\r\nletters. Very little had been said upon the subject between the\r\nmother and daughter. Once or twice Owen\'s name had been mentioned;\r\nand once, when it had been mentioned, with heavy blame on account of\r\nhis alleged sins, Clara had ventured to take his part.\r\n\r\n"People delight to say ill-natured things," she had said; "but one is\r\nnot obliged to believe them all."\r\n\r\nFrom that time Lady Desmond had never mentioned his name, rightly\r\njudging that Clara would be more likely to condemn him in her own\r\nheart if she did not hear him condemned by others: and so the mother\r\nand daughter had gone on, as though the former had lost no friend,\r\nand the latter had lost no lover.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the love adventure, Clara had been pale and\r\ndrooping, and the countess had been frightened about her; but\r\nlatterly she had got over this. The misfortune which had fallen so\r\nheavily upon them all seemed to have done her good. She had devoted\r\nherself from the first to do her little quota of work towards\r\nlessening the suffering around her, and the effort had been salutary\r\nto her.\r\n\r\nWhether or no in her heart of hearts she did still think of Owen\r\nFitzgerald, her mother was unable to surmise. From the fire which\r\nhad flashed from her eyes on that day when she accused the world of\r\nsaying ill-natured things of him, Lady Desmond had been sure that\r\nsuch was the case. But she had never ventured to probe her child\'s\r\nheart. She had given very little confidence to Clara, and could not,\r\ntherefore, and did not expect confidence in return.\r\n\r\nNor was Clara a girl likely in such a matter to bestow confidence on\r\nany one. She was one who could hold her heart full, and yet not speak\r\nof her heart\'s fulness. Her mother had called her a child, and in\r\nsome respects she then was so; but this childishness had been caused,\r\nnot by lack of mental power, but want of that conversation with\r\nothers which is customary to girls of her age. This want had in some\r\nrespects made her childish; for it hindered her from expressing\r\nherself in firm tones, and caused her to blush and hesitate when she\r\nspoke. But in some respects it had the opposite effect, and made her\r\nolder than her age, for she was thoughtful, silent, and patient of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nLatterly, since this dreary famine-time had come upon them, an\r\nintimacy had sprung up between Clara and the Castle Richmond girls,\r\nand in a measure, too, between Clara and Herbert Fitzgerald. Lady\r\nDesmond had seen this with great pleasure. Though she had objected\r\nto Owen Fitzgerald for her daughter, she had no objection to the\r\nFitzgerald name. Herbert was his father\'s only son, and heir to the\r\nfinest property in the county--at any rate, to the property which at\r\npresent was the best circumstanced. Owen Fitzgerald could never be\r\nmore than a little squire, but Herbert would be a baronet. Owen\'s\r\nutmost ambition would be to live at Hap House all his life, and\r\ndie the oracle of the Duhallow hunt; but Herbert would be a member\r\nof Parliament, with a house in London. A daughter of the house of\r\nDesmond might marry the heir of Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, and be thought\r\nto have done well; whereas, she would disgrace herself by becoming\r\nthe mistress of Hap House. Lady Desmond, therefore, had been\r\ndelighted to see this intimacy.\r\n\r\nIt had been in no spirit of fault-finding that she had remarked to\r\nher daughter as to her use of that Christian name. What would be\r\nbetter than that they should be to each other as Herbert and Clara?\r\nBut the cautious mother had known how easy it would be to frighten\r\nher timid fawn-like child. It was no time, no time as yet, to\r\nquestion her heart about this second lover--if lover he might be. The\r\ncountess was much too subtle in her way to frighten her child\'s heart\r\nback to its old passion. That passion doubtless would die from want\r\nof food. Let it be starved and die; and then this other new passion\r\nmight spring up.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Desmond had no idea that her daughter, with severe\r\nself-questioning, had taken her own heart to task about this former\r\nlover; had argued with herself that the man who could so sin, could\r\nlive such a life, and so live in these fearful times, was unworthy of\r\nher love, and must be torn out of her heart, let the cost be what it\r\nmight. Of such high resolves on her daughter\'s part, nay, on the part\r\nof any young girl, Lady Desmond had no knowledge.\r\n\r\nClara Desmond had determined, slowly determined, to give up the man\r\nwhom she had owned to love. She had determined that duty and female\r\ndignity required her to do so. And in this manner it had been done;\r\nnot by the childlike forgetfulness which her mother attributed to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was arranged that she should stay the following night at\r\nCastle Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nGORTNACLOUGH AND BERRYHILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now at last we will get to Castle Richmond, at which place,\r\nseeing that it gives the title to our novel, we ought to have arrived\r\nlong since.\r\n\r\nAs had been before arranged, the two Miss Fitzgeralds did call at\r\nDesmond Court early on the following day, and were delighted at being\r\ninformed by Lady Desmond that Clara had changed her mind, and would,\r\nif they would now allow her, stay the night at Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"The truth was, she did not like to leave me," said the countess,\r\nwhispering prettily into the ear of the eldest of the two girls; "but\r\nI am delighted that she should have an opportunity of getting out of\r\nthis dull place for a few hours. It was so good of you to think of\r\nher."\r\n\r\nMiss Fitzgerald made some civil answer, and away they all went.\r\nHerbert was on horseback, and remained some minutes after them to\r\ndiscuss her own difficulties with the countess, and to say a few\r\nwords about that Clady boiler that would not boil. Clara on this\r\nsubject had opened her heart to him, and he had resolved that the\r\nboiler should be made to boil. So he said that he would go over and\r\nlook at it, resolving also to send that which would be much more\r\nefficacious than himself, namely, the necessary means and workmen\r\nfor bringing about so desirable a result. And then he rode after the\r\ngirls, and caught the car just as it reached Gortnaclough.\r\n\r\nHow they all spent their day at the soup kitchen, which however,\r\nthough so called, partook quite as much of the character of a\r\nbake-house; how they studied the art of making yellow Indian meal\r\ninto puddings; how the girls wanted to add milk and sugar, not\r\nunderstanding at first the deep principles of political economy,\r\nwhich soon taught them not to waste on the comforts of a few that\r\nwhich was so necessary for the life of many; how the poor women\r\nbrought in their sick ailing children, accepting the proffered food,\r\nbut bitterly complaining of it as they took it,--complaining of it\r\nbecause they wanted money, with which they still thought that they\r\ncould buy potatoes--all this need not here or now be described. Our\r\npresent business is to get them all back to Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\nThere had been some talk of their dining at Gortnaclough, because it\r\nwas known that the ladies at Desmond Court dined early; but now that\r\nClara was to return to Castle Richmond, that idea was given up, and\r\nthey all got back to the house in time for the family dinner.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," said Emmeline, walking first into the drawing-room, "Lady\r\nClara has come back with us after all, and is going to stay here\r\nto-night; we are so glad."\r\n\r\nLady Fitzgerald got up from her sofa, and welcomed her young guest\r\nwith a kiss.\r\n\r\n"It is very good of you to come," she said; "very good indeed. You\r\nwon\'t find it dull, I hope, because I know you are thinking about the\r\nsame thing as these children."\r\n\r\nLady Clara muttered some sort of indistinct little protest as to the\r\nimpossibility of being dull with her present friends.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s as full of corn meal and pints of soup as any one," said\r\nEmmeline; "and knows exactly how much turf it takes to boil fifteen\r\nstone of pudding; don\'t you, Clara? But come up-stairs, for we\r\nhaven\'t long, and I know you are frozen. You must dress with us,\r\ndear; for there will be no fire in your own room, as we didn\'t expect\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I wish we could get them to like it," said Clara, standing with one\r\nfoot on the fender, in the middle of the process of dressing, so as\r\nto warm her toes; and her friend Emmeline was standing by her, with\r\nher arm round her waist.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think we shall ever do that," said Mary, who was sitting\r\nat the glass brushing her hair; "it\'s so cold, and heavy, and\r\nuncomfortable when they get it."\r\n\r\n"You see," said Emmeline, "though they did only have potatoes before,\r\nthey always had them quite warm; and though a dinner of potatoes\r\nseems very poor, they did have it altogether, in their own houses,\r\nyou know; and I think the very cooking it was some comfort to them."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose they couldn\'t be taught to cook this themselves, so as\r\nto make it comfortable in their own cabins?" said Clara,\r\ndespondingly.\r\n\r\n"Herbert says it\'s impossible," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m sure he knows," said Clara.\r\n\r\n"They would waste more than they would eat," said Emmeline. "Besides,\r\nit is so hard to cook it as it should be cooked; sometimes it seems\r\nimpossible to make it soft."\r\n\r\n"So it does," said Clara, sadly; "but if we could only have it hot\r\nfor them when they come for it, wouldn\'t that be better?"\r\n\r\n"The great thing is to have it for them at all," said Mary the wise\r\n(for she had been studying the matter more deeply than her friend);\r\n"there are so many who as yet get none."\r\n\r\n"Herbert says that the millers will grind up the husks and all at the\r\nmills, so as to make the most of it; that\'s what makes it so hard to\r\ncook," said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n"How very wrong of them!" protested Clara; "but isn\'t Herbert going\r\nto have a mill put up of his own?"\r\n\r\nAnd so they went on, till I fear they kept the Castle Richmond dinner\r\nwaiting for full fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nCastle Richmond, too, would have been a dull house, as Lady\r\nFitzgerald had intimated, had it not been that there was a common\r\nsubject of such vital interest to the whole party. On that subject\r\nthey were all intent, and on that subject they talked the whole\r\nevening, planning, preparing, and laying out schemes; devising how\r\ntheir money might be made to go furthest; discussing deep questions\r\nof political economy, and making, no doubt, many errors in their\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nLady Fitzgerald took a part in all this, and so occasionally did Sir\r\nThomas. Indeed, on this evening he was more active than was usual\r\nwith him. He got up from his arm-chair, and came to the table, in\r\norder that he might pore over the map of the estate with them; for\r\nthey were dividing the property into districts, and seeing how best\r\nthe poor might be visited in their own localities.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as he did so, he became liberal. Liberal, indeed, he always\r\nwas; but now he made offers of assistance more than his son had dared\r\nto ask; and they were all busy, contented, and in a great degree\r\njoyous--joyous, though their work arose from the contiguity of such\r\ninfinite misery. But what can ever be more joyous than efforts made\r\nfor lessening misery?\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Miss Letty was fast asleep in her own arm-chair.\r\nBut let no one on that account accuse her of a hard heart; for she\r\nhad nearly walked her old legs off that day in going about from cabin\r\nto cabin round the demesne.\r\n\r\n"But we must consult Somers about that mill," said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course," said Herbert; "I know how to talk Somers over."\r\n\r\nThis was added _sotto voce_ to his mother and the girls. Now Mr.\r\nSomers was the agent on the estate.\r\n\r\nThis mill was to be at Berryhill, a spot also on Sir Thomas\'s\r\nproperty, but in a different direction from Gortnaclough. There was\r\nthere what the Americans would call a water privilege, a stream to\r\nwhich some fall of land just there gave power enough to turn a mill;\r\nand was now a question how they might utilize that power.\r\n\r\nDuring the day just past Clara had been with them, but they were now\r\ntalking of what they would do when she would have left them. This\r\ncreated some little feeling of awkwardness, for Clara had put her\r\nwhole heart into the work at Gortnaclough, and it was evident that\r\nshe would have been so delighted to continue with them.\r\n\r\n"But why on earth need you go home to-morrow, Lady Clara?" said\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I must; mamma expects me, you know."\r\n\r\n"Of course we should send word. Indeed, I must send to Clady\r\nto-morrow, and the man must pass by Desmond Court gate."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, Clara; and you can write a line. It would be such a pity\r\nthat you should not see all about the mill, now that we have talked\r\nit over together. Do tell her to stay, mamma."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I wish she would," said Lady Fitzgerald. "Could not Lady\r\nDesmond manage to spare you for one day?"\r\n\r\n"She is all alone, you know," said Clara, whose heart, however, was\r\nbent on accepting the invitation.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she would come over and join us," said Lady Fitzgerald,\r\nfeeling, however, that the subject was not without danger. Sending a\r\ncarriage for a young girl like Lady Clara did very well, but it might\r\nnot answer if she were to offer to send for the Countess of Desmond.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma never goes out."\r\n\r\n"I\'m quite sure she\'d like you to stay," said Herbert. "After you\r\nwere all gone yesterday, she said how delighted she was to have you\r\ngo away for a little time. And she did say she thought you could not\r\ngo to a better place than Castle Richmond."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that was very kind of her," said Lady Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"Did she?" said Clara, longingly.\r\n\r\nAnd so after a while it was settled that she should send a line to\r\nher mother, saying that she had been persuaded to stay over one other\r\nnight, and that she should accompany them to inspect the site of this\r\nembryo mill at Berryhill.\r\n\r\n"And I will write a line to the countess," said Lady Fitzgerald,\r\n"telling her how impossible it was for you to hold your own intention\r\nwhen we were all attacking you on the other side."\r\n\r\nAnd so the matter was settled.\r\n\r\nOn the following day they were to leave home almost immediately after\r\nbreakfast; and on this occasion Miss Letty insisted on going with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a seat on the car, I know, Herbert," she said; "for you mean\r\nto ride; and I\'m just as much interested about the mill as any of\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid the day would be too long for you, Aunt Letty," said\r\nMary: "we shall stay there, you know, till after four."\r\n\r\n"Not a bit too long. When I\'m tired I shall go into Mrs. Townsend\'s;\r\nthe glebe is not ten minutes\' drive from Berryhill."\r\n\r\nThe Rev. \xc6neas Townsend was the rector of the parish, and he, as\r\nwell as his wife, were fast friends of Aunt Letty. As we get on in\r\nthe story we shall, I trust, become acquainted with the Rev. \xc6neas\r\nTownsend and his wife. It was ultimately found that there was no\r\ngetting rid of Aunt Letty, and so the party was made up.\r\n\r\nThey were all standing about the hall after breakfast, looking up\r\ntheir shawls and cloaks and coats, and Herbert was in the act of\r\ntaking special and very suspicious care of Lady Clara\'s throat, when\r\nthere came a ring at the door. The visitor, whoever he might be, was\r\nnot kept long waiting, for one servant was in the hall, and another\r\njust outside the front door with the car, and a third holding\r\nHerbert\'s horse.\r\n\r\n"I wish to see Sir Thomas," said a man\'s voice as soon as the door\r\nwas opened; and the man entered the hall, and then seeing that it was\r\nfull of ladies, retreated again into the doorway. He was an elderly\r\nman, dressed almost more than well, for there was about him a slight\r\naffectation of dandyism; and though he had for the moment been\r\nabashed, there was about him also a slight swagger. "Good morning,\r\nladies," he said, re-entering again, and bowing to young Herbert, who\r\nstood looking at him; "I believe Sir Thomas is at home; would you\r\nsend your servant in to say that a gentleman wants to see him for a\r\nminute or so, on very particular business? I am a little in a hurry\r\nlike."\r\n\r\nThe door of the drawing-room was ajar, so that Lady Fitzgerald, who\r\nwas sitting there tranquilly in her own seat, could hear the voice.\r\nAnd she did hear it, and knew that some stranger had come to trouble\r\nher husband. But she did not come forth; why should she? was not\r\nHerbert there--if, indeed, even Herbert could be of any service?\r\n\r\n"Shall I take your card in to Sir Thomas, sir?" said one of the\r\nservants, coming forward.\r\n\r\n"Card!" said Mollett senior out loud; "well, if it is necessary,\r\nI believe I have a card." And he took from his pocket a greasy\r\npocket-book, and extracted from it a piece of pasteboard on which\r\nhis name was written. "There; give that to Sir Thomas. I don\'t think\r\nthere\'s much doubt but that he\'ll see me." And then, uninvited, he\r\nsat himself down in one of the hall chairs.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas\'s study, the room in which he himself sat, and in which\r\nindeed he might almost be said to live at present,--for on many days\r\nhe only came out to dine, and then again to go to bed,--was at some\r\nlittle distance to the back of the house, and was approached by\r\na passage from the hall. While the servant was gone, the ladies\r\nfinished their wrapping, and got up on the car.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Clara, laughing, "I shan\'t be able to\r\nbreathe with all that on me."\r\n\r\n"Look at Mary and Emmeline," said he; "they have got twice as much.\r\nYou don\'t know how cold it is."\r\n\r\n"You had better have the fur close to your body," said Aunt Letty;\r\n"look here;" and she showed that her gloves were lined with fur, and\r\nher boots, and that she had gotten some nondescript furry article of\r\nattire stuck in underneath the body of her dress.\r\n\r\n"But you must let me have them a little looser, Mr. Fitzgerald," said\r\nClara; "there, that will do," and then they all got upon the car\r\nand started. Herbert was perhaps two minutes after them before he\r\nmounted; but when he left the hall the man was still sitting there;\r\nfor the servant had not yet come back from his father\'s room.\r\n\r\nBut the clatter of his horse\'s hoofs was still distinct enough at\r\nthe hall door when the servant did come back, and in a serious tone\r\ndesired the stranger to follow him. "Sir Thomas will see you," said\r\nthe servant, putting some stress on the word will.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I did not doubt that the least in the world," said Mr. Mollett,\r\nas he followed the man along the passage.\r\n\r\nThe morning was very cold. There had been rainy weather, but it now\r\nappeared to be a settled frost. The roads were rough and hard, and\r\nthe man who was driving them said a word now and again to his young\r\nmaster as to the expediency of getting frost nails put into the\r\nhorse\'s shoes. "I\'d better go gently, Mr. Herbert; it may be he might\r\ncome down at some of these pitches." So they did go gently, and at\r\nlast arrived safely at Berryhill.\r\n\r\nAnd very busy they were there all day. The inspection of the site\r\nfor the mill was not their only employment. Here also was an\r\nestablishment for distributing food, and a crowd of poor half-fed\r\nwretches were there to meet them. Not that at that time things\r\nwere so bad as they became afterwards. Men were not dying on the\r\nroad-side, nor as yet had the apathy of want produced its terrible\r\ncure for the agony of hunger. The time had not yet come when the\r\nfamished living skeletons might be seen to reject the food which\r\ncould no longer serve to prolong their lives.\r\n\r\nThough this had not come as yet, the complaints of the women\r\nwith their throngs of children were bitter enough; and it was\r\nheart-breaking too to hear the men declare that they had worked like\r\nhorses, and that it was hard upon them now to see their children\r\nstarve like dogs. For in this earlier part of the famine the people\r\ndid not seem to realize the fact that this scarcity and want had come\r\nfrom God. Though they saw the potatoes rotting in their own gardens,\r\nunder their own eyes, they still seemed to think that the rich men of\r\nthe land could stay the famine if they would; that the fault was with\r\nthem; that the famine could be put down if the rich would but stir\r\nthemselves to do it. Before it was over they were well aware that no\r\nhuman power could suffice to put it down. Nay, more than that; they\r\nhad almost begun to doubt the power of God to bring back better days.\r\n\r\nThey strove, and toiled, and planned, and hoped at Berryhill that\r\nday. And infinite was the good that was done by such efforts as\r\nthese. That they could not hinder God\'s work we all know; but much\r\nthey did do to lessen the sufferings around, and many were the lives\r\nthat were thus saved.\r\n\r\nThey were all standing behind the counter of a small store that had\r\nbeen hired in the village--the three girls at least, for Aunt Letty\r\nhad already gone to the glebe, and Herbert was still down at the\r\n"water privilege," talking to a millwright and a carpenter. This was\r\na place at which Indian corn flour, that which after a while was\r\ngenerally termed "meal" in those famine days, was sold to the poor.\r\nAt this period much of it was absolutely given away. This plan,\r\nhowever, was soon found to be injurious; for hundreds would get it\r\nwho were not absolutely in want, and would then sell it;--for the\r\nfamine by no means improved the morals of the people.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore it was found better to sell the flour; to sell it at a\r\ncheap rate, considerably less sometimes than the cost price; and to\r\nput the means of buying it into the hands of the people by giving\r\nthem work, and paying them wages. Towards the end of these times,\r\nwhen the full weight of the blow was understood, and the subject had\r\nbeen in some sort studied, the general rule was thus to sell the meal\r\nat its true price, hindering the exorbitant profit of hucksters by\r\nthe use of large stores, and to require that all those who could\r\nnot buy it should seek the means of living within the walls of\r\nworkhouses. The regular established workhouses,--unions as they were\r\ncalled,--were not as yet numerous, but supernumerary houses were\r\nprovided in every town, and were crowded from the cellars to the\r\nroofs.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be explained that no general rule could be established\r\nand acted upon at once. The numbers to be dealt with were so great,\r\nthat the exceptions to all rules were overwhelming. But such and\r\nsuch like were the efforts made, and these efforts ultimately were\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe three girls were standing behind the counter of a little store\r\nwhich Sir Thomas had hired at Berryhill, when a woman came into the\r\nplace with two children in her arms and followed by four others of\r\ndifferent ages. She was a gaunt tall creature, with sunken cheeks and\r\nhollow eyes, and her clothes hung about her in unintelligible rags.\r\nThere was a crowd before the counter, for those who had been answered\r\nor served stood staring at the three ladies, and could hardly be got\r\nto go away; but this woman pressed her way through, pushing some and\r\nusing harsh language to others, till she stood immediately opposite\r\nto Clara.\r\n\r\n"Look at that, madam," she cried, undoing an old handkerchief which\r\nshe held in her hand, and displaying the contents on the counter; "is\r\nthat what the likes of you calls food for poor people? is that fit\r\n\'ating to give to children? Would any av ye put such stuff as that\r\ninto the stomachs of your own bairns?" and she pointed to the mess\r\nwhich lay revealed upon the handkerchief.\r\n\r\nThe food, as food, was not nice to look at; and could not have been\r\nnice to eat, or probably easy of digestion when eaten.\r\n\r\n"Feel of that." And the woman rubbed her forefinger among it to show\r\nthat it was rough and hard, and that the particles were as sharp as\r\nthough sand had been mixed with it. The stuff was half-boiled Indian\r\nmeal, which had been improperly subjected at first to the full heat\r\nof boiling water; and in its present state was bad food either for\r\nchildren or grown people. "Feel of that," said the woman; "would you\r\nlike to be \'ating that yourself now?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you have cooked it quite enough," said Clara, looking\r\ninto the woman\'s face, half with fear and half with pity, and\r\nputting, as she spoke, her pretty delicate finger down into the nasty\r\ndaubed mess of parboiled yellow flour.\r\n\r\n"Cooked it!" said the woman scornfully. "All the cooking on \'arth\r\nwouldn\'t make food of that fit for a Christian--feel of the roughness\r\nof it"--and she turned to another woman who stood near her; "would\r\nyou like to be putting sharp points like that into your children\'s\r\nbellies?"\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that the grains of it were hard and sharp, so as to\r\ngive one an idea that it would make good eating neither for women nor\r\nchildren. The millers and dealers, who of course made their profits\r\nin these times, did frequently grind up the whole corn without\r\nseparating the grain from the husks, and the shell of a grain of\r\nIndian corn does not, when ground, become soft flour. This woman had\r\nreason for her complaints, as had many thousands reason for similar\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be throubling the ladies, Kitty," said an old man standing by;\r\n"sure and weren\'t you glad enough to be getting it."\r\n\r\n"She\'d be axing the ladies to go home wid her and cook it for her\r\nafter giving it her," said another.\r\n\r\n"Who says it war guv\' me?" said the angry mother. "Didn\'t I buy it,\r\nhere at this counter, with Mike\'s own hard-\'arned money? and it\'s\r\nchaiting us they are. Give me back my money." And she looked at Clara\r\nas though she meant to attack her across the counter.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald is going to put up a mill of his own, and then the\r\ncorn will be better ground," said Emmeline Fitzgerald, deprecating\r\nthe woman\'s wrath.\r\n\r\n"Put up a mill!" said the woman, still in scorn. "Are you going to\r\ngive me back my money; or food that my poor bairns can ate?"\r\n\r\nThis individual little difficulty was ended by a donation to the\r\nangry woman of another lot of meal, in taking away which she was\r\ncareful not to leave behind her the mess which she had brought in her\r\nhandkerchief. But she expressed no thanks on being so treated.\r\n\r\nThe hardest burden which had to be borne by those who exerted\r\nthemselves at this period was the ingratitude of the poor for whom\r\nthey worked;--or rather I should say thanklessness. To call them\r\nungrateful would imply too deep a reproach, for their convictions\r\nwere that they were being ill used by the upper classes. When they\r\nreceived bad meal which they could not cook, and even in their\r\nextreme hunger could hardly eat half-cooked; when they were desired\r\nto leave their cabins and gardens, and flock into the wretched\r\nbarracks which were prepared for them; when they saw their children\r\nwasting away under a suddenly altered system of diet, it would have\r\nbeen unreasonable to expect that they should have been grateful.\r\nGrateful for what? Had they not at any rate a right to claim life,\r\nto demand food that should keep them and their young ones alive? But\r\nnot the less was it a hard task for delicate women to work hard, and\r\nto feel that all their work was unappreciated by those whom they so\r\nthoroughly commiserated, whose sufferings they were so anxious to\r\nrelieve.\r\n\r\nIt was almost dark before they left Berryhill, and then they had to\r\ngo out of their way to pick up Aunt Letty at Mr. Townsend\'s house.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t go in whatever you do, girls," said Herbert; "we should never\r\nget away."\r\n\r\n"Indeed we won\'t unpack ourselves again before we get home; will we,\r\nClara?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not. I\'m very nice now, and so warm. But, Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\nis not Mrs. Townsend very queer?"\r\n\r\n"Very queer indeed. But you mustn\'t say a word about her before Aunt\r\nLetty. They are sworn brothers-in-arms."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t of course. But, Mr. Fitzgerald, she\'s very good, is she\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, in her way. Only it\'s a pity she\'s so prejudiced."\r\n\r\n"You mean about religion?"\r\n\r\n"I mean about everything. If she wears a bonnet on her head, she\'ll\r\nthink you very wicked because you wear a hat."\r\n\r\n"Will she? what a very funny woman! But, Mr. Fitzgerald, I shan\'t\r\ngive up my hat, let her say what she will."\r\n\r\n"I should rather think not."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Townsend? we know him a little; he\'s very good too, isn\'t\r\nhe?"\r\n\r\n"Do you mean me to answer you truly, or to answer you according to\r\nthe good-natured idea of never saying any ill of one\'s neighbour?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, both; if you can."\r\n\r\n"Oh both; must I? Well, then, I think him good as a man, but bad as a\r\nclergyman."\r\n\r\n"But I thought he worked so very hard as a clergyman?"\r\n\r\n"So he does. But if he works evil rather than good, you can\'t call\r\nhim a good clergyman. Mind, you would have my opinion; and if I talk\r\ntreason and heterodoxy and infidelity and papistry, you must only\r\ntake it for what it\'s worth."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you won\'t talk infidelity."\r\n\r\n"Nor yet treason; and then, moreover, Mr. Townsend would be so much\r\nbetter a clergyman, to my way of thinking, if he would sometimes\r\nbrush his hair, and occasionally put on a clean surplice. But,\r\nremember, not a word of all this to Aunt Letty."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no; of course not."\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend did come out of the house on the little sweep before\r\nthe door to help Miss Letty up on the car, though it was dark and\r\npiercingly cold.\r\n\r\n"Well, young ladies, and won\'t you come in now and warm yourselves?"\r\n\r\nThey all of course deprecated any such idea, and declared that they\r\nwere already much too late.\r\n\r\n"Richard, mind you take care going down Ballydahan Hill," said the\r\nparson, giving a not unnecessary caution to the servant. "I came up\r\nit just now, and it was one sheet of ice."\r\n\r\n"Now, Richard, do be careful," said Miss Letty.\r\n\r\n"Never fear, miss," said Richard.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll take care of you," said Herbert. "You\'re not frightened, Lady\r\nClara, are you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," said Clara; and so they started.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark and very cold, and there was a sharp hard frost.\r\nBut the lamps of the car were lighted, and the horse seemed to be on\r\nhis mettle, for he did his work well. Ballydahan Hill was not above\r\na mile from the glebe, and descending that, Richard, by his young\r\nmaster\'s orders, got down from his seat and went to the animal\'s\r\nhead. Herbert also himself got off, and led his horse down the hill.\r\nAt first the girls were a little inclined to be frightened, and\r\nMiss Letty found herself obliged to remind them that they couldn\'t\r\nmelt the frost by screaming. But they all got safely down, and were\r\nsoon chattering as fast as though they were already safe in the\r\ndrawing-room of Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\nThey went on without any accident, till they reached a turn in the\r\nroad, about two miles from home; and there, all in a moment, quite\r\nsuddenly, when nobody was thinking about the frost or the danger,\r\ndown came the poor horse on his side, his feet having gone quite from\r\nunder him, and a dreadful cracking sound of broken timber gave notice\r\nthat a shaft was smashed. A shaft at least was smashed; if only no\r\nother harm was done!\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be that Herbert Fitzgerald cared more for such a\r\nstranger as Lady Clara Desmond than he did for his own sisters and\r\naunt; but nevertheless, it was to Lady Clara\'s assistance that he\r\nfirst betook himself. Perhaps he had seen, or fancied that he saw,\r\nthat she had fallen with the greatest violence.\r\n\r\n"Speak, speak," said he, as he jumped from his horse close to her\r\nside. "Are you hurt? do speak to me." And going down on his knees on\r\nthe hard ground, he essayed to lift her in his arms.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, oh dear!" said she. "No; I am not hurt; at least I think\r\nnot--only just my arm a very little. Where is Emmeline? Is Emmeline\r\nhurt?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Emmeline, picking herself up. "But, oh dear, dear, I\'ve\r\nlost my muff, and I\'ve spoiled my hat! Where are Mary and Aunt\r\nLetty?"\r\n\r\nAfter some considerable confusion it was found that nothing was much\r\ndamaged except the car, one shaft of which was broken altogether in\r\ntwo. Lady Clara\'s arm was bruised and rather sore, but the three\r\nother ladies had altogether escaped. The quantity of clothes that had\r\nbeen wrapped round them had no doubt enabled them to fall softly.\r\n\r\n"And what about the horse, Richard?" asked young Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t come upon his knees at all at all, Master Herbert," said\r\nRichard, scrutinizing the animal\'s legs with the car lamp in his\r\nhand. "I don\'t think he\'s a taste the worse. But the car, Master\r\nHerbert, is clane smashed."\r\n\r\nSuch being found to be undoubtedly the fact, there was nothing for\r\nit but that the ladies should walk home. Herbert again forgot that\r\nthe age of his aunt imperatively demanded all the assistance that he\r\ncould lend her, and with many lamentations that fortune and the frost\r\nshould have used her so cruelly, he gave his arm to Clara.\r\n\r\n"But do think of Miss Fitzgerald," said Clara, speaking gently into\r\nhis ear.\r\n\r\n"Who? oh, my aunt. Aunt Letty never cares for anybody\'s arm; she\r\nalways prefers walking alone."\r\n\r\n"Fie, Mr. Fitzgerald, fie! It is impossible to believe such an\r\nassertion as that." And yet Clara did seem to believe it; for she\r\ntook his proffered arm without further objection.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven when they reached the hall door, and at that\r\ntime they had all forgotten the misfortune of the car in the fun of\r\nthe dark frosty walk home. Herbert had found a boy to lead his horse,\r\nand Richard was of course left with the ruins in the road.\r\n\r\n"And how\'s your arm now?" asked Herbert, tenderly, as they entered in\r\nunder the porch.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it does not hurt me hardly at all. I don\'t mind it in the\r\nleast." And then the door was opened for them.\r\n\r\nThey all flocked into the hall, and there they were met by Lady\r\nFitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mamma," said Mary, "I know you\'re quite frightened out of your\r\nlife! But there\'s nothing the matter. The horse tumbled down; but\r\nthere\'s nobody hurt."\r\n\r\n"And we had to walk home from the turn to Ballyclough," said\r\nEmmeline. "But, oh mamma, what\'s the matter?" They all now looked up\r\nat Lady Fitzgerald, and it was evident enough that something was the\r\nmatter; something to be thought of infinitely more than that accident\r\non the road.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mary, Mary, what is it?" said Aunt Letty, coming forward and\r\ntaking hold of her sister-in-law\'s hand. "Is my brother ill?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Thomas is not very well, and I\'ve been waiting for you so long.\r\nWhere\'s Herbert? I must speak to Herbert." And then the mother and\r\nson left the hall together.\r\n\r\nThere was then a silence among the four ladies that were left there\r\nstanding. At first they followed each other into the drawing-room,\r\nall wrapped up as they were and sat on chairs apart, saying nothing\r\nto each other. At last Aunt Letty got up.\r\n\r\n"You had better go up-stairs with Lady Clara," said she; "I will go\r\nto your mamma."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunt Letty, do send us word; pray send us word," said Emmeline.\r\n\r\nMary now began to cry. "I know he\'s very ill. I\'m sure he\'s very ill.\r\nOh, what shall we do?"\r\n\r\n"You had better go up stairs with Lady Clara," said Aunt Letty. "I\r\nwill send you up word immediately."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t mind me; pray don\'t mind me," said Clara. "Pray, pray,\r\ndon\'t take notice of me;" and she rushed forward, and throwing\r\nherself on her knees before Emmeline, began to kiss her.\r\n\r\nThey remained here, heedless of Aunt Letty\'s advice, for some ten\r\nminutes, and then Herbert came to them. The two girls flew at him\r\nwith questions; while Lady Clara stood by the window, anxious to\r\nlearn, but unwilling to thrust herself into their family matters.\r\n\r\n"My father has been much troubled to-day, and is not well," said\r\nHerbert. "But I do not think there is anything to frighten us. Come;\r\nlet us go to dinner."\r\n\r\nThe going to dinner was but a sorry farce with any of them; but\r\nnevertheless, they went through the ceremony, each for the sake of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n"Mayn\'t we see him?" said the girls to their mother, who did come\r\ndown into the drawing-room for one moment to speak to Clara.\r\n\r\n"Not to-night, loves. He should not be disturbed." And so that day\r\ncame to an end; not satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFAMILY COUNCILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the girls and Aunt Letty went to their chambers that night,\r\nHerbert returned to his mother\'s own dressing-room, and there, seated\r\nover the fire with her, discussed the matter of his father\'s sudden\r\nattack. He had been again with his father, and Sir Thomas had seemed\r\nglad to have him there; but now he had left him for the night.\r\n\r\n"He will sleep now, mother," said the son; "he has taken laudanum."\r\n\r\n"I fear he takes that too often now."\r\n\r\n"It was good for him to have it to-night. He did not get too much,\r\nfor I dropped it for him." And then they sat silent for a few moments\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Herbert, "who can this man have been?"\r\n\r\n"I have no knowledge--no idea--no guess even," said Lady Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"It is that man\'s visit that has upset him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly. I think there is no doubt of that. I was waiting for\r\nthe man to go, and went in almost before he was out of the house."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"And I found your father quite prostrated."\r\n\r\n"Not on the floor?"\r\n\r\n"No, not exactly on the floor. He was still seated on his chair, but\r\nhis head was on the table, over his arms."\r\n\r\n"I have often found him in that way, mother."\r\n\r\n"But you never saw him looking as he looked this morning, Herbert.\r\nWhen I went in he was speechless, and he remained so, I should say,\r\nfor some minutes."\r\n\r\n"Was he senseless?"\r\n\r\n"No; he knew me well enough, and grasped me by the hand; and when I\r\nwould have gone to the bell to ring for assistance, he would not let\r\nme. I thought he would have gone into a fit when I attempted it."\r\n\r\n"And what did you do?"\r\n\r\n"I sat there by him, with his hand in mine, quite quietly. And then\r\nhe uttered a long, deep sigh, and--oh, Herbert!"\r\n\r\n"Well, mother?"\r\n\r\n"At last, he burst into a flood of tears, and sobbed and cried like a\r\nchild."\r\n\r\n"Mother!"\r\n\r\n"He did, so that it was piteous to see him. But it did him good, for\r\nhe was better after it. And all the time he never let go my hand, but\r\nheld it and kissed it. And then he took me by the waist, and kissed\r\nme, oh, so often. And all the while his tears were running like the\r\ntears of a girl." And Lady Fitzgerald, as she told the story, could\r\nnot herself refrain from weeping.\r\n\r\n"And did he say anything afterwards about this man?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; not at first, that is. Of course I asked him who he was as soon\r\nas I thought he could bear the question. But he turned away, and\r\nmerely said that he was a stupid man about some old London business,\r\nand that he should have gone to Prendergast. But when, after a while,\r\nI pressed him, he said that the man\'s name was Mollett, and that he\r\nhad, or pretended to have, some claim upon the city property."\r\n\r\n"A claim on the city property! Why, it\'s not seven hundred a year\r\naltogether. If any Mollett could run away with it all, that loss\r\nwould not affect him like that."\r\n\r\n"So I said, Herbert; not exactly in those words, but trying to\r\ncomfort him. He then put it off by declaring that it was the\r\nconsciousness of his inability to see any one on business which\r\naffected him so grievously."\r\n\r\n"It was that he said to me."\r\n\r\n"And there may be something in that, Herbert."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but then what should make him so weak, to begin with? If you\r\nremember, mother, he was very well,--more like himself than usual\r\nlast night."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I observed it. He seemed to like having Clara Desmond there."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t he, mother? I observed that too. But then Clara Desmond is\r\nsuch a sweet creature." The mother looked at her son as he said this,\r\nbut the son did not notice the look. "I do wonder what the real truth\r\ncan be," he continued. "Do you think there is anything wrong about\r\nthe property in general? About this estate, here?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t think that," said the mother, sadly.\r\n\r\n"What can it be then?" But Lady Fitzgerald sat there, and did not\r\nanswer the question. "I\'ll tell you what I will do, mother; I\'ll go\r\nup to London, and see Prendergast, and consult him."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; you mustn\'t do that. I am wrong to tell you all this, for he\r\ntold me to talk to no one. But it would kill me if I didn\'t speak of\r\nit to you."\r\n\r\n"All the same, mother, I think it would be best to consult\r\nPrendergast."\r\n\r\n"Not yet, Herbert. I dare say Mr. Prendergast may be a very good sort\r\nof man, but we none of us know him. And if, as is very probable, this\r\nis only an affair of health, it would be wrong in you to go to a\r\nstranger. It might look--"\r\n\r\n"Look what, mother?"\r\n\r\n"People might think--he, I mean--that you wanted to interfere."\r\n\r\n"But who ought to interfere on his behalf if I don\'t?"\r\n\r\n"Quite true, dearest; I understand what you mean, and know how good\r\nyou are. But perhaps Mr. Prendergast might not. He might think you\r\nwanted--"\r\n\r\n"Wanted what, mother? I don\'t understand you."\r\n\r\n"Wanted to take the things out of your father\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother!"\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t know you. And, what is more, I don\'t think he knows much\r\nof your father. Don\'t go to him yet." And Herbert promised that he\r\nwould not.\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t think that this man was ever here before?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Well, I rather think he was here once before; many years ago--soon\r\nafter you went to school."\r\n\r\n"So long ago as that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; not that I remember him, or, indeed, ever knew of his coming\r\nthen, if he did come. But Jones says that she thinks she remembers\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Did Jones see him now?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; she was in the hall as he passed through on his way out. And it\r\nso happened that she let him in and out too when he came before. That\r\nis, if it is the same man."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very odd."\r\n\r\n"It did not happen here. We were at Tenby for a few weeks in the\r\nsummer."\r\n\r\n"I remember; you went there with the girls just when I went back to\r\nschool."\r\n\r\n"Jones was with us, and Richard. We had none other of our own\r\nservants. And Jones says that the same man did come then; that he\r\nstayed with your father for an hour or two; and that when he left,\r\nyour father was depressed--almost as he was yesterday. I well\r\nremember that. I know that a man did come to him at Tenby; and--oh,\r\nHerbert!"\r\n\r\n"What is it, mother? Speak out at any rate to me."\r\n\r\n"Since that man came to him at Tenby he has never been like what he\r\nwas before."\r\n\r\nAnd then there was more questioning between them about Jones and her\r\nremembrances. It must be explained that Jones was a very old and very\r\nvalued servant. She had originally been brought up as a child by Mrs.\r\nWainwright, in that Dorsetshire parsonage, and had since remained\r\nfirm to the fortunes of the young lady, whose maid she had become on\r\nher first marriage. As her mistress had been promoted, so had Jones.\r\nAt first she had been Kitty to all the world, now she was Mrs. Jones\r\nto the world at large, Jones to Sir Thomas and her mistress and\r\nof late years to Herbert, and known by all manner of affectionate\r\nsobriquets to the young ladies. Sometimes they would call her\r\nJohnny, and sometimes the Duchess; but doubtless they and Mrs. Jones\r\nthoroughly understood each other. By the whole establishment Mrs.\r\nJones was held in great respect, and by the younger portion in\r\nextreme awe. Her breakfast and tea she had in a little sitting-room\r\nby herself; but the solitude of this was too tremendous for her\r\nto endure at dinner-time. At that meal she sat at the head of the\r\ntable in the servants\' hall, though she never troubled herself to\r\ncarve anything except puddings and pies, for which she had a great\r\npartiality, and of which she was supposed to be the most undoubted\r\nand severe judge known of anywhere in that part of the country.\r\n\r\nShe was supposed by all her brother and sister servants to be a very\r\nCroesus for wealth; and wondrous tales were told of the money she\r\nhad put by. But as she was certainly honest, and supposed to be very\r\ngenerous to certain poor relations in Dorsetshire, some of these\r\nstories were probably mythic. It was known, however, as a fact, that\r\ntwo Castle Richmond butlers, one out-door steward, three neighbouring\r\nfarmers, and one wickedly ambitious coachman, had endeavoured to\r\ntempt her to matrimony--in vain. "She didn\'t want none of them," she\r\ntold her mistress. "And, what was more, she wouldn\'t have none of\r\nthem." And therefore she remained Mrs. Jones, with brevet rank.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, from what Lady Fitzgerald said, that Mrs. Jones\'s manner\r\nhad been somewhat mysterious about this man, Mollett. She had\r\nendeavoured to reassure and comfort her mistress, saying that nothing\r\nwould come of it as nothing had come of that other Tenby visit, and\r\ngiving it as her counsel that the ladies should allow the whole\r\nmatter to pass by without further notice. But at the same time Lady\r\nFitzgerald had remarked that her manner had been very serious when\r\nshe first said that she had seen the man before.\r\n\r\n"Jones," Lady Fitzgerald had said to her, very earnestly, "if you\r\nknow more about this man than you are telling me, you are bound to\r\nspeak out, and let me know everything."\r\n\r\n"Who--I, my lady? what could I know? Only he do look to me like the\r\nsame man, and so I thought it right to say to your ladyship."\r\n\r\nLady Fitzgerald had seen that there was nothing more to be gained by\r\ncross-questioning, and so she had allowed the matter to drop. But she\r\nwas by no means satisfied that this servant whom she so trusted did\r\nnot know more than she had told. And then Mrs. Jones had been with\r\nher in those dreadful Dorsetshire days, and an undefined fear began\r\nto creep over her very soul.\r\n\r\n"God bless you, my child!" said Lady Fitzgerald, as her son got up to\r\nleave her. And then she embraced him with more warmth even than was\r\nher wont. "All that we can do at present is to be gentle with him,\r\nand not to encourage people around him to talk of his illness."\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Lady Fitzgerald did not come down to breakfast,\r\nbut sent her love to Clara, and begged her guest to excuse her on\r\naccount of headache. Sir Thomas rarely came in to breakfast, and\r\ntherefore his absence was not remarkable. His daughters, however,\r\nwent up to see him, as did also his sister; and they all declared\r\nthat he was very much better.\r\n\r\n"It was some sudden attack, I suppose?" said Clara.\r\n\r\n"Yes, very sudden; he has had the same before," said Herbert. "But\r\nthey do not at all affect his intellect or bodily powers. Depression\r\nis, I suppose, the name that the doctors would call it."\r\n\r\nAnd then at last it became noticeable by them that Lady Clara did not\r\nuse her left arm. "Oh, Clara!" said Emmeline, "I see now that you are\r\nhurt. How selfish we have been! Oh dear, oh dear!" And both Emmeline\r\nand Mary immediately surrounded her, examining her arm, and almost\r\ncarrying her to the sofa.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it will be much," said Clara. "It\'s only a little\r\nstiff."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Herbert, what shall we do? Do look here; the inside of her arm\r\nis quite black."\r\n\r\nHerbert, gently touching her hand, did examine the arm, and declared\r\nhis opinion that she had received a dreadfully violent blow. Emmeline\r\nproposed to send for a doctor to pronounce whether or no it were\r\nbroken. Mary said that she didn\'t think it was broken, but that she\r\nwas sure the patient ought not to be moved that day, or probably for\r\na week. Aunt Letty, in the mean time, prescribed a cold-water bandage\r\nwith great authority, and bounced out of the room to fetch the\r\nnecessary linen and basin of water.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nothing at all," continued Clara. "And indeed I shall go home\r\nto-day; indeed I shall."\r\n\r\n"It might be very bad for your arm that you should be moved," said\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n"And your staying here will not be the least trouble to us. We shall\r\nall be so happy to have you; shall we not, Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Of course we shall; and so will mamma."\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry to be here now," said Clara, "when I know you are all\r\nin such trouble about Sir Thomas. But as for going, I shall go as\r\nsoon as ever you can make it convenient to send me. Indeed I shall."\r\nAnd so the matter was discussed between them, Aunt Letty in the mean\r\ntime binding up the bruised arm with cold-water appliances.\r\n\r\nLady Clara was quite firm about going, and, therefore, at about\r\ntwelve she was sent. I should say taken, for Emmeline insisted on\r\ngoing with her in the carriage. Herbert would have gone also, but he\r\nfelt that he ought not to leave Castle Richmond that day, on account\r\nof his father. But he would certainly ride over, he said, and learn\r\nhow her arm was the next morning.\r\n\r\n"And about Clady, you know," said Clara.\r\n\r\n"I will go on to Clady also. I did send a man there yesterday to see\r\nabout the flue. It\'s the flue that\'s wrong, I know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you; I am so much obliged to you," said Clara. And then\r\nthe carriage drove off, and Herbert returned into the morning\r\nsitting-room with his sister Mary.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what it is, Master Herbert," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Well--what is it?"\r\n\r\n"You are going to fall in love with her young ladyship."\r\n\r\n"Am I? Is that all you know about it? And who are you going to fall\r\nin love with pray?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! his young lordship, perhaps; only he ought to be about ten years\r\nolder, so that I\'m afraid that wouldn\'t do. But Clara is just the age\r\nfor you. It really seems as though it were all prepared ready to your\r\nhand."\r\n\r\n"You girls always do think that those things are ready prepared;"\r\nand so saying, Herbert walked off with great manly dignity to some\r\nretreat among his own books and papers, there to meditate whether\r\nthis thing were in truth prepared for him. It certainly was the fact\r\nthat the house did seem very blank to him now that Clara was gone;\r\nand that he looked forward with impatience to the visit which it was\r\nso necessary that he should make on the following day to Clady.\r\n\r\nThe house at Castle Richmond was very silent and quiet that day. When\r\nEmmeline came back, she and her sister remained together. Nothing had\r\nbeen said to them about Mollett\'s visit, and they had no other idea\r\nthan that this lowness of spirits on their father\'s part, to which\r\nthey had gradually become accustomed, had become worse and more\r\ndangerous to his health than ever.\r\n\r\nAunt Letty talked much about it to Herbert, to Lady Fitzgerald,\r\nto Jones, and to her brother, and was quite certain that she had\r\npenetrated to the depth of the whole matter. That nasty city\r\nproperty, she said, which had come with her grandmother, had always\r\ngiven the family more trouble than it was worth. Indeed, her\r\ngrandmother had been a very troublesome woman altogether; and no\r\nwonder, for though she was a Protestant herself, she had had Papist\r\nrelations in Lancashire. She distinctly remembered to have heard that\r\nthere was some flaw in the title of that property, and she knew that\r\nit was very hard to get some of the tenants to pay any rent. That she\r\nhad always heard. She was quite sure that this man was some person\r\nlaying a claim to it, and threatening to prosecute his claim at law.\r\nIt was a thousand pities that her brother should allow such a trifle\r\nas this,--for after all it was but a trifle, to fret his spirits and\r\nworry him in this way. But it was the wretched state of his health:\r\nwere he once himself again, all such annoyances as that would pass\r\nhim by like the wind.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that Aunt Letty\'s memory in this respect was\r\nnot exactly correct; for, as it happened, Sir Thomas held his little\r\nproperty in the city of London by as firm a tenure as the laws and\r\ncustoms of his country could give him; and seeing that his income\r\nthence arising came from ground rents near the river, on which\r\nproperty stood worth some hundreds of thousands, it was not very\r\nprobable that his tenants should be in arrear. But what she said had\r\nsome effect upon Herbert. He was not quite sure whether this might\r\nnot be the cause of his father\'s grief; and if the story did not have\r\nmuch effect upon Lady Fitzgerald, at any rate it did as well as any\r\nother to exercise the ingenuity and affection of Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas passed the whole of that day in his own room; but during a\r\ngreat portion of the day either his wife, or sister, or son was with\r\nhim. They endeavoured not to leave him alone with his own thoughts,\r\nfeeling conscious that something preyed upon his mind, though\r\nignorant as to what that something might be.\r\n\r\nHe was quite aware of the nature of their thoughts; perfectly\r\nconscious of the judgment they had formed respecting him. He knew\r\nthat he was subjecting himself, in the eyes not only of his own\r\nfamily but of all those around him, to suspicions which must be\r\ninjurious to him, and yet he could not shake off the feeling that\r\ndepressed him.\r\n\r\nBut at last he did resolve to make an attempt at doing so. For some\r\ntime in the evening he was altogether alone, and he then strove to\r\nforce his mind to work upon the matter which occupied it,--to arrange\r\nhis ideas, and bring himself into a state in which he could make a\r\nresolution. For hours he had sat,--not thinking upon this subject,\r\nfor thought is an exertion which requires a combination of ideas and\r\nresults in the deducing of conclusions from premises; and no such\r\neffort as that had he hitherto made,--but endeavouring to think while\r\nhe allowed the matter of his grief to lie ever before his mind\'s eye.\r\n\r\nHe had said to himself over and over again, that it behoved him to\r\nmake some great effort to shake off this incubus that depressed him;\r\nbut yet no such effort had hitherto been even attempted. Now at last\r\nhe arose and shook himself, and promised to himself that he would be\r\na man. It might be that the misfortune under which he groaned was\r\nheavy, but let one\'s sorrow be what it may, there is always a better\r\nand a worse way of meeting it. Let what trouble may fall on a man\'s\r\nshoulders, a man may always bear it manfully. And are not troubles\r\nwhen so borne half cured? It is the flinching from pain which makes\r\npain so painful.\r\n\r\nThis truth came home to him as he sat there that day, thinking what\r\nhe should do, endeavouring to think in what way he might best turn\r\nhimself. But there was this that was especially grievous to him,\r\nthat he had no friend whom he might consult in this matter. It was\r\na sorrow, the cause of which he could not explain to his own family,\r\nand in all other troubles he had sought assistance and looked\r\nfor counsel there and there only. He had had one best, steadiest,\r\ndearest, truest counsellor, and now it had come to pass that things\r\nwere so placed that in this great trouble he could not go to her.\r\n\r\nAnd now a friend was so necessary to him! He felt that he was not fit\r\nto judge how he himself should act in this terrible emergency; that\r\nit was absolutely necessary for him that he should allow himself to\r\nbe guided by some one else. But to whom should he appeal?\r\n\r\n"He is a cold man," said he to himself, as one name did occur to him,\r\n"very cold, almost unfeeling; but he is honest and just." And then\r\nagain he sat and thought. "Yes, he is honest and just; and what\r\nshould I want better than honesty and justice?" And then, shuddering\r\nas he resolved, he did resolve that he would send for this honest and\r\njust man. He would send for him; or, perhaps better still, go to him.\r\nAt any rate, he would tell him the whole truth of his grief, and then\r\nact as the cold, just man should bid him.\r\n\r\nBut he need not do this yet--not quite yet. So at least he said to\r\nhimself, falsely. If a man decide with a fixed decision that his\r\ntooth should come out, or his leg be cut off, let the tooth come out\r\nor the leg be cut off on the earliest possible opportunity. It is the\r\nflinching from such pain that is so grievously painful.\r\n\r\nBut it was something to have brought his mind to bear with a fixed\r\npurpose upon these things, and to have resolved upon what he would\r\ndo, though he still lacked strength to put his resolution immediately\r\nto the proof.\r\n\r\nThen, later in the evening, his son came and sat with him, and he\r\nwas able in some sort to declare that the worst of that evil day had\r\npassed from him. "I shall breakfast with you all to-morrow," he said,\r\nand as he spoke a faint smile passed across his face.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I hope you will," said Herbert; "we shall be so delighted: but,\r\nfather, do not exert yourself too soon."\r\n\r\n"It will do me good, I think."\r\n\r\n"I am sure it will, if the fatigue be not too much."\r\n\r\n"The truth is, Herbert, I have allowed this feeling to grow upon me\r\ntill I have become weak under it. I know that I ought to make an\r\nexertion to throw it off, and it is possible that I may succeed."\r\n\r\nHerbert muttered some few hopeful words, but he found it very\r\ndifficult to know what he ought to say. That his father had some\r\nsecret he was quite sure; and it is hard to talk to a man about his\r\nsecret, without knowing what that secret is.\r\n\r\n"I have allowed myself to fall into a weak state," continued Sir\r\nThomas, speaking slowly, "while by proper exertion I might have\r\navoided it."\r\n\r\n"You have been very ill, father," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have been ill, very ill, certainly. But I do not know that\r\nany doctor could have helped me."\r\n\r\n"Father--"\r\n\r\n"No, Herbert; do not ask me questions; do not inquire; at any rate,\r\nnot at present. I will endeavour--now at least I will endeavour--to\r\ndo my duty. But do not urge me by questions, or appear to notice me\r\nif I am infirm."\r\n\r\n"But, father,--if we could comfort you?"\r\n\r\n"Ah! if you could. But, never mind, I will endeavour to shake off\r\nthis depression. And, Herbert, comfort your mother; do not let her\r\nthink much of all this, if it can be helped."\r\n\r\n"But how can it be helped?"\r\n\r\n"And tell her this: there is a matter that troubles my mind."\r\n\r\n"Is it about the property, father?"\r\n\r\n"No--yes; it certainly is about the property in one sense."\r\n\r\n"Then do not heed it; we shall none of us heed it. Who has so good a\r\nright to say so as I?"\r\n\r\n"Bless you, my darling boy! But, Herbert, such things must be\r\nheeded--more or less, you know: but you may tell your mother this,\r\nand perhaps it may comfort her. I have made up my mind to go to\r\nLondon and to see Prendergast; I will explain the whole of this thing\r\nto him, and as he bids me so will I act."\r\n\r\nThis was thought to be satisfactory to a certain extent both by the\r\nmother and son. They would have been better pleased had he opened\r\nhis heart to them and told them everything; but that it was clear he\r\ncould not bring himself to do. This Mr. Prendergast they had heard\r\nwas a good man; and in his present state it was better that he should\r\nseek counsel of any man than allow his sorrow to feed upon himself\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE RECTOR OF DRUMBARROW AND HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald, in speaking of the Rev. \xc6neas Townsend to Lady\r\nClara Desmond, had said that in his opinion the reverend gentleman\r\nwas a good man, but a bad clergyman. But there were not a few in the\r\ncounty Cork who would have said just the reverse, and declared him\r\nto be a bad man, but a good clergyman. There were others, indeed,\r\nwho knew him well, who would have declared him to be perfect in both\r\nrespects, and others again who thought him in both respects to be\r\nvery bad. Amidst these great diversities of opinion I will venture on\r\nnone of my own, but will attempt to describe him.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland stanch Protestantism consists too much in a hatred of\r\nPapistry--in that rather than in a hatred of those errors against\r\nwhich we Protestants are supposed to protest. Hence the cross--which\r\nshould, I presume, be the emblem of salvation to us all--creates a\r\nfeeling of dismay and often of disgust instead of love and reverence;\r\nand the very name of a saint savours in Irish Protestant ears of\r\nidolatry, although Irish Protestants on every Sunday profess to\r\nbelieve in a communion of such. These are the feelings rather than\r\nthe opinions of the most Protestant of Irish Protestants, and it\r\nis intelligible that they should have been produced by the close\r\nvicinity of Roman Catholic worship in the minds of men who are\r\nenergetic and excitable, but not always discreet or argumentative.\r\n\r\nOne of such was Mr. Townsend, and few men carried their Protestant\r\nfervour further than he did. A cross was to him what a red cloth is\r\nsupposed to be to a bull; and so averse was he to the intercession\r\nof saints, that he always regarded as a wolf in sheep\'s clothing a\r\ncertain English clergyman who had written to him a letter dated from\r\nthe feast of St. Michael and All Angels. On this account Herbert\r\nFitzgerald took upon himself to say that he regarded him as a bad\r\nclergyman: whereas, most of his Protestant neighbours looked upon\r\nthis enthusiasm as his chief excellence.\r\n\r\nAnd this admiration for him induced his friends to overlook what they\r\nmust have acknowledged to be defects in his character. Though he\r\nhad a good living--at least, what the laity in speaking of clerical\r\nincomes is generally inclined to call a good living, we will say\r\namounting in value to four hundred pounds a year--he was always in\r\ndebt. This was the more inexcusable as he had no children, and had\r\nsome small private means.\r\n\r\nAnd nobody knew why he was in debt--in which word nobody he himself\r\nmust certainly be included. He had no personal expenses of his own;\r\nhis wife, though she was a very queer woman, as Lady Clara had said,\r\ncould hardly be called an extravagant woman; there was nothing large\r\nor splendid about the way of living at the glebe; anybody who came\r\nthere, both he and she were willing to feed as long as they chose\r\nto stay, and a good many in this way they did feed; but they never\r\ninvited guests; and as for giving regular fixed dinner-parties, as\r\nparish rectors do in England, no such idea ever crossed the brain of\r\neither Mr. or Mrs. Townsend.\r\n\r\nThat they were both charitable all the world admitted; and their\r\nadmirers professed that hence arose all their difficulties. But their\r\ncharities were of a most indiscreet kind. Money they rarely had to\r\ngive, and therefore they would give promises to pay. While their\r\ncredit with the butcher and baker was good they would give meat and\r\nbread; and both these functionaries had by this time learned that,\r\nthough Mr. Townsend might not be able to pay such bills himself, his\r\nfriends would do so, sooner or later, if duly pressed. And therefore\r\nthe larder at Drumbarrow Glebe--that was the name of the parish--was\r\nnever long empty, and then again it was never long full.\r\n\r\nBut neither Mr. nor Mrs. Townsend were content to bestow their\r\ncharities without some other object than that of relieving material\r\nwants by their alms. Many infidels, Mr. Townsend argued, had been\r\nmade believers by the miracle of the loaves and fishes; and therefore\r\nit was permissible for him to make use of the same means for drawing\r\nover proselytes to the true church. If he could find hungry Papists\r\nand convert them into well-fed Protestants by one and the same\r\nprocess, he must be doing a double good, he argued;--could by no\r\npossibility be doing an evil.\r\n\r\nSuch being the character of Mr. Townsend, it will not be thought\r\nsurprising that he should have his warm admirers and his hot\r\ndetractors. And they who were inclined to be among the latter were\r\nnot slow to add up certain little disagreeable eccentricities among\r\nthe list of his faults,--as young Fitzgerald had done in the matter\r\nof the dirty surplices.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend\'s most uncompromising foe for many years had been the\r\nRev. Bernard M\'Carthy, the parish priest for the same parish of\r\nDrumbarrow. Father Bernard, as he was called by his own flock, or\r\nFather Barney, as the Protestants in derision were delighted to name\r\nhim, was much more a man of the world than his Protestant colleague.\r\nHe did not do half so many absurd things as did Mr. Townsend, and\r\nprofessed to laugh at what he called the Protestant madness of the\r\nrector. But he also had been an eager, I may also say, a malicious\r\nantagonist. What he called the "souping" system of the Protestant\r\nclergyman stank in his nostrils--that system by which, as he stated,\r\nthe most ignorant of men were to be induced to leave their faith by\r\nthe hope of soup, or other food. He was as firmly convinced of the\r\ninward, heart-destroying iniquity of the parson as the parson was of\r\nthat of the priest. And so these two men had learned to hate each\r\nother. And yet neither of them were bad men.\r\n\r\nI do not wish it to be understood that this sort of feeling always\r\nprevailed in Irish parishes between the priest and the parson even\r\nbefore the days of the famine. I myself have met a priest at a\r\nparson\'s table, and have known more than one parish in which the\r\nProtestant and Roman Catholic clergymen lived together on amicable\r\nterms. But such a feeling as that above represented was common,\r\nand was by no means held as proof that the parties themselves\r\nwere quarrelsome or malicious. It was a part of their religious\r\nconvictions, and who dares to interfere with the religious\r\nconvictions of a clergyman?\r\n\r\nOn the day but one after that on which the Castle Richmond ladies\r\nhad been thrown from their car on the frosty road, Mr. Townsend and\r\nFather Bernard were brought together in an amicable way, or in a way\r\nthat was intended to be amicable, for the first time in their lives.\r\nThe relief committee for the district in which they both lived was\r\none and the same, and it was of course well that both should act on\r\nit. When the matter was first arranged, Father Bernard took the bull\r\nby the horns and went there; but Mr. Townsend, hearing this, did not\r\ndo so. But now that it had become evident that much work, and for a\r\nlong time, would have to be performed at these committees, it was\r\nclear that Mr. Townsend, as a Protestant clergyman, could not remain\r\naway without neglecting his duty. And so, after many mental struggles\r\nand questions of conscience, the parson agreed to meet the priest.\r\n\r\nThe point had been very deeply discussed between the rector and his\r\nwife. She had given it as her opinion that priest M\'Carthy was pitch,\r\npitch itself in its blackest turpitude, and as such could not be\r\ntouched without defilement. Had not all the Protestant clergymen\r\nof Ireland in a body, or, at any rate, all those who were worth\r\nanything, who could with truth be called Protestant clergymen, had\r\nthey not all refused to enter the doors of the National schools\r\nbecause they could not do so without sharing their ministration\r\nthere with papist priests; with priests of the altar of Baal, as Mrs.\r\nTownsend called them? And should they now yield, when, after all, the\r\nassistance needed was only for the body--not for the soul?\r\n\r\nIt may be seen from this that the lady\'s mind was not in its nature\r\nlogical; but the extreme absurdity of her arguments, though they did\r\nnot ultimately have the desired effect, by no means came home to\r\nthe understanding of her husband. He thought that there was a great\r\ndeal in what she said, and almost felt that he was yielding to\r\ninstigations from the evil one; but public opinion was too strong for\r\nhim; public opinion and the innate kindness of his own heart. He felt\r\nthat at this very moment he ought to labour specially for the bodies\r\nof these poor people, as at other times he would labour specially for\r\ntheir souls; and so he yielded.\r\n\r\n"Well," said his wife to him as he got off his car at his own door\r\nafter the meeting, "what have you done?" One might have imagined from\r\nher tone of voice and her manner that she expected, or at least hoped\r\nto hear that the priest had been absolutely exterminated and made\r\naway with in the good fight.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend made no immediate answer, but proceeded to divest\r\nhimself of his rusty outside coat, and to rub up his stiff, grizzled,\r\nbristly, uncombed hair with both his hands, as was his wont when he\r\nwas not quite satisfied with the state of things.\r\n\r\n"I suppose he was there?" said Mrs. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, he was there. He is never away, I take it, when there\r\nis any talking to be done." Now Mr. Townsend dearly loved to hear\r\nhimself talk, but no man was louder against the sins of other\r\norators. And then he began to ask how many minutes it wanted to\r\ndinner-time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Townsend knew his ways. She would not have a ghost of a chance\r\nof getting from him a true and substantial account of what had really\r\npassed if she persevered in direct questions to the effect. So\r\nshe pretended to drop the matter, and went and fetched her lord\'s\r\nslippers, the putting on of which constituted his evening toilet; and\r\nthen, after some little hurrying inquiry in the kitchen, promised him\r\nhis dinner in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n"Was Herbert Fitzgerald there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; he is always there. He\'s a nice young fellow; a very fine\r\nyoung fellow; but--"\r\n\r\n"But what?"\r\n\r\n"He thinks he understands the Irish Roman Catholics, but he\r\nunderstands them no more than--than--than this slipper," he said,\r\nhaving in vain cudgelled his brain for a better comparison.\r\n\r\n"You know what Aunt Letty says about him. She doubts he isn\'t quite\r\nright, you know."\r\n\r\nMrs. Townsend by this did not mean to insinuate that Herbert was at\r\nall afflicted in that way which we attempt to designate, when we\r\nsay that one of our friends is not all right, and at the same time\r\ntouch our heads with our forefinger. She had intended to convey an\r\nimpression that the young man\'s religious ideas were not exactly of\r\nthat stanch, true-blue description which she admired.\r\n\r\n"Well, he has just come from Oxford, you know," said Mr. Townsend:\r\n"and at the present moment Oxford is the most dangerous place to\r\nwhich a young man can be sent."\r\n\r\n"And Sir Thomas would send him there, though I remember telling his\r\naunt over and over again how it would be." And Mrs. Townsend as she\r\nspoke, shook her head sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to say, you know, that he\'s absolutely bitten."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know--I understand. When they come to crosses and\r\ncandlesticks, the next step to the glory of Mary is a very easy one.\r\nI would sooner send a young man to Rome than to Oxford. At the one he\r\nmight be shocked and disgusted; but at the other he is cajoled, and\r\ncheated, and ruined." And then Mrs. Townsend threw herself back in\r\nher chair, and threw her eyes up towards the ceiling.\r\n\r\nBut there was no hypocrisy or pretence in this expression of her\r\nfeelings. She did in her heart of hearts believe that there was some\r\ncollege or club of papists at Oxford, emissaries of the Pope or of\r\nthe Jesuits. In her moments of sterner thought the latter were the\r\nenemies she most feared; whereas, when she was simply pervaded by\r\nher usual chronic hatred of the Irish Roman Catholic hierarchy, she\r\nwas wont to inveigh most against the Pope. And this college, she\r\nmaintained, was fearfully successful in drawing away the souls of\r\nyoung English students. Indeed, at Oxford a man had no chance against\r\nthe devil. Things were better at Cambridge; though even there there\r\nwas great danger. Look at A---- and Z----; and she would name two\r\nperverts to the Church of Rome, of whom she had learned that they\r\nwere Cambridge men. But, thank God, Trinity College still stood firm.\r\nHer idea was, that if there were left any real Protestant truth in\r\nthe Church of England, that Church should look to feed her lambs\r\nby the hands of shepherds chosen from that seminary, and from that\r\nseminary only.\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t dinner nearly ready?" said Mr. Townsend, whose ideas were\r\nnot so exclusively Protestant as were those of his wife. "I haven\'t\r\nhad a morsel since breakfast." And then his wife, who was peculiarly\r\nanxious to keep him in a good humour that all might come out about\r\nFather Barney, made another little visit to the kitchen.\r\n\r\nAt last the dinner was served. The weather was very cold, and the\r\nrector and his wife considered it more cosy to use only the parlour,\r\nand not to migrate into the cold air of a second room. Indeed, during\r\nthe winter months the drawing-room of Drumbarrow Glebe was only used\r\nfor visitors, and for visitors who were not intimate enough in the\r\nhouse to be placed upon the worn chairs and threadbare carpet of the\r\ndining-parlour. And very cold was that drawing-room found to be by\r\neach visitor.\r\n\r\nBut the parlour was warm enough; warm and cosy, though perhaps at\r\ntimes a little close; and of evenings there would pervade it a smell\r\nof whisky punch, not altogether acceptable to unaccustomed nostrils.\r\nNot that the rector of Drumbarrow was by any means an intemperate\r\nman. His single tumbler of whisky toddy, repeated only on Sundays\r\nand some other rare occasions, would by no means equal, in point of\r\ndrinking, the ordinary port of an ordinary English clergyman. But\r\nwhisky punch does leave behind a savour of its intrinsic virtues,\r\ndelightful no doubt to those who have imbibed its grosser elements,\r\nbut not equally acceptable to others who may have been less\r\nfortunate.\r\n\r\nDuring dinner there was no conversation about Herbert Fitzgerald,\r\nor the committee, or Father Barney. The old gardener, who waited at\r\ntable with all his garden clothes on him, and whom the neighbours,\r\nwith respectful deference, called Mr. Townsend\'s butler, was a Roman\r\nCatholic; as, indeed, were all the servants at the glebe, and as are,\r\nnecessarily, all the native servants in that part of the country. And\r\nthough Mr. and Mrs. Townsend put great trust in their servant Jerry\r\nas to the ordinary duties of gardening, driving, and butlering,\r\nthey would not knowingly trust him with a word of their habitual\r\nconversation about the things around them. Their idea was, that every\r\nword so heard was carried to the priest, and that the priest kept a\r\nbook in which every word so uttered was written down. If this were so\r\nthrough the parish, the priest must in truth have had something to\r\ndo, both for himself and his private secretary; for, in spite of all\r\nprecautions that were taken, Jerry and Jerry\'s brethren no doubt did\r\nhear much of what was said. The repetitions to the priest, however, I\r\nmust take leave to doubt.\r\n\r\nBut after dinner, when the hot water and whisky were on the table,\r\nwhen the two old arm-chairs were drawn cozily up on the rug, each\r\nwith an old footstool before it; when the faithful wife had mixed\r\nthat glass of punch--or jug rather, for, after the old fashion, it\r\nwas brewed in such a receptacle; and when, to inspire increased\r\nconfidence, she had put into it a small extra modicum of the eloquent\r\nspirit, then the mouth of the rector was opened, and Mrs. Townsend\r\nwas made happy.\r\n\r\n"And so Father Barney and I have met at last," said he, rather\r\ncheerily, as the hot fumes of the toddy regaled his nostrils.\r\n\r\n"And how did he behave now?"\r\n\r\n"Well, he was decent enough--that is, as far as absolute behaviour\r\nwent. You can\'t have a silk purse from off a sow\'s ear, you know."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; and goodness knows there\'s plenty of the sow\'s ear about\r\nhim. But now, \xc6neas, dear, do tell me how it all was, just from the\r\nbeginning."\r\n\r\n"He was there before me," said the husband.\r\n\r\n"Catch a weasel asleep!" said the wife.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t catch him asleep at any rate," continued he. "He was there\r\nbefore me; but when I went into the little room where they hold the\r\nmeeting--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s at Berryhill, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, at the Widow Casey\'s. To see that woman bowing and scraping\r\nand curtsying to Father Barney, and she his own mother\'s brother\'s\r\ndaughter, was the best thing in the world."\r\n\r\n"That was just to do him honour before the quality, you know."\r\n\r\n"Exactly. When I went in, there was nobody there but his reverence\r\nand Master Herbert."\r\n\r\n"As thick as possible, I suppose. Dear, dear; isn\'t it dreadful!--Did\r\nI put sugar enough in it, \xc6neas?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know; perhaps you may give me another small lump. At\r\nany rate, you didn\'t forget the whisky."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it isn\'t a taste too strong--and after such work as you\'ve\r\nhad to-day.--And so young Fitzgerald and Father Barney--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there they were with their heads together. It was something\r\nabout a mill they were saying."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s perfectly dreadful!"\r\n\r\n"But Herbert stopped, and introduced me at once to Father Barney."\r\n\r\n"What! a regular introduction? I like that, indeed."\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t do it altogether badly. He said something about being glad\r\nto see two gentlemen together--"\r\n\r\n"A gentleman, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"--who were both so anxious to do the best they could in the parish,\r\nand whose influence was so great--or something to that effect. And\r\nthen we shook hands."\r\n\r\n"You did shake hands?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; if I went there at all, it was necessary that I should do\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"I am very glad it was not me, that\'s all. I don\'t think I could\r\nshake hands with Father Barney."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no knowing what you can do, my dear, till you try."\r\n\r\n"H--m," said Mrs. Townsend, meaning to signify thereby that she was\r\nstill strong in the strength of her own impossibilities.\r\n\r\n"And then there was a little general conversation about the potato,\r\nfor no one came in for a quarter of an hour or so. The priest said\r\nthat they were as badly off in Limerick and Clare as we are here.\r\nNow, I don\'t believe that; and when I asked him how he knew, he\r\nquoted the \'Freeman.\'"\r\n\r\n"The \'Freeman,\' indeed! Just like him. I wonder it wasn\'t the\r\n\'Nation.\'" In Mrs. Townsend\'s estimation, the parish priest was much\r\nto blame because he did not draw his public information from some\r\nnewspaper specially addicted to the support of the Protestant cause.\r\n\r\n"And then Somers came in, and he took the chair. I was very much\r\nafraid at one time that Father Barney was going to seat himself\r\nthere."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t possibly have stood that?"\r\n\r\n"I had made up my mind what to do. I should have walked about the\r\nroom, and looked on the whole affair as altogether irregular,--as\r\nthough there was no chairman. But Somers was of course the proper\r\nman."\r\n\r\n"And who else came?"\r\n\r\n"There was O\'Leary, from Boherbue."\r\n\r\n"He was another Papist?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; there was a majority of them. There was Greilly, the man\r\nwho has got that large take of land over beyond Banteer; and then\r\nFather Barney\'s coadjutor came in."\r\n\r\n"What! that wretched-looking man from Gortnaclough?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he\'s the curate of the parish, you know."\r\n\r\n"And did you shake hands with him too?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I did; and you never saw a fellow look so ashamed of himself\r\nin your life."\r\n\r\n"Well, there isn\'t much shame about them generally."\r\n\r\n"And there wasn\'t much about him by-and-by. You never heard a man\r\ntalk such trash in your life, till Somers put him down."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he was put down? I\'m glad of that."\r\n\r\n"And to do Father Barney justice, he did tell him to hold his tongue.\r\nThe fool began to make a regular set speech."\r\n\r\n"Father Barney, I suppose, didn\'t choose that anybody should do that\r\nbut himself."\r\n\r\n"He did enough for the two, certainly. I never heard a man so fond of\r\nhis own voice. What he wants is to rule it all just his own way."\r\n\r\n"Of course he does; and that\'s just what you won\'t let him do. What\r\nother reason can there be for your going there?"\r\n\r\nAnd so the matter was discussed. What absolute steps were taken\r\nby the committee; how they agreed to buy so much meal of such a\r\nmerchant, at such a price, and with such funds; how it was to be\r\nresold, and never given away on any pretext; how Mr. Somers had\r\nexplained that giving away their means was killing the goose that\r\nlaid the golden eggs, when the young priest, in an attitude for\r\noratory, declared that the poor had no money with which to make the\r\npurchase; and how in a few weeks\' time they would be able to grind\r\ntheir own flour at Herbert Fitzgerald\'s mill;--all this was also\r\ntold. But the telling did not give so much gratification to Mrs.\r\nTownsend as the sly hits against the two priests.\r\n\r\nAnd then, while they were still in the middle of all this; when the\r\npunch-jug had given way to the teapot, and the rector was beginning\r\nto bethink himself that a nap in his arm-chair would be very\r\nrefreshing, Jerry came into the room to announce that Richard had\r\ncome over from Castle Richmond with a note for "his riverence." And\r\nso Richard was shown in.\r\n\r\nNow Richard might very well have sent in his note by Jerry, which\r\nafter all contained only some information with reference to a list\r\nof old women which Herbert Fitzgerald had promised to send over to\r\nthe glebe. But Richard knew that the minister would wish to chat\r\nwith him, and Richard himself had no indisposition for a little\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n"I hope yer riverences is quite well then," said Richard, as he\r\ntendered his note, making a double bow, so as to include them both.\r\n\r\n"Pretty well, thank you," said Mrs. Townsend. "And how\'s all the\r\nfamily?"\r\n\r\n"Well, then, they\'re all rightly, considhering. The Masther\'s no just\r\nwhat he war, you know, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not--I\'m afraid not," said the rector. "You\'ll not take a\r\nglass of spirits, Richard?"\r\n\r\n"Yer riverence knows I never does that," said Richard, with somewhat\r\nof a conscious look of high morality, for he was a rigid teetotaller.\r\n\r\n"And do you mean to say that you stick to that always?" said Mrs.\r\nTownsend, who firmly believed that no good could come out of\r\nNazareth, and that even abstinence from whisky must be bad if\r\naccompanied by anything in the shape of a Roman Catholic ceremony.\r\n\r\n"I do mean to say, ma\'am, that I never touched a dhrop of anything\r\nsthronger than wather, barring tay, since the time I got the pledge\r\nfrom the blessed apostle." And Richard boldly crossed himself in the\r\npresence of them both. They knew well whom he meant by the blessed\r\napostle: it was Father Mathew.\r\n\r\n"Temperance is a very good thing, however we may come by it," said\r\nMr. Townsend, who meant to imply by this that Richard\'s temperance\r\nhad been come by in the worst way possible.\r\n\r\n"That\'s thrue for you, sir," said Richard; "but I never knew any\r\npledge kept, only the blessed apostle\'s." By which he meant to imply\r\nthat no sanctity inherent in Mr. Townsend\'s sacerdotal proceedings\r\ncould be of any such efficacy.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Townsend read the note. "Ah, yes," said he; "tell Mr.\r\nHerbert that I\'m very much obliged to him. There will be no other\r\nanswer necessary."\r\n\r\n"Very well, yer riverence, I\'ll be sure to give Mr. Herbert the\r\nmessage." And Richard made a sign as though he were going.\r\n\r\n"But tell me, Richard," said Mrs. Townsend, "is Sir Thomas any\r\nbetter? for we have been really very uneasy about him."\r\n\r\n"Indeed and he is, ma\'am; a dail betther this morning, the Lord be\r\npraised."\r\n\r\n"It was a kind of a fit, wasn\'t it, Richard?" asked the parson.\r\n\r\n"A sort of a fit of illness of some kind, I\'m thinking," said\r\nRichard, who had no mind to speak of his family\'s secrets out of\r\ndoors. Whatever he might be called upon to tell the priest, at any\r\nrate he was not called on to tell anything to the parson.\r\n\r\n"But it was very sudden this time, wasn\'t it, Richard?" asked the\r\nlady; "immediately after that strange man was shown into his\r\nroom--eh?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure, ma\'am, I can\'t say; but I don\'t think he was a ha\'porth\r\nworse than ordinar, till after the gentleman went away. I did hear\r\nthat he did his business with the gentleman, just as usual like."\r\n\r\n"And then he fell into a fit, didn\'t he, Richard?"\r\n\r\n"Not that I heard of, ma\'am. He did a dail of talking about some law\r\nbusiness, I did hear our Mrs. Jones say; and then afther he warn\'t\r\njust the betther of it."\r\n\r\n"Was that all?"\r\n\r\n"And I don\'t think he\'s none the worse for it neither, ma\'am; for the\r\nmasther do seem to have more life in him this day than I\'se seen this\r\nmany a month. Why, he\'s been out and about with her ladyship in the\r\npony-carriage all the morning."\r\n\r\n"Has he now? Well, I\'m delighted to hear that. It is some trouble\r\nabout the English estates, I believe, that vexes him?"\r\n\r\n"Faix, then, ma\'am, I don\'t just know what it is that ails him,\r\nunless it be just that he has too much money for to know what to do\r\nwid it. That\'d be the sore vexation to me, I know."\r\n\r\n"Well; ah, yes; I suppose I shall see Mrs. Jones to-morrow, or at\r\nlatest the day after," said Mrs. Townsend, resolving to pique the man\r\nby making him understand that she could easily learn all that she\r\nwished to learn from the woman: "a great comfort Mrs. Jones must be\r\nto her ladyship."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, ma\'am; \'deed an\' she is," said Richard; "\'specially in the\r\nmatter of puddins and pies, and such like."\r\n\r\nHe was not going to admit Mrs. Jones\'s superiority, seeing that he\r\nhad lived in the family long before his present mistress\'s marriage.\r\n\r\n"And in a great many other things too, Richard. She\'s quite a\r\nconfidential servant. That\'s because she\'s a Protestant, you know."\r\n\r\nNow of all men, women, and creatures living, Richard the coachman of\r\nCastle Richmond was the most good tempered. No amount of anger or\r\nscolding, no professional misfortune--such as the falling down of\r\nhis horse upon the ice, no hardship--such as three hours\' perpetual\r\nrain when he was upon the box--would make him cross. To him it was a\r\nmatter of perfect indifference if he were sent off with his car just\r\nbefore breakfast, or called away to some stable work as the dinner\r\nwas about to smoke in the servants\' hall. He was a great eater, but\r\nwhat he didn\'t eat one day he could eat the next. Such things never\r\nruffled him, nor was he ever known to say that such a job wasn\'t his\r\nwork. He was always willing to nurse a baby, or dig potatoes, or cook\r\na dinner, to the best of his ability, when asked to do so; but he\r\ncould not endure to be made less of than a Protestant; and of all\r\nProtestants he could not endure to be made less of than Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n"\'Cause she\'s a Protestant, is it, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, Richard; you can\'t but see that Protestants are more\r\ntrusted, more respected, more thought about than Romanists, can you?"\r\n\r\n"\'Deed then I don\'t know, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"But look at Mrs. Jones."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I looks at her often enough; and she\'s well enough too for a\r\nwoman. But we all know her weakness."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that, Richard?" asked Mrs. Townsend, with some interest\r\nexpressed in her tone; for she was not above listening to a little\r\nscandal, even about the servants of her great neighbours.\r\n\r\n"Why, she do often talk about things she don\'t understand. But she\'s\r\na great hand at puddins and pies, and that\'s what one mostly looks\r\nfor in a woman."\r\n\r\nThis was enough for Mrs. Townsend for the present, and so Richard was\r\nallowed to take his departure, in full self-confidence that he had\r\nbeen one too many for the parson\'s wife.\r\n\r\n"Jerry," said Richard, as they walked out into the yard together\r\nto get the Castle Richmond pony, "does they often thry to make a\r\nProthestant of you now?"\r\n\r\n"Prothestants be d----," said Jerry, who by no means shared in\r\nRichard\'s good gifts as to temper.\r\n\r\n"Well, I wouldn\'t say that; at laist, not of all of \'em."\r\n\r\n"The likes of them\'s used to it," said Jerry.\r\n\r\nAnd then Richard, not waiting to do further battle on behalf of his\r\nProtestant friends, trotted out of the yard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSECOND LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day after Clara\'s departure, Herbert did, as a matter of\r\ncourse, make his promised visit at Desmond Court. It was on that day\r\nthat Sir Thomas had been driving about in the pony-carriage with Lady\r\nFitzgerald, as Richard had reported. Herbert had been with his father\r\nin the morning, and then having seen him and his mother well packed\r\nup in their shawls and cloaks, had mounted his horse and ridden off.\r\n\r\n"I may be kept some time," said he, "as I have promised to go on to\r\nClady, and see after that soup kitchen."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder if Herbert became attached to Clara Desmond,"\r\nsaid the mother to Sir Thomas, soon after they had begun their\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" said the baronet; and his tone was certainly not\r\nexactly that of approbation.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; I certainly do think it probable. I am sure he admires\r\nher, and I think it very likely to come to more. Would there be any\r\nobjection?"\r\n\r\n"They are both very young," said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"But in Herbert\'s position will not a young marriage be the best\r\nthing for him?"\r\n\r\n"And she has no fortune; not a shilling. If he does marry young,\r\nquite young you know, it might be prudent that his wife should have\r\nsomething of her own."\r\n\r\n"They\'d live here," said Lady Fitzgerald, who knew that of all men\r\nher husband was usually most free from mercenary feelings and an\r\nover-anxiety as to increased wealth, either for himself or for his\r\nchildren; "and I think it would be such a comfort to you. Herbert,\r\nyou see, is so fond of county business, and so little anxious for\r\nwhat young men generally consider pleasure."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more said about it at that moment; for the question\r\nin some measure touched upon money matters and considerations as to\r\nproperty, from all of which Lady Fitzgerald at present wished to keep\r\nher husband\'s mind free. But towards the end of the drive he himself\r\nagain referred to it.\r\n\r\n"She is a nice girl, isn\'t she?"\r\n\r\n"Very nice, I think; as far as I\'ve seen her."\r\n\r\n"She is pretty, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Very pretty; more than pretty; much more. She will be beautiful."\r\n\r\n"But she is such a mere child. You do not think that anything will\r\ncome of it immediately;--not quite immediately?"\r\n\r\n"Oh no; certainly not quite immediately. I think Herbert is not\r\ncalculated to be very sudden in any such feelings, or in the\r\nexpression of them: but I do think such an event very probable before\r\nthe winter is over."\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Herbert spent the whole day over at Desmond Court,\r\nor at Clady. He found the countess delighted to see him, and both she\r\nand Lady Clara went on with him to Clady. It was past five and quite\r\ndark before he reached Castle Richmond, so that he barely got home in\r\ntime to dress for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-party that evening was more pleasant than usual. Sir\r\nThomas not only dined with them, but came into the drawing-room after\r\ndinner, and to a certain extent joined in their conversation. Lady\r\nFitzgerald could see that this was done by a great effort; but it\r\nwas not remarked by Aunt Letty and the others, who were delighted to\r\nhave him with them, and to see him once more interested about their\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nAnd now the building of the mill had been settled, and the final\r\norders were to be given by Herbert at the spot on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"We can go with you to Berryhill, I suppose, can\'t we?" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"I shall be in a great hurry," said Herbert, who clearly did not wish\r\nto be encumbered by his sisters on this special expedition.\r\n\r\n"And why are you to be in such a hurry to-morrow?" asked Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall be hurried; I have promised to go to Clady again, and\r\nI must be back here early, and must get another horse."\r\n\r\n"Why, Herbert, you are becoming a Hercules of energy," said his\r\nfather, smiling: "you will have enough to do if you look to all the\r\nsoup kitchens on the Desmond property as well as our own."\r\n\r\n"I made a sort of promise about this particular affair at Clady, and\r\nI must carry it out," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"And you\'ll pay your devoirs to the fair Lady Clara on your way home\r\nof course," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"More than probable," he replied.\r\n\r\n"And stay so late again that you\'ll hardly be here in time for\r\ndinner," continued Mary: to which little sally her brother vouchsafed\r\nno answer.\r\n\r\nBut Emmeline said nothing. Lady Clara was specially her friend, and\r\nshe was too anxious to secure such a sister-in-law to make any joke\r\nupon such a subject.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion nothing more was said about it; but Sir Thomas hoped\r\nwithin his heart that his wife was right in prophesying that his son\r\nwould do nothing sudden in this matter.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning young Fitzgerald gave the necessary orders\r\nat Berryhill very quickly, and then coming back remounted another\r\nhorse without going into the house. Then he trotted off to Clady,\r\npassing the gate of Desmond Court without calling; did what he had\r\npromised to do at Clady, or rather that which he had made to stand as\r\nan excuse for again visiting that part of the world so quickly; and\r\nafter that, with a conscience let us hope quite clear, rode up the\r\navenue at Desmond Court. It was still early in the day when he got\r\nthere, probably not much after two o\'clock; and yet Mary had been\r\nquite correct in foretelling that he would only be home just in time\r\nfor dinner.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, he had not seen Lady Desmond. Why or how it had\r\noccurred that she had been absent from the drawing-room the whole of\r\nthe two hours which he had passed in the house, it may be unnecessary\r\nto explain. Such, however, had been the fact. The first five minutes\r\nhad been passed in inquiries after the bruise, and, it must be owned,\r\nin a surgical inspection of the still discoloured arm. "It must be\r\nvery painful," he had said, looking into her face, as though by\r\ndoing so he could swear that he would so willingly bear all the pain\r\nhimself, if it were only possible to make such an exchange.\r\n\r\n"Not very," she had answered, smiling. "It is only a little stiff. I\r\ncan\'t quite move it easily."\r\n\r\nAnd then she lifted it up, and afterwards dropped it with a little\r\nlook of pain that ran through his heart.\r\n\r\nThe next five minutes were taken up in discussing the case of the\r\nrecusant boiler, and then Clara discovered that she had better go and\r\nfetch her mother. But against the immediate taking of this step he\r\nhad alleged some valid reason, and so they had gone on, till the dark\r\nnight admonished him that he could do no more than save the dinner\r\nhour at Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe room was nearly dark when he left her, and she got up and stood\r\nat the front window, so that, unseen, she might see his figure as he\r\nrode off from the house. He mounted his horse within the quadrangle,\r\nand coming out at the great old-fashioned ugly portal, galloped off\r\nacross the green park with a loose rein and a happy heart. What is it\r\nthe song says?\r\n\r\n\r\n   "Oh, ladies, beware of a gay young knight\r\n    Who loves and who rides away."\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was at Clara\'s heart, as she stood there at the window, some\r\nfeeling of the expediency of being beware, some shadow of doubt as\r\nto the wisdom of what she had done. He rode away gaily, with a happy\r\nspirit, for he had won that on the winning of which he had been\r\nintent. No necessity for caution presented itself to him. He had seen\r\nand loved; had then asked, and had not asked in vain.\r\n\r\nShe stood gazing after him, as long as her straining eye could catch\r\nany outline of his figure as it disappeared through the gloom of the\r\nevening. As long as she could see him, or even fancy that she still\r\nsaw him, she thought only of his excellence; of his high character,\r\nhis kind heart, his talents--which in her estimation were ranked\r\nperhaps above their real value--his tastes, which coincided so well\r\nwith her own, his quiet yet manly bearing, his useful pursuits, his\r\ngait, appearance, and demeanour. All these were of a nature to win\r\nthe heart of such a girl as Clara Desmond; and then, probably, in\r\nsome indistinct way, she remembered the broad acres to which he was\r\nthe heir, and comforted herself by reflecting that this at least was\r\na match which none would think disgraceful for a daughter even of an\r\nEarl of Desmond.\r\n\r\nBut sadder thoughts did come when that figure had wholly disappeared.\r\nHer eye, looking out into the darkness, could not but see another\r\nfigure on which it had often in past times delighted almost\r\nunconsciously to dwell. There, walking on that very road, another\r\nlover, another Fitzgerald, had sworn that he loved her; and had truly\r\nsworn so, as she well knew. She had never doubted his truth to her,\r\nand did not doubt it now;--and yet she had given herself away to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAnd in many things he too, that other lover, had been noble and\r\ngracious, and fit for a woman to love. In person he exceeded all\r\nthat she had ever seen or dreamed of; and why should we think that\r\npersonal excellence is to count for nothing in female judgment, when\r\nin that of men it ranks so immeasurably above all other excellences?\r\nHis bearing, too, was chivalrous and bold, his language full of\r\npoetry, and his manner of loving eager, impetuous, and of a kin to\r\nworship. Then, too, he was now in misfortune; and when has that\r\nfailed to soften even the softness of a woman\'s heart?\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that she should not make comparisons, comparisons\r\nthat were so distasteful to her; impossible, also, that she should\r\nnot accuse herself of some falseness to that first lover. The time to\r\nus, my friends, seems short enough since she was walking there, and\r\nlistening with childish delight to Owen\'s protestations of love. It\r\nwas but little more than one year since: but to her those months had\r\nbeen very long. And, reader, if thou hast arrived at any period of\r\nlife which enables thee to count thy past years by lustrums; if thou\r\nart at a time of life, past thirty we will say, hast thou not found\r\nthat thy years, which are now short enough, were long in those bygone\r\ndays?\r\n\r\nThose fourteen months were to her the space almost of a second life,\r\nas she now looked back upon them. When those earlier vows were made,\r\nwhat had she cared for prudence, for the world\'s esteem, or an\r\nalliance that might be becoming to her? That Owen Fitzgerald was a\r\ngentleman of high blood and ancient family, so much she had cared to\r\nknow; for the rest, she had only cared to feel this, that her heart\r\nbeat high with pleasure when he was with her.\r\n\r\nDid her heart beat as high now, when his cousin was beside her? No;\r\nshe felt that it did not. And sometimes she felt, or feared to feel,\r\nthat it might beat high again when she should again see the lover\r\nwhom her judgment had rejected.\r\n\r\nHer judgment had rejected him altogether long before an idea had at\r\nall presented itself to her that Herbert Fitzgerald could become her\r\nsuitor. Nor had this been done wholly in obedience to her mother\'s\r\nmandate. She had realized in her own mind the conviction that Owen\r\nFitzgerald was not a man with whom any girl could at present safely\r\nlink her fortune. She knew well that he was idle, dissipated, and\r\nextravagant; and she could not believe that these vices had arisen\r\nonly from his banishment from her, and that they would cease and\r\nvanish whenever that banishment might cease.\r\n\r\nMessages came to her, in underhand ways--ways well understood in\r\nIreland, and not always ignored in England--to the effect that all\r\nhis misdoings arose from his unhappiness; that he drank and gambled\r\nonly because the gates of Desmond Court were no longer open to him.\r\nThere was that in Clara\'s heart which did for a while predispose her\r\nto believe somewhat of this, to hope that it might not be altogether\r\nfalse. Could any girl loving such a man not have had some such hope?\r\nBut then the stories of these revelries became worse and worse,\r\nand it was dinned into her ears that these doings had been running\r\non in all their enormity before that day of his banishment. And\r\nso, silently and sadly, with no outspoken word either to mother or\r\nbrother, she had resolved to give him up.\r\n\r\nThere was no necessity to her for any outspoken word. She had\r\npromised her mother to hold no intercourse with the man; and she\r\nhad kept and would keep her promise. Why say more about it? How she\r\nmight have reconciled her promise to her mother with an enduring\r\nengagement, had Owen Fitzgerald\'s conduct allowed her to regard her\r\nengagement as enduring,--that had been a sore trouble to her while\r\nhope had remained; but now no hope remained, and that trouble was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nAnd then Herbert Fitzgerald had come across her path, and those\r\nsweet, loving, kind Fitzgerald girls, who were always ready to cover\r\nher with such sweet caresses, with whom she had known more of the\r\nhappiness of friendliness than ever she had felt before. They threw\r\nthemselves upon her like sisters, and she had never before enjoyed\r\nsisterly treatment. He had come across her path; and from the first\r\nmoment she had become conscious of his admiration.\r\n\r\nShe knew herself to be penniless, and dreaded that she should be\r\nlooked upon as wishing to catch the rich heir. But every one had\r\nconspired to throw them together. Lady Fitzgerald had welcomed her\r\nlike a mother, with more caressing soft tenderness than her own\r\nmother usually vouchsafed to her; and even Sir Thomas had gone out of\r\nhis usual way to be kind to her.\r\n\r\nThat her mother would approve of such a marriage she could not doubt.\r\nLady Desmond in these latter days had not said much to her about\r\nOwen; but she had said very much of the horrors of poverty. And she\r\nhad been too subtle to praise the virtues of Herbert with open plain\r\nwords; but she had praised the comforts of a handsome income and\r\nwell-established family mansion. Clara at these times had understood\r\nmore than had been intended, and had, therefore, put herself on her\r\nguard against her mother\'s worldly wisdom; but, nevertheless, the\r\ndropping of the water had in some little measure hollowed the stone\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, thinking of these things, she stood at the window for some\r\nhalf-hour after the form of her accepted lover had become invisible\r\nin the gathering gloom of the evening.\r\n\r\nAnd then her mother entered the room, and candles were brought. Lady\r\nDesmond was all smiles and benignity, as she had been for this last\r\nweek past, while Herbert Fitzgerald had been coming and going almost\r\ndaily at Desmond Court. But Clara understood this benignity, and\r\ndisliked it.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, now necessary that everything should be told.\r\nHerbert had declared that he should at once inform his father and\r\nmother, and obtain their permission for his marriage. He spoke of\r\nit as a matter on which there was no occasion for any doubt or\r\nmisgiving. He was an only son, he said, and trusted and loved in\r\neverything. His father never opposed him on any subject whatever; and\r\nwould, he was sure, consent to any match he might propose. "But as\r\nto you," he added, with a lover\'s flattering fervour, "they are all\r\nso fond of you, they all think so much of you, that my only fear is\r\nthat I shall be jealous. They\'ll all make love to you, Aunt Letty\r\nincluded."\r\n\r\nIt was therefore essential that she should at once tell her mother,\r\nand ask her mother\'s leave. She had once before confessed a tale of\r\nlove, and had done so with palpitation of the heart, with trembling\r\nof the limbs, and floods of tears. Then her tale had been received\r\nwith harsh sternness. Now she could tell her story without any\r\ntrembling, with no tears; but it was almost indifferent to her\r\nwhether her mother was harsh or tender.\r\n\r\n"What! has Mr. Fitzgerald gone?" said the countess, on entering the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma; this half-hour," said Clara, not as yet coming away from\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"I did not hear his horse, and imagined he was here still. I hope he\r\nhas not thought me terribly uncivil, but I could not well leave what\r\nI was doing."\r\n\r\nTo this little make-believe speech Clara did not think it necessary\r\nto return any answer. She was thinking how she would begin to say\r\nthat for saying which there was so strong a necessity, and she could\r\nnot take a part in small false badinage on a subject which was so\r\nnear her heart.\r\n\r\n"And what about that stupid mason at Clady?" asked the countess,\r\nstill making believe.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald was there again to-day, mamma; and I think it will be\r\nall right now; but he did not say much about it."\r\n\r\n"Why not? you were all so full of it yesterday."\r\n\r\nClara, who had half turned round towards the light, now again turned\r\nherself towards the window. This task must be done; but the doing of\r\nit was so disagreeable! How was she to tell her mother that she loved\r\nthis man, seeing that so short a time since she had declared that she\r\nloved another?\r\n\r\n"And what was he talking about, love?" said the countess, ever\r\nso graciously. "Or, perhaps, no questioning on the matter can be\r\nallowed. May I ask questions, or may I not? eh, Clara?" and then the\r\nmother, walking up towards the window, put her fair white hands upon\r\nher daughter\'s two shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Of course you may inquire," said Clara.\r\n\r\n"Then I do inquire--immediately. What has this _preux chevalier_ been\r\nsaying to my Clara, that makes her stand thus solemn and silent,\r\ngazing out into the dark night?"\r\n\r\n"Mamma!"\r\n\r\n"Well, love?"\r\n\r\n"Herbert Fitzgerald has--has asked me to be his wife. He has proposed\r\nto me."\r\n\r\nThe mother\'s arm now encircled the daughter lovingly, and the\r\nmother\'s lips were pressed to the daughter\'s forehead. "Herbert\r\nFitzgerald has asked you to be his wife, has he? And what answer has\r\nmy bonny bird deigned to make to so audacious a request?"\r\n\r\nLady Desmond had never before spoken to her daughter in tones so\r\ngracious, in a manner so flattering, so caressing, so affectionate.\r\nBut Clara would not open her heart to her mother\'s tenderness. She\r\ncould not look into her mother\'s face, and welcome her mother\'s\r\nconsent with unutterable joy, as she would have done had that consent\r\nbeen given a year since to a less prudent proposition. That marriage\r\nfor which she was now to ask her mother\'s sanction would of course\r\nbe sanctioned. She had no favour to beg; nothing for which to be\r\ngrateful. With a slight motion, unconsciously, unwillingly, but not\r\nthe less positively, she repulsed her mother\'s caress as she answered\r\nher question.\r\n\r\n"I have accepted him, mamma; that is, of course, if you do not\r\nobject."\r\n\r\n"My own, own child!" said the countess, seizing her daughter in her\r\narms, and pressing her to her bosom. And in truth Clara was, now\r\nprobably for the first time, her own heart\'s daughter. Her son,\r\nthough he was but a poor earl, was Earl of Desmond. He too, though in\r\ntruth but a poor earl, was not absolutely destitute,--would in truth\r\nbe blessed with a fair future. But Lady Clara had hitherto been felt\r\nonly as a weight. She had been born poor as poverty itself, and\r\nhitherto had shown so little disposition to find for herself a remedy\r\nfor this crushing evil! But now--now matters were indeed changed. She\r\nhad obtained for herself the best match in the whole country round,\r\nand, in doing so, had sacrificed her heart\'s young love. Was she not\r\nentitled to all a mother\'s tenderness? Who knew, who could know the\r\nmiseries of poverty so well as the Countess of Desmond? Who then\r\ncould feel so much gratitude to a child for prudently escaping from\r\nthem? Lady Desmond did feel grateful to her daughter.\r\n\r\n"My own, own child; my happy girl," she repeated. "He is a man to\r\nwhom any mother in all the land would be proud to see her daughter\r\nmarried. Never, never did I see a young man so perfectly worthy of a\r\ngirl\'s love. He is so thoroughly well educated, so thoroughly well\r\nconducted, so good-looking, so warm-hearted, so advantageously\r\nsituated in all his circumstances. Of course he will go into\r\nParliament, and then any course is open to him. The property is, I\r\nbelieve, wholly unembarrassed, and there are no younger brothers.\r\nYou may say that the place is his own already, for old Sir Thomas\r\nis almost nobody. I do wish you joy, my own dearest, dearest Clara!"\r\nAfter which burst of maternal eloquence, the countess pressed her\r\nlips to those of her child, and gave her a mother\'s warmest kiss.\r\n\r\nClara was conscious that she was thoroughly dissatisfied with her\r\nmother, but she could not exactly say why it was so. She did return\r\nher mother\'s kiss, but she did it coldly, and with lips that were not\r\neager.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you think that I have done right, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Right, my love! Of course I think that you have done right: only\r\nI give you no credit, dearest; none in the least; for how could you\r\nhelp loving one so lovable in every way as dear Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"Credit! no, there is no credit," she said, not choosing to share her\r\nmother\'s pleasantry.\r\n\r\n"But there is this credit. Had you not been one of the sweetest girls\r\nthat ever was born, he would not have loved you."\r\n\r\n"He has loved me because there was no one else here," said Clara.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! No one else here, indeed! Has he not the power if he\r\npleases to go and choose whomever he will in all London. Had he been\r\nmercenary, and wanted money," said the countess, in a tone which\r\nshowed how thoroughly she despised any such vice, "he might have\r\nhad what he would. But then he could not have had my Clara. But\r\nhe has looked for beauty and manners and high-bred tastes, and an\r\naffectionate heart; and, in my opinion, he could not have been more\r\nsuccessful in his search." After which second burst of eloquence, she\r\nagain kissed her daughter.\r\n\r\n\'Twas thus, at that moment, that she congratulated the wife of the\r\nfuture Sir Herbert Fitzgerald; and then she allowed Clara to go up\r\nto her own room, there to meditate quietly on what she had done, and\r\non that which she was about to do. But late in the evening, Lady\r\nDesmond, whose mind was thoroughly full of the subject, again broke\r\nout into triumph.\r\n\r\n"You must write to Patrick to-morrow, Clara. He must hear the good\r\nnews from no one but yourself."\r\n\r\n"Had we not better wait a little, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Why, my love? You hardly know how anxious your brother is for your\r\nwelfare."\r\n\r\n"I knew it was right to tell you, mamma--"\r\n\r\n"Right to tell me! of course it was. You could not have had the heart\r\nto keep it from me for half a day."\r\n\r\n"But perhaps it may be better not to mention it further till we\r\nknow--"\r\n\r\n"Till we know what?" said the countess with a look of fear about her\r\nbrow.\r\n\r\n"Whether Sir Thomas and Lady Fitzgerald will wish it. If they\r\nobject--"\r\n\r\n"Object! why should they object? how can they object? They are not\r\nmercenary people; and you are an earl\'s daughter. And Herbert is not\r\nlike a girl. The property is his own, entailed on him, and he may do\r\nas he pleases."\r\n\r\n"In such a matter I am sure he would not wish to displease either his\r\nfather or his mother."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, my dear; quite nonsense; you do not at all see the\r\ndifference between a young man and a girl. He has a right to do\r\nexactly as he likes in such a matter. But I am quite sure that they\r\nwill not object. Why should they? How can they?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald says that they will not," Clara admitted, almost\r\ngrudgingly.\r\n\r\n"Of course they will not. I don\'t suppose they could bring themselves\r\nto object to anything he might suggest. I never knew a young man so\r\nhappily situated in this respect. He is quite a free agent. I don\'t\r\nthink they would say much to him if he insisted on marrying the\r\ncook-maid. Indeed, it seems to me that his word is quite paramount at\r\nCastle Richmond."\r\n\r\n"All the same, mamma, I would rather not write to Patrick till\r\nsomething more has been settled."\r\n\r\n"You are wrong there, Clara. If anything disagreeable should happen,\r\nwhich is quite impossible, it would be absolutely necessary that your\r\nbrother should know. Believe me, my love, I only advise you for your\r\nown good."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Fitzgerald will probably be here to-morrow; or if not\r\nto-morrow, next day."\r\n\r\n"I have no doubt he will, love. But why do you call him Mr.\r\nFitzgerald? You were calling him Herbert the other day. Don\'t you\r\nremember how I scolded you? I should not scold you now."\r\n\r\nClara made no answer to this, and then the subject was allowed to\r\nrest for that night. She would call him Herbert, she said to herself;\r\nbut not to her mother. She would keep the use of that name till\r\nshe could talk with Emmeline as a sister. Of all her anticipated\r\npleasures, that of having now a real sister was perhaps the greatest;\r\nor, rather, that of being able to talk about Herbert with one whom\r\nshe could love and treat as a sister. But Herbert himself would exact\r\nthe use of his own Christian name, for the delight of his own ears;\r\nthat was a matter of course; that, doubtless, had been already done.\r\n\r\nAnd then mother and daughter went to bed. The countess, as she did\r\nso, was certainly happy to her heart\'s core. Could it be that she had\r\nsome hope, unrecognized by herself, that Owen Fitzgerald might now\r\nonce more be welcomed at Desmond Court? that something might now be\r\ndone to rescue him from that slough of despond?\r\n\r\nAnd Clara too was happy, though her happiness was mixed. She did love\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald. She was sure of that. She said so to herself over\r\nand over again. Love him! of course she loved him, and would cherish\r\nhim as her lord and husband to the last day of her life, the last\r\ngasp of her breath.\r\n\r\nBut still, as sleep came upon her eyelids, she saw in her memory\r\nthe bright flash of that other lover\'s countenance, when he first\r\nastonished her with the avowal of his love, as he walked beside her\r\nunder the elms, with his horse following at his heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDOUBTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe there is no period of life so happy as that in which a\r\nthriving lover leaves his mistress after his first success. His joy\r\nis more perfect then than at the absolute moment of his own eager\r\nvow, and her half-assenting blushes. Then he is thinking mostly of\r\nher, and is to a certain degree embarrassed by the effort necessary\r\nfor success. But when the promise has once been given to him, and\r\nhe is able to escape into the domain of his own heart, he is as a\r\nconqueror who has mastered half a continent by his own strategy.\r\n\r\nIt never occurs to him, he hardly believes, that his success is no\r\nmore than that which is the ordinary lot of mortal man. He never\r\nreflects that all the old married fogies whom he knows and despises,\r\nhave just as much ground for pride, if such pride were enduring; that\r\nevery fat, silent, dull, somnolent old lady whom he sees and quizzes,\r\nhas at some period been deemed as worthy a prize as his priceless\r\ngalleon; and so deemed by as bold a captor as himself.\r\n\r\nSome one has said that every young mother, when her first child is\r\nborn, regards the babe as the most wonderful production of that\r\ndescription which the world has yet seen. And this too is true. But\r\nI doubt even whether that conviction is so strong as the conviction\r\nof the young successful lover, that he has achieved a triumph which\r\nshould ennoble him down to late generations. As he goes along he has\r\na contempt for other men; for they know nothing of such glory as\r\nhis. As he pores over his "Blackstone," he remembers that he does so,\r\nnot so much that he may acquire law, as that he may acquire Fanny;\r\nand then all other porers over "Blackstone" are low and mean in his\r\nsight--are mercenary in their views and unfortunate in their ideas,\r\nfor they have no Fanny in view.\r\n\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald had this proud feeling strong within his heart\r\nas he galloped away across the greensward, and trotted fast along\r\nthe road, home to Castle Richmond. She was compounded of all\r\nexcellences--so he swore to himself over and over again--and being so\r\ncompounded, she had consented to bestow all these excellences upon\r\nhim. Being herself goddess-like, she had promised to take him as the\r\nobject of her world\'s worship. So he trotted on fast and faster, as\r\nthough conscious of the half-continent which he had won by his skill\r\nand valour.\r\n\r\nShe had told him about his cousin Owen. Indeed, the greater number of\r\nthe soft musical words which she had spoken in that long three hours\'\r\ncolloquy had been spoken on this special point. It had behoved her to\r\ntell him all; and she thought that she had done so. Nay, she had done\r\nso with absolute truth--to the best of her heart\'s power.\r\n\r\n"You were so young then," he had argued; "so very young."\r\n\r\n"Yes, very young. I am not very old now, you know," and she smiled\r\nsweetly on him.\r\n\r\n"No, no; but a year makes so much difference. You were all but a\r\nchild then. You do not love him now, Clara?"\r\n\r\n"No; I do not love him now," she had answered.\r\n\r\nAnd then he exacted a second, a third, a fourth assurance, that she\r\ndid absolutely, actually, and with her whole heart love him, him\r\nHerbert, in lieu of that other him, poor Owen; and with this he,\r\nHerbert, was contented. Content; nay, but proud, elated with triumph,\r\nand conscious of victory. In this spirit he rode home as fast as his\r\nhorse could carry him.\r\n\r\nHe too had to tell his tale to those to whom he owed obedience, and\r\nto beg that they would look upon his intended bride with eyes of\r\nlove and with parental affection. But in this respect he was hardly\r\ntroubled with more doubt than Clara had felt. How could any one\r\nobject to his Clara?\r\n\r\nThere are young men who, from their positions in life, are obliged to\r\nabstain from early marriage, or to look for dowries with their wives.\r\nBut he, luckily, was not fettered in this way. He could marry as he\r\npleased, so long as she whom he might choose brought with her gentle\r\nblood, a good heart, a sweet temper, and such attraction of person\r\nand manners as might make the establishment at Castle Richmond proud\r\nof his young bride. And of whom could that establishment be more\r\nproud than of Lady Clara Desmond? So he rode home without any doubt\r\nto clog his happiness.\r\n\r\nBut he had a source of joy which Clara wanted. She was almost\r\nindifferent to her mother\'s satisfaction; but Herbert looked forward\r\nwith the liveliest, keenest anticipation to his mother\'s gratified\r\ncaresses and unqualified approval--to his father\'s kind smile and\r\nwarm assurance of consent. Clara had made herself known at Castle\r\nRichmond; and he had no doubt but that all this would be added to his\r\ncup of happiness. There was therefore no alloy to debase his virgin\r\ngold as he trotted quickly into the stable-yard.\r\n\r\nBut he resolved that he would say nothing about the matter that\r\nnight. He could not well tell them all in full conclave together.\r\nEarly after breakfast he would go to his father\'s room; and after\r\nthat, he would find his mother. There would then be no doubt that the\r\nnews would duly leak out among his sisters and Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\n"Again only just barely in time, Herbert," said Mary, as they\r\nclustered round the fire before dinner.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t say I ever keep you waiting; and I really think that\'s\r\nsome praise for a man who has got a good many things on his hand."\r\n\r\n"So it is, Herbert," said Emmeline. "But we have done something too.\r\nWe have been over to Berryhill; and the people have already begun\r\nthere: they were at work with their pickaxes among the rocks by the\r\nriver-side."\r\n\r\n"So much the better. Was Mr. Somers there?"\r\n\r\n"We did not see him; but he had been there," said Aunt Letty. "But\r\nMrs. Townsend found us. And who do you think came up to us in the\r\nmost courteous, affable, condescending way?"\r\n\r\n"Who? I don\'t know. Brady, the builder, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed: Brady was not half so civil, for he kept himself to his\r\nown work. It was the Rev. Mr. M\'Carthy, if you please."\r\n\r\n"I only hope you were civil to him," said Herbert, with some slight\r\nsuffusion of colour over his face; for he rather doubted the conduct\r\nof his aunt to the priest, especially as her great Protestant ally,\r\nMrs. Townsend, was of the party.\r\n\r\n"Civil! I don\'t know what you would have, unless you wanted me to\r\nembrace him. He shook hands with us all round. I really thought Mrs.\r\nTownsend would have looked him into the river when he came to her."\r\n\r\n"She always was the quintessence of absurdity and prejudice," said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Herbert!" exclaimed Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\n"Well; and what of \'Oh, Herbert?\' I say she is so. If you and Mary\r\nand Emmeline did not look him into the river when he shook hands with\r\nyou, why should she do so? He is an ordained priest even according to\r\nher own tenets,--only she knows nothing of what her own tenets are."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what they are. They are the substantial, true, and\r\nholy doctrines of the Protestant religion, founded on the gospel.\r\nMrs. Townsend is a thoroughly Protestant woman; one who cannot abide\r\nthe sorceries of popery."\r\n\r\n"Hates them as a mad dog hates water; and with the same amount of\r\njudgment. We none of us wish to be drowned; but nevertheless there\r\nare some good qualities in water."\r\n\r\n"But there are no good qualities in popery," said Aunt Letty, with\r\nher most extreme energy.\r\n\r\n"Are there not?" said Herbert. "I should have thought that belief in\r\nChrist, belief in the Bible, belief in the doctrine of a Saviour\'s\r\natonement, were good qualities. Even the Mahommedan\'s religion has\r\nsome qualities that are good."\r\n\r\n"I would sooner be a Mahommedan than a Papist," said Aunt Letty,\r\nsomewhat thoughtlessly, but very stoutly.\r\n\r\n"You would alter your opinion after the first week in a harem," said\r\nHerbert. And then there was a burst of laughter, in which Aunt Letty\r\nherself joined. "I would sooner go there than go to confession," she\r\nwhispered to Mary, as they all walked off to dinner.\r\n\r\n"And how is the Lady Clara\'s arm?" asked Mary, as soon as they were\r\nagain once more round the fire.\r\n\r\n"The Lady Clara\'s arm is still very blue," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"And I suppose it took you half an hour to weep over it?" continued\r\nhis sister.\r\n\r\n"Exactly, by Shrewsbury clock."\r\n\r\n"And while you were weeping over the arm, what happened to the hand?\r\nShe did not surrender it, did she, in return for so much tenderness\r\non your part?"\r\n\r\nEmmeline thought that Mary was very pertinacious in her badinage, and\r\nwas going to bid her hold her tongue; but she observed that Herbert\r\nblushed, and walked away without further answer. He went to the\r\nfurther end of the long room, and there threw himself on to a sofa.\r\n"Could it be that it was all settled?" thought Emmeline to herself.\r\n\r\nShe followed him to the sofa, and sitting beside him, took hold of\r\nhis arm. "Oh, Herbert! if there is anything to tell, do tell me."\r\n\r\n"Anything to tell!" said he. "What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! you know. I do love her so dearly. I shall never be contented to\r\nlove any one else as your wife--not to love her really, really with\r\nall my heart."\r\n\r\n"What geese you girls are!--you are always thinking of love, and\r\nweddings, and orange-blossoms."\r\n\r\n"It is only for you I think about them," said Emmeline. "I know there\r\nis something to tell. Dear Herbert, do tell me."\r\n\r\n"There is a young bachelor duke coming here to-morrow. He has a\r\nmillion a year, and three counties all his own; he has blue eyes, and\r\nis the handsomest man that ever was seen. Is that news enough?"\r\n\r\n"Very well, Herbert. I would tell you anything."\r\n\r\n"Well; tell me anything."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you this. I know you\'re in love with Clara Desmond, and\r\nI\'m sure she\'s in love with you; and I believe you are both engaged,\r\nand you\'re not nice at all to have a secret from me. I never tease\r\nyou, as Mary does, and it would make me so happy to know it."\r\n\r\nUpon this he put his arm round her waist and whispered one word into\r\nher ear. She gave an exclamation of delight; and as the tears came\r\ninto her eyes congratulated him with a kiss. "Oh dear, oh dear! I am\r\nso happy!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Hush--sh," he whispered. "I knew how it would be if I told you."\r\n\r\n"But they will all know to-morrow, will they not?"\r\n\r\n"Leave that to me. You have coaxed me out of my secret, and you\r\nare bound to keep it." And then he went away well pleased. This\r\ndescription of delight on his sister\'s part was the first instalment\r\nof that joy which he had promised himself from the satisfaction of\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nLady Fitzgerald had watched all that had passed, and had already\r\nlearned her mistake--her mistake in that she had prophesied that no\r\nimmediate proposal was likely to be made by her son. She now knew\r\nwell enough that he had made such a proposal, and that he had been\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nAnd this greatly grieved her. She had felt certain from the few\r\nslight words which Sir Thomas had spoken that there were valid\r\nreasons why her son should not marry a penniless girl. That\r\nconversation, joined to other things, to the man\'s visit, and her\r\nhusband\'s deep dejection, had convinced her that all was not right.\r\nSome misfortune was impending over them, and there had been that in\r\nher own early history which filled her with dismay as she thought of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nShe had ardently desired to caution her son in this respect,--to\r\nguard him, if possible, against future disappointment and future\r\nsorrow. But she could not do so without obtaining in some sort her\r\nhusband\'s assent to her doing so. She resolved that she would talk it\r\nover with Sir Thomas. But the subject was one so full of pain, and he\r\nwas so ill, and therefore she had put it off.\r\n\r\nAnd now she saw that the injury was done. Nevertheless, she said\r\nnothing either to Emmeline or to Herbert. If the injury were done,\r\nwhat good could now result from talking? She doubtless would hear it\r\nall soon enough. So she sat still, watching them.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Sir Thomas did not come out to breakfast.\r\nHerbert went into his room quite early, as was always his custom; and\r\nas he left it for the breakfast-parlour he said, "Father, I should\r\nlike to speak to you just now about something of importance."\r\n\r\n"Something of importance, Herbert; what is it? Anything wrong?" For\r\nSir Thomas was nervous, and easily frightened.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no; nothing is wrong. It is nothing that will annoy you; at\r\nleast I think not. But it will keep till after breakfast. I will come\r\nin again the moment breakfast is over." And so saying he left the\r\nroom with a light step.\r\n\r\nIn the breakfast-parlour it seemed to him as though everybody was\r\nconscious of some important fact. His mother\'s kiss was peculiarly\r\nsolemn and full of solicitude; Aunt Letty smirked as though she was\r\naware of something--something over and above the great Protestant\r\ntenets which usually supported her; and Mary had no joke to fling at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Emmeline," he whispered, "you have told."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," she replied. But what mattered it? Everybody would know\r\nnow in a few minutes. So he ate his breakfast, and then returned to\r\nSir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Father," said he, as soon as he had got into the arm-chair, in which\r\nit was his custom to sit when talking with Sir Thomas, "I hope what\r\nI am going to tell you will give you pleasure. I have proposed to a\r\nyoung lady, and she has--accepted me."\r\n\r\n"You have proposed, and have been accepted!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, father."\r\n\r\n"And the young lady--?"\r\n\r\n"Is Lady Clara Desmond. I hope you will say that you approve of it.\r\nShe has no fortune, as we all know, but that will hardly matter to\r\nme; and I think you will allow that in every other respect she is--"\r\n\r\nPerfect, Herbert would have said, had he dared to express his true\r\nmeaning. But he paused for a moment to look for a less triumphant\r\nword; and then paused again, and left his sentence incomplete, when\r\nhe saw the expression of his father\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father! you do not mean to say that you do not like her?"\r\n\r\nBut it was not dislike that was expressed in his father\'s face, as\r\nHerbert felt the moment after he had spoken. There was pain there,\r\nand solicitude, and disappointment; a look of sorrow at the tidings\r\nthus conveyed to him; but nothing that seemed to betoken dislike of\r\nany person.\r\n\r\n"What is it, sir? Why do you not speak to me? Can it be that you\r\ndisapprove of my marrying?"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas certainly did disapprove of his son\'s marrying, but he\r\nlacked the courage to say so. Much misery that had hitherto come upon\r\nhim, and that was about to come on all those whom he loved so well,\r\narose from this lack of courage. He did not dare to tell his son that\r\nhe advised him for the present to put aside all such hopes. It would\r\nhave been terrible for him to do so; but he knew that in not doing so\r\nhe was occasioning sorrow that would be more terrible.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he did not do it. Herbert saw clearly that the project was\r\ndistasteful to his father,--that project which he had hoped to have\r\nseen received with so much delight; but nothing was said to him which\r\ntended to make him alter his purpose.\r\n\r\n"Do you not like her?" he asked his father, almost piteously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; I do like her, we all like her, very much indeed,\r\nHerbert."\r\n\r\n"Then why--"\r\n\r\n"You are so young, my boy, and she is so very young, and--"\r\n\r\n"And what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Herbert, it is not always practicable for the son even of a man\r\nof property to marry so early in life as this. She has nothing, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"No," said the young man, proudly; "I never thought of looking for\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"But in your position it is so essential if a young man wishes to\r\nmarry."\r\n\r\nHerbert had always regarded his father as the most liberal man\r\nbreathing,--as open-hearted and open-handed almost to a fault. To\r\nhim, his only son, he had ever been so, refusing him nothing, and\r\nlatterly allowing him to do almost as he would with the management\r\nof the estate. He could not understand that this liberality should\r\nbe turned to parsimony on such an occasion as that of his son\'s\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n"You think then, sir, that I ought not to marry Lady Clara?" said\r\nHerbert very bitterly.\r\n\r\n"I like her excessively," said Sir Thomas. "I think she is a sweet\r\ngirl, a very sweet girl, all that I or your mother could desire to\r\nsee in your wife; but--"\r\n\r\n"But she is not rich."\r\n\r\n"Do not speak to me in that tone, my boy," said Sir Thomas, with an\r\nexpression that would have moved his enemy to pity, let alone his\r\nson. His son did pity him, and ceased to wear the angry expression of\r\nface which had so wounded his father.\r\n\r\n"But, father, I do not understand you," he said. "Is there any real\r\nobjection why I should not marry? I am more than twenty-two, and you,\r\nI think, married earlier than that."\r\n\r\nIn answer to this Sir Thomas only sighed meekly and piteously.\r\n\r\n"If you mean to say," continued the son, "that it will be\r\ninconvenient to you to make me any allowance--"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no; you are of course entitled to what you want, and as long\r\nas I can give it, you shall have it."\r\n\r\n"As long as you can give it, father!"\r\n\r\n"As long as it is in my power, I mean. What can I want of anything\r\nbut for you--for you and them?"\r\n\r\nAfter this Herbert sat silent for a while, leaning on his arm. He\r\nknew that there existed some mischief, but he could not fathom\r\nit. Had he been prudent, he would have felt that there was some\r\nimpediment to his love; some evil which it behoved him to fathom\r\nbefore he allowed his love to share it; but when was a lover prudent?\r\n\r\n"We should live here, should we not, father? No second establishment\r\nwould be necessary."\r\n\r\n"Of course you would live here," said Sir Thomas, glad to be able to\r\nlook at the subject on any side that was not painful. "Of course you\r\nwould live here. For the matter of that, Herbert, the house should be\r\nconsidered as your own if you so wished it."\r\n\r\nAgainst this the son put in his most violent protest. Nothing on\r\nearth should make him consider himself master of Castle Richmond as\r\nlong as his father lived. Nor would Clara,--his Clara, wish it. He\r\nknew her well, he boasted. It would amply suffice to her to live\r\nthere with them all. Was not the house large enough? And, indeed,\r\nwhere else could he live, seeing that all his interests were\r\nnaturally centred upon the property?\r\n\r\nAnd then Sir Thomas did give his consent. It would be wrong to say\r\nthat it was wrung from him. He gave it willingly enough, as far\r\nas the present moment was concerned. When it was once settled, he\r\nassured his son that he would love Clara as his daughter. But,\r\nnevertheless--\r\n\r\nThe father knew that he had done wrong; and Herbert knew that he\r\nalso, he himself, had done wrongly. He was aware that there was\r\nsomething which he did not understand. But he had promised to see\r\nClara either that day or the next, and he could not bring himself\r\nto unsay all that he had said to her. He left his father\'s room\r\nsorrowful at heart, and discontented. He had expected that his\r\ntidings would have been received in so far other a manner; that he\r\nwould have been able to go from his father\'s study up stairs to his\r\nmother\'s room with so exulting a step; that his news, when once\r\nthe matter was ratified by his father\'s approval, would have flown\r\nabout the house with so loud a note of triumph. And now it was so\r\ndifferent! His father had consented; but it was too plain that there\r\nwas no room for any triumph.\r\n\r\n"Well, Herbert!" said Emmeline, jumping up to meet him as he returned\r\nto a small back drawing-room, through which he had gone to his\r\nfather\'s dressing-room. She had calculated that he would come there,\r\nand that she might thus get the first word from him after the\r\ninterview was over.\r\n\r\nBut there was a frown upon his brow, and displeasure in his eyes.\r\nThere was none of that bright smile of gratified pride with which\r\nshe had expected that her greeting would have been met. "Is there\r\nanything wrong?" she said. "He does not disapprove, does he?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind; and do leave me now. I never can make you understand\r\nthat one is not always in a humour for joking." And so saying, he put\r\nher aside, and passed on.\r\n\r\nJoking! That was indeed hard upon poor Emmeline, seeing that her\r\nthoughts were so full of him, that her heart beat so warmly for his\r\npromised bride. But she said nothing, shrinking back abashed, and\r\nvanishing out of the way. Could it be possible that her father should\r\nhave refused to receive Lady Clara Desmond as his daughter-in-law?\r\n\r\nHe then betook himself to a private territory of his own, where he\r\nmight be sure that he would remain undisturbed for some half-hour or\r\nso. He would go to his mother, of course, but not quite immediately.\r\nHe would think over the matter, endeavouring to ascertain what it was\r\nthat had made his father\'s manner and words so painful to him.\r\n\r\nBut he could not get his thoughts to work rightly;--which getting of\r\nthe thoughts to work rightly is, by-the-by, as I take it, the hardest\r\nwork which a man is called upon to do. Not that the subject to be\r\nthought about need in itself be difficult. Were one to say that\r\nthoughts about hydrostatics and pneumatics are difficult to the\r\nmultitude, or that mental efforts in regions of political economy\r\nor ethical philosophy are beyond ordinary reach, one would only\r\npronounce an evident truism, an absurd platitude. But let any man\r\ntake any subject fully within his own mind\'s scope, and strive to\r\nthink about it steadily, with some attempt at calculation as to\r\nresults. The chances are his mind will fly off, will-he-nill-he,\r\nto some utterly different matter. When he wishes to debate within\r\nhimself that question of his wife\'s temper, he will find himself\r\nconsidering whether he may not judiciously give away half a dozen\r\npairs of those old boots; or when it behoves him to decide whether it\r\nshall be manure and a green crop, or a fallow season and then grass\r\nseeds, he cannot keep himself from inward inquiry as to the meaning\r\nof that peculiar smile on Mrs. Walker\'s face when he shook hands with\r\nher last night.\r\n\r\nLord Brougham and Professor Faraday can, no doubt, command their\r\nthoughts. If many men could do so, there would be many Lord Broughams\r\nand many Professor Faradays.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment Herbert Fitzgerald had no right to consider\r\nhimself as following in the steps of either one or other of these\r\ngreat men. He wished to think about his father\'s circumstances, but\r\nhis mind would fly off to Clara Desmond and her perfections. And\r\nthus, though he remained there for half an hour, with his back to the\r\nfire and his hands in his pockets, his deliberations had done him no\r\ngood whatever,--had rather done him harm, seeing that he had only\r\nwarmed himself into a firmer determination to go on with what he was\r\ndoing. And then he went to his mother.\r\n\r\nShe kissed him, and spoke very tenderly, nay affectionately, about\r\nClara; but even she, even his mother, did not speak joyously; and she\r\nalso said something about the difficulty of providing a maintenance\r\nfor a married son. Then to her he burst forth, and spoke somewhat\r\nloudly.\r\n\r\n"I cannot understand all this, mother. If either you or my father\r\nknow any reason why I should be treated differently from other sons,\r\nyou ought to tell me; not leave me to grope about in the dark."\r\n\r\n"But, my boy, we both think that no son was ever entitled to more\r\nconsideration, or to kinder or more liberal treatment."\r\n\r\n"Why do I hear all this, then, about the difficulty of my marrying?\r\nOr if I hear so much, why do I not hear more? I know pretty well, I\r\nbelieve, what is my father\'s income."\r\n\r\n"If you do not, he would tell you for the asking."\r\n\r\n"And I know that I must be the heir to it, whatever it is,--not that\r\nthat feeling would make any difference in my dealings with him, not\r\nthe least. And, under these circumstances, I cannot conceive why he\r\nand you should look coldly upon my marriage."\r\n\r\n"I look coldly on it, Herbert!"\r\n\r\n"Do you not? Do you not tell me that there will be no income for me?\r\nIf that is to be so; if that really is the case; if the property has\r\nso dwindled away, or become embarrassed--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Herbert! there never was a man less likely to injure his son\'s\r\nproperty than your father."\r\n\r\n"I do not mean that, mother. Let him do what he likes with it,\r\nI should not upbraid him, even in my thoughts. But if it be\r\nembarrassed; if it has dwindled away; if there be any reason why\r\nI should not regard myself as altogether untrammelled with regard\r\nto money, he ought to tell me. I cannot accuse myself of expensive\r\ntastes."\r\n\r\n"Dearest Herbert, nobody accuses you of anything."\r\n\r\n"But I do desire to marry; and now I have engaged myself, and will\r\nnot break from my engagement, unless it be shown to me that I am\r\nbound in honour to do so. Then, indeed--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Herbert! I do not know what you mean."\r\n\r\n"I mean this: that I expect that Clara shall be received as my wife\r\nwith open arms--"\r\n\r\n"And so she shall be if she comes."\r\n\r\n"Or else that some reason should be given me why she should not come.\r\nAs to income, something must be done, I suppose. If the means at our\r\ndisposal are less than I have been taught to believe, I at any rate\r\nwill not complain. But they cannot, I think, be so small as to afford\r\nany just reason why I should not marry."\r\n\r\n"Your father, you see, is ill, and one can hardly talk to him fully\r\nupon such matters at present."\r\n\r\n"Then I will speak to Somers. He, at any rate, must know how the\r\nproperty is circumstanced, and I suppose he will not hesitate to tell\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think Somers can tell you anything."\r\n\r\n"Then what is it? As for the London estate, mother, that is all\r\nmoonshine. What if it were gone altogether? It may be that it is that\r\nwhich vexes my father; but if so, it is a monomania."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my boy, do not use such a word!"\r\n\r\n"You know what I mean. If any doubt as to that is creating this\r\ndespondency, it only shows that though we are bound to respect and\r\nrelieve my father\'s state of mind, we are not at all bound to share\r\nit. What would it really matter, mother, if that place in London were\r\nwashed away by the Thames? There is more than enough left for us all,\r\nunless--"\r\n\r\n"Ah, Herbert, that is it."\r\n\r\n"Then I will go to Somers, and he shall tell me. My father\'s interest\r\nin this property cannot have been involved without his knowledge; and\r\ncircumstanced as we and my father are, he is bound to tell me."\r\n\r\n"If there be anything within his knowledge to tell, he will tell it."\r\n\r\n"And if there be nothing within his knowledge, then I can only look\r\nupon all this as a disease on my poor father\'s part. I will do all I\r\ncan to comfort him in it; but it would be madness to destroy my whole\r\nhappiness because he labours under delusions."\r\n\r\nLady Fitzgerald did not know what further to say. She half believed\r\nthat Sir Thomas did labour under some delusion; but then she half\r\nbelieved also that he had upon his mind a sorrow, terribly real,\r\nwhich was in no sort delusive. Under such circumstances, how could\r\nshe advise her son? Instead of advising him, she caressed him.\r\n\r\n"But I may claim this from you, mother, that if Somers tells me\r\nnothing which ought to make me break my word to Clara, you will\r\nreceive her as your daughter. You will promise me that, will you\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\nLady Fitzgerald did promise, warmly; assuring him that she already\r\ndearly loved Clara Desmond, that she would delight in having such\r\na daughter-in-law, and that she would go to her to welcome her as\r\nsuch as soon as ever he should bid her do so. With this Herbert was\r\nsomewhat comforted, and immediately started on his search after Mr.\r\nSomers.\r\n\r\nI do not think that any person is to be found, as a rule, attached\r\nto English estates whose position is analogous to that of an Irish\r\nagent. And there is a wide misunderstanding in England as to these\r\nIrish functionaries. I have attempted, some pages back, to describe\r\nthe national delinquencies of a middleman, or profit-renter. In\r\nEngland we are apt to think that the agents on Irish properties are\r\nto be charged with similar shortcomings. This I can assert to be a\r\ngreat mistake; and I believe that, as a class, the agents on Irish\r\nproperties do their duty in a manner beneficial to the people.\r\n\r\nThat there are, or were, many agents who were also middlemen, or\r\nprofit-renters, and that in this second position they were a nuisance\r\nto the country, is no doubt true. But they were no nuisance in their\r\nworking capacity as agents. That there are some bad agents there can\r\nbe no doubt, as there are also some bad shoemakers.\r\n\r\nThe duties towards an estate which an agent performs in Ireland\r\nare, I believe, generally shared in England between three or four\r\ndifferent persons. The family lawyer performs part, the estate\r\nsteward performs part, and the landlord himself performs part;--as to\r\nsmall estates, by far the greater part.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, let the estate be ever so small--eight hundred a year we\r\nwill say--all the working of the property is managed by the agent. It\r\nis he who knows the tenants, and the limits of their holdings; it is\r\nhe who arranges leases, and allows--or much more generally does not\r\nallow--for improvements. He takes the rent, and gives the order for\r\nthe ejection of tenants if he cannot get it.\r\n\r\nI am far from saying that it would not be well that much of this\r\nshould be done by the landlord himself;--that all of it should be so\r\ndone on a small property. But it is done by agents; and, as a rule\r\nis, I think, done honestly.\r\n\r\nMr. Somers was agent to the Castle Richmond property, and as he took\r\nto himself as such five per cent. on all rents paid, and as he was\r\nagent also to sundry other small properties in the neighbourhood,\r\nhe succeeded in making a very snug income. He had also an excellent\r\nhouse on the estate, and was altogether very much thought of; on the\r\nwhole, perhaps, more than was Sir Thomas. But in this respect it was\r\nprobable that Herbert might soon take the lead.\r\n\r\nHe was a large, heavy, consequential man, always very busy, as though\r\naware of being one of the most important wheels that kept the Irish\r\nclock agoing; but he was honest, kind-hearted in the main, true as\r\nsteel to his employers, and good-humoured--as long as he was allowed\r\nto have his own way. In these latter days he had been a little soured\r\nby Herbert\'s interference, and had even gone so far as to say that,\r\n"in his humble judgment, Mr. Fitzgerald was wrong in doing"--so and\r\nso. But he generally called him Herbert, was always kind to him, and\r\nin his heart of hearts loved him dearly. But that was a matter of\r\ncourse, for had he not been agent to the estate before Herbert was\r\nborn?\r\n\r\nImmediately after his interview with his mother, Mr. Herbert rode\r\nover to Mr. Somers\'s house, and there found him sitting alone in his\r\noffice. He dashed immediately into the subject that had brought him\r\nthere. "I have come, Mr. Somers," said he, "to ask you a question\r\nabout the property."\r\n\r\n"About the Castle Richmond property?" said Mr. Somers, rather\r\nsurprised by his visitor\'s manner.\r\n\r\n"Yes; you know in what a state my poor father now is."\r\n\r\n"I know that Sir Thomas is not very well. I am sorry to say that it\r\nis long since he has been quite himself."\r\n\r\n"There is something that is preying upon his spirits."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid so, Herbert."\r\n\r\n"Then tell me fairly, Mr. Somers, do you know what it is?"\r\n\r\n"Not--in--the least. I have no conception whatever, and never have\r\nhad any. I know no cause for trouble that should disquiet him."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing wrong about the property?"\r\n\r\n"Not to my knowledge."\r\n\r\n"Who has the title-deeds?"\r\n\r\n"They are at Coutts\'s."\r\n\r\n"You are sure of that?"\r\n\r\n"Well; as sure as a man can be of a thing that he does not see. I\r\nhave never seen them there; indeed, have never seen them at all; but\r\nI feel no doubt in my own mind as to their being at the bankers."\r\n\r\n"Is there much due on the estate?"\r\n\r\n"Very little. No estate in county Cork has less on it. Miss Letty has\r\nher income, and when Poulnasherry was bought,--that townland lying\r\njust under Berryhill, where the gorse cover is, part of the purchase\r\nmoney was left on mortgage. That is still due; but the interest is\r\nless than a hundred a year."\r\n\r\n"And that is all?"\r\n\r\n"All that I know of."\r\n\r\n"Could there be encumbrances without your knowing it?"\r\n\r\n"I think not. I think it is impossible. Of all men your father is the\r\nlast to encumber his estates in a manner unknown to his agent, and to\r\npay off the interest in secret."\r\n\r\n"What is it then, Mr. Somers?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know." And then Mr. Somers paused. "Of course you have\r\nheard of a visit he received the other day from a stranger?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I heard of it."\r\n\r\n"People about here are talking of it. And he--that man, with\r\na younger man--they are still living in Cork, at a little\r\ndrinking-house in South Main Street. The younger man has been seen\r\ndown here twice."\r\n\r\n"But what can that mean?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. I tell you everything that I do know."\r\n\r\nHerbert exacted a promise from him that he would continue to tell him\r\neverything which he might learn, and then rode back to Castle\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n"The whole thing must be a delusion," he said to himself; and\r\nresolved that there was no valid reason why he should make Clara\r\nunhappy by any reference to the circumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMR. MOLLETT RETURNS TO SOUTH MAIN STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must now take my readers back to that very unsavoury public-house\r\nin South Main Street, Cork, in which, for the present, lived Mr.\r\nMatthew Mollett and his son Abraham.\r\n\r\nI need hardly explain to a discerning public that Mr. Matthew Mollett\r\nwas the gentleman who made that momentous call at Castle Richmond,\r\nand flurried all that household.\r\n\r\n"Drat it!" said Mrs. Jones to herself on that day, as soon as she\r\nhad regained the solitude of her own private apartment, after having\r\ntaken a long look at Mr. Mollett in the hall. On that occasion she\r\nsat down on a low chair in the middle of the room, put her two hands\r\ndown substantially on her two knees, gave a long sigh, and then made\r\nthe above exclamation,--"Drat it!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones was still thoroughly a Saxon, although she had lived for\r\nso many years among the Celts. But it was only when she was quite\r\nalone that she allowed herself the indulgence of so peculiarly Saxon\r\na mode of expressing either her surprise or indignation.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the same man," she said to herself, "as come that day, as sure\r\nas eggs;" and then for five minutes she maintained her position,\r\ncogitating. "And he\'s like the other fellow too," she continued.\r\n"Only, somehow he\'s not like him." And then another pause. "And yet\r\nhe is; only it can\'t be; and he ain\'t just so tall, and he\'s older\r\nlike." And then, still meditating, Mrs. Jones kept her position for\r\nfull ten minutes longer; at the end of which time she got up and\r\nshook herself. She deserved to be bracketed with Lord Brougham and\r\nProfessor Faraday, for she had kept her mind intent on her subject,\r\nand had come to a resolution. "I won\'t say nothing to nobody,\r\nnoways," was the expression of her mind\'s purpose. "Only I\'ll tell\r\nmissus as how he was the man as come to Wales." And she did tell so\r\nmuch to her mistress--as we have before learned.\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett had gone down from Cork to Castle Richmond in one\r\nof those delightful Irish vehicles called a covered car. An\r\ninside-covered car is an equipage much given to shaking, seeing that\r\nit has a heavy top like a London cab, and that it runs on a pair of\r\nwheels. It is entered from behind, and slopes backwards. The sitter\r\nsits sideways, between a cracked window on one side and a cracked\r\ndoorway on the other; and as a draught is always going in at the ear\r\nnext the window, and out at the ear next the door, it is about as\r\ncold and comfortless a vehicle for winter as may be well imagined.\r\nNow the journey from Castle Richmond to Cork has to be made right\r\nacross the Boggeragh Mountains. It is over twenty miles Irish; and\r\nthe road is never very good. Mr. Mollett, therefore, was five hours\r\nin the covered car on his return journey; and as he had stopped for\r\nlunch at Kanturk, and had not hurried himself at that meal, it was\r\nvery dark and very cold when he reached the house in South Main\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nI think I have explained that Mr. Mollett senior was not absolutely\r\na drunkard; but nevertheless, he was not averse to spirits in cold\r\nweather, and on this journey had warmed himself with whisky once or\r\ntwice on the road. He had found a shebeen house when he crossed the\r\nNad river, and another on the mountain-top, and a third at the point\r\nwhere the road passes near the village of Blarney, and at all these\r\nconvenient resting-spots Mr. Mollett had endeavoured to warm himself.\r\n\r\nThere are men who do not become absolutely drunk, but who do become\r\nabsolutely cross when they drink more than is good for them; and of\r\nsuch men Mr. Mollett was one. What with the cold air, and what with\r\nthe whisky, and what with the jolting, Mr. Mollett was very cross\r\nwhen he reached the Kanturk Hotel, so that he only cursed the driver\r\ninstead of giving him the expected gratuity.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come to yer honour in the morning," said the driver.\r\n\r\n"You may go to the devil in the morning," answered Mr. Mollett; and\r\nthis was the first intimation of his return which reached the ears of\r\nhis expectant son.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the governor," said Aby, who was then flirting with Miss\r\nO\'Dwyer in the bar. "Somebody\'s been stroking him the wrong way of\r\nthe \'air."\r\n\r\nThe charms of Miss O\'Dwyer in these idle days had been too much for\r\nthe prudence of Mr. Abraham Mollett; by far too much, considering\r\nthat in his sterner moments his ambition led him to contemplate a\r\nmatch with a young lady of much higher rank in life. But wine, which\r\n"inspires us" and fires us\r\n\r\n\r\n   "With courage, love, and joy,"\r\n\r\n\r\nhad inspired him with courage to forget his prudence, and with love\r\nfor the lovely Fanny.\r\n\r\n"Now, nonsense, Mr. Aby," she had said to him a few minutes before\r\nthe wheels of the covered car were heard in South Main Street. "You\r\nknow you main nothing of the sort."\r\n\r\n"By \'eavens, Fanny, I mean every word of it; may this drop be my\r\npoison if I don\'t. This piece of business here keeps me and the\r\ngovernor hon and hoff like, and will do for some weeks perhaps; but\r\nwhen that\'s done, honly say the word, and I\'ll make you Mrs. M. Isn\'t\r\nthat fair now?"\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Aby--"\r\n\r\n"Never mind the mister, Fan, between friends."\r\n\r\n"La! I couldn\'t call you Aby without it; could I?"\r\n\r\n"Try, my darling."\r\n\r\n"Well--Aby--there now. It does sound so uppish, don\'t it? But tell\r\nme this now; what is the business that you and the old gentleman is\r\nabout down at Kanturk?"\r\n\r\nAbraham Mollett hereupon had put one finger to his nose, and then\r\nwinked his eye.\r\n\r\n"If you care about me, as you say you do, you wouldn\'t be shy of just\r\ntelling me as much as that."\r\n\r\n"That\'s business, Fan; and business and love don\'t hamalgamate like\r\nwhisky and sugar."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll tell you what it is, Mr. Aby; I don\'t want to have\r\nanything to do with a man who won\'t show his rispect by telling me\r\nhis sacrets."\r\n\r\n"That\'s it, is it, Fan?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose you think I can\'t keep a sacret. You think I\'d be telling\r\nfather, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s about some money that\'s due to him down there."\r\n\r\n"Who from?"\r\n\r\n"He expects to get it from some of those Fitzgerald people."\r\n\r\nIn saying so much Mr. Mollett the younger had not utterly abandoned\r\nall prudence. He knew very well that the car-driver and others would\r\nbe aware that his father had been to Castle Richmond; and that it was\r\nmore than probable that either he or his father would have to make\r\nfurther visits there. Indeed, he had almost determined that he would\r\ngo down to the baronet himself. Under these circumstances it might be\r\nwell that some pretext for these visits should be given.\r\n\r\n"Which Fitzgerald, Mr. Aby? Is it the Hap House young man?"\r\n\r\n"Hap House. I never heard of such a place. These people live at\r\nCastle Richmond."\r\n\r\n"Oh--h--h! If Mr. Mollett have money due there, sure he have a good\r\nmark to go upon. Why, Sir Thomas is about the richest man in these\r\nparts."\r\n\r\n"And who is this other man; at \'Appy--what is it you call his place?"\r\n\r\n"Hap House. Oh, it\'s he is the thorough-going young gentleman.\r\nOnly they say he\'s a leetle too fast. To my mind, Mr. Owen is the\r\nfinest-looking man to be seen anywhere\'s in the county Cork."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a flame of yours, is he, Fan?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you main by a flame. But there\'s not a girl in\r\nCork but what likes the glance of his eye. They do say that he\'d have\r\nLady Clara Desmond; only there ain\'t no money."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s he to these other people?"\r\n\r\n"Cousin, I believe; or hardly so much as that, I\'m thinking. But all\r\nthe same if anything was to happen to young Mr. Herbert, it would all\r\ngo to him."\r\n\r\n"It would, would it?"\r\n\r\n"So people say."\r\n\r\n"Mr. \'Erbert is the son of the old cock at Castle Richmond, isn\'t\r\nhe?"\r\n\r\n"Just so. He\'s the young cock; he, he, he!"\r\n\r\n"And if he was to be--nowhere like; not his father\'s son at all, for\r\ninstance, it would all go to this \'andsome \'Appy \'Ouse man; would\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Every shilling, they say; house, title, and all."\r\n\r\n"Hum," said Mr. Abraham Mollett; and he began again to calculate his\r\nfamily chances. Perhaps, after all, this handsome young man who was\r\nat present too poor to marry his noble lady love might be the more\r\nliberal man to deal with. But then any dealings with him would kill\r\nthe golden goose at once. All would depend on the size of the one egg\r\nwhich might be extracted.\r\n\r\nHe certainly felt, however, that this Fitzgerald family arrangement\r\nwas one which it was beneficial that he should know; but he felt also\r\nthat it would be by no means necessary at present to communicate the\r\ninformation to his father. He put it by in his mind, regarding it as\r\na fund on which he might draw if occasion should require. It might\r\nperhaps be pleasant for him to make the acquaintance of this \'andsome\r\nyoung Fitzgerald of \'Appy \'Ouse.\r\n\r\n"And now, Fan, my darling, give us a kiss," said he, getting up from\r\nhis seat.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed and I won\'t," said Fan, withdrawing herself among the bottles\r\nand glasses.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed and you shall, my love," said Aby, pertinaciously, as he\r\nprepared to follow her through the brittle ware.\r\n\r\n"Hu--sh--be aisy now. There\'s Tom. He\'s ears for everything, and eyes\r\nlike a cat."\r\n\r\n"What do I care for Tom?"\r\n\r\n"And father \'ll be coming in. Be aisy, I tell you. I won\'t now, Mr.\r\nAby; and that\'s enough. You\'ll break the bottle."\r\n\r\n"D---- the bottle. That\'s smashed hany way. Come, Fan, what\'s a kiss\r\namong friends?"\r\n\r\n"Cock you up with kisses, indeed! how bad you are for dainties!\r\nThere; do you hear that? That\'s the old gentleman;" and then, as the\r\nvoice of Mr. Mollett senior was heard abusing the car-driver, Miss\r\nO\'Dwyer smoothed her apron, put her hands to her side hair, and\r\nremoved the debris of the broken bottle.\r\n\r\n"Well, governor," said Aby, "how goes it?"\r\n\r\n"How goes it, indeed! It goes pretty well, I dare say, in here, where\r\nyou can sit drinking toddy all the evening, and doing nothing."\r\n\r\n"Why, what on hearth would you have me be doing? Better here than\r\npaddling about in the streets, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"If you could do a stroke of work now and then to earn your bread,\r\nit might be better." Now Aby knew from experience that whenever his\r\nfather talked to him about earning his bread, he was half drunk and\r\nwhole cross. So he made no immediate reply on that point.\r\n\r\n"You are cold I suppose, governor, and had better get a bit of\r\nsomething to eat, and a little tea."\r\n\r\n"And put my feet in hot water, and tallow my nose, and go to bed,\r\nhadn\'t I? Miss O\'Dwyer, I\'ll trouble you to mix me a glass of\r\nbrandy-punch. Of all the roads I ever travelled, that\'s the longest\r\nand hardest to get over. Dashed, if I didn\'t begin to think I\'d never\r\nbe here." And so saying he flung himself into a chair, and put up his\r\nfeet on the two hobs.\r\n\r\nThere was a kettle on one of them, which the young lady pushed a\r\nlittle nearer to the hot coals, in order to show that the water\r\nshould be boiling; and as she did so Aby gave her a wink over his\r\nfather\'s shoulder, by way of conveying to her an intimation that "the\r\ngovernor was a little cut," or in other language tipsy, and that the\r\nbrandy-punch should be brewed with a discreet view to past events of\r\nthe same description. All which Miss O\'Dwyer perfectly understood.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be conceived that Aby was especially anxious to\r\nreceive tidings of what had been done this day down in the Kanturk\r\nneighbourhood. He had given his views to his father, as will be\r\nremembered; and though Mr. Mollett senior had not professed himself\r\nas absolutely agreeing with them, he had nevertheless owned that he\r\nwas imbued with the necessity of taking some great step. He had gone\r\ndown to take this great step, and Aby was very anxious to know how it\r\nhad been taken.\r\n\r\nWhen the father and son were both sober, or when the son was tipsy,\r\nor when the father was absolutely drunk--an accident which would\r\noccur occasionally, the spirit and pluck of the son was in the\r\nascendant. He at such times was the more masterful of the two, and\r\ngenerally contrived, either by persuasion or bullying, to govern his\r\ngovernor. But when it did happen that Mollett p\xe8re was half drunk\r\nand cross with drink, then, at such moments, Mollett fils had to\r\nacknowledge to himself that his governor was not to be governed.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, at such moments his governor could be very\r\ndisagreeable--could say nasty, bitter things, showing very little\r\nparental affection, and make himself altogether bad society, not only\r\nto his son, but to his son\'s companions also. Now it appeared to Aby\r\nthat his father was at present in this condition.\r\n\r\nHe had only to egg him on to further drinking, and the respectable\r\ngentleman would become stupid, noisy, soft, and affectionate. But\r\nthen, when in that state, he would blab terribly. It was much with\r\nthe view of keeping him from that state, that under the present\r\ncircumstances the son remained with the father. To do the father\r\njustice, it may be asserted that he knew his own weakness, and that,\r\nknowing it, he had abstained from heavy drinking since he had taken\r\nin hand this great piece of diplomacy.\r\n\r\n"But you must be hungry, governor; won\'t you take a bit of\r\nsomething?"\r\n\r\n"Shall we get you a steek, Mr. Mollett?" asked Miss O\'Dwyer,\r\nhospitably, "or just a bit of bacon with a couple of eggs or so? It\r\nwouldn\'t be a minute, you know?"\r\n\r\n"Your eggs are all addled and bad," said Mr. Mollett; "and as for a\r\nbeef-steak, it\'s my belief there isn\'t such a thing in all Ireland."\r\nAfter which civil speech, Miss O\'Dwyer winked at Aby, as much as to\r\nsay, "You see what a state he\'s in."\r\n\r\n"Have a bit of buttered toast and a cup of tea, governor," suggested\r\nthe son.\r\n\r\n"I\'m d---- if I do," replied the father. "You\'re become uncommon fond\r\nof tea of late--that is, for other people. I don\'t see you take much\r\nof it yourself."\r\n\r\n"A cup of tay is the thing to warm one afther such a journey as\r\nyou\'ve had; that\'s certain, Mr. Mollett," said Fanny.\r\n\r\n"Them\'s your ideas about warming, are they, my dear?" said the\r\nelderly gentleman. "Do you come and sit down on my knee here for a\r\nfew minutes or so, and that\'d warm me better than all the \'tay\' in\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\nAby showed by his face that he was immeasurably disgusted by the\r\niniquitous coarseness of this overture. Miss O\'Dwyer, however,\r\nlooking at the gentleman\'s age, and his state as regarded liquor,\r\npassed it over as of no moment whatsoever. So that when, in the\r\nlater part of the evening, Aby expressed to that young lady his deep\r\ndisgust, she merely said, "Oh, bother; what matters an old man like\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\nAnd then, when they were at this pass, Mr. O\'Dwyer came in. He did\r\nnot interfere much with his daughter in the bar room, but he would\r\noccasionally take a dandy of punch there, and ask how things were\r\ngoing on in doors. He was a fat, thickset man, with a good-humoured\r\nface, a flattened nose, and a great aptitude for stable occupations.\r\nHe was part owner of the Kanturk car, as has been before said, and\r\nwas the proprietor of sundry other cars, open cars and covered cars,\r\nplying for hire in the streets of Cork.\r\n\r\n"I hope the mare took your honour well down to Kanturk and back\r\nagain," said he, addressing his elder customer with a chuck of his\r\nhead intended for a bow.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you call well," said Mr. Mollett. "She hadn\'t a\r\nleg to stand upon for the last three hours."\r\n\r\n"Not a leg to stand upon! Faix, then, and it\'s she\'d have the four\r\ngood legs if she travelled every inch of the way from Donagh-a-Dee to\r\nTi-vora," to which distance Mr. O\'Dwyer specially referred as being\r\nsupposed to be the longest known in Ireland.\r\n\r\n"She may be able to do that; but I\'m blessed if she\'s fit to go to\r\nKanturk and back."\r\n\r\n"She\'s done the work, anyhow," said Mr. O\'Dwyer, who evidently\r\nthought that this last argument was conclusive.\r\n\r\n"And a precious time she\'s been about it. Why, my goodness, it would\r\nhave been better for me to have walked it. As Sir Thomas said to\r\nme--"\r\n\r\n"What! did you see Sir Thomas Fitzgerald?"\r\n\r\nHereupon Aby gave his father a nudge; but the father either did not\r\nappreciate the nudge, or did not choose to obey it.\r\n\r\n"Yes; I did see him. Why shouldn\'t I?"\r\n\r\n"Only they do say he\'s hard to get to speak to now-a-days. He\'s not\r\nover well, you know, these years back."\r\n\r\n"Well or ill he\'ll see me, I take it, when I go that distance to ask\r\nhim. There\'s no doubt about that; is there, Aby?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t say, I\'m sure, not knowing the gentleman," said Aby.\r\n\r\n"We holds land from Sir Thomas, we do; that is, me and my brother\r\nMick, and a better landlord ain\'t nowhere," said Mr. O\'Dwyer.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'re one of the tenants, are you? The rents are paid pretty\r\nwell, ain\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"To the day," said Mr. O\'Dwyer, proudly.\r\n\r\n"What would you think now--" Mr. Mollett was continuing; but Aby\r\ninterrupted him somewhat violently.\r\n\r\n"Hold your confounded stupid tongue, will you, you old jolterhead;"\r\nand on this occasion he put his hand on his father\'s shoulder and\r\nshook him.\r\n\r\n"Who are you calling jolterhead? Who do you dare to speak to in that\r\nway? you impudent young cub you. Am I to ask your leave when I want\r\nto open my mouth?"\r\n\r\nAby had well known that his father in his present mood would not\r\nstand the manner in which the interruption was attempted. Nor did he\r\nwish to quarrel before the publican and his daughter. But anything\r\nwas better than allowing his father to continue in the strain in\r\nwhich he was talking.\r\n\r\n"You are talking of things which you don\'t hunderstand, and about\r\npeople you don\'t know," said Aby. "You\'ve had a drop too much on the\r\nroad too, and you \'ad better go to bed."\r\n\r\nOld Mollett turned round to strike at his son; but even in his\r\npresent state he was somewhat quelled by Aby\'s eye. Aby was keenly\r\nalive to the necessity for prudence on his father\'s part, though he\r\nwas by no means able to be prudent himself.\r\n\r\n"Talking of things which I don\'t understand, am I?" said the old man.\r\n"That\'s all you know about it. Give me another glass of that brandy\r\ntoddy, my dear."\r\n\r\nBut Aby\'s look had quelled, or at any rate silenced him; and though\r\nhe did advance another stage in tipsiness before they succeeded in\r\ngetting him off to bed, he said no more about Sir Thomas Fitzgerald\r\nor his Castle Richmond secrets.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he had said enough to cause suspicion. One would not\r\nhave imagined, on looking at Mr. O\'Dwyer, that he was a very crafty\r\nperson, or one of whose finesse in affairs of the world it would be\r\nnecessary to stand much in awe. He seemed to be thick, and stolid,\r\nand incapable of deep inquiry; but, nevertheless, he was as fond\r\nof his neighbours\' affairs as another, and knew as much about the\r\naffairs of his neighbours at Kanturk as any man in the county Cork.\r\n\r\nHe himself was a Kanturk man, and his wife had been a Kanturk woman;\r\nno less a person, indeed, than the sister of Father Bernard M\'Carthy,\r\nrest her soul;--for it was now at peace, let us all hope. She had\r\nbeen dead these ten years; but he did not the less keep up his\r\nconnection with the old town, or with his brother-in-law the priest,\r\nor with the affairs of the persons there adjacent; especially, we\r\nmay say, those of his landlord, Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, under whom he\r\nstill held a small farm, in conjunction with his brother Mick, the\r\npublican at Kanturk.\r\n\r\n"What\'s all that about Sir Thomas?" said he to his daughter in a low\r\nvoice as soon as the Molletts had left the bar.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t just know," said Fanny. She was a good daughter, and\r\nloved her father, whose indoor affairs she kept tight enough for him.\r\nBut she had hardly made up her mind as yet whether or no it would\r\nsuit her to be Mrs. Abraham Mollett. Should such be her destiny, it\r\nmight be as well for her not to talk about her husband\'s matters.\r\n\r\n"Is it true that the old man did see Sir Thomas to-day?"\r\n\r\n"You heard what passed, father; but I suppose it is true."\r\n\r\n"And the young \'un has been down to Kanturk two or three times. What\r\ncan the like of them have to do with Sir Thomas?"\r\n\r\nTo this Fanny could only say that she knew nothing about it, which\r\nin the main was true. Aby, indeed, had said that his father had gone\r\ndown to collect money that was due to him; but then Fanny did not\r\nbelieve all that Aby said.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like that young \'un at all," continued Mr. O\'Dwyer. "He\'s a\r\nnasty, sneaking fellow, as cares for no one but his own belly. I\'m\r\nnot over fond of the old \'un neither."\r\n\r\n"They is both free enough with their money, father," said the prudent\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they is welcome in the way of business, in course. But look\r\nhere, Fan; don\'t you have nothing to say to that Aby; do you hear\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Who? I? ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very well laughing; but mind what I says, for I won\'t have\r\nit. He is a nasty, sneaking, good-for-nothing fellow, besides being a\r\nheretic. What\'d your uncle Bernard say?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! for the matter of that, if I took a liking to a fellow I\r\nshouldn\'t ask Uncle Bernard what he had to say. If he didn\'t like it,\r\nI suppose he might do the other thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t have it. Do you hear that?"\r\n\r\n"Laws, father, what nonsense you do talk. Who\'s thinking about the\r\nman? He comes here for what he wants to ate and dhrink, and I suppose\r\nthe house is free to him as another. If not we\'d betther just shut up\r\nthe front door." After which she tossed herself up and began to wipe\r\nher glasses in a rather dignified manner.\r\n\r\nMr. O\'Dwyer sat smoking his pipe and chewing the cud of his\r\nreflections. "They ain\'t afther no good; I\'m sure of that." In saying\r\nwhich, however, he referred to the doings of the Molletts down at\r\nKanturk, rather than to any amatory proceedings which might have\r\ntaken place between the young man and his daughter.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Mr. Mollett senior awoke with a racking\r\nheadache. My belief is, that when men pay this penalty for drinking,\r\nthey are partly absolved from other penalties. The penalties on\r\ndrink are various. I mean those which affect the body, exclusive of\r\nthose which affect the mind. There are great red swollen noses, very\r\ndisagreeable both to the wearer and his acquaintances; there are\r\nmorning headaches, awful to be thought of; there are sick stomachs,\r\nby which means the offender escapes through a speedy purgatory; there\r\nare sallow cheeks, sunken eyes, and shaking shoulders; there are very\r\nbig bellies, and no bellies at all; and there is delirium tremens.\r\nFor the most part a man escapes with one of these penalties. If he\r\nhave a racking headache, his general health does not usually suffer\r\nso much as though he had endured no such immediate vengeance from\r\nviolated nature. Young Aby when he drank had no headaches; but his\r\neye was bloodshot, his cheek bloated, and his hand shook. His father,\r\non the other hand, could not raise his head after a debauch; but\r\nwhen that was gone, all ill results of his imprudence seemed to have\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nAt about noon on that day Aby was sitting by his father\'s bedside. Up\r\nto that time it had been quite impossible to induce him to speak a\r\nword. He could only groan, swallow soda-water with "hairs of the dog\r\nthat bit him" in it, and lay with his head between his arms. But soon\r\nafter noon Aby did induce him to say a word or two. The door of the\r\nroom was closely shut, the little table was strewed with soda-water\r\nbottles and last drops of small goes of brandy. Aby himself had a\r\ncigar in his mouth, and on the floor near the bed-foot was a plate\r\nwith a cold, greasy mutton chop, Aby having endeavoured in vain\r\nto induce his father to fortify exhausted nature by eating. The\r\nappearance of the room and the air within it would not have been\r\npleasant to fastidious people. But then the Molletts were not\r\nfastidious.\r\n\r\n"You did see Sir Thomas, then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did see him. I wish, Aby, you\'d let me lie just for another\r\nhour or so. I\'d be all right then. The jolting of that confounded car\r\nhas nearly shaken my head to pieces."\r\n\r\nBut Aby was by no means inclined to be so merciful. The probability\r\nwas that he would be able to pump his father more thoroughly in his\r\npresent weak state than he might do in a later part of the afternoon;\r\nso he persevered.\r\n\r\n"But, governor, it\'s so important we should know what we\'re about.\r\nDid you see any one else except himself?"\r\n\r\n"I saw them all I believe, except her. I was told she never showed\r\nin the morning; but I\'m blessed if I don\'t think I saw the skirt of\r\nher dress through an open door. I\'ll tell you what, Aby, I could not\r\nstand that."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps, father, after hall it\'ll be better I should manage the\r\nbusiness down there."\r\n\r\n"I believe there won\'t be much more to manage. But, Aby, do leave me\r\nnow, there\'s a good fellow; then in another hour or so I\'ll get up,\r\nand we\'ll have it all out."\r\n\r\n"When you\'re out in the open air and comfortable, it won\'t be fair\r\nto be bothering you with business. Come, governor, ten minutes will\r\ntell the whole of it if you\'ll only mind your eye. How did you begin\r\nwith Sir Thomas?" And then Aby went to the door, opened it very\r\ngently, and satisfied himself that there was nobody listening on the\r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett sighed wearily, but he knew that his only hope was to get\r\nthis job of talking over. "What was it you were saying, Aby?"\r\n\r\n"How did you begin with Sir Thomas?"\r\n\r\n"How did I begin with him? Let me see. Oh! I just told him who I was;\r\nand then he turned away and looked down under the fire like, and I\r\nthought he was going to make a faint of it."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t suppose he would be very glad to see you, governor."\r\n\r\n"When I saw how badly he took it, and how wretched he seemed, I\r\nalmost made up my mind to go away and never trouble him any more."\r\n\r\n"You did, did you?"\r\n\r\n"And just to take what he\'d choose to give me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, them\'s your hideas, hare they? Then I tell you what; I shall\r\njust take the matter into my own hands hentirely. You have no more\r\n\'eart than a chicken."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that\'s very well, Aby; but you did not see him."\r\n\r\n"Do you think that would make hany difference? When a man\'s a job of\r\nwork to do, \'e should do it. Them\'s my notions. Do you think a man\r\nlike that is to go and hact in that way, and then not pay for it?\r\nWhose wife is she I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\nThere was a tone of injured justice about Aby which almost roused the\r\nfather to participate in the son\'s indignation. "Well; I did my best,\r\nthough the old gentleman was in such a taking," said he.\r\n\r\n"And what was your best? Come, out with it at once."\r\n\r\n"I--m-m. I--just told him who I was, you know."\r\n\r\n"I guess he understood that quite well."\r\n\r\n"And then I said things weren\'t going exactly well with me."\r\n\r\n"You shouldn\'t have said that at all. What matters that to him? What\r\nyou hask for you hask for because you\'re able to demand it. That\'s\r\nthe ground for hus to take, and by ---- I\'ll take it too. There shall\r\nbe no \'alf-measures with me."\r\n\r\n"And then I told him--just what we were agreed, you know."\r\n\r\n"That we\'d go snacks in the whole concern?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t exactly say that."\r\n\r\n"Then what the devil did you say?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I told him that, looking at what the property was, twelve\r\nhundred pounds wasn\'t much."\r\n\r\n"I should think not either."\r\n\r\n"And that if his son was to be allowed to have it all--"\r\n\r\n"A bastard, you know, keeping it away from the proper heir." It may\r\nalmost be doubted whether, in so speaking, Aby did not almost think\r\nthat he himself had a legitimate right to inherit the property at\r\nCastle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"He must look to pay up handsome."\r\n\r\n"But did you say what \'andsome meant?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t--not then. He fell about upon the table like, and I\r\nwasn\'t quite sure he wouldn\'t make a die of it; and then heaven knows\r\nwhat might have happened to me."\r\n\r\n"Psha; you \'as no pluck, governor."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll tell you what it is, Aby, I ain\'t so sure you\'d have such an\r\nuncommon deal of pluck yourself."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll try, at any rate."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t such a pleasant thing to see an old gentleman in that\r\nstate. And what would happen if he chose to ring the bell and order\r\nthe police to take me? Have you ever thought of that?"\r\n\r\n"Gammon."\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t gammon. A word from him would put me into quod, and\r\nthere I should be for the rest of my days. But what would you care\r\nfor that?" And poor Mr. Mollett senior shook under the bedclothes\r\nas his attention became turned to this very dreary aspect of his\r\naffairs. "Pluck, indeed! I\'ll tell you what it is, Aby, I often\r\nwonder at my own pluck."\r\n\r\n"Psha! Wouldn\'t a word from you split upon him, and upon her, and\r\nupon the young \'un, and ruin \'em? Or a word from me either, for the\r\nmatter of that?"\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett senior shook again. He repented now, as he had already\r\ndone twenty times, that he had taken that son of his into his\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n"And what on hearth did you say to him?" continued Aby.\r\n\r\n"Well, not much more then; at least, not very much more. There was\r\na good deal of words, but they didn\'t seem to lead to much, except\r\nthis, just to make him understand that he must come down handsome."\r\n\r\n"And there was nothing done about Hemmiline?"\r\n\r\n"No," said the father, rather shortly.\r\n\r\n"If that was settled, that would be the clincher. There would be no\r\nfurther trouble to nobody then. It would be all smooth sailing for\r\nyour life, governor, and lots of tin."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what it is, Aby, you may just drop that, for I won\'t have\r\nthe young lady bothered about it, nor yet the young lady\'s father."\r\n\r\n"You won\'t, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t; so there\'s an end of it."\r\n\r\n"I suppose I may pay my distresses to any young lady if I think\r\nfitting."\r\n\r\n"And have yourself kicked into the ditch."\r\n\r\n"I know too much for kicking, governor."\r\n\r\n"They shall know as much as you do, and more too, if you go on with\r\nthat. There\'s a measure in all things. I won\'t have it done, so I\r\ntell you." And the father turned his face round to the wall.\r\n\r\nThis was by no means the end of the conversation, though we need not\r\nverbatim go through any more of it. It appeared that old Mollett\r\nhad told Sir Thomas that his permanent silence could be purchased\r\nby nothing short of a settled "genteel" income for himself and his\r\nson, no absolute sum having been mentioned; and that Sir Thomas had\r\nrequired a fortnight for his answer, which answer was to be conveyed\r\nto Mr. Mollett verbally at the end of that time. It was agreed that\r\nMr. Mollett should repeat his visit to Castle Richmond on that day\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n"In the mean time I\'ll go down and freshen the old gentleman up a\r\nbit," said Aby, as he left his father\'s bedroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE REJECTED SUITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the interview between Herbert and his mother, it became an\r\nunderstood thing at Castle Richmond that he was engaged to Lady\r\nClara. Sir Thomas raised no further objection, although it was clear\r\nto all the immediate family that he was by no means gratified at his\r\nson\'s engagement. Very little more passed between Sir Thomas and Lady\r\nFitzgerald on the subject. He merely said that he would consider the\r\nquestion of his son\'s income, and expressed a hope, or perhaps an\r\nopinion rather than a hope, that the marriage would not take place\r\nquite immediately.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Herbert hardly spoke further to his father\r\nupon the matter. He certainly did feel sore that he should be so\r\ntreated--that he should be made to understand that there was a\r\ndifficulty, but that the difficulty could not be explained to him.\r\nNo absolute opposition was however made, and he would not therefore\r\ncomplain. As to money, he would say nothing till something should be\r\nsaid to him.\r\n\r\nWith his mother, however, the matter was different. She had said that\r\nshe would welcome Clara; and she did so. Immediately after speaking\r\nto Sir Thomas she drove over to Desmond Court, and said soft, sweet\r\nthings to Clara in her most winning way;--said soft things also to\r\nthe countess, who received them very graciously; took Clara home to\r\nCastle Richmond for that night, somewhat to the surprise and much to\r\nthe gratification of Herbert, who found her sitting slily with the\r\nother girls when he came in before dinner; and arranged for her to\r\nmake a longer visit after the interval of a week or two. Herbert,\r\ntherefore, was on thoroughly good terms with his mother, and did\r\nenjoy some of the delights which he had promised himself.\r\n\r\nWith his sisters, also, and especially with Emmeline, he was once\r\nmore in a good humour. To her he made ample apology for his former\r\ncrossness, and received ample absolution. "I was so harassed," he\r\nsaid, "by my father\'s manner that I hardly knew what I was doing.\r\nAnd even now, when I think of his evident dislike to the marriage,\r\nit nearly drives me wild." The truth of all which Emmeline sadly\r\nacknowledged. How could any of them talk of their father except in a\r\nstrain of sadness?\r\n\r\nAll these things did not happen in the drawing-room at Castle\r\nRichmond without also being discussed in the kitchen. It was soon\r\nknown over the house that Master Herbert was to marry Lady Clara,\r\nand, indeed, there was no great pretence of keeping it secret.\r\nThe girls told the duchess, as they called Mrs. Jones--of course\r\nin confidence--but Mrs. Jones knew what such confidence meant,\r\nespecially as the matter was more than once distinctly alluded\r\nto by her ladyship; and thus the story was told, in confidence,\r\nto everybody in the establishment, and then repeated by them, in\r\nconfidence also, to nearly everybody out of it.\r\n\r\nIll news, they say, flies fast; and this news, which, going in that\r\ndirection, became ill, soon flew to Hap House.\r\n\r\n"So young Fitzgerald and the divine Clara are to hit it off, are\r\nthey?" said Captain Donnellan, who had driven over from Buttevant\r\nbarracks to breakfast at Hap House on a hunting-morning.\r\n\r\nThere were other men present, more intimate friends of Owen than this\r\ncaptain, who had known of Owen\'s misfortune in that quarter; and a\r\nsign was made to Donnellan to bid him drop the subject; but it was\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\n"Who? my cousin Herbert," said Owen, sharply. "Have you heard of\r\nthis, Barry?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Barry, "those sort of things are always being said,\r\nyou know. I did hear something of it somewhere. But I can\'t say I\r\nthought much about it." And then the subject was dropped during that\r\nmorning\'s breakfast. They all went to the hunt, and in the course of\r\nthe day Owen contrived to learn that the report was well founded.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as the countess and her daughter were sitting together\r\nover the fire, the gray-headed old butler brought in a letter upon an\r\nold silver salver, saying, "For Lady Clara, if you please, my lady."\r\n\r\nThe countess not unnaturally thought that the despatch had come from\r\nCastle Richmond, and smiled graciously as Clara put out her hand for\r\nthe missive. Lady Desmond again let her eyes drop upon the book which\r\nshe was reading, as though to show that she was by far too confiding\r\na mamma to interfere in any correspondence between her daughter\r\nand her daughter\'s lover. At the moment Lady Clara had been doing\r\nnothing. Her work was, indeed, on her lap, and her workbox was at\r\nher elbow; but her thoughts had been far away; far away as regards\r\nidea, though not so as to absolute locality; for in her mind she was\r\nwalking beneath those elm-trees, and a man was near her, with a horse\r\nfollowing at his heels.\r\n\r\n"The messenger is to wait for an answer, my lady," said the old\r\nbutler, with a second nod, which on this occasion was addressed to\r\nClara; and then the man withdrew.\r\n\r\nLady Clara blushed ruby red up to the roots of her hair when her\r\neyes fell on the address of the letter, for she knew it to be in the\r\nhandwriting of Owen Fitzgerald. Perhaps the countess from the corner\r\nof her eye may have observed some portion of her daughter\'s blushes;\r\nbut if so, she said nothing, attributing them to Clara\'s natural\r\nbashfulness in her present position. "She will get over it soon," the\r\ncountess may probably have said to herself.\r\n\r\nClara was indecisive, disturbed in her mind, and wretched. Owen\r\nhad sent her other letters; but they had been brought to her\r\nsurreptitiously, had been tendered to her in secret, and had always\r\nbeen returned by her unopened. She had not told her mother of these;\r\nat least, not purposely or at the moment: but she had been at\r\nno trouble to conceal the facts; and when the countess had once\r\nasked, she freely told her what had happened with an absence of any\r\nconfusion which had quite put Lady Desmond at her ease. But this\r\nletter was brought to her in the most open manner, and an answer to\r\nit openly demanded.\r\n\r\nShe turned it round slowly in her hand, and then looking up, said,\r\n"Mamma, this is from Owen Fitzgerald; what had I better do with it?"\r\n\r\n"From Owen Fitzgerald! Are you sure?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma." And then the countess had also to consider what steps\r\nunder such circumstances had better be taken. In the mean time Clara\r\nheld out her hand, tendering the letter to her mother.\r\n\r\n"You had better open it, my dear, and read it. No doubt it must be\r\nanswered." Lady Desmond felt that now there could be no danger from\r\nOwen Fitzgerald. Indeed she thought that there was not a remembrance\r\nof him left in her daughter\'s bosom; that the old love, such\r\nbaby-love as there had been, had vanished, quite swept out of that\r\nlittle heart by this new love of a brighter sort. But then Lady\r\nDesmond knew nothing of her daughter.\r\n\r\nSo instructed, Clara broke the seal, and read the letter, which ran\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Hap House, February, 184--.\r\n\r\n   My promised Love,\r\n\r\n   For let what will happen, such you are; I have this\r\n   morning heard tidings which, if true, will go far to drive\r\n   me to despair. But I will not believe them from any lips\r\n   save your own. I have heard that you are engaged to marry\r\n   Herbert Fitzgerald. At once, however, I declare that I do\r\n   not believe the statement. I have known you too well to\r\n   think that you can be false.\r\n\r\n   But, at any rate, I beg the favour of an interview\r\n   with you. After what has passed I think that under any\r\n   circumstances I have a right to demand it. I have pledged\r\n   myself to you; and as that pledge has been accepted, I am\r\n   entitled to some consideration.\r\n\r\n   I write this letter to you openly, being quite willing\r\n   that you should show it to your mother if you think fit.\r\n   My messenger will wait, and I do implore you to send me an\r\n   answer. And remember, Lady Clara, that, having accepted\r\n   my love, you cannot whistle me down the wind as though I\r\n   were of no account. After what has passed between us, you\r\n   cannot surely refuse to see me once more.\r\n\r\n   Ever your own--if you will have it so,\r\n\r\n   OWEN FITZGERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe read the letter very slowly, ever and anon looking up at her\r\nmother\'s face, and seeing that her mother was--not reading her book,\r\nbut pretending to read it. When she had finished it, she held it for\r\na moment, and then said, "Mamma, will you not look at it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly, my dear, if you wish me to do so." And she took the\r\nletter from her daughter\'s hand, and read it.\r\n\r\n"Just what one would expect from him, my dear; eager, impetuous, and\r\nthoughtless. One should not blame him much, for he does not mean to\r\ndo harm. But if he had any sense, he would know that he was taking\r\ntrouble for nothing."\r\n\r\n"And what shall I do, mamma?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I really think that I should answer him." It was delightful to\r\nsee the perfect confidence which the mother had in her daughter. "And\r\nI think I should see him, if he will insist upon it. It is foolish in\r\nhim to persist in remembering two words which you spoke to him as a\r\nchild; but perhaps it will be well that you should tell him yourself\r\nthat you were a child when you spoke those two words."\r\n\r\nAnd then Clara sent off the following reply, written under her\r\nmother\'s dictation; though the countess strove very hard to convince\r\nher daughter that she was wording it out of her own head:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Lady Clara Desmond presents her compliments to Mr. Owen\r\n   Fitzgerald, and will see Mr. Owen Fitzgerald at Desmond\r\n   Court at two o\'clock to-morrow, if Mr. Owen Fitzgerald\r\n   persists in demanding such an interview. Lady Clara\r\n   Desmond, however, wishes to express her opinion that it\r\n   would be better avoided.\r\n\r\n   Desmond Court,\r\n   Thursday evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe countess thought that this note was very cold and formal, and\r\nwould be altogether conclusive; but, nevertheless, at about eleven\r\no\'clock that night there came another messenger from Hap House with\r\nanother letter, saying that Owen would be at Desmond Court at two\r\no\'clock on the following day.\r\n\r\n"He is very foolish; that is all I can say," said the countess.\r\n\r\nAll that night and all the next morning poor Clara was very wretched.\r\nThat she had been right to give up a suitor who lived such a life as\r\nOwen Fitzgerald lived she could not doubt. But, nevertheless, was she\r\ntrue in giving him up? Had she made any stipulation as to his life\r\nwhen she accepted his love? If he called her false, as doubtless he\r\nwould call her, how would she defend herself? Had she any defence\r\nto offer? It was not only that she had rejected him, a poor lover;\r\nbut she had accepted a rich lover! What could she say to him when he\r\nupbraided her for such sordid conduct?\r\n\r\nAnd then as to her whistling him down the wind. Did she wish to do\r\nthat? In what state did her heart stand towards him? Might it not\r\nbe that, let her be ever so much on her guard, she would show him\r\nsome tenderness,--tenderness which would be treason to her present\r\naffianced suitor? Oh, why had her mother desired her to go through\r\nsuch an interview as this!\r\n\r\nWhen two o\'clock came Clara was in the drawing-room. She had said\r\nnothing to her mother as to the manner in which this meeting should\r\ntake place. But then at first she had had an idea that Lady Desmond\r\nwould be present. But as the time came near Clara was still alone.\r\nWhen her watch told her that it was already two, she was still by\r\nherself; and when the old servant, opening the door, announced that\r\nMr. Fitzgerald was there, she was still unsupported by the presence\r\nof any companion. It was very surprising that on such an occasion her\r\nmother should have kept herself away.\r\n\r\nShe had not seen Owen Fitzgerald since that day when they had walked\r\ntogether under the elm-trees, and it can hardly be said that she saw\r\nhim now. She had a feeling that she had injured him--had deceived,\r\nand in a manner betrayed him; and that feeling became so powerful\r\nwith her that she hardly dared to look him in the face.\r\n\r\nHe, when he entered the room, walked straight up to her, and offered\r\nher his hand. He, too, looked round the room to see whether Lady\r\nDesmond was there, and not finding her, was surprised. He had hardly\r\nhoped that such an opportunity would be allowed to him for declaring\r\nthe strength of his passion.\r\n\r\nShe got up, and taking his hand, muttered something; it certainly did\r\nnot matter what, for it was inaudible; but such as the words were,\r\nthey were the first spoken between them.\r\n\r\n"Lady Clara," he began; and then stopped himself; and, considering,\r\nrecommenced--"Clara, a report has reached my ears which I will\r\nbelieve from no lips but your own."\r\n\r\nShe now sat down on a sofa, and pointed to a chair for him, but he\r\nremained standing, and did so during the whole interview; or rather,\r\nwalking; for when he became energetic and impetuous, he moved about\r\nfrom place to place in the room, as though incapable of fixing\r\nhimself in one position.\r\n\r\nClara was ignorant whether or no it behoved her to rebuke him for\r\ncalling her simply by her Christian name. She thought that she ought\r\nto do so, but she did not do it.\r\n\r\n"I have been told," he continued, "that you have engaged yourself to\r\nmarry Herbert Fitzgerald; and I have now come to hear a contradiction\r\nof this from yourself."\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Fitzgerald, it is true."\r\n\r\n"It is true that Herbert Fitzgerald is your accepted lover?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said, looking down upon the ground, and blushing deeply as\r\nshe said it.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of a few moments, during which she felt that the\r\nfull fire of his glance was fixed upon her, and then he spoke.\r\n\r\n"You may well be ashamed to confess it," he said; "you may well feel\r\nthat you dare not look me in the face as you pronounce the words. I\r\nwould have believed it, Clara, from no other mouth than your own."\r\n\r\nIt appeared to Clara herself now as though she were greatly a\r\nculprit. She had not a word to say in her own defence. All those\r\narguments as to Owen\'s ill course of life were forgotten; and she\r\ncould only remember that she had acknowledged that she loved him, and\r\nthat she was now acknowledging that she loved another.\r\n\r\nBut now Owen had made his accusation; and as it was not answered, he\r\nhardly knew how to proceed. He walked about the room, endeavouring to\r\nthink what he had better say next.\r\n\r\n"I know this, Clara; it is your mother\'s doing, and not your own. You\r\ncould not bring yourself to be false, unless by her instigation."\r\n\r\n"No," said she; "you are wrong there. It is not my mother\'s doing:\r\nwhat I have done, I have done myself."\r\n\r\n"Is it not true," he asked, "that your word was pledged to me? Had\r\nyou not promised me that you would be my wife?"\r\n\r\n"I was very young," she said, falling back upon the only excuse which\r\noccurred to her at the moment as being possible to be used without\r\nincriminating him.\r\n\r\n"Young! Is not that your mother\'s teaching? Why, those were her very\r\nwords when she came to me at my house. I did not know that youth was\r\nany excuse for falsehood."\r\n\r\n"But it may be an excuse for folly," said Clara.\r\n\r\n"Folly! what folly? The folly of loving a poor suitor; the folly of\r\nbeing willing to marry a man who has not a large estate! Clara, I did\r\nnot think that you could have learned so much in so short a time."\r\n\r\nAll this was very hard upon her. She felt that it was hard, for she\r\nknew that he had done that which entitled her to regard her pledge to\r\nhim as at an end; but the circumstances were such that she could not\r\nexcuse herself.\r\n\r\n"Am I to understand," said Owen Fitzgerald, "that all that has passed\r\nbetween us is to go for nothing? that such promises as we have made\r\nto each other are to be of no account? To me they are sacred pledges,\r\nfrom which I would not escape even if I could."\r\n\r\nAs he then paused for a reply, she was obliged to say something.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have not come here to upbraid me, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Clara," he continued, "I have passed the last year with perfect\r\nreliance upon your faith. I need hardly tell you that it has not been\r\npassed happily, for it has been passed without seeing you. But though\r\nyou have been absent from me, I have never doubted you. I have known\r\nthat it was necessary that we should wait--wait perhaps till years\r\nshould make you mistress of your own actions: but nevertheless I was\r\nnot unhappy, for I was sure of your love."\r\n\r\nNow it was undoubtedly the case that Fitzgerald was treating her\r\nunfairly; and though she had not her wits enough about her to\r\nascertain this by process of argument, nevertheless the idea did come\r\nhome to her. It was true that she had promised her love to this man,\r\nas far as such promise could be conveyed by one word of assent; but\r\nit was true also that she had been almost a child when she pronounced\r\nthat word, and that things which had since occurred had entitled her\r\nto annul any amount of contract to which she might have been supposed\r\nto bind herself by that one word. She bethought herself, therefore,\r\nthat as she was so hard pressed she was forced to defend herself.\r\n\r\n"I was very young then, Mr. Fitzgerald, and hardly knew what I was\r\nsaying: afterwards, when mamma spoke to me, I felt that I was bound\r\nto obey her."\r\n\r\n"What, to obey her by forgetting me?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have never forgotten you, and never shall. I remember too well\r\nyour kindness to my brother; your kindness to us all."\r\n\r\n"Psha! you know I do not speak of that. Are you bound to obey your\r\nmother by forgetting that you have loved me?"\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment before she answered him, looking now full before\r\nher,--hardly yet bold enough to look him in the face.\r\n\r\n"No," she said; "I have not forgotten that I loved you. I shall never\r\nforget it. Child as I was, it shall never be forgotten. But I cannot\r\nlove you now--not in the manner you would have me."\r\n\r\n"And why not, Lady Clara? Why is love to cease on your part--to be\r\nthrown aside so easily by you, while with me it remains so stern a\r\nfact, and so deep a necessity? Is that just? When the bargain has\r\nonce been made, should it not be equally binding on us both?"\r\n\r\n"I do not think you are fair to me, Mr. Fitzgerald," she said; and\r\nsome spirit was now rising in her bosom.\r\n\r\n"Not fair to you? Do you say that I am unfair to you? Speak but one\r\nword to say that the troth which you pledged me a year since shall\r\nstill remain unbroken, and I will at once leave you till you yourself\r\nshall name the time when my suit may be renewed."\r\n\r\n"You know that I cannot do that."\r\n\r\n"And why not? I know that you ought to do it."\r\n\r\n"No, Mr. Fitzgerald, I ought not. I am now engaged to your cousin,\r\nwith the consent of mamma and of his friends. I can say nothing to\r\nyou now which I cannot repeat to him; nor can I say anything which\r\nshall oppose his wishes."\r\n\r\n"He is then so much more to you now than I am?"\r\n\r\n"He is everything to me now."\r\n\r\n"That is all the reply I am to get then! You acknowledge your\r\nfalseness, and throw me off without vouchsafing me any answer beyond\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"What would you have me say? I did do that which was wrong and\r\nfoolish, when--when we were walking there on the avenue. I did give a\r\npromise which I cannot now keep. It was all so hurried that I hardly\r\nremember what I said. But of this I am sure, that if I have caused\r\nyou unhappiness, I am very sorry to have done so. I cannot alter it\r\nall now; I cannot unsay what I said then; nor can I offer you that\r\nwhich I have now absolutely given to another."\r\n\r\nAnd then, as she finished speaking, she did pluck up courage to look\r\nhim in the face. She was now standing as well as he; but she was so\r\nstanding that the table, which was placed near the sofa, was still\r\nbetween him and her. As she finished speaking the door opened, and\r\nthe Countess of Desmond walked slowly into the room.\r\n\r\nOwen Fitzgerald, when he saw her, bowed low before her, and then\r\nfrankly offered her his hand. There was something in his manner to\r\nladies devoid of all bashfulness, and yet never too bold. He seemed\r\nto be aware that in speaking to any lady, be she who she might, he\r\nwas only exercising his undoubted privilege as a man. He never hummed\r\nand hawed and shook in his shoes as though the majesty of womanhood\r\nwere too great for his encounter. There are such men, and many of\r\nthem, who carry this dread to the last day of their long lives. I\r\nhave often wondered what women think of men who regard women as too\r\nawful for the free exercise of open speech.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, accepting the hand which he offered to\r\nher, but resuming her own very quickly, and then standing before him\r\nin all the dignity which she was able to assume, "I quite concurred\r\nwith my daughter that it was right that she should see you, as you\r\ninsisted on such an interview; but you must excuse me if I interrupt\r\nit. I must protect her from the embarrassment which your--your\r\nvehemence may occasion her."\r\n\r\n"Lady Desmond," he replied, "you are quite at liberty, as far as I\r\nam concerned, to hear all that passes between us. Your daughter is\r\nbetrothed to me, and I have come to claim from her the fulfilment of\r\nher promise."\r\n\r\n"For shame, Mr. Fitzgerald, for shame! When she was a child you\r\nextracted from her one word of folly; and now you would take\r\nadvantage of that foolish word; now, when you know that she is\r\nengaged to a man she loves with the full consent of all her friends.\r\nI thought I knew you well enough to feel sure that you were not so\r\nungenerous."\r\n\r\n"Ungenerous! no; I have not that generosity which would enable me to\r\ngive up my very heart\'s blood, the only joy of my soul, to such a one\r\nas my cousin Herbert."\r\n\r\n"You have nothing to give up, Mr. Fitzgerald: you must have known\r\nfrom the very first that my daughter could not marry you--"\r\n\r\n"Not marry me! And why not, Lady Desmond? Is not my blood as good\r\nas his?--unless, indeed, you are prepared to sell your child to the\r\nhighest bidder!"\r\n\r\n"Clara, my dear, I think you had better leave the room," said the\r\ncountess; "no doubt you have assured Mr. Fitzgerald that you are\r\nengaged to his cousin Herbert."\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma."\r\n\r\n"Then he can have no further claim on your attendance, and his\r\nvehemence will terrify you."\r\n\r\n"Vehement! how can I help being vehement when, like a ruined gambler,\r\nI am throwing my last chance for such a stake?"\r\n\r\nAnd then he intercepted Clara as she stepped towards the drawing-room\r\ndoor. She stopped in her course, and stood still, looking down upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald," said the countess, "I will thank you to let Lady\r\nClara leave the room. She has given you the answer for which you have\r\nasked, and it would not be right in me to permit her to be subjected\r\nto further embarrassment."\r\n\r\n"I will only ask her to listen to one word. Clara--"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald, you have no right to address my daughter with that\r\nfreedom," said the countess; but Owen hardly seemed to hear her.\r\n\r\n"I here, in your hearing, protest against your marriage with Herbert\r\nFitzgerald. I claim your love as my own. I bid you think of the\r\npromise which you gave me; and I tell you that as I loved you then\r\nwith all my heart, so do I love you at this moment; so shall I love\r\nyou always. Now I will not hinder you any longer."\r\n\r\nAnd then he opened the door for her, and she passed on, bowing to\r\nhim, and muttering some word of farewell that was inaudible.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment with the door in his hand, meditating whether\r\nhe might not say good morning to the countess without returning into\r\nthe room; but as he so stood she called him. "Mr. Fitzgerald," she\r\nsaid; and so he therefore came back, and once more closed the door.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw that the countenance of Lady Desmond was much\r\nchanged. Hitherto she had been every inch the countess, stern and\r\ncold and haughty; but now she looked at him as she used to look in\r\nthose old winter evenings when they were accustomed to talk together\r\nover the evening fire in close friendliness, while she, Lady Desmond,\r\nwould speak to him in the intimacy of her heart of her children,\r\nPatrick and Clara.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald," she said, and the tone of her voice also was\r\nchanged. "You are hardly fair to us; are you?"\r\n\r\n"Not fair, Lady Desmond?"\r\n\r\n"No, not fair. Sit down now, and listen to me for a moment. If you\r\nhad a child, a penniless girl like Clara, would you be glad to see\r\nher married to such a one as you are yourself?"\r\n\r\n"In what way do you mean? Speak out, Lady Desmond."\r\n\r\n"No; I will not speak out, for I would not hurt you. I myself am too\r\nfond of you--as an old friend, to wish to do so. That you may marry\r\nand live happily, live near us here, so that we may know you, I most\r\nheartily desire. But you cannot marry that child."\r\n\r\n"And why not, if she loves me?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, not even if she did. Wealth and position are necessary to\r\nthe station in which she has been born. She is an earl\'s daughter,\r\npenniless as she is. I will have no secrets from you. As a mother, I\r\ncould not give her to one whose career is such as yours. As the widow\r\nof an earl, I could not give her to one whose means of maintaining\r\nher are so small. If you will think of this, you will hardly be angry\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"Love is nothing then?"\r\n\r\n"Is all to be sacrificed to your love? Think of it, Mr. Fitzgerald,\r\nand let me have the happiness of knowing that you consent to this\r\nmatch."\r\n\r\n"Never!" said he. "Never!" And so he left the room, without wishing\r\nher further farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nDIPLOMACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the last conversation that has been related as\r\nhaving taken place at the Kanturk Hotel, Mr. Mollett junior was\r\non his way to Castle Richmond. He had on that occasion stated his\r\nintention of making such a journey with the view of "freshening the\r\nold gentleman up a bit;" and although his father did all in his power\r\nto prevent the journey, going so far on one occasion as to swear that\r\nif it was made he would throw over the game altogether, nevertheless\r\nAby persevered.\r\n\r\n"You may leave the boards whenever you like, governor," said Aby. "I\r\nknow quite enough of the part to carry on the play."\r\n\r\n"You think you do," said the father in his anger; "but you\'ll find\r\nyourself in the dark yet before you\'ve done."\r\n\r\nAnd then again he expostulated in a different tone. "You\'ll ruin it\r\nall, Aby; you will indeed; you don\'t know all the circumstances;\r\nindeed you don\'t."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I?" said Aby. "Then I\'ll not be long learning them."\r\n\r\nThe father did what he could; but he had no means of keeping his son\r\nat home, and so Aby went. Aby doubtless entertained an idea that his\r\nfather was deficient in pluck for the management of so difficult\r\na matter, and that he could supply what his father wanted. So he\r\ndressed himself in his best, and having hired a gig and a man who he\r\nflattered himself would look like a private servant, he started from\r\nCork, and drove himself to Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\nHe had on different occasions been down in the neighbourhood,\r\nprowling about like a thief in the night, picking up information\r\nas he called it, and seeing how the land lay; but he had never yet\r\npresented himself to any one within the precincts of the Castle\r\nRichmond demesne. His present intention was to drive up to the front\r\ndoor, and ask at once for Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, sending in his card\r\nif need be, on which were printed the words:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   MR. ABRAHAM MOLLETT, Junior.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the additional words, "Piccadilly, London," written in the\r\nleft-hand lower corner.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take the bull by the horns," said he to himself. "It\'s better\r\nto make the spoon at once, even if we do run some small chance of\r\nspoiling the horn." And that he might be well enabled to carry out\r\nhis purpose with reference to this bull, he lifted his flask to\r\nhis mouth as soon as he had passed through the great demesne gate,\r\nand took a long pull at it. "There\'s nothing like a little jumping\r\npowder," he said, speaking to himself again, and then he drove boldly\r\nup the avenue.\r\n\r\nHe had not yet come in sight of the house when he met two gentlemen\r\nwalking on the road. They, as he approached, stood a little on one\r\nside, not only so as to allow him to pass, but to watch him as he did\r\nso. They were Mr. Somers and Herbert Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"It is the younger of those two men. I\'m nearly certain of it,"\r\nsaid Somers as the gig approached. "I saw him as he walked by me in\r\nKanturk Street, and I don\'t think I can mistake the horrid impudence\r\nof his face. I beg your pardon, sir,"--and now he addressed Mollett\r\nin the gig--"but are you going up to the house?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; that\'s my notion just at present. Any commands that way?"\r\n\r\n"This is Mr. Fitzgerald--Mr. Herbert Fitzgerald; and I am Mr. Somers,\r\nthe agent. Can we do anything for you?"\r\n\r\nAby Mollett raised his hat, and the two gentlemen touched theirs.\r\n"Thank\'ee, sir," said Aby; "but I believe my business must be with\r\nthe worthy baro-nett himself; more particularly as I \'appen to know\r\nthat he\'s at home."\r\n\r\n"My father is not very well," said Herbert, "and I do not think that\r\nhe will be able to see you."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take the liberty of hasking and of sending in my card," said\r\nAby; and he gave his horse a flick as intending thus to cut short the\r\nconversation. But Mr. Somers had put his hand upon the bridle, and\r\nthe beast was contented to stand still.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll have the kindness to wait a moment," said Mr. Somers; and\r\nhe put on a look of severity, which he well knew how to assume, and\r\nwhich somewhat cowed poor Aby. "You have been down here before, I\r\nthink," continued Mr. Somers.\r\n\r\n"What, at Castle Richmond? No, I haven\'t. And if I had, what\'s that\r\nto you if Sir Thomas chooses to see me? I hain\'t hintruding, I\r\nsuppose."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been down at Kanturk before--once or twice; for I have seen\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"And supposing I\'ve been there ten or twelve times,--what is there in\r\nthat?" said Aby.\r\n\r\nMr. Somers still held the horse\'s head, and stood a moment\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll thank you to let go my \'oss," said Aby raising his whip and\r\nshaking the reins.\r\n\r\n"What do you say your name is?" asked Mr. Somers.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say my name was anything yet. I hain\'t ashamed of it,\r\nhowever, nor hasn\'t hany cause to be. That\'s my name, and if you\'ll\r\nsend my card in to Sir Thomas, with my compliments, and say that\r\nhi\'ve three words to say to him very particular; why hi\'ll be obliged\r\nto you." And then Mr. Mollett handed Mr. Somers his card.\r\n\r\n"Mollett!" said Mr. Somers very unceremoniously. "Mollett, Mollett.\r\nDo you know the name, Herbert?"\r\n\r\nHerbert said that he did not.\r\n\r\n"It\'s about business I suppose?" asked Mr. Somers.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Aby; "private business; very particular."\r\n\r\n"The same that brought your father here;" and Mr. Somers again looked\r\ninto his face with a close scrutiny.\r\n\r\nAby was abashed, and for a moment or two he did not answer. "Well,\r\nthen; it is the same business," he said at last. "And I\'ll thank you\r\nto let me go on. I\'m not used to be stopped in this way."\r\n\r\n"You can follow us up to the house," said Mr. Somers to him. "Come\r\nhere, Herbert." And then they walked along the road in such a way\r\nthat Aby was forced to allow his horse to walk after them.\r\n\r\n"These are the men who are doing it," said Mr. Somers in a whisper to\r\nhis companion. "Whatever is in the wind, whatever may be the cause of\r\nyour father\'s trouble, they are concerned in it. They are probably\r\ngetting money from him in some way."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?"\r\n\r\n"I do. We must not force ourselves upon your father\'s confidence, but\r\nwe must endeavour to save him from this misery. Do you go in to him\r\nwith this card. Do not show it to him too suddenly; and then find out\r\nwhether he really wishes to see the man. I will stay about the place;\r\nfor it may be possible that a magistrate will be wanted, and in such\r\na matter you had better not act."\r\n\r\nThey were now at the hall-door, and Somers, turning to Mollett, told\r\nhim that Mr. Herbert Fitzgerald would carry the card to his father.\r\nAnd then he added, seeing that Mollett was going to come down, "You\r\nhad better stay in the gig till Mr. Fitzgerald comes back; just sit\r\nwhere you are; you\'ll get an answer all in good time."\r\n\r\nSir Thomas was crouching over the fire in his study when his son\r\nentered, with his eyes fixed upon a letter which he held in his hand,\r\nand which, when he saw Herbert, he closed up and put away.\r\n\r\n"Father," said Herbert, in a cheerful every-day voice, as though he\r\nhad nothing special to communicate, "there is a man in a gig out\r\nthere. He says he wants to see you."\r\n\r\n"A man in a gig!" and Herbert could see that his father had already\r\nbegun to tremble. But every sound made him tremble now.\r\n\r\n"Yes; a man in a gig. What is it he says his name is? I have his card\r\nhere. A young man."\r\n\r\n"Oh, a young man?" said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Yes, here it is. Abraham Mollett. I can\'t say that your friend seems\r\nto be very respectable, in spite of his gig," and Herbert handed the\r\ncard to his father.\r\n\r\nThe son purposely looked away as he mentioned the name, as his great\r\nanxiety was not to occasion distress. But he felt that the sound of\r\nthe word had been terrible in his father\'s ears. Sir Thomas had risen\r\nfrom his chair; but he now sat down again, or rather fell into it.\r\nBut nevertheless he took the card, and said that he would see the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n"A young man do you say, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, father, a young man. And, father, if you are not well, tell me\r\nwhat the business is and let me see him."\r\n\r\nBut Sir Thomas persisted, shaking his head, and saying that he would\r\nsee the man himself.\r\n\r\n"Somers is out there. Will you let him do it?"\r\n\r\n"No. I wonder, Herbert, that you can tease me so. Let the man be sent\r\nin here. But, oh, Herbert--Herbert--!"\r\n\r\nThe young man rushed round and kneeled at his father\'s knee. "What is\r\nit, father? Why will you not tell me? I know you have some grief, and\r\ncannot you trust me? Do you not know that you can trust me?"\r\n\r\n"My poor boy, my poor boy!"\r\n\r\n"What is it, father? If this man here is concerned in it, let me see\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"No, no, no."\r\n\r\n"Or at any rate let me be with you when he is here. Let me share your\r\ntrouble if I can do nothing to cure it."\r\n\r\n"Herbert, my darling, leave me and send him in. If it be necessary\r\nthat you should bear this calamity, it will come upon you soon\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"But I am afraid of this man--for your sake, father."\r\n\r\n"He will do me no harm; let him come to me. But, Herbert, say nothing\r\nto Somers about this. Somers has not seen the man; has he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; we both spoke to him together as he drove up the avenue."\r\n\r\n"And what did he say? Did he say anything?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but that he wanted to see you, and then he gave his card to\r\nMr. Somers. Mr. Somers wished to save you from the annoyance."\r\n\r\n"Why should it annoy me to see any man? Let Mr. Somers mind his\r\nown business. Surely I can have business of my own without his\r\ninterference." With this Herbert left his father, and returned to the\r\nhall-door to usher in Mr. Mollett junior.\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Mr. Somers, who was standing by the hall fire, and who\r\njoined Herbert at the front door.\r\n\r\n"My father will see the man."\r\n\r\n"And have you learned who he is?"\r\n\r\n"I have learned nothing but this--that Sir Thomas does not wish that\r\nwe should inquire. Now, Mr. Mollett, Sir Thomas will see you; so you\r\ncan come down. Make haste now, and remember that you are not to stay\r\nlong, for my father is ill." And then leading Aby through the hall\r\nand along a passage, he introduced him into Sir Thomas\'s room.\r\n\r\n"And Herbert--" said the father; whereupon Herbert again turned\r\nround. His father was endeavouring to stand, but supporting himself\r\nby the back of his chair. "Do not disturb me for half an hour; but\r\ncome to me then, and knock at the door. This gentleman will have done\r\nby that time."\r\n\r\n"If we do not put a stop to this, your father will be in a mad-house\r\nor on his death-bed before long." So spoke Mr. Somers in a low,\r\nsolemn whisper when Herbert again joined him at the hall-door.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, sir; sit down," said Sir Thomas, endeavouring to be civil\r\nand to seem at his ease at the same time. Aby was himself so much\r\nbewildered for the moment, that he hardly perceived the embarrassment\r\nunder which the baronet was labouring.\r\n\r\nAby sat down, in the way usual to such men in such places, on the\r\ncorner of his chair, and put his hat on the ground between his feet.\r\nThen he took out his handkerchief and blew his nose, and after that\r\nhe expressed an opinion that he was in the presence of Sir Thomas\r\nFitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"And you are Mr. Abraham Mollett," said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir Thomas, that\'s my name. I believe, Sir Thomas, that you\r\nhave the pleasure of some slight acquaintance with my father, Mr.\r\nMatthew Mollett?"\r\n\r\nWhat a pleasure under such circumstances! Sir Thomas, however, nodded\r\nhis head, and Aby went on.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, Sir Thomas, business is business; and my father, \'e ain\'t\r\na good man of business. A gen\'leman like you, Sir Thomas, has seen\r\nthat with \'alf an eye, I know." And then he waited a moment for an\r\nanswer; but as he got none he proceeded.\r\n\r\n"My governor\'s one of the best of fellows going, but \'e ain\'t sharp\r\nand decisive. Sharp\'s the word now a days, Sir Thomas; ain\'t it?" and\r\nhe spoke this in a manner so suited to the doctrine which he intended\r\nto inculcate, that the poor old gentleman almost jumped up in his\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nAnd Aby, seeing this, seated himself more comfortably in his own. The\r\nawe which the gilt bindings of the books and the thorough comfort of\r\nthe room had at first inspired was already beginning to fade away. He\r\nhad come there to bully, and though his courage had failed him for a\r\nmoment under the stern eye of Mr. Somers, it quickly returned to him\r\nnow that he was able to see how weak was his actual victim.\r\n\r\n"Sharp\'s the word, Sir Thomas; and my governor, \'e ain\'t sharp--not\r\nsharp as he ought to be in such a matter as this. This is what I\r\ncalls a real bit of cheese. Now it\'s no good going on piddling and\r\npeddling in such a case as this; is it now, Sir Thomas?"\r\n\r\nSir Thomas muttered something, but it was no more than a groan.\r\n\r\n"Not the least use," continued Aby. "Now the question, as I takes it,\r\nis this. There\'s your son there as fetched me in \'ere; a fine young\r\ngen\'leman \'e is, as ever I saw; I will say that. Well, now; who\'s to\r\nhave this \'ere property when you walk the plank--as walk it you must\r\nsome day, in course? Is it to be this son of yours, or is it to be\r\nthis other Fitzgerald of \'Appy \'Ouse? Now, if you ask me, I\'m all for\r\nyour son, though maybe he mayn\'t be all right as regards the dam."\r\n\r\nThere was certainly some truth in what Aby had said with reference to\r\nhis father. Mr. Mollett senior had never debated the matter in terms\r\nsharp and decisive as these were. Think who they were of whom this\r\nbrute was talking to that wretched gentleman; the wife of his bosom,\r\nthan whom no wife was ever more dearly prized; the son of his love,\r\nthe centre of all his hopes, the heir of his wealth--if that might\r\nstill be so. And yet he listened to such words as these, and did not\r\ncall in his servants to turn the speaker of them out of his doors.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no wish for that \'Appy \'Ouse man, Sir Thomas; not the least.\r\nAnd as for your good lady, she\'s nothing to me one way or the\r\nother--whatever she may be to my governor--" and here there fell\r\na spasm upon the poor man\'s heart, which nearly brought him from\r\nthe chair to the ground; but, nevertheless, he still contained\r\nhimself--"my governor\'s former lady, my own mother," continued Aby,\r\n"whom I never see\'d, she\'d gone to kingdom come, you know, before\r\nthat time, Sir Thomas. There hain\'t no doubt about that. So you\r\nsee--" and hereupon he dropped his voice from the tone which he had\r\nhitherto been using to an absolute whisper, and drawing his chair\r\nclose to that of the baronet, and putting his hands upon his knees,\r\nbrought his mouth close to his companion\'s ear--"So you see," he\r\nsaid, "when that youngster was born, Lady F. was Mrs. M.--wasn\'t she?\r\nand for the matter of that, Lady F. is Mrs. M. to this very hour.\r\nThat\'s the real chat; ain\'t it, Sir Thomas? My stepmother, you know.\r\nThe governor could take her away with him to-morrow if he chose,\r\naccording to the law of the land--couldn\'t he now?"\r\n\r\nThere was no piddling or peddling about this at any rate. Old Mollett\r\nin discussing the matter with his victim had done so by hints and\r\ninuendos, through long windings, by signs and the dropping of a few\r\ndark words. He had never once mentioned in full terms the name of\r\nLady Fitzgerald; had never absolutely stated that he did possess or\r\never had possessed a wife. It had been sufficient for him to imbue\r\nSir Thomas with the knowledge that his son Herbert was in great\r\ndanger as to his heritage. Doubtless the two had understood each\r\nother; but the absolute naked horror of the surmised facts had been\r\nkept delicately out of sight. But such delicacy was not to Aby\'s\r\ntaste. Sharp, short, and decisive; that was his motto. No "long\xe6\r\nambages" for him. The whip was in his hand, as he thought, and he\r\ncould best master the team by using it.\r\n\r\nAnd yet Sir Thomas lived and bore it. As he sat there half stupefied,\r\nnumbed as it were by the intensity of his grief, he wondered at his\r\nown power of endurance. "She is Mrs. M., you know; ain\'t she now?" He\r\ncould sit there and hear that, and yet live through it. So much he\r\ncould do, and did do; but as for speaking, that was beyond him.\r\n\r\nYoung Mollett thought that this "freshening up of the old gentleman"\r\nseemed to answer; so he continued. "Yes, Sir Thomas, your son\'s my\r\nfavourite, I tell you fairly. But then, you know, if I backs the\r\nfavourite, in course I likes to win upon him. How is it to be, now?"\r\nand then he paused for an answer, which, however, was not\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\n"You see you haven\'t been dealing quite on the square with the\r\ngovernor. You two is, has it were, in a boat together. We\'ll call\r\nthat boat the Lady F., or the Mrs. M., which ever you like;"--and\r\nthen Aby laughed, for the conceit pleased him--"but the hearnings of\r\nthat boat should be divided hequally. Ain\'t that about the ticket?\r\nheh, Sir Thomas? Come, don\'t be down on your luck. A little quiet\r\ntalkee-talkee between you and me\'ll soon put this small matter on a\r\nright footing."\r\n\r\n"What is it you want? tell me at once," at last groaned the poor man.\r\n\r\n"Well now, that\'s something like; and I\'ll tell you what we want.\r\nThere are only two of us you know, the governor and I; and very\r\nlonely we are, for it\'s a sad thing for a man to have the wife of his\r\nbosom taken from him."\r\n\r\nThen there was a groan which struck even Aby\'s ear; but Sir Thomas\r\nwas still alive and listening, and so he went on.\r\n\r\n"This property here, Sir Thomas, is a good twelve thousand a year. I\r\nknow hall about it as though I\'d been \'andling it myself for the last\r\nten years. And a great deal of cutting there is in twelve thousand\r\na year. You\'ve \'ad your whack out of it, and now we wants to have\r\nhourn. That\'s Henglish, hain\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Did your father send you here, Mr. Mollett?"\r\n\r\n"Never you mind who sent me, Sir Thomas. Perhaps he did, and perhaps\r\nhe didn\'t. Perhaps I came without hany sending. Perhaps I\'m more\r\nhup to this sort of work than he is. At any rate, I\'ve got the part\r\npretty well by \'eart--you see that, don\'t you? Well, hour hultimatum\r\nabout the business is this. Forty thousand pounds paid down on the\r\nnail, half to the governor, and half to your \'umble servant, before\r\nthe end of this year; a couple of thousand more in hand for the\r\nyear\'s hexpenses--and--and--a couple of hundred or so now at once\r\nbefore I leave you; for to tell the truth we\'re run huncommonly dry\r\njust at the present moment." And then Aby drew his breath and paused\r\nfor an answer.\r\n\r\nPoor Sir Thomas was now almost broken down. His head swam round and\r\nround, and he felt that he was in a whirlpool from which there was no\r\nescape. He had heard the sum named, and knew that he had no power of\r\nraising it. His interest in the estate was but for his life, and that\r\nlife was now all but run out. He had already begun to feel that his\r\nson must be sacrificed, but he had struggled and endured in order\r\nthat he might save his wife. But what could he do now? What further\r\nstruggle could he make? His present most eager desire was that that\r\nhorrid man should be removed from his hearing and his eyesight.\r\n\r\nBut Aby had not yet done: he had hitherto omitted to mention one not\r\ninconsiderable portion of the amicable arrangement which, according\r\nto him, would have the effect of once more placing the two families\r\ncomfortably on their feet. "There\'s one other pint, Sir Thomas," he\r\ncontinued, "and hif I can bring you and your good lady to my way of\r\nthinking on that, why, we may all be comfortable for all that is come\r\nand gone. You\'ve a daughter Hemmeline."\r\n\r\n"What!" said Sir Thomas, turning upon him; for there was still so\r\nmuch of life left in him that he could turn upon his foe when he\r\nheard his daughter\'s name thus polluted.\r\n\r\n"Has lovely a gal to my way of thinking as my heyes ever rested on;\r\nand I\'m not haccounted a bad judge of such cattle, I can tell you,\r\nSir Thomas."\r\n\r\n"That will do, that will do," said Sir Thomas, attempting to rise,\r\nbut still holding on by the back of his chair. "You can go now, sir;\r\nI cannot hear more from you."\r\n\r\n"Go!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; go."\r\n\r\n"I know a trick worth two of that, Sir Thomas. If you like to give\r\nme your daughter Hemmeline for my wife, whatever her fortin\'s to be,\r\nI\'ll take it as part of my half of the forty thousand pounds. There\r\nnow." And then Aby again waited for a reply.\r\n\r\nBut now there came a knock at the door, and following quick upon the\r\nknock Herbert entered the room. "Well, father," said the son.\r\n\r\n"Herbert!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, father;" and he went round and supported his father on his arm.\r\n\r\n"Herbert, will you tell that man to go?"\r\n\r\n"Come, sir, you have disturbed my father enough; will you have the\r\nkindness to leave him now?"\r\n\r\n"I may chance to disturb him more, and you too, sir, if you treat me\r\nin that way. Let go my arm, sir. Am I to have any answer from you,\r\nSir Thomas?"\r\n\r\nBut Sir Thomas could make no further attempt at speaking. He was now\r\nonce more seated in his chair, holding his son\'s hand, and when he\r\nagain heard Mollett\'s voice he merely made a sign for him to go.\r\n\r\n"You see the state my father is in, Mr. Mollett," said Herbert; "I do\r\nnot know what is the nature of your business, but whatever it may be,\r\nyou must leave him now." And he made a slight attempt to push the\r\nvisitor towards the door.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better take care what you\'re doing, Mr. Fitzgerald," said\r\nMollett. "By ---- you had! If you anger me, I might say a word that\r\nI couldn\'t unsay again, which would put you into queer street, I can\r\ntell you."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t quarrel with him, my boy; pray don\'t quarrel with him, but let\r\nhim leave me," said Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mollett, you see my father\'s state; you must be aware that it is\r\nimperative that he should be left alone."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know nothing about that, young gen\'leman; business is\r\nbusiness, and I hain\'t got hany answer to my proposals. Sir Thomas,\r\ndo you say \'Yes\' to them proposals." But Sir Thomas was still dumb.\r\n"To all but the last? Come," continued Aby, "that was put in quite as\r\nmuch for your good as it was for mine." But not a word came from the\r\nbaronet.\r\n\r\n"Then I shan\'t stir," said Aby, again seating himself.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall have the servants in," said Herbert, "and a magistrate\r\nwho is in the hall;" and he put his hand towards the handle of the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n"Well, as the old gen\'leman\'s hill, I\'ll go now and come again. But\r\nlook you here, Sir Thomas, you have got my proposals, and if I don\'t\r\nget an answer to them in three days\' time,--why you\'ll hear from me\r\nin another way, that\'s all. And so will her ladyship." And with this\r\nthreat Mr. Abraham Mollett allowed himself to be conducted through\r\nthe passage into the hall, and from thence to his gig.\r\n\r\n"See that he drives away; see that he goes," said Herbert to Mr.\r\nSomers, who was still staying about the place.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll drive away fast enough," said Aby, as he stepped into the\r\ngig, "and come back fast enough too," he muttered to himself. In the\r\nmean time Herbert had run back to his father\'s room.\r\n\r\n"Has he gone?" murmured Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has gone. There; you can hear the wheels of his gig on the\r\ngravel."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my boy, my poor boy!"\r\n\r\n"What is it, father? Why do you not tell me? Why do you allow such\r\nmen as that to come and harass you, when a word would keep them from\r\nyou? Father, good cannot come of it."\r\n\r\n"No, Herbert, no; good will not come of it. There is no good to come\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"Then why will you not tell us?"\r\n\r\n"You will know it all soon enough. But Herbert, do not say a word to\r\nyour mother. Not a word as you value my love. Let us save her while\r\nwe can. You promise me that."\r\n\r\nHerbert gave him the required promise.\r\n\r\n"Look here," and he took up the letter which he had before crumpled\r\nin his hand. "Mr. Prendergast will be here next week. I shall tell\r\neverything to him."\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Sir Thomas went to his bed, and there by his bedside\r\nhis wife sat for the rest of the evening. But he said no word to her\r\nof his sorrow.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Prendergast is coming here," said Herbert to Mr. Somers.\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it, though I do not know him," said Mr. Somers. "For,\r\nmy dear boy, it is necessary that there should be some one here."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PATH BENEATH THE ELMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the last chapter but one Owen\r\nFitzgerald left Lady Desmond in the drawing-room at Desmond Court\r\nsomewhat abruptly, having absolutely refused to make peace with the\r\nDesmond faction by giving his consent to the marriage between Clara\r\nand his cousin Herbert. And it will perhaps be remembered also, that\r\nLady Desmond had asked for this consent in a manner that was almost\r\nhumble. She had shown herself most anxious to keep on friendly terms\r\nwith the rake of Hap House,--rake and rou\xe9, gambler and spendthrift,\r\nas he was reputed to be,--if only he would abandon his insane claim\r\nto the hand of Clara Desmond. But this feeling she had shown when\r\nthey two were alone together, after Clara had left them. As long\r\nas her daughter had been present, Lady Desmond had maintained her\r\ntone of indignation and defiance; but, when the door was closed and\r\nthey two were alone, she had become kind in her language and almost\r\ntender.\r\n\r\nMy readers will probably conceive that she had so acted, overcome by\r\nher affection for Owen Fitzgerald and with a fixed resolve to win him\r\nfor herself. Men and women when they are written about are always\r\nsupposed to have fixed resolves, though in life they are so seldom\r\nfound to be thus armed. To speak the truth, the countess had had no\r\nfixed resolve in the matter, either when she had thought about Owen\'s\r\ncoming, or when, subsequently, she had found herself alone with him\r\nin her drawing-room. That Clara should not marry him,--on so much\r\nshe had resolved long ago. But all danger on that head was, it may\r\nbe said, over. Clara, like a good child, had behaved in the best\r\npossible manner; had abandoned her first lover, a lover that was poor\r\nand unfitted for her, as soon as told to do so; and had found for\r\nherself a second lover, who was rich, and proper, and in every way\r\ndesirable. As regards Clara, the countess felt herself to be safe;\r\nand, to give her her due, she had been satisfied that the matter\r\nshould so rest. She had not sought any further interview with\r\nFitzgerald. He had come there against her advice, and she had gone to\r\nmeet him prompted by the necessity of supporting her daughter, and\r\nwithout any other views of her own.\r\n\r\nBut when she found herself alone with him; when she looked into his\r\nface, and saw how handsome, how noble, how good it was--good in its\r\ninherent manliness and bravery--she could not but long that this feud\r\nshould be over, and that she might be able once more to welcome him\r\nas her friend. If only he would give up this frantic passion, this\r\nfutile, wicked, senseless attempt to make them all wretched by an\r\ninsane marriage, would it not be sweet again to make some effort to\r\nrescue him from the evil ways into which he had fallen?\r\n\r\nBut Owen himself would make no response to this feeling. Clara\r\nDesmond was his love, and he would, of his own consent, yield her to\r\nno one. In truth, he was, in a certain degree, mad on this subject.\r\nHe did think that because the young girl had given him a promise--had\r\nsaid to him a word or two which he called a promise--she was now of\r\nright his bride; that there belonged to him an indefeasible property\r\nin her heart, in her loveliness, in the inexpressible tenderness of\r\nher young springing beauty, of which no subsequent renouncing on her\r\npart could fairly and honestly deprive him. That others should oppose\r\nthe match was intelligible to him; but it was hardly intelligible\r\nthat she should betray him. And, as yet, he did not believe that she\r\nherself was the mainspring of this renouncing. Others, the countess\r\nand the Castle Richmond people, had frightened her into falseness;\r\nand, therefore, it became him to maintain his right by any\r\nmeans--almost by any means, within his power. Give her up of his own\r\nfree will and voice! Say that Herbert Fitzgerald should take her with\r\nhis consent! that she should go as a bride to Castle Richmond, while\r\nhe stood by and smiled, and wished them joy! Never! And so he rode\r\naway with a stern heart, leaving her standing there with something of\r\nsternness about her heart also.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Clara, when she was sure that her rejected suitor\r\nwas well away from the place, put on her bonnet and walked out. It\r\nwas her wont at this time to do so; and she was becoming almost a\r\ncreature of habit, shut up as she was in that old dreary barrack. Her\r\nmother very rarely went with her; and she habitually performed the\r\nsame journey over the same ground, at the same hour, day after day.\r\nSo it had been, and so it was still,--unless Herbert Fitzgerald were\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion she saw no more of her mother before she left\r\nthe house. She passed the drawing-room door, and seeing that it was\r\najar, knew that the countess was there; but she had nothing to say to\r\nher mother as to the late interview, unless her mother had aught to\r\nsay to her. So she passed on. In truth her mother had nothing to say\r\nto her. She was sitting there alone, with her head resting on her\r\nhand, with that sternness at her heart and a cloud upon her brow, but\r\nshe was not thinking of her daughter. Had she not, with her skill\r\nand motherly care, provided well for Clara? Had she not saved her\r\ndaughter from all the perils which beset the path of a young girl?\r\nHad she not so brought her child up and put her forth into the world,\r\nthat, portionless as that child was, all the best things of the world\r\nhad been showered into her lap? Why should the countess think more\r\nof her daughter? It was of herself she was thinking; and of what her\r\nlife would be all alone, absolutely alone, in that huge frightful\r\nhome of hers, without a friend, almost without an acquaintance,\r\nwithout one soul near her whom she could love or who would love her.\r\nShe had put out her hand to Owen Fitzgerald, and he had rejected it.\r\nHer he had regarded merely as the mother of the woman he loved. And\r\nthen the Countess of Desmond began to ask herself if she were old and\r\nwrinkled and ugly, only fit to be a dowager in mind, body, and in\r\nname!\r\n\r\nOver the same ground! Yes, always over the same ground. Lady Clara\r\nnever varied her walk. It went from the front entrance of the court,\r\nwith one great curve, down to the old ruined lodge which opened on to\r\nthe road running from Kanturk to Cork. It was here that the row of\r\nelm trees stood, and it was here that she had once walked with a hot,\r\neager lover beside her, while a docile horse followed behind their\r\nfeet. It was here that she walked daily; and was it possible that she\r\nshould walk here without thinking of him?\r\n\r\nIt was always on the little well-worn path by the road-side, not on\r\nthe road itself, that she took her measured exercise; and now, as she\r\nwent along, she saw on the moist earth the fresh prints of a horse\'s\r\nhoofs. He also had ridden down the same way, choosing to pass over\r\nthe absolute spot in which those words had been uttered, thinking of\r\nthat moment, as she also was thinking of it. She felt sure that such\r\nhad been the case. She knew that it was this that had brought him\r\nthere--there on to the foot-traces which they had made together.\r\n\r\nAnd did he then love her so truly,--with a love so hot, so eager, so\r\ndeeply planted in his very soul? Was it really true that a passion\r\nfor her had so filled his heart, that his whole life must by that be\r\nmade or marred? Had she done this thing to him? Had she so impressed\r\nher image on his mind that he must be wretched without her? Was she\r\nso much to him, so completely all in all as regarded his future\r\nworldly happiness? Those words of his, asserting that love--her\r\nlove--was to him a stern fact, a deep necessity--recurred over and\r\nover again to her mind. Could it really be that in doing as she had\r\ndone, in giving herself to another after she had promised herself to\r\nhim, she had committed an injustice which would constantly be brought\r\nup against her by him and by her own conscience? Had she in truth\r\ndeceived and betrayed him,--deserted him because he was poor, and\r\ngiven herself over to a rich lover because of his riches?\r\n\r\nAs she thought of this she forgot again that fact--which, indeed, she\r\nhad never more than half realized in her mind--that he had justified\r\nher in separating herself from him by his reckless course of living;\r\nthat his conduct must be held to have so justified her, let the\r\npledge between them have been of what nature it might. Now, as she\r\nwalked up and down that path, she thought nothing of his wickedness\r\nand his sins; she thought only of the vows to which she had once\r\nlistened, and the renewal of those vows to which it was now so\r\nnecessary that her ear should be deaf.\r\n\r\nBut was her heart deaf to them? She swore to herself, over and over\r\nagain, scores and scores of oaths, that it was so; but each time that\r\nshe swore, some lowest corner in the depth of her conscience seemed\r\nto charge her with a falsehood. Why was it that in all her hours of\r\nthinking she so much oftener saw his face, Owen\'s, than she did that\r\nother face of which in duty she was bound to think and dream? It\r\nwas in vain that she told herself that she was afraid of Owen, and\r\ntherefore thought of him. The tone of his voice that rang in her\r\nears the oftenest was not that of his anger and sternness, but the\r\ntone of his first assurance of love--that tone which had been so\r\ninexpressibly sweet to her--that to which she had listened on this\r\nvery spot where she now walked slowly, thinking of him. The look of\r\nhis which was ever present to her eyes was not that on which she\r\nhad almost feared to gaze but an hour ago; but the form and spirit\r\nwhich his countenance had worn when they were together on that\r\nwell-remembered day.\r\n\r\nAnd then she would think, or try to think, of Herbert, and of all\r\nhis virtues and of all his goodness. He too loved her well. She\r\nnever doubted that. He had come to her with soft words, and pleasant\r\nsmiles, and sweet honeyed compliments--compliments which had been\r\nsweet to her as they are to all girls; but his soft words, and\r\npleasant smiles, and honeyed love-making had never given her so\r\nstrong a thrill of strange delight as had those few words from\r\nOwen. Her very heart\'s core had been affected by the vigour of his\r\naffection. There had been in it a mysterious grandeur which had half\r\ncharmed and half frightened her. It had made her feel that he, were\r\nit fated that she should belong to him, would indeed be her lord and\r\nruler; that his was a spirit before which hers would bend and feel\r\nitself subdued. With him she could realize all that she had dreamed\r\nof woman\'s love; and that dream which is so sweet to some women--of\r\nwoman\'s subjugation. But could it be the same with him to whom she\r\nwas now positively affianced, with him to whom she knew that she did\r\nnow owe all her duty? She feared that it was not the same.\r\n\r\nAnd then again she swore that she loved him. She thought over all his\r\nexcellences; how good he was as a son--how fondly his sisters loved\r\nhim--how inimitable was his conduct in these hard trying times. And\r\nshe remembered also that it was right in every way that she should\r\nlove him. Her mother and brother approved of it. Those who were to\r\nbe her new relatives approved of it. It was in every way fitting.\r\nPecuniary considerations were so favourable! But when she thought of\r\nthat her heart sank low within her breast. Was it true that she had\r\nsold herself at her mother\'s bidding? Should not the remembrance of\r\nOwen\'s poverty have made her true to him had nothing else done so?\r\n\r\nBut be all that as it might, one thing, at any rate, was clear to\r\nher, that it was now her fate, her duty--and, as she repeated again\r\nand again, her wish to marry Herbert. No thought of rebellion against\r\nhim and her mother ever occurred to her as desirable or possible.\r\nShe would be to him a true and loving wife, a wife in very heart and\r\nsoul. But, nevertheless, walking thus beneath those trees, she could\r\nnot but think of Owen Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nIn this mood she had gone twice down from the house to the lodge and\r\nback again; and now again she had reached the lodge the third time,\r\nmaking thus her last journey: for in these solitary walks her work\r\nwas measured. The exercise was needful, but there was little in the\r\ntask to make her prolong it beyond what was necessary. But now, as\r\nshe was turning for the last time, she heard the sound of a horse\'s\r\nhoof coming fast along the road; and looking from the gate, she saw\r\nthat Herbert was coming to her. She had not expected him, but now she\r\nwaited at the gate to meet him.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that she was to go over in a few days to Castle\r\nRichmond, and stay there for a fortnight. This had been settled\r\nshortly before the visit made by Mr. Mollett junior, at that place,\r\nand had not as yet been unsettled. But as soon as it was known that\r\nSir Thomas had summoned Mr. Prendergast from London, it was felt\r\nby them all that it would be as well that Clara\'s visit should be\r\npostponed. Herbert had been especially cautioned by his father, at\r\nthe time of Mollett\'s visit, not to tell his mother anything of what\r\nhad occurred, and to a certain extent he had kept his promise. But\r\nit was of course necessary that Lady Fitzgerald should know that Mr.\r\nPrendergast was coming to the house, and it was of course impossible\r\nto keep from her the fact that his visit was connected with the\r\nlamentable state of her husband\'s health and spirits. Indeed, she\r\nknew as much as that without any telling. It was not probable that\r\nMr. Prendergast should come there now on a visit of pleasure.\r\n\r\n"Whatever this may be that weighs upon his mind," Herbert had said,\r\n"he will be better for talking it over with a man whom he trusts."\r\n\r\n"And why not with Somers?" said Lady Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"Somers is too often with him, too near to him in all the affairs of\r\nhis life. I really think he is wise to send for Mr. Prendergast. We\r\ndo not know him, but I believe him to be a good man."\r\n\r\nThen Lady Fitzgerald had expressed herself as satisfied--as satisfied\r\nas she could be, seeing that her husband would not take her into his\r\nconfidence; and after this it was settled that Herbert should at once\r\nride over to Desmond Court, and explain that Clara\'s visit had better\r\nbe postponed.\r\n\r\nHerbert got off his horse at the gate, and gave it to one of the\r\nchildren at the lodge to lead after him. His horse would not follow\r\nhim, Clara said to herself as they walked back together towards the\r\nhouse. She could not prevent her mind running off in that direction.\r\nShe would fain not have thought of Owen as she thus hung upon\r\nHerbert\'s arm, but as yet she had not learned to control her\r\nthoughts. His horse had followed him lovingly--the dogs about the\r\nplace had always loved him--the men and women of the whole country\r\nround, old and young, all spoke of him with a sort of love: everybody\r\nadmired him. As all this passed through her brain, she was hanging on\r\nher accepted lover\'s arm, and listening to his soft sweet words.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! it will be much better," she said, answering his proposal\r\nthat she should put off her visit to Castle Richmond. "But I am so\r\nsorry that Sir Thomas should be ill. Mr. Prendergast is not a doctor,\r\nis he?"\r\n\r\nAnd then Herbert explained that Mr. Prendergast was not a doctor,\r\nthat he was a physician for the mind rather than for the body.\r\nRegarding Clara as already one of his own family, he told her as much\r\nas he had told his mother. He explained that there was some deep\r\nsorrow weighing on his father\'s heart of which they none of them knew\r\nanything save its existence; that there might be some misfortune\r\ncoming on Sir Thomas of which he, Herbert, could not even guess the\r\nnature; but that everything would be told to this Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\n"It is very sad," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Very sad; very sad," said Clara, with tears in her eyes. "Poor\r\ngentleman! I wish that we could comfort him."\r\n\r\n"And I do hope that we may," said Herbert. "Somers seems to think\r\nthat his mind is partly affected, and that this misfortune, whatever\r\nit be, may not improbably be less serious than we anticipate;--that\r\nit weighs heavier on him than it would do, were he altogether well."\r\n\r\n"And your mother, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; she also is to be pitied. Sometimes, for moments, she seems\r\nto dread some terrible misfortune; but I believe that in her calm\r\njudgment she thinks that our worst calamity is the state of my\r\nfather\'s health."\r\n\r\nNeither in discussing the matter with his mother or Clara, nor in\r\nthinking it over when alone, did it ever occur to Herbert that he\r\nhimself might be individually subject to the misfortune over which\r\nhis father brooded. Sir Thomas had spoken piteously to him, and\r\ncalled him poor, and had seemed to grieve over what might happen to\r\nhim; but this had been taken by the son as a part of his father\'s\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nEverything around him was now melancholy, and therefore these terms\r\nhad not seemed to have any special force of their own. He did not\r\nthink it necessary to warn Clara that bad days might be in store for\r\nboth of them, or to caution her that their path of love might yet be\r\nmade rough.\r\n\r\n"And whom do you think I met, just now, on horseback?" he asked, as\r\nsoon as this question of her visit had been decided.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Owen Fitzgerald, probably," said Clara. "He went from hence\r\nabout an hour since."\r\n\r\n"Owen Fitzgerald here!" he repeated, as though the tidings of such a\r\nvisit having been made were not exactly pleasant to him. "I thought\r\nthat Lady Desmond did not even see him now."\r\n\r\n"His visit was to me, Herbert, and I will explain it to you. I was\r\njust going to tell you when you first came in, only you began about\r\nCastle Richmond."\r\n\r\n"And have you seen him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, I saw him. Mamma thought it best. Yesterday he wrote a note\r\nto me which I will show you." And then she gave him such an account\r\nof the interview as was possible to her, making it, at any rate,\r\nintelligible to him that Owen had come thither to claim her for\r\nhimself, having heard the rumour of her engagement to his cousin.\r\n\r\n"It was inexcusable on his part--unpardonable!" said Herbert,\r\nspeaking with an angry spot on his face, and with more energy than\r\nwas usual with him.\r\n\r\n"Was it? why?" said Clara, innocently. She felt unconsciously that it\r\nwas painful to her to hear Owen ill spoken of by her lover, and that\r\nshe would fain excuse him if she could.\r\n\r\n"Why, dearest? Think what motives he could have had; what other\r\nobject than to place you in a painful position, and to cause trouble\r\nand vexation to us all. Did he not know that we were engaged?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; he knew that;--at least, no; I am not quite sure--I think he\r\nsaid that he had heard it but did not--"\r\n\r\n"Did not what, love?"\r\n\r\n"I think he said he did not quite believe it;" and then she was\r\nforced, much against her will, to describe to her betrothed how Owen\r\nhad boldly claimed her as his own.\r\n\r\n"His conduct has been unpardonable," said Herbert, again. "Nay, it\r\nhas been ungentlemanlike. He has intruded himself where he well knew\r\nthat he was not wanted; and he has done so taking advantage of a few\r\nwords which, under the present circumstances, he should force himself\r\nto forget."\r\n\r\n"But, Herbert, it is I that have been to blame."\r\n\r\n"No; you have not been in the least to blame. I tell you honestly\r\nthat I can lay no blame at your door. At the age you were then, it\r\nwas impossible that you should know your own mind. And even had your\r\npromise to him been of a much more binding nature, his subsequent\r\nconduct, and your mother\'s remonstrance, as well as your own age,\r\nwould have released you from it without any taint of falsehood. He\r\nknew all this as well as I do; and I am surprised that he should\r\nhave forced his way into your mother\'s house with the mere object of\r\ncausing you embarrassment."\r\n\r\nIt was marvellous how well Herbert Fitzgerald could lay down the law\r\non the subject of Clara\'s conduct, and on all that was due to her,\r\nand all that was not due to Owen. He was the victor; he had gained\r\nthe prize; and therefore it was so easy for him to acquit his\r\npromised bride, and heap reproaches on the head of his rejected\r\nrival. Owen had been told that he was not wanted, and of course\r\nshould have been satisfied with his answer. Why should he intrude\r\nhimself among happy people with his absurd aspirations? For were they\r\nnot absurd? Was it not monstrous on his part to suppose that he could\r\nmarry Clara Desmond?\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that Herbert regarded the matter. But it was not\r\nexactly in that way that Clara looked at it. "He did not force his\r\nway in," she said. "He wrote to ask if we would see him; and mamma\r\nsaid that she thought it better."\r\n\r\n"That is forcing his way in the sense that I meant it; and if I find\r\nthat he gives further annoyance I shall tell him what I think about\r\nit. I will not have you persecuted."\r\n\r\n"Herbert, if you quarrel with him you will make me wretched. I think\r\nit would kill me."\r\n\r\n"I shall not do it if I can help it, Clara. But it is my duty to\r\nprotect you, and if it becomes necessary I must do so; you have\r\nno father, and no brother of an age to speak to him, and that\r\nconsideration alone should have saved you from such an attack."\r\n\r\nClara said nothing more, for she knew that she could not speak out to\r\nhim the feelings of her heart. She could not plead to him that she\r\nhad injured Owen, that she had loved him and then given him up; that\r\nshe had been false to him: she could not confess that, after all,\r\nthe tribute of such a man\'s love could not be regarded by her as\r\nan offence. So she said nothing further, but walked on in silence,\r\nleaning on his arm.\r\n\r\nThey were now close to the house, and as they drew near to it Lady\r\nDesmond met them on the door-step. "I dare say you have heard that\r\nwe had a visitor here this morning," she said, taking Herbert\'s hand\r\nin an affectionate motherly way, and smiling on him with all her\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\nHerbert said that he had heard it, and expressed an opinion that\r\nMr. Owen Fitzgerald would have been acting far more wisely to have\r\nremained at home at Hap House.\r\n\r\n"Yes, perhaps so; certainly so," said Lady Desmond, putting her arm\r\nwithin that of her future son, and walking back with him through\r\nthe great hall. "He would have been wiser; he would have saved dear\r\nClara from a painful half-hour, and he would have saved himself from\r\nperhaps years of sorrow. He has been very foolish to remember Clara\'s\r\nchildhood as he does remember it. But, my dear Herbert, what can we\r\ndo? You lords of creation sometimes will be foolish even about such\r\ntrifling things as women\'s hearts."\r\n\r\nAnd then, when Herbert still persisted that Owen\'s conduct had been\r\ninexcusable and ungentlemanlike, she softly flattered him into\r\nquiescence. "You must not forget," she said, "that he perhaps has\r\nloved Clara almost as truly as you do. And then what harm can he do?\r\nIt is not very probable that he should succeed in winning Clara away\r\nfrom you!"\r\n\r\n"Oh no, it is not that I mean. It is for Clara\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"And she, probably, will never see him again till she is your wife.\r\nThat event will, I suppose, take place at no very remote period."\r\n\r\n"As soon as ever my father\'s health will admit. That is if I can\r\npersuade Clara to be so merciful."\r\n\r\n"To tell the truth, Herbert, I think you could persuade her to\r\nanything. Of course we must not hurry her too much. As for me, my\r\nlosing her will be very sad; you can understand that; but I would not\r\nallow any feeling of my own to stand in her way for half-an-hour."\r\n\r\n"She will be very near you, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she will; and therefore, as I was saying, it would be absurd\r\nfor you to quarrel with Mr. Owen Fitzgerald. For myself, I am sorry\r\nfor him--very sorry for him. You know the whole story of what\r\noccurred between him and Clara, and of course you will understand\r\nthat my duty at that time was plain. Clara behaved admirably, and if\r\nonly he would not be so foolish, the whole matter might be forgotten.\r\nAs far as you and I are concerned I think it may be forgotten."\r\n\r\n"But then his coming here?"\r\n\r\n"That will not be repeated. I thought it better to show him that we\r\nwere not afraid of him, and therefore I permitted it. Had I conceived\r\nthat you would have objected--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Well, there was not much for you to be afraid of, certainly," said\r\nthe countess. And so he was appeased, and left the house promising\r\nthat he, at any rate, would do nothing that might lead to a quarrel\r\nwith his cousin Owen.\r\n\r\nClara, who had still kept on her bonnet, again walked down with him\r\nto the lodge, and encountered his first earnest supplication that an\r\nearly day should be named for their marriage. She had many reasons,\r\nexcellent good reasons, to allege why this should not be the case.\r\nWhen was a girl of seventeen without such reasons? And it is so\r\nreasonable that she should have such reasons. That period of having\r\nlove made to her must be by far the brightest in her life. Is it not\r\nalways a pity that it should be abridged?\r\n\r\n"But your father\'s illness, Herbert, you know."\r\n\r\nHerbert acknowledged that, to a certain extent, his father\'s illness\r\nwas a reason--only to a certain extent. It would be worse than\r\nuseless to think of waiting till his father\'s health should be\r\naltogether strong. Just for the present, till Mr. Prendergast should\r\nhave gone, and perhaps for a fortnight longer, it might be well to\r\nwait. But after that--and then he pressed very closely the hand which\r\nrested on his arm. And so the matter was discussed between them with\r\nlanguage and arguments which were by no means original.\r\n\r\nAt the gate, just as Herbert was about to remount his horse, they\r\nwere encountered by a sight which for years past had not been\r\nuncommon in the south of Ireland, but which had become frightfully\r\ncommon during the last two or three months. A woman was standing\r\nthere, of whom you could hardly say that she was clothed, though she\r\nwas involved in a mass of rags which covered her nakedness. Her head\r\nwas all uncovered, and her wild black hair was streaming round her\r\nface. Behind her back hung two children enveloped among the rags in\r\nsome mysterious way; and round about her on the road stood three\r\nothers, of whom the two younger were almost absolutely naked. The\r\neldest of the five was not above seven. They all had the same wild\r\nblack eyes, and wild elfish straggling locks; but neither the\r\nmother nor the children were comely. She was short and broad in the\r\nshoulders, though wretchedly thin; her bare legs seemed to be of\r\nnearly the same thickness up to the knee, and the naked limbs of the\r\nchildren were like yellow sticks. It is strange how various are the\r\nkinds of physical development among the Celtic peasantry in Ireland.\r\nIn many places they are singularly beautiful, especially as children;\r\nand even after labour and sickness shall have told on them as labour\r\nand sickness will tell, they still retain a certain softness and\r\ngrace which is very nearly akin to beauty. But then again in a\r\nneighbouring district they will be found to be squat, uncouth, and in\r\nno way attractive to the eye. The tint of the complexion, the nature\r\nof the hair, the colour of the eyes, shall be the same. But in one\r\nplace it will seem as though noble blood had produced delicate limbs\r\nand elegant stature, whereas in the other a want of noble blood had\r\nproduced the reverse. The peasants of Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary\r\nare, in this way, much more comely than those of Cork and Kerry.\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert and Clara reached the gate they found this mother with\r\nher five children crouching at the ditch-side, although it was still\r\nmid-winter. They had seen him enter the demesne, and were now waiting\r\nwith the patience of poverty for his return.\r\n\r\n"An\' the holy Virgin guide an\' save you, my lady," said the woman,\r\nalmost frightening Clara by the sudden way in which she came forward,\r\n"an\' you too, Misther Herbert; and for the love of heaven do\r\nsomething for a poor crathur whose five starving childher have not\r\nhad wholesome food within their lips for the last week past."\r\n\r\nClara looked at them piteously and put her hand towards her pocket.\r\nHer purse was never well furnished, and now in these bad days was\r\nusually empty. At the present moment it was wholly so. "I have\r\nnothing to give her; not a penny," she said, whispering to her lover.\r\n\r\nBut Herbert had learned deep lessons of political economy, and was by\r\nno means disposed to give promiscuous charity on the road-side. "What\r\nis your name," said he; "and from where do you come?"\r\n\r\n"Shure, an\' it\'s yer honor knows me well enough; and her ladyship\r\ntoo; may the heavens be her bed. And don\'t I come from Clady; that\r\nis two long miles the fur side of it? And my name is Bridget Sheehy.\r\nShure, an\' yer ladyship remembers me at Clady the first day ye war\r\nover there about the biler."\r\n\r\nClara looked at her, and thought that she did remember her, but she\r\nsaid nothing. "And who is your husband?" said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Murty Brien, plaze yer honor;" and the woman ducked a curtsey with\r\nthe heavy load of two children on her back. It must be understood\r\nthat among the poorer classes in the south and west of Ireland it is\r\nalmost rare for a married woman to call herself or to be called by\r\nher husband\'s name.\r\n\r\n"And is he not at work?"\r\n\r\n"Shure, an\' he is, yer honor--down beyant Kinsale by the say. But\r\nwhat\'s four shilling a week for a man\'s diet, let alone a woman and\r\nfive bairns?"\r\n\r\n"And so he has deserted you?"\r\n\r\n"No, yer honor; he\'s not dasarted me thin. He\'s a good man and\r\na kind, av\' he had the mains. But we\'ve a cabin up here, on her\r\nladyship\'s ground that is; and he has sent me up among my own people,\r\nhoping that times would come round; but faix, yer honor, I\'m thinking\r\nthat they\'ll never come round, no more."\r\n\r\n"And what do you want now, Bridget?"\r\n\r\n"What is it I\'m wanting? just a thrifle of money then to get a sup of\r\nmilk for thim five childher as is starving and dying for the want of\r\nit." And she pointed to the wretched, naked brood around her with a\r\ngesture which in spite of her ugliness had in it something of tragic\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\n"But you know that we will not give money. They will take you in at\r\nthe poorhouse at Kanturk."\r\n\r\n"Is it the poorhouse, yer honor?"\r\n\r\n"Or, if you get a ticket from your priest they will give you meal\r\ntwice a week at Clady. You know that. Why do you not go to Father\r\nConnellan?"\r\n\r\n"Is it the mail? An\' shure an\' haven\'t I had it, the last month past;\r\nnothin\' else; not a taste of a piaty or a dhrop of milk for nigh a\r\nmonth, and now look at the childher. Look at them, my lady. They are\r\ndyin\' by the very road-side." And she undid the bundle at her back,\r\nand laying the two babes down on the road showed that the elder of\r\nthem was in truth in a fearful state. It was a child nearly two years\r\nof age, but its little legs seemed to have withered away; its cheeks\r\nwere wan, and yellow and sunken, and the two teeth which it had\r\nalready cut were seen with terrible plainness through its emaciated\r\nlips. Its head and forehead were covered with sores; and then the\r\nmother, moving aside the rags, showed that its back and legs were in\r\nthe same state. "Look to that," she said, almost with scorn. "That\'s\r\nwhat the mail has done--my black curses be upon it, and the day that\r\nit first come nigh the counthry." And then again she covered the\r\nchild and began to resume her load.\r\n\r\n"Do give her something, Herbert, pray do," said Clara, with her whole\r\nface suffused with tears.\r\n\r\n"You know that we cannot give away money," said Herbert, arguing\r\nwith Bridget Sheehy, and not answering Clara at the moment. "You\r\nunderstand enough of what is being done to know that. Why do you not\r\ngo into the Union?"\r\n\r\n"Shure thin an\' I\'ll jist tramp on as fur as Hap House, I and my\r\nchildher; that is av\' they do not die by the road-side. Come on,\r\nbairns. Mr. Owen won\'t be afther sending me to the Kanturk union when\r\nI tell him that I\'ve travelled all thim miles to get a dhrink of\r\nmilk for a sick babe; more by token when I tells him also that I\'m\r\none of the Desmond tinantry. It\'s he that loves the Desmonds, Lady\r\nClara,--loves them as his own heart\'s blood. And it\'s I that wish him\r\ngood luck with his love, in spite of all that\'s come and gone yet.\r\nCome on, bairns, come along; we have seven weary miles to walk." And\r\nthen, having rearranged her burden on her back, she prepared again to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald, from the first moment of his interrogating the\r\nwoman, had of course known that he would give her somewhat. In spite\r\nof all his political economy, there were but few days in which he\r\ndid not empty his pocket of his loose silver, with these culpable\r\ndeviations from his theoretical philosophy. But yet he felt that it\r\nwas his duty to insist on his rules, as far as his heart would allow\r\nhim to do so. It was a settled thing at their relief committee that\r\nthere should be no giving away of money to chance applicants for\r\nalms. What money each had to bestow would go twice further by being\r\nbrought to the general fund--by being expended with forethought and\r\ndiscrimination. This was the system which all attempted, which all\r\nresolved to adopt who were then living in the south of Ireland.\r\nBut the system was impracticable, for it required frames of iron\r\nand hearts of adamant. It was impossible not to waste money in\r\nalmsgiving.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Herbert!" said Clara, imploringly, as the woman prepared to\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n"Bridget, come here," said Herbert, and he spoke very seriously, for\r\nthe woman\'s allusion to Owen Fitzgerald had driven a cloud across\r\nhis brow. "Your child is very ill, and therefore I will give you\r\nsomething to help you," and he gave her a shilling and two sixpences.\r\n\r\n"May the God in heaven bless you thin, and make you happy, whoever\r\nwins the bright darling by your side; and may the good days come back\r\nto yer house and all that belongs to it. May yer wife clave to you\r\nall her days, and be a good mother to your childher." And she would\r\nhave gone on further with her blessing had not he interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Go on now, my good woman," said he, "and take your children where\r\nthey may be warm. If you will be advised by me, you will go to the\r\nUnion at Kanturk." And so the woman passed on still blessing them.\r\nVery shortly after this none of them required pressing to go to the\r\nworkhouse. Every building that could be arranged for the purpose was\r\nfilled to overflowing as soon as it was ready. But the worst of the\r\nfamine had not come upon them as yet. And then Herbert rode back to\r\nCastle Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nFATHER BARNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMick O\'Dwyer\'s public-house at Kanturk was by no means so pretentious\r\nan establishment as that kept by his brother in South Main Street,\r\nCork, but it was on the whole much less nasty. It was a drinking-shop\r\nand a public car office, and such places in Ireland are seldom very\r\nnice; but there was no attempt at hotel grandeur, and the little\r\nroom in which the family lived behind the bar was never invaded by\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\nOn one evening just at this time--at the time, that is, with which we\r\nhave been lately concerned--three persons were sitting in this room\r\nover a cup of tea. There was a gentleman, middle-aged, but none the\r\nworse on that account, who has already been introduced in these pages\r\nas Father Bernard M\'Carthy. He was the parish priest of Drumbarrow;\r\nand as his parish comprised a portion of the town of Kanturk, he\r\nlived, not exactly in the town, but within a mile of it. His sister\r\nhad married Mr. O\'Dwyer of South Main Street, and therefore he was\r\nquite at home in the little back parlour of Mick O\'Dwyer\'s house in\r\nKanturk. Indeed Father Bernard was a man who made himself at home in\r\nthe houses of most of his parishioners,--and of some who were not his\r\nparishioners.\r\n\r\nHis companions on the present occasion were two ladies who seemed to\r\nbe emulous in supplying his wants. The younger and more attractive\r\nof the two was also an old friend of ours, being no other than\r\nFanny O\'Dwyer from South Main Street. Actuated, doubtless, by some\r\nimportant motive she had left her bar at home for one night, having\r\ncome down to Kanturk by her father\'s car, with the intention of\r\nreturning by it in the morning. She was seated as a guest here on the\r\ncorner of the sofa near the fire, but nevertheless she was neither\r\ntoo proud nor too strange in her position to administer as best she\r\nmight to the comfort of her uncle.\r\n\r\nThe other lady was Mistress O\'Dwyer, the lady of the mansion. She was\r\nfat, very; by no means fair, and perhaps something over forty. But\r\nnevertheless there were those who thought that she had her charms.\r\nA better hand at curing a side of bacon there was not in the county\r\nCork, nor a woman who was more knowing in keeping a house straight\r\nand snug over her husband\'s head. That she had been worth more than\r\na fortune to Mick O\'Dwyer was admitted by all in Kanturk; for it was\r\nknown to all that Mick O\'Dwyer was not himself a good hand at keeping\r\na house straight and snug.\r\n\r\n"Another cup of tay, Father Bernard," said this lady. "It\'ll be\r\nmore to your liking now than the first, you\'ll find." Father Barney,\r\nperfectly reliant on her word, handed in his cup.\r\n\r\n"And the muffin is quite hot," said Fanny, stooping down to a tray\r\nwhich stood before the peat fire, holding the muffin dish. "But\r\nperhaps you\'d like a morsel of buttered toast; say the word, uncle,\r\nand I\'ll make it in a brace of seconds."\r\n\r\n"In course she will," said Mrs. O\'Dwyer: "and happy too, av you\'ll\r\nonly say that you have a fancy, Father Bernard."\r\n\r\nBut Father Bernard would not own to any such fancy. The muffin, he\r\nsaid, was quite to his liking, and so was the tea; and from the\r\nmanner in which he disposed of these delicacies, even Mrs. Townsend\r\nmight have admitted that this assertion was true, though she was\r\nwont to express her belief that nothing but lies could, by any\r\npossibility, fall from his mouth.\r\n\r\n"And they have been staying with you now for some weeks, haven\'t\r\nthey?" said Father Barney.\r\n\r\n"Off and on," said Fanny.\r\n\r\n"But there\'s one of them mostly there, isn\'t he?" added the priest.\r\n\r\n"The two of them is mostly there, just now. Sometimes one goes away\r\nfor a day or two, and sometimes the other."\r\n\r\n"And they have no business which keeps them in Cork?" continued the\r\npriest, who seemed to be very curious on the matter.\r\n\r\n"Well, they do have business, I suppose," said Fanny, "but av so\r\nI never sees it." Fanny O\'Dwyer had a great respect for her uncle,\r\nseeing that he filled an exalted position, and was a connexion of\r\nwhom she could be justly proud; but, though she had now come down to\r\nKanturk with the view of having a good talk with her aunt and uncle\r\nabout the Molletts, she would only tell as much as she liked to tell,\r\neven to the parish priest of Drumbarrow. And we may as well explain\r\nhere that Fanny had now permanently made up her mind to reject the\r\nsuit of Mr. Abraham Mollett. As she had allowed herself to see more\r\nand more of the little domestic ways of that gentleman, and to become\r\nintimate with him as a girl should become with the man she intends\r\nto marry, she had gradually learned to think that he hardly came up\r\nto her beau ideal of a lover. That he was crafty and false did not\r\nperhaps offend her as it should have done. Dear Fanny, excellent and\r\ngracious as she was, could herself be crafty on occasions. He drank\r\ntoo, but that came in the way of her profession. It is hard, perhaps,\r\nfor a barmaid to feel much severity against that offence. But in\r\naddition to this Aby was selfish and cruel and insolent, and seldom\r\naltogether good tempered. He was bad to his father, and bad to those\r\nbelow him whom he employed. Old Mollett would give away his sixpences\r\nwith a fairly liberal hand, unless when he was exasperated by drink\r\nand fatigue. But Aby seldom gave away a penny. Fanny had sharp eyes,\r\nand soon felt that her English lover was not a man to be loved,\r\nthough he had two rings, a gold chain, and half a dozen fine\r\nwaistcoats.\r\n\r\nAnd then another offence had come to light in which the Molletts were\r\nboth concerned. Since their arrival in South Main Street they had\r\nbeen excellent customers--indeed quite a godsend, in this light, to\r\nFanny, who had her own peculiar profit out of such house-customers\r\nas they were. They had paid their money like true Britons,--not\r\nregularly indeed, for regularity had not been desired, but by a five\r\npound now, and another in a day or two, just as they were wanted.\r\nNothing indeed could be better than this, for bills so paid are\r\nseldom rigidly scrutinized. But of late, within the last week,\r\nFanny\'s requests for funds had not been so promptly met, and only on\r\nthe day before her visit to Kanturk she had been forced to get her\r\nfather to take a bill from Mr. Mollett senior for \xa320 at two months\'\r\ndate. This was a great come-down, as both Fanny and her father felt,\r\nand they had begun to think that it might be well to bring their\r\nconnexion with the Molletts to a close. What if an end had come to\r\nthe money of these people, and their bills should be dishonoured when\r\ndue? It was all very well for a man to have claims against Sir Thomas\r\nFitzgerald, but Fanny O\'Dwyer had already learnt that nothing goes so\r\nfar in this world as ready cash.\r\n\r\n"They do have business, I suppose," said Fanny.\r\n\r\n"It won\'t be worth much, I\'m thinking," said Mrs. O\'Dwyer, "when they\r\ncan\'t pay their weekly bills at a house of public entertainment,\r\nwithout flying their names at two months\' date."\r\n\r\nMrs. O\'Dwyer hated any such payments herself, and looked on them as\r\ncertain signs of immorality. That every man should take his drop of\r\ndrink, consume it noiselessly, and pay for it immediately--that was\r\nher idea of propriety in its highest form.\r\n\r\n"And they\'ve been down here three or four times, each of them," said\r\nFather Barney, thinking deeply on the subject.\r\n\r\n"I believe they have," said Fanny. "But of course I don\'t know much\r\nof where they\'ve been to."\r\n\r\nFather Barney knew very well that his dear niece had been on much\r\nmore intimate terms with her guest than she pretended. The rumours\r\nhad reached his ears some time since that the younger of the two\r\nstrangers in South Main Street was making himself agreeable to the\r\nheiress of the hotel, and he had intended to come down upon her with\r\nall the might of an uncle, and, if necessary, with all the authority\r\nof the Church. But now that Fanny had discarded her lover, he wisely\r\nfelt that it would be well for him to know nothing about it. Both\r\nuncles and priests may know too much--very foolishly.\r\n\r\n"I have seen them here myself," said he, "and they have both been up\r\nat Castle Richmond."\r\n\r\n"They do say as poor Sir Thomas is in a bad way," said Mrs. O\'Dwyer,\r\nshaking her head piteously.\r\n\r\n"And yet he sees these men," said Father Barney. "I know that\r\nfor certain. He has seen them, though he will rarely see anybody\r\nnow-a-days."\r\n\r\n"Young Mr. Herbert is a-doing most of the business up about the\r\nplace," said Mrs. O\'Dwyer. "And people do say as how he is going to\r\nmake a match of it with Lady Clara Desmond. And it\'s the lucky girl\r\nshe\'ll be, for he\'s a nice young fellow entirely."\r\n\r\n"Not half equal to her other Joe, Mr. Owen that is," said Fanny.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know that, my dear. Such a house and property as\r\nCastle Richmond is not likely to go a-begging among the young women.\r\nAnd then Mr. Herbert is not so rampageous like as him of Hap House,\r\nby all accounts."\r\n\r\nBut Father Barney still kept to his subject. "And they are both at\r\nyour place at the present moment, eh, Fanny?"\r\n\r\n"They was to dine there, after I left."\r\n\r\n"And the old man said he\'d be down here again next Thursday,"\r\ncontinued the priest. "I heard that for certain. I\'ll tell you what\r\nit is, they\'re not after any good here. They are Protestants, ain\'t\r\nthey?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, black Protestants," said Mrs. O\'Dwyer. "But you are not taking\r\nyour tay, Father Bernard," and she again filled his cup for him.\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll take my advice, Fanny, you\'ll give them nothing more\r\nwithout seeing their money. They\'ll come to no good here, I\'m sure of\r\nthat. They\'re afther some mischief with that poor old gentleman at\r\nCastle Richmond, and it\'s my belief the police will have them before\r\nthey\'ve done."\r\n\r\n"Like enough," said Mrs. O\'Dwyer.\r\n\r\n"They may have them to-morrow, for what I care," said Fanny, who\r\ncould not help feeling that Aby Mollett had at one time been not\r\naltogether left without hope as her suitor.\r\n\r\n"But you wouldn\'t like anything like that to happen in your father\'s\r\nhouse," said Father Barney.\r\n\r\n"Bringing throuble and disgrace on an honest name," said Mrs.\r\nO\'Dwyer.\r\n\r\n"There\'d be no disgrace as I knows of," said Fanny, stoutly. "Father\r\nmakes his money by the public, and in course he takes in any that\r\ncomes the way with money in their pockets to pay the shot."\r\n\r\n"But these Molletts ain\'t got the money to pay the shot," said Mrs.\r\nO\'Dwyer, causticly. "You\'ve about sucked \'em dhry, I\'m thinking, and\r\nthey owes you more now than you\'re like to get from \'em."\r\n\r\n"I suppose father \'ll have to take that bill up," said Fanny,\r\nassenting. And so it was settled down there among them that the\r\nMolletts were to have the cold shoulder, and that they should in fact\r\nbe turned out of the Kanturk Hotel as quickly as this could be done.\r\n"Better a small loss at first, than a big one at last," said Mrs.\r\nO\'Dwyer, with much wisdom. "They\'ll come to mischief down here, as\r\nsure as my name\'s M\'Carthy," said the priest. "And I\'d be sorry your\r\nfather should be mixed up in it."\r\n\r\nAnd then by degrees the conversation was changed, but not till the\r\ntea-things had been taken away, and a square small bottle of very\r\nparticular whisky put on the table in its place. And the sugar also\r\nwas brought, and boiling water in an immense jug, as though Father\r\nBarney were going to make a deep potation indeed, and a lemon in a\r\nwine glass; and then the priest was invited, with much hospitality,\r\nto make himself comfortable. Nor did the luxuries prepared for him\r\nend here; but Fanny, the pretty Fan herself, filled a pipe for him,\r\nand pretended that she would light it, for such priests are merry\r\nenough sometimes, and can joke as well as other men with their pretty\r\nnieces.\r\n\r\n"But you\'re not mixing your punch, Father Bernard," said Mrs.\r\nO\'Dwyer, with a plaintive melancholy voice, "and the wather getting\r\ncowld and all! Faix then, Father Bernard, I\'ll mix it for ye, so\r\nI will." And so she did, and well she knew how. And then she made\r\nanother for herself and her niece, urging that "a thimbleful\r\nwould do Fanny all the good in life afther her ride acrass them\r\ncowld mountains," and the priest looked on assenting, blowing the\r\ncomfortable streams of smoke from his nostrils.\r\n\r\n"And so, Father Bernard, you and Parson Townsend is to meet again\r\nto-morrow at Gortnaclough." Whereupon Father Bernard owned that such\r\nwas the case, with a nod, not caring to disturb the pipe which lay\r\ncomfortably on his lower lip.\r\n\r\n"Well, well; only to think on it," continued Mrs. O\'Dwyer. "That the\r\nsame room should hould the two of ye." And she lifted up her hands\r\nand shook her head.\r\n\r\n"It houlds us both very comfortable, I can assure you, Mrs. O\'Dwyer."\r\n\r\n"And he ain\'t rampageous and highty-tighty? He don\'t give hisself no\r\nairs?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; nothing in particular. Why should the man be such a fool\r\nas that?"\r\n\r\n"Why, in course? But they are such fools, Father Bernard. They does\r\nthink theyselves such grand folks. Now don\'t they? I\'d give a dandy\r\nof punch all round to the company just to hear you put him down once;\r\nI would. But he isn\'t upsetting at all, then?"\r\n\r\n"Not the last time we met, he wasn\'t; and I don\'t think he intends\r\nit. Things have come to that now that the parsons know where they are\r\nand what they have to look to. They\'re getting a lesson they\'ll not\r\nforget in a hurry. Where are their rent charges to come from--can you\r\ntell me that, Mrs. O\'Dwyer?"\r\n\r\nMrs. O\'Dwyer could not, but she remarked that pride would always have\r\na fall. "And there\'s no pride like Protesthant pride," said Fanny.\r\n"It is so upsetting, I can\'t abide it." All which tended to show that\r\nshe had quite given up her Protestant lover.\r\n\r\n"And is it getthing worse than iver with the poor crathurs?" said\r\nMrs. O\'Dwyer, referring, not to the Protestants, but to the victims\r\nof the famine.\r\n\r\n"Indeed it\'s getting no betther," said the priest, "and I\'m fearing\r\nit will be worse before it is over. I haven\'t married one couple in\r\nDrumbarrow since November last."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s a heavy sign, Father Bernard."\r\n\r\n"The surest sign in the world that they have no money among them at\r\nall, at all. And it is bad with thim, Mrs. O\'Dwyer,--very bad, very\r\nbad indeed."\r\n\r\n"Glory be to God, the poor cratures!" said the soft-hearted lady.\r\n"It isn\'t much the like of us have to give away, Father Bernard; I\r\nneedn\'t be telling you that. But we\'ll help, you know,--we\'ll help."\r\n\r\n"And so will father, uncle Bernard. If you\'re so bad off about here\r\nI know he\'ll give you a thrifle for the asking." In a short time,\r\nhowever, it came to pass that those in the cities could spare no aid\r\nto the country. Indeed it may be a question whether the city poverty\r\nwas not the harder of the two.\r\n\r\n"God bless you both--you\'ve soft hearts, I know." And Father Barney\r\nput his punch to his lips. "Whatever you can do for me shall not be\r\nthrown away. And I\'ll tell you what, Mrs. O\'Dwyer, it does behove us\r\nall to put our best foot out now. We will not let them say that the\r\nPapists would do nothing for their own poor."\r\n\r\n"\'Deed then an\' they\'ll say anything of us, Father Bernard. There\'s\r\nnothing too hot or too heavy for them."\r\n\r\n"At any rate let us not deserve it, Mrs. O\'Dwyer. There will be a lot\r\nof them at Gortnaclough to-morrow, and I shall tell them that we, on\r\nour side, won\'t be wanting. To give them their due, I must say that\r\nthey are working well. That young Herbert Fitzgerald\'s a trump,\r\nwhether he\'s Protestant or Catholic."\r\n\r\n"An\' they do say he\'s a strong bearing towards the ould religion,"\r\nsaid Mrs. O\'Dwyer. "God bless his sweet young face av\' he\'d come back\r\nto us. That\'s what I say."\r\n\r\n"God bless his face any way, say I," said Father Barney, with a wider\r\nphilanthropy. "He is doing his best for the people, and the time has\r\ncome now when we must hang together, if it be any way possible." And\r\nwith this the priest finished his pipe, and wishing the ladies good\r\nnight, walked away to his own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE RELIEF COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time the famine was beginning to be systematised. The\r\nsternest among landlords and masters were driven to acknowledge that\r\nthe people had not got food or the means of earning it. The people\r\nthemselves were learning that a great national calamity had happened,\r\nand that the work was God\'s work; and the Government had fully\r\nrecognized the necessity of taking the whole matter into its own\r\nhands. They were responsible for the preservation of the people, and\r\nthey acknowledged their responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd then two great rules seemed to get themselves laid down--not by\r\ngeneral consent, for there were many who greatly contested their\r\nwisdom--but by some force strong enough to make itself dominant.\r\nThe first was, that the food to be provided should be earned and\r\nnot given away. And the second was, that the providing of that\r\nfood should be left to private competition, and not in any way be\r\nundertaken by the Government. I make bold to say that both these\r\nrules were wise and good.\r\n\r\nBut how should the people work? That Government should supply\r\nthe wages was of course an understood necessity; and it was also\r\nnecessary that on all such work the amount of wages should be\r\nregulated by the price at which provisions might fix themselves.\r\nThese points produced questions which were hotly debated by the\r\nRelief Committees of the different districts; but at last it got\r\nitself decided, again by the hands of Government, that all hills\r\nalong the country roads should be cut away, and that the people\r\nshould be employed on this work. They were so employed,--very little\r\nto the advantage of the roads for that or some following years.\r\n\r\n"So you have begun, my men," said Herbert to a gang of labourers whom\r\nhe found collected at a certain point on Ballydahan Hill, which lay\r\non his road from Castle Richmond to Gortnaclough. In saying this\r\nhe had certainly paid them an unmerited compliment, for they had\r\nhitherto begun nothing. Some thirty or forty wretched-looking men\r\nwere clustered together in the dirt and slop and mud, on the brow\r\nof the hill, armed with such various tools as each was able to\r\nfind--with tools, for the most part, which would go but a little\r\nway in making Ballydahan Hill level or accessible. This question of\r\ntools also came to a sort of understood settlement before long; and\r\nwithin three months of the time of which I am writing legions of\r\nwheelbarrows were to be seen lying near every hill; wheelbarrows in\r\nhundreds and thousands. The fate of those myriads of wheelbarrows has\r\nalways been a mystery to me.\r\n\r\n"So you have begun, my men," said Herbert, addressing them in a\r\nkindly voice. There was a couple of gangsmen with them, men a\r\nlittle above the others in appearance, but apparently incapable\r\nof commencing the work in hand, for they also were standing idle,\r\nleaning against a bit of wooden paling. It had, however, been decided\r\nthat the works at Ballydahan Hill should begin on this day, and there\r\nwere the men assembled. One fact admitted of no doubt, namely, this,\r\nthat the wages would begin from this day.\r\n\r\nAnd then the men came and clustered round Herbert\'s horse. They were\r\nwretched-looking creatures, half-clad, discontented, with hungry\r\neyes, each having at his heart\'s core a deep sense of injustice done\r\npersonally upon him. They hated this work of cutting hills from the\r\ncommencement to the end,--hated it, though it was to bring them wages\r\nand save them and theirs from actual famine and death. They had not\r\nbeen accustomed to the discomfort of being taken far from their homes\r\nto their daily work. Very many of them had never worked regularly\r\nfor wages, day after day, and week after week. Up to this time such\r\nwas not the habit of Irish cottiers. They held their own land, and\r\nlaboured there for a spell; and then they would work for a spell, as\r\nmen do in England, taking wages; and then they would be idle for a\r\nspell. It was not exactly a profitable mode of life, but it had its\r\ncomforts; and now these unfortunates who felt themselves to be driven\r\nforth like cattle in droves for the first time, suffered the full\r\nwretchedness of their position. They were not rough and unruly, or\r\ninclined to be troublesome and perhaps violent, as men similarly\r\ncircumstanced so often are in England;--as Irishmen are when\r\ncollected in gangs out of Ireland. They had no aptitudes for\r\nsuch roughness, and no spirits for such violence. But they were\r\nmelancholy, given to complaint, apathetic, and utterly without\r\ninterest in that they were doing.\r\n\r\n"Yz, yer honer," said one man who was standing, shaking himself, with\r\nhis hands enveloped in the rags of his pockets. He had on no coat,\r\nand the keen north wind seemed to be blowing through his bones; cold,\r\nhowever, as he was, he would do nothing towards warming himself,\r\nunless that occasional shake can be considered as a doing of\r\nsomething. "Yz, yer honer; we\'ve begun thin since before daylight\r\nthis blessed morning."\r\n\r\nIt was now eleven o\'clock, and a pick-axe had not been put into the\r\nground, nor the work marked.\r\n\r\n"Been here before daylight!" said Herbert. "And has there been nobody\r\nto set you to work?"\r\n\r\n"Divil a sowl, yer honer," said another, who was sitting on a\r\nhedge-bank leaning with both his hands on a hoe, which he held\r\nbetween his legs, "barring Thady Molloy and Shawn Brady; they two do\r\nbe over us, but they knows nothin\' o\' such jobs as this."\r\n\r\nThady Molloy and Shawn Brady had with the others moved up so as\r\nto be close to Herbert\'s horse, but they said not a word towards\r\nvindicating their own fitness for command.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s mortial cowld standing here thin," said another, "without\r\na bit to ate or a sup to dhrink since last night, and then only a\r\nlump of the yally mail." And the speaker moved about on his toes and\r\nheels, desirous of keeping his blood in circulation with the smallest\r\npossible amount of trouble.\r\n\r\n"I\'m telling the boys it\'s home we\'d betther be going," said a\r\nfourth.\r\n\r\n"And lose the tizzy they\'ve promised us," said he of the hoe.\r\n\r\n"Sorrow a tizzy they\'ll pay any of yez for standing here all day,"\r\nsaid an ill-looking little wretch of a fellow, with a black muzzle\r\nand a squinting eye; "ye may all die in the road first." And the man\r\nturned away among the crowd, as an Irishman does who has made his\r\nspeech and does not want to be answered.\r\n\r\n"You need have no fear about that, my men," said Herbert. "Whether\r\nyou be put to work or no you\'ll receive your wages; you may take my\r\nword for that."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been telling \'em that for the last half-hour," said the man\r\nwith the hoe, now rising to his feet. "\'Shure an\' didn\'t Mr. Somers\r\nbe telling us that we\'d have saxpence each day as long we war here\r\nafore daylight?\' said I, yer honer; \'an\' shure an\' wasn\'t it black\r\nnight when we war here this blessed morning, and devil a fear of the\r\ntizzy?\' said I. But it\'s mortial cowld, an\' it\'d be asier for uz to\r\nbe doing a spell of work than crouching about on our hunkers down on\r\nthe wet ground."\r\n\r\nAll this was true. It had been specially enjoined upon them to be\r\nearly at their work. An Irishman as a rule will not come regularly to\r\nhis task. It is a very difficult thing to secure his services every\r\nmorning at six o\'clock; but make a special point,--tell him that you\r\nwant him very early, and he will come to you in the middle of the\r\nnight. Breakfast every morning punctually at eight o\'clock is almost\r\nimpossible in Ireland; but if you want one special breakfast, so that\r\nyou may start by a train at 4 A.M., you are sure to be served. No\r\nirregular effort is distasteful to an Irishman of the lower classes,\r\nnot if it entails on him the loss of a day\'s food and the loss of a\r\nnight\'s rest; the actual pleasure of the irregularity repays him for\r\nall this, and he never tells you that this or that is not his work.\r\nHe prefers work that is not his own. Your coachman will have no\r\nobjection to turn the mangle, but heaven and earth put together won\'t\r\npersuade him to take the horses out to exercise every morning at the\r\nsame hour. These men had been told to come early, and they had been\r\nthere on the road-side since five o\'clock. It was not surprising that\r\nthey were cold and hungry, listless and unhappy.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as young Fitzgerald was questioning the so-named gangmen\r\nas to the instructions they had received, a jaunting car came up to\r\nthe foot of the hill. "We war to wait for the ongineer," Shawn Brady\r\nhad said, "an\' shure an\' we have waited." "An\' here\'s one of Misther\r\nCarroll\'s cars from Mallow," said Thady Molloy, "and that\'s the\r\nongineer hisself." Thady Molloy was right; this was the engineer\r\nhimself, who had now arrived from Mallow. From this time forth, and\r\nfor the next twelve months, the country was full of engineers, or of\r\nmen who were so called. I do not say this in disparagement; but the\r\nengineers were like the yellow meal. When there is an immense demand,\r\nand that a suddenly immense demand, for any article, it is seldom\r\neasy to get it very good. In those days men became engineers with a\r\nshort amount of apprenticeship, but, as a rule, they did not do their\r\nwork badly. In such days as those, men, if they be men at all, will\r\nput their shoulders to the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe engineer was driven up to where they were standing, and he\r\njumped off the car among the men who were to work under him with\r\nrather a pretentious air. He had not observed, or probably had not\r\nknown, Herbert Fitzgerald. He was a very young fellow, still under\r\none-and-twenty, beardless, light-haired, blue-eyed, and fresh from\r\nEngland. "And what hill is this?" said he to the driver.\r\n\r\n"Ballydahan, shure, yer honer. That last war Connick-a-coppul, and\r\nthat other, the big un intirely, where the crass road takes away to\r\nButtevant, that was Glounthauneroughtymore. Faix and that\'s been the\r\nmurthering hill for cattle since first I knew it. Bedad yer honer \'ll\r\nmake it smooth as a bowling-green."\r\n\r\n"Ballydahan," said the young man, taking a paper out of his pocket\r\nand looking up the names in his list, "I\'ve got it. There should be\r\nthirty-seven of them here."\r\n\r\n"Shure an\' here we are these siven hours," said our friend of the\r\nhoe, "and mighty cowld we are."\r\n\r\n"Thady Molloy and Shawn Brady," called out the engineer, managing\r\nthoroughly to Anglicise the pronunciation of the names, though they\r\nwere not Celtically composite to any great degree.\r\n\r\n"Yez, we\'s here," said Thady, coming forward. And then Herbert came\r\nup and introduced himself, and the young engineer took off his hat.\r\n"I came away from Mallow before eight," said he apologetically; "but\r\nI have four of these places to look after, and when one gets to one\r\nof them it is impossible to get away again. There was one place where\r\nI was kept two hours before I could get one of the men to understand\r\nwhat they were to do. What is it you call that big hill?"\r\n\r\n"Glounthauneroughtymore, yer honer," said the driver, to whom the\r\nname was as easy and familiar as his own.\r\n\r\n"And you are going to set these men to work now?" said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t suppose they\'ll do much to-day, Mr. Fitzgerald. But\r\nI must try and explain to the head men how they are to begin. They\r\nhave none of them any tools, you see." And then he called out again.\r\n"Thady Molloy and Shawn Brady."\r\n\r\n"We\'s here," said Thady again; "we did not exactly know whether yer\r\nhoner\'d be afther beginning at the top or the botthom. That\'s all\r\nthat war staying us."\r\n\r\n"Never fear," said Shawn, "but we\'ll have ould Ballydahan level in\r\nless than no time. We\'re the boys that can do it, fair and aisy."\r\n\r\nIt appeared to Herbert that the young engineer seemed to be rather\r\nbewildered by the job of work before him, and therefore he rode on,\r\nnot stopping to embarrass him by any inspection of his work. In\r\nprocess of time no doubt so much of the top of Ballydahan Hill was\r\ncarried to the bottom as made the whole road altogether impassable\r\nfor many months. But the great object was gained; the men were fed,\r\nand were not fed by charity. What did it matter, that the springs of\r\nevery conveyance in the county Cork were shattered by the process,\r\nand that the works resulted in myriads of wheelbarrows?\r\n\r\nAnd then, as he rode on towards Gortnaclough, Herbert was overtaken\r\nby his friend the parson, who was also going to the meeting of the\r\nrelief committee. "You have not seen the men at Ballydahan Hill, have\r\nyou?" said Herbert.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend explained that he had not seen them. His road had struck\r\non to that on which they now were not far from the top of the hill.\r\n"But I knew they were to be there this morning," said Mr. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"They have sent quite a lad of a fellow to show them how to work,"\r\nsaid Herbert. "I fear we shall all come to grief with these\r\nroad-cuttings."\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake don\'t say that at the meeting," said Mr. Townsend,\r\n"or you\'ll be playing the priests\' game out and out. Father Barney\r\nhas done all in his power to prevent the works."\r\n\r\n"But what if Father Barney be right?" said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"But he\'s not right," said the parson, energetically. "He\'s\r\naltogether wrong. I never knew one of them right in my life yet in\r\nanything. How can they be right?"\r\n\r\n"But I think you are mixing up road-making and Church doctrine, Mr.\r\nTownsend."\r\n\r\n"I hope I may never be in danger of mixing up God and the devil.\r\nYou cannot touch pitch and not be defiled. Remember that, Herbert\r\nFitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"I will remember nothing of the kind," said Herbert. "Am I to set\r\nmyself up as a judge and say that this is pitch and that is pitch? Do\r\nyou remember St. Peter on the housetop? Was not he afraid of what was\r\nunclean?"\r\n\r\n"The meaning of that was that he was to convert the Gentiles, and\r\nnot give way to their errors. He was to contend with them and not\r\ngive way an inch till he had driven them from their idolatry." Mr.\r\nTownsend had been specially primed by his wife that morning with\r\nvigorous hostility against Father Barney, and was grieved to his\r\nheart at finding that his young friend was prepared to take the\r\npriest\'s part in anything. In this matter of the roads Mr. Townsend\r\nwas doubtless right, but hardly on the score of the arguments\r\nassigned by him.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean to say that there should be no road-making," said\r\nHerbert, after a pause. "The general opinion seems to be that we\r\ncan\'t do better. I only say that we shall come to grief about it.\r\nThose poor fellows there have as much idea of cutting down a hill as\r\nI have; and it seems to me that the young lad whom I left with them\r\nhas not much more."\r\n\r\n"They\'ll learn all in good time."\r\n\r\n"Let us hope it will be in good time."\r\n\r\n"If we once let them have the idea that we are to feed them in\r\nidleness," said Mr. Townsend, "they will want to go on for ever in\r\nthe same way. And then, when they receive such immense sums in money\r\nwages, the priests will be sure to get their share. If the matter had\r\nbeen left to me, I would have paid the men in meal. I would never\r\nhave given them money. They should have worked and got their food.\r\nThe priest will get a penny out of every shilling; you\'ll see else."\r\nAnd so the matter was discussed between them as they went along to\r\nGortnaclough.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the room in which the committee was held they found\r\nMr. Somers already in the chair. Priest McCarthy was there also,\r\nwith his coadjutor, the Rev. Columb Creagh--Father Columb as he was\r\nalways called; and there was a Mr. O\'Leary from Boherbuy, one of the\r\nmiddlemen as they were formerly named,--though by the way I never\r\nknew that word to be current in Ireland; it is familiar to all, and\r\nwas I suppose common some few years since, but I never heard the\r\npeasants calling such persons by that title. He was one of those with\r\nwhom the present times were likely to go very hard. He was not a bad\r\nman, unless in so far as this, that he had no idea of owing any duty\r\nto others beyond himself and his family. His doctrine at present\r\namounted to this, that if you left the people alone and gave them no\r\nfalse hopes, they would contrive to live somehow. He believed in a\r\ngood deal, but he had no belief whatever in starvation,--none as yet.\r\nIt was probable enough that some belief in this might come to him\r\nnow before long. There were also one or two others; men who had some\r\nstake in the country, but men who hadn\'t a tithe of the interest\r\npossessed by Sir Thomas Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend again went through the ceremony of shaking hands with\r\nhis reverend brethren, and, on this occasion, did not seem to be\r\nmuch the worse for it. Indeed, in looking at the two men cursorily a\r\nstranger might have said that the condescension was all on the other\r\nside. Mr. M\'Carthy was dressed quite smartly. His black clothes were\r\nspruce and glossy; his gloves, of which he still kept on one and\r\nshowed the other, were quite new; he was clean shaven, and altogether\r\nhe had a shiny, bright, ebon appearance about him that quite did\r\na credit to his side of the church. But our friend the parson was\r\ndiscreditably shabby. His clothes were all brown, his white neck-tie\r\ncould hardly have been clean during the last forty-eight hours, and\r\nwas tied in a knot, which had worked itself nearly round to his ear\r\nas he had sat sideways on the car; his boots were ugly and badly\r\nbrushed, and his hat was very little better than some of those worn\r\nby the workmen--so called--at Ballydahan Hill. But, nevertheless,\r\non looking accurately into the faces of both, one might see which\r\nman was the better nurtured and the better born. That operation\r\nwith the sow\'s ear is, one may say, seldom successful with the first\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n"A beautiful morning, this," said the coadjutor, addressing Herbert\r\nFitzgerald, with a very mild voice and an unutterable look of\r\nfriendship; as though he might have said, "Here we are in a boat\r\ntogether, and of course we are all very fond of each other." To\r\ntell the truth, Father Columb was not a nice-looking young man. He\r\nwas red-haired, slightly marked with the small-pox, and had a low\r\nforehead and cunning eyes.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is, a nice morning," said Herbert. "We don\'t expect anybody\r\nelse here, do we, Somers?"\r\n\r\n"At any rate we won\'t wait," said Somers. So he sat down in the\r\narm-chair, and they all went to work.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid, Mr. Somers," said Mr. M\'Carthy from the other end\r\nof the table, where he had constituted himself a sort of deputy\r\nchairman, "I am afraid we are going on a wrong tack." The priest had\r\nshuffled away his chair as he began to speak, and was now standing\r\nwith his hands upon the table. It is singular how strong a propensity\r\nsome men have to get upon their legs in this way.\r\n\r\n"How so, Mr. M\'Carthy?" said Somers. "But shan\'t we be all more\r\ncomfortable if we keep our chairs? There\'ll be less ceremony, won\'t\r\nthere, Mr. Townsend?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! certainly," said Townsend.\r\n\r\n"Less liable to interruption, perhaps, on our legs," said Father\r\nColumb, smiling blandly.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. M\'Carthy was far too wise to fight the question, so he sat\r\ndown. "Just as you like," said he; "I can talk any way, sitting or\r\nstanding, walking or riding; it\'s all one to me. But I\'ll tell you\r\nhow we are on the wrong tack. We shall never get these men to work in\r\ngangs on the road. Never. They have not been accustomed to be driven\r\nlike droves of sheep."\r\n\r\n"But droves of sheep don\'t work on the road," said Mr. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"I know that, Mr. Townsend," continued Mr. M\'Carthy. "I am quite well\r\naware of that. But droves of sheep are driven, and these men won\'t\r\nbear it."\r\n\r\n"\'Deed an\' they won\'t," said Father Columb, having altogether laid\r\naside his bland smile now that the time had come, as he thought, to\r\nspeak up for the people. "They may bear it in England, but they won\'t\r\nhere." And the sternness of his eye was almost invincible.\r\n\r\n"If they are so foolish, they must be taught better manners," said\r\nMr. Townsend. "But you\'ll find they\'ll work just as other men\r\ndo--look at the navvies."\r\n\r\n"And look at the navvies\' wages," said Father Columb.\r\n\r\n"Besides the navvies only go if they like it," said the parish\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n"And these men need not go unless they like it," said Mr. Somers.\r\n"Only with this proviso, that if they cannot manage for themselves\r\nthey must fall into our way of managing for them."\r\n\r\n"What I say, is this," said Mr. O\'Leary. "Let \'em manage for\r\n\'emselves. God bless my sowl! Why we shall be skinned alive if we\r\nhave to pay all this money back to Government. If Government chooses\r\nto squander thousands in this way, Government should bear the brunt.\r\nThat\'s what I say." Eventually, Government, that is the whole nation,\r\ndid bear the brunt. But it would not have been very wise to promise\r\nthis at the time.\r\n\r\n"But we need hardly debate all that at the present moment," said Mr.\r\nSomers. "That matter of the roads has already been decided for us,\r\nand we can\'t alter it if we would."\r\n\r\n"Then we may as well shut up shop," said Mr. O\'Leary.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all very aisy to talk in that way," said Father Columb; "but\r\nthe Government, as you call it, can\'t make men work. It can\'t force\r\neight millions of the finest pisantry on God\'s earth--," and Father\r\nColumb was, by degrees, pushing away the seat from under him, when he\r\nwas cruelly and ruthlessly stopped by his own parish priest.\r\n\r\n"I beg your pardon for a moment, Creagh," said he; "but perhaps we\r\nare getting a little out of the track. What Mr. Somers says is very\r\ntrue. If these men won\'t work on the road--and I don\'t think they\r\nwill--the responsibility is not on us. That matter has been decided\r\nfor us."\r\n\r\n"Men will sooner work anywhere than starve," said Mr. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"Some men will," said Father Columb, with a great deal of meaning in\r\nhis tone. What he intended to convey was this--that Protestants, no\r\ndoubt, would do so, under the dominion of the flesh; but that Roman\r\nCatholics, being under the dominion of the Spirit, would perish\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n"At any rate we must try," said Father M\'Carthy.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," said Mr. Somers; "and what we have now to do is to see\r\nhow we may best enable these workers to live on their wages, and how\r\nthose others are to live, who, when all is done, will get no wages."\r\n\r\n"I think we had better turn shopkeepers ourselves, and open stores\r\nfor them everywhere," said Herbert. "That is what we are doing\r\nalready at Berryhill."\r\n\r\n"And import our own corn," said the parson.\r\n\r\n"And where are we to get the money?" said the priest.\r\n\r\n"And why are we to ruin the merchants?" said O\'Leary, whose brother\r\nwas in the flour-trade, in Cork.\r\n\r\n"And shut up all the small shopkeepers," said Father Columb,\r\nwhose mother was established in that line in the neighbourhood of\r\nCastleisland.\r\n\r\n"We could not do it," said Somers. "The demand upon us would be so\r\ngreat, that we should certainly break down. And then where would we\r\nbe?"\r\n\r\n"But for a time, Somers," pleaded Herbert.\r\n\r\n"For a time we may do something in that way, till other means present\r\nthemselves. But we must refuse all out-door relief. They who cannot\r\nor do not bring money must go into the workhouses."\r\n\r\n"You will not get houses in county Cork sufficient to hold them,"\r\nsaid Father Bernard. And so the debate went on, not altogether\r\nwithout some sparks of wisdom, with many sparks also of eager\r\nbenevolence, and some few passing clouds of fuliginous self-interest.\r\nAnd then lists were produced, with the names on them of all who\r\nwere supposed to be in want--which were about to become, before\r\nlong, lists of the whole population of the country. And at last\r\nit was decided among them, that in their district nothing should\r\nbe absolutely given away, except to old women and widows,--which\r\nkindhearted clause was speedily neutralised by women becoming widows\r\nwhile their husbands were still living; and it was decided also, that\r\nas long as their money lasted, the soup-kitchen at Berryhill should\r\nbe kept open, and mill kept going, and the little shop maintained, so\r\nthat to some extent a check might be maintained on the prices of the\r\nhucksters. And in this way they got through their work, not perhaps\r\nwith the sagacity of Solomon, but as I have said, with an average\r\namount of wisdom, as will always be the case when men set about their\r\ntasks with true hearts and honest minds.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when they parted, the two clergymen of the parish shook\r\nhands with each other again, having perhaps less animosity against\r\neach other than they had ever felt before. There had been a joke or\r\ntwo over the table, at which both had laughed. The priest had wisely\r\nshown some deference to the parson, and the parson had immediately\r\nreturned it, by referring some question to the priest. How often does\r\nit not happen that when we come across those whom we have hated and\r\navoided all our lives, we find that they are not quite so bad as we\r\nhad thought? That old gentleman of whom we wot is never so black as\r\nhe has been painted.\r\n\r\nThe work of the committee took them nearly the whole day, so that\r\nthey did not separate till it was nearly dark. When they did so,\r\nSomers and Herbert Fitzgerald rode home together.\r\n\r\n"I always live in mortal fear," said Herbert, "that Townsend and the\r\npriests will break out into warfare."\r\n\r\n"As they haven\'t done it yet, they won\'t do it now," said Somers.\r\n"M\'Carthy is not without sense, and Townsend, queer and intolerant as\r\nhe is, has good feeling. If he and Father Columb were left together,\r\nI don\'t know what might happen. Mr. Prendergast is to be with you the\r\nday after to-morrow, is he not?"\r\n\r\n"So I understood my father to say."\r\n\r\n"Will you let me give you a bit of advice, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Then don\'t be in the house much on the day after he comes. He\'ll\r\narrive, probably, to dinner."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he will."\r\n\r\n"If so, leave Castle Richmond after breakfast the next morning, and\r\ndo not return till near dinner-time. It may be that your father will\r\nnot wish you to be near him. Whatever this matter may be, you may be\r\nsure that you will know it before Mr. Prendergast leaves the country.\r\nI am very glad that he is coming."\r\n\r\nHerbert promised that he would take this advice, and he thought\r\nhimself that among other things he might go over to inspect that\r\nClady boiler, and of course call at Desmond Court on his way. And\r\nthen, when they got near to Castle Richmond they parted company, Mr.\r\nSomers stopping at his own place, and Herbert riding home alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day named by Herbert, and only an hour before dinner, Mr.\r\nPrendergast did arrive at Castle Richmond. The Great Southern and\r\nWestern Railway was not then open as far as Mallow, and the journey\r\nfrom Dublin was long and tedious. "I\'ll see him of course," said\r\nSir Thomas to Lady Fitzgerald; "but I\'ll put off this business till\r\nto-morrow." This he said in a tone of distress and agony, which\r\nshowed too plainly how he dreaded the work which he had before him.\r\n"But you\'ll come in to dinner," Lady Fitzgerald had said. "No," he\r\nanswered, "not to-day, love; I have to think about this." And he put\r\nhis hand up to his head, as though this thinking about it had already\r\nbeen too much for him.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast was a man over sixty years of age, being, in fact,\r\nconsiderably senior to Sir Thomas himself. But no one would have\r\ndreamed of calling Mr. Prendergast an old man. He was short of\r\nstature, well made, and in good proportion; he was wiry, strong, and\r\nalmost robust. He walked as though in putting his foot to the earth\r\nhe always wished to proclaim that he was afraid of no man and no\r\nthing. His hair was grizzled, and his whiskers were grey, and round\r\nabout his mouth his face was wrinkled; but with him even these things\r\nhardly seemed to be signs of old age. He was said by many who knew\r\nhim to be a stern man, and there was that in his face which seemed\r\nto warrant such a character. But he had also the reputation of being\r\na very just man; and those who knew him best could tell tales of\r\nhim which proved that his sternness was at any rate compatible with\r\na wide benevolence. He was a man who himself had known but little\r\nmental suffering, and who owned no mental weakness; and it might\r\nbe, therefore, that he was impatient of such weakness in others. To\r\nchance acquaintances his manners were not soft, or perhaps palatable;\r\nbut to his old friends his very brusqueness was pleasing. He was\r\na bachelor, well off in the world, and, to a certain extent, fond\r\nof society. He was a solicitor by profession, having his office\r\nsomewhere in the purlieus of Lincoln\'s Inn, and living in an\r\nold-fashioned house not far distant from that classic spot. I have\r\nsaid that he owned no mental weakness. When I say further that he\r\nwas slightly afflicted with personal vanity, and thought a good deal\r\nabout the set of his hair, the shape of his coat, the fit of his\r\nboots, the whiteness of his hands, and the external trim of his\r\numbrella, perhaps I may be considered to have contradicted myself.\r\nBut such was the case. He was a handsome man too, with clear, bright,\r\ngray eyes, a well-defined nose, and expressive mouth--of which the\r\nlips, however, were somewhat too thin. No man with thin lips ever\r\nseems to me to be genially human at all points.\r\n\r\nSuch was Mr. Prendergast; and my readers will, I trust, feel for Sir\r\nThomas, and pity him, in that he was about to place his wounds in the\r\nhands of so ruthless a surgeon. But a surgeon, to be of use, should\r\nbe ruthless in one sense. He should have the power of cutting and\r\ncauterizing, of phlebotomy and bone-handling without effect on his\r\nown nerves. This power Mr. Prendergast possessed, and therefore it\r\nmay be said that Sir Thomas had chosen his surgeon judiciously. None\r\nof the Castle Richmond family, except Sir Thomas himself, had ever\r\nseen this gentleman, nor had Sir Thomas often come across him of\r\nlate years. But he was what we in England call an old family friend;\r\nand I doubt whether we in England have any more valuable English\r\ncharacteristic than that of having old family friends. Old family\r\nfeuds are not common with us now-a-days--not so common as with some\r\nother people. Sons who now hated their father\'s enemies would have\r\nbut a bad chance before a commission of lunacy; but an old family\r\nfriend is supposed to stick to one from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Castle Richmond he was taken in to Sir Thomas\r\nbefore dinner. "You find me but in a poor state," said Sir Thomas,\r\nshaking in his fear of what was before him, as the poor wretch does\r\nbefore an iron-wristed dentist who is about to operate. "You will\r\nbe better soon," Mr. Prendergast had said, as a man always does say\r\nunder such circumstances. What other remark was possible to him?\r\n"Sir Thomas thinks that he had better not trouble you with business\r\nto-night," said Lady Fitzgerald. To this also Mr. Prendergast\r\nagreed willingly. "We shall both of us be fresher to-morrow, after\r\nbreakfast," he remarked, as if any time made any difference to\r\nhim,--as though he were not always fresh, and ready for any work that\r\nmight turn up.\r\n\r\nThat evening was not passed very pleasantly by the family at Castle\r\nRichmond. To all of them Mr. Prendergast was absolutely a stranger,\r\nand was hardly the man to ingratiate himself with strangers at the\r\nfirst interview. And then, too, they were all somewhat afraid of\r\nhim. He had come down thither on some business which was to them\r\naltogether mysterious, and, as far as they knew, he, and he alone,\r\nwas to be intrusted with the mystery. He of course said nothing to\r\nthem on the subject, but he looked in their eyes as though he were\r\nconscious of being replete with secret importance; and on this very\r\naccount they were afraid of him. And then poor Lady Fitzgerald,\r\nthough she bore up against the weight of her misery better than did\r\nher husband, was herself very wretched. She could not bring herself\r\nto believe that all this would end in nothing; that Mr. Prendergast\r\nwould put everything right, and that after his departure they would\r\ngo on as happily as ever. This was the doctrine of the younger part\r\nof the family, who would not think that anything was radically wrong.\r\nBut Lady Fitzgerald had always at her heart the memory of her early\r\nmarriage troubles, and she feared greatly, though she feared she knew\r\nnot what.\r\n\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald and Aunt Letty did endeavour to keep up some\r\nconversation with Mr. Prendergast; and the Irish famine was,\r\nof course, the subject. But this did not go on pleasantly. Mr.\r\nPrendergast was desirous of information; but the statements which\r\nwere made to him one moment by young Fitzgerald were contradicted in\r\nthe next by his aunt. He would declare that the better educated of\r\nthe Roman Catholics were prepared to do their duty by their country,\r\nwhereas Aunt Letty would consider herself bound both by party feeling\r\nand religious duty, to prove that the Roman Catholics were bad in\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Herbert, to hear you say so!" she exclaimed at one time, "it\r\nmakes me tremble in my shoes. It is dreadful to think that those\r\npeople should have got such a hold over you."\r\n\r\n"I really think that the Roman Catholic priests are liberal in their\r\nideas and moral in their conduct." This was the speech which had made\r\nAunt Letty tremble in her shoes, and it may, therefore, be conceived\r\nthat Mr. Prendergast did not find himself able to form any firm\r\nopinion from the statements then made to him. Instead of doing so, he\r\nset them both down as "Wild Irish," whom it would be insane to trust,\r\nand of whom it was absurd to make inquiries. It may, however, be\r\npossibly the case that Mr. Prendergast himself had his own prejudices\r\nas well as Aunt Letty and Herbert Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning they were still more mute at breakfast. The\r\ntime was coming in which Mr. Prendergast was to go to work, and even\r\nhe, gifted though he was with iron nerves, began to feel somewhat\r\nunpleasantly the nature of the task which he had undertaken. Lady\r\nFitzgerald did not appear at all. Indeed, during the whole of\r\nbreakfast-time and up to the moment at which Mr. Prendergast was\r\nsummoned, she was sitting with her husband, holding his hand in hers,\r\nand looking tenderly but painfully into his face. She so sat with him\r\nfor above an hour, but he spoke to her no word of this revelation he\r\nwas about to make. Herbert and the girls, and even Aunt Letty, sat\r\nsolemn and silent, as though it was known by them all that something\r\ndreadful was to be said and done. At last Herbert, who had left the\r\nroom, returned to it. "My father will see you now, Mr. Prendergast,\r\nif you will step up to him," said he; and then he ran to his mother\r\nand told her that he should leave the house till dinner-time.\r\n\r\n"But if he sends for you, Herbert, should you not be in the way?"\r\n\r\n"It is more likely that he should send for you; and, were I to remain\r\nhere, I should be going into his room when he did not want me." And\r\nthen he mounted his horse and rode off.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast, with serious air and slow steps, and solemn resolve\r\nto do what he had to do at any rate with justice, walked away from\r\nthe dining-room to the baronet\'s study. The task of an old friend\r\nis not always a pleasant one, and Mr. Prendergast felt that it was\r\nnot so at the present moment. "Be gentle with him," said Aunt Letty,\r\ncatching hold of his arm as he went through the passage. He merely\r\nmoved his head twice, in token of assent, and then passed on into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe reader will have learnt by this time, with tolerable accuracy,\r\nwhat was the nature of the revelation which Sir Thomas was called\r\nupon to make, and he will be tolerably certain as to the advice which\r\nMr. Prendergast, as an honest man, would give. In that respect there\r\nwas no difficulty. The laws of meum and tuum are sufficiently clear\r\nif a man will open his eyes to look at them. In this case they were\r\naltogether clear. These broad acres of Castle Richmond did belong to\r\nSir Thomas--for his life. But after his death they could not belong\r\nto his son Herbert. It was a matter which admitted of no doubt. No\r\nquestion as to whether the Molletts would or would not hold their\r\ntongue could bear upon it in the least. Justice in this case must be\r\ndone, even though the heavens should fall. It was sad and piteous.\r\nStern and hard as was the man who pronounced this doom, nevertheless\r\nthe salt tear collected in his eyes and blinded him as he looked upon\r\nthe anguish which his judgment had occasioned.\r\n\r\nYes, Herbert must be told that he in the world was nobody; that he\r\nmust earn his bread, and set about doing so right soon. Who could say\r\nthat his father\'s life was worth a twelvemonth\'s purchase? He must\r\nbe told that he was nobody in the world, and instructed also to tell\r\nher whom he loved, an Earl\'s daughter, the same tidings; that he was\r\nnobody, that he would come to possess no property, and that in the\r\nlaw\'s eyes did not possess even a name. How would his young heart\r\nsuffice for the endurance of so terrible a calamity? And those\r\npretty girls, so softly brought up--so tenderly nurtured; it must\r\nbe explained to them too that they must no longer be proud of their\r\nfather\'s lineage and their mother\'s fame. And that other Fitzgerald\r\nmust be summoned and told of all this; he on whom they had looked\r\ndown, whom the young heir had robbed of his love, whom they had cast\r\nout from among them as unworthy. Notice must be sent to him that he\r\nwas the heir to Castle Richmond, that he would reign as the future\r\nbaronet in those gracious chambers. It was he who could now make a\r\ngreat county lady of the daughter of the countess.\r\n\r\n"It will be very soon, very soon," sobbed forth the poor victim. And\r\nindeed, to look at him one might say that it would be soon. There\r\nwere moments when Mr. Prendergast hardly thought that he would live\r\nthrough that frightful day.\r\n\r\nBut all of which we have yet spoken hardly operated upon the\r\nbaronet\'s mind in creating that stupor of sorrow which now weighed\r\nhim to the earth. It was none of these things that utterly broke him\r\ndown and crushed him like a mangled reed. He had hardly mind left\r\nto remember his children. It was for the wife of his bosom that he\r\nsorrowed.\r\n\r\nThe wife of his bosom! He persisted in so calling her through the\r\nwhole interview, and, even in his weakness, obliged the strong man\r\nbefore him so to name her also. She was his wife before God, and\r\nshould be his to the end. Ah! for how short a time was that! "Is she\r\nto leave me?" he once said, turning to his friend, with his hands\r\nclasped together, praying that some mercy might be shown to his\r\nwretchedness. "Is she to leave me?" he repeated, and then sank on his\r\nknees upon the floor.\r\n\r\nAnd how was Mr. Prendergast to answer this question? How was he to\r\ndecide whether or no this man and woman might still live together\r\nas husband and wife? Oh, my reader, think of it if you can, and put\r\nyourself for a moment in the place of that old family friend! "Tell\r\nme, tell me; is she to leave me?" repeated the poor victim of all\r\nthis misery.\r\n\r\nThe sternness and justice of the man at last gave way. "No," said\r\nhe, "that cannot, I should think, be necessary. They cannot demand\r\nthat." "But you won\'t desert me?" said Sir Thomas, when this crumb\r\nof comfort was handed to him. And he remembered as he spoke, the\r\nbloodshot eyes of the miscreant who had dared to tell him that the\r\nwife of his bosom might be legally torn from him by the hands of\r\nanother man. "You won\'t desert me?" said Sir Thomas; meaning by that,\r\nto bind his friend to an obligation that, at any rate, his wife\r\nshould not be taken from him.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Prendergast, "I will not desert you; certainly not\r\nthat; certainly not that." Just then it was in his heart to promise\r\nalmost anything that he was asked. Who could have refused such solace\r\nas this to a man so terribly overburthened?\r\n\r\nBut there was another point of view at which Mr. Prendergast had\r\nlooked from the commencement, but at which he could not get Sir\r\nThomas to look at all. It certainly was necessary that the whole\r\ntruth in this matter should be made known and declared openly. This\r\nfair inheritance must go to the right owner and not to the wrong.\r\nThough the affliction on Sir Thomas was very heavy, and would be\r\nequally so on all the family, he would not on that account, for the\r\nsake of saving him and them from that affliction, be justified in\r\nrobbing another person of what was legally and actually that other\r\nperson\'s property. It was a matter of astonishment to Mr. Prendergast\r\nthat a conscientious man, as Sir Thomas certainly was, should have\r\nbeen able to look at the matter in any other light; that he should\r\never have brought himself to have dealings in the matter with Mr.\r\nMollett. Justice in the case was clear, and the truth must be\r\ndeclared. But then they must take good care to find out absolutely\r\nwhat the truth was. Having heard all that Sir Thomas had to say,\r\nand having sifted all that he did hear, Mr. Prendergast thoroughly\r\nbelieved, in his heart of hearts, that that wretched miscreant was\r\nthe actual and true husband of the poor lady whom he would have to\r\nsee. But it was necessary that this should be proved. Castle Richmond\r\nfor the family, and all earthly peace of mind for that unfortunate\r\nlady and gentleman were not to be given up on the bare word of a\r\nscheming scoundrel, for whom no crime would be too black, and no\r\ncruelty too monstrous. The proofs must be looked into before anything\r\nwas done, and they must be looked into before anything was said--to\r\nLady Fitzgerald. We surely may give her that name as yet.\r\n\r\nBut then, how were they to get at the proofs--at the proofs one way\r\nor the other? That Mollett himself had his marriage certificate Sir\r\nThomas declared. That evidence had been brought home to his own\r\nmind of the identity of the man--though what was the nature of that\r\nevidence he could not now describe--as to that he was quite explicit.\r\nIndeed, as I have said above, he almost refused to consider the\r\nquestion as admitting of a doubt. That Mollett was the man to whom\r\nhis wife had been married he thoroughly believed; and, to tell the\r\ntruth, Mr. Prendergast was afraid to urge him to look for much\r\ncomfort in this direction. The whole manner of the man, Mollett, had\r\nbeen such as to show that he himself was sure of his ground. Mr.\r\nPrendergast could hardly doubt that he was the man, although he\r\nfelt himself bound to remark that nothing should be said to Lady\r\nFitzgerald till inquiry had been made. Mr. Mollett himself would be\r\nat Castle Richmond on the next day but one, in accordance with the\r\nappointment made by himself; and, if necessary, he could be kept in\r\ncustody till he had been identified as being the man, or as not being\r\nthe man, who had married Miss Wainwright.\r\n\r\n"There is nobody living with you now who knew Lady Fitzgerald at--?"\r\nasked Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Sir Thomas, "there is one maid servant." And then he\r\nexplained how Mrs. Jones had lived with his wife before her first\r\nmarriage, during those few months in which she had been called Mrs.\r\nTalbot, and from that day even up to the present hour.\r\n\r\n"Then she must have known this man," said Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Thomas was not in a frame of mind at all suited to the\r\nsifting of evidence. He did not care to say anything about Mrs.\r\nJones; he got no crumb of comfort out of that view of the matter.\r\nThings had come out, unwittingly for the most part, in his\r\nconversations with Mollett, which made him quite certain as to\r\nthe truth of the main part of the story. All those Dorsetshire\r\nlocalities were well known to the man, the bearings of the house,\r\nthe circumstances of Mr. Wainwright\'s parsonage, the whole history\r\nof those months; so that on this subject Sir Thomas had no doubt;\r\nand we may as well know at once that there was no room for doubt.\r\nOur friend of the Kanturk Hotel, South Main Street, Cork, was the\r\nman who, thirty years before, had married the child-daughter of the\r\nDorsetshire parson.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast, however, stood awhile before the fire balancing\r\nthe evidence. "The woman must have known him," he said to himself,\r\n"and surely she could tell us whether he be like the man. And Lady\r\nFitzgerald herself would know; but then who would have the hardness\r\nof heart to ask Lady Fitzgerald to confront that man?"\r\n\r\nHe remained with Sir Thomas that day for hours. The long winter\r\nevening had begun to make itself felt by its increasing gloom before\r\nhe left him. Wine and biscuits were sent in to them, but neither\r\nof them even noticed the man who brought them. Twice in the day,\r\nhowever, Mr. Prendergast gave the baronet a glass of sherry, which\r\nthe latter swallowed unconsciously; and then, at about four, the\r\nlawyer prepared to take his leave. "I will see you early to-morrow,"\r\nsaid he, "immediately after breakfast."\r\n\r\n"You are going then?" said Sir Thomas, who greatly dreaded being left\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n"Not away, you know," said Mr. Prendergast. "I am not going to leave\r\nthe house."\r\n\r\n"No," said Sir Thomas; "no, of course not, but--" and then he paused.\r\n\r\n"Eh!" said Mr. Prendergast, "you were saying something."\r\n\r\n"They will be coming in to me now," said Sir Thomas, wailing like a\r\nchild; "now, when you are gone; and what am I to say to them?"\r\n\r\n"I would say nothing at present; nothing to-day."\r\n\r\n"And my wife?" he asked, again. Through this interview he studiously\r\ncalled her his wife. "Is--is she to know it?"\r\n\r\n"When we are assured that this man\'s story is true, Sir Thomas, she\r\nmust know it. That will probably be very soon,--in a day or two. Till\r\nthen I think you had better tell her nothing."\r\n\r\n"And what shall I say to her?"\r\n\r\n"Say nothing. I think it probable that she will not ask any\r\nquestions. If she does, tell her that the business between you and me\r\nis not yet over. I will tell your son that at present he had better\r\nnot speak to you on the subject of my visit here." And then he again\r\ntook the hand of the unfortunate gentleman, and having pressed it\r\nwith more tenderness than seemed to belong to him, he left the room.\r\n\r\nHe left the room, and hurried into the hall and out of the house; but\r\nas he did so he could see that he was watched by Lady Fitzgerald. She\r\nwas on the alert to go to her husband as soon as she should know that\r\nhe was alone. Of what then took place between those two we need say\r\nnothing, but will wander forth for a while with Mr. Prendergast into\r\nthe wide-spreading park.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast had been used to hard work all his life, but he had\r\nnever undergone a day of severer toil than that through which he had\r\njust past. Nor was it yet over. He had laid it down in a broad way as\r\nhis opinion that the whole truth in this matter should be declared\r\nto the world, let the consequences be what they might; and to this\r\nopinion Sir Thomas had acceded without a word of expostulation. But\r\nin this was by no means included all that portion of the burden which\r\nnow fell upon Mr. Prendergast\'s shoulders. It would be for him to\r\nlook into the evidence, and then it would be for him also--heavy and\r\nworst task of all--to break the matter to Lady Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nAs he sauntered out into the park, to wander about for half an hour\r\nin the dusk of the evening, his head was throbbing with pain. The\r\nfamily friend in this instance had certainly been severely taxed in\r\nthe exercise of his friendship. And what was he to do next? How was\r\nhe to conduct himself that evening in the family circle, knowing, as\r\nhe so well did, that his coming there was to bring destruction upon\r\nthem all? "Be tender to him," Aunt Letty had said, little knowing\r\nhow great a call there would be on his tenderness of heart, and how\r\nlittle scope for any tenderness of purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd was it absolutely necessary that that blow should fall in all its\r\nseverity? He asked himself this question over and over again, and\r\nalways had to acknowledge that it was necessary. There could be no\r\npossible mitigation. The son must be told that he was no son--no son\r\nin the eye of the law; the wife must be told that she was no wife,\r\nand the distant relative must be made acquainted with his golden\r\nprospects. The position of Herbert and Clara, and of their promised\r\nmarriage, had been explained to him,--and all that too must be\r\nshivered into fragments. How was it possible that the penniless\r\ndaughter of an earl should give herself in marriage to a youth,\r\nwho was not only penniless also, but illegitimate and without a\r\nprofession? Look at it in which way he would, it was all misery and\r\nruin, and it had fallen upon him to pronounce the doom!\r\n\r\nHe could not himself believe that there was any doubt as to the\r\ngeneral truth of Mollett\'s statement. He would of course inquire. He\r\nwould hear what the man had to say and see what he had to adduce.\r\nHe would also examine that old servant, and, if necessary--and if\r\npossible also--he would induce Lady Fitzgerald to see the man. But he\r\ndid feel convinced that on this point there was no doubt. And then\r\nhe lifted up his hands in astonishment at the folly which had been\r\ncommitted by a marriage under such circumstances--as wise men will\r\ndo in the decline of years, when young people in the heyday of youth\r\nhave not been wise. "If they had waited for a term of years," he\r\nsaid, "and if he then had not presented himself!" A term of years,\r\nsuch as Jacob served for Rachel, seems so light an affair to old\r\nbachelors looking back at the loves of their young friends.\r\n\r\nAnd so he walked about in the dusk by no means a happy man, nor in\r\nany way satisfied with the work which was still before him. How was\r\nhe to face Lady Fitzgerald, or tell her of her fate? In what words\r\nmust he describe to Herbert Fitzgerald the position which in future\r\nhe must fill? The past had been dreadful to him, and the future would\r\nbe no less so, in spite of his character as a hard, stern man.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the house he met young Fitzgerald in the hall.\r\n"Have you been to your father?" he asked immediately. Herbert, in a\r\nlow voice, and with a saddened face, said that he had just come from\r\nhis father\'s room; but Mr. Prendergast at once knew that nothing of\r\nthe truth had been told to him. "You found him very weak," said Mr.\r\nPrendergast. "Oh, very weak," said Herbert. "More than weak, utterly\r\nprostrate. He was lying on the sofa almost unable to speak. My mother\r\nwas with him and is still there."\r\n\r\n"And she?" He was painfully anxious to know whether Sir Thomas had\r\nbeen weak enough--or strong enough--to tell his wife any of the story\r\nwhich that morning had been told to him.\r\n\r\n"She is doing what she can to comfort him," said Herbert; "but it is\r\nvery hard for her to be left so utterly in the dark."\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast was passing on to his room, but at the foot of the\r\nstairs Herbert stopped him again, going up the stairs with him, and\r\nalmost whispering into his ear--\r\n\r\n"I trust, Mr. Prendergast," said he, "that things are not to go on in\r\nthis way."\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\n"Because it is unbearable--unbearable for my mother and for me, and\r\nfor us all. My mother thinks that some terrible thing has happened to\r\nthe property; but if so, why should I not be told?"\r\n\r\n"Of anything that really has happened, or does happen, you will be\r\ntold."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether you are aware of it, Mr. Prendergast, but I am\r\nengaged to be married. And I have been given to understand--that is,\r\nI thought that this might take place very soon. My mother seems to\r\nthink that your coming here may--may defer it. If so, I think I have\r\na right to expect that something shall be told to me."\r\n\r\n"Certainly you have a right, my dear young friend. But Mr.\r\nFitzgerald, for your own sake, for all our sakes, wait patiently for\r\na few hours."\r\n\r\n"I have waited patiently."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know it. You have behaved admirably. But I cannot speak\r\nto you now. This time the day after to-morrow, I will tell you\r\neverything that I know. But do not speak of this to your mother.\r\nI make this promise only to you." And then he passed on into his\r\nbed-room.\r\n\r\nWith this Herbert was obliged to be content. That evening he again\r\nsaw his father and mother, but he told them nothing of what had\r\npassed between him and Mr. Prendergast. Lady Fitzgerald remained in\r\nthe study with Sir Thomas the whole evening, nay, almost the whole\r\nnight, and the slow hours as they passed there were very dreadful.\r\nNo one came to table but Aunt Letty, Mr. Prendergast, and Herbert,\r\nand between them hardly a word was spoken. The poor girls had found\r\nthemselves utterly unable to appear. They were dissolved in tears,\r\nand crouching over the fire in their own room. And the moment\r\nthat Aunt Letty left the table Mr. Prendergast arose also. He was\r\nsuffering, he said, cruelly from headache, and would ask permission\r\nto go to his chamber. It would have been impossible for him to have\r\nsat there pretending to sip his wine with Herbert Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nAfter this Herbert again went to his father, and then, in the\r\ngloom of the evening, he found Mr. Somers in the office, a little\r\nmagistrate\'s room, that was used both by him and by Sir Thomas. But\r\nnothing passed between them. Herbert had nothing to tell. And then at\r\nabout nine he also went up to his bedroom. A more melancholy day than\r\nthat had never shed its gloom upon Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTWO WITNESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast had given himself two days to do all that was to\r\nbe done, before he told Herbert Fitzgerald the whole of the family\r\nhistory. He had promised that he would then let him know all that\r\nthere was to be known; and he had done so advisedly, considering\r\nthat it would be manifestly unjust to leave him in the dark an hour\r\nlonger than was absolutely necessary. To expect that Sir Thomas\r\nhimself should, with his own breath and his own words, make the\r\nrevelation either to his son or to his wife, was to expect a manifest\r\nimpossibility. He would, altogether, have sank under such an\r\neffort, as he had already sank under the effort of telling it to Mr.\r\nPrendergast; nor could it be left to the judgment of Sir Thomas to\r\nsay when the story should be told. He had now absolutely abandoned\r\nall judgment in the matter. He had placed himself in the hands of a\r\nfriend, and he now expected that that friend should do all that there\r\nwas to be done. Mr. Prendergast had therefore felt himself justified\r\nin making this promise.\r\n\r\nBut how was he to set about the necessary intervening work, and how\r\npass the intervening hours? It had already been decided that Mr.\r\nAbraham Mollett, when he called, should be shown, as usual, into the\r\nstudy, but that he should there find himself confronted, not with Sir\r\nThomas, but with Mr. Prendergast. But there was some doubt whether\r\nor no Mr. Mollett would come. It might be that he had means of\r\nascertaining what strangers arrived at Castle Richmond; and it\r\nmight be, that he would, under the present circumstances, think it\r\nexpedient to stay away. This visit, however, was not to take place\r\ntill the second day after that on which Mr. Prendergast had heard the\r\nstory; and, in the meantime, he had that examination of Mrs. Jones to\r\narrange and conduct.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was again very sad. The girls suggested to their\r\nbrother that he and Mr. Prendergast should sit together by themselves\r\nin a small breakfast parlour, but to this he would not assent.\r\nNothing could be more difficult or embarrassing than a conversation\r\nbetween himself and that gentleman, and he moreover was unwilling to\r\nlet it be thought in the household that affairs were going utterly\r\nwrong in the family. On this matter he need hardly have disturbed\r\nhimself, for the household was fully convinced that things were\r\ngoing very wrong. Maid-servants and men-servants can read the\r\nmeaning of heavy brows and sad faces, of long meetings and whispered\r\nconsultations, as well as their betters. The two girls, therefore,\r\nand Aunt Letty, appeared at the breakfast-table, but it was as though\r\nso many ghosts had assembled round the urn.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast, Mr. Prendergast applied to Aunt Letty.\r\n"Miss Fitzgerald," said he, "I think you have an old servant of the\r\nname of Jones living here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sure," said Aunt Letty. "She was living with my sister-in-law\r\nbefore her marriage."\r\n\r\n"Exactly,--and ever since too, I believe," said Mr. Prendergast,\r\nwith a lawyer\'s instinctive desire to divert suspicion from the true\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, always; Mrs. Jones is quite one of ourselves."\r\n\r\n"Then would you do me the favour to beg Mrs. Jones to oblige me with\r\nher company for half an hour or so. There is an excellent fire in my\r\nroom, and perhaps Mrs. Jones would not object to step there."\r\n\r\nAunt Letty promised that Mrs. Jones should be sent, merely suggesting\r\nthe breakfast-parlour, instead of the bed-room; and to the\r\nbreakfast-parlour Mr. Prendergast at once betook himself. "What can\r\nshe know about the London property, or about the Irish property?"\r\nthought Aunt Letty, to herself; and then it occurred to her that,\r\nperhaps, all these troubles arose from some source altogether\r\ndistinct from the property.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour, a knock came to the breakfast-parlour\r\ndoor, and Mrs. Jones, having been duly summoned, entered the room\r\nwith a very clean cap and apron, and with a very low curtsey. "Good\r\nmorning, Mrs. Jones," said Mr. Prendergast; "pray take a seat;" and\r\nhe pointed to an arm-chair that was comfortably placed near the fire,\r\non the further side of the hearth-rug. Mrs. Jones sat herself down,\r\ncrossed her hands on her lap, and looked the very personification of\r\nmeek obedience.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there was something about her which seemed to justify the\r\nsoubriquet of duchess, which the girls had given to her. She had a\r\ncertain grandeur about her cap, and a majestical set about the skirt\r\nof her dress, and a rigour in the lines of her mouth, which indicated\r\na habit of command, and a confidence in her own dignity, which might\r\nbe supposed to be the very clearest attribute of duchessdom.\r\n\r\n"You have been in this family a long time, I am told, Mrs. Jones,"\r\nsaid Mr. Prendergast, using his pleasantest voice.\r\n\r\n"A very long time indeed," said Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n"And in a very confidential situation, too. I am told by Sir Thomas\r\nthat pretty nearly the whole management of the house is left in your\r\nhands?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Thomas is very kind, sir; Sir Thomas always was very kind,--poor\r\ngentleman!"\r\n\r\n"Poor gentleman, indeed! you may well say that, Mrs. Jones. This\r\nfamily is in great affliction; you are no doubt aware of that." And\r\nMr. Prendergast as he spoke got up, went to the door, and saw that it\r\nwas firmly closed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones acknowledged that she was aware of it. "It was\r\nimpossible," she said, "for servants to shut their eyes to things, if\r\nthey tried ever so."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course," said Mr. Prendergast; "and particularly for a\r\nperson so attached to them all as you are."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Pendrergrass, I am attached to them, certainly. I have\r\nseed \'em all born, sir--that is, the young ladies and Mr. Herbert.\r\nAnd as for her ladyship, I didn\'t see her born, in course, for we\'re\r\nboth of an age. But it comes much to the same thing, like."\r\n\r\n"Exactly, exactly; you are quite one of themselves, as Sir Thomas\'s\r\nsister said to me just now. \'Mrs. Jones is quite one of ourselves.\'\r\nThose were her very words."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I\'m much obliged to Miss Letty."\r\n\r\n"Well, as I was saying, a great sorrow has come upon them all, Mrs.\r\nJones. Now will you tell me this--do you know what it is? Can you\r\nguess at all? Do the servants know, down stairs?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather not be guessing on any such matters, Mr. Pendrergrass.\r\nAnd as for them, if they were impudent enough for the like, they\'d\r\nnever dare to tell me. Them Irish servants is very impudent betimes,\r\nonly they\'re good at the heart too, and there isn\'t one\'d hurt a dog\r\nbelonging to the family."\r\n\r\n"I am sure they would not," said Mr. Prendergast. "But you yourself,\r\nyou don\'t know what this trouble is?"\r\n\r\n"Not a know," said Mrs. Jones, looking down and smoothing her apron.\r\n\r\n"Well, now. Of course you understand, Mrs. Jones--and I must explain\r\nthis to you to account for my questions. Of course you understand\r\nthat I am here as Sir Thomas\'s friend, to set certain matters right\r\nfor him if I can."\r\n\r\n"I supposed as much as that, if you please, sir."\r\n\r\n"And any questions that I may ask you, I ask altogether on his\r\nbehalf--on his behalf and on that of his wife, Lady Fitzgerald. I\r\ntell you, that you may have no scruples as to answering me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, I have no scruples as to that. But of course, sir, in\r\nanything I say I must be guided by--by--"\r\n\r\n"By your own judgment you were going to say."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; begging pardon for mentioning such a thing to the likes of\r\nyou, sir."\r\n\r\n"Quite right; quite right. Everybody should use their own judgment in\r\neverything they do or say, more or less. But now, Mrs. Jones, I want\r\nto know this: you remember her ladyship\'s first marriage, I dare\r\nsay."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I remember it," said Mrs. Jones, shaking her head.\r\n\r\n"It was a sad affair, wasn\'t it? I remember it well, though I was\r\nvery young then. So were you too, Mrs. Jones."\r\n\r\n"Young enough, surely, sir; and foolish enough too. We were the most\r\nof us that, then, sir."\r\n\r\n"True, true; so we were. But you remember the man, don\'t you--her\r\nladyship\'s husband? Mr. Talbot, he called himself." And Mr.\r\nPrendergast took some trouble to look as though he did not at all\r\nwish to frighten her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do remember him." This she said after a considerable pause.\r\n"But it is a very long time ago, you know, Mr. Pendrergrass."\r\n\r\n"A very long time. But I am sure you do remember. You lived in the\r\nhouse, you know, for some months."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did. He was my master for three months, or thereabouts; and\r\nto tell the truth, I never got my wages for those three months yet.\r\nBut that\'s neither here nor there."\r\n\r\n"Do you believe now, Mrs. Jones, that that Mr. Talbot is still\r\nalive?" He asked the question in a very soft voice, and endeavoured\r\nnot to startle her by his look as he did so. But it was necessary to\r\nhis purpose that he should keep his eye upon her. Half the answer to\r\nhis question was to be conveyed by the effect on the muscles of her\r\nface which that question would produce. She might perhaps command\r\nher voice to tell a falsehood, but be unable to command her face to\r\nsupport it.\r\n\r\n"Believe what, sir?" said she, and the lawyer could immediately\r\nperceive that she did believe and probably knew that that man who had\r\ncalled himself Talbot was still alive.\r\n\r\n"Do you believe, Mrs. Jones, that he is alive--her ladyship\'s former\r\nhusband, you know?"\r\n\r\nThe question was so terrible in its nature, that Mrs. Jones\r\nabsolutely shook under it. Did she think that that man was still\r\nalive? Why, if she thought that what was she to think of her\r\nladyship? It was in that manner that she would have answered the\r\nquestion, had she known how; but she did not know; she had therefore\r\nto look about her for some other words which might be equally\r\nevasive. Those which she selected served her turn just as well. "Lord\r\nbless you, sir!" she said. It was not that the words were expressive,\r\nbut the tone was decidedly so. It was as though she said, "How can\r\nthat man be alive, who has been dead these twenty years and more?"\r\nBut nevertheless, she was giving evidence all the time against the\r\ncause of her poor mistress.\r\n\r\n"You think, then, that he is dead?"\r\n\r\n"Dead, sir! Oh, laws! why shouldn\'t he be dead?" And then there was a\r\npause between them for a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Jones," said Mr. Prendergast, when he had well considered the\r\nmatter, "my belief is that your only object and wish is to do good to\r\nyour master and mistress."\r\n\r\n"Surely, sir, surely; it would be my bounden duty to do them good, if\r\nI knew how."\r\n\r\n"I will tell you how. Speak out to me the whole truth openly and\r\nfreely. I am here as the friend of Sir Thomas and of her ladyship. He\r\nhas sent to me that I may advise him what to do in a great trouble\r\nthat has befallen him, and I cannot give him good advice till I know\r\nthe truth."\r\n\r\n"What good could it do him, poor gentleman, to know that that man is\r\nalive?"\r\n\r\n"It will do him good to know the truth; to know whether he be alive\r\nor no. Until he knows that he cannot act properly."\r\n\r\n"Poor gentleman! poor gentleman!" said Mrs. Jones, putting her\r\nhandkerchief up to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"If you have any information in this matter--and I think you have,\r\nMrs. Jones--or even any suspicion, it is your duty to tell me."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I\'m sure I don\'t say against that. You are Sir Thomas\'s\r\nfriend to be sure, and no doubt you know best. And I\'m a poor\r\nignorant woman. But to speak candidly, sir, I don\'t feel myself free\r\nto talk on this matter. I haven\'t never made nor marred since I\'ve\r\nbeen in this family, not in such matters as them. What I\'ve seed,\r\nI\'ve kep\' to myself, and when I\'ve had my suspecs, as a woman\r\ncan\'t but have \'em, I\'ve kep\' them to myself also. And saving your\r\npresence, sir, and meaning no offence to a gentleman like you," and\r\nhere she got up from her chair and made another curtsey, "I think\r\nI\'d liefer hold my tongue than say anything more on this matter."\r\nAnd then she remained standing as though she expected permission to\r\nretire.\r\n\r\nBut there was still another pause, and Mr. Prendergast sat looking at\r\nthe fire. "Don\'t you know, ma\'am," at last he said, with almost an\r\nangry voice, "that the man was here, in this house, last week?" And\r\nnow he turned round at her and looked her full in the face. He did\r\nnot, however, know Mrs. Jones. It might be difficult to coax her\r\ninto free communication, but it was altogether out of his power to\r\nfrighten her into it.\r\n\r\n"What I knows, sir, I knows," said she, "and what I don\'t know, I\r\ndon\'t know. And if you please, sir, Lady Fitzgerald--she\'s my missus;\r\nand if I\'m to be said anything more to about this here matter, why,\r\nI\'d choose that her ladyship should be by." And then she made a\r\nlittle motion as though to walk towards the door, but Mr. Prendergast\r\nmanaged to stop her.\r\n\r\n"But we want to spare Lady Fitzgerald, if we can--at any rate for a\r\nwhile," said he. "You would not wish to bring more sorrow upon her,\r\nwould you?"\r\n\r\n"God forbid, Mr. Pendrergrass; and if I could take the sorrow from\r\nher heart, I would willingly, and bear it myself to the grave; for\r\nher ladyship has been a good lady to me. But no good never did come,\r\nand never will, of servants talking of their missusses. And so if you\r\nplease, sir, I\'ll make bold to"--and again she made an attempt to\r\nreach the door.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Prendergast was not yet persuaded that he could not get\r\nfrom the good old woman the information that he wanted, and he was\r\npersuaded that she had the information if only she could be prevailed\r\nupon to impart it. So he again stopped her, though on this occasion\r\nshe made some slight attempt to pass him by as she did so. "I don\'t\r\nthink," said she, "that there will be much use in my staying here\r\nlonger."\r\n\r\n"Wait half a minute, Mrs. Jones, just half a minute. If I could only\r\nmake you understand how we are all circumstanced here. And I tell you\r\nwhat; though you will trust me with nothing, I will trust you with\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want no trust, sir; not about all this."\r\n\r\n"But listen to me. Sir Thomas has reason to believe--nay, he feels\r\nquite sure--that this man is alive."\r\n\r\n"Poor gentleman! poor gentleman!"\r\n\r\n"And has been here in this house two or three times within the last\r\nmonth. Sir Thomas is full sure of this. Now can you tell me whether\r\nthe man who did come was this Talbot, or was not? If you can answer\r\nthat positively, either one way or the other, you will do a service\r\nto the whole family,--which shall not go unrewarded."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want no reward, sir. Ask me to tattle of them for rewards,\r\nafter thirty years!" And she put her apron up to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, for the good of the family. Can you say positively that\r\nthe man who came here to your master was Talbot, or that he was not?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed then, sir, I can\'t say anything positively, nor for that\r\nmatter, not impositively either." And then she shut herself up\r\ndoggedly, and sat with compressed lips, determined to resist all the\r\nlawyer\'s arts.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast did not immediately give up the game, but he failed\r\nin learning from her any more than what she had already told him. He\r\nfelt confident that she did know the secret of this man\'s existence\r\nand presence in the south of Ireland, but he was forced to satisfy\r\nhimself with that conviction. So he let her go, giving her his hand\r\nas she went in token of respect, and receiving her demure curtsey\r\nwith his kindest smile. "It may be," thought he to himself, "that I\r\nhave not done with her yet."\r\n\r\nAnd then he passed another tedious day,--a day that was terribly\r\ntedious to them all. He paid a visit to Sir Thomas; but as that\r\narrangement about Mollett\'s visit had been made between them, it was\r\nnot necessary that anything should be done or said about the business\r\non hand. It was understood that further action was to be stayed till\r\nthat visit was over, and therefore for the present he had nothing\r\nto say to Sir Thomas. He did not see Lady Fitzgerald throughout\r\nthe whole day, and it appeared to him, not unnaturally, that she\r\npurposely kept out of his way, anticipating evil from his coming. He\r\ntook a walk with Herbert and Mr. Somers, and was driven as far as\r\nthe soup-kitchen and mill at Berry Hill, inquiring into the state of\r\nthe poor, or rather pretending to inquire. It was a pretence with\r\nthem all, for at the present moment their minds were intent on other\r\nthings. And then there was that terrible dinner, that mockery of a\r\nmeal, at which the three ladies were constrained to appear, but at\r\nwhich they found it impossible to eat or to speak. Mr. Somers had\r\nbeen asked to join the party, so that the scene after dinner might\r\nbe less painful; but even he felt that he could not talk as was his\r\nordinary wont. Horrible suspicions of the truth had gradually come\r\nupon him; and with a suspicion of such a truth--of such a tragedy\r\nin the very household--how could he, or how could any one hold a\r\nconversation? and then at about half-past nine, Mr. Prendergast was\r\nagain in his bed-room.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning he was early with Sir Thomas, persuading him to\r\nrelinquish altogether the use of his study for that day. On that\r\nevening they were to have another interview there, in which Mr.\r\nPrendergast was to tell his friend the result of what had been done.\r\nAnd then he had to arrange certain manoeuvring with the servants in\r\nwhich he was forced to obtain the assistance of Herbert. Mollett\r\nwas to be introduced into the study immediately on his arrival, and\r\nthis was to be done in such a manner that Mrs. Jones might assuredly\r\nbe ignorant of his arrival. On this duty our old friend Richard\r\nwas employed, and it was contrived that Mrs. Jones should be kept\r\nupstairs with her mistress. All this was difficult enough, but he\r\ncould not explain even to Herbert the reason why such scheming\r\nwas necessary. Herbert, however, obeyed in silence, knowing that\r\nsomething dreadful was about to fall on them.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast Mr. Prendergast betook himself to the\r\nstudy, and there remained with his London newspaper in his hand. A\r\ndozen times he began a leading article, in which the law was laid\r\ndown with great perspicuity and certainty as to the present state of\r\nIreland; but had the writer been treating of the Sandwich Islands\r\nhe could not have attracted less of his attention. He found it\r\nimpossible to read. On that evening he would have to reveal to\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald what was to be his fate!\r\n\r\nMatthew Mollett at his last interview with Sir Thomas had promised to\r\ncall on this day, and had been counting the days till that one should\r\narrive on which he might keep his promise. He was terribly in want\r\nof cash, and as we all know Aby had entirely failed in raising the\r\nwind--any immediate fund of wind--on the occasion of his visit to the\r\nbaronet; and now, when this morning came, old Mollett was early on\r\nthe road. Aby had talked of going with him, but Aby had failed so\r\nsignally on the occasion of the visit which he did make to Castle\r\nRichmond, that he had been without the moral strength to persist in\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall write to the baronet and go alone to London," said\r\nMollett, p\xe8re.\r\n\r\n"Bother!" replied Mollett, fils. "You hain\'t got the cash, governor."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got what \'ll take me there, my boy, whether you know it or not.\r\nAnd Sir Thomas \'ll be ready enough to send me a remittance when I\'m\r\nonce out of this country."\r\n\r\nAnd so Aby had given way,--partly perhaps in terror of Mr. Somers\'\r\ncountenance; and Matthew Mollett started again in a covered car\r\non that cold journey over the Boggeragh mountains. It was still\r\nmid-winter, being now about the end of February, and the country\r\nwas colder, and wetter, and more wretched, and the people in that\r\ndesolate district more ragged and more starved than when he had last\r\ncrossed it. But what were their rags and starvation to him? He was\r\nworse off than they were. They were merely dying, as all men must do.\r\nBut he was inhabiting a hell on earth, which no man need do. They\r\ncame out to him in shoals begging; but they came in vain, getting\r\nnothing from him but a curse through his chattering teeth. What right\r\nhad they to torment with their misery one so much more wretched than\r\nthemselves?\r\n\r\nAt a little before twelve the covered car was at the front door of\r\nCastle Richmond house, and there was Richard under the porch. On\r\nformer occasions Mr. Mollett had experienced some little delay\r\nin making his way into the baronet\'s presence. The servants had\r\nlooked cold upon him, and he had felt as though there might be hot\r\nploughshares under his feet at any step which he took. But now\r\neverything seemed to be made easy. Richard took him in tow without a\r\nmoment\'s delay, told him confidentially that Sir Thomas was waiting\r\nfor him, bade the covered car to be driven round into the yard with\r\na voice that was uncommonly civil, seeing that it was addressed to a\r\nCork carman, and then ushered Mr. Mollett through the hall and down\r\nthe passage without one moment\'s delay. Wretched as he had been\r\nduring his journey--wretched as an infernal spirit--his hopes\r\nwere now again elated, and he dreamed of a golden paradise. There\r\nwas something pleasant in feeling his mastery over that poor old\r\nshattered baronet.\r\n\r\n"The gentleman to wait upon Sir Thomas," said Richard, opening the\r\nstudy door; and then Mr. Mollett senior found himself in the presence\r\nof Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast was sitting in a high-backed easy chair, facing the\r\nfire, when the announcement was made, and therefore Mollett still\r\nfancied that he was in the presence of Sir Thomas until he was well\r\ninto the room and the door was closed upon him; otherwise he might\r\nprobably have turned on his heels and bolted. He had had three or\r\nfour interviews with Mr. Prendergast, having received different\r\nsums of money from that gentleman\'s hands, and had felt on all\r\nsuch occasions that he was being looked through and through. Mr.\r\nPrendergast had asked but few questions, never going into the matter\r\nof his, Mollett\'s, pecuniary connexion with Sir Thomas; but there\r\nhad always been that in the lawyer\'s eye which had frightened the\r\nmiscreant, which had quelled his bluster as soon as it was assumed,\r\nand had told him that he was known for a blackguard and a scoundrel.\r\nAnd now when this man, with the terrible gray eye, got up from Sir\r\nThomas\'s chair, and wheeling round confronted him, looking him full\r\nin the face, and frowning on him as an honest man does frown on an\r\nunconvicted rascal--when, I say, this happened to Mr. Mollett senior,\r\nhe thoroughly at that moment wished himself back in London. He turned\r\nhis eye round to the door, but that was closed behind him. He looked\r\naround to see whether Sir Thomas was there, but no one was in the\r\nroom with him but Mr. Prendergast. Then he stood still, and as that\r\ngentleman did not address him, he was obliged to speak; the silence\r\nwas too awful for him--"Oh, Mr. Prendergast!" said he. "Is that you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Mollett, it is I."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ah--I suppose you are here about business of your own. I was\r\nwishing to see Sir Thomas about a little business of my own; maybe\r\nhe\'s not in the way."\r\n\r\n"No, he is not; not exactly. But perhaps, Mr. Mollett, I can do as\r\nwell. You have known me before, you know, and you may say to me\r\nopenly anything you have to say to Sir Thomas."\r\n\r\n"Well; I don\'t know about that, sir; my business is with the\r\nbaronet--particular." Mr. Mollett, as he spoke, strained every\r\nnerve to do so without appearance of dismay; but his efforts were\r\naltogether ineffectual. He could not bring himself to look Mr.\r\nPrendergast in the face for a moment, or avoid feeling like a dog\r\nthat dreads being kicked. All manner of fears came upon him, and he\r\nwould at the moment have given up all his hopes of money from the\r\nCastle Richmond people to have been free from Mr. Prendergast and his\r\ninfluence. And yet Mollett was not a coward in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe word. Indeed he had been very daring in the whole management of\r\nthis affair. But then a course of crime makes such violent demands\r\non a man\'s courage. Let any one think of the difference of attacking\r\na thief, and being attacked as a thief! We are apt to call bad men\r\ncowards without much consideration. Mr. Mollett was not without\r\npluck, but his pluck was now quelled. The circumstances were too\r\nstrong against him.\r\n\r\n"Listen to me, Mr. Mollett--; and, look here, sir; never mind\r\nturning to the door; you can\'t go now till you and I have had some\r\nconversation. You may make up your mind to this: you will never\r\nsee Sir Thomas Fitzgerald again--unless indeed he should be in the\r\nwitness-box when you are standing in the dock."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Prendergast; sir!"\r\n\r\n"Well. Have you any reason to give why you should not be put in the\r\ndock? How much money have you got from Sir Thomas during the last two\r\nyears by means of those threats which you have been using? You were\r\nwell aware when you set about this business that you were committing\r\nfelony; and have probably felt tolerably sure at times that you would\r\nsome day be brought up short. That day has come."\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast had made up his mind that nothing could be gained by\r\nsoft usage with Mr. Mollett. Indeed nothing could be gained in any\r\nway, by any usage, unless it could be shown that Mollett and Talbot\r\nwere not the same person. He could afford therefore to tell the\r\nscoundrel that he was a scoundrel, and to declare against him--war to\r\nthe knife. The more that Mollett trembled, the more abject he became,\r\nthe easier would be the task Mr. Prendergast now had in hand. "Well,\r\nsir," he continued, "are you going to tell me what business has\r\nbrought you here to-day?"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Mollett, though he did shake in his shoes, did not look at\r\nthe matter exactly in the same light. He could not believe that Sir\r\nThomas would himself throw up the game on any consideration, or that\r\nMr. Prendergast as his friend would throw it up on his behalf. He,\r\nMollett, had a strong feeling that he could have continued to deal\r\neasily with Sir Thomas, and that it might be very hard to deal at all\r\nwith Mr. Prendergast; but nevertheless the game was still open. Mr.\r\nPrendergast would probably distrust the fact of his being the lady\'s\r\nhusband, and it would be for him therefore to use the indubitable\r\nproofs of the facts that were in his possession.\r\n\r\n"Sir Thomas knows very well what I\'ve come about," he began, slowly;\r\n"and if he\'s told you, why you know too; and in that case--."\r\n\r\nBut what might or might not happen in that case Mr. Mollett had not\r\nnow an opportunity of explaining, for the door opened and Mrs. Jones\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\n"When that man comes this morning," Mr. Prendergast had said to\r\nHerbert, "I must get you to induce Mrs. Jones to come to us in the\r\nstudy as soon as may be." He had not at all explained to Herbert why\r\nthis was necessary, nor had he been at any pains to prevent the young\r\nheir from thinking and feeling that some terrible mystery hung over\r\nthe house. There was a terrible mystery--which indeed would be more\r\nterrible still when it ceased to be mysterious. He therefore quietly\r\nexplained to Herbert what he desired to have done, and Herbert,\r\nawaiting the promised communication of that evening, quietly did as\r\nhe was bid.\r\n\r\n"You must go down to him, Jones," he had said.\r\n\r\n"But I\'d rather not, sir. I was with him yesterday for two mortal\r\nhours; and, oh, Mr. Herbert! it ain\'t for no good."\r\n\r\nBut Herbert was inexorable; and Mrs. Jones, feeling herself overcome\r\nby the weight of the misfortune that was oppressing them all, obeyed,\r\nand descending to her master\'s study, knocked at the door. She knew\r\nthat Mr. Prendergast was there, and she knew that Sir Thomas was\r\nnot; but she did not know that any stranger was in the room with Mr.\r\nPrendergast. Mr. Mollett had not heard the knock, nor, indeed, had\r\nMr. Prendergast; but Mrs. Jones having gone through this ceremony,\r\nopened the door and entered.\r\n\r\n"Sir Thomas knows; does he?" said Mr. Prendergast, when Mollett\r\nceased to speak on the woman\'s entrance. "Oh, Mrs. Jones, good\r\nmorning. Here is your old master, Mr. Talbot."\r\n\r\nMollett of course turned round, and found himself confronted with the\r\nwoman. They stared at each other for some moments, and then Mollett\r\nsaid, in a low dull voice, "Yes, she knows me; it was she that lived\r\nwith her at Tallyho Lodge."\r\n\r\n"You remember him now, Mrs. Jones; don\'t you?" said Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\nFor another moment or two Mrs. Jones stood silent; and then she\r\nacknowledged herself overcome, and felt that the world around her had\r\nbecome too much for her. "Yes," said she, slowly; "I remembers him,"\r\nand then sinking into a chair near the door, she put her apron up to\r\nher eyes, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n"No doubt about that; she remembers me well enough," said Mollett,\r\nthinking that this was so much gained on his side. "But there ain\'t\r\na doubt about the matter at all, Mr. Prendergast. You look here,\r\nand you\'ll see it all as plain as black and white." And Mr. Mollett\r\ndragged a large pocket-book from his coat, and took out of it certain\r\ndocuments, which he held before Mr. Prendergast\'s eyes, still keeping\r\nthem in his own hand. "Oh, I\'m all right; I am," said Mollett.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you are, are you?" said the lawyer, just glancing at the paper,\r\nwhich he would not appear to heed. "I am glad you think so."\r\n\r\n"If there were any doubt about it, she\'d know," said he, pointing\r\naway up towards the body of the house. Both Mr. Prendergast and Mrs.\r\nJones understood well who was that she to whom he alluded.\r\n\r\n"You are satisfied at any rate, Mrs. Jones," said the lawyer. But\r\nMrs. Jones had hidden her face in her apron, and would not look up.\r\nShe could not understand why this friend of the family should push\r\nthe matter so dreadfully against them. If he would rise from his\r\nchair and destroy that wretch who stood before them, then indeed he\r\nmight be called a friend!\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast had now betaken himself to the door, and was standing\r\nwith his back to it, and with his hands in his trousers-pockets,\r\nclose to the chair on which Mrs. Jones was sitting. He had resolved\r\nthat he would get that woman\'s spoken evidence out of her; and he\r\nhad gotten it. But now, what was he to do with her next?--with her\r\nor with the late Mr. Talbot of Tallyho Lodge? And having satisfied\r\nhimself of that fact, which from the commencement he had never\r\ndoubted, what could he best do to spare the poor lady who was so\r\nterribly implicated in this man\'s presence?\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Jones," said he, standing over her, and gently touching her\r\nshoulder, "I am sorry to have pained you in this way; but it was\r\nnecessary that we should know, without a doubt, who this man is,--and\r\nwho he was. Truth is always the best, you know. So good a woman as\r\nyou cannot but understand that."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it is, sir,--I suppose it is," said Mrs. Jones, through\r\nher tears, now thoroughly humbled. The world was pretty nearly at\r\nan end, as far as she was concerned. Here, in this very house of\r\nCastle Richmond, in Sir Thomas\'s own room, was her ladyship\'s former\r\nhusband, acknowledged as such! What further fall of the planet into\r\nbroken fragments could terrify, or drive her from her course more\r\nthoroughly than this? Truth! yes, truth in the abstract, might be\r\nvery good. But such a truth as this! how could any one ever say that\r\nthat was good? Such was the working of her mind; but she took no\r\ntrouble to express her thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Yes," continued Mr. Prendergast, speaking still in a low voice, with\r\na tone that was almost tender, "truth is always best. Look at this\r\nwretched man here! He would have killed the whole family--destroyed\r\nthem one by one--had they consented to assist him in concealing the\r\nfact of his existence. The whole truth will now be known; and it is\r\nvery dreadful; but it will not be so dreadful as the want of truth."\r\n\r\n"My poor lady! my poor lady!" almost screamed Mrs. Jones from under\r\nher apron, wagging her head, and becoming almost convulsive in her\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is very sad. But you will live to acknowledge that even this\r\nis better than living in that man\'s power."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know that," said Mollett. "I am not so bad as you\'d make me.\r\nI don\'t want to distress the lady."\r\n\r\n"No, not if you are allowed to rob the gentleman till there\'s not a\r\nguinea left for you to suck at. I know pretty well the extent of the\r\nevil that\'s in you. If we were to kick you from here to Cork, you\'d\r\nforgive all that, so that we still allowed you to go on with your\r\ntrade. I wonder how much money you\'ve had from him altogether?"\r\n\r\n"What does the money signify? What does the money signify?" said Mrs.\r\nJones, still wagging her head beneath her apron. "Why didn\'t Sir\r\nThomas go on paying it, and then my lady need know nothing about it?"\r\n\r\nIt was clear that Mrs. Jones would not look at the matter in a\r\nproper light. As far as she could see, there was no reason why a\r\nfair bargain should not have been made between Mollett and Sir\r\nThomas,--made and kept on both sides, with mutual convenience. That\r\ndoing of justice at the cost of falling heavens was not intelligible\r\nto her limited philosophy. Nor did she bethink herself, that a\r\nleech will not give over sucking until it be gorged with blood. Mr.\r\nPrendergast knew that such leeches as Mr. Mollett never leave the\r\nskin as long as there is a drop of blood left within the veins.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast was still standing against the door, where he had\r\nplaced himself to prevent the unauthorized departure of either Mrs.\r\nJones or Mr. Mollett; but now he was bethinking himself that he might\r\nas well bring this interview to an end. "Mr. Mollett," said he, "you\r\nare probably beginning to understand that you will not get much more\r\nmoney from the Castle Richmond family?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to do any harm to any of them," said Mollett, humbly;\r\n"and if I don\'t make myself troublesome, I hope Sir Thomas will\r\nconsider me."\r\n\r\n"It is out of your power, sir, to do any further harm to any of them.\r\nYou don\'t pretend to think that after what has passed, you can have\r\nany personal authority over that unfortunate lady?"\r\n\r\n"My poor mistress! my poor mistress!" sobbed Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n"You cannot do more injury than you at present have done. No one is\r\nnow afraid of you; no one here will ever give you another shilling.\r\nWhen and in what form you will be prosecuted for inducing Sir Thomas\r\nto give you money, I cannot yet tell. Now, you may go; and I strongly\r\nadvise you never to show your face here again. If the people about\r\nhere knew who you are, and what you are, they would not let you off\r\nthe property with a whole bone in your skin. Now go, sir. Do you hear\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Mr. Prendergast, I have not intended any harm!"\r\n\r\n"Go, sir!"\r\n\r\n"And even now, Mr. Prendergast, it can all be made straight, and I\r\nwill leave the country altogether, if you wish it--"\r\n\r\n"Go, sir!" shouted Mr. Prendergast. "If you do not move at once, I\r\nwill ring the bell for the servants!"\r\n\r\n"Then, if misfortune comes upon them, it is your doing, and not\r\nmine," said Mollett.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Pendrergrass, if it can be hushed up--" said Mrs. Jones,\r\nrising from her chair and coming up to him with her hands clasped\r\ntogether. "Don\'t send him away in your anger; don\'t\'ee now, sir.\r\nThink of her ladyship. Do, do, do;" and the woman took hold of his\r\narm, and looked up into his face with her eyes swimming with tears.\r\nThen going to the door she closed it, and returning again, touched\r\nhis arm, and again appealed to him. "Think of Mr. Herbert, sir, and\r\nthe young ladies! What are they to be called, sir, if this man is to\r\nbe my lady\'s husband? Oh, Mr. Pendrergrass, let him go away, out of\r\nthe kingdom; do let him go away."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be off to Australia by the next boat, if you\'ll only say the\r\nword," said Mollett. To give him his due, he was not at that moment\r\nthinking altogether of himself and of what he might get. The idea of\r\nthe misery which he had brought on these people did, to a certain\r\nmeasure, come home to him. And it certainly did come home to him\r\nalso, that his own position was very perilous.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Jones," said the lawyer, seeming to pay no attention whatever\r\nto Mollett\'s words, "you know nothing of such men as that. If I were\r\nto take him at his word now, he would turn upon Sir Thomas again\r\nbefore three weeks were over."\r\n\r\n"By ----, I would not! By all that is holy, I would not. Mr.\r\nPrendergast, do--."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mollett, I will trouble you to walk out of this house. I have\r\nnothing further to say to you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well, sir." And then slowly Mollett took his departure,\r\nand finding his covered car at the door, got into it without saying\r\nanother word to any of the Castle Richmond family.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Jones," said Mr. Prendergast, as soon as Mollett was gone, "I\r\nbelieve I need not trouble you any further. Your conduct has done you\r\ngreat honour, and I respect you greatly as an honest woman and an\r\naffectionate friend."\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones could only acknowledge this by loud sobs.\r\n\r\n"For the present, if you will take my advice, you will say nothing of\r\nthis to your mistress."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, no; I shall say nothing. Oh, dear! oh dear!"\r\n\r\n"The whole matter will be known soon, but in the mean time, we may as\r\nwell remain silent. Good day to you." And then Mrs. Jones also left\r\nthe room, and Mr. Prendergast was alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFAIR ARGUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mollett left the house he saw two men walking down the road\r\naway from the sweep before the hall door, and as he passed them he\r\nrecognised one as the young gentleman of the house. He also saw that\r\na horse followed behind them, on the grass by the roadside, not led\r\nby the hand, but following with the reins laid loose upon his neck.\r\nThey took no notice of him or his car, but allowed him to pass as\r\nthough he had no concern whatever with the destinies of either of\r\nthem. They were Herbert and Owen Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perhaps remember the way in which Owen left Desmond\r\nCourt on the occasion of his last visit there. It cannot be said\r\nthat what he had heard had in any way humbled him, nor indeed had it\r\ntaught him to think that Clara Desmond looked at him altogether with\r\nindifference. Greatly as she had injured him, he could not bring\r\nhimself to look upon her as the chief sinner. It was Lady Desmond who\r\nhad done it all. It was she who had turned against him because of his\r\npoverty, who had sold her daughter to his rich cousin, and robbed\r\nhim of the love which he had won for himself. Or perhaps not of\r\nthe love--it might be that this was yet his; and if so, was it not\r\npossible that he might beat the countess at her own weapons? Thinking\r\nover this, he felt that it was necessary for him to do something, to\r\ntake some step; and therefore he resolved to go boldly to his cousin,\r\nand tell him that he regarded Lady Clara Desmond as still his own.\r\n\r\nOn this morning, therefore, he had ridden up to the Castle Richmond\r\ndoor. It was now many months since he had been there, and he was\r\nno longer entitled to enter the house on the acknowledged intimate\r\nfooting of a cousin. He rode up, and asked the servant with grave\r\nceremony whether Mr. Herbert Fitzgerald were at home. He would not go\r\nin, he said, but if Mr. Herbert were there he would wait for him at\r\nthe porch. Herbert at the time was standing in the dining-room, all\r\nalone, gloomily leaning against the mantelpiece. There was nothing\r\nfor him to do during the whole of that day but wait for the evening,\r\nwhen the promised revelation would be made to him. He knew that\r\nMollett and Mrs. Jones were with Mr. Prendergast in the study, but\r\nwhat was the matter now being investigated between them--that he did\r\nnot know. And till he knew that, closely as he was himself concerned,\r\nhe could meddle with nothing. But it was already past noon and the\r\nevening would soon be there.\r\n\r\nIn this mood he was interrupted by being told that his cousin Owen\r\nwas at the door. "He won\'t come in at all, Mr. Herbert," Richard\r\nhad said; for Richard, according to order, was still waiting about\r\nthe porch; "but he says that you are to go to him there." And then\r\nHerbert, after considering the matter for a moment, joined his cousin\r\nat the front entrance.\r\n\r\n"I want to speak to you a few words," said Owen; "but as I hear that\r\nSir Thomas is not well, I will not go into the house; perhaps you\r\nwill walk with me as far as the lodge. Never mind the mare, she will\r\nnot go astray." And so Herbert got his hat and accompanied him. For\r\nthe first hundred yards neither of them said anything. Owen would not\r\nspeak of Clara till he was well out of hearing from the house, and\r\nat the present moment Herbert had not much inclination to commence a\r\nconversation on any subject.\r\n\r\nOwen was the first to speak. "Herbert," said he, "I have been told\r\nthat you are engaged to marry Lady Clara Desmond."\r\n\r\n"And so I am," said Herbert, feeling very little inclined to admit\r\nof any question as to his privilege in that respect. Things were\r\nhappening around him which might have--Heaven only knows what\r\nconsequence. He did fear--fear with a terrible dread that something\r\nmight occur which would shatter the cup of his happiness, and rob him\r\nof the fruition of his hopes. But nothing had occurred as yet. "And\r\nso I am," he said; "it is no wonder that you should have heard it,\r\nfor it has been kept no secret. And I also have heard of your visit\r\nto Desmond Court. It might have been as well, I think, if you had\r\nstayed away."\r\n\r\n"I thought differently," said Owen, frowning blackly. "I thought that\r\nthe most straightforward thing for me was to go there openly, having\r\nannounced my intention, and tell them both, mother and daughter,\r\nthat I hold myself as engaged to Lady Clara, and that I hold her as\r\nengaged to me."\r\n\r\n"That is absurd nonsense. She cannot be engaged to two persons."\r\n\r\n"Anything that interferes with you, you will of course think absurd.\r\nI think otherwise. It is hardly more than twelve months since she and\r\nI were walking there together, and then she promised me her love. I\r\nhad known her long and well, when you had hardly seen her. I knew her\r\nand loved her; and what is more, she loved me. Remember, it is not I\r\nonly that say so. She said it herself, and swore that nothing should\r\nchange her. I do not believe that anything has changed her."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that at present she cares nothing for me? Owen,\r\nyou must be mad on this matter."\r\n\r\n"Mad; yes, of course; if I think that any girl can care for me while\r\nyou are in the way. Strange as it may appear, I am as mad even as\r\nthat. There are people who will not sell themselves even for money\r\nand titles. I say again, that I do not believe her to be changed.\r\nShe has been weak, and her mother has persuaded her. To her mother,\r\nrank and money, titles and property, are everything. She has sold\r\nher daughter, and I have come to ask you, whether, under such\r\ncircumstances, you intend to accept the purchase."\r\n\r\nIn his ordinary mood Herbert Fitzgerald was by no means a quarrelsome\r\nman. Indeed we may go further than that, and say that he was very\r\nmuch the reverse. His mind was argumentative rather than impulsive,\r\nand in all matters he was readier to persuade than overcome. But his\r\nordinary nature had been changed. It was quite new with him to be\r\nnervous and fretful, but he was so at the present moment. He was\r\ndeeply concerned in the circumstances around him, but yet had been\r\nallowed no voice in them. In this affair that was so peculiarly his\r\nown,--this of his promised bride, he was determined that no voice\r\nshould be heard but his own; and now, contrary to his wont, he was\r\nready enough to quarrel with his cousin.\r\n\r\nOf Owen we may say, that he was a man prone to fighting of all sorts,\r\nand on all occasions. By fighting I do not mean the old-fashioned\r\nresource of putting an end to fighting by the aid of two pistols,\r\nwhich were harmless in nineteen cases out of twenty. In saying that\r\nOwen Fitzgerald was prone to fight, I do not allude to fighting of\r\nthat sort; I mean that he was impulsive, and ever anxious to contend\r\nand conquer. To yield was to him ignoble, even though he might know\r\nthat he was yielding to the right. To strive for mastery was to\r\nhim noble, even though he strove against those who had a right to\r\nrule, and strove on behalf of the wrong. Such was the nature of his\r\nmind and spirit; and this nature had impelled him to his present\r\nenterprise at Castle Richmond. But he had gone thither with an\r\nunwonted resolve not to be passionate. He had, he had said to\r\nhimself, right on his side, and he had purposed to argue it out\r\nfairly with his more cold-blooded cousin. The reader may probably\r\nguess the result of these fair arguments on such a subject. "And I\r\nhave come to ask you," he said, "whether under such circumstances you\r\nintend to accept the purchase?"\r\n\r\n"I will not allow you to speak of Lady Desmond in such language; nor\r\nof her daughter," said Herbert, angrily.\r\n\r\n"Ah! but, Herbert, you must allow me; I have been ill used in this\r\nmatter, and I have a right to make myself heard."\r\n\r\n"Is it I that have ill used you? I did not know before that gentlemen\r\nmade loud complaints of such ill usage from the hands of ladies."\r\n\r\n"If the ill usage, as you please to call it--"\r\n\r\n"It is your own word."\r\n\r\n"Very well. If this ill usage came from Clara Desmond herself, I\r\nshould be the last person to complain of it; and you would be the\r\nlast person to whom I should make complaint. But I feel sure that it\r\nis not so. She is acting under the influence of her mother, who has\r\nfrightened her into this thing which she is doing. I do not believe\r\nthat she is false herself."\r\n\r\n"I am sure that she is not false. We are quite agreed there, but it\r\nis not likely that we should agree further. To tell you the truth\r\nfrankly I think you are ill-judged to speak to me on such a topic."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps in that respect you will allow me to think for myself. But I\r\nhave not yet said that which I came to say. My belief is that unfair\r\nand improper restraint is put upon Clara Desmond, that she has been\r\ninduced by her mother to accept your offer in opposition to her\r\nown wishes, and that therefore it is my duty to look upon her as\r\nstill betrothed to me. I do so regard her, and shall act under such\r\nconviction. The first thing that I do therefore is to call upon you\r\nto relinquish your claim."\r\n\r\n"What, to give her up?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to give her up;--to acknowledge that you cannot honestly call\r\nupon her to fulfil her pledge to you."\r\n\r\n"The man must be raving," Herbert said.\r\n\r\n"Very probably; but remember this, it may be that he will rave to\r\nsome purpose, when such insolence will be but of little avail to you.\r\nRaving! Yes, I suppose that a man poor as I am must be mad indeed to\r\nset his heart upon anything that you may choose to fancy."\r\n\r\n"All that is nonsense; Owen, I ask for nothing but my own. I won her\r\nlove fairly, and I mean to keep it firmly."\r\n\r\n"You may possibly have won her hand, but never her heart. You are\r\nrich, and it may be that even she will condescend to barter her hand;\r\nbut I doubt it; I altogether doubt it. It is her mother\'s doing, as\r\nit was plain enough for me to see the other day at Desmond Court; but\r\nmuch as she may fear her mother, I cannot think that she will go to\r\nthe altar with a lie in her mouth."\r\n\r\nAnd then they walked on in silence for a few yards. Herbert was\r\nanxious to get back to the house, and was by no means desirous of\r\ncontinuing this conversation with his cousin. He at any rate could\r\nget nothing by talking about Lady Clara Desmond to Owen Fitzgerald.\r\nHe stopped therefore on the path, and said, that if Owen had nothing\r\nfurther to say, he, Herbert, would go back to the house.\r\n\r\n"Nothing further! Nothing further, if you understand me; but you\r\ndo not. You are not honest enough in this matter to understand any\r\npurpose but your own."\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, Owen: I did not come out here to hear myself\r\nabused; and I will not stand it. According to my idea you had no\r\nright whatever to speak to me about Lady Clara Desmond. But you are\r\nmy cousin; and therefore I have borne it. It may be as well that we\r\nshould both understand that it is once for all. I will not listen to\r\nyou again on the same subject."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you won\'t. Upon my word you are a very great man! You will tell\r\nme next, I suppose, that this is your demesne, and will warn me off!"\r\n\r\n"Even if I did that, I should not be wrong, under such provocation."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir; then I will go off. But remember this, Herbert\r\nFitzgerald, you shall live to rue the day when you treated me with\r\nsuch insolence. And remember this also, Clara Desmond is not your\r\nwife as yet. Everything now seems happy with you, and fortunate; you\r\nhave wealth and a fine house, and a family round you, while I am\r\nthere all alone, left like a dog, as far as my own relatives are\r\nconcerned. But yet it may come to pass that the Earl of Desmond\'s\r\ndaughter will prefer my hand to yours, and my house to your house.\r\nThey who mount high may chance to get a fall." And then, having\r\nuttered this caution, he turned to his mare, and putting his hand\r\nupon the saddle, jumped into his seat, and pressing her into a\r\ngallop, darted off across the grass.\r\n\r\nHe had not meant anything specially by his threat; but his heart was\r\nsore within him. During some weeks past, he had become sick of the\r\nlife that he was leading. He had begun to hate his own solitary\r\nhouse--his house that was either solitary, or filled with riot and\r\nnoise. He sighed for the quiet hours that were once his at Desmond\r\nCourt, and the privilege of constant entrance there, which was now\r\ndenied him. His cousin Herbert had everything at his command--wealth,\r\nstation, family ties, society, and all the consideration of high\r\nplace. Every blessing was at the feet of the young heir; but every\r\nblessing was not enough, unless Clara Desmond was also added. All\r\nthis seemed so cruel to him, as he sat alone in his parlour at Hap\r\nHouse, meditating on his future course of life! And then he would\r\nthink of Clara\'s promise, of her assurance that nothing should\r\nfrighten her from her pledge. He thought of this as though the words\r\nhad been spoken to him only yesterday. He pondered over these things\r\ntill he hated his cousin Herbert; and hating him, he vowed that Clara\r\nDesmond should not be his wife. "Is he to have everything?" he would\r\nsay to himself. "No, by heavens! not everything. He has enough, and\r\nmay be contented; but he shall not have all." And now, with similar\r\nthoughts running through his mind, he rode back to Hap House.\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert turned back to Castle Richmond. As he approached the\r\nfront door, he met Mr. Prendergast, who was leaving the house; but\r\nthey had no conversation with each other. Herbert was in hopes that\r\nhe might now, at once, be put out of suspense. Mollett was gone; and\r\nwould it not be better that the tale should be told? But it was clear\r\nthat Mr. Prendergast had no intention of lessening by an hour the\r\ninterval he had given himself. He merely muttered a few words passing\r\non, and Herbert went into the house.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was another long, tedious, dull afternoon. Herbert sat\r\nwith his sisters, but they had not the heart to talk to each other.\r\nAt about four a note was brought to him. It was from Mr. Prendergast,\r\nbegging Herbert to meet him in Sir Thomas\'s study at eight. Sir\r\nThomas had not been there during the day; and now did not intend to\r\nleave his own room. They dined at half-past six; and the appointment\r\nwas therefore to take place almost immediately after dinner.\r\n\r\n"Tell Mr. Prendergast that I will be there," he said to the servant.\r\nAnd so that afternoon passed away, and the dinner also, very slowly\r\nand very sadly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE TELLING OF THE TALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dinner passed away as the former dinners had done; and as soon\r\nas Aunt Letty got up Mr. Prendergast also rose, and touching Herbert\r\non his shoulder, whispered into his ear, "You\'ll come to me at eight\r\nthen." Herbert nodded his head; and when he was alone he looked\r\nat his watch. These slow dinners were not actually very long, and\r\nthere still remained to him some three-quarters of an hour for\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be the nature of this history? That it would affect\r\nhimself personally in the closest manner he could not but know.\r\nThere seemed to be no doubt on the minds of any of them that the\r\naffair was one of money, and his father\'s money questions were his\r\nmoney questions. Mr. Prendergast would not have been sent for with\r\nreference to any trifle; nor would any pecuniary difficulty that was\r\nnot very serious have thrown his father into such a state of misery.\r\nCould it be that the fair inheritance was absolutely in danger?\r\n\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald was by no means a selfish man. As regarded\r\nhimself, he could have met ruin in the face with more equanimity than\r\nmost young men so circumstanced. The gilt of the world had not eaten\r\ninto his soul; his heart was not as yet wedded to the splendour of\r\npinchbeck. This is saying much for him; for how seldom is it that the\r\nhearts and souls of the young are able to withstand pinchbeck and\r\ngilding? He was free from this pusillanimity; free as yet as regarded\r\nhimself; but he was hardly free as regarded his betrothed. He had\r\npromised her, not in spoken words but in his thoughts, rank, wealth,\r\nand all the luxuries of his promised high position; and now on\r\nher behalf, it nearly broke his heart to think that they might be\r\nendangered.\r\n\r\nOf his mother\'s history, he can hardly be said to have known\r\nanything. That there had been something tragic in her early life;\r\nthat something had occurred before his father\'s marriage; and that\r\nhis mother had been married twice, he had learned,--he hardly\r\nknew when or from whom. But on such matters there had never been\r\nconversation between him and any of his own family; and it never\r\noccurred to him that all this sorrow arose in any way from this\r\nsubject. That his father had taken some fatal step with regard to the\r\nproperty--had done some foolish thing for which he could not forgive\r\nhimself, that was the idea with which his mind was filled.\r\n\r\nHe waited, with his watch in his hand, till the dial showed him that\r\nit was exactly eight; and then, with a sinking heart, he walked\r\nslowly out of the dining-room along the passage, and into his\r\nfather\'s study. For an instant he stood with the handle in his hand.\r\nHe had been terribly anxious for the arrival of this moment, but now\r\nthat it had come, he would almost fain have had it again postponed.\r\nHis heart sank very low as he turned the lock, and entering, found\r\nhimself in the presence of Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast was standing with his back to the fire. For him, too,\r\nthe last hour had been full of bitterness; his heart also had sunk\r\nlow within him; his blood had run cold within his veins: he too, had\r\nit been possible, would have put off this wretched hour.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast, it may be, was not much given to poetry; but the\r\nfeeling, if not the words, were there within him. The work which a\r\nfriend has to perform for a friend is so much heavier than that which\r\ncomes in the way of any profession!\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert entered the room, Mr. Prendergast came forward from\r\nwhere he was standing, and took him by the hand. "This is a very sad\r\naffair," he said; "very sad."\r\n\r\n"At present I know nothing about it," said Herbert. "As I see people\r\nabout me so unhappy, I suppose it is sad. If there be anything that I\r\nhate, it is a mystery."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, Mr. Fitzgerald," said the other; "sit down." And Mr.\r\nPrendergast himself sat down in the chair that was ordinarily\r\noccupied by Sir Thomas. Although he had been thinking about it all\r\nthe day, he had not even yet made up his mind how he was to begin\r\nhis story. Even now he could not help thinking whether it might be\r\npossible for him to leave it untold. But it was not possible.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald," said he, "you must prepare yourself for tidings\r\nwhich are very grievous indeed--very grievous."\r\n\r\n"Whatever it is I must bear it," said he.\r\n\r\n"I hope you have that moral strength which enables a man to bear\r\nmisfortune. I have not known you in happy days, and therefore perhaps\r\ncan hardly judge; but it seems to me that you do possess such\r\ncourage. Did I not think so, I could hardly go through the task that\r\nis before me."\r\n\r\nHere he paused as though he expected some reply, some assurance that\r\nhis young friend did possess this strength of which he spoke; but\r\nHerbert said nothing--nothing out loud. "If it were only for myself!\r\nif it were only for myself!" It was thus that he spoke to his own\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald," continued the lawyer, "I do not know how far you\r\nmay be acquainted with the history of your mother\'s first marriage."\r\n\r\nHerbert said that he was hardly acquainted with it in any degree;\r\nand explained that he merely knew the fact that his mother had been\r\nmarried before she met Sir Thomas.\r\n\r\n"I do not know that I need recount all the circumstances to you\r\nnow, though doubtless you will learn them. Your mother\'s conduct\r\nthroughout was, I believe, admirable."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure of that. No amount of evidence could make me believe\r\nthe contrary."\r\n\r\n"And there is no tittle of evidence to make any one think so. But\r\nin her early youth, when she was quite a child, she was given in\r\nmarriage to a man--to a man of whom it is impossible to speak in\r\nterms too black, or in language too strong. And now, this day--"\r\n\r\nBut here he paused. It had been his intention to say that that very\r\nman, the first husband of this loved mother now looked upon as dead\r\nfor so many years, this miscreant of whom he had spoken--that this\r\nman had been in that room that very day. But he hardly knew how to\r\nframe the words.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Herbert, "well;" and he spoke in a hoarse voice that was\r\nscarcely audible.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast was afraid to bring out the very pith of his story in\r\nso abrupt a manner. He wished to have the work over, to feel, that as\r\nregarded Herbert it was done,--but his heart failed him when he came\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, going back as it were to his former thoughts. "A\r\nheartless, cruel, debauched, unscrupulous man; one in whose bosom no\r\ngood thing seemed to have been implanted. Your father, when he first\r\nknew your mother, had every reason to believe that this man was\r\ndead."\r\n\r\n"And he was not dead?" Mr. Prendergast could see that the young man\'s\r\nface became perfectly pale as he uttered these words. He became pale,\r\nand clutched hold of the table with his hand, and there sat with\r\nmouth open and staring eyes.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid not," said Mr. Prendergast; "I am afraid not."\r\n\r\n"And--"\r\n\r\n"I must go further than that, and tell you that he is still living."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Prendergast, Mr. Prendergast!" exclaimed the poor fellow,\r\nrising up from his chair and shouting out as though for mercy. Mr.\r\nPrendergast also rose from his seat, and coming up to him took him by\r\nthe arm. "My dear boy, my dear boy, I am obliged to tell you. It is\r\nnecessary that you should know it. The fact is as I say, and it is\r\nnow for you to show that you are a man."\r\n\r\nWho was ever called upon for a stronger proof of manhood than this?\r\nIn nine cases out of ten it is not for oneself that one has to be\r\nbrave. A man, we may almost say, is no man, whose own individual\r\nsufferings call for the exercise of much courage. But we are all so\r\nmixed up and conjoined with others--with others who are weaker and\r\ndearer than ourselves, that great sorrows do require great powers of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, as he stood there in silence, the whole truth made its\r\nway into his mind,--as he stood there with his arm still tenderly\r\npressed by that old man. No one now would have called the lawyer\r\nstern in looking at him, for the tears were coursing down his cheeks.\r\nBut no tears came to the relief of young Fitzgerald as the truth\r\nslowly came upon him, fold by fold, black cloud upon cloud, till the\r\nwhole horizon of his life\'s prospect was dark as death. He stood\r\nthere silent for some few minutes hardly conscious that he was not\r\nalone, as he saw all his joys disappearing from before his mind\'s\r\neye, one by one; his family pride, the pleasant high-toned duties of\r\nhis station, his promised seat in Parliament and prosperous ambition,\r\nthe full respect of all the world around him, his wealth and pride of\r\nplace--for let no man be credited who boasts that he can part with\r\nthese without regret. All these were gone. But there were losses more\r\nbitter than these. How could he think of his affianced bride? and how\r\ncould he think of his mother?\r\n\r\nNo tears came to his relief while the truth, with all its bearings,\r\nburnt itself into his very soul, but his face expressed such agony\r\nthat it was terrible to be seen. Mr. Prendergast could stand that\r\nsilence no longer, so at last he spoke. He spoke,--for the sake of\r\nwords; for all his tale had been told.\r\n\r\n"You saw the man that was here yesterday? That was he, who then\r\ncalled himself Talbot."\r\n\r\n"What! the man that went away in the car? Mollett?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; that was the man."\r\n\r\nHerbert had said that no evidence could be sufficient to make him\r\nbelieve that his mother had been in any way culpable: and such\r\nprobably was the case. He had that reliance on his mother--that\r\nassurance in his mind that everything coming from her must\r\nbe good--that he could not believe her capable of ill. But,\r\nnevertheless, he could not prevent himself from asking within his\r\nown breast, how it had been possible that his mother should ever\r\nhave been concerned with such a wretch as that. It was a question\r\nwhich could not fail to make itself audible. What being on earth was\r\nsweeter than his mother, more excellent, more noble, more fitted for\r\nthe world\'s high places, more absolutely entitled to that universal\r\nrespect which seemed to be given to her as her own by right? And what\r\nbeing could be more loathsome, more contemptible than he, who was,\r\nas he was now told, his mother\'s husband? There was in it a want of\r\nverisimilitude which almost gave him comfort,--which almost taught\r\nhim to think that he might disbelieve the story that was told to him.\r\nPoor fellow! he had yet to learn the difference that years may make\r\nin men and women--for better as well as for worse. Circumstances had\r\ngiven to the poor half-educated village girl the simple dignity of\r\nhigh station; as circumstances had also brought to the lowest dregs\r\nof human existence the man, whose personal bearing, and apparent\r\nworldly standing had been held sufficient to give warrant that he was\r\nof gentle breeding and of honest standing; nay, her good fortune in\r\nsuch a marriage had once been almost begrudged her by all her maiden\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nBut Herbert, as he thought of this, was almost encouraged to\r\ndisbelieve the story. To him, with his knowledge of what his mother\r\nwas, and such knowledge as he also had of that man, it did not seem\r\npossible. "But how is all this known?" he muttered forth at last.\r\n\r\n"I fear there is no doubt of its truth," said Mr. Prendergast. "Your\r\nfather has no doubt whatever; has had none--I must tell you this\r\nplainly--for some months."\r\n\r\n"For some months! And why have I not been told?"\r\n\r\n"Do not be hard upon your father."\r\n\r\n"Hard! no; of course I would not be hard upon him."\r\n\r\n"The burden he has had to bear has been very terrible. He has thought\r\nthat by payments of money to this man the whole thing might be\r\nconcealed. As is always the case when such payments are made, the\r\ninsatiable love of money grew by what it fed on. He would have poured\r\nout every shilling into that man\'s hands, and would have died,\r\nhimself a beggar--have died speedily too under such torments--and yet\r\nno good would have been done. The harpy would have come upon you; and\r\nyou--after you had innocently assumed a title that was not your own\r\nand taken a property to which you have no right, you then would have\r\nhad to own--that which your father must own now."\r\n\r\n"If it be so," said Herbert, slowly, "it must be acknowledged."\r\n\r\n"Just so, Mr. Fitzgerald; just so. I know you will feel that--in\r\nsuch matters we can only sail safely by the truth. There is no other\r\ncompass worth a man\'s while to look at."\r\n\r\n"Of course not," said Herbert, with hoarse voice. "One does not wish\r\nto be a robber and a thief. My cousin shall have what is his own."\r\nAnd then he involuntarily thought of the interview they had had on\r\nthat very day. "But why did he not tell me when I spoke to him of\r\nher?" he said, with something approaching to bitterness in his voice\r\nand a slight struggle in his throat that was almost premonitory of a\r\nsob.\r\n\r\n"Ah! it is there that I fear for you. I know what your feelings are;\r\nbut think of his sorrows, and do not be hard on him."\r\n\r\n"Ah me, ah me!" exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\n"I fear that he will not be with you long. He has already endured\r\ntill he is now almost past the power of suffering more. And yet there\r\nis so much more that he must suffer!"\r\n\r\n"My poor father!"\r\n\r\n"Think what such as he must have gone through in bringing himself\r\ninto contact with that man; and all this has been done that he might\r\nspare you and your mother. Think of the wound to his conscience\r\nbefore he would have lowered himself to an unworthy bargain with a\r\nswindler. But this has been done that you might have that which you\r\nhave been taught to look on as your own. He has been wrong. No other\r\nverdict can be given. But you, at any rate, can be tender to such a\r\nfault; you and your mother."\r\n\r\n"I will--I will," said Herbert. "But if it had happened a month since\r\nI could have borne it." And then he thought of his mother, and hated\r\nhimself for what he had said. How could he have borne that with\r\npatience? "And there is no doubt, you say?"\r\n\r\n"I think none. The man carries his proofs with him. An old servant\r\nhere in the house, too, knows him."\r\n\r\n"What, Mrs. Jones?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Mrs. Jones. And the burden of further proof must now, of\r\ncourse, be thrown on us,--not on him. Directly that we believe the\r\nstatement, it is for us to ascertain its truth. You and your father\r\nmust not be seen to hold a false position before the world."\r\n\r\n"And what are we to do now?"\r\n\r\n"I fear that your mother must be told, and Mr. Owen Fitzgerald; and\r\nthen we must together openly prove the facts, either in one way or in\r\nthe other. It will be better that we should do this together;--that\r\nis, you and your cousin Owen conjointly. Do it openly, before the\r\nworld,--so that the world may know that each of you desires only what\r\nis honestly his own. For myself I tell you fairly that I have no\r\ndoubt of the truth of what I have told you; but further proof is\r\ncertainly needed. Had I any doubt I would not propose to tell your\r\nmother. As it is I think it will be wrong to keep her longer in the\r\ndark."\r\n\r\n"Does she suspect nothing?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know. She has more power of self-control than your father.\r\nShe has not spoken to me ten words since I have been in the house,\r\nand in not doing so I have thought that she was right."\r\n\r\n"My own mother; my dear mother!"\r\n\r\n"If you ask me my opinion, I think that she does suspect the\r\ntruth,--very vaguely, with an indefinite feeling that the calamity\r\nwhich weighs so heavily on your father, has come from this source.\r\nShe, dear lady, is greatly to be pitied. But God has made her of\r\nfirmer material than your father, and I think that she will bear her\r\nsorrow with a higher courage."\r\n\r\n"And she is to be told also?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so. I do not see how we can avoid it. If we do not tell\r\nher we must attempt to conceal it, and that attempt must needs be\r\nfutile when we are engaged in making open inquiry on the subject.\r\nYour cousin, when he hears of this, will of course be anxious to know\r\nwhat his real prospects are."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. He will be anxious, and determined too."\r\n\r\n"And then, when all the world will know it, how is your mother to be\r\nkept in the dark? And that which she fears and anticipates is as bad,\r\nprobably, as the actual truth. If my advice be followed nothing will\r\nbe kept from her."\r\n\r\n"We are in your hands, I suppose, Mr. Prendergast?"\r\n\r\n"I can only act as my judgment directs me."\r\n\r\n"And who is to tell her?" This he asked with a shudder, and almost in\r\na whisper. The very idea of undertaking such a duty seemed almost too\r\nmuch for him. And yet he must undertake a duty almost as terrible; he\r\nhimself--no one but him--must endure the anguish of repeating this\r\nstory to Clara Desmond and to the countess. But now the question had\r\nreference to his own mother. "And who is to tell her?" he asked.\r\n\r\nFor a moment or two Mr. Prendergast stood silent. He had not\r\nhitherto, in so many words, undertaken this task--this that would be\r\nthe most dreadful of all. But if he did not undertake it, who would?\r\n"I suppose that I must do it," at last he said, very gently.\r\n\r\n"And when?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as I have told your cousin. I will go down to him to-morrow\r\nafter breakfast. Is it probable that I shall find him at home?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, if you are there before ten. The hounds meet to-morrow at\r\nCecilstown, within three miles of him, and he will not leave home\r\ntill near eleven. But it is possible that he may have a house full of\r\nmen with him."\r\n\r\n"At any rate I will try. On such an occasion as this he may surely\r\nlet his friends go to the hunt without him."\r\n\r\nAnd then between nine and ten this interview came to an end. "Mr.\r\nFitzgerald," said Mr. Prendergast, as he pressed Herbert\'s hand,\r\n"you have borne all this as a man should do. No loss of fortune can\r\nruin one who is so well able to endure misfortune." But in this Mr.\r\nPrendergast was perhaps mistaken. His knowledge of human nature had\r\nnot carried him sufficiently far. A man\'s courage under calamity\r\nis only tested when he is left in solitude. The meanest among us\r\ncan bear up while strange eyes are looking at us. And then Mr.\r\nPrendergast went away, and he was alone.\r\n\r\nIt had been his habit during the whole of this period of his father\'s\r\nillness to go to Sir Thomas at or before bedtime. These visits\r\nhad usually been made to the study, the room in which he was now\r\nstanding; but when his father had gone to his bedroom at an earlier\r\nhour, Herbert had always seen him there. Was he to go to him now--now\r\nthat he had heard all this? And if so, how was he to bear himself\r\nthere, in his father\'s presence? He stood still, thinking of this,\r\ntill the hand of the clock showed him that it was past ten, and then\r\nit struck him that his father might be waiting for him. It would not\r\ndo for him now, at such a moment, to appear wanting in that attention\r\nwhich he had always shown. He was still his father\'s son, though he\r\nhad lost the right to bear his father\'s name. He was nameless now, a\r\nman utterly without respect or standing-place in the world, a being\r\nwhom the law ignored except as the possessor of a mere life; such was\r\nhe now, instead of one whose rights and privileges, whose property\r\nand rank all the statutes of the realm and customs of his country\r\ndelighted to honour and protect. This he repeated to himself over\r\nand over again. It was to such a pass as this, to this bitter\r\ndisappointment that his father had brought him. But yet it should not\r\nbe said of him that he had begun to neglect his father as soon as he\r\nhad heard the story.\r\n\r\nSo with a weary step he walked up stairs, and found Sir Thomas in\r\nbed, with his mother sitting by the bedside. His mother held out her\r\nhand to him, and he took it, leaning against the bedside. "Has Mr.\r\nPrendergast left you?" she asked.\r\n\r\nHe told her that Mr. Prendergast had left him, and gone to his own\r\nroom for the night. "And have you been with him all the evening?" she\r\nasked. She had no special motive in so asking, but both the father\r\nand the son shuddered at the question. "Yes," said Herbert; "I have\r\nbeen with him, and now I have come to wish my father good night; and\r\nyou too, mother, if you intend to remain here." But Lady Fitzgerald\r\ngot up, telling Herbert that she would leave him with Sir Thomas; and\r\nbefore either of them could hinder her from departing, the father and\r\nthe son were alone together.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas, when the door closed, looked furtively up into his son\'s\r\nface. Might it be that he could read there how much had been already\r\ntold, or how much still remained to be disclosed? That Herbert was\r\nto learn it all that evening, he knew; but it might be that Mr.\r\nPrendergast had failed to perform his task. Sir Thomas in his heart\r\ntrusted that he had failed. He looked up furtively into Herbert\'s\r\nface, but at the moment there was nothing there that he could read.\r\nThere was nothing there but black misery; and every face round him\r\nfor many days past had worn that aspect.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two Herbert said nothing, for he had not made up his\r\nmind whether or no he would that night disturb his father\'s rest.\r\nBut he could not speak in his ordinary voice, or bid his father\r\ngood-night as though nothing special to him had happened. "Father,"\r\nsaid he, after a short pause, "father, I know it all now."\r\n\r\n"My boy, my poor boy, my unfortunate boy!"\r\n\r\n"Father," said Herbert, "do not be unhappy about me, I can bear it."\r\nAnd then he thought again of his bride--his bride as she was to have\r\nbeen; but nevertheless he repeated his last words, "I can bear it,\r\nfather!"\r\n\r\n"I have meant it for the best, Herbert," said the poor man, pleading\r\nto his child.\r\n\r\n"I know that; all of us well know that. But what Mr. Prendergast says\r\nis true; it is better that it should be known. That man would have\r\nkilled you had you kept it longer to yourself."\r\n\r\nSir Thomas hid his face upon the pillow as the remembrance of what he\r\nhad endured in those meetings came upon him. The blow that had told\r\nheaviest was that visit from the son, and the threats which the man\r\nhad made still rung in his ears--"When that youngster was born Lady\r\nF. was Mrs. M., wasn\'t she? . . . My governor could take her away\r\nto-morrow, according to the law of the land, couldn\'t he now?" These\r\nwords, and more such as these, had nearly killed him at the time, and\r\nnow, as they recurred to him, he burst out into childish tears. Poor\r\nman! the days of his manhood had gone, and nothing but the tears of\r\na second bitter childhood remained to him. The hot iron had entered\r\ninto his soul, and shrivelled up the very muscles of his mind\'s\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nHerbert, without much thought of what he was doing, knelt down by\r\nthe bedside and put his hand upon that of his father which lay out\r\nupon the sheet. There he knelt for one or two minutes, watching and\r\nlistening to his father\'s sobs. "You will be better now, father," he\r\nsaid, "for the great weight of this terrible secret will be off your\r\nmind." But Sir Thomas did not answer him. With him there could never\r\nbe any better. All things belonging to him had gone to ruin. All\r\nthose around him whom he had loved--and he had loved those around him\r\nvery dearly--were brought to poverty, and sorrow, and disgrace. The\r\npower of feeling this was left to him, but the power of enduring this\r\nwith manhood was gone. The blow had come upon him too late in life.\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert himself, as he knelt there, could hardly forbear from\r\ntears. Now, at such a moment as this, he could think of no one but\r\nhis father, the author of his being, who lay there so grievously\r\nafflicted by sorrows which were in nowise selfish. "Father," he said\r\nat last, "will you pray with me?" And then when the poor sufferer\r\nhad turned his face towards him, he poured forth his prayer to his\r\nSaviour that they all in that family might be enabled to bear the\r\nheavy sorrows which God in his mercy and wisdom had now thought fit\r\nto lay upon them. I will not make his words profane by repeating them\r\nhere, but one may say confidently that they were not uttered in vain.\r\n\r\n"And now, dearest father, good night," he said as he rose from his\r\nknees; and stretching over the bed, he kissed his father\'s forehead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nBEFORE BREAKFAST AT HAP HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined that Mr. Mollett\'s drive back to Cork after his\r\nlast visit to Castle Richmond had not been very pleasant; and indeed\r\nit may be said that his present circumstances altogether were as\r\nunpleasant as his worst enemies could desire. I have endeavoured to\r\nexcite the sympathy of those who are going with me through this story\r\nfor the sufferings of that family of the Fitzgeralds; but how shall\r\nI succeed in exciting their sympathy for this other family of the\r\nMolletts? And yet why not? If we are to sympathise only with the\r\ngood, or worse still, only with the graceful, how little will there\r\nbe in our character that is better than terrestrial? Those Molletts\r\nalso were human, and had strings to their hearts, at which the world\r\nwould now probably pull with sufficient vigour. For myself I can\r\ntruly say that my strongest feeling is for their wretchedness.\r\n\r\nThe father and son had more than once boasted among themselves that\r\nthe game they were now playing was a high one; that they were, in\r\nfact, gambling for mighty stakes. And in truth, as long as the\r\nmoney came in to them--flowing in as the result of their own craft\r\nin this game--the excitement had about it something that was very\r\npleasurable. There was danger, which makes all games pleasant; there\r\nwas money in handfuls for daily expenses--those daily wants of the\r\nappetite, which are to such men more important by far than the\r\ndistant necessities of life; there was a possibility of future\r\ngrandeur, an opening out of magnificent ideas of fortune, which\r\ncharmed them greatly as they thought about it. What might they not\r\ndo with forty thousand pounds divided between them, or even with a\r\nthousand a year each, settled on them for life? and surely their\r\nsecret was worth that money! Nay, was it not palpable to the meanest\r\ncalculation that it was worth much more? Had they not the selling\r\nof twelve thousand a year for ever and ever to this family of\r\nFitzgerald?\r\n\r\nBut for the last fortnight things had begun to go astray with them.\r\nMoney easily come by goes easily, and money badly come by goes badly.\r\nTheirs had come easily and badly, and had so gone. What necessity\r\ncould there be for economy with such a milch-cow as that close to\r\ntheir elbows? So both of them had thought, if not argued; and there\r\nhad been no economy--no economy in the use of that very costly\r\namusement, the dice-box; and now, at the present moment, ready money\r\nhaving failed to be the result of either of the two last visits to\r\nCastle Richmond, the family funds were running low.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that ready money for the moment was the one desire\r\nnearest to the heart of Mollett p\xe8re, when he took that last journey\r\nover the Boggeragh mountains--ready money wherewith to satisfy the\r\npressing claims of Miss O\'Dwyer, and bring back civility, or rather\r\nservility, to the face and manner of Tom the waiter at the Kanturk\r\nHotel. Very little of that servility can be enjoyed by persons of\r\nthe Mollett class when money ceases to be ready in their hands and\r\npockets, and there is, perhaps, nothing that they enjoy so keenly as\r\nservility. Mollett p\xe8re had gone down determined that that comfort\r\nshould at any rate be forthcoming to him, whatever answer might\r\nbe given to those other grander demands, and we know what success\r\nhad attended his mission. He had looked to find his tame milch-cow\r\ntrembling in her accustomed stall, and he had found a resolute bull\r\nthere in her place--a bull whom he could by no means take by the\r\nhorns. He had got no money, and before he had reached Cork he had\r\nbegun to comprehend that it was not probable that he should get more\r\nfrom that source.\r\n\r\nDuring a part of the interview between him and Mr. Prendergast, some\r\nspark of mercy towards his victims had glimmered into his heart. When\r\nit was explained to him that the game was to be given up, that the\r\nfamily at Castle Richmond was prepared to acknowledge the truth, and\r\nthat the effort made was with the view of proving that the poor lady\r\nup stairs was not entitled to the name she bore rather than that she\r\nwas so entitled, then some slight promptings of a better spirit did\r\nfor a while tempt him to be merciful. "Oh, what are you about to do?"\r\nhe would have said had Mr. Prendergast admitted of speech from him.\r\n"Why make this terrible sacrifice? Matters have not come to that.\r\nThere is no need for you to drag to the light this terrible fact. I\r\nwill not divulge it--no not although you are hard upon me in regard\r\nto these terms of mine. I will still keep it to myself, and trust\r\nto you,--to you who are all so rich and able to pay, for what\r\nconsideration you may please to give me." This was the state of his\r\nmind when Mrs. Jones\'s evidence was being slowly evoked from her;\r\nbut it had undergone a considerable change before he reached Cork.\r\nBy that time he had taught himself to understand that there was no\r\nlonger a chance to him of any consideration whatever. Slowly he\r\nhad brought it home to himself that these people had resolutely\r\ndetermined to blow up the ground on which they themselves stood. This\r\nhe perceived was their honesty. He did not understand the nature of a\r\nfeeling which could induce so fatal a suicide, but he did understand\r\nthat the feeling was there, and that the suicide would be completed.\r\n\r\nAnd now what was he to do next in the way of earning his\r\nbread? Various thoughts ran through his brain, and different\r\nresolves--half-formed but still, perhaps, capable of shape--presented\r\nthemselves to him for the future. It was still on the cards--on the\r\ncards, but barely so--that he might make money out of these people;\r\nbut he must wait perhaps for weeks before he again commenced such an\r\nattempt. He might perhaps make money out of them, and be merciful to\r\nthem at the same time;--not money by thousands and tens of thousands;\r\nthat golden dream was gone for ever; but still money that might be\r\ncomfortably luxurious as long as it could be made to last. But then\r\non one special point he made a firm and final resolution,--whatever\r\nnew scheme he might hatch he alone would manage. Never again would he\r\ncall into his councils that son of his loins whose rapacious greed\r\nhad, as he felt sure, brought upon him all this ruin. Had Aby not\r\ngone to Castle Richmond, with his cruelty and his greed, frightening\r\nto the very death the soul of that poor baronet by the enormity of\r\nhis demands, Mr. Prendergast would not have been there. Of what\r\nfurther chance of Castle Richmond pickings there might be Aby should\r\nknow nothing. He and his son would no longer hunt in couples. He\r\nwould shake him off in that escape which they must both now make from\r\nCork, and he would not care how long it might be before he again saw\r\nhis countenance.\r\n\r\nBut then that question of ready money; and that other question,\r\nperhaps as interesting, touching a criminal prosecution! How was he\r\nto escape if he could not raise the wind? And how could he raise\r\nthe wind now that his milch-cow had run so dry? He had promised the\r\nO\'Dwyers money that evening, and had struggled hard to make that\r\npromise with an easy face. He now had none to give them. His orders\r\nat the inn were treated almost with contempt. For the last three days\r\nthey had given him what he wanted to eat and drink, but would hardly\r\ngive him all that he wanted. When he called for brandy they brought\r\nhim whisky, and it had only been by hard begging, and by oaths as to\r\nthe promised money, that he had induced them to supply him with the\r\ncar which had taken him on his fruitless journey to Castle Richmond.\r\nAs he was driven up to the door in South Main Street, his heart was\r\nvery sad on all these subjects.\r\n\r\nAby was again sitting within the bar, but was no longer basking in\r\nthe sunshine of Fanny\'s smiles. He was sitting there because Fanny\r\nhad not yet mustered courage to turn him out. He was half-drunk, for\r\nit had been found impossible to keep spirits from him. And there had\r\nbeen hot words between him and Fanny, in which she had twitted him\r\nwith his unpaid bill, and he had twitted her with her former love.\r\nAnd things had gone from bad to worse, and she had all but called\r\nin Tom for aid in getting quit of him; she had, however, refrained,\r\nthinking of the money that might be coming, and waiting also till her\r\nfather should arrive. Fanny\'s love for Mr. Abraham Mollett had not\r\nbeen long lived.\r\n\r\nI will not describe another scene such as those which had of late\r\nbeen frequent in the Kanturk Hotel. The father and the son soon found\r\nthemselves together in the small room in which they now both slept,\r\nat the top of the house; and Aby, tipsy as he was, understood the\r\nwhole of what had happened at Castle Richmond. When he heard that\r\nMr. Prendergast was seen in that room in lieu of Sir Thomas, he knew\r\nat once that the game had been abandoned. "But something may yet be\r\ndone at \'Appy \'ouse," Aby said to himself, "only one must be deuced\r\nquick."\r\n\r\nThe father and the son of course quarrelled frightfully, like dogs\r\nover the memory of a bone which had been arrested from the jaws of\r\nboth of them. Aby said that his father had lost everything by his\r\npusillanimity, and old Mollett declared that his son had destroyed\r\nall by his rashness. But we need not repeat their quarrels, nor\r\nrepeat all that passed between them and Tom before food was\r\nforthcoming to satisfy the old man\'s wants. As he ate he calculated\r\nhow much he might probably raise upon his watch towards taking him to\r\nLondon, and how best he might get off from Cork without leaving any\r\nscent in the nostrils of his son. His clothes he must leave behind\r\nhim at the inn, at least all that he could not pack upon his person.\r\nLately he had made himself comfortable in this respect, and he\r\nsorrowed over the fine linen which he had worn but once or twice\r\nsince it had been bought with the last instalment from Sir Thomas.\r\nNevertheless in this way he did make up his mind for the morrow\'s\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAnd Aby also made up his mind. Something at any rate he had learned\r\nfrom Fanny O\'Dwyer in return for his honeyed words. When Herbert\r\nFitzgerald should cease to be the heir to Castle Richmond, Owen\r\nFitzgerald of Hap House would be the happy man. That knowledge was\r\nhis own in absolute independence of his father, and there might still\r\nbe time for him to use it. He knew well the locality of Hap House,\r\nand he would be there early on the following morning. These tidings\r\nhad probably not as yet reached the owner of that blessed abode, and\r\nif he could be the first to tell him--! The game there too might be\r\npretty enough, if it were played well, by such a master-hand as his\r\nown. Yes; he would be at Hap House early in the morning;--but then,\r\nhow to get there?\r\n\r\nHe left his father preparing for bed, and going down into the bar\r\nfound Mr. O\'Dwyer and his daughter there in close consultation.\r\nThey were endeavouring to arrive, by their joint wisdom, at some\r\nconclusion as to what they should do with their two guests. Fanny\r\nwas for turning them out at once. "The first loss is the least,"\r\nsaid she. "And they is so disrispectable. I niver know what they\'re\r\nafther, and always is expecting the p\'lice will be down on them."\r\nBut the father shook his head. He had done nothing wrong; the police\r\ncould not hurt him; and thirty pounds, as he told his daughter, with\r\nmuch emphasis, was "a deuced sight of money." "The first loss is\r\nthe least," said Fanny, perseveringly; and then Aby entered to them.\r\n\r\n"My father has made a mull of this matter again," said he, going at\r\nonce into the middle of the subject. "\'E \'as come back without a\r\nshiner."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound he has," said Mr. O\'Dwyer, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n"And that when \'e\'d only got to go two or three miles further, and\r\nhall his troubles would have been over."\r\n\r\n"Troubles over, would they?" said Fanny. "I wish he\'d have the\r\ngoodness to get over his little troubles in this house, by paying us\r\nour bill. You\'ll have to walk if it\'s not done, and that to-morrow,\r\nMr. Mollett; and so I tell you; and take nothing with you, I can tell\r\nyou. Father \'ll have the police to see to that."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you be so cruel now, Miss Fanny," said Aby, with a leering\r\nlook. "I tell you what it is, Mr. O\'Dwyer, I must go down again to\r\nthem diggings very early to-morrow, starting, say, at four o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll not have a foot out of my stables," said Mr. O\'Dwyer. "That\'s\r\nall."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Mr. O\'Dwyer; there\'s been a sight of money due to us from\r\nthose Fitzgerald people down there. You know \'em; and whether they\'re\r\nhable to pay or not. I won\'t deny but what father\'s \'ad the best of\r\nit,--\'ad the best of it, and sent it trolling, bad luck to him. But\r\nthere\'s no good looking hafter spilt milk; is there?"\r\n\r\n"If so be that Sir Thomas owed the likes of you money, he would have\r\npaid it without your tramping down there time after time to look for\r\nit. He\'s not one of that sort."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," said Fanny; "and I don\'t believe anything about your\r\nseeing Sir Thomas."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ve seed him hoften enough. There\'s no mistake about that. But\r\nnow--" and then, with a mysterious air and low voice, he explained\r\nto them, that this considerable balance of money still due to\r\nthem was to be paid by the cousin, "Mr. Owen of Appy \'ouse." And\r\nto substantiate all his story, he exhibited a letter from Mr.\r\nPrendergast to his father, which some months since had intimated that\r\na sum of money would be paid on behalf of Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, if\r\nMr. Mollett would call at Mr. Prendergast\'s office at a certain hour.\r\nThe ultimate effect of all this was, that the car was granted for\r\nthe morning, with certain dire threats as to any further breach of\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nVery early on the following morning Aby was astir, hoping that he\r\nmight manage to complete his not elaborate toilet without disturbing\r\nhis father\'s slumbers. For, it must be known, he had been very urgent\r\nwith the O\'Dwyers as to the necessity of keeping this journey of\r\nhis a secret from his "governor." But the governor was wide awake,\r\nlooking at him out of the corner of his closed eye whenever his back\r\nwas turned, and not caring much what he was about to do with himself.\r\nMollett p\xe8re wished to be left alone for that morning, that he also\r\nmight play his little game in his own solitary fashion, and was not\r\nat all disposed to question the movements of his son.\r\n\r\nAt about five Aby started for Hap House. His toilet, I have said, was\r\nnot elaborate; but in this I have perhaps wronged him. Up there in\r\nthe bed-room he did not waste much time over his soap and water; but\r\nhe was aware that first impressions are everything, and that one\r\nyoung man should appear smart and clever before another if he wished\r\nto carry any effect with him; so he took his brush and comb in his\r\npocket, and a pot of grease with which he was wont to polish his long\r\nside-locks, and he hurriedly grasped up his pins, and his rings, and\r\nthe satin stock which Fanny in her kinder mood had folded for him;\r\nand then, during his long journey to Hap House, he did perform a\r\ntoilet which may, perhaps, be fairly called elaborate.\r\n\r\nThere was a long, tortuous, narrow avenue, going from the Mallow\r\nand Kanturk road down to Hap House, which impressed Aby with the\r\nidea that the man on whom he was now about to call was also a big\r\ngentleman, and made him more uneasy than he would have been had he\r\nentered a place with less pretence. There is a story current, that\r\nin the west of England the grandeur of middle-aged maiden ladies\r\nis measured by the length of the tail of their cats; and Aby had a\r\nperhaps equally correct idea, that the length of the private drive up\r\nto a gentleman\'s house, was a fair criterion of the splendour of his\r\nposition. If this man had about him as much grandeur as Sir Thomas\r\nhimself, would he be so anxious as Aby had hoped to obtain the\r\nadditional grandeur of Sir Thomas? It was in that direction that his\r\nmind was operating when he got down from the car and rang at the\r\ndoor-bell.\r\n\r\nMr. Owen, as everybody called him, was at home, but not down; and\r\nso Aby was shown into the dining-room. It was now considerably past\r\nnine; and the servant told him that his master must be there soon, as\r\nhe had to eat his breakfast and be at the hunt by eleven. The servant\r\nat Hap House was more unsophisticated than those at Castle Richmond,\r\nand Aby\'s personal adornments had had their effect. He found himself\r\nsitting in the room with the cups and saucers,--aye, and with the\r\nsilver tea-spoons; and began again to trust that his mission might be\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAnd then the door opened, and a man appeared, clad from top to toe in\r\nhunting costume. This was not Owen Fitzgerald, but his friend Captain\r\nDonnellan. As it had happened, Captain Donnellan was the only guest\r\nwho had graced the festivities of Hap House on the previous evening;\r\nand now he appeared at the breakfast table before his host. Aby got\r\nup from his chair when the gentleman entered, and was proceeding to\r\nbusiness; but the Captain gave him to understand that the master of\r\nthe house was not yet in presence, and so Aby sat down again. What\r\nwas he to do when the master did arrive? His story was not one which\r\nwould well bear telling before a third person.\r\n\r\nAnd then, while Captain Donnellan was scanning this visitor to\r\nhis friend Owen, and bethinking himself whether he might not be a\r\nsheriff\'s officer, and whether if so some notice ought not to be\r\nconveyed up stairs to the master of the house, another car was driven\r\nup to the front door. In this case the arrival was from Castle\r\nRichmond, and the two servants knew each other well. "Thady," said\r\nRichard, with much authority in his voice, "this gentl\'man is Mr.\r\nPrendergast from our place, and he must see the masther before he\r\ngoes to the hunt." "Faix and the masther \'ll have something to do\r\nthis blessed morning," said Thady, as he showed Mr. Prendergast also\r\ninto the dining-room, and went up stairs to inform his master that\r\nthere was yet another gentleman come upon business. "The Captain has\r\ngot \'em both to hisself," said Thady, as he closed the door.\r\n\r\nThe name of Mr. "Pendhrergrast," as the Irish servants generally\r\ncalled him, was quite unknown to the owner of Hap House, as was also\r\nthat of Mr. Mollett, which had been brought up to him the first of\r\nthe two; but Owen began to think that there must be something very\r\nunusual in a day so singularly ushered in to him. Callers at Hap\r\nHouse on business were very few, unless when tradesmen in want of\r\nmoney occasionally dropped in upon him. But now that he was so\r\nsummoned Owen began to bestir himself with his boots and breeches.\r\nA gentleman\'s costume for a hunting morning is always a slow\r\none--sometimes so slow and tedious as to make him think of\r\nforswearing such articles of dress for all future ages. But now he\r\ndid bestir himself,--in a moody melancholy sort of manner; for his\r\nmanner in all things latterly had become moody and melancholy.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Captain Donnellan and the two strangers sat almost\r\nin silence in the dining-room. The Captain, though he did not perhaps\r\nknow much of things noticeable in this world, did know something of\r\na gentleman, and was therefore not led away, as poor Thady had been,\r\nby Aby\'s hat and rings. He had stared Aby full in the face when he\r\nentered the room, and having explained that he was not the master\r\nof the house, had not vouchsafed another word. But then he had also\r\nseen that Mr. Prendergast was of a different class, and had said a\r\ncivil word or two, asking him to come near the fire, and suggesting\r\nthat Owen would be down in less than five minutes. "But the old cock\r\nwouldn\'t crow," as he afterwards remarked to his friend, and so they\r\nall three sat in silence, the Captain being very busy about his\r\nknees, as hunting gentlemen sometimes are when they come down to\r\nbachelor breakfasts.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last Owen Fitzgerald entered the room. He has been\r\ndescribed as a handsome man, but in no dress did he look so well as\r\nwhen equipped for a day\'s sport. And what dress that Englishmen ever\r\nwear is so handsome as this? Or we may perhaps say what other dress\r\ndoes English custom allow them that is in any respect not the reverse\r\nof handsome. We have come to be so dingy,--in our taste I was going\r\nto say, but it is rather in our want of taste,--so careless of any of\r\nthe laws of beauty in the folds and lines and hues of our dress, so\r\nopposed to grace in the arrangement of our persons, that it is not\r\npermitted to the ordinary English gentleman to be anything else but\r\nugly. Chimney-pot hats, swallow-tailed coats, and pantaloons that fit\r\nnothing, came creeping in upon us, one after the other, while the\r\nGeorges reigned--creeping in upon us with such pictures as we painted\r\nunder the reign of West, and such houses as we built under the reign\r\nof Nash, till the English eye required to rest on that which was\r\nconstrained, dull, and graceless. For the last two score of years\r\nit has come to this, that if a man go in handsome attire he is a\r\npopinjay and a vain fool; and as it is better to be ugly than to be\r\naccounted vain I would not counsel a young friend to leave the beaten\r\ntrack on the strength of his own judgment. But not the less is the\r\nbeaten track to be condemned, and abandoned, and abolished, if such\r\nbe in any way possible. Beauty is good in all things; and I cannot\r\nbut think that those old Venetian senators, and Florentine men of\r\nCouncil, owed somewhat of their country\'s pride and power to the\r\nmanner in which they clipped their beards and wore their flowing\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nBut an Englishman may still make himself brave when he goes forth\r\ninto the hunting field. Custom there allows him colour, and garments\r\nthat fit his limbs. Strength is the outward characteristic of\r\nmanhood, and at the covert-side he may appear strong. Look at men as\r\nthey walk along Fleet-street, and ask yourself whether any outward\r\nsign of manhood or strength can be seen there. And of gentle manhood\r\noutward dignity should be the trade mark. I will not say that such\r\noutward dignity is incompatible with a black hat and plaid trousers,\r\nfor the eye instructed by habit will search out dignity for itself\r\nwherever it may truly exist, let it be hidden by what vile covering\r\nit may. But any man who can look well at his club, will look better\r\nas he clusters round the hounds; while many a one who is comely\r\nthere, is mean enough as he stands on the hearth-rug before his club\r\nfire. In my mind men, like churches and books, and women too, should\r\nbe brave, not mean, in their outward garniture.\r\n\r\nAnd Owen, as I have said, was brave as he walked into his\r\ndining-room. The sorrow which weighed on his heart had not wrinkled\r\nhis brow, but had given him a set dignity of purpose. His tall\r\nfigure, which his present dress allowed to be seen, was perfect in\r\nits symmetry of strength. His bright chestnut hair clustered round\r\nhis forehead, and his eye shone like that of a hawk. They must have\r\nbeen wrong who said that he commonly spent his nights over the\r\nwine-cup. That pleasure always leaves its disgusting traces round the\r\nlips; and Owen Fitzgerald\'s lips were as full and lusty as Apollo\'s.\r\nMollett, as he saw him, was stricken with envy. "If I could only get\r\nenough money out of this affair to look like that," was his first\r\nthought, as his eye fell on the future heir; not understanding, poor\r\nwretch that he was, that all the gold of California could not bring\r\nhim one inch nearer to the goal he aimed at. I think I have said\r\nbefore, that your silk purse will not get itself made out of that\r\ncoarse material with which there are so many attempts to manufacture\r\nthat article. And Mr. Prendergast rose from his chair when he saw\r\nhim, with a respect that was almost involuntary. He had not heard\r\nmen speak well of Owen Fitzgerald;--not that ill-natured things had\r\nbeen said by the family at Castle Richmond, but circumstances had\r\nprevented the possibility of their praising him. If a relative or\r\nfriend be spoken of without praise, he is, in fact, censured. From\r\nwhat he had heard he had certainly not expected a man who would look\r\nso noble as did the owner of Hap House, who now came forward to ask\r\nhim his business.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Prendergast and Aby Mollett rose at the same time. Since the\r\narrival of the latter gentleman, Aby had been wondering who he might\r\nbe, but no idea that he was that lawyer from Castle Richmond had\r\nentered his head. That he was a stranger like himself, Aby saw; but\r\nhe did not connect him with his own business. Indeed he had not\r\nyet realized the belief, though his father had done so, that the\r\ntruth would be revealed by those at Castle Richmond to him at Hap\r\nHouse. His object now was that the old gentleman should say his say\r\nand begone, leaving him to dispose of the other young man in the\r\ntop-boots as best he might. But then, as it happened, that was also\r\nMr. Prendergast\'s line of action.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said Owen, "I beg your pardon for keeping you waiting;\r\nbut the fact is that I am so seldom honoured in this way in a\r\nmorning, that I was hardly ready. Donnellan, there\'s the tea; don\'t\r\nmind waiting. These gentlemen will perhaps join us." And then he\r\nlooked hard at Aby, as though he trusted in Providence that no such\r\nprofanation would be done to his table-cloth.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I have breakfasted," said Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\n"And so \'ave I," said Aby, who had eaten a penny loaf in the car, and\r\nwould have been delighted to sit down at that rich table. But he was\r\na little beside himself, and not able to pluck up courage for such an\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether you two gentlemen have come about the same\r\nbusiness," said Owen, looking from one to the other.\r\n\r\n"No," said Mr. Prendergast, very confidently, but not very correctly.\r\n"I wish to speak to you, Mr. Fitzgerald, for a few minutes: but my\r\nbusiness with you is quite private."\r\n\r\n"So is mine," said Aby, "very private; very private indeed."\r\n\r\n"Well, gentlemen, I have just half an hour in which to eat my\r\nbreakfast, attend to business, get on my horse and leave the house.\r\nOut of that twenty-five minutes are very much at your service.\r\nDonnellan, I beg your pardon. Do pitch into the broiled bones while\r\nthey are hot; never mind me. And now, gentlemen, if you will walk\r\nwith me into the other room. First come first served: that I suppose\r\nshould be the order." And he opened the door and stood with it ajar\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n"I will wait, Mr. Fitzgerald, if you please," said Mr. Prendergast;\r\nand as he spoke he motioned Mollett with his hand to go to the door.\r\n\r\n"Oh! I can wait, sir; I\'d rather wait, sir. I would indeed," said\r\nAby. "My business is a little particular; and if you\'ll go on, sir,\r\nI\'ll take up with the gen\'leman as soon as you\'ve done, sir."\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Prendergast was accustomed to have his own way. "I should\r\nprefer that you should go first, sir. And to tell the truth, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald, what I have to say to you will take some time. It is of\r\nmuch importance, to yourself and to others; and I fear that you will\r\nprobably find that it will detain you from your amusement to-day."\r\n\r\nOwen looked black as he heard this. The hounds were going to draw\r\na covert of his own; and he was not in the habit of remaining away\r\nfrom the drawing of any coverts, belonging to himself or others,\r\non any provocation whatever. "That will be rather hard," said he,\r\n"considering that I do not know any more than the man in the moon\r\nwhat you\'ve come about."\r\n\r\n"You shall be the sole judge yourself, sir, of the importance of my\r\nbusiness with you," said Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr.-- I forget your name," said Owen.\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Mollett," said Aby. Whereupon Mr. Prendergast looked up\r\nat him very sharply, but he said nothing.--He said nothing, but\r\nhe looked very sharply indeed. He now knew well who this man was,\r\nand guessed with tolerable accuracy the cause of his visit. But,\r\nnevertheless, at the moment he said nothing.\r\n\r\n"Come along, then, Mr. Mollett. I hope your affair is not likely to\r\nbe a very long one also. Perhaps you\'ll excuse my having a cup of tea\r\nsent in to me as you talk to me. There is nothing like saving time\r\nwhen such very important business is on the tapis. Donnellan, send\r\nThady in with a cup of tea, like a good fellow. Now, Mr. Mollett."\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett rose slowly from his chair, and followed his host. He\r\nwould have given all he possessed in the world, and that was very\r\nlittle, to have had the coast clear. But in such an emergency,\r\nwhat was he to do? By the time he had reached the door of the\r\ndrawing-room, he had all but made up his mind to tell Fitzgerald\r\nthat, seeing there was so much other business on hand this morning at\r\nHap House, this special piece of business of his must stand over. But\r\nthen, how could he go back to Cork empty-handed? So he followed Owen\r\ninto the room, and there opened his budget with what courage he had\r\nleft to him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Donnellan, as he employed himself on the broiled bones,\r\ntwice invited Mr. Prendergast to assist him; but in vain. Donnellan\r\nremained there, waiting for Owen, till eleven; and then got on his\r\nhorse. "You\'ll tell Fitzgerald, will you, that I\'ve started? He\'ll\r\nsee nothing of to-day\'s hunt; that\'s clear."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he will," said Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nAFTER BREAKFAST AT HAP HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think he will," said Mr. Prendergast; and as he spoke,\r\nCaptain Donnellan\'s ear could detect that there was something\r\napproaching to sarcasm in the tone of the old man\'s voice. The\r\nCaptain was quite sure that his friend would not be even at the heel\r\nof the hunt that day; and without further compunction proceeded to\r\nfasten his buckskin gloves round his wrists. The meet was so near\r\nto them, that they had both intended to ride their own hunters from\r\nthe door; and the two nags were now being led up and down upon the\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment a terrible noise was heard to take place in\r\nthe hall. There was a rush and crushing there which made even Mr.\r\nPrendergast to jump from his chair, and drove Captain Donnellan to\r\nforget his gloves and run to the door.\r\n\r\nIt was as though all the winds of heaven were being driven down the\r\npassage, and as though each separate wind was shod with heavy-heeled\r\nboots. Captain Donnellan ran to the door, and Mr. Prendergast with\r\nslower steps followed him. When it was opened, Owen was to be seen\r\nin the hall, apparently in a state of great excitement; and the\r\ngentleman whom he had lately asked to breakfast,--he was to be seen\r\nalso, in a position of unmistakeable discomfort. He was at that\r\nmoment proceeding, with the utmost violence, into a large round bed\r\nof bushes, which stood in the middle of the great sweep before the\r\ndoor of the house, his feet just touching the ground as he went; and\r\nthen, having reached his bourne, he penetrated face foremost into the\r\nthicket, and in an instant disappeared. He had been kicked out of the\r\nhouse. Owen Fitzgerald had taken him by the shoulders, with a run\r\nalong the passage and hall, and having reached the door, had applied\r\nthe flat of his foot violently to poor Aby\'s back, and sent him\r\nflying down the stone steps. And now, as Captain Donnellan and Mr.\r\nPrendergast stood looking on, Mr. Mollett junior buried himself\r\naltogether out of sight among the shrubs.\r\n\r\n"You have done for that fellow, at any rate, Owen," said Captain\r\nDonnellan, glancing for a moment at Mr. Prendergast. "I should say\r\nthat he will never get out of that alive."\r\n\r\n"Not if he wait till I pick him out," said Owen, breathing very hard\r\nafter his exertion. "An infernal scoundrel! And now, Mr. Prendergast,\r\nif you are ready, sir, I am." It was as much as he could do to finish\r\nthese few words with that sang froid which he desired to assume, so\r\nviolent was his attempt at breathing after his late exercise.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to conceive the idea that, as one disagreeable\r\nvisitor had been disposed of in a somewhat summary fashion, so might\r\nbe the other also. Mr. Prendergast did not look like a man who was\r\nin the habit of leaving gentlemen\'s houses in the manner just now\r\nadopted by Mr. Mollett; but nevertheless, as they had come together,\r\nboth unwished for and unwelcome, Captain Donnellan did for a moment\r\nbethink himself whether there might not be more of such fun, if he\r\nremained there on the spot. At any rate, it would not do for him to\r\ngo to the hunt while such deeds as these were being done. It might be\r\nthat his assistance would be wanted.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast smiled, with a saturnine and somewhat bitter\r\nsmile--the nearest approach to a laugh in which he was known to\r\nindulge,--for the same notion came also into his head. "He has\r\ndisposed of him, and now he is thinking how he will dispose of me."\r\nSuch was Mr. Prendergast\'s thought about the matter; and that made\r\nhim smile. And then, too, he was pleased at what he had seen. That\r\nthis Mollett was the son of that other Mollett, with whom he had been\r\ncloseted at Castle Richmond, was plain enough; it was plain enough\r\nalso to him, used as he was to trace out in his mind the courses of\r\naction which men would follow, that Mollett junior, having heard of\r\nhis father\'s calamitous failure at Castle Richmond, had come down to\r\nHap House to see what he could make out of the hitherto unconscious\r\nheir. It had been matter of great doubt with Mr. Prendergast, when he\r\nfirst heard young Mollett\'s name mentioned, whether or no he would\r\nallow him to make his attempt. He, Mr. Prendergast, could by a word\r\nhave spoilt the game; but acting, as he was forced to act, on the\r\nspur of the moment, he resolved to permit Mr. Mollett junior to play\r\nout his play. He would be yet in time to prevent any ill result to\r\nMr. Fitzgerald, should that gentleman be weak enough to succumb to\r\nany such ill results. As things had now turned out Mr. Prendergast\r\nrejoiced that Mr. Mollett junior had been permitted to play out his\r\nplay. "And now, Mr. Prendergast, if you are ready, I am," said Owen.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we had better first pick up the gentleman among the trees,"\r\nsaid Mr. Prendergast. And he and Captain Donnellan went down into the\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\n"Do as you please about that," said Owen. "I have touched him once\r\nand shall not touch him again." And he walked back into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nOne of the grooms who were leading the horses had now gone to the\r\nassistance of the fallen hero; and as Captain Donnellan also had\r\nalready penetrated as far as Aby\'s shoulders, Mr. Prendergast,\r\nthinking that he was not needed, returned also to the house. "I hope\r\nhe is not seriously hurt," he said.\r\n\r\n"Not he," said Owen. "Those sort of men are as used to be kicked,\r\nas girls are to be kissed; and it comes as naturally to them. But\r\nanything short of having his bones broken will be less than he\r\ndeserves."\r\n\r\n"May I ask what was the nature of his offence?"\r\n\r\nOwen remained silent for a moment, looking his guest full in the\r\nface. "Well; not exactly," said he. "He has been talking of people of\r\nwhom he knows nothing, but it would not be well for me to repeat what\r\nhe has said to a perfect stranger."\r\n\r\n"Quite right, Mr. Fitzgerald; it would not be well. But there can be\r\nno harm in my repeating it to you. He came here to get money from you\r\nfor certain tidings which he brought; tidings which if true would be\r\nof great importance to you. As I take it, however, he has altogether\r\nfailed in his object."\r\n\r\n"And how do you come to know all this, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Merely from having heard that man mention his own name. I also\r\nhave come with the same tidings; and as I ask for no money for\r\ncommunicating them, you may believe them to be true on my telling."\r\n\r\n"What tidings?" asked Owen, with a frown, and an angry jerk in his\r\nvoice. No remotest notion had yet come in upon his mind that there\r\nwas any truth in the story that had been told him. He had looked upon\r\nit all as a lie, and had regarded Mollett as a sorry knave who had\r\ncome to him with a poor and low attempt at raising a few pounds. And\r\neven now he did not believe. Mr. Prendergast\'s words had been too\r\nsudden to produce belief of so great a fact, and his first thought\r\nwas that an endeavour was being made to fool him.\r\n\r\n"Those tidings which that man has told you," said Mr. Prendergast,\r\nsolemnly. "That you should not have believed them from him shows only\r\nyour discretion. But from me you may believe them. I have come from\r\nCastle Richmond, and am here as a messenger from Sir Thomas,--from\r\nSir Thomas and from his son. When the matter became clear to them\r\nboth, then it was felt that you also should be made acquainted with\r\nit."\r\n\r\nOwen Fitzgerald now sat down, and looked up into the lawyer\'s face,\r\nstaring at him. I may say that the power of saying much was for the\r\nmoment taken away from him by the words that he heard. What! was it\r\nreally possible that that title, that property, that place of honour\r\nin the country was to be his when one frail old man should drop away?\r\nAnd then again was it really true that all this immeasurable misery\r\nwas to fall--had fallen--upon that family whom he had once known so\r\nwell? It was but yesterday that he had been threatening all manner\r\nof evil to his cousin Herbert; and had his threats been proved true\r\nso quickly? But there was no shadow of triumph in his feelings.\r\nOwen Fitzgerald was a man of many faults. He was reckless,\r\npassionate, prone to depreciate the opinion of others, extravagant\r\nin his thoughts and habits, ever ready to fight, both morally and\r\nphysically, those who did not at a moment\'s notice agree with him.\r\nHe was a man who would at once make up his mind that the world was\r\nwrong when the world condemned him, and who would not in compliance\r\nwith any argument allow himself to be so. But he was not avaricious,\r\nnor cruel, nor self-seeking, nor vindictive. In his anger he could\r\npronounce all manner of ill things against his enemy, as he had\r\npronounced some ill things against Herbert; but it was not in him to\r\nkeep up a sustained wish that those ill things should really come to\r\npass. This news which he now heard, and which he did not yet fully\r\ncredit, struck him with awe, but created no triumph in his bosom.\r\nHe realized the catastrophe as it affected his cousins of Castle\r\nRichmond rather than as it affected himself.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that Lady Fitzgerald--" and then he stopped\r\nhimself. He had not the courage to ask the question which was in his\r\nmind. Could it really be the case that Lady Fitzgerald,--that she\r\nwhom all the world had so long honoured under that name, was in truth\r\nthe wife of that man\'s father,--of the father of that wretch whom\r\nhe had just spurned from his house? The tragedy was so deep that he\r\ncould not believe in it.\r\n\r\n"We fear that it is so, Mr. Fitzgerald," said Mr. Prendergast. "That\r\nit certainly is so I cannot say. And therefore, if I may take the\r\nliberty to give you counsel, I would advise you not to make too\r\ncertain of this change in your prospects."\r\n\r\n"Too certain!" said he, with a bitter laugh. "Do you suppose then\r\nthat I would wish to see all this ruin accomplished? Heavens and\r\nearth! Lady Fitzgerald--! I cannot believe it."\r\n\r\nAnd then Captain Donnellan also returned to the room. "Fitzgerald,"\r\nsaid he, "what the mischief are we to do with this fellow? He says\r\nthat he can\'t walk, and he bleeds from his face like a pig."\r\n\r\n"What fellow? Oh, do what you like with him. Here: give him a pound\r\nnote, and let him go to the d----. And Donnellan, for heaven\'s sake\r\ngo to Cecilstown at once. Do not wait for me. I have business that\r\nwill keep me here all day."\r\n\r\n"But I do not know what to do with this fellow that\'s bleeding," said\r\nthe captain, piteously, as he took the proffered note. "If he puts up\r\nwith a pound note for what you\'ve done to him, he\'s softer than what\r\nI take him for."\r\n\r\n"He will be very glad to be allowed to escape without being given up\r\nto the police," said Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know what to do with him," said Captain Donnellan. "He\r\nsays that he can\'t stand."\r\n\r\n"Then lay him down on the dunghill," said Owen Fitzgerald; "but\r\nfor heaven\'s sake do not let him interrupt me. And, Donnellan, you\r\nwill altogether lose the day if you stay any longer." Whereupon\r\nthe captain, seeing that in very truth he was not wanted, did take\r\nhimself off, casting as he went one farewell look on Aby as he lay\r\ngroaning on the turf on the far side of the tuft of bushes.\r\n\r\n"He\'s kilt intirely, I\'m thinking, yer honor," said Thady, who was\r\nstanding over him on the other side.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll come to life again before dinner-time," said the Captain.\r\n\r\n"Oh, in course he\'ll do that, yer honor," said Thady; and then added\r\nsotto voce, to himself, as the captain rode down the avenue, "Faix,\r\nan\' I don\'t know about that. Shure an\' it\'s the masther has a heavy\r\nhand." And then Thady stood for a while perplexed, endeavouring to\r\nreanimate Aby by a sight of the pound note which he held out visibly\r\nbetween his thumb and fingers.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mr. Prendergast and Owen were again alone. "And what am I to\r\ndo?" said Owen, after a pause of a minute or two; and he asked the\r\nquestion with a serious solemn voice.\r\n\r\n"Just for the present--for the next day or two--I think that you\r\nshould do nothing. As soon as the first agony of this time is over\r\nat Castle Richmond, I think that Herbert should see you. It would\r\nbe very desirable that he and you should take in concert such\r\nproceedings as will certainly become necessary. The absolute proof of\r\nthe truth of this story must be obtained. You understand, I hope, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald, that the case still admits of doubt."\r\n\r\nOwen nodded his head impatiently, as though it were needless on the\r\npart of Mr. Prendergast to insist upon this. He did not wish to take\r\nit for true a moment sooner than was necessary.\r\n\r\n"It is my duty to give you this caution. Many lawyers--I presume you\r\nknow that I am a lawyer--"\r\n\r\n"I did not know it," said Owen; "but it makes no difference."\r\n\r\n"Thank you; that\'s very kind," said Mr. Prendergast; but the sarcasm\r\nwas altogether lost upon his hearer. "Some lawyers, as I was saying,\r\nwould in such a case have advised their clients to keep all their\r\nsuspicions, nay all their knowledge, to themselves. Why play the game\r\nof an adversary? they would ask. But I have thought it better that we\r\nshould have no adversary."\r\n\r\n"And you will have none," said Owen; "none in me at least."\r\n\r\n"I am much gratified in so perceiving, and in having such evidence\r\nthat my advice has not been indiscreet. It occurred to me that if\r\nyou received the first intimation of these circumstances from other\r\nsources, you would be bound on your own behalf to employ an agent to\r\nlook after your own interests."\r\n\r\n"I should have done nothing of the kind," said Owen.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but, my dear young friend, in such a case it would have been\r\nyour duty to do so."\r\n\r\n"Then I should have neglected my duty. And do you tell Herbert this\r\nfrom me, that let the truth be what it may, I shall never interrupt\r\nhim in his title or his property. It is not there that I shall look\r\neither for justice or revenge. He will understand what I mean."\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Prendergast did not, by any means; nor did he enter into the\r\ntone of Owen Fitzgerald\'s mind. They were both just men, but just in\r\nan essentially different manner. The justice of Mr. Prendergast had\r\ncome of thought and education. As a young man, when entering on his\r\nprofession, he was probably less just than he was now. He had thought\r\nabout matters of law and equity, till thought had shown to him the\r\nbeauty of equity as it should be practised,--often by the aid of law,\r\nand not unfrequently in spite of law. Such was the justice of Mr.\r\nPrendergast. That of Owen Fitzgerald had come of impulse and nature,\r\nand was the justice of a very young man rather than of a very wise\r\none. That title and property did not, as he felt, of justice belong\r\nto him, but to his cousin. What difference could it make in the true\r\njustice of things, whether or no that wretched man was still alive\r\nwhom all the world had regarded as dead? In justice he ought to be\r\ndead. Now that this calamity of the man\'s life had fallen upon Sir\r\nThomas and Lady Fitzgerald and his cousin Herbert, it would not\r\nbe for him to aggravate it by seizing upon a heritage which might\r\npossibly accrue to him under the letter of the world\'s law, but which\r\ncould not accrue to him under heaven\'s law. Such was the justice\r\nof Owen Fitzgerald; and we may say this of it in its dispraise,\r\nas comparing it with that other justice, that whereas that of Mr.\r\nPrendergast would wear for ever, through ages and ages, that other\r\njustice of Owen\'s would hardly have stood the pull of a ten years\'\r\nstruggle. When children came to him, would he not have thought of\r\nwhat might have been theirs by right; and then have thought of what\r\nought to be theirs by right; and so on?\r\n\r\nBut in speaking of justice, he had also spoken of revenge, and Mr.\r\nPrendergast was altogether in the dark. What revenge? He did not know\r\nthat poor Owen had lost a love, and that Herbert had found it. In the\r\nmidst of all the confused thoughts which this astounding intelligence\r\nhad brought upon him, Owen still thought of his love. There Herbert\r\nhad robbed him--robbed him by means of his wealth; and in that matter\r\nhe desired justice--justice or revenge. He wanted back his love.\r\nLet him have that and Herbert might yet be welcome to his title and\r\nestates.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast remained there for some half-hour longer, explaining\r\nwhat ought to be done, and how it ought to be done. Of course he\r\ncombated that idea of Owen\'s, that the property might be allowed to\r\nremain in the hands of the wrong heir. Had that been consonant with\r\nhis ideas of justice he would not have made his visit to Hap House\r\nthis morning. Right must have its way, and if it should be that Lady\r\nFitzgerald\'s marriage with Sir Thomas had not been legal, Owen, on\r\nSir Thomas\'s death, must become Sir Owen, and Herbert could not\r\nbecome Sir Herbert. So much to the mind of Mr. Prendergast was as\r\nclear as crystal. Let justice be done, even though these Castle\r\nRichmond heavens should fall in ruins.\r\n\r\nAnd then he took his departure, leaving Owen to his solitude, much\r\nperplexed. "And where is that man?" Mr. Prendergast asked, as he got\r\non to his car.\r\n\r\n"Bedad thin, yer honer, he\'s very bad intirely. He\'s jist sitthing\r\nover the kitchen fire, moaning and croning this way and that, but\r\nsorrow a word he\'s spoke since the masther hoisted him out o\' the big\r\nhall door. And thin for blood--why, saving yer honer\'s presence, he\'s\r\none mash of gore."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better wash his face for him, and give him a little tea," said\r\nMr. Prendergast, and then he drove away.\r\n\r\nAnd strange ideas floated across Owen Fitzgerald\'s brain as he sat\r\nthere alone, in his hunting gear, leaning on the still covered\r\nbreakfast-table. They floated across his brain backwards and\r\nforwards, and at last remained there, taking almost the form of a\r\ndefinite purpose. He would make a bargain with Herbert; let each of\r\nthem keep that which was fairly his own; let Herbert have all the\r\nbroad lands of Castle Richmond; let him have the title, the seat in\r\nparliament, and the county honour; but for him, Owen--let him have\r\nClara Desmond. He desired nothing that was not fairly his own; but\r\nas his own he did regard her, and without her he did not know how to\r\nface the future of his life. And in suggesting this arrangement to\r\nhimself, he did not altogether throw over her feelings; he did take\r\ninto account her heart, though he did not take into account her\r\nworldly prospects. She had loved him--him--Owen; and he would not\r\nteach himself to believe that she did not love him still. Her mother\r\nhad been too powerful for her, and she had weakly yielded; but as to\r\nher heart--Owen could not bring himself to believe that that was gone\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nThey two would make a bargain,--he and his cousin. Honour and renown,\r\nand the money and the title would be everything to his cousin.\r\nHerbert had been brought up to expect these things, and all the world\r\naround him had expected them for him. It would be terrible to him\r\nto find himself robbed of them. But the loss of Clara Desmond was\r\nequally terrible to Owen Fitzgerald. He allowed his heart to fill\r\nitself with a romantic sense of honour, teaching him that it behoved\r\nhim as a man not to give up his love. Without her he would live\r\ndisgraced in his own estimation; but who would not think the better\r\nof him for refraining from the possession of those Castle Richmond\r\nacres? Yes; he would make a bargain with Herbert. Who was there in\r\nthe world to deny his right to do so?\r\n\r\nAs he sat revolving these things in his mind, he suddenly heard a\r\nrushing sound, as of many horsemen down the avenue, and going to the\r\nwindow, he saw two or three leading men of the hunt, accompanied by\r\nthe gray-haired old huntsman; and through and about and under the\r\nhorsemen were the dogs, running in and out of the laurels which\r\nskirted the road, with their noses down, giving every now and then\r\nshort yelps as they caught up the uncertain scent from the leaves on\r\nthe ground, and hurried on upon the trail of their game.\r\n\r\n"Yo ho! to him, Messenger; hark to him, Maybird; good bitch,\r\nMerrylass. He\'s down here, gen\'lemen, and he\'ll never get away\r\nalive. He came to a bad place when he looked out for going to ground\r\nanywhere near Mr. Owen."\r\n\r\nAnd then there came, fast trotting down through the other horsemen,\r\nmaking his way eagerly to the front, a stout heavy man, with a florid\r\nhandsome face and eager eye. He might be some fifty years of age, but\r\nno lad there of three-and-twenty was so anxious and impetuous as he.\r\nHe was riding a large-boned, fast-trotting bay horse, that pressed on\r\nas eagerly as his rider. As he hurried forward all made way for him,\r\ntill he was close to the shrubs in the front of the house.\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul, gentlemen," he said, in an angry voice, "how, in the\r\nname of all that\'s good, are hounds to hunt if you press them down\r\nthe road in that way? By heavens, Barry, you are enough to drive\r\na man wild. Yoicks, Merrylass! there it is, Pat;"--Pat was the\r\nhuntsman--"outside the low wall there, down towards the river." This\r\nwas Sam O\'Grady, the master of the Duhallow hounds, the god of Owen\'s\r\nidolatry. No better fellow ever lived, and no master of hounds, so\r\ngood; such at least was the opinion common among Duhallow sportsmen.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yer honer,--he did skirt round there, I knows that; but he\'s\r\nbeen among them laurels at the bottom, and he\'ll be about the place\r\nand outhouses somewhere. There\'s a drain here that I knows on, and he\r\nknows on. But Mr. Owen, he knows on it too; and there aint a chance\r\nfor him." So argued Pat, the Duhallow huntsman, the experienced craft\r\nof whose aged mind enabled him to run counter to the cutest dodges\r\nof the cutest fox in that and any of the three neighbouring baronies.\r\n\r\nAnd now the sweep before the door was crowded with red coats; and\r\nOwen, looking from his dining-room window, felt that he must take\r\nsome step. As an ordinary rule, had the hunt thus drifted near his\r\nhomestead, he would have been off his horse and down among his\r\nbottles, sending up sherry and cherry-brandy; and there would have\r\nbeen comfortable drink in plenty, and cold meat, perhaps, not in\r\nplenty; and every one would have been welcome in and out of the\r\nhouse. But now there was that at his heart which forbade him to mix\r\nwith the men who knew him so well, and among whom he was customarily\r\nso loudly joyous. Dressed as he was, he could not go among them\r\nwithout explaining why he had remained at home; and as to that, he\r\nfelt that he was not able to give any explanation at the present\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter with Owen?" said one fellow to Captain Donnellan.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I hardly know. Two chaps came to him this morning,\r\nbefore he was up; about business, they said. He nearly murdered one\r\nof them out of hand; and I believe that he\'s locked up somewhere with\r\nthe other this minute."\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime a servant came up to Mr. O\'Grady, and, touching\r\nhis hat, asked the master of the hunt to go into the house for a\r\nmoment; and then Mr. O\'Grady, dismounting, entered in through the\r\nfront door. He was only there two minutes, for his mind was still\r\noutside, among the laurels, with the fox; but as he put his foot\r\nagain into the stirrup, he said to those around him that they\r\nmust hurry away, and not disturb Owen Fitzgerald that day. It may,\r\ntherefore, easily be imagined that the mystery would spread quickly\r\nthrough that portion of the county of Cork.\r\n\r\nThey must hurry away;--but not before they could give an account of\r\ntheir fox. Neither for gods nor men must he be left, as long as his\r\nskin was whole above ground. There is an importance attaching to the\r\npursuit of a fox, which gives it a character quite distinct from that\r\nof any other amusement which men follow in these realms. It justifies\r\nalmost anything that men can do, and that at any place and in any\r\nseason. There is about it a sanctity which forbids interruption,\r\nand makes its votaries safe under any circumstances of trespass or\r\nintrusion. A man in a hunting county who opposes the county hunt must\r\nbe a misanthrope, willing to live in seclusion, fond of being in\r\nCoventry, and in love with the enmity of his fellow-creatures. There\r\nare such men, but they are regarded as lepers by those around them.\r\nAll this adds to the nobleness of the noble sport, and makes it\r\nworthy of a man\'s energies.\r\n\r\nAnd then the crowd of huntsmen hurried round from the front of\r\nthe house to a paddock at the back, and then again through the\r\nstable yard to the front. The hounds were about--here, there, and\r\neverywhere, as any one ignorant of the craft would have said, but\r\nstill always on the scent of that doomed beast. From one thicket\r\nto another he tried to hide himself, but the moist leaves of the\r\nunderwood told quickly of his whereabouts. He tried every hole and\r\ncranny about the house, but every hole and corner had been stopped by\r\nOwen\'s jealous care. He would have lived disgraced for ever in his\r\nown estimation, had a fox gone to ground anywhere about his domicile.\r\nAt last a loud whoop was heard just in front of the hall door. The\r\npoor fox, with his last gasp of strength, had betaken himself to the\r\nthicket before the door, and there the dogs had killed him, at the\r\nvery spot on which Aby Mollett had fallen.\r\n\r\nStanding well back from the window, still thinking of Clara Desmond,\r\nOwen Fitzgerald saw the fate of the hunted animal; he saw the head\r\nand tail severed from the carcase by old Pat, and the body thrown to\r\nthe hounds,--a ceremony over which he had presided so many scores of\r\ntimes; and then, when the dogs had ceased to growl over the bloody\r\nfragments, he saw the hunt move away, back along the avenue to the\r\nhigh road. All this he saw, but still he was thinking of Clara\r\nDesmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nA MUDDY WALK ON A WET MORNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that day of the hunt was passed very quietly at Castle Richmond.\r\nHerbert did not once leave the house, having begged Mr. Somers to\r\nmake his excuse at a Relief Committee which it would have been his\r\nbusiness to attend. A great portion of the day he spent with his\r\nfather, who lay all but motionless, in a state that was apparently\r\nhalf comatose. During all those long hours very little was said\r\nbetween them about this tragedy of their family. Why should more be\r\nsaid now; now that the worst had befallen them--all that worst, to\r\nhide which Sir Thomas had endured such superhuman agony? And then\r\nfour or five times during the day he went to his mother, but with her\r\nhe did not stay long. To her he could hardly speak upon any subject,\r\nfor to her as yet the story had not been told.\r\n\r\nAnd she, when he thus came to her from time to time, with a soft word\r\nor two, or a softer kiss, would ask him no question. She knew that\r\nhe had learned the whole, and knew also from the solemn cloud on his\r\nbrow that that whole must be very dreadful. Indeed we may surmise\r\nthat her woman\'s heart had by this time guessed somewhat of the\r\ntruth. But she would inquire of no one. Jones, she was sure, knew\r\nit all; but she did not ask a single question of her servant. It\r\nwould be told to her when it was fitting. Why should she move in the\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\nWhenever Herbert entered her room she tried to receive him with\r\nsomething of a smile. It was clear enough that she was always glad of\r\nhis coming, and that she made some little show of welcoming him. A\r\nbook was always put away, very softly and by the slightest motion;\r\nbut Herbert well knew what that book was, and whence his mother\r\nsought that strength which enabled her to live through such an ordeal\r\nas this.\r\n\r\nAnd his sisters were to be seen, moving slowly about the house like\r\nthe very ghosts of their former selves. Their voices were hardly\r\nheard; no ring of customary laughter ever came from the room in which\r\nthey sat; when they passed their brother in the house they hardly\r\ndared to whisper to him. As to sitting down at table now with Mr.\r\nPrendergast, that effort was wholly abandoned; they kept themselves\r\neven from the sound of his footsteps.\r\n\r\nAunt Letty perhaps spoke more than the others, but what could she\r\nspeak to the purpose? "Herbert," she once said, as she caught him\r\nclose by the door of the library and almost pulled him into the\r\nroom--"Herbert, I charge you to tell me what all this is!"\r\n\r\n"I can tell you nothing, dear aunt, nothing;--nothing as yet."\r\n\r\n"But, Herbert, tell me this; is it about my sister?" For very many\r\nyears past Aunt Letty had always called Lady Fitzgerald her sister.\r\n\r\n"I can tell you nothing;--nothing to-day."\r\n\r\n"Then, to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I do not know--we must let Mr. Prendergast manage this matter as he\r\nwill. I have taken nothing on myself, Aunt Letty--nothing."\r\n\r\n"Then I tell you what, Herbert; it will kill me. It will kill us all,\r\nas it is killing your father and your darling mother. I tell you that\r\nit is killing her fast. Human nature cannot bear it. For myself I\r\ncould endure anything if I were trusted." And sitting down in one of\r\nthe high-backed library chairs she burst into a flood of tears; a\r\nsight which, as regarded Aunt Letty, Herbert had never seen before.\r\n\r\nWhat if they all died? thought Herbert to himself in the bitterness\r\nof the moment. There was that in store for some of them which was\r\nworse than death. What business had Aunt Letty to talk of her misery?\r\nOf course she was wretched, as they all were; but how could she\r\nappreciate the burden that was on his back? What was Clara Desmond to\r\nher?\r\n\r\nShortly after noon Mr. Prendergast was back at the house; but he\r\nslunk up to his room, and no one saw anything of him. At half-past\r\nsix he came down, and Herbert constrained himself to sit at the table\r\nwhile dinner was served; and so the day passed away. One more day\r\nonly Mr. Prendergast was to stay at Castle Richmond; and then, if,\r\nas he expected, certain letters should reach him on that morning, he\r\nwas to start for London late on the following day. It may well be\r\nimagined that he was not desirous of prolonging his visit.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning Herbert started for a long solitary\r\nwalk. On that day Mr. Prendergast was to tell everything to his\r\nmother, and it was determined between them that her son should not be\r\nin the house during the telling. In the evening, when he came home,\r\nhe was to see her. So he started on his walk, resolving some other\r\nthings also in his mind before he went. He would reach Desmond Court\r\nbefore he returned home that day, and let the two ladies there know\r\nthe fate that was before them. Then, after that, they might let him\r\nknow what was to be his fate;--but on this head he would not hurry\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo he started on his walk, resolving to go round by Gortnaclough on\r\nhis way to Desmond Court, and then to return home from that place.\r\nThe road would be more than twenty long Irish miles; but he felt\r\nthat the hard work would be of service. It was instinct rather than\r\nthought which taught him that it would be good for him to put some\r\nstrain on the muscles of his body, and thus relieve the muscles of\r\nhis mind. If his limbs could become thoroughly tired,--thoroughly\r\ntired so that he might wish to rest--then he might hope that for a\r\nmoment he might cease to think of all this sorrow which encompassed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSo he started on his walk, taking with him a thick cudgel and his own\r\nthoughts. He went away across the demesne and down into the road that\r\nled away by Gortnaclough and Boherbue towards Castleisland and the\r\nwilds of county Kerry. As he went, the men about the place refrained\r\nfrom speaking to him, for they all knew that bad news had come to the\r\nbig house. They looked at him with lowered eyes and with tenderness\r\nin their hearts, for they loved the very name of Fitzgerald. The love\r\nwhich a poor Irishman feels for the gentleman whom he regards as his\r\nmaster--"his masther," though he has probably never received from\r\nhim, in money, wages for a day\'s work, and in all his intercourse\r\nhas been the man who has paid money and not the man who received\r\nit--the love which he nevertheless feels, if he has been occasionally\r\nlooked on with a smiling face and accosted with a kindly word, is\r\nastonishing to an Englishman. I will not say that the feeling is\r\naltogether good. Love should come of love. Where personal love exists\r\non one side, and not even personal regard on the other, there must be\r\nsome mixture of servility. That unbounded respect for human grandeur\r\ncannot be altogether good; for human greatness, if the greatness be\r\nproperly sifted, it may be so.\r\n\r\nHe got down into the road, and went forth upon his journey at a rapid\r\npace. The mud was deep upon the way, but he went through the thickest\r\nwithout a thought of it. He had not been out long before there came\r\non a cold, light, drizzling rain, such a rain as gradually but\r\nsurely makes its way into the innermost rag of a man\'s clothing,\r\nrunning up the inside of his waterproof coat, and penetrating by its\r\nperseverance the very folds of his necktie. Such cold, drizzling rain\r\nis the commonest phase of hard weather during Irish winters, and\r\nthose who are out and about get used to it and treat it tenderly.\r\nThey are euphemistical as to the weather, calling it hazy and soft,\r\nand never allowing themselves to carry bad language on such a subject\r\nbeyond the word dull. And yet at such a time one breathes the rain\r\nand again exhales it, and become as it were oneself a water spirit,\r\nassuming an aqueous fishlike nature into one\'s inner fibres. It must\r\nbe acknowledged that a man does sometimes get wet in Ireland; but\r\nthen a wetting there brings no cold in the head, no husky voice, no\r\nneed for multitudinous pocket-handkerchiefs, as it does here in this\r\nland of catarrhs. It is the east wind and not the rain that kills;\r\nand of east wind in the south of Ireland they know nothing.\r\n\r\nBut Herbert walked on quite unmindful of the mist, swinging his thick\r\nstick in his hand, and ever increasing his pace as he went. He was\r\nusually a man careful of such things, but it was nothing to him now\r\nwhether he were wet or dry. His mind was so full of the immediate\r\ncircumstances of his destiny that he could not think of small\r\nexternal accidents. What was to be his future life in this world, and\r\nhow was he to fight the battle that was now before him? That was the\r\nquestion which he continually asked himself, and yet never succeeded\r\nin answering. How was he to come down from the throne on which early\r\ncircumstances had placed him, and hustle and struggle among the crowd\r\nfor such approach to other thrones as his sinews and shoulders might\r\nprocure for him? If he had been only born to the struggle, he said to\r\nhimself, how easy and pleasant it would have been to him! But to find\r\nhimself thus cast out from his place by an accident--cast out with\r\nthe eyes of all the world upon him; to be talked of, and pointed at,\r\nand pitied; to have little aids offered him by men whom he regarded\r\nas beneath him--all this was terribly sore, and the burden was almost\r\ntoo much for his strength. "I do not care for the money," he said to\r\nhimself a dozen times; and in saying so he spoke in one sense truly.\r\nBut he did care for things which money buys; for outward respect,\r\npermission to speak with authority among his fellow-men, for power\r\nand place, and the feeling that he was prominent in his walk of life.\r\nTo be in advance of other men, that is the desire which is strongest\r\nin the hearts of all strong men; and in that desire how terrible a\r\nfall had he not received from this catastrophe!\r\n\r\nAnd what were they all to do, he and his mother and his sisters?\r\nHow were they to act--now, at once? In what way were they to carry\r\nthemselves when this man of law and judgment should have gone from\r\nthem? For himself, his course of action must depend much upon the\r\nword which might be spoken to him to-day at Desmond Court. There\r\nwould still be a drop of comfort left at the bottom of his cup if he\r\nmight be allowed to hope there. But in truth he feared greatly. What\r\nthe countess would say to him he thought he could foretell; what it\r\nwould behove him to say himself--in matter, though not in words--that\r\nhe knew well. Would not the two sayings tally well together? and\r\ncould it be right for him even to hope that the love of a girl of\r\nseventeen should stand firm against her mother\'s will, when her lover\r\nhimself could not dare to press his suit? And then another reflection\r\npressed on his mind sorely. Clara had already given up one poor lover\r\nat her mother\'s instance; might she not resume that lover, also at\r\nher mother\'s instance, now that he was no longer poor? What if Owen\r\nFitzgerald should take from him everything!\r\n\r\nAnd so he walked on through the mud and rain, always swinging his big\r\nstick. Perhaps, after all, the worst of it was over with him, when he\r\ncould argue with himself in this way. It is the first plunge into the\r\ncold water that gives the shock. We may almost say that every human\r\nmisery will cease to be miserable if it be duly faced; and something\r\nis done towards conquering our miseries, when we face them in any\r\ndegree, even if not with due courage. Herbert had taken his plunge\r\ninto the deep, dark, cold, comfortless pool of misfortune; and he\r\nfelt that the waters around him were very cold. But the plunge had\r\nbeen taken, and the worst, perhaps, was gone by.\r\n\r\nAs he approached near to Gortnaclough, he came upon one of those\r\ngangs of road-destroyers who were now at work everywhere, earning\r\ntheir pittance of "yellow meal" with a pickaxe and a wheelbarrow. In\r\nsome sort or other the labourers had been got to their work. Gangsmen\r\nthere were with lists, who did see, more or less accurately, that\r\nthe men, before they received their sixpence or eightpence for their\r\nday\'s work, did at any rate pass their day with some sort of tool\r\nin their hands. And consequently the surface of the hill began to\r\ndisappear, and there were chasms in the road, which caused those who\r\ntravelled on wheels to sit still, staring across with angry eyes, and\r\nsometimes to apostrophize the doer of these deeds with very naughty\r\nwords. The doer was the Board of Works, or the "Board" as it was\r\nfamiliarly termed; and were it not that those ill words must have\r\nreturned to the bosoms which vented them, and have flown no further,\r\nno Board could ever have been so terribly curse-laden. To find\r\noneself at last utterly stopped, after proceeding with great strain\r\nto one\'s horse for half a mile through an artificial quagmire of\r\nslush up to the wheelbox, is harassing to the customary traveller;\r\nand men at that crisis did not bethink themselves quite so frequently\r\nas they should have done, that a people perishing from famine is more\r\nharassing.\r\n\r\nBut Herbert was not on wheels, and was proceeding through the slush\r\nand across the chasm, regardless of it all, when he was stopped\r\nby some of the men. All the land thereabouts was Castle Richmond\r\nproperty; and it was not probable that the young master of it all\r\nwould be allowed to pass through some two score of his own tenantry\r\nwithout greetings, and petitions, and blessings, and complaints.\r\n\r\n"Faix, yer honer, thin, Mr. Herbert," said one man, standing at the\r\nbottom of the hill, with the half-filled wheelbarrow still hanging\r\nin his hands--an Englishman would have put down the barrow while\r\nhe was speaking, making some inner calculation about the waste of\r\nhis muscles; but an Irishman would despise himself for such low\r\neconomy--"Faix, thin, yer honer, Mr. Herbert; an\' it\'s yourself is a\r\nsight good for sore eyes. May the heavens be your bed, for it\'s you\r\nis the frind to a poor man."\r\n\r\n"How are you, Pat?" said Herbert, without intending to stop. "How are\r\nyou, Mooney? I hope the work suits you all." And then he would at\r\nonce have passed on, with his hat pressed down low over his brow.\r\n\r\nBut this could be by no means allowed. In the first place, the\r\nexcitement arising from the young master\'s presence was too valuable\r\nto be lost so suddenly; and then, when might again occur so excellent\r\na time for some mention of their heavy grievances? Men whose whole\r\namount of worldly good consists in a bare allowance of nauseous food,\r\njust sufficient to keep body and soul together, must be excused if\r\nthey wish to utter their complaints to ears that can hear them.\r\n\r\n"Arrah, yer honer, thin, we\'re none on us very well; and how could\r\nwe, with the male at a penny a pound?" said Pat.\r\n\r\n"Sorrow to it for male," said Mooney. "It\'s the worst vittles iver a\r\nman tooked into the inside of him. Saving yer honer\'s presence it\'s\r\nas much as I can do to raise the bare arm of me since the day I first\r\nbegan with the yally male."\r\n\r\n"It\'s as wake as cats we all is," said another, who from the weary\r\nway in which he dragged his limbs about certainly did not himself\r\nseem to be gifted with much animal strength.\r\n\r\n"And the childer is worse, yer honer," said a fourth. "The male is\r\nbad for them intirely. Saving yer honer\'s presence, their bellies is\r\ngone away most to nothing."\r\n\r\n"And there\'s six of us in family, yer honer," said Pat. "Six mouths\r\nto feed; and what\'s eight pennorth of yally male among such a lot as\r\nthat; let alone the Sundays, when there\'s nothing?"\r\n\r\n"An\' shure, Mr. Herbert," said another, a small man with a squeaking\r\nvoice, whose rags of clothes hardly hung on to his body, "warn\'t I\r\nhere with the other boys the last Friday as iver was? Ax Pat Condon\r\nelse, yer honer; and yet when they comed to give out the wages, they\r\nsconced me of--." And so on. There were as many complaints to be made\r\nas there were men, if only he could bring himself to listen to them.\r\n\r\nOn ordinary occasions Herbert would listen to them, and answer them,\r\nand give them, at any rate, the satisfaction which they derived from\r\ndiscoursing with him, if he could give them no other satisfaction.\r\nBut now, on this day, with his own burden so heavy at his heart, he\r\ncould not even do this. He could not think of their sorrows; his\r\nown sorrow seemed to him to be so much the heavier. So he passed on,\r\nrunning the gauntlet through them as best he might, and shaking them\r\noff from him, as they attempted to cling round his steps. Nothing is\r\nso powerful in making a man selfish as misfortune.\r\n\r\nAnd then he went on to Gortnaclough. He had not chosen his walk\r\nto this place with any fixed object, except this perhaps, that it\r\nenabled him to return home round by Desmond Court. It was one of the\r\nplaces at which a Relief Committee sat every fortnight, and there was\r\na soup-kitchen here, which, however, had not been so successful as\r\nthe one at Berryhill; and it was the place of residence selected by\r\nFather Barney\'s coadjutor. But in spite of all this, when Herbert\r\nfound himself in the wretched, dirty, straggling, damp street of the\r\nvillage, he did not know what to do or where to betake himself. That\r\nevery eye in Gortnaclough would be upon him was a matter of course.\r\nHe could hardly turn round on his heel and retrace his steps through\r\nthe village, as he would have to do in going to Desmond Court,\r\nwithout showing some pretext for his coming there; so he walked into\r\nthe little shop which was attached to the soup-kitchen, and there he\r\nfound the Rev. Mr. Columb Creagh, giving his orders to the little\r\ngirl behind the counter.\r\n\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald was customarily very civil to the Roman Catholic\r\npriests around him,--somewhat more so, indeed, than seemed good to\r\nthose very excellent ladies, Mrs. Townsend and Aunt Letty; but it\r\nalways went against the grain with him to be civil to the Rev. Columb\r\nCreagh; and on this special day it would have gone against the\r\ngrain with him to be civil to anybody. But the coadjutor knew his\r\ncharacter, and was delighted to have an opportunity of talking to\r\nhim, when he could do so without being snubbed either by Mr. Somers,\r\nthe chairman, or by his own parish priest. Mr. Creagh had rejoiced\r\nmuch at the idea of forming one at the same council board with county\r\nmagistrates and Protestant parsons; but the fruition of his promised\r\ndelights had never quite reached his lips. He had been like Sancho\r\nPanza in his government; he had sat down to the grand table day after\r\nday, but had never yet been allowed to enjoy the rich dish of his\r\nown oratory. Whenever he had proposed to help himself, Mr. Somers or\r\nFather Barney had stopped his mouth. Now probably he might be able to\r\nsay a word or two; and though the glory would not be equal to that of\r\nmaking a speech at the Committee, still it would be something to be\r\nseen talking on equal terms, and on affairs of state, to the young\r\nheir of Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald! well, I declare! And how are you, sir?" And he took\r\noff his hat and bowed, and got hold of Herbert\'s hand, shaking it\r\nruthlessly; and altogether he made him very disagreeable.\r\n\r\nHerbert, though his mind was not really intent on the subject, asked\r\nsome question of the girl as to the amount of meal that had been\r\nsold, and desired to see the little passbook that they kept at the\r\nshop.\r\n\r\n"We are doing pretty well, Mr. Fitzgerald," said the coadjutor;\r\n"pretty well. I always keep my eye on, for fear things should go\r\nwrong, you know."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think they\'ll do that," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"No; I hope not. But it\'s always good to be on the safe side, you\r\nknow. And to tell you the truth, I don\'t think we\'re altogether on\r\nthe right tack about them shops. It\'s very hard on a poor woman--"\r\n\r\nNow the fact was, though the Relief Committee at Gortnaclough was\r\nattended by magistrates, priests, and parsons, the shop there was\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald\'s own affair. It had been stocked with his or his\r\nfather\'s money; the flour was sold without profit at his risk, and\r\nthe rent of the house and wages of the woman who kept it came out of\r\nhis own pocket-money. Under these circumstances he did not see cause\r\nwhy Mr. Creagh should interfere, and at the present moment was not\r\nwell inclined to put up with such interference.\r\n\r\n"We do the best we can, Mr. Creagh," said he, interrupting the\r\npriest. "And no good will be done at such a time as this by\r\nunnecessary difficulties."\r\n\r\n"No, no, certainly not. But still I do think--" And Mr. Creagh was\r\ngirding up his loins for eloquence, when he was again interrupted.\r\n\r\n"I am rather in a hurry to-day," said Herbert, "and therefore, if you\r\nplease, we won\'t make any change now. Never mind the book to-day,\r\nSally. Good day, Mr. Creagh." And so saying, he left the shop and\r\nwalked rapidly back out of the village.\r\n\r\nThe poor coadjutor was left alone at the shop-door, anathematizing in\r\nhis heart the pride of all Protestants. He had been told that this\r\nMr. Fitzgerald was different from others, that he was a man fond of\r\npriests and addicted to the "ould religion;" and so hearing, he had\r\nresolved to make the most of such an excellent disposition. But he\r\nwas forced to confess to himself that they were all alike. Mr. Somers\r\ncould not have been more imperious, nor Mr. Townsend more insolent.\r\n\r\nAnd then, through the still drizzling rain, Herbert walked on to\r\nDesmond Court. By the time that he reached the desolate-looking lodge\r\nat the demesne gate, he was nearly wet through, and was besmeared\r\nwith mud up to his knees. But he had thought nothing of this as he\r\nwalked along. His mind had been intent on the scene that was before\r\nhim. In what words was he to break the news to Clara Desmond and\r\nher mother? and with what words would they receive the tidings? The\r\nformer question he had by no means answered to his own satisfaction,\r\nwhen, all muddy and wet, he passed up to the house through that\r\ndesolate gate.\r\n\r\n"Is Lady Desmond at home?" he asked of the butler. "Her ladyship is\r\nat home," said the gray-haired old man, with his blandest smile, "and\r\nso is Lady Clara." He had already learned to look on the heir of\r\nCastle Richmond as the coming saviour of the impoverished Desmond\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nCOMFORTLESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Herbert, yer honor, you\'re wet through and\r\nthrough--surely," said the butler, as soon as Fitzgerald was well\r\ninside the hall. Herbert muttered something about his being only\r\ndamp, and that it did not signify. But it did signify,--very\r\nmuch,--in the butler\'s estimation. Whose being wet through could\r\nsignify more; for was not Mr. Herbert to be a baronet, and to have\r\nthe spending of twelve thousand a year; and would he not be the\r\nfuture husband of Lady Clara? not signify indeed!\r\n\r\n"An\' shure, Mr. Herbert, you haven\'t walked to Desmond Court this\r\nblessed morning. Tare an\' ages! Well; there\'s no knowing what you\r\nyoung gentlemen won\'t do. But I\'ll see and get a pair of trousers of\r\nmy Lord\'s ready for you in two minutes. Faix, and he\'s nearly as big\r\nas yourself, now, Mr. Herbert."\r\n\r\nBut Herbert would hardly speak to him, and gave no assent whatever as\r\nto his proposition for borrowing the Earl\'s clothes. "I\'ll go in as\r\nI am," said he. And the old man looking into his face saw that there\r\nwas something wrong. "Shure an\' he ain\'t going to sthrike off now,"\r\nsaid this Irish Caleb Balderstone to himself. He also as well as some\r\nothers about Desmond Court had feared greatly that Lady Clara would\r\nthrow herself away upon a poor lover.\r\n\r\nIt was now past noon, and Fitzgerald pressed forward into the room\r\nin which Lady Clara usually sat. It was the same in which she had\r\nreceived Owen\'s visit, and here of a morning she was usually to be\r\nfound alone; but on this occasion when he opened the door he found\r\nthat her mother was with her. Since the day on which Clara had\r\ndisposed of herself so excellently, the mother had spent more of\r\nher time with her daughter. Looking at Clara now through Herbert\r\nFitzgerald\'s eyes, the Countess had began to confess to herself that\r\nher child did possess beauty and charm.\r\n\r\nShe got up to greet her future son-in-law with a sweet smile and that\r\ncharming quiet welcome with which a woman so well knows how to make\r\nher house pleasant to a man that is welcome to it. And Clara, not\r\nrising, but turning her head round and looking at him, greeted him\r\nalso. He came forward and took both their hands, and it was not till\r\nhe had held Clara\'s for half a minute in his own that they both saw\r\nthat he was more than ordinarily serious. "I hope Sir Thomas is not\r\nworse," said Lady Desmond, with that voice of feigned interest which\r\nis so common. After all, if anything should happen to the poor old\r\nweak gentleman, might it not be as well?\r\n\r\n"My father has not been very well these last two days," he said.\r\n\r\n"I am so sorry," said Clara. "And your mother, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n"But Herbert, how wet you are. You must have walked," said the\r\nCountess.\r\n\r\nHerbert, in a few dull words said that he had walked. He had thought\r\nthat the walk would be good for him, and he had not expected that it\r\nwould be so wet. And then Lady Desmond, looking carefully into his\r\nface, saw that in truth he was very serious;--so much so that she\r\nknew that he had come there on account of his seriousness. But still\r\nhis sorrow did not in any degree go to her heart. He was grieving\r\ndoubtless for his father,--or his mother. The house at Castle\r\nRichmond was probably sad, because sickness and fear of death were\r\nthere;--nay perhaps death itself now hanging over some loved head.\r\nBut what was this to her? She had had her own sorrows;--enough of\r\nthem perhaps to account for her being selfish. So with a solemn face,\r\nbut with nothing amiss about her heart, she again asked for tidings\r\nfrom Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"Do tell us," said Clara, getting up. "I am afraid Sir Thomas is very\r\nill." The old baronet had been kind to her, and she did regard him.\r\nTo her it was a sorrow to think that there should be any sorrow at\r\nCastle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"Yes; he is ill," said Herbert. "We have had a gentleman from London\r\nwith us for the last few days--a friend of my father\'s. His name is\r\nMr. Prendergast."\r\n\r\n"Is he a doctor?" asked the Countess.\r\n\r\n"No, not a doctor," said Herbert. "He is a lawyer."\r\n\r\nIt was very hard for him to begin his story; and perhaps the more so\r\nin that he was wet through and covered with mud. He now felt cold and\r\nclammy, and began to have an idea that he should not be seated there\r\nin that room in such a guise. Clara, too, had instinctively learned\r\nfrom his face, and tone, and general bearing that something truly was\r\nthe matter. At other times when he had been there, since that day on\r\nwhich he had been accepted, he had been completely master of himself.\r\nPerhaps it had almost been deemed a fault in him that he had had none\r\nof the timidity or hesitation of a lover. He had seemed to feel, no\r\ndoubt, that he, with his fortune and position at his back, need feel\r\nno scruple in accepting as his own the fair hand for which he had\r\nasked. But now--nothing could be more different from this than his\r\nmanner was now.\r\n\r\nLady Desmond was now surprised, though probably not as yet\r\nfrightened. Why should a lawyer have come from London to visit Sir\r\nThomas at a period of such illness? and why should Herbert have\r\nwalked over to Desmond Court to tell them of this illness? There must\r\nbe something in this lawyer\'s coming which was intended to bear in\r\nsome way on her daughter\'s marriage. "But, Herbert," she said, "you\r\nare quite wet. Will you not put on some of Patrick\'s things?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said he; "I shall not stay long. I shall soon have\r\nsaid what I have got to say."\r\n\r\n"But do, Herbert," said Clara. "I cannot bear to see you so\r\nuncomfortable. And then you will not be in such a hurry to go back."\r\n\r\n"Ill as my father is," said he, "I cannot stay long; but I have\r\nthought it my duty to come over and tell you--tell you what has\r\nhappened at Castle Richmond."\r\n\r\nAnd now the countess was frightened. There was that in Herbert\'s tone\r\nof voice and the form of his countenance which was enough to frighten\r\nany woman. What had happened at Castle Richmond? what could have\r\nhappened there to make necessary the presence of a lawyer, and at the\r\nsame time thus to sadden her future son-in-law? And Clara also was\r\nfrightened, though she knew not why. His manner was so different from\r\nthat which was usual; he was so cold, and serious, and awe-struck,\r\nthat she could not but be unhappy.\r\n\r\n"And what is it?" said the Countess.\r\n\r\nHerbert then sat for a few minutes silent, thinking how best he\r\nshould tell them his story. He had been all the morning resolving to\r\ntell it, but he had in nowise as yet fixed upon any method. It was\r\nall so terribly tragic, so frightful in the extent of its reality,\r\nthat he hardly knew how it would be possible for him to get through\r\nhis task.\r\n\r\n"I hope that no misfortune has come upon any of the family," said\r\nLady Desmond, now beginning to think that there might be misfortunes\r\nwhich would affect her own daughter more nearly than the illness\r\neither of the baronet or of his wife.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope not!" said Clara, getting up and clasping her hands.\r\n"What is it, Herbert? why don\'t you speak?" And coming round to him,\r\nshe took hold of his arm.\r\n\r\n"Dearest Clara," he said, looking at her with more tenderness than\r\nhad ever been usual with him, "I think that you had better leave us.\r\nI could tell it better to your mother alone."\r\n\r\n"Do, Clara, love. Go, dearest, and we will call you by-and-by."\r\n\r\nClara moved away very slowly towards the door, and then she turned\r\nround. "If it is anything that makes you unhappy, Herbert," she said,\r\n"I must know it before you leave me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes; either I or your mother--. You shall be told, certainly."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, you shall be told," said the countess. "And now go, my\r\ndarling." Thus dismissed, Clara did go, and betook herself to her own\r\nchamber. Had Owen had sorrows to tell her, he would have told them to\r\nherself; of that she was quite sure. "And now, Herbert, for heaven\'s\r\nsake what is it?" said the countess, pale with terror. She was fully\r\ncertain now that something was to be spoken which would be calculated\r\nto interfere with her daughter\'s prospects.\r\n\r\nWe all know the story which Herbert had to tell, and we need not\r\ntherefore again be present at the telling of it. Sitting there, wet\r\nthrough, in Lady Desmond\'s drawing-room, he did contrive to utter it\r\nall--the whole of it from the beginning to the end, making it clearly\r\nto be understood that he was no longer Fitzgerald of Castle Richmond,\r\nbut a nameless, pennyless outcast, without the hope of portion or\r\nposition, doomed from henceforth to earn his bread in the sweat of\r\nhis brow--if only he could be fortunate enough to find the means of\r\nearning it.\r\n\r\nNor did Lady Desmond once interrupt him in his story. She sat\r\nperfectly still, listening to him almost with unmoved face. She was\r\ntoo wise to let him know what the instant working of her mind might\r\nbe before she had made her own fixed resolve; and she had conceived\r\nthe truth much before he had completed the telling of it. We\r\ngenerally use three times the number of words which are necessary\r\nfor the purpose which we have in hand; but had he used six times the\r\nnumber, she would not have interrupted him. It was good in him to\r\ngive her this time to determine in what tone and with what words\r\nshe would speak, when speaking on her part should become absolutely\r\nnecessary. "And now," he concluded by saying--and at this time he\r\nwas standing up on the rug--"you know it all, Lady Desmond. It will\r\nperhaps be best that Clara should learn it from you."\r\n\r\nHe had said not a word of giving up his pretensions to Lady Clara\'s\r\nhand; but then neither had he in any way hinted that the match\r\nshould, in his opinion, be regarded as unbroken. He had not spoken of\r\nhis sorrow at bringing down all this poverty on his wife; and surely\r\nhe would have so spoken had he thought their engagement was still\r\nvalid; but then he had not himself pointed out that the engagement\r\nmust necessarily be broken, as, in Lady Desmond\'s opinion, he\r\ncertainly should have done.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said she, in a cold, low, meaningless voice--in a voice that\r\ntold nothing by its tones--"Lady Clara had better hear it from me."\r\nBut in the title which she gave her daughter, Herbert instantly read\r\nhis doom. He, however, remained silent. It was for the countess now\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n"But it is possible it may not be true," she said, speaking almost in\r\na whisper, looking, not into his face, but by him, at the fire.\r\n\r\n"It is possible; but so barely possible, that I did not think it\r\nright to keep the matter from you any longer."\r\n\r\n"It would have been very wrong--very wicked, I may say," said the\r\ncountess.\r\n\r\n"It is only two days since I knew anything of it myself," said he,\r\nvindicating himself.\r\n\r\n"You were of course bound to let me know immediately," she said,\r\nharshly.\r\n\r\n"And I have let you know immediately, Lady Desmond." And then they\r\nwere both again silent for a while.\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Prendergast thinks there is no doubt?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"None," said Herbert, very decidedly.\r\n\r\n"And he has told your cousin Owen?"\r\n\r\n"He did so yesterday; and by this time my poor mother knows it also."\r\nAnd then there was another period of silence.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time Lady Desmond had uttered no one word of\r\ncondolence--not a syllable of commiseration for all the sufferings\r\nthat had come upon Herbert and his family; and he was beginning to\r\nhate her for her harshness. The tenor of her countenance had become\r\nhard; and she received all his words as a judge might have taken\r\nthem, merely wanting evidence before he pronounced his verdict. The\r\nevidence she was beginning to think sufficient, and there could be no\r\ndoubt as to her verdict. After what she had heard, a match between\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald and her daughter would be out of the question.\r\n"It is very dreadful," she said, thinking only of her own child, and\r\nabsolutely shivering at the danger which had been incurred.\r\n\r\n"It is very dreadful," said Herbert, shivering also. It was almost\r\nincredible to him that his great sorrow should be received in such a\r\nway by one who had professed to be so dear a friend to him.\r\n\r\n"And what do you propose to do, Mr. Fitzgerald?" said the countess.\r\n\r\n"What do I propose?" he said, repeating her words. "Hitherto I have\r\nhad neither time nor heart to propose anything. Such a misfortune\r\nas that which I have told you does not break upon a man without\r\ndisturbing for a while his power of resolving. I have thought so much\r\nof my mother, and of Clara, since Mr. Prendergast told me all this,\r\nthat--that--that--" And then a slight gurgling struggle fell upon his\r\nthroat and hindered him from speaking. He did not quite sob out, and\r\nhe determined that he would not do so. If she could be so harsh and\r\nstrong, he would be harsh and strong also.\r\n\r\nAnd again Lady Desmond sat silent, still thinking how she had better\r\nspeak and act. After all she was not so cruel nor so bad as Herbert\r\nFitzgerald thought her. What had the Fitzgeralds done for her that\r\nshe should sorrow for their sorrows? She had lived there, in that old\r\nugly barrack, long desolate, full of dreary wretchedness and poverty,\r\nand Lady Fitzgerald in her prosperity had never come to her to soften\r\nthe hardness of her life. She had come over to Ireland a countess,\r\nand a countess she had been, proud enough at first in her little\r\nglory--too proud, no doubt; and proud enough afterwards in her\r\nloneliness and poverty; and there she had lived--alone. Whether the\r\nfault had been her own or no, she owed little to the kindness of any\r\none; for no one had done aught to relieve her bitterness. And then\r\nher weak puny child had grown up in the same shade, and was now a\r\nlovely woman, gifted with high birth, and that special priceless\r\nbeauty which high blood so often gives. There was a prize now within\r\nthe walls of that old barrack--something to be won--something for\r\nwhich a man would strive, and a mother smile that her son might win\r\nit. And now Lady Fitzgerald had come to her. She had never complained\r\nof this, she said to herself. The bargain between Clara Desmond and\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald had been good for both of them, and let it be\r\nmade and settled as a bargain. Young Herbert Fitzgerald had money\r\nand position; her daughter had beauty and high blood. Let it be a\r\nbargain. But in all this there was nothing to make her love that rich\r\nprosperous family at Castle Richmond. There are those whose nature\r\nit is to love new-found friends at a few hours\' warning, but the\r\nCountess of Desmond was not one of them. The bargain had been made,\r\nand her daughter would have been able to perform her part of it. She\r\nwas still able to give that which she had stipulated to give. But\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald was now a bankrupt, and could give nothing! Would\r\nit not have been madness to suppose that the bargain should still\r\nhold good?\r\n\r\nOne person and one only had come to her at Desmond Court, whose\r\ncoming had been a solace to her weariness. Of all those among whom\r\nshe had lived in cold desolateness for so many years, one only had\r\ngot near her heart. There had been but one Irish voice that she\r\nhad cared to hear; and the owner of that voice had loved her child\r\ninstead of loving her.\r\n\r\nAnd she had borne that wretchedness too, if not well, at least\r\nbravely. True she had separated that lover from her daughter; but the\r\ncircumstances of both had made it right for her, as a mother, to do\r\nso. What mother, circumstanced as she had been, would have given her\r\ngirl to Owen Fitzgerald? So she had banished from the house the only\r\nvoice that sounded sweetly in her ears, and again she had been alone.\r\n\r\nAnd then, perhaps, thoughts had come to her, when Herbert Fitzgerald\r\nwas frequent about the place, a rich and thriving wooer, that Owen\r\nmight come again to Desmond Court, when Clara had gone to Castle\r\nRichmond. Years were stealing over her. Ah, yes. She knew that full\r\nwell. All her youth and the pride of her days she had given up for\r\nthat countess-ship which she now wore so gloomily--given up for\r\npieces of gold which had turned to stone and slate and dirt within\r\nher grasp. Years, alas, were fast stealing over her! But nevertheless\r\nshe had something to give. Her woman\'s beauty was not all faded; and\r\nshe had a heart which was as yet virgin--which had hitherto loved\r\nno other man. Might not that suffice to cover a few years, seeing\r\nthat in return she wanted nothing but love? And so she had thought,\r\nlingering over her hopes, while Herbert was there at his wooing.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined with what feelings at her heart she had seen and\r\nlistened to the frantic attempt made by Owen to get back his childish\r\nlove. But that too she had borne, bravely, if not well. It had not\r\nangered her that her child was loved by the only man she had ever\r\nloved herself. She had stroked her daughter\'s hair that day, and\r\nkissed her cheek, and bade her be happy with her better, richer\r\nlover. And had she not been right in this? Nor had she been angry\r\neven with Owen. She could forgive him all, because she loved him. But\r\nmight there not even yet be a chance for her when Clara should in\r\nvery truth have gone to Castle Richmond?\r\n\r\nBut now! How was she to think about all this now? And thinking of\r\nthese things, how was it possible that she should have heart left to\r\nfeel for the miseries of Lady Fitzgerald? With all her miseries would\r\nnot Lady Fitzgerald still be more fortunate than she? Let come what\r\nmight, Lady Fitzgerald had had a life of prosperity and love. No; she\r\ncould not think of Lady Fitzgerald, nor of Herbert: she could only\r\nthink of Owen Fitzgerald, of her daughter, and of herself.\r\n\r\nHe, Owen, was now the heir to Castle Richmond, and would, as far\r\nas she could learn, soon become the actual possessor. He, who had\r\nbeen cast forth from Desmond Court as too poor and contemptible in\r\nthe world\'s eye to be her daughter\'s suitor, would become the rich\r\ninheritor of all those broad acres, and that old coveted family\r\nhonour. And this Owen still loved her daughter--loved her not as\r\nHerbert did, with a quiet, gentleman-like, every-day attachment, but\r\nwith the old, true, passionate love of which she had read in books,\r\nand dreamed herself, before she had sold herself to be a countess.\r\nThat Owen did so love her daughter, she was very sure. And then, as\r\nto her daughter; that she did not still love this new heir in her\r\nheart of hearts--of that the mother was by no means sure. That her\r\nchild had chosen the better part in choosing money and a title, she\r\nhad not doubted; and that having so chosen Clara would be happy,--of\r\nthat also she did not doubt. Clara was young, she would say, and her\r\nheart in a few months would follow her hand.\r\n\r\nBut now! How was she to decide, sitting there with Herbert Fitzgerald\r\nbefore her, gloomy as death, cold, shivering, and muddy, telling of\r\nhis own disasters with no more courage than a whipped dog? As she\r\nlooked at him she declared to herself twenty times in half a second\r\nthat he had not about him a tithe of the manhood of his cousin Owen.\r\nWomen love a bold front, and a voice that will never own its master\r\nto have been beaten in the world\'s fight. Had Owen came there with\r\nsuch a story, he would have claimed his right boldly to the lady\'s\r\nhand, in spite of all that the world had done to him.\r\n\r\n"Let her have him," said Lady Desmond to herself; and the struggle\r\nwithin her bosom was made and over. No wonder that Herbert, looking\r\ninto her face for pity, should find that she was harsh and cruel. She\r\nhad been sacrificing herself, and had completed the sacrifice. Owen\r\nFitzgerald, the heir to Castle Richmond, Sir Owen as he would soon\r\nbe, should have her daughter. They two, at any rate, should be happy.\r\nAnd she--she would live there at Desmond Court, lonely as she had\r\never lived. While all this was passing through her mind, she hardly\r\nthought of Herbert and his sorrows. That he must be given up and\r\nabandoned, and left to make what best fight he could by himself; as\r\nto that how was it possible that she as a mother should have any\r\ndoubt?\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was a pity--a thousand pities. Herbert Fitzgerald, with\r\nhis domestic virtues, his industry and thorough respectability, would\r\nso exactly have suited Clara\'s taste and mode of life--had he only\r\ncontinued to be the heir of Castle Richmond. She and Owen would not\r\nenter upon the world together with nearly the same fair chance of\r\nhappiness. Who could prophecy to what Owen might be led with his\r\npassionate impulses, his strong will, his unbridled temper, and his\r\nlove of pleasure? That he was noble-hearted, affectionate, brave, and\r\ntender in his inmost spirit, Lady Desmond was very sure; but were\r\nsuch the qualities which would make her daughter happy? When Clara\r\nshould come to know her future lord as Clara\'s mother knew him, would\r\nClara love him and worship him as her mother did? The mother believed\r\nthat Clara had not in her bosom heart enough for such a love. But\r\nthen, as I have said before, the mother did not know the daughter.\r\n\r\n"You say that you will break all this to Clara," said Herbert, having\r\nduring this silence turned over some of his thoughts also in his\r\nmind. "If so I may as well leave you now. You can imagine that I am\r\nanxious to get back to my mother."\r\n\r\n"Yes, it will be better that I should tell her. It is very sad, very\r\nsad, very sad indeed."\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is a hard load for a man to bear," he answered, speaking\r\nvery, very slowly. "But for myself I think I can bear it, if--"\r\n\r\n"If what?" asked the countess.\r\n\r\n"If Clara can bear it."\r\n\r\nAnd now it was necessary that Lady Desmond should speak out. She did\r\nnot mean to be unnecessarily harsh; but she did mean to be decided,\r\nand as she spoke her face became stern and ill-favoured. "That\r\nClara will be terribly distressed," she said, "terribly, terribly\r\ndistressed," repeating her words with great emphasis, "of that I am\r\nquite sure. She is very young, and will, I hope, in time get over it.\r\nAnd then too I think she is one whose feelings, young as she is, have\r\nnever conquered her judgment. Therefore I do believe that, with God\'s\r\nmercy, she will be able to bear it. But, Mr. Fitzgerald--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"Of course you feel with me--and I am sure that with your excellent\r\njudgment it is a thing of course--that everything must be over\r\nbetween you and Lady Clara." And then she came to a full stop as\r\nthough all had been said that could be considered necessary.\r\n\r\nHerbert did not answer at once, but stood there shivering and shaking\r\nin his misery. He was all but overcome by the chill of his wet\r\ngarments; and though he struggled to throw off the dead feeling of\r\nutter cold which struck him to the heart, he was quite unable to\r\nmaster it. He could hardly forgive himself that on such an occasion\r\nhe should have been so conquered by his own outer feelings, but now\r\nhe could not help himself. He was weak with hunger too--though he did\r\nnot know it, for he had hardly eaten food that day, and was nearly\r\nexhausted with the unaccustomed amount of hard exercise which he had\r\ntaken. He was moreover thoroughly wet through, and heavy laden with\r\nthe mud of the road. It was no wonder that Lady Desmond had said to\r\nherself that he looked like a whipped dog.\r\n\r\n"That must be as Lady Clara shall decide," he said at last, barely\r\nuttering the words through his chattering teeth.\r\n\r\n"It must be as I say," said the countess firmly; "whether by her\r\ndecision or by yours--or if necessary by mine. But if your feelings\r\nare, as I take them to be, those of a man of honour, you will not\r\nleave it to me or to her. What! now that you have the world to\r\nstruggle with, would you seek to drag her down into the struggle?"\r\n\r\n"Our union was to be for better or worse. I would have given her all\r\nthe better, and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and had there been a union she would have bravely borne her\r\npart in sharing the worst. But who ought to be so thankful as you\r\nthat this truth has broken upon you before you had clogged yourself\r\nwith a wife of high birth but without fortune? Alone, a man educated\r\nas you are, with your talents, may face the world without fearing\r\nanything. But how could you make your way now if my daughter were\r\nyour wife? When you think of it, Mr. Fitzgerald, you will cease to\r\nwish for it."\r\n\r\n"Never; I have given my heart to your daughter, and I cannot take\r\nback the gift. She has accepted it, and she cannot return it."\r\n\r\n"And what would you have her do?" Lady Desmond asked, with anger and\r\nalmost passion in her voice.\r\n\r\n"Wait--as I must wait," said Herbert. "That will be her duty, as I\r\nbelieve it will also be her wish."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and wear out her young heart here in solitude for the next\r\nten years, and then learn when her beauty and her youth are gone--.\r\nBut no, Mr. Fitzgerald; I will not allow myself to contemplate\r\nsuch a prospect either for her or for you. Under the lamentable\r\ncircumstances which you have now told me it is imperative that this\r\nmatch should be broken off. Ask your own mother and hear what she\r\nwill say. And if you are a man you will not throw upon my poor child\r\nthe hard task of declaring that it must be so. You, by your calamity,\r\nare unable to perform your contract with her; and it is for you to\r\nannounce that that contract is therefore over."\r\n\r\nHerbert in his present state was unable to argue with Lady Desmond.\r\nHe had in his brain, and mind, and heart, and soul--at least so he\r\nsaid to himself afterwards, having perhaps but a loose idea of the\r\ndifferent functions of these four different properties--a thorough\r\nconviction that as he and Clara had sworn to each other that for life\r\nthey would live together and love each other, no misfortune to either\r\nof them could justify the other in breaking that oath;--could even\r\njustify him in breaking it, though he was the one on whom misfortune\r\nhad fallen. He, no doubt, had first loved Clara for her beauty; but\r\nwould he have ceased to love her, or have cast her from him, if,\r\nby God\'s will, her beauty had perished and gone from her? Would he\r\nnot have held her closer to his heart, and told her, with strong\r\ncomforting vows, that his love had now gone deeper than that; that\r\nthey were already of the same bone, of the same flesh, of the same\r\nfamily and hearthstone? He knew himself in this, and knew that he\r\nwould have been proud so to do, and so to feel,--that he would have\r\ncast from him with utter indignation any who would have counselled\r\nhim to do or to feel differently. And why should Clara\'s heart be\r\ndifferent from his?\r\n\r\nAll this, I say, was his strong conviction. But, nevertheless, her\r\nheart might be different. She might look on that engagement of theirs\r\nwith altogether other thoughts and other ideas; and if so his voice\r\nshould never reproach her;--not his voice, however his heart might\r\ndo so. Such might be the case with her, but he did not think it; and\r\ntherefore he would not pronounce that decision which Clara\'s mother\r\nexpected from him.\r\n\r\n"When you have told her of this, I suppose I may be allowed to see\r\nher," he said, avoiding the direct proposition which Lady Desmond had\r\nmade to him.\r\n\r\n"Allowed to see her?" said Lady Desmond, now also in her turn\r\nspeaking very slowly. "I cannot answer that question as yet; not\r\nquite immediately, I should say. But if you will leave the matter in\r\nmy hands, I will write to you, if not to-morrow, then the next day."\r\n\r\n"I would sooner that she should write."\r\n\r\n"I cannot promise that--I do not know how far her good sense and\r\nstrength may support her under this affliction. That she will suffer\r\nterribly, on your account as well as on her own, you may be quite\r\nsure." And then, again, there was a pause of some moments.\r\n\r\n"I at any rate shall write to her," he then said, "and shall tell\r\nher that I expect her to see me. Her will in this matter shall be my\r\nwill. If she thinks that her misery will be greater in being engaged\r\nto a poor man, than,--than in relinquishing her love, she shall hear\r\nno word from me to overpersuade her. But, Lady Desmond, I will say\r\nnothing that shall authorize her to think that she is given up by me,\r\ntill I have in some way learned from herself, what her own feelings\r\nare. And now I will say good-bye to you."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," said the countess, thinking that it might be as well that\r\nthe interview should be ended. "But, Mr. Fitzgerald, you are very\r\nwet; and I fear that you are very cold. You had better take something\r\nbefore you go." Countess as she was she had no carriage in which she\r\ncould send him home; no horse even on which he could ride. "Nothing,\r\nthank you, Lady Desmond," he said; and so, without offering her the\r\ncourtesy of his hand he walked out of the room.\r\n\r\nHe was very angry with her, as he tried to make the blood run\r\nquicker in his veins by hurrying down the avenue into the road at\r\nhis quickest pace. So angry with her, that for a while, in his\r\nindignation, he almost forgot his father and his mother and his own\r\nfamily tragedy. That she should have wished to save her daughter\r\nfrom such a marriage might have been natural; but that she should\r\nhave treated him so coldly, so harshly--without one spark of love\r\nor pity,--him, who to her had been so loyal during his courtship of\r\nher daughter! It was almost incredible to him. Was not his story one\r\nthat would have melted the heart of a stranger--at which men would\r\nweep? He himself had seen tears in the eyes of that dry time-worn\r\nworld-used London lawyer, as the full depth of the calamity had\r\nforced itself upon his heart. Yes, Mr. Prendergast had not been able\r\nto repress his tears when he told the tale; but Lady Desmond had shed\r\nno tears when the tale had been told to her. No soft woman\'s message\r\nhad been sent to the afflicted mother on whom it had pleased God to\r\nallow so heavy a hand to fall. No word of tenderness had been uttered\r\nfor the sinking father. There had been no feeling for the household\r\nwhich was to have been so nearly linked with her own. No. Looking\r\nround with greedy eyes for wealth for her daughter, Lady Desmond\r\nhad found a match that suited her. Now that match no longer suited\r\nher greed, and she could throw from her without a struggle to her\r\nfeelings the suitor that was now poor, and the family of the suitor\r\nthat was now neither grand nor powerful.\r\n\r\nAnd then too he felt angry with Clara, though he knew that as yet, at\r\nany rate, he had no cause. In spite of what he had said and felt, he\r\nwould imagine to himself that she also would be cold and untrue. "Let\r\nher go," he said to himself. "Love is worth nothing--nothing if it\r\ndoes not believe itself to be of more worth than everything beside.\r\nIf she does not love me now in my misery--if she would not choose me\r\nnow for her husband--her love has never been worthy the name. Love\r\nthat has no faith in itself, that does not value itself above all\r\nworldly things, is nothing. If it be not so with her, let her go back\r\nto him."\r\n\r\nIt may easily be understood who was the him. And then Herbert walked\r\non so rapidly that at length his strength almost failed him, and in\r\nhis exhaustion he had more than once to lean against a gate on the\r\nroad-side. With difficulty at last he got home, and dragged himself\r\nup the long avenue to the front door. Even yet he was not warm\r\nthrough to his heart, and he felt as he entered the house that he was\r\nquite unfitted for the work which he might yet have to do before he\r\ncould go to his bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nCOMFORTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert Fitzgerald got back to Castle Richmond it was nearly\r\ndark. He opened the hall door without ringing the bell, and walking\r\nat once into the dining-room, threw himself into a large leathern\r\nchair which always stood near the fire-place. There was a bright fire\r\nburning on the hearth, and he drew himself close to it, putting his\r\nwet feet up on to the fender, thinking that he would at any rate warm\r\nhimself before he went in among any of the family. The room, with\r\nits deep red curtains and ruby-embossed paper, was almost dark, and\r\nhe knew that he might remain there unseen and unnoticed for the\r\nnext half hour. If he could only get a glass of wine! He tried the\r\ncellaret, which was as often open as locked, but now unfortunately\r\nit was closed. In such a case it was impossible to say whether the\r\nbutler had the key or Aunt Letty; so he sat himself down without that\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nBy this time, as he well knew, all would have been told to his\r\nmother, and his first duty would be to go to her--to go to her and\r\ncomfort her, if comfort might be possible, by telling her that he\r\ncould bear it all; that as far as he was concerned title and wealth\r\nand a proud name were as nothing to him in comparison with his\r\nmother\'s love. In whatever guise he may have appeared before Lady\r\nDesmond, he would not go to his mother with a fainting heart. She\r\nshould not hear his teeth chatter, nor see his limbs shake. So he sat\r\nhimself down there that he might become warm, and in five minutes he\r\nwas fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHow long he slept he did not know; not very long, probably; but\r\nwhen he awoke it was quite dark. He gazed at the fire for a moment,\r\nbethought himself of where he was and why, shook himself to get rid\r\nof his slumber, and then roused himself in his chair. As he did so a\r\nsoft sweet voice close to his shoulder spoke to him. "Herbert," it\r\nsaid, "are you awake?" And he found that his mother, seated by his\r\nside on a low stool, had been watching him in his sleep.\r\n\r\n"Mother!" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Herbert, my child, my son!" And the mother and son were fast locked\r\nin each other\'s arms.\r\n\r\nHe had sat down there thinking how he would go to his mother and\r\noffer her solace in her sorrow; how he would bid her be of good\r\ncheer, and encourage her to bear the world as the world had now\r\nfallen to her lot. He had pictured to himself that he would find\r\nher sinking in despair, and had promised himself that with his\r\nvows, his kisses, and his prayers, he would bring her back to her\r\nself-confidence, and induce her to acknowledge that God\'s mercy was\r\nyet good to her. But now, on awakening, he discovered that she had\r\nbeen tending him in his misery, and watching him while he slept, that\r\nshe might comfort him with her caresses the moment that he awoke to\r\nthe remembrance of his misfortunes.\r\n\r\n"Herbert, Herbert, my son, my son!" she said again, as she pressed\r\nhim close in her arms.\r\n\r\n"Mother, has he told you?"\r\n\r\nYes, she had learned it all; but hardly more than she had known\r\nbefore; or, at any rate, not more than she had expected. As she now\r\ntold him, for many days past she had felt that this trouble which had\r\nfallen upon his father must have come from the circumstances of their\r\nmarriage. And she would have spoken out, she said, when the idea\r\nbecame clear to her, had she not then been told that Mr. Prendergast\r\nhad been invited to come thither from London. Then she knew that she\r\nhad better remain silent, at any rate till his visit had been made.\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert again sat in the chair, and his mother crouched, or\r\nalmost kneeled, on the cushion at his knee. "Dearest, dearest,\r\ndearest mother," he said, as he supported her head against his\r\nshoulder, "we must love each other now more than ever we have loved."\r\n\r\n"And you forgive us, Herbert, for all that we have done to you?"\r\n\r\n"Mother, if you speak in that way to me you will kill me. My darling,\r\ndarling mother!"\r\n\r\nThere was but little more said between them upon the matter--but\r\nlittle more, at least, in words; but there was an infinity of\r\ncaresses, and deep--deep assurances of undying love and confidence.\r\nAnd then she asked him about his bride, and he told her where he\r\nhad been, and what had happened. "You must not claim her, Herbert,"\r\nshe said to him. "God is good, and will teach you to bear even that\r\nalso."\r\n\r\n"Must I not?" he asked, with a sadly plaintive voice.\r\n\r\n"No, my child. You invited her to share your prosperity, and would it\r\nbe just--"\r\n\r\n"But, mother, if she wills it?"\r\n\r\n"It is for you to give her back her troth, then leave it to time and\r\nher own heart."\r\n\r\n"But if she love me, mother, she will not take back her troth. Would\r\nI take back hers because she was in sorrow?"\r\n\r\n"Men and women, Herbert, are different. The oak cares not whether the\r\ncreeper which hangs to it be weak or strong. If it be weak the oak\r\ncan give it strength. But the staff which has to support the creeper\r\nmust needs have strength of its own."\r\n\r\nHe made no further answer to her, but understood that he must do as\r\nshe bade him. He understood now also, without many arguments within\r\nhimself, that he had no right to expect from Clara Desmond that\r\nadherence to him and his misfortunes which he would have owed to her\r\nhad she been unfortunate. He understood this now; but still he hoped.\r\n"Two hearts that have once become as one cannot be separated," he\r\nsaid to himself that night, as he resolved that it was his duty to\r\nwrite to her, unconditionally returning to her her pledges.\r\n\r\n"But, Herbert, what a state you are in!" said Lady Fitzgerald, as\r\nthe flame of the coal glimmering out, threw a faint light upon his\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother; I have been walking."\r\n\r\n"And you are wet!"\r\n\r\n"I am nearly dry now. I was wet. But, mother, I am tired and fagged.\r\nIt would do me good if I could get a glass of wine."\r\n\r\nShe rang the bell, and gave her orders calmly--though every servant\r\nin the house now knew the whole truth,--and then lit a candle\r\nherself, and looked at him. "My child, what have you done to\r\nyourself? Oh, Herbert, you will be ill!" And then, with his arm round\r\nher waist, she took him up to her own room, and sat by him while he\r\ntook off his muddy boots and clammy socks, and made him hot drinks,\r\nand tended him as she had done when he was a child. And yet she\r\nhad that day heard of her great ruin! With truth, indeed, had Mr.\r\nPrendergast said that she was made of more enduring material than Sir\r\nThomas.\r\n\r\nAnd she endeavoured to persuade him to go to his bed; but in this he\r\nwould not listen to her. He must, he said, see his father that night.\r\n"You have been with him, mother, since--since--."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; directly after Mr. Prendergast left me."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"He cried like a child, Herbert. We both sobbed together like two\r\nchildren. It was very piteous. But I think I left him better than he\r\nhas been. He knows now that those men cannot come again to harass\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nHerbert gnashed his teeth, and clenched his fist as he thought of\r\nthem; but he could not speak of them, or mention their name before\r\nhis mother. What must her thoughts be, as she remembered that elder\r\nman and looked back to her early childhood!\r\n\r\n"He is very weak," she went on to say: "almost helplessly weak now,\r\nand does not seem to think of leaving his bed. I have begged him to\r\nlet me send to Dublin for Sir Henry; but he says that nothing ails\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"And who is with him now, mother?"\r\n\r\n"The girls are both there."\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Prendergast?"\r\n\r\nLady Fitzgerald then explained to him, that Mr. Prendergast had\r\nreturned to Dublin that afternoon, starting twenty-four hours\r\nearlier than he intended,--or, at any rate, than he had said that\r\nhe intended. Having done his work there, he had felt that he would\r\nnow only be in the way. And, moreover, though his work was done at\r\nCastle Richmond, other work in the same matter had still to be done\r\nin England. Mr. Prendergast had very little doubt as to the truth\r\nof Mollett\'s story;--indeed we may say he had no doubt; otherwise\r\nhe would hardly have made it known to all that world round Castle\r\nRichmond. But nevertheless it behoved him thoroughly to sift the\r\nmatter. He felt tolerably sure that he should find Mollett in London;\r\nand whether he did or no, he should be able to identify, or not to\r\nidentify, that scoundrel with the Mr. Talbot who had hired Chevy\r\nChase Lodge, in Dorsetshire, and who had undoubtedly married poor\r\nMary Wainwright.\r\n\r\n"He left a kind message for you," said Lady Fitzgerald.--My readers\r\nmust excuse me if I still call her Lady Fitzgerald, for I cannot\r\nbring my pen to the use of any other name. And it was so also with\r\nthe dependents and neighbours of Castle Richmond, when the time came\r\nthat the poor lady felt that she was bound publicly to drop her\r\ntitle. It was not in her power to drop it; no effort that she could\r\nmake would induce those around her to call her by another name.\r\n\r\n"He bade me say," she continued, "that if your future course of life\r\nshould take you to London, you are to go to him, and look to him as\r\nanother father. He has no child of his own," he said, "and you shall\r\nbe to him as a son."\r\n\r\n"I will be no one\'s son but yours,--yours and my father\'s," he said,\r\nagain embracing her.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when, under his mother\'s eye, he had eaten and drank and\r\nmade himself warm, he did go to his father and found both his sisters\r\nsitting there. They came and clustered round him, taking hold of\r\nhis hands and looking up into his face, loving him, and pitying\r\nhim, and caressing him with their eyes; but standing there by their\r\nfather\'s bed, they said little or nothing. Nor did Sir Thomas say\r\nmuch;--except this, indeed, that, just as Herbert was leaving him,\r\nhe declared with a faint voice, that henceforth his son should be\r\nmaster of that house, and the disposer of that property--"As long as\r\nI live!" he exclaimed with his weak voice; "as long as I live!"\r\n\r\n"No, father; not so."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes! as long as I live. It will be little that you will have,\r\neven so--very little. But so it shall be as long as I live."\r\n\r\nVery little indeed, poor man, for, alas! his days were numbered.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when Herbert left the room, Emmeline followed him. She had\r\never been his dearest sister, and now she longed to be with him that\r\nshe might tell him how she loved him, and comfort him with her tears.\r\nAnd Clara too--Clara whom she had welcomed as a sister!--she must\r\nlearn now how Clara would behave, for she had already made herself\r\nsure that her brother had been at Desmond Court, the herald of his\r\nown ruin.\r\n\r\n"May I come with you, Herbert?" she asked, closing in round him and\r\ngetting under his arm. How could he refuse her? So they went together\r\nand sat over a fire in a small room that was sacred to her and her\r\nsister, and there, with many sobs on her part and much would-be brave\r\ncontempt of poverty on his, they talked over the altered world as it\r\nnow showed itself before them.\r\n\r\n"And you did not see her?" she asked, when with many efforts she had\r\nbrought the subject round to Clara Desmond and her brother\'s walk to\r\nDesmond Court.\r\n\r\n"No; she left the room at my own bidding. I could not have told it\r\nmyself to her."\r\n\r\n"And you cannot know then what she would say?"\r\n\r\n"No, I cannot know what she would say; but I know now what I must\r\nsay myself. All that is over, Emmeline. I cannot ask her to marry a\r\nbeggar."\r\n\r\n"Ask her; no! there will be no need of asking her; she has already\r\ngiven you her promise. You do not think that she will desert you? you\r\ndo not wish it?"\r\n\r\nHerein were contained two distinct questions, the latter of which\r\nHerbert did not care to answer. "I shall not call it desertion," he\r\nsaid; "indeed the proposal will come from me. I shall write to her,\r\ntelling her that she need think about me no longer. Only that I am so\r\nweary I would do it now."\r\n\r\n"And how will she answer you? If she is the Clara that I take her\r\nfor she will throw your proposal back into your face. She will tell\r\nyou that it is not in your power to reject her now. She will swear\r\nto you, that let your words be what they may, she will think of\r\nyou--more now than she has ever thought in better days. She will tell\r\nyou of her love in words that she could not use before. I know she\r\nwill. I know that she is good, and true, and honest, and generous.\r\nOh, I should die if I thought she were false! But, Herbert, I am sure\r\nthat she is true. You can write your letter, and we shall see."\r\n\r\nHerbert, with wise arguments learned from his mother, reasoned with\r\nhis sister, explaining to her that Clara was now by no means bound to\r\ncling to him; but as he spoke them his arm fastened itself closely\r\nround his sister\'s waist, for the words which she uttered with so\r\nmuch energy were comfortable to him.\r\n\r\nAnd then, seated there, before he moved from the room, he made her\r\nbring him pens, ink, and paper, and he wrote his letter to Clara\r\nDesmond. She would fain have stayed with him while he did so, sitting\r\nat his feet, and looking into his face, and trying to encourage his\r\nhope as to what Clara\'s answer might be; but this he would not allow;\r\nso she went again to her father\'s room, having succeeded in obtaining\r\na promise that Clara\'s answer should be shown to her. And the letter,\r\nwhen it was written, copied, and recopied, ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Castle Richmond, ---- night.\r\n\r\n   My dearest Clara,--\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with great difficulty that he could satisfy himself with that,\r\nor indeed with any other mode of commencement. In the short little\r\nlove-notes which had hitherto gone from him, sent from house to\r\nhouse, he had written to her with appellations of endearment of his\r\nown--as all lovers do; and as all lovers seem to think that no lovers\r\nhave done before themselves--with appellations which are so sweet to\r\nthose who write, and so musical to those who read, but which sound\r\nso ludicrous when barbarously made public in hideous law courts by\r\nbrazen-browed lawyers with mercenary tongues. In this way only had\r\nhe written, and each of these sweet silly songs of love had been as\r\nfull of honey as words could make it. But he had never yet written to\r\nher, on a full sheet of paper, a sensible positive letter containing\r\nthoughts and facts, as men do write to women and women also to men,\r\nwhen the lollypops and candied sugar-drops of early love have passed\r\naway. Now he was to write his first serious letter to her,--and\r\nprobably his last,--and it was with difficulty that he could get\r\nhimself over the first three words; but there they were decided on at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\r\n   My dearest Clara,\r\n\r\n   Before you get this your mother will have told you\r\n   all that which I could not bring myself to speak out\r\n   yesterday, as long as you were in the room. I am sure you\r\n   will understand now why I begged you to go away, and will\r\n   not think the worse of me for doing so. You now know the\r\n   whole truth, and I am sure that you will feel for us all\r\n   here.\r\n\r\n   Having thought a good deal upon the matter, chiefly during\r\n   my walk home from Desmond Court, and indeed since I\r\n   have been at home, I have come to the resolution that\r\n   everything between us must be over. It would be unmanly\r\n   in me to wish to ruin you because I myself am ruined. Our\r\n   engagement was, of course, made on the presumption that\r\n   I should inherit my father\'s estate; as it is I shall\r\n   not do so, and therefore I beg that you will regard that\r\n   engagement as at an end. Of my own love for you I will say\r\n   nothing. But I know that you have loved me truly, and that\r\n   all this, therefore, will cause you great grief. It is\r\n   better, however, that it should be so, than that I should\r\n   seek to hold you to a promise which was made under such\r\n   different circumstances.\r\n\r\n   You will, of course, show this letter to your mother. She,\r\n   at any rate, will approve of what I am now doing; and so\r\n   will you when you allow yourself to consider it calmly.\r\n\r\n   We have not known each other so long that there is much\r\n   for us to give back to each other. If you do not think it\r\n   wrong I should like still to keep that lock of your hair,\r\n   to remind me of my first love--and, as I think, my only\r\n   one. And you, I hope, will not be afraid to have near you\r\n   the one little present that I made you.\r\n\r\n   And now, dearest Clara, good-bye. Let us always think,\r\n   each of the other, as of a very dear friend. May God bless\r\n   you, and preserve you, and make you happy.\r\n\r\n   Yours, with sincere affection,\r\n\r\n   HERBERT FITZGERALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, when at last he had succeeded in writing it, he read over and\r\nover again; but on each occasion he said to himself that it was\r\ncold and passionless, stilted and unmeaning. It by no means pleased\r\nhim, and seemed as though it could bring but one answer--a cold\r\nacquiescence in the proposal which he so coldly made. But yet he knew\r\nnot how to improve it. And after all it was a true exposition of\r\nthat which he had determined to say. All the world--her world and\r\nhis world--would think it better that they should part; and let the\r\nstruggle cost him what it would, he would teach himself to wish\r\nthat it might be so--if not for his own sake, then for hers. So he\r\nfastened the letter, and taking it with him determined to send it\r\nover, so that it should reach Clara quite early on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAnd then having once more visited his father, and once more kissed\r\nhis mother, he betook himself to bed. It had been with him one of\r\nthose days which seem to pass away without reference to usual hours\r\nand periods. It had been long dark, and he seemed to have been\r\nhanging about the house, doing nothing and aiding nobody, till he\r\nwas weary of himself. So he went off to bed, almost wondering, as he\r\nbethought himself of what had happened to him within the last two\r\ndays, that he was able to bear the burden of his life so easily as he\r\ndid. He betook himself to bed; and with the letter close at his hand,\r\nso that he might despatch it when he awoke, he was soon asleep. After\r\nall, that walk, terrible as it had been, was in the end serviceable\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nHe slept without waking till the light of the February morning was\r\nbeginning to dawn into his room, and then he was roused by a servant\r\nknocking at the door. It was grievous enough, that awaking to his\r\nsorrow after the pleasant dreams of the night.\r\n\r\n"Here is a letter, Mr. Herbert, from Desmond Court," said Richard.\r\n"The boy as brought it says as how--"\r\n\r\n"A letter from Desmond Court," said Herbert, putting out his hand\r\ngreedily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Herbert. The boy\'s been here this hour and better. I warn\'t\r\njust up and about myself, or I wouldn\'t have let \'em keep it from\r\nyou, not half a minute."\r\n\r\n"And where is he? I have a letter to send to Desmond Court. But never\r\nmind. Perhaps--"\r\n\r\n"It\'s no good minding, for the gossoon\'s gone back any ways." And\r\nthen Richard, having drawn the blind, and placed a little table by\r\nthe bed-head, left his young master to read the despatch from Desmond\r\nCourt. Herbert, till he saw the writing, feared that it was from the\r\ncountess; but the letter was from Clara. She also had thought good to\r\nwrite before she betook herself to bed, and she had been earlier in\r\ndespatching her messenger. Here is her letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n   Dear Herbert, my own Herbert,\r\n\r\n   I have heard it all. But remember this; nothing, nothing,\r\n   _nothing_ can make any change between you and me. I will\r\n   hear of no arguments that are to separate us. I know\r\n   beforehand what you will say, but I will not regard\r\n   it--not in the least. I love you ten times the more for\r\n   all your unhappiness; and as I would have shared your good\r\n   fortune, I claim my right to share your bad fortune. _Pray\r\n   believe me_, that nothing shall turn me from this; for I\r\n   will _not be given up_.\r\n\r\n   Give my kindest love to your dear, dear, dearest\r\n   mother--my mother, as she is and must be; and to my\r\n   darling girls. I do so wish I could be with them, and with\r\n   you, my own Herbert. I cannot help writing in confusion,\r\n   but I will explain all when I see you. I have been so\r\n   unhappy.\r\n\r\n   Your own faithful\r\n\r\n   CLARA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving read this, Herbert Fitzgerald, in spite of his affliction, was\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nFOR A\' THAT AND A\' THAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHerbert as he started from his bed with this letter in his hand felt\r\nthat he could yet hold up his head against all that the world could\r\ndo to him. How could he be really unhappy while he possessed such an\r\nassurance of love as this, and while his mother was able to give him\r\nso glorious an example of endurance? He was not really unhappy. The\r\nlow-spirited broken-hearted wretchedness of the preceding day seemed\r\nto have departed from him as he hurried on his clothes, and went off\r\nto his sister\'s room that he might show his letter to Emmeline in\r\naccordance with the promise he had made her.\r\n\r\n"May I come in?" he said, knocking at the door. "I must come in,\r\nfor I have something to show you." But the two girls were dressing\r\nand he could not be admitted. Emmeline, however, promised to come\r\nto him, and in about three minutes she was out in the cold little\r\nsitting-room which adjoined their bed-room with her slippers on, and\r\nher dressing gown wrapped round her, an object presentable to no male\r\neyes but those of her brother.\r\n\r\n"Emmeline," said he, "I have got a letter this morning."\r\n\r\n"Not from Clara?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, from Clara. There; you may read it;" and he handed her the\r\nprecious epistle.\r\n\r\n"But she could not have got your letter?" said Emmeline, before she\r\nlooked at the one in her hand.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not, for I have it here. I must write another now; but in\r\ntruth I do not know what to say. I can be as generous as she is."\r\n\r\nAnd then his sister read the letter. "My own Clara!" she exclaimed,\r\nas she saw what was the tenor of it. "Did I not tell you so, Herbert?\r\nI knew well what she would do and say. Love you ten times better!--of\r\ncourse she does. What honest girl would not? My own beautiful Clara,\r\nI knew I could depend on her. I did not doubt her for one moment."\r\nBut in this particular it must be acknowledged that Miss Emmeline\r\nFitzgerald hardly confined herself to the strictest veracity, for she\r\nhad lain awake half the night perplexed with doubt. What, oh what,\r\nif Clara should be untrue! Such had been the burden of her doubting\r\nmidnight thoughts. "\'I will not be given up,\'" she continued, quoting\r\nthe letter. "No; of course not. And I tell you what, Herbert, you\r\nmust not dare to talk of giving her up. Money and titles may be\r\ntossed to and fro, but not hearts. How beautifully she speaks of dear\r\nmamma!" and now the tears began to run down the young lady\'s cheeks.\r\n"Oh, I do wish she could be with us! My darling, darling, darling\r\nClara! Unhappy? Yes: I am sure Lady Desmond will give her no peace.\r\nBut never mind. She will be true through it all; and I said so from\r\nthe first." And then she fell to crying, and embracing her brother,\r\nand declaring that nothing now should make her altogether unhappy.\r\n\r\n"But, Emmeline, you must not think that I shall take her at her word.\r\nIt is very generous of her--"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Herbert!" And then there was another torrent of eloquence,\r\nin answering which Herbert found that his arguments were of very\r\nlittle efficacy.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must go back to Desmond Court, and see under what all but\r\noverwhelming difficulties poor Clara wrote her affectionate letter.\r\nAnd in the first place it should be pointed out how very wrong\r\nHerbert had been in going to Desmond Court on foot, through the mud\r\nand rain. A man can hardly bear himself nobly unless his outer aspect\r\nbe in some degree noble. It may be very sad, this having to admit\r\nthat the tailor does in great part make the man; but such I fear is\r\nundoubtedly the fact. Could the Chancellor look dignified on the\r\nwoolsack, if he had had an accident with his wig, or allowed his\r\nrobes to be torn or soiled? Does not half the piety of a bishop\r\nreside in his lawn sleeves, and all his meekness in his anti-virile\r\napron? Had Herbert understood the world he would have had out the\r\nbest pair of horses standing in the Castle Richmond stables, when\r\ngoing to Desmond Court on such an errand. He would have brushed his\r\nhair, and anointed himself; he would have clothed himself in his rich\r\nSpanish cloak; he would have seen that his hat was brushed, and his\r\nboots spotless; and then with all due solemnity but with head erect,\r\nhe would have told his tale out boldly. The countess would still have\r\nwished to be rid of him, hearing that he was a pauper; but she would\r\nhave lacked the courage to turn him from the house as she had done.\r\n\r\nBut seeing how wobegone he was and wretched, how mean to look at, and\r\nlow in his outward presence, she had been able to assume the mastery,\r\nand had kept it throughout the interview. And having done this her\r\nopinion of his prowess naturally became low, and she felt that he\r\nwould have been unable to press his cause against her.\r\n\r\nFor some time after he had departed, she sat alone in the room in\r\nwhich she had received him. She expected every minute that Clara\r\nwould come down to her, still wishing however that she might be left\r\nfor a while alone. But Clara did not come, and she was able to pursue\r\nher thoughts.\r\n\r\nHow very terrible was this tragedy that had fallen out in her close\r\nneighbourhood! That was the first thought that came to her now that\r\nHerbert had left her. How terrible, overwhelming, and fatal! What\r\ncalamity could fall upon a woman so calamitous as this which had\r\nnow overtaken that poor lady at Castle Richmond? Could she live\r\nand support such a burden? Could she bear the eyes of people, when\r\nshe knew the light in which she must be now regarded? To lose at\r\none blow, her name, her pride of place, her woman\'s rank and high\r\nrespect! Could it be possible that she would still live on? It was\r\nthus that Lady Desmond thought; and had any one told her that this\r\ndegraded mother would that very day come down from her room, and sit\r\nwatchful by her sleeping son, in order that she might comfort and\r\nencourage him when he awoke, she would not have found it in her heart\r\nto believe such a marvel. But then Lady Desmond knew but one solace\r\nin her sorrows--had but one comfort in her sad reflections. She was\r\nCountess of Desmond, and that was all. To Lady Fitzgerald had been\r\nvouchsafed other solace and other comforts.\r\n\r\nAnd then, on one point the countess made herself fixed as fate, by\r\nthinking and re-thinking upon it till no doubt remained upon her\r\nmind. The match between Clara and Herbert must be broken off, let\r\nthe cost be what it might; and--a point on which there was more room\r\nfor doubt, and more pain in coming to a conclusion--that other match\r\nwith the more fortunate cousin must be encouraged and carried out.\r\nFor herself, if her hope was small while Owen was needy and of poor\r\naccount, what hope could there be now that he would be rich and\r\ngreat? Moreover, Owen loved Clara, and not herself; and Clara\'s hand\r\nwould once more be vacant and ready for the winning. For herself, her\r\nonly chance had been in Clara\'s coming marriage.\r\n\r\nIn all this she knew that there would be difficulty. She was sure\r\nenough that Clara would at first feel the imprudent generosity of\r\nyouth, and offer to join her poverty to Herbert\'s poverty. That was\r\na matter of course. She, Lady Desmond herself, would have done this,\r\nat Clara\'s age,--so at least to herself she said, and also to her\r\ndaughter. But a little time, and a little patience, and a little care\r\nwould set all this in a proper light. Herbert would go away and would\r\ngradually be forgotten. Owen would again come forth from beneath the\r\nclouds, with renewed splendour; and then, was it not probable that,\r\nin her very heart of hearts, Owen was the man whom Clara had ever\r\nloved?\r\n\r\nAnd thus having realized to herself the facts which Herbert had told\r\nher, she prepared to make them known to her daughter. She got up\r\nfrom her chair, intending at first to seek her, and then, changing\r\nher purpose, rang the bell and sent for her. She was astonished to\r\nfind how violently she herself was affected; not so much by the\r\ncircumstances, as by this duty which had fallen to her of telling\r\nthem to her child. She put one hand upon the other and felt that she\r\nherself was in a tremor, and was conscious that the blood was running\r\nquick round her heart. Clara came down, and going to her customary\r\nseat waited till her mother should speak to her.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald has brought very dreadful news," Lady Desmond said,\r\nafter a minute\'s pause.\r\n\r\n"Oh mamma!" said Clara. She had expected bad tidings, having thought\r\nof all manner of miseries while she had been up stairs alone; but\r\nthere was that in her mother\'s voice which seemed to be worse than\r\nthe worst of her anticipations.\r\n\r\n"Dreadful, indeed, my child! It is my duty to tell them to you;\r\nbut I must caution you, before I do so, to place a guard upon your\r\nfeelings. That which I have to say must necessarily alter all your\r\nfuture prospects, and, unfortunately, make your marrying Herbert\r\nFitzgerald quite impossible."\r\n\r\n"Mamma!" she exclaimed, with a loud voice, jumping from her chair.\r\n"Not marry him! Why; what can he have done? Is it his wish to break\r\nit off?"\r\n\r\nLady Desmond had calculated that she would best effect her object\r\nby at once impressing her daughter with the idea that, under the\r\ncircumstances which were about to be narrated, this marriage would\r\nnot only be imprudent, but altogether impracticable and out of\r\nthe question. Clara must be made to understand at once, that the\r\ncircumstances gave her no option,--that the affair was of such a\r\nnature as to make it a thing manifest to everybody, that she could\r\nnot now marry Herbert Fitzgerald. She must not be left to think\r\nwhether she could, or whether she could not, exercise her own\r\ngenerosity. And therefore, not without discretion, the countess\r\nannounced at once to her the conclusion at which it would be\r\nnecessary to arrive. But Clara was not a girl to adopt such a\r\nconclusion on any other judgment than her own, or to be led in such a\r\nmatter by the feelings of any other person.\r\n\r\n"Sit down, my dear, and I will explain it all. But, dearest Clara,\r\ngrieved as I must be to grieve you, I am bound to tell you again\r\nthat it must be as I say. For both your sakes it must be so; but\r\nespecially, perhaps, for his. But when I have told you my story, you\r\nwill understand that this must be so."\r\n\r\n"Tell me, then, mother." She said this, for Lady Desmond had again\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you sit down, dearest?"\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; it does not matter;" and Clara, at her mother\'s bidding,\r\nsat down, and then the story was told to her.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult tale for a mother to tell to so young a child--to\r\na child whom she had regarded as being so very young. There were\r\nvarious little points of law which she thought that she was obliged\r\nto explain; how it was necessary that the Castle Richmond property\r\nshould go to an heir-at-law, and how it was impossible that Herbert\r\nshould be that heir-at-law, seeing that he had not been born in\r\nlawful wedlock. All these things Lady Desmond attempted to explain,\r\nor was about to attempt such explanation, but desisted on finding\r\nthat her daughter understood them as well as she herself did. And\r\nthen she had to make it also intelligible to Clara that Owen would\r\nbe called on, when Sir Thomas should die, to fill the position and\r\nenjoy the wealth accruing to the heir of Castle Richmond. When Owen\r\nFitzgerald\'s name was mentioned a slight blush came upon Clara\'s\r\ncheek; it was very slight, but nevertheless her mother saw it, and\r\ntook advantage of it to say a word in Owen\'s favour.\r\n\r\n"Poor Owen!" she said. "He will not be the first to triumph in this\r\nchange of fortune."\r\n\r\n"I am sure he will not," said Clara. "He is much too generous for\r\nthat." And then the countess began to hope that the task might not\r\nbe so very difficult. Ignorant woman! Had she been able to read one\r\npage in her daughter\'s heart, she would have known that the task was\r\nimpossible. After that the story was told out to the end without\r\nfurther interruption; and then Clara, hiding her face within her\r\nhands on the head of the sofa, uttered one long piteous moan.\r\n\r\n"It is all very dreadful," said the countess.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Lady Fitzgerald, dear Lady Fitzgerald!" sobbed forth Clara.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. Poor Lady Fitzgerald! Her fate is so dreadful that I\r\nknow not how to think of it."\r\n\r\n"But, mamma--" and as she spoke Clara pushed back from her forehead\r\nher hair with both her hands, showing, as she did so, the form of her\r\nforehead, and the firmness of purpose that was written there, legible\r\nto any eyes that could read. "But, mamma, you are wrong about my not\r\nmarrying Herbert Fitzgerald. Why should I not marry him? Not now, as\r\nwe, perhaps, might have done but for this; but at some future time\r\nwhen he may think himself able to support a wife. Mamma, I shall not\r\nbreak our engagement; certainly not."\r\n\r\nThis was said in a tone of voice so very decided that Lady Desmond\r\nhad to acknowledge to herself that there would be difficulty in her\r\ntask. But she still did not doubt that she would have her way, if\r\nnot by concession on the part of her daughter, then by concession on\r\nthe part of Herbert Fitzgerald. "I can understand your generosity\r\nof feeling, my dear," she said; "and at your age I should probably\r\nhave felt the same. And therefore I do not ask you to take any\r\nsteps towards breaking your engagement. The offer must come from Mr.\r\nFitzgerald, and I have no doubt that it will come. He, as a man of\r\nhonour, will know that he cannot now offer to marry you; and he will\r\nalso know, as a man of sense, that it would be ruin for him to think\r\nof--of such a marriage under his present circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Why, mamma? Why should it be ruin to him?"\r\n\r\n"Why, my dear? Do you think that a wife with a titled name can be of\r\nadvantage to a young man who has not only got his bread to earn, but\r\neven to look out for a way in which he may earn it?"\r\n\r\n"If there be nothing to hurt him but the titled name, that difficulty\r\nshall be easily conquered."\r\n\r\n"Dearest Clara, you know what I mean. You must be aware that a girl\r\nof your rank, and brought up as you have been, cannot be a fitting\r\nwife for a man who will now have to struggle with the world at every\r\nturn."\r\n\r\nClara, as this was said to her, and as she prepared to answer,\r\nblushed deeply, for she felt herself obliged to speak on a matter\r\nwhich had never yet been subject of speech between her and her\r\nmother. "Mamma," she said, "I cannot agree with you there. I may have\r\nwhat the world calls rank; but nevertheless we have been poor, and I\r\nhave not been brought up with costly habits. Why should I not live\r\nwith my husband as--as--as poorly as I have lived with my mother? You\r\nare not rich, dear mamma, and why should I be?"\r\n\r\nLady Desmond did not answer her daughter at once; but she was not\r\nsilent because an answer failed her. Her answer would have been ready\r\nenough had she dared to speak it out. "Yes, it is true; we have been\r\npoor. I, your mother, did by my imprudence bring down upon my head\r\nand on yours absolute, unrelenting, pitiless poverty. And because I\r\ndid so, I have never known one happy hour. I have spent my days in\r\nbitter remorse--in regretting the want of those things which it has\r\nbeen the more terrible to want as they are the customary attributes\r\nof people of my rank. I have been driven to hate those around me\r\nwho have been rich, because I have been poor. I have been utterly\r\nfriendless because I have been poor. I have been able to do none of\r\nthose sweet, soft, lovely things, by doing which other women win\r\nthe smiles of the world, because I have been poor. Poverty and rank\r\ntogether have made me wretched--have left me without employment,\r\nwithout society, and without love. And now would you tell me that\r\nbecause I have been poor you would choose to be poor also?" It would\r\nhave been thus that she would have answered, had she been accustomed\r\nto speak out her thoughts. But she had ever been accustomed to\r\nconceal them.\r\n\r\n"I was thinking quite as much of him as of you," at last she said.\r\n"Such an engagement to you would be fraught with much misery, but to\r\nhim it would be ruinous."\r\n\r\n"I do not think it, mamma."\r\n\r\n"But it is not necessary, Clara, that you should do anything. You\r\nwill wait, of course, and see what Herbert may say himself."\r\n\r\n"Herbert--"\r\n\r\n"Wait half a moment, my love. I shall be very much surprised if we\r\ndo not find that Mr. Fitzgerald himself will tell you that the match\r\nmust be abandoned."\r\n\r\n"But that will make no difference, mamma."\r\n\r\n"No difference, my dear! You cannot marry him against his will. You\r\ndo not mean to say that you would wish to bind him to his engagement,\r\nif he himself thought it would be to his disadvantage?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I will bind him to it."\r\n\r\n"Clara!"\r\n\r\n"I will make him know that it is not for his disadvantage. I will\r\nmake him understand that a friend and companion who loves him as\r\nI love him--as no one else will ever love him now--for I love him\r\nbecause he was so high-fortuned when he came to me, and because he\r\nis now so low-fortuned--that such a wife as I will be, cannot be a\r\nburden to him. I will cling to him whether he throws me off or no. A\r\nword from him might have broken our engagement before, but a thousand\r\nwords cannot do it now."\r\n\r\nLady Desmond stared at her daughter, for Clara, in her excitement,\r\nwas walking up and down the room. The countess had certainly not\r\nexpected all this, and she was beginning to think that the subject\r\nfor the present might as well be left alone. But Clara had not done\r\nas yet.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," she said, "I will not do anything without telling you; but\r\nI cannot leave Herbert in all his misery to think that I have no\r\nsympathy with him. I shall write to him."\r\n\r\n"Not before he writes to you, Clara! You would not wish to be\r\nindelicate?"\r\n\r\n"I know but little about delicacy--what people call delicacy; but I\r\nwill not be ungenerous or unkind. Mamma, you brought us two together.\r\nWas it not so? Did you not do so, fearing that I might--might still\r\ncare for Herbert\'s cousin? You did it; and half wishing to obey you,\r\nhalf attracted by all his goodness, I did learn to love Herbert\r\nFitzgerald; and I did learn to forget--no; but I learned to cease to\r\nlove his cousin. You did this and rejoiced at it; and now what you\r\ndid must remain done."\r\n\r\n"But, dearest Clara, it will not be for his good."\r\n\r\n"It shall be for his good. Mamma, I would not desert him now for all\r\nthat the world could give me. Neither for mother nor brother could I\r\ndo that. Without your leave I would not have given him the right to\r\nregard me as his own; but now I cannot take that right back again,\r\neven at your wish. I must write to him at once, mamma, and tell him\r\nthis."\r\n\r\n"Clara, at any rate you must not do that; that at least I must\r\nforbid."\r\n\r\n"Mother, you cannot forbid it now," the daughter said, after walking\r\ntwice the length of the room in silence. "If I be not allowed to send\r\na letter, I shall leave the house and go to him."\r\n\r\nThis was all very dreadful. Lady Desmond was astounded at the manner\r\nin which her daughter carried herself, and the voice with which she\r\nspoke. The form of her face was altered, and the very step with which\r\nshe trod was unlike her usual gait. What would Lady Desmond do? She\r\nwas not prepared to confine her daughter as a prisoner, nor could she\r\npublicly forbid the people about the place to go upon her message.\r\n\r\n"I did not expect that you would have been so undutiful," she said.\r\n\r\n"I hope I am not so," Clara answered. "But now my first duty is to\r\nhim. Did you not sanction our loving each other? People cannot call\r\nback their hearts and their pledges."\r\n\r\n"You will at any rate wait till to-morrow, Clara."\r\n\r\n"It is dark now," said Clara, despondingly, looking out through the\r\nwindow upon the falling night; "I suppose I cannot send to-night."\r\n\r\n"And you will show me what you write, dearest?"\r\n\r\n"No, mamma. If I wrote it for your eyes it could not be the same as\r\nif I wrote it only for his."\r\n\r\nVery gloomy, sombre, and silent, was the Countess of Desmond all that\r\nnight. Nothing further was said about the Fitzgeralds between her\r\nand her daughter, before they went to bed; and then Lady Desmond did\r\nspeak a few futile words.\r\n\r\n"Clara," she said. "You had better think over what we have been\r\nsaying, in bed to-night. You will be more collected to-morrow\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"I shall think of it of course," said Clara; "but thinking can make\r\nno difference," and then just touching her mother\'s forehead with her\r\nlips she went off slowly to her room.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of a letter she wrote when she got there, we have already\r\nseen; and have seen also that she took effective steps to have her\r\nletter carried to Castle Richmond at an hour sufficiently early in\r\nthe morning. There was no danger that the countess would stop the\r\nmessage, for the letter had been read twenty times by Emmeline and\r\nMary, and had been carried by Herbert to his mother\'s room, before\r\nLady Desmond had left her bed. "Do not set your heart on it too\r\nwarmly," said Herbert\'s mother to him.\r\n\r\n"But is she not excellent?" said Herbert. "It is because she speaks\r\nof you in such a way--"\r\n\r\n"You would not wish to bring her into misery, because of her\r\nexcellence."\r\n\r\n"But, mother, I am still a man," said Herbert. This was too much for\r\nthe suffering woman, the one fault of whose life had brought her son\r\nto such a pass, and throwing her arm round his neck she wept upon his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThere were other messengers went and came that day between Desmond\r\nCourt and Castle Richmond. Clara and her mother saw nothing of each\r\nother early in the morning; they did not breakfast together, nor was\r\nthere a word said between them on the subject of the Fitzgeralds.\r\nBut Lady Desmond early in the morning--early for her that is--sent\r\nher note also to Castle Richmond. It was addressed to Aunt Letty,\r\nMiss Letitia Fitzgerald, and went to say that Lady Desmond was very\r\nanxious to see Miss Letty. Under the present circumstances of the\r\nfamily, as described to Lady Desmond by Mr. Herbert Fitzgerald, she\r\nfelt that she could not ask to see "his mother;"--it was thus that\r\nshe overcame the difficulty which presented itself to her as to the\r\nproper title now to be given to Lady Fitzgerald;--but perhaps Miss\r\nLetty would be good enough to see her, if she called at such and such\r\nan hour. Aunt Letty, much perplexed, had nothing for it, but to say\r\nthat she would see her. The countess must now be looked on as closely\r\nconnected with the family--at any rate until that match were broken\r\noff; and therefore Aunt Letty had no alternative. And so, precisely\r\nat the hour named, the countess and Aunt Letty were seated together\r\nin the little breakfast-room of which mention has before been made.\r\n\r\nNo two women were ever closeted together who were more unlike each\r\nother,--except that they had one common strong love for family rank.\r\nBut in Aunt Letty it must be acknowledged that this passion was not\r\nunwholesome or malevolent in its course of action. She delighted in\r\nbeing a Fitzgerald, and in knowing that her branch of the Fitzgeralds\r\nhad been considerable people ever since her Norman ancestor had come\r\nover to Ireland with Strongbow. But then she had a useful idea that\r\nconsiderable people should do a considerable deal of good. Her family\r\npride operated more inwardly than outwardly,--inwardly as regarded\r\nher own family, and not outwardly as regarded the world. Her brother,\r\nand her nephew, and her sister-in-law, and nieces, were, she thought,\r\namong the highest commoners in Ireland; they were gentlefolks of the\r\nfirst water, and walked openly before the world accordingly, proving\r\ntheir claim to gentle blood by gentle deeds and honest conduct.\r\nPerhaps she did think too much of the Fitzgeralds of Castle Richmond;\r\nbut the sin was one of which no recording angel could have made much\r\nin his entry. That she was a stupid old woman, prejudiced in the\r\nhighest degree, and horribly ignorant of all the world beyond her own\r\nvery narrow circle,--even of that, I do not think that the recording\r\nangel could, under the circumstances, have made a great deal.\r\n\r\nAnd now how was her family pride affected by this horrible\r\ncatastrophe that had been made known to her? Herbert the heir, whom\r\nas heir she had almost idolized, was nobody. Her sister-in-law, whom\r\nshe had learned to love with the whole of her big heart, was no\r\nsister-in-law. Her brother was one, who, in lieu of adding glory to\r\nthe family, would always be regarded as the most unfortunate of the\r\nFitzgerald baronets. But with her, human nature was stronger than\r\nfamily pride, and she loved them all, not better, but more tenderly\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies were closeted together for about two hours; and then,\r\nwhen the door was opened, Aunt Letty might have been seen with her\r\nbonnet much on one side, and her poor old eyes and cheeks red with\r\nweeping. The countess, too, held her handkerchief to her eyes as she\r\ngot back into her pony carriage. She saw no one else there but Aunt\r\nLetty; and from her mood when she returned to Desmond Court it might\r\nbe surmised that from Aunt Letty she had learned little to comfort\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"They will be beggars!" she said to herself--"beggars!"--when the\r\ndoor of her own room had closed upon her. And there are few people in\r\nthe world who held such beggary in less esteem than did the Countess\r\nof Desmond. It may almost be said that she hated herself on account\r\nof her own poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nILL NEWS FLIES FAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nA dull, cold, wretched week passed over their heads at Castle\r\nRichmond, during which they did nothing but realize the truth\r\nof their position; and then came a letter from Mr. Prendergast,\r\naddressed to Herbert, in which he stated that such inquiries as\r\nhe had hitherto made left no doubt on his mind that the man named\r\nMollett, who had lately made repeated visits at Castle Richmond, was\r\nhe who had formerly taken the house in Dorsetshire under the name of\r\nTalbot. In his packet Mr. Prendergast sent copies of documents and of\r\nverbal evidence which he had managed to obtain; but with the actual\r\ndetails of these it is not necessary that I should trouble those who\r\nare following me in this story. In this letter Mr. Prendergast also\r\nrecommended that some intercourse should be had with Owen Fitzgerald.\r\nIt was expedient, he said, that all the parties concerned should\r\nrecognise Owen\'s position as the heir presumptive to the title and\r\nestate; and as he, he said, had found Mr. Fitzgerald of Hap House\r\nto be forbearing, generous, and high-spirited, he thought that this\r\nintercourse might be conducted without enmity or ill blood. And then\r\nhe suggested that Mr. Somers should see Owen Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nAll this Herbert explained to his father gently and without\r\ncomplaint; but it seemed now as though Sir Thomas had ceased to\r\ninterest himself in the matter. Such battle as it had been in his\r\npower to make he had made to save his son\'s heritage and his wife\'s\r\nname and happiness, even at the expense of his own conscience. That\r\nbattle had gone altogether against him, and now there was nothing\r\nleft for him but to turn his face to the wall and die. Absolute\r\nruin, through his fault, had come upon him and all that belonged to\r\nhim,--ruin that would now be known to the world at large; and it was\r\nbeyond his power to face that world again. In that the glory was gone\r\nfrom the house of his son, and of his son\'s mother, the glory was\r\ngone from his own house. He made no attempt to leave his bed, though\r\nstrongly recommended so to do by his own family doctor. And then a\r\nphysician came down from Dublin, who could only feel, whatever he\r\nmight say, how impossible it is to administer to a mind diseased. The\r\nmind of that poor man was diseased past all curing in this world, and\r\nthere was nothing left for him but to die.\r\n\r\nHerbert, of course, answered Clara\'s letter, but he did not go\r\nover to see her during that week, nor indeed for some little time\r\nafterwards. He answered it at considerable length, professing\r\nhis ready willingness to give back to Clara her troth, and even\r\nrecommending her, with very strong logic and unanswerable arguments\r\nof worldly sense, to regard their union as unwise and even\r\nimpossible; but nevertheless there protruded through all his sense\r\nand all his rhetoric, evidences of love and of a desire for love\r\nreturned, which were much more unanswerable than his arguments, and\r\nmuch stronger than his logic. Clara read his letter, not as he would\r\nhave advised her to read it, but certainly in the manner which best\r\npleased his heart, and answered it again, declaring that all that he\r\nsaid was no avail. He might be false to her if he would. If through\r\nfickleness of heart and purpose he chose to abandon her, she would\r\nnever complain--never at least aloud. But she would not be false to\r\nhim; nor were her inclinations such as to make it likely that she\r\nshould be fickle, even though her affection might be tried by a delay\r\nof years. Love with her had been too serious to be thrown aside. All\r\nwhich was rather strong language on the part of a young lady, but was\r\nthought by those other young ladies at Castle Richmond to show the\r\nvery essence of becoming young-ladyhood. They pronounced Clara to be\r\nperfect in feeling and in judgment, and Herbert could not find it in\r\nhis heart to contradict them.\r\n\r\nAnd of all these doings, writings, and resolves, Clara dutifully told\r\nher mother. Poor Lady Desmond was at her wits\' end in the matter.\r\nShe could scold her daughter, but she had no other power of doing\r\nanything. Clara had so taken the bit between her teeth that it was\r\nno longer possible to check her with any usual rein. In these days\r\nyoung ladies are seldom deprived by force of paper, pen, and ink; and\r\nthe absolute incarceration of such an offender would be still more\r\nunusual. Another countess would have taken her daughter away, either\r\nto London and a series of balls, or to the South of Italy, or to the\r\nfamily castle in the North of Scotland; but poor Lady Desmond had not\r\nthe power of other countesses. Now that it was put to the trial, she\r\nfound that she had no power, even over her own daughter. "Mamma, it\r\nwas your own doing," Clara would say; and the countess would feel\r\nthat this alluded not only to her daughter\'s engagement with Herbert\r\nthe disinherited, but also to her non-engagement with Owen the heir.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Lady Desmond sent for her son. The earl was\r\nstill at Eton, but was now grown to be almost a man--such a man as\r\nforward Eton boys are at sixteen--tall, and lathy, and handsome, with\r\nsoft incipient whiskers, a bold brow and blushing cheeks, with all a\r\nboy\'s love for frolic still strong within him, but some touch of a\r\nman\'s pride to check it. In her difficulty Lady Desmond sent for the\r\nyoung earl, who had now not been home since the previous midsummer,\r\nhoping that his young manhood might have some effect in saving his\r\nsister from the disgrace of a marriage which would make her so\r\ntotally bankrupt both in wealth and rank.\r\n\r\nMr. Somers did go once to Hap House, at Herbert\'s instigation; but\r\nvery little came of his visit. He had always disliked Owen, regarding\r\nhim as an unthrift, any close connexion with whom could only bring\r\ncontamination on the Fitzgerald property; and Owen had returned the\r\nfeeling tenfold. His pride had been wounded by what he had considered\r\nto be the agent\'s insolence, and he had stigmatised Mr. Somers to his\r\nfriends as a self-seeking, mercenary prig. Very little, therefore,\r\ncame of the visit. Mr. Somers, to give him his due, had attempted to\r\ndo his best; being anxious, for Herbert\'s sake, to conciliate Owen;\r\nperhaps having--and why not?--some eye to the future agency. But Owen\r\nwas hard, and cold, and uncommunicative,--very unlike what he had\r\nbefore been to Mr. Prendergast. But then Mr. Prendergast had never\r\noffended his pride.\r\n\r\n"You may tell my cousin Herbert," he said, with some little special\r\nemphasis on the word cousin, "that I shall be glad to see him, as\r\nsoon as he feels himself able to meet me. It will be for the good of\r\nus both that we should have some conversation together. Will you tell\r\nhim, Mr. Somers, that I shall be happy to go to him, or to see him\r\nhere? Perhaps my going to Castle Richmond, during the present illness\r\nof Sir Thomas, may be inconvenient." And this was all that Mr. Somers\r\ncould get from him.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time the whole story became known to everybody round\r\nthe neighbourhood. And what would have been the good of keeping it\r\nsecret? There are some secrets,--kept as secrets because they cannot\r\nwell be discussed openly,--which may be allowed to leak out with so\r\nmuch advantage! The day must come, and that apparently at no distant\r\ntime, when all the world would know the fate of that Fitzgerald\r\nfamily; when Sir Owen must walk into the hall of Castle Richmond, the\r\nundoubted owner of the mansion and demesne. Why then keep it secret?\r\nHerbert openly declared his wish to Mr. Somers that there should be\r\nno secret in the matter. "There is no disgrace," he said, thinking\r\nof his mother; "nothing to be ashamed of, let the world say what it\r\nwill."\r\n\r\nDown in the servants\' hall the news came to them gradually, whispered\r\nabout from one to another. They hardly understood what it meant,\r\nor how it had come to pass; but they did know that their master\'s\r\nmarriage had been no marriage, and that their master\'s son was no\r\nheir. Mrs. Jones said not a word in the matter to any one. Indeed,\r\nsince that day on which she had been confronted with Mollett, she had\r\nnot associated with the servants at all, but had kept herself close\r\nto her mistress. She understood what it all meant perfectly; and the\r\ndepth of the tragedy had so cowed her spirit that she hardly dared\r\nto speak of it. Who told the servants,--or who does tell servants of\r\nsuch matters, it is impossible to say; but before Mr. Prendergast had\r\nbeen three days out of the house they all knew that the Mr. Owen of\r\nHap House was to be the future master of Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"An\' a sore day it\'ll be; a sore day, a sore day," said Richard,\r\nseated in an arm-chair by the fire, at the end of the servants\' hall,\r\nshaking his head despondingly.\r\n\r\n"Faix, an\' you may say that," said Corney, the footman. "That Misther\r\nOwen will go tatthering away to the divil, when the old place comes\r\ninto his hans. No fear he\'ll make it fly."\r\n\r\n"Sorrow seize the ould lawyer for coming down here at all at all,"\r\nsaid the cook.\r\n\r\n"I never knew no good come of thim dry ould bachelors," said Biddy\r\nthe housemaid; "specially the Englishers."\r\n\r\n"The two of yez are no better nor simpletons," said Richard,\r\nmagisterially. "\'Twarn\'t he that done it. The likes of him couldn\'t\r\ndo the likes o\' that."\r\n\r\n"And what was it as done it?" said Biddy.\r\n\r\n"Ax no questions, and may be you\'ll be tould no lies," replied\r\nRichard.\r\n\r\n"In course we all knows it\'s along of her ladyship\'s marriage which\r\nwarn\'t no marriage," said the cook. "May the heavens be her bed when\r\nthe Lord takes her! A betther lady nor a kinder-hearted niver stepped\r\nthe floor of a kitchen."\r\n\r\n"\'Deed an that\'s thrue for you, cook," said Biddy, with the corner of\r\nher apron up to her eyes. "But tell me, Richard, won\'t poor Mr.\r\nHerbert have nothing?"\r\n\r\n"Never you mind about Mr. Herbert," said Richard, who had seen Biddy\r\ngrow up from a slip of a girl, and therefore was competent to snub\r\nher at every word.\r\n\r\n"Ah, but I do mind," said the girl. "I minds more about him than ere\r\na one of \'em; and av\' that Lady Clara won\'t have em a cause of\r\nthis--"\r\n\r\n"Not a step she won\'t, thin," said Corney. "She\'ll go back to Mr.\r\nOwen. He was her fust love. You\'ll see else." And so the matter was\r\ndiscussed in the servants\' hall at the great house.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest surprise, the greatest curiosity, and the\r\ngreatest consternation, were felt at the parsonage. The rumour\r\nreached Mr. Townsend at one of the Relief Committees;--and Mrs.\r\nTownsend from the mouth of one of her servants, during his absence,\r\non the same day; and when Mr. Townsend returned to the parsonage,\r\nthey met each other with blank faces.\r\n\r\n"Oh, \xc6neas!" said she, before she could get his greatcoat from off\r\nhis shoulders, "have you heard the news?"\r\n\r\n"What news?--about Castle Richmond?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; about Castle Richmond." And then she knew that he had heard it.\r\n\r\nSome glimmering of Lady Fitzgerald\'s early history had been known to\r\nboth of them, as it had been known almost to all in the country; but\r\nin late years this history had been so much forgotten, that men had\r\nceased to talk of it, and this calamity therefore came with all the\r\nweight of a new misfortune.\r\n\r\n"And, \xc6neas, who told you of it?" she asked, as they sat together\r\nover the fire, in their dingy, dirty parlour.\r\n\r\n"Well, strange to say, I heard it first from Father Barney."\r\n\r\n"Oh, mercy! and is it all about the country in that way?"\r\n\r\n"Herbert, you know, has not been at any one of the Committees for\r\nthe last ten days, and Mr. Somers for the last week past has been\r\nas silent as death; so much so, that that horrid creature, Father\r\nColumb, would have made a regular set speech the other day at\r\nGortnaclough, if I hadn\'t put him down."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, dear!" said Mrs. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"And I was talking to Father Barney about this, to-day--about Mr.\r\nSomers, that is."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes!"\r\n\r\n"And then he said, \'I suppose you know what has happened at Castle\r\nRichmond?\'"\r\n\r\n"How on earth had he learned?" asked Mrs. Townsend, jealous that a\r\nRoman Catholic priest should have heard such completely Protestant\r\nnews before the Protestant parson and his wife.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they learn everything--from the servants I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Of course, the mean creatures!" said Mrs. Townsend, forgetting,\r\nprobably, her own little conversation with her own man of all work\r\nthat morning. "But go on, \xc6neas."\r\n\r\n"\'What has happened,\' said I, \'at Castle Richmond?\' \'Oh, you haven\'t\r\nheard,\' said he. And I was obliged to own that I had not, though I\r\nsaw that it gave him a kind of triumph. \'Why,\' said he, \'very bad\r\nnews has reached them indeed; the worst of news.\' And then he told me\r\nabout Lady Fitzgerald. To give him his due, I must say that he was\r\nvery sorry--very sorry. \'The poor young fellow!\' he said--\'The poor\r\nyoung fellow!\' And I saw that he turned away his face to hide a\r\ntear."\r\n\r\n"Crocodile tears!" said Mrs. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"No, they were not," said her reverend lord; "and Father Barney is\r\nnot so bad as I once thought him."\r\n\r\n"I hope you are not going over too, \xc6neas?" And his consort almost\r\ncried as such a horrid thought entered her head. In her ideas any\r\nfeeling short of absolute enmity to a servant of the Church of Rome\r\nwas an abandonment of some portion of the Protestant basis of the\r\nChurch of England. "The small end of the wedge," she would call\r\nit, when people around her would suggest that the heart of a Roman\r\nCatholic priest might possibly not be altogether black and devilish.\r\n\r\n"Well, I hope not, my dear," said Mr. Townsend, with a slight touch\r\nof sarcasm in his voice. "But, as I was saying, Father Barney told me\r\nthen that this Mr. Prendergast--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I had known of his being there from the day of his coming."\r\n\r\n"This Mr. Prendergast, it seems, knew the whole affair, from\r\nbeginning to end."\r\n\r\n"But how did he know it, \xc6neas?"\r\n\r\n"That I can\'t tell you. He was a friend of Sir Thomas before his\r\nmarriage; I know that. And he has told them that it is of no use\r\ntheir attempting to keep it secret. He was over at Hap House with\r\nOwen Fitzgerald before he went."\r\n\r\n"And has Owen Fitzgerald been told?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he has been told--told that he is to be the next heir; so\r\nFather Barney says."\r\n\r\nMrs. Townsend wished in her heart that the news could have reached\r\nher through a purer source; but all this, coming though it did from\r\nFather Barney, tallied too completely with what she herself had heard\r\nto leave on her mind any doubt of its truth. And then she began to\r\nthink of Lady Fitzgerald and her condition, of Herbert and of his,\r\nand of the condition of them all, till by degrees her mind passed\r\naway from Father Barney and all his iniquities.\r\n\r\n"It is very dreadful," she said, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Very dreadful, very dreadful. I hardly know how to think of it. And\r\nI fear that Sir Thomas will not live many months to give them even\r\nthe benefit of his life interest."\r\n\r\n"And when he dies all will be gone?"\r\n\r\n"Everything."\r\n\r\nAnd then tears stood in her eyes also, and in his also after a while.\r\nIt is very easy for a clergyman in his pulpit to preach eloquently\r\nupon the vileness of worldly wealth, and the futility of worldly\r\nstation; but where will you ever find one, who, when the time of\r\nproof shall come, will give proof that he himself feels what he\r\npreaches? Mr. Townsend was customarily loud and eager upon this\r\nsubject, and yet he was now shedding tears because his young friend\r\nHerbert was deprived of his inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nPALLIDA MORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Somers, returning from Hap House, gave Owen\'s message to Herbert\r\nFitzgerald, but at the same time told him that he did not think any\r\ngood would come of such a meeting.\r\n\r\n"I went over there," he said, "because I would not willingly omit\r\nanything that Mr. Prendergast had suggested; but I did not expect\r\nany good to come of it. You know what I have always thought of Owen\r\nFitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Prendergast said that he behaved so well."\r\n\r\n"He did not know Prendergast, and was cowed for the moment by what he\r\nhad heard. That was natural enough. You do as you like, however; only\r\ndo not have him over to Castle Richmond."\r\n\r\nOwen, however, did not trust solely to Mr. Somers, but on the\r\nfollowing day wrote to Herbert, suggesting that they had better meet,\r\nand begging that the place and time of meeting might be named. He\r\nhimself again suggested Hap House, and declared that he would be at\r\nhome on any day and at any hour that his "cousin" might name, "only,"\r\nas he added, "the sooner the better." Herbert wrote back by the same\r\nmessenger, saying that he would be with him early on the following\r\nmorning; and on the following morning he drove up to the door of Hap\r\nHouse, while Owen was still sitting with his coffee-pot and knife and\r\nfork before him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Donnellan, whom we saw there on the occasion of our first\r\nmorning visit, was now gone, and Owen Fitzgerald was all alone in his\r\nhome. The captain had been an accustomed guest, spending perhaps half\r\nhis time there during the hunting season; but since Mr. Prendergast\r\nhad been at Hap House, he had been made to understand that the master\r\nwould fain be alone. And since that day Owen had never hunted, nor\r\nbeen noticed in his old haunts, nor had been seen talking to his old\r\nfriends. He had remained at home, sitting over the fire thinking,\r\nwandering up and down his own avenue, or standing about the stable,\r\nidly, almost unconscious of the grooming of his horses. Once and once\r\nonly he had been mounted; and then as the dusk of evening was coming\r\non he had trotted over quickly to Desmond Court, as though he had\r\nin hand some purport of great moment; but if so he changed his mind\r\nwhen he came to the gate, for he walked on slowly for three or four\r\nhundred yards beyond it, and then turning his horse\'s head, slowly\r\nmade his way back past the gate, and then trotted quickly home to Hap\r\nHouse. In these moments of his life he must make or mar himself for\r\nlife; \'twas so that he felt it; and how should he make himself, or\r\nhow avoid the marring? That was the question which he now strove to\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert entered the room, he rose from his chair, and walked\r\nquickly up to his visitor, with extended hand, and a look of welcome\r\nin his face. His manner was very different from that with which he\r\nhad turned and parted from his cousin, not many days since in the\r\ndemesne at Castle Richmond. Then he had intended absolutely to defy\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald; but there was no spirit of defiance now, either\r\nin his hand, or face, or in the tone of his voice.\r\n\r\n"I am very glad you have come," said he. "I hope you understood that\r\nI would have gone to you, only that I thought it might be better for\r\nboth of us to be here."\r\n\r\nHerbert said something to the effect that he had been quite\r\nwilling to come over to Hap House. But he was not at the moment so\r\nself-possessed as the other, and hardly knew how to begin the subject\r\nwhich was to be discussed between them.\r\n\r\n"Of course you know that Mr. Prendergast was here?" said Owen.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"And Mr. Somers also? I tell you fairly, Herbert, that when Mr.\r\nSomers came, I was not willing to say much to him. What has to be\r\nsaid must be said between you and me, and not to any third party. I\r\ncould not open my heart, nor yet speak my thoughts to Mr. Somers."\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, Herbert again said that Owen need have no scruple\r\nin speaking to him. "It is all plain sailing; too plain, I fear,"\r\nsaid he. "There is no doubt whatever now as to the truth of what Mr.\r\nPrendergast has told you."\r\n\r\nAnd then having said so much, Herbert waited for Owen to speak. He,\r\nHerbert himself, had little or nothing to say. Castle Richmond with\r\nits title and acres was not to be his, but was to be the property of\r\nthis man with whom he was now sitting. When that was actually and\r\npositively understood between them, there was nothing further to\r\nbe said; nothing as far as Herbert knew. That other sorrow of his,\r\nthat other and deeper sorrow which affected his mother\'s name and\r\nstation,--as to that he did not find himself called on to speak to\r\nOwen Fitzgerald. Nor was it necessary that he should say anything as\r\nto his great consolation--the consolation which had reached him from\r\nClara Desmond.\r\n\r\n"And is it true, Herbert," asked Owen at last, "that my uncle is so\r\nvery ill?" In the time of their kindly intercourse, Owen had always\r\ncalled Sir Thomas his uncle, though latterly he had ceased to do so.\r\n\r\n"He is very ill; very ill indeed," said Herbert. This was a subject\r\nin which Owen had certainly a right to feel interested, seeing that\r\nhis own investiture would follow immediately on the death of Sir\r\nThomas; but Herbert almost felt that the question might as well have\r\nbeen spared. It had been asked, however, almost solely with the view\r\nof gaining some few moments.\r\n\r\n"Herbert," he said at last, standing up from his chair, as he made an\r\neffort to begin his speech, "I don\'t know how far you will believe\r\nme when I tell you that all this news has caused me great sorrow. I\r\ngrieve for your father and your mother, and for you, from the very\r\nbottom of my heart."\r\n\r\n"It is very kind of you," said Herbert. "But the blow has fallen, and\r\nas for myself, I believe that I can bear it. I do not care so very\r\nmuch about the property."\r\n\r\n"Nor do I;" and now Owen spoke rather louder, and with his own look\r\nof strong impulse about his mouth and forehead. "Nor do I care so\r\nmuch about the property. You were welcome to it; and are so still. I\r\nhave never coveted it from you, and do not covet it."\r\n\r\n"It will be yours now without coveting," replied Herbert; and then\r\nthere was another pause, during which Herbert sat still, while Owen\r\nstood leaning with his back against the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n"Herbert," said he, after they had thus remained silent for two or\r\nthree minutes, "I have made up my mind on this matter, and I will\r\ntell you truly what I do desire, and what I do not. I do not desire\r\nyour inheritance, but I do desire that Clara Desmond shall be my\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"Owen," said the other, also getting up, "I did not expect when I\r\ncame here that you would have spoken to me about this."\r\n\r\n"It was that we might speak about this that I asked you to come here.\r\nBut listen to me. When I say that I want Clara Desmond to be my wife,\r\nI mean to say that I want that, and that only. It may be true that I\r\nam, or shall be, legally the heir to your father\'s estate. Herbert,\r\nI will relinquish all that, because I do not feel it to be my own. I\r\nwill relinquish it in any way that may separate myself from it most\r\nthoroughly. But in return, do you separate yourself from her who was\r\nmy own before you had ever known her."\r\n\r\nAnd thus he did make the proposition as to which he had been making\r\nup his mind since the morning on which Mr. Prendergast had come to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHerbert for a while was struck dumb with amazement, not so much at\r\nthe quixotic generosity of the proposal, as at the singular mind of\r\nthe man in thinking that such a plan could be carried out. Herbert\'s\r\nbest quality was no doubt his sturdy common sense, and that was\r\nshocked by a suggestion which presumed that all the legalities and\r\nordinary bonds of life could be upset by such an agreement between\r\ntwo young men. He knew that Owen Fitzgerald could not give away his\r\ntitle to an estate of fourteen thousand a year in this off-hand way,\r\nand that no one could accept such a gift were it possible to be\r\ngiven. The estate and title must belong to Owen, and could not\r\npossibly belong to any one else, merely at his word and fancy. And\r\nthen again, how could the love of a girl like Clara Desmond be\r\nbandied to and fro at the will of any suitor or suitors? That she had\r\nonce accepted Owen\'s love, Herbert knew; but since that, in a soberer\r\nmood, and with maturer judgment, she had accepted his. How could he\r\ngive it up to another, or how could that other take possession of it\r\nif so abandoned? The bargain was one quite impossible to be carried\r\nout; and yet Owen in proposing it had fully intended to be as good as\r\nhis word.\r\n\r\n"That is impossible," said Herbert in a low voice.\r\n\r\n"Why impossible? May I not do what I like with that which is my own?\r\nIt is not impossible. I will have nothing to do with that property of\r\nyours. In fact, it is not my own, and I will not take it; I will not\r\nrob you of that which you have been born to expect. But in return for\r\nthis--"\r\n\r\n"Owen, do not talk of it; would you abandon a girl whom you loved for\r\nany wealth, or any property?"\r\n\r\n"You cannot love her as I love her. I will talk to you on this matter\r\nopenly, as I have never yet talked to any one. Since first I saw\r\nClara Desmond, the only wish of my life has been that I might have\r\nher for my wife. I have longed for her as a child longs--if you know\r\nwhat I mean by that. When I saw that she was old enough to understand\r\nwhat love meant, I told her what was in my heart, and she accepted my\r\nlove. She swore to me that she would be mine, let mother or brother\r\nsay what they would. As sure as you are standing there a living man\r\nshe loved me with all truth. And that I loved her--! Herbert, I have\r\nnever loved aught but her; nothing else!--neither man nor woman, nor\r\nwealth nor title. All I ask is that I may have that which was my\r\nown."\r\n\r\n"But, Owen--" and Herbert touched his cousin\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Well; why do you not speak? I have spoken plainly enough."\r\n\r\n"It is not easy to speak plainly on all subjects. I would not, if I\r\ncould avoid it, say a word that would hurt your feelings."\r\n\r\n"Never mind my feelings. Speak out, and let us have the truth, in\r\nGod\'s name. My feelings have never been much considered yet--either\r\nin this matter or in any other."\r\n\r\n"It seems to me," said Herbert, "that the giving of Lady Clara\'s hand\r\ncannot depend on your will, or on mine."\r\n\r\n"You mean her mother."\r\n\r\n"No, by no means. Her mother now would be the last to favour me. I\r\nmean herself. If she loves me, as I hope and believe--nay, am sure--"\r\n\r\n"She did love me!" shouted Owen.\r\n\r\n"But even if so--. I do not now say anything of that; but even if\r\nso, surely you would not have her marry you if she does not love you\r\nstill? You would not wish her to be your wife if her heart belongs to\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"It has been given you at her mother\'s bidding."\r\n\r\n"However given it is now my own and it cannot be returned. Look here,\r\nOwen. I will show you her last two letters, if you will allow me; not\r\nin pride, I hope, but that you may truly know what are her wishes."\r\nAnd he took from his breast, where they had been ever since he\r\nreceived them, the two letters which Clara had written to him. Owen\r\nread them both twice over before he spoke, first one and then the\r\nother, and an indescribable look of pain fell on his brow as he did\r\nso. They were so tenderly worded, so sweet, so generous! He would\r\nhave given all the world to have had those letters addressed by her\r\nto himself. But even they did not convince him. His heart had never\r\nchanged, and he could not believe that there had been any change in\r\nhers.\r\n\r\n"I might have known," he said, as he gave them back, "that she would\r\nbe too noble to abandon you in your distress. As long as you were\r\nrich I might have had some chance of getting her back, despite the\r\nmachinations of her mother. But now that she thinks you are poor--."\r\nAnd then he stopped, and hid his face between his hands.\r\n\r\nAnd in what he had last said there was undoubtedly something of\r\ntruth. Clara\'s love for Herbert had never been passionate, till\r\npassion had been created by his misfortune. And in her thoughts\r\nof Owen there had been much of regret. Though she had resolved to\r\nwithdraw her love, she had not wholly ceased to love him. Judgment\r\nhad bade her to break her word to him, and she had obeyed her\r\njudgment. She had admitted to herself that her mother was right in\r\ntelling her that she could not join her own bankrupt fortunes to the\r\nfortunes of one who was both poor and a spendthrift; and thus she\r\nhad plucked from her heart the picture of the man she had loved,--or\r\nendeavoured so to pluck it. Some love for him, however, had\r\nunwittingly lingered there. And then Herbert had come with his suit,\r\na suitor fitted for her in every way. She had not loved him as she\r\nhad loved Owen. She had never felt that she could worship him, and\r\ntremble at the tones of his voice, and watch the glance of his\r\neye, and gaze into his face as though he were half divine. But she\r\nacknowledged his worth, and valued him: she knew that it behoved her\r\nto choose some suitor as her husband; and now that her dream was\r\ngone, where could she choose better than here? And thus Herbert had\r\nbeen accepted. He had been accepted, but the dream was not wholly\r\ngone. Owen was in adversity, ill spoken of by those around her,\r\nshunned by his own relatives, living darkly, away from all that is\r\nsoft in life; and for these reasons Clara could not wholly forget her\r\ndream. She had, in some sort, unconsciously clung to her old love,\r\ntill he to whom she had plighted her new troth was in adversity,--and\r\nthen all was changed. Then her love for Herbert did become a passion;\r\nand then, as Owen had become rich, she felt that she could think of\r\nhim without remorse. He was quite right in perceiving that his chance\r\nwas gone now that Herbert had ceased to be rich.\r\n\r\n"Owen," said Herbert, and his voice was full of tenderness, for at\r\nthis moment he felt that he did love and pity his cousin, "we must\r\neach of us bear the weight which fortune has thrown on us. It may\r\nbe that we are neither of us to be envied. I have lost all that men\r\ngenerally value, and you--."\r\n\r\n"I have lost all on earth that is valuable to me. But no; it is not\r\nlost,--not lost as yet. As long as her name is Clara Desmond, she\r\nis as open for me to win as she is for you. And, Herbert, think of\r\nit before you make me your enemy. See what I offer you,--not as a\r\nbargain, mind you. I give up all my title to your father\'s property.\r\nI will sign any paper that your lawyers may bring to me, which may\r\nserve to give you back your inheritance. As for me, I would scorn to\r\ntake that which belongs in justice to another. I will not have your\r\nproperty. Come what may, I will not have it. I will give it up to\r\nyou, either as to my enemy or as to my friend."\r\n\r\n"I sincerely hope that we may be friends, but what you say is\r\nimpossible."\r\n\r\n"It is not impossible. I hereby pledge myself that I will not take\r\nan acre of your father\'s lands; but I pledge myself also that I will\r\nalways be your enemy if Clara Desmond becomes your wife: and I mean\r\nwhat I say. I have set my heart on one thing, and on one thing only,\r\nand if I am ruined in that I am ruined indeed."\r\n\r\nHerbert remained silent, for he had nothing further that he knew how\r\nto plead; he felt as other men would feel, that each of them must\r\nkeep that which Fate had given him. Fate had decreed that Owen should\r\nbe the heir to Castle Richmond, and the decree thus gone forth must\r\nstand valid; and Fate had also decreed that Owen should be rejected\r\nby Clara Desmond, which other decree, as Herbert thought, must be\r\nheld as valid also. But he had no further inclination to argue upon\r\nthe subject: his cousin was becoming hot and angry; and Herbert was\r\nbeginning to wish that he was on his way home, that he might be once\r\nmore at his father\'s bedside, or in his mother\'s room, comforting her\r\nand being comforted.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Owen, after a while in his deep-toned voice; "what do\r\nyou say to my offer?"\r\n\r\n"I have nothing further to say: we must each take our own course; as\r\nfor me, I have lost everything but one thing, and it is not likely\r\nthat I shall throw that away from me."\r\n\r\n"Nor, so help me Heaven in my need! will I let that thing be filched\r\nfrom me. I have offered you kindness and brotherly love, and wealth,\r\nand all that friendship could do for a man; give me my way in this,\r\nand I will be to you such a comrade and such a brother."\r\n\r\n"Should I be a man, Owen, were I to give up this?"\r\n\r\n"Be a man! Yes! It is pride on your part. You do not love her; you\r\nhave never loved her as I have loved; you have not sat apart long\r\nmonths and months thinking of her, as I have done. From the time she\r\nwas a child I marked her as my own. As God will help me when I die,\r\nshe is all that I have coveted in this world;--all! But her I have\r\ncoveted with such longings of the heart, that I cannot bring myself\r\nto live without her;--nor will I." And then again they both were\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n"It may be as well that we should part now," said Herbert at last.\r\n"I do not know that we can gain anything by further talking on this\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"Well, you know that best; but I have one further question to ask\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Owen?"\r\n\r\n"You still think of marrying Clara Desmond?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly; of course I think of it."\r\n\r\n"And when? I presume you are not so chicken-hearted as to be afraid\r\nof speaking out openly what you intend to do."\r\n\r\n"I cannot say when; I had hoped that it would have been very soon;\r\nbut all this will of course delay it. It may be years first."\r\n\r\nThese last were the only pleasant words that Owen had heard. If there\r\nwere to be a delay of years, might not his chance still be as good\r\nas Herbert\'s? But then this delay was to be the consequence of his\r\ncousin\'s ruined prospects--and the accomplishment of that ruin Owen\r\nhad pledged himself to prevent! Was he by his own deed to enable\r\nhis enemy to take that very step which he was so firmly resolved to\r\nprevent?\r\n\r\n"You will give me your promise," said he, "that you will not marry\r\nher for the next three years? Make me that promise, and I will make\r\nyou the same."\r\n\r\nHerbert felt that there could be no possibility of his now marrying\r\nwithin the time named, but nevertheless he would not bring himself\r\nto make such a promise as this. He would make no bargain about Clara\r\nDesmond, about his Clara, which could in any way admit a doubt as to\r\nhis own right. Had Owen asked him to promise that he would not marry\r\nher during the next week he would have given no such pledge. "No,"\r\nsaid he, "I cannot promise that."\r\n\r\n"She is now only seventeen."\r\n\r\n"It does not matter. I will make no such promise, because on such a\r\nsubject you have no right to ask for any. When she will consent to\r\nrun her risk of happiness in coming to me, then I shall marry her."\r\n\r\nOwen was now walking up and down the room with rapid steps. "You have\r\nnot the courage to fight me fairly," said he.\r\n\r\n"I do not wish to fight you at all."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but you must fight me! Shall I see the prey taken out of my\r\njaws, and not struggle for it? No, by heavens! you must fight me; and\r\nI tell you fairly, that the fight shall be as hard as I can make it.\r\nI have offered you that which one living man is seldom able to offer\r\nto another,--money, and land, and wealth, and station; all these\r\nthings I throw away from me, because I feel that they should be\r\nyours; and I ask only in return the love of a young girl. I ask that\r\nbecause I feel that it should be mine. If it has gone from me--which\r\nI do not believe--it has been filched and stolen by a thief in the\r\nnight. She did love me, if a girl ever loved a man; but she was\r\nseparated from me, and I bore that patiently because I trusted her.\r\nBut she was young and weak, and her mother was strong and crafty. She\r\nhas accepted you at her mother\'s instance; and were I base enough to\r\nkeep from you your father\'s inheritance, her mother would no more\r\ngive her to you now than she would to me then. This is true; and\r\nif you know it to be true--as you do know, you will be mean, and\r\ndastard, and a coward--you will be no Fitzgerald if you keep from me\r\nthat which I have a right to claim as my own. Not fight! Ay, but you\r\nmust fight. We cannot both live here in this country if Clara Desmond\r\nbecome your wife. Mark my words, if that take place, you and I cannot\r\nlive here alongside of each other\'s houses." He paused for a moment\r\nafter this, and then added, "You can go now if you will, for I have\r\nsaid out my say."\r\n\r\nAnd Herbert did go,--almost without uttering a word of adieu. What\r\ncould he say in answer to such threats as these? That his cousin was\r\nin every way unreasonable,--as unreasonable in his generosity as he\r\nwas in his claims, he felt convinced. But an unreasonable man, though\r\nhe is one whom one would fain conquer by arguments were it possible,\r\nis the very man on whom arguments have no avail. A madman is mad\r\nbecause he is mad. Herbert had a great deal that was very sensible to\r\nallege in favour of his views, but what use of alleging anything of\r\nsense to such a mind as that of Owen Fitzgerald? So he went his way\r\nwithout further speech.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, Owen for a time went on walking his room, and then\r\nsank again into his chair. Abominably irrational as his method of\r\narranging all these family difficulties will no doubt seem to all\r\nwho may read of it, to him it had appeared not only an easy but a\r\nhappy mode of bringing back contentment to everybody. He was quite\r\nserious in his intention of giving up his position as heir to Castle\r\nRichmond. Mr. Prendergast had explained to him that the property was\r\nentailed as far as him, but no farther; and had done this, doubtless,\r\nwith the view, not then expressed, to some friendly arrangement by\r\nwhich a small portion of the property might be saved and restored\r\nto the children of Sir Thomas. But Owen had looked at it quite in\r\nanother light. He had, in justice, no right to inquire into all\r\nthose circumstances of his old cousin\'s marriage. Such a union was\r\na marriage in the eye of God, and should be held as such by him. He\r\nwould take no advantage of so terrible an accident.\r\n\r\nHe would take no advantage. So he said to himself over and over\r\nagain; but yet, as he said it, he resolved that he would take\r\nadvantage. He would not touch the estate; but surely if he abstained\r\nfrom touching it, Herbert would be generous enough to leave to him\r\nthe solace of his love! And he had no scruple in allotting to Clara\r\nthe poorer husband instead of the richer. He was no poorer now than\r\nwhen she had accepted him. Looking at it in that light, had he not a\r\nright to claim that she should abide by her first acceptance? Could\r\nany one be found to justify the theory that a girl may throw over a\r\npoor lover because a rich lover comes in the way? Owen had his own\r\nideas of right and wrong--ideas which were not without a basis of\r\nstrong, rugged justice; and nothing could be more antagonistic to\r\nthem than such a doctrine as this. And then he still believed in his\r\nheart that he was dearer to Clara than that other richer suitor. He\r\nheard of her from time to time, and those who had spoken to him had\r\nspoken of her as pining for love of him. In this there had been much\r\nof the flattery of servants, and something of the subservience of\r\nthose about him who wished to stand well in his graces. But he had\r\nbelieved it. He was not a conceited man, nor even a vain man. He did\r\nnot think himself more clever than his cousin; and as for personal\r\nappearance, it was a matter to which his thoughts never descended;\r\nbut he had about him a self-dependence and assurance in his own\r\nmanhood, which forbade him to doubt the love of one who had told him\r\nthat she loved him.\r\n\r\nAnd he did not believe in Herbert\'s love. His cousin was, as he\r\nthought, of a calibre too cold for love. That Clara was valued by\r\nhim, Owen did not doubt--valued for her beauty, for her rank, for her\r\ngrace and peerless manner; but what had such value as that to do with\r\nlove? Would Herbert sacrifice everything for Clara Desmond? would he\r\nbid Pelion fall on Ossa? would he drink up Esil? All this would Owen\r\ndo, and more; he would do more than any Laertes had ever dreamed.\r\nHe would give up for now and for ever all title to those rich lands\r\nwhich made the Fitzgeralds of Castle Richmond the men of greatest\r\nmark in all their county.\r\n\r\nAnd thus he fanned himself into a fury as he thought of his cousin\'s\r\nwant of generosity. Herbert would be the heir, and because he was the\r\nheir he would be the favoured lover. But there might yet be time and\r\nopportunity; and at any rate Clara should not marry without knowing\r\nwhat was the whole truth. Herbert was ungenerous, but Clara still\r\nmight be just. If not,--then, as he had said before, he would fight\r\nout the battle to the end as with an enemy.\r\n\r\nHerbert, when he got on to his horse to ride home, was forced to\r\nacknowledge to himself that no good whatever had come from his visit\r\nto Hap House. Words had been spoken which might have been much better\r\nleft unspoken. An angry man will often cling to his anger because\r\nhis anger has been spoken; he will do evil because he has threatened\r\nevil, and is ashamed to be better than his words. And there was\r\nno comfort to be derived from those lavish promises made by Owen\r\nwith regard to the property. To Herbert\'s mind they were mere\r\nmoonshine--very graceful on the part of the maker, but meaning\r\nnothing. No one could have Castle Richmond but him who owned it\r\nlegally. Owen Fitzgerald would become Sir Owen, and would, as a\r\nmatter of course, be Sir Owen of Castle Richmond. There was no\r\ncomfort on that score; and then, on that other score, there was so\r\nmuch discomfort. Of giving up his bride Herbert never for a moment\r\nthought; but he did think, with increasing annoyance, of the angry\r\nthreats which had been pronounced against him.\r\n\r\nWhen he rode into the stable-yard as was his wont, he found Richard\r\nwaiting for him. This was not customary; as in these latter days\r\nRichard, though he always drove the car, as a sort of subsidiary\r\ncoachman to the young ladies to whom the car was supposed to belong\r\nin fee, did not act as general groom. He had been promoted beyond\r\nthis, and was a sort of hanger-on about the house, half indoor\r\nservant and half out, doing very much what he liked, and giving\r\nadvice to everybody, from the cook downwards. He thanked God that\r\nhe knew his place, he would often say; but nobody else knew it.\r\nNevertheless everybody liked him; even the poor housemaid whom he\r\nsnubbed.\r\n\r\n"Is anything the matter?" asked Herbert, looking at the man\'s\r\nsorrow-laden face.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed an\' there is, Mr. Herbert; Sir Thomas is--"\r\n\r\n"My father is not dead!" exclaimed Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Mr. Herbert; it\'s not so bad as that; but he is very\r\nfailing,--very failing. My lady is with him now."\r\n\r\nHerbert ran into the house, and at the bottom of the chief stairs\r\nhe met one of his sisters who had heard the steps of his horse. "Oh,\r\nHerbert, I am so glad you have come!" said she. Her eyes and cheeks\r\nwere red with tears, and her hand, as her brother took it, was cold\r\nand numbed.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Mary? is he worse?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, so much worse. Mamma and Emmeline are there. He has asked for\r\nyou three or four times, and always says that he is dying. I had\r\nbetter go up and say that you are here."\r\n\r\n"And what does my mother think of it?"\r\n\r\n"She has never left him, and therefore I cannot tell; but I know from\r\nher face that she thinks that he is--dying. Shall I go up, Herbert?"\r\nand so she went, and Herbert, following softly on his toes, stood\r\nin the corridor outside the bedroom-door, waiting till his arrival\r\nshould have been announced. It was but a minute, and then his sister,\r\nreturning to the door, summoned him to enter.\r\n\r\nThe room had been nearly darkened, but as there were no curtains to\r\nthe bed, Herbert could see his mother\'s face as she knelt on a stool\r\nat the bedside. His father was turned away from him, and lay with his\r\nhand inside his wife\'s, and Emmeline was sitting on the foot of the\r\nbed, with her face between her hands, striving to stifle her sobs.\r\n"Here is Herbert now, dearest," said Lady Fitzgerald, with a low,\r\nsoft voice, almost a whisper, yet clear enough to cause no effort in\r\nthe hearing. "I knew that he would not be long." And Herbert, obeying\r\nthe signal of his mother\'s eye, passed round to the other side of the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n"Father," said he, "are you not so well to-day?"\r\n\r\n"My poor boy, my poor ruined boy!" said the dying man, hardly\r\narticulating the words as he dropped his wife\'s hand and took that\r\nof his son. Herbert found that it was wet, and clammy, and cold, and\r\nalmost powerless in its feeble grasp.\r\n\r\n"Dearest father, you are wrong if you let that trouble you; all that\r\nwill never trouble me. Is it not well that a man should earn his own\r\nbread? Is it not the lot of all good men?" But still the old man\r\nmurmured with his broken voice, "My poor boy, my poor boy!"\r\n\r\nThe hopes and aspirations of his eldest son are as the breath of his\r\nnostrils to an Englishman who has been born to land and fortune.\r\nWhat had not this poor man endured in order that his son might be\r\nSir Herbert Fitzgerald of Castle Richmond? But this was no longer\r\npossible; and from the moment that this had been brought home to him,\r\nthe father had felt that for him there was nothing left but to die.\r\n"My poor boy," he muttered, "tell me that you have forgiven me."\r\n\r\nAnd then they all knelt round the bed and prayed with him; and\r\nafterwards they tried to comfort him, telling him how good he had\r\nbeen to them; and his wife whispered in his ear that if there had\r\nbeen fault, the fault was hers, but that her conscience told her that\r\nsuch fault had been forgiven; and while she said this she motioned\r\nthe children away from him, and strove to make him understand that\r\nhuman misery could never kill the soul, and should never utterly\r\ndepress the spirit. "Dearest love," she said, still whispering to\r\nhim in her low, sweet voice--so dear to him, but utterly inaudible\r\nbeyond--"if you would cease to accuse yourself so bitterly, you might\r\nyet be better, and remain with us to comfort us."\r\n\r\nBut the slender, half-knit man, whose arms are without muscles and\r\nwhose back is without pith, will strive in vain to lift the weight\r\nwhich the brawny vigour of another tosses from the ground almost\r\nwithout an effort. It is with the mind and the spirit as with the\r\nbody; only this, that the muscles of the body can be measured, but\r\nnot so those of the spirit. Lady Fitzgerald was made of other stuff\r\nthan Sir Thomas; and that which to her had cost an effort, but with\r\nan effort had been done surely, was to him as impossible as the\r\nlabour of Hercules. "My poor boy, my poor ruined boy!" he still\r\nmuttered, as she strove to comfort him.\r\n\r\n"Mamma has sent for Mr. Townsend," Emmeline whispered to her brother,\r\nas they stood together in the bow of the window.\r\n\r\n"And do you really think he is so bad as that?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure that mamma does. I believe he had some sort of a fit\r\nbefore you came. At any rate, he did not speak for two hours."\r\n\r\n"And was not Finucane here?" Finucane was the Mallow doctor.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but he had left before papa became so much worse. Mamma has\r\nsent for him also."\r\n\r\nBut I do not know that it boots to dally longer in a dying chamber.\r\nIt is an axiom of old that the stage curtain should be drawn before\r\nthe inexorable one enters in upon his final work. Doctor Finucane did\r\ncome, but his coming was all in vain. Sir Thomas had known that it\r\nwas in vain, and so also had his patient wife. There was that mind\r\ndiseased, towards the cure of which no Doctor Finucane could make any\r\npossible approach. And Mr. Townsend came also, let us hope not in\r\nvain; though the cure which he fain would have perfected can hardly\r\nbe effected in such moments as those. Let us hope that it had been\r\nalready effected. The only crying sin which we can lay to the charge\r\nof the dying man is that of which we have spoken; he had endeavoured\r\nby pensioning falsehood and fraud to preserve for his wife her name,\r\nand for his son that son\'s inheritance. Even over this, deep as it\r\nwas, the recording angel may have dropped some cleansing tears of\r\npity.\r\n\r\nThat night the poor man died, and the Fitzgeralds who sat in the\r\nchambers of Castle Richmond were no longer the owners of the mansion.\r\nThere was no speech of Sir Herbert among the servants as there would\r\nhave been had these tidings not have reached them. Dr. Finucane had\r\nremained in the house, and even he, in speaking of the son, had shown\r\nthat he knew the story. They were strangers there now, as they all\r\nknew--intruders, as they would soon be considered in the house of\r\ntheir cousin Owen; or rather not their cousin. In that he was above\r\nthem by right of his blood, they had no right to claim him as their\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that at such a moment all this should not have been\r\nthought of; but those who say so know little, as I imagine, of the\r\ntrue effect of sorrow. No wife and no children ever grieved more\r\nheartily for a father; but their grief was blacker and more gloomy in\r\nthat they knew that they were outcasts in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd during that long night as Herbert and his sisters sat up cowering\r\nround the fire, he told them of all that had been said at Hap House.\r\n"And can it not be as he says?" Mary had asked.\r\n\r\n"And that Herbert should give up his wife!" said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n"No; but that other thing."\r\n\r\n"Do not dream of it," said Herbert. "It is all, all impossible. The\r\nhouse that we are now in belongs to Sir Owen Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MONTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now I will beg my readers to suppose a month to have passed by\r\nsince Sir Thomas Fitzgerald died. It was a busy month in Ireland.\r\nIt may probably be said that so large a sum of money had never been\r\ncirculated in the country in any one month since money had been known\r\nthere; and yet it may also be said that so frightful a mortality had\r\nnever occurred there from the want of that which money brings. It was\r\nwell understood by all men now that the customary food of the country\r\nhad disappeared. There was no longer any difference of opinion\r\nbetween rich and poor, between Protestant and Roman Catholic; as to\r\nthat, no man dared now to say that the poor, if left to themselves,\r\ncould feed themselves, or to allege that the sufferings of the\r\ncountry arose from the machinations of money-making speculators. The\r\nfamine was an established fact, and all men knew that it was God\'s\r\ndoing,--all men knew this, though few could recognize as yet with how\r\nmuch mercy God\'s hand was stretched out over the country.\r\n\r\nOr may it not perhaps be truer to say that in such matters there\r\nis no such thing as mercy--no special mercies--no other mercy than\r\nthat fatherly, forbearing, all-seeing, perfect goodness by which the\r\nCreator is ever adapting this world to the wants of His creatures,\r\nand rectifying the evils arising from their faults and follies? _Sed\r\nquo Musa tendis?_ Such discourses of the gods as these are not to be\r\nfitly handled in such small measures.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there was the famine, undoubted now by any one; and\r\ndeath, who in visiting Castle Richmond may be said to have knocked at\r\nthe towers of a king, was busy enough also among the cabins of the\r\npoor. And now the great fault of those who were the most affected was\r\nbecoming one which would not have been at first sight expected. One\r\nwould think that starving men would become violent, taking food by\r\nopen theft--feeling, and perhaps not without some truth, that the\r\nagony of their want robbed such robberies of its sin. But such was by\r\nno means the case. I only remember one instance in which the bakers\'\r\nshops were attacked; and in that instance the work was done by those\r\nwho were undergoing no real suffering. At Clonmel, in Tipperary,\r\nthe bread was one morning stripped away from the bakers\' shops; but\r\nat that time, and in that place, there was nothing approaching to\r\nfamine. The fault of the people was apathy. It was the feeling of the\r\nmultitude that the world and all that was good in it was passing away\r\nfrom them; that exertion was useless, and hope hopeless. "Ah, me!\r\nyour honour," said a man to me, "there\'ll never be a bit and a sup\r\nagain in the county Cork! The life of the world is fairly gone!"\r\n\r\nAnd it was very hard to repress this feeling. The energy of a man\r\ndepends so much on the outward circumstances that encumber him! It is\r\nso hard to work when work seems hopeless--so hard to trust where the\r\nbasis of our faith is so far removed from sight! When large tracts\r\nof land went out of cultivation, was it not natural to think that\r\nagriculture was receding from the country, leaving the green hills\r\nonce more to be brown and barren, as hills once green have become in\r\nother countries? And when men were falling in the highways, and women\r\nwould sit with their babes in their arms, listless till death should\r\ncome to them, was it not natural to think that death was making a\r\nhuge success--that he, the inexorable one, was now the inexorable\r\nindeed?\r\n\r\nThere were greatly trusting hearts that could withstand the weight of\r\nthis terrible pressure, and thinking minds which saw that good would\r\ncome out of this great evil; but such hearts and such minds were not\r\nto be looked for among the suffering poor; and were not, perhaps,\r\noften found even among those who were not poor or suffering. It was\r\nvery hard to be thus trusting and thoughtful while everything around\r\nwas full of awe and agony.\r\n\r\nThe people, however, were conscious of God\'s work, and were becoming\r\ndull and apathetic. They clustered about the roads, working lazily\r\nwhile their strength lasted them; and afterwards, when strength\r\nfailed them for this, they clustered more largely in the poor-houses.\r\nAnd in every town--in every assemblage of houses which in England\r\nwould be called a village, there was a poor-house. Any big barrack of\r\na tenement that could be obtained at a moment\'s notice, whatever the\r\nrent, became a poor-house in the course of twelve hours;--in twelve,\r\nnay, in two hours. What was necessary but the bare walls, and a\r\nsupply of yellow meal? Bad provision this for all a man\'s wants,--as\r\nwas said often enough by irrational philanthropists; but better\r\nprovision than no shelter and no yellow meal! It was bad that men\r\nshould be locked up at night without any of the appliances of\r\ndecency; bad that they should be herded together for day after day\r\nwith no resource but the eating twice a day of enough unsavoury\r\nfood to keep life and soul together;--very bad, ye philanthropical\r\nirrationalists! But is not a choice of evils all that is left to us\r\nin many a contingency? Was not even this better than that life and\r\nsoul should be allowed to part, without any effort at preserving\r\ntheir union?\r\n\r\nAnd thus life and soul were kept together, the government of the day\r\nhaving wisely seen what, at so short a notice, was possible for them\r\nto do, and what was absolutely impossible. It is in such emergencies\r\nas these that the watching and the wisdom of a government are\r\nnecessary; and I shall always think--as I did think then--that the\r\nwisdom of its action and the wisdom of its abstinence from action\r\nwere very good. And now again the fields in Ireland are green,\r\nand the markets are busy, and money is chucked to and fro like a\r\nweathercock which the players do not wish to have abiding with them;\r\nand the tardy speculator going over to look for a bit of land comes\r\nback muttering angrily that fancy prices are demanded. "They\'ll run\r\nyou up to thirty-three years\' purchase," says the tardy speculator,\r\nthinking, as it seems, that he is specially ill used. Agricultural\r\nwages have been nearly doubled in Ireland during the last fifteen\r\nyears. Think of that, Master Brook. Work for which, at six shillings\r\na week, there would be a hundred hungry claimants in 1845,--in the\r\ngood old days before the famine, when repeal was so immediately\r\nexpected--will now fetch ten shillings, the claimants being by no\r\nmeans numerous. In 1843 and 1844, I knew men to work for fourpence\r\na day--something over the dole on which we are told, being mostly\r\nincredulous as we hear it, that a Coolie labourer can feed himself\r\nwith rice in India;--not one man or two men, the broken down\r\nincapables of the parish, but the best labour of the country. One and\r\ntwopence is now about the cheapest rate at which a man can be hired\r\nfor agricultural purposes. While this is so, and while the prices\r\nare progressing, there is no cause for fear, let Bishops A and B,\r\nand Archbishops C and D fret and fume with never so great vexation\r\ntouching the clipped honours of their father the Pope.\r\n\r\nBut again; Quo Musa tendis? I could write on this subject for a week\r\nwere it not that Rhadamanthus awaits me, Rhadamanthus the critic; and\r\nRhadamanthus is, of all things, impatient of an episode.\r\n\r\nLife and soul were kept together in those terrible days;--that is,\r\nthe Irish life and soul generally. There were many slips, in which\r\nthe union was violently dissolved,--many cases in which the yellow\r\nmeal allowed was not sufficient, or in which it did not reach the\r\nsufferer in time to prevent such dissolution,--cases which when\r\nnumbered together amounted to thousands. And then the pestilence\r\ncame, taking its victims by tens of thousands,--but that was after\r\nthe time with which we shall have concern here; and immigration\r\nfollowed, taking those who were saved by hundreds of thousands.\r\nBut the millions are still there, a thriving people; for His mercy\r\nendureth for ever.\r\n\r\nDuring this month, the month ensuing upon the death of Sir Thomas\r\nFitzgerald, Herbert could of course pay no outward attention to the\r\nwants or relief of the people. He could make no offer of assistance,\r\nfor nothing belonged to him; nor could he aid in the councils of\r\nthe committees, for no one could have defined the position of the\r\nspeaker. And during that month nothing was defined about Castle\r\nRichmond. Lady Fitzgerald was still always called by her title. The\r\npeople of the country, including the tradesmen of the neighbouring\r\ntowns, addressed the owner of Hap House as Sir Owen; and gradually\r\nthe name was working itself into common use, though he had taken no\r\nsteps to make himself legally entitled to wear it. But no one spoke\r\nof Sir Herbert. The story was so generally known, that none were so\r\nignorant as to suppose him to be his father\'s heir. The servants\r\nabout the place still called him Mr. Herbert, orders to that effect\r\nhaving been specially given; and the peasants of the country, with\r\nthat tact which graces them, and with that anxiety to abstain from\r\ngiving pain which always accompanies them unless when angered,\r\ncarefully called him by no name. They knew that he was not Sir\r\nHerbert; but they would not believe but what, perchance, he might\r\nbe so yet on some future day. So they took off their old hats to\r\nhim, and passed him silently in his sorrow; or if they spoke to him,\r\naddressed his honour simply, omitting all mention of that Christian\r\nname, which the poor Irishman is generally so fond of using. "Mister\r\nBlake" sounds cold and unkindly in his ears. It is the "Masther,"\r\nor "His honour," or if possible "Misther Thady." Or if there be any\r\nhandle, that is used with avidity. Pat is a happy man when he can\r\naddress his landlord as "Sir Patrick."\r\n\r\nBut now the "ould masther\'s son" could be called by no name. Men knew\r\nnot what he was to be, though they knew well that he was not that\r\nwhich he ought to be. And there were some who attempted to worship\r\nOwen as the rising sun; but for such of them as had never worshipped\r\nhim before that game was rather hopeless. In those days he was not\r\nmuch seen, neither hunting nor entertaining company; but when seen he\r\nwas rough enough with those who made any deep attempt to ingratiate\r\nthemselves with his coming mightiness. And during this month he\r\nwent over to London, having been specially invited so to do by Mr.\r\nPrendergast; but very little came of his visit there, except that it\r\nwas certified to him that he was beyond all doubt the baronet. "And\r\nthere shall be no unnecessary delay, Sir Owen," said Mr. Prendergast,\r\n"in putting you into full possession of all your rights." In answer\r\nto which Owen had replied that he was not anxious to be put in\r\npossession of any rights. That as far as any active doing of his own\r\nwas concerned, the title might lie in abeyance, and that regarding\r\nthe property he would make known his wish to Mr. Prendergast very\r\nquickly after his return to Ireland. But he intimated at the same\r\ntime that there could be no ground for disturbing Lady Fitzgerald,\r\nas he had no intention under any circumstances of living at Castle\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n"Had you not better tell Lady Fitzgerald that yourself?" said Mr.\r\nPrendergast, catching at the idea that his friend\'s widow--my readers\r\nwill allow me so to call her--might be allowed to live undisturbed at\r\nthe family mansion, if not for life, at any rate for a few years. If\r\nthis young man were so generous, why should it not be so? He would\r\nnot want the big house, at any rate, till he were married.\r\n\r\n"It would be better that you should say so," said Owen. "I have\r\nparticular reasons for not wishing to go there."\r\n\r\n"But allow me to say, my dear young friend--and I hope I may call you\r\nso, for I greatly admire the way in which you have taken all these\r\ntidings--that I would venture to advise you to drop the remembrance\r\nof any unpleasantness that may have existed. You should now feel\r\nyourself to be the closest friend of that family."\r\n\r\n"So I would if--," and then Owen stopped short, though Mr.\r\nPrendergast gave him plenty of time to finish his sentence were he\r\nminded to do so.\r\n\r\n"In your present position," continued the lawyer, "your influence\r\nwill be very great."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t explain it all," said Owen; "but I don\'t think my influence\r\nwill be great at all. And what is more, I do not want any influence\r\nof that sort. I wish Lady Fitzgerald to understand that she is at\r\nperfect liberty to stay where she is,--as far as I am concerned. Not\r\nas a favour from me, mind; for I do not think that she would take a\r\nfavour from my hands."\r\n\r\n"But, my dear sir!"\r\n\r\n"Therefore you had better write to her about remaining there."\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast did write to her, or rather to Herbert: but in doing\r\nso he thought it right to say that the permission to live at Castle\r\nRichmond should be regarded as a kindness granted them by their\r\nrelative. "It is a kindness which, under the circumstances, your\r\nmother may, I think, accept without compunction; at any rate, for\r\nsome time to come,--till she shall have suited herself without\r\nhurrying her choice; but, nevertheless, it must be regarded as a\r\ngenerous offer on his part; and I do hope, my dear Herbert, that you\r\nand he will be fast friends."\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Prendergast did not in the least comprehend the workings of\r\nOwen\'s mind; and Herbert, who knew more of them than any one else,\r\ndid not understand them altogether. Owen had no idea of granting any\r\nfavour to his relatives, who, as he thought, had never granted any to\r\nhim. What Owen wanted,--or what he told himself that he wanted,--was\r\njustice. It was his duty as a just man to abstain from taking hold of\r\nthose acres, and he was prepared to do his duty. But it was equally\r\nHerbert\'s duty as a just man to abstain from taking hold of Clara\r\nDesmond, and he was resolved that he would never be Herbert\'s friend\r\nif Herbert did not perform that duty. And then, though he felt\r\nhimself bound to give up the acres,--though he did regard this as an\r\nimperative duty, he nevertheless felt also that something was due\r\nto him for his readiness to perform such a duty,--that some reward\r\nshould be conceded to him; what this reward was to be, or rather what\r\nhe wished it to be, we all know.\r\n\r\nHerbert had utterly refused to engage in any such negotiation; but\r\nOwen, nevertheless, would not cease to think that something might yet\r\nbe done. Who was so generous as Clara, and would not Clara herself\r\nspeak out if she knew how much her old lover was prepared to do for\r\nthis newer lover? Half a dozen times Owen made up his mind to explain\r\nthe whole thing to Mr. Prendergast; but when he found himself in the\r\npresence of the lawyer, he could not talk about love. Young men are\r\nso apt to think that their seniors in age cannot understand romance,\r\nor acknowledge the force of a passion. But here they are wrong, for\r\nthere would be as much romance after forty as before, I take it, were\r\nit not checked by the fear of ridicule. So Owen stayed a week in\r\nLondon, seeing Mr. Prendergast every day; and then he returned to Hap\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time life went on at a very sad pace at Desmond Court.\r\nThere was no concord whatever between the two ladies residing there.\r\nThe mother was silent, gloomy, and sometimes bitter, seldom saying a\r\nword about Herbert Fitzgerald or his prospects, but saying that word\r\nwith great fixity of purpose when it was spoken. "No one," she said,\r\n"should attribute to her the poverty and misery of her child. That\r\nmarriage should not take place from her house, or with her consent."\r\nAnd Clara for the most part was silent also. In answer to such words\r\nas the above she would say nothing; but when, as did happen once or\r\ntwice, she was forced to speak, she declared openly enough that no\r\nearthly consideration should induce her to give up her engagement.\r\n\r\nAnd then the young earl came home, brought away from his school in\r\norder that his authority might have effect on his sister. To speak\r\nthe truth, he was unwilling enough to interfere, and would have\r\ndeclined to come at all could he have dared to do so. Eton was now\r\nmore pleasant to him than Desmond Court, which, indeed, had but\r\nlittle of pleasantness to offer to a lad such as he was now. He\r\nwas sixteen, and manly for his age; but the question in dispute\r\nat Desmond Court offered little attraction even to a manly boy of\r\nsixteen. In that former question as to Owen he had said a word or\r\ntwo, knowing that Owen could not be looked upon as a fitting husband\r\nfor his sister; but now he knew not how to counsel her again as to\r\nHerbert, seeing that it was but the other day that he had written a\r\nlong letter, congratulating her on that connection.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month, however, he did arrive, making glad his\r\nmother\'s heart as she looked at his strong limbs and his handsome\r\nopen face. And Clara, too, threw herself so warmly into his arms that\r\nhe did feel glad that he had come to her. "Oh, Patrick, it is so\r\nsweet to have you here!" she said, before his mother had had time to\r\nspeak to him.\r\n\r\n"Dearest Clara!"\r\n\r\n"But, Patrick, you must not be cruel to me. Look here, Patrick; you\r\nare my only brother, and I so love you that I would not offend you\r\nor turn you against me for worlds. You are the head of our family,\r\ntoo, and nothing should be done that you do not like. But if so much\r\ndepends on you, you must think well before you decide on anything."\r\n\r\nHe opened his young eyes and looked intently into her face, for there\r\nwas an earnestness in her words that almost frightened him. "You must\r\nthink well of it all before you speak, Patrick; and remember this,\r\nyou and I must be honest and honourable, whether we be poor or no.\r\nYou remember about Owen Fitzgerald, how I gave way then because I\r\ncould do so without dishonour. But now--"\r\n\r\n"But, Clara, I do not understand it all as yet."\r\n\r\n"No; you cannot,--not as yet--and I will let mamma tell you the\r\nstory. All I ask is this, that you will think of my honour before you\r\nsay a word that can favour either her or me." And then he promised\r\nher that he would do so; and his mother, when on the following\r\nmorning she told him all the history, found him reserved and silent.\r\n\r\n"Look at his position," said the mother, pleading her cause before\r\nher son. "He is illegitimate, and--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but mother--"\r\n\r\n"I know all that, my dear; I know what you would say; and no one can\r\npity Mr. Fitzgerald\'s position more than I do; but you would not on\r\nthat account have your sister ruined. It is romance on her part."\r\n\r\n"But what does he say?"\r\n\r\n"He is quite willing to give up the match. He has told me so, and\r\nsaid as much to his aunt, whom I have seen three times on the\r\nsubject."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean that he wishes to give it up?"\r\n\r\n"No,--at least I don\'t know. If he does, he cannot express such a\r\nwish, because Clara is so headstrong. Patrick, in my heart I do not\r\nbelieve that she cares for him. I have doubted it for some time."\r\n\r\n"But you wanted her to marry him."\r\n\r\n"So I did. It was an excellent match, and in a certain way she did\r\nlike him; and then, you know, there was that great danger about poor\r\nOwen. It was a great danger then. But now she is so determined about\r\nthis, because she thinks it would be ungenerous to go back from her\r\nword; and in this way she will ruin the very man she wishes to serve.\r\nOf course he cannot break off the match if she persists in it. What\r\nI want you to perceive is this, that he, utterly penniless as he is,\r\nwill have to begin the world with a clog round his neck, because she\r\nis so obstinate. What could possibly be worse for him than a titled\r\nwife without a penny?" And in this way the countess pleaded her side\r\nof the question before her son.\r\n\r\nIt was quite true that she had been three times to Castle Richmond,\r\nand had thrice driven Aunt Letty into a state bordering on\r\ndistraction. If she could only get the Castle Richmond people to take\r\nit up as they ought to do! It was thus she argued with herself,--and\r\nwith Aunt Letty also, endeavouring to persuade her that these two\r\nyoung people would undoubtedly ruin each other, unless those who were\r\nreally wise and prudent, and who understood the world--such as Aunt\r\nLetty, for instance--would interfere to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAunt Letty on the whole did agree with her, though she greatly\r\ndisliked her. Miss Fitzgerald had strongly planted within her bosom\r\nthe prudent old-world notion, that young gentlefolks should not\r\nlove each other unless they have plenty of money; and that, if\r\nunfortunately such did love each other, it was better that they\r\nshould suffer all the pangs of hopeless love than marry and trust to\r\nGod and their wits for bread and cheese. To which opinion of Aunt\r\nLetty\'s, as well as to some others entertained by that lady with much\r\npertinacity, I cannot subscribe myself as an adherent.\r\n\r\nLady Desmond had wit enough to discover that Aunt Letty did agree\r\nwith her in the main, and on this account she was eager in seeking\r\nher assistance. Lady Fitzgerald of course could not be seen, and\r\nthere was no one else at Castle Richmond who could be supposed to\r\nhave any weight with Herbert. And therefore Lady Desmond was very\r\neloquent with Aunt Letty, talking much of the future miseries of the\r\ntwo young people, till the old lady had promised to use her best\r\nefforts in enlisting Lady Fitzgerald on the same side. "You cannot\r\nwonder, Miss Fitzgerald, that I should wish to put an end to the\r\ncruel position in which my poor girl is placed. You know how much a\r\ngirl suffers from that kind of thing."\r\n\r\nAunt Letty did dislike Lady Desmond very much; but, nevertheless, she\r\ncould not deny the truth of all this; and therefore it may be said\r\nthat the visits of the countess to Castle Richmond were on the whole\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nAnd the month wore itself away also in that sad household, and the\r\nFitzgeralds were gradually becoming used to their position. Family\r\ndiscussions were held among them as to what they should do, and where\r\nthey should live in future. Mr. Prendergast had written, seeing\r\nthat Owen had persisted in refusing to make the offer personally\r\nhimself--saying that there was no hurry for any removal. "Sir Owen,"\r\nhe said,--having considered deeply whether or no he would call him\r\nby the title or no, and having resolved that it would be best to do\r\nso at once--"Sir Owen was inclined to behave very generously. Lady\r\nFitzgerald could have the house and demesne at any rate for twelve\r\nmonths, and by that time the personal property left by Sir Thomas\r\nwould be realized, and there would be enough," Mr. Prendergast\r\nsaid, "for the three ladies to live \'in decent quiet comfort.\'" Mr.\r\nPrendergast had taken care before he left Castle Richmond that a will\r\nshould be made and duly executed by Sir Thomas, leaving what money\r\nhe had to his three children by name,--in trust for their mother\'s\r\nuse. Till the girls should be of age that trust would be vested in\r\nHerbert.\r\n\r\n"Decent quiet comfort!" said Mary to her brother and sister as they\r\nconned the letter over; "how comfortless it sounds!"\r\n\r\nAnd so the first month after the death of Sir Thomas passed by,\r\nand the misfortunes of the Fitzgerald family ceased to be the only\r\nsubject spoken of by the inhabitants of county Cork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR GOING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the month, Herbert began to prepare himself for facing\r\nthe world. The first question to be answered was that one which is\r\nso frequently asked in most families, but which had never yet been\r\nnecessary in this--What profession would he follow? All manners of\r\nways by which an educated man can earn his bread had been turned over\r\nin his mind, and in the minds of those who loved him, beginning with\r\nthe revenues of the Archbishop of Armagh, which was Aunt Letty\'s\r\nidea, and ending with a seat at a government desk, which was his own.\r\nMr. Prendergast had counselled the law; not his own lower branch of\r\nthe profession, but a barrister\'s full-blown wig, adding, in his\r\nletter to Lady Fitzgerald, that if Herbert would come to London, and\r\nsettle in chambers, he, Mr. Prendergast, would see that his life\r\nwas made agreeable to him. But Mr. Somers gave other advice. In\r\nthose days Assistant Poor-Law Commissioners were being appointed in\r\nIreland, almost by the score, and Mr. Somers declared that Herbert\r\nhad only to signify his wish for such a position, and he would get\r\nit. The interest which he had taken in the welfare of the poor around\r\nhim was well known, and as his own story was well known also, there\r\ncould be no doubt that the government would be willing to assist one\r\nso circumstanced, and who when assisted would make himself so useful.\r\nSuch was the advice of Mr. Somers; and he might have been right but\r\nfor this, that both Herbert and Lady Fitzgerald felt that it would\r\nbe well for them to move out of that neighbourhood,--out of Ireland\r\naltogether, if such could be possible.\r\n\r\nAunt Letty was strong for the Church. A young man who had\r\ndistinguished himself at the University so signally as her nephew\r\nhad done, taking his degree at the very first attempt, and that in\r\nso high a class of honour as the fourth, would not fail to succeed\r\nin the Church. He might not perhaps succeed as to Armagh; that she\r\nadmitted, but there were some thirty other bishoprics to be had, and\r\nit would be odd if, with his talents, he did not get one of them.\r\nThink what it would be if he were to return to his own country as\r\nBishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, as to which amalgamation of sees,\r\nhowever, Aunt Letty had her own ideas. He was slightly tainted with\r\nthe venom of Puseyism, Aunt Letty said to herself; but nothing\r\nwould dispel this with so much certainty as the theological studies\r\nnecessary for ordination. And then Aunt Letty talked it over by the\r\nhour together with Mrs. Townsend, and both those ladies were agreed\r\nthat Herbert should get himself ordained as quickly as possible;--not\r\nin England, where there might be danger even in ordination, but\r\nin good, wholesome, Protestant Ireland, where a Church of England\r\nclergyman was a clergyman of the Church of England, and not a priest,\r\nslipping about in the mud half way between England and Rome.\r\n\r\nHerbert himself was anxious to get some employment by which he might\r\nimmediately earn his bread, but not unnaturally wished that London\r\nshould be the scene of his work. Anywhere in Ireland he would be\r\nknown as the Fitzgerald who ought to have been Fitzgerald of Castle\r\nRichmond. And then too, he, as other young men, had an undefined\r\nidea, that as he must earn his bread London should be his ground.\r\nHe had at first been not ill inclined to that Church project, and\r\nhad thus given a sort of ground on which Aunt Letty was able to\r\nstand,--had, as it were, given her some authority for carrying on an\r\nagitation in furtherance of her own views; but Herbert himself soon\r\ngave up this idea. A man, he thought, to be a clergyman should have\r\na very strong predilection in favour of that profession; and so he\r\ngradually abandoned that idea,--actuated, as poor Aunt Letty feared,\r\nby the agency of the evil one, working through the means of Puseyism.\r\n\r\nHis mother and sisters were in favour of Mr. Prendergast\'s views, and\r\nas it was gradually found by them all that there would not be any\r\nimmediate pressure as regarded pecuniary means, that seemed at last\r\nto be their decision. Herbert would remain yet for three or four\r\nweeks at Castle Richmond, till matters there were somewhat more\r\nthoroughly settled, and would then put himself into the hands of Mr.\r\nPrendergast in London. Mr. Prendergast would select a legal tutor\r\nfor him, and proper legal chambers; and then not long afterwards his\r\nmother and sisters should follow, and they would live together at\r\nsome small villa residence near St. John\'s Wood Road, or perhaps out\r\nat Brompton.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing how quickly in this world of ours chaos will settle\r\nitself into decent and graceful order, when it is properly looked\r\nin the face, and handled with a steady hand which is not sparing of\r\nthe broom. Some three months since, everything at Castle Richmond\r\nwas ruin; such ruin, indeed, that the very power of living under it\r\nseemed to be doubtful. When first Mr. Prendergast arrived there, a\r\nfeeling came upon them all as though they might hardly dare to live\r\nin a world which would look at them as so thoroughly degraded. As\r\nregards means, they would be beggars! and as regards position, so\r\nmuch worse than beggars! A broken world was in truth falling about\r\ntheir ears, and it was felt to be impossible that they should endure\r\nits convulsions and yet live.\r\n\r\nBut now the world had fallen, the ruin had come, and they were\r\nalready strong in future hopes. They had dared to look at their\r\nchaos, and found that it still contained the elements of order.\r\nThere was much still that marred their happiness, and forbade the\r\njoyousness of other days. Their poor father had gone from them in\r\ntheir misery, and the house was still a house of mourning; and their\r\nmother too, though she bore up so wonderfully against her fate, and\r\nfor their sakes hoped and planned and listened to their wishes, was a\r\nstricken woman. That she would never smile again with any heartfelt\r\njoy they were all sure. But, nevertheless, their chaos was conquered,\r\nand there was hope that the fields of life would again show\r\nthemselves green and fruitful.\r\n\r\nOn one subject their mother never spoke to them, nor had even Herbert\r\ndared to speak to her: not a word had been said in that house since\r\nMr. Prendergast left it as to the future whereabouts or future doings\r\nof that man to whom she had once given her hand at the altar. But\r\nshe had ventured to ask by letter a question of Mr. Prendergast. Her\r\nquestion had been this: What must I do that he may not come to me or\r\nto my children? In answer to this Mr. Prendergast had told her, after\r\nsome delay, that he believed she need fear nothing. He had seen the\r\nman, and he thought that he might assure her that she would not be\r\ntroubled in that respect.\r\n\r\n"It is possible," said Mr. Prendergast, "that he may apply to you by\r\nletter for money. If so, give him no answer whatever, but send his\r\nletters to me."\r\n\r\n"And are you all going?" asked Mrs. Townsend of Aunt Letty, with a\r\nlachrymose voice soon after the fate of the family was decided.\r\nThey were sitting together with their knees over the fire in Mrs.\r\nTownsend\'s dining-parlour, in which the perilous state of the country\r\nhad been discussed by them for many a pleasant hour together.\r\n\r\n"Well, I think we shall; you see, my sister would never be happy\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"No, no; the shock and the change would be too great for her. Poor\r\nLady Fitzgerald! And when is that man coming into the house?"\r\n\r\n"What, Owen?"\r\n\r\n"Yes! Sir Owen I suppose he is now."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know; he does not seem to be in any hurry. I believe\r\nthat he has said that my sister may continue to live there if she\r\npleases. But of course she cannot do that."\r\n\r\n"They do say about the country," whispered Mrs. Townsend, "that he\r\nrefuses to be the heir at all. He certainly has not had any cards\r\nprinted with the title on them--I know that as a fact."\r\n\r\n"He is a very singular man, very. You know I never could bear him,"\r\nsaid Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\n"No, nor I either. He has not been to our church once these six\r\nmonths. But it\'s very odd, isn\'t it? Of course you know the story?"\r\n\r\n"What story?" asked Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\n"About Lady Clara. Owen Fitzgerald was dreadfully in love with her\r\nbefore your Herbert had ever seen her. And they do say that he has\r\nsworn his cousin shall never live if he marries her."\r\n\r\n"They can never marry now, you know. Only think of it. There would be\r\nthree hundred a year between them.--Not at present, that is," added\r\nAunt Letty, looking forward to a future period after her own death.\r\n\r\n"That is very little, very little indeed," said Mrs. Townsend,\r\nremembering, however, that she herself had married on less. "But,\r\nMiss Fitzgerald, if Herbert does not marry her do you think this Owen\r\nwill?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think she\'d have him. I am quite sure she would not."\r\n\r\n"Not when he has all the property, and the title too?"\r\n\r\n"No, nor double as much. What would people say of her if she did?\r\nBut, however, there is no fear, for she declares that nothing shall\r\ninduce her to give up her engagement with our Herbert."\r\n\r\nAnd so they discussed it backward and forward in every way, each\r\nhaving her own theory as to that singular rumour which was going\r\nabout the country, signifying that Owen had declined to accept the\r\ntitle. Aunt Letty, however, would not believe that any good could\r\ncome from so polluted a source, and declared that he had his own\r\nreasons for the delay. "It\'s not for any love of us," she said, "if\r\nhe refuses to take either that or the estate." And in this she was\r\nright. But she would have been more surprised still had she learned\r\nthat Owen\'s forbearance arose from a strong anxiety to do what was\r\njust in the matter.\r\n\r\n"And so Herbert won\'t go into the Church?"\r\n\r\nAnd Letty shook her head sorrowing.\r\n\r\n"\xc6neas would have been so glad to have taken him for a twelvemonth\'s\r\nreading," said Mrs. Townsend. "He could have come here, you know,\r\nwhen you went away, and been ordained at Cork, and got a curacy close\r\nin the neighbourhood, where he was known. It would have been so nice;\r\nwouldn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nAunt Letty would not exactly have advised the scheme as suggested by\r\nMrs. Townsend. Her ideas as to Herbert\'s clerical studies would have\r\nbeen higher than this. Trinity College, Dublin, was in her estimation\r\nthe only place left for good Church of England ecclesiastical\r\nteaching. But as Herbert was obstinately bent on declining sacerdotal\r\nlife, there was no use in dispelling Mrs. Townsend\'s bright vision.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all of no use," she said; "he is determined to go to the bar."\r\n\r\n"The bar is very respectable," said Mrs. Townsend, kindly.\r\n\r\n"And you mean to go with them, too?" said Mrs. Townsend, after\r\nanother pause. "You\'ll hardly be happy, I\'m thinking, so far away\r\nfrom your old home."\r\n\r\n"It is sad to change at my time of life," said Aunt Letty,\r\nplaintively. "I\'m sixty-two now."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said Mrs. Townsend, who, however, knew her age to a day.\r\n\r\n"Sixty-two if I live another week, and I have never yet had any home\r\nbut Castle Richmond. There I was born, and till the other day I\r\nhad every reason to trust that there I might die. But what does it\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s true of course; what does it matter where we are while we\r\nlinger in this vale of tears? But couldn\'t you get a little place for\r\nyourself somewhere near here? There\'s Callaghan\'s cottage, with the\r\ntwo-acre piece for a cow, and as nice a spot of a garden as there is\r\nin the county Cork."\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t separate myself from her now," said Aunt Letty, "for\r\nall the cottages and all the gardens in Ireland. The Lord has been\r\npleased to throw us together, and together we will finish our\r\npilgrimage. Whither she goes, I will go, and where she lodges, I will\r\nlodge; her people shall be my people, and her God my God." And then\r\nMrs. Townsend said nothing further of Callaghan\'s pretty cottage, or\r\nof the two-acre piece.\r\n\r\nBut one reason for her going Aunt Letty did not give, even to her\r\nfriend Mrs. Townsend. Her income, that which belonged exclusively\r\nto herself, was in no way affected by these sad Castle Richmond\r\nrevolutions. This was a comfortable,--we may say a generous provision\r\nfor an old maiden lady, amounting to some six hundred a year, settled\r\nupon her for life, and this, if added to what could be saved and\r\nscraped together, would enable them to live comfortably as far as\r\nmeans were concerned, in that suburban villa to which they were\r\nlooking forward. But without Aunt Letty\'s income that suburban villa\r\nmust be but a poor home. Mr. Prendergast had calculated that some\r\nfourteen thousand pounds would represent the remaining property of\r\nthe family, with which it would be necessary to purchase government\r\nstock. Such being the case, Aunt Letty\'s income was very material to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"I trust you will be able to find some one there who will preach the\r\ngospel to you," said Mrs. Townsend, in a tone that showed how serious\r\nwere her misgivings on the subject.\r\n\r\n"I will search for such a one at any rate," said Aunt Letty. "You\r\nneed not be afraid that I shall be a backslider."\r\n\r\n"But they have crosses now over the communion tables in the churches\r\nin England," said Mrs. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"I know it is very bad," said Aunt Letty. "But there will always be a\r\nremnant left. The Lord will not utterly desert us." And then she took\r\nher departure, leaving Mrs. Townsend with the conviction that the\r\nland to which her friend was going was one in which the light of the\r\ngospel no longer shone in its purity.\r\n\r\nIt was not wonderful that they should all be anxious to get away\r\nfrom Castle Richmond, for the house there was now not a pleasant one\r\nin which to live. Let all those who have houses and the adjuncts\r\nof houses think how considerable a part of their life\'s pleasures\r\nconsists in their interest in the things around them. When will the\r\nsea-kale be fit to cut, and when will the crocuses come up? will the\r\nviolets be sweeter than ever? and the geranium cuttings, are they\r\nthriving? we have dug, and manured, and sown, and we look forward to\r\nthe reaping, and to see our garners full. The very furniture which\r\nministers to our daily uses is loved and petted; and in decorating\r\nour rooms we educate ourselves in design. The place in church which\r\nhas been our own for years,--is not that dear to us, and the voice\r\nthat has told us of God\'s tidings--even though the drone become\r\nmore evident as it waxes in years, and though it grows feeble and\r\nindolent? And the faces of those who have lived around us, do we not\r\nlove them too, the servants who have worked for us, and the children\r\nwho have first toddled beneath our eyes and prattled in our ears, and\r\nnow run their strong races, screaming loudly, splashing us as they\r\npass--very unpleasantly? Do we not love them all? Do they not all\r\ncontribute to the great sum of our enjoyment? All men love such\r\nthings, more or less, even though they know it not. And women love\r\nthem even more than men.\r\n\r\nAnd the Fitzgeralds were about to leave them all. The early buds of\r\nspring were now showing themselves, but how was it possible that\r\nthey should look to them? One loves the bud because one expects the\r\nflower. The sea-kale now was beyond their notice, and though they\r\nplucked the crocuses, they did so with tears upon their cheeks.\r\nAfter much consideration the church had been abandoned by all except\r\nAunt Letty and Herbert. That Lady Fitzgerald should go there was\r\nimpossible, and the girls were only too glad to be allowed to stay\r\nwith their mother. And the schools in which they had taught since the\r\nfirst day in which teaching had been possible for them, had to be\r\nabandoned with such true pangs of heartfelt sorrow.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when their misery first came upon them, from the days\r\nwhen it first began to be understood that the world had gone wrong at\r\nCastle Richmond, this separation from the schools had commenced. The\r\nwork had been dropped for a while, but the dropping had in fact been\r\nfinal, and there was nothing further to be done than the saddest of\r\nall leavetaking. The girls had sent word to the children, perhaps\r\nimprudently, that they would go down and say a word of adieu to their\r\npupils. The children had of course told their mothers, and when the\r\ngirls reached the two neat buildings which stood at the corner of the\r\npark, there were there to meet them, not unnaturally, a concourse of\r\nwomen and children.\r\n\r\nIn former prosperous days the people about Castle Richmond had, as\r\na rule, been better to do than their neighbours. Money wages had\r\nbeen more plentiful, and there had been little or no subletting of\r\nland; the children had been somewhat more neatly clothed, and the\r\nwomen less haggard in their faces; but this difference was hardly\r\nperceptible any longer. To them, the Miss Fitzgeralds, looking at\r\nthe poverty-stricken assemblage, it almost seemed as though the\r\nmisfortune of their house had brought down its immediate consequences\r\non all who had lived within their circle; but this was the work\r\nof the famine. In those days one could rarely see any member of a\r\npeasant\'s family bearing in his face a look of health. The yellow\r\nmeal was a useful food--the most useful, doubtless, which could at\r\nthat time be found; but it was not one that was gratifying either to\r\nthe eye or palate.\r\n\r\nThe girls had almost regretted their offer before they had left the\r\nhouse. It would have been better, they said to themselves, to have\r\nhad the children up in the hall, and there to have spoken their\r\nfarewells, and made their little presents. The very entering those\r\nschoolrooms again would almost be too much for them; but this\r\nconsideration was now too late, and when they got to the corner of\r\nthe gate, they found that there was a crowd to receive them. "Mary,\r\nI must go back," said Emmeline, when she first saw them; but Aunt\r\nLetty, who was with them, stepped forward, and they soon found\r\nthemselves in the schoolroom.\r\n\r\n"We have come to say good-bye to you all," said Aunt Letty, trying to\r\nbegin a speech.\r\n\r\n"May the heavens be yer bed then, the lot of yez, for ye war always\r\ngood to the poor. May the Blessed Virgin guide and protect ye\r\nwherever ye be;"--a blessing against which Aunt Letty at once entered\r\na little inward protest, perturbed though she was in spirit. "May the\r\nheavens rain glory on yer heads, for ye war always the finest family\r\nthat war ever in the county Cork!"\r\n\r\n"You know, I dare say, that we are going to leave you," continued\r\nAunt Letty.\r\n\r\n"We knows it, we knows it; sorrow come to them as did it all. Faix,\r\nan\' there\'ll niver be any good in the counthry, at all at all, when\r\nyou\'re gone, Miss Emmeline; an\' what\'ll we do at all for the want\r\nof yez, and when shall we see the likes of yez? Eh, Miss Letty, but\r\nthere\'ll be sore eyes weeping for ye; and for her leddyship too; may\r\nthe Lord Almighty bless her, and presarve her, and carry her sowl\r\nto glory when she dies; for av there war iver a good woman on God\'s\r\n\'arth, that woman is Leddy Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\nAnd then Aunt Letty found that there was no necessity for her to\r\ncontinue her speech, and indeed no possibility of her doing so even\r\nif she were so minded. The children began to wail and cry, and\r\nthe mothers also mixed loud sobbings with their loud prayers; and\r\nEmmeline and Mary, dissolved in tears, sat themselves down, drawing\r\nto them the youngest bairns and those whom they had loved the best,\r\nkissing their sallow, famine-stricken, unwholesome faces, and weeping\r\nover them with a love of which hitherto they had been hardly\r\nconscious.\r\n\r\nThere was not much more in the way of speech possible to any of\r\nthem, for even Aunt Letty was far gone in tender wailing; and it\r\nwas wonderful to see the liberties that were taken even with that\r\nvenerable bonnet. The women had first of all taken hold of her hands\r\nto kiss them, and had kissed her feet, and her garments, and her\r\nshoulders, and then behind her back they had made crosses on her,\r\nalthough they knew how dreadfully she would have raged had she caught\r\nthem polluting her by such doings; and they grasped her arms and\r\nembraced them, till at last, those who were more daring, reached her\r\nforehead and her face, and poor old Aunt Letty, who in her emotion\r\ncould not now utter a syllable, was almost pulled to pieces among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMary and Emmeline had altogether surrendered themselves, and were\r\nthe centres of clusters of children who hung upon them. And the sobs\r\nnow were no longer low and tearful, but they had grown into long,\r\nprotracted groanings, and loud wailings, and clapping of hands, and\r\ntearings of the hair. O, my reader, have you ever seen a railway\r\ntrain taking its departure from an Irish station, with a freight\r\nof Irish emigrants? if so, you know how the hair is torn, and how\r\nthe hands are clapped, and how the low moanings gradually swell\r\ninto notes of loud lamentation. It means nothing, I have heard men\r\nsay,--men and women too. But such men and women are wrong. It means\r\nmuch; it means this: that those who are separated, not only love each\r\nother, but are anxious to tell each other that they so love. We have\r\nall heard of demonstrative people. A demonstrative person, I take\r\nit, is he who is desirous of speaking out what is in his heart. For\r\nmyself I am inclined to think that such speaking out has its good\r\nends. "The faculty of silence! is it not of all things the most\r\nbeautiful?" That is the doctrine preached by a great latter-day\r\nphilosopher; for myself, I think that the faculty of speech is\r\nmuch more beautiful--of speech if it be made but by howlings, and\r\nwailings, and loud clappings of the hand. What is in a man, let it\r\ncome out and be known to those around him; if it be bad it will find\r\ncorrection; if it be good it will spread and be beneficent.\r\n\r\nAnd then one woman made herself audible over the sobs of the crowding\r\nchildren; she was a gaunt, high-boned woman, but she would have been\r\ncomely, if not handsome, had not the famine come upon her. She held a\r\nbaby in her arms, and another little toddling thing had been hanging\r\non her dress till Emmeline had seen it, and plucked it away; and it\r\nwas now sitting in her lap quite composed, and sucking a piece of\r\ncake that had been given to it. "An\' it\'s a bad day for us all," said\r\nthe woman, beginning in a low voice, which became louder and louder\r\nas she went on; "it\'s a bad day for us all that takes away from us\r\nthe only rale friends that we iver had, and the back of my hand to\r\nthem that have come in the way, bringin\' sorrow, an\' desolation, an\'\r\nmisery on gentlefolks that have been good to the poor since iver the\r\npoor have been in the land; rale gentlefolks, sich as there ain\'t no\r\nothers to be found nowadays in any of these parts. O\'hone, o\'hone!\r\nbut it\'s a bad day for us and for the childer; for where shall we\r\nfind the dhrop to comfort us or the bit to ate when the sickness\r\ncomes on us, as it\'s likely to come now, when the Fitzgeralds is out\r\nof the counthry. May the Lord bless them, and keep them, and presarve\r\nthem, and the Holy Virgin have them in her keepin\'!"\r\n\r\n"Wh--i--s--h--h," said Aunt Letty, who could not allow such idolatry\r\nto pass by unobserved or unrebuked.\r\n\r\n"An\' shure the blessin\' of a poor woman cannot haram you," continued\r\nthe mother; "an\' I\'ll tell you what, neighbours, it\'ll be a bad day\r\nfor him that folk call the heir when he puts his foot in that house."\r\n\r\n"\'Deed an\' that\'s thrue for you, Bridget Magrath," said another voice\r\nfrom among the crowd of women.\r\n\r\n"A bad day intirely," continued the woman, with the baby; "av the\r\nhouse stans over his head when he does the like o\' that, there\'ll be\r\nno justice in the heavens."\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Magrath," said Aunt Letty, trying to interrupt her, "you\r\nmust not speak in that way; you are mistaken in supposing that Mr.\r\nOwen--"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll all live to see," said the woman; "for the time\'s comin\' quick\r\nupon us now. But it\'s a bad law that kills our ould masther over our\r\nheads, an\' takes away from us our ould misthress. An\' as for him they\r\ncalls Mr. Owen--"\r\n\r\nBut the ladies found it impossible to listen to her any longer, so\r\nwith some difficulty they extricated themselves from the crowd by\r\nwhich they were surrounded, and once more shaking hands with those\r\nwho were nearest to them escaped into the park, and made their way\r\nback towards the house.\r\n\r\nThey had not expected so much demonstration, and were not a little\r\ndisconcerted at the scene which had taken place. Aunt Letty had never\r\nbeen so handled in her life, and hardly knew how to make her bonnet\r\nsit comfortably on her head; and the two girls were speechless till\r\nthey were half across the park.\r\n\r\n"I am glad we have been," said Emmeline at last, as soon as the\r\nremains of her emotion would allow her to articulate her words.\r\n\r\n"It would have been dreadful to have gone away without seeing them,"\r\nsaid Mary. "Poor creatures, poor dear creatures; we shall never again\r\nhave any more people to be fond of us like that!"\r\n\r\n"There is no knowing," said Aunt Letty; "the Lord giveth and the Lord\r\ntaketh away, and blessed is the name of the Lord. You are both young,\r\nand may come back again; but for me--"\r\n\r\n"Dear Aunt Letty, if we come back you shall come too."\r\n\r\n"If I only thought that my bones could lie here near my brother\'s.\r\nBut never mind; what signifies it where our bones lie?" And then they\r\nwere silent for a while, till Aunt Letty spoke again. "I mean to be\r\nquite happy over in England; I believe I shall be happiest of you all\r\nif I can find any clergyman who is not half perverted to idolatry."\r\n\r\nThis took place some time before the ladies left Castle\r\nRichmond,--perhaps as much as three weeks; it was even before\r\nHerbert\'s departure, who started for London the day but one after the\r\nscene here recorded; he had gone to various places to take his last\r\nfarewell; to see the Townsends at the parsonage; to call on Father\r\nBarney at Kanturk, and had even shaken hands with the Rev. Mr.\r\nCreagh, at Gortnaclough. But one farewell visit had been put off\r\nfor the last. It was now arranged that he was to go over to Desmond\r\nCourt and see Clara before he went. There had been some difficulty\r\nin this, for Lady Desmond had at first declared that she could not\r\nfeel justified in asking him into her house; but the earl was now at\r\nhome, and her ladyship had at last given her consent: he was to see\r\nthe countess first, and was afterwards to see Clara--alone. He had\r\ndeclared that he would not go there unless he were to be allowed an\r\ninterview with her in private. The countess, as I have said, at last\r\nconsented, trusting that her previous eloquence might be efficacious\r\nin counteracting the ill effects of her daughter\'s imprudence. On\r\nthe day after that interview he was to start for London; "never to\r\nreturn," as he said to Emmeline, "unless he came to seek his wife."\r\n\r\n"But you will come to seek your wife," said Emmeline, stoutly; "I\r\nshall think you faint-hearted if you doubt it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST STAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day before his departure for London, Herbert Fitzgerald\r\nonce more got on his horse--the horse that was to be no longer his\r\nafter that day--and rode off towards Desmond Court. He had already\r\nperceived how foolish he had been in walking thither through the mud\r\nand rain when last he went there, and how much he had lost by his\r\nsad appearance that day, and by his want of personal comfort. So he\r\ndressed himself with some care--dressing not for his love, but for\r\nthe countess,--and taking his silver-mounted whip in his gloved\r\nhand, he got up on his well-groomed nag with more spirit than he had\r\nhitherto felt.\r\n\r\nNothing could be better than the manner in which, at this time,\r\nthe servants about Castle Richmond conducted themselves. Most of\r\nthem--indeed, all but three--had been told that they must go; and in\r\nso telling them, the truth had been explained. It had been "found,"\r\nAunt Letty said to one of the elder among them, that Mr. Herbert was\r\nnot the heir to the property, and therefore the family was obliged\r\nto go away. Mrs. Jones of course accompanied her mistress. Richard\r\nhad been told, both by Herbert and by Aunt Letty, that he had better\r\nremain and live on a small patch of land that should be provided\r\nfor him. But in answer to this he stated his intention of removing\r\nhimself to London. If the London air was fit for "my leddy and Miss\r\nLetty," it would be fit for him. "It\'s no good any more talking, Mr.\r\nHerbert," said Richard, "I main to go." So there was no more talking,\r\nand he did go.\r\n\r\nBut all the other servants took their month\'s warning with tears and\r\nblessings, and strove one beyond another how they might best serve\r\nthe ladies of the family to the end. "I\'d lose the little fingers\r\noff me to go with you, Miss Emmeline; so I would," said one poor\r\ngirl,--all in vain. If they could not keep a retinue of servants in\r\nIreland, it was clear enough that they could not keep them in London.\r\n\r\nThe groom who held the horse for Herbert to mount, touched his hat\r\nrespectfully as his young master rode off slowly down the avenue, and\r\nthen went back to the stables to meditate with awe on the changes\r\nwhich had happened in his time, and to bethink himself whether or no\r\nhe could bring himself to serve in the stables of Owen the usurper.\r\n\r\nHerbert did not take the direct road to Desmond Court, but went round\r\nas though he were going to Gortnaclough, and then turning away from\r\nthe Gortnaclough road, made his way by a cross lane towards Clady\r\nand the mountains. He hardly knew himself whether he had any object\r\nin this beyond one which he did not express even to himself,--that,\r\nnamely, of not being seen on the way leading to Desmond Court. But\r\nthis he did do, thereby riding out of the district with which he was\r\nmost thoroughly acquainted, and passing by cabins and patches of\r\nnow deserted land which were strange to him. It was a poor, bleak,\r\ndamp, undrained country, lying beyond the confines of his father\'s\r\nproperty, which in good days had never been pleasant to the eye,\r\nbut which now in these days--days that were so decidedly bad, was\r\nanything but pleasant. It was one of those tracts of land which had\r\nbeen divided and subdivided among the cottiers till the fields had\r\ndwindled down to parts of acres, each surrounded by rude low banks,\r\nwhich of themselves seemed to occupy a quarter of the surface of the\r\nland. The original landmarks, the big earthen banks,--banks so large\r\nthat a horse might walk on the top of them,--were still visible\r\nenough, showing to the practised eye what had once been the fields\r\ninto which the land had been divided; but these had since been\r\nbisected and crossected, and intersected by family arrangements,\r\nin which brothers had been jealous of brothers, and fathers of\r\ntheir children, till each little lot contained but a rood or two of\r\navailable surface.\r\n\r\nThis had been miserable enough to look at, even when those roods had\r\nbeen cropped with potatoes or oats; but now they were not cropped at\r\nall, nor was there preparation being made for cropping them. They had\r\nbeen let out under the con-acre system, at so much a rood, for the\r\npotato season, at rents amounting sometimes to ten or twelve pounds\r\nthe acre; but nobody would take them now. There, in that electoral\r\ndivision, the whole proceeds of such land would hardly have paid the\r\npoor rates, and therefore the land was left uncultivated.\r\n\r\nThe winter was over, for it was now April, and had any tillage been\r\nintended, it would have been commenced--even in Ireland. It was the\r\nbeginning of April, but the weather was still stormy and cold, and\r\nthe east wind, which, as a rule, strikes Ireland with but a light\r\nhand, was blowing sharply. On a sudden a squall of rain came on,--one\r\nof those spring squalls which are so piercingly cold, but which are\r\nsure to pass by rapidly, if the wayfarer will have patience to wait\r\nfor them. Herbert, remembering his former discomfiture, resolved that\r\nhe would have such patience, and dismounting from his horse at a\r\ncabin on the road-side, entered it himself, and led his horse in\r\nafter him. In England no one would think of taking his steed into a\r\npoor man\'s cottage, and would hardly put his beast into a cottager\'s\r\nshed without leave asked and granted; but people are more intimate\r\nwith each other, and take greater liberties in Ireland. It is\r\nno uncommon thing on a wet hunting-day to see a cabin packed\r\nwith horses, and the children moving about among them, almost as\r\nunconcernedly as though the animals were pigs. But then the Irish\r\nhorses are so well mannered and good-natured.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was one abutting as it were on the road, not standing back\r\nupon the land, as is most customary; and it was built in an angle\r\nat a spot where the road made a turn, so that two sides of it stood\r\nclose out in the wayside. It was small and wretched to look at,\r\nwithout any sort of outside shed, or even a scrap of potato-garden\r\nattached to it,--a miserable, low-roofed, damp, ragged tenement, as\r\nwretched as any that might be seen even in the county Cork.\r\n\r\nBut the nakedness of the exterior was as nothing to the nakedness\r\nof the interior. When Herbert entered, followed by his horse, his\r\neye glanced round the dark place, and it seemed to be empty of\r\neverything. There was no fire on the hearth, though a fire on the\r\nhearth is the easiest of all luxuries for an Irishman to acquire, and\r\nthe last which he is willing to lose. There was not an article of\r\nfurniture in the whole place; neither chairs, nor table, nor bed, nor\r\ndresser; there was there neither dish, nor cup, nor plate, nor even\r\nthe iron pot in which all the cookery of the Irish cottiers\' menage\r\nis usually carried on. Beneath his feet was the damp earthen floor,\r\nand around him were damp, cracked walls, and over his head was the\r\nold lumpy thatch, through which the water was already dropping; but\r\ninside was to be seen none of those articles of daily use which are\r\nusually to be found in the houses even of the poorest.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, the place was inhabited. Squatting in the middle\r\nof the cabin, seated on her legs crossed under her, with nothing\r\nbetween her and the wet earth, there crouched a woman with a child\r\nin her arms. At first, so dark was the place, Herbert hardly thought\r\nthat the object before him was a human being. She did not move when\r\nhe entered, or speak to him, or in any way show sign of surprise\r\nthat he should have come there. There was room for him and his horse\r\nwithout pushing her from her place; and, as it seemed, he might have\r\nstayed there and taken his departure without any sign having been\r\nmade by her.\r\n\r\nBut as his eyes became used to the light he saw her eyes gleaming\r\nbrightly through the gloom. They were very large and bright as they\r\nturned round upon him while he moved--large and bright, but with a\r\ndull, unwholesome brightness,--a brightness that had in it none of\r\nthe light of life.\r\n\r\nAnd then he looked at her more closely. She had on her some rag of\r\nclothing which barely sufficed to cover her nakedness, and the baby\r\nwhich she held in her arms was covered in some sort; but he could\r\nsee, as he came to stand close over her, that these garments were but\r\nloose rags which were hardly fastened round her body. Her rough short\r\nhair hung down upon her back, clotted with dirt, and the head and\r\nface of the child which she held was covered with dirt and sores. On\r\nno more wretched object, in its desolate solitude, did the eye of man\r\never fall.\r\n\r\nIn those days there was a form of face which came upon the sufferers\r\nwhen their state of misery was far advanced, and which was a sure\r\nsign that their last stage of misery was nearly run. The mouth would\r\nfall and seem to hang, the lips at the two ends of the mouth would be\r\ndragged down, and the lower parts of the cheeks would fall as though\r\nthey had been dragged and pulled. There were no signs of acute agony\r\nwhen this phasis of countenance was to be seen, none of the horrid\r\nsymptoms of gnawing hunger by which one generally supposes that\r\nfamine is accompanied. The look is one of apathy, desolation, and\r\ndeath. When custom had made these signs easily legible, the poor\r\ndoomed wretch was known with certainty. "It\'s no use in life meddling\r\nwith him; he\'s gone," said a lady to me in the far west of the south\r\nof Ireland, while the poor boy, whose doom was thus spoken, stood by\r\nlistening. Her delicacy did not equal her energy in doing good,--for\r\nshe did much good; but in truth it was difficult to be delicate when\r\nthe hands were so full. And then she pointed out to me the signs on\r\nthe lad\'s face, and I found that her reading was correct.\r\n\r\nThe famine was not old enough at the time of which we are speaking\r\nfor Herbert to have learned all this, or he would have known that\r\nthere was no hope left in this world for the poor creature whom he\r\nsaw before him. The skin of her cheek had fallen, and her mouth was\r\ndragged, and the mark of death was upon her; but the agony of want\r\nwas past. She sat there listless, indifferent, hardly capable of\r\nsuffering, even for her child, waiting her doom unconsciously.\r\n\r\nAs he had entered without eliciting a word from her, so might he have\r\ndeparted without any outward sign of notice; but this would have been\r\nimpossible on his part. "I have come in out of the rain for shelter,"\r\nsaid he, looking down on her.\r\n\r\n"Out o\' the rain, is it?" said she, still fixing on him her glassy\r\nbright eyes. "Yer honour\'s welcome thin." But she did not attempt to\r\nmove, nor show any of those symptoms of reverence which are habitual\r\nto the Irish when those of a higher rank enter their cabins.\r\n\r\n"You seem to be very poorly off here," said Herbert, looking round\r\nthe bare walls of the cabin. "Have you no chair, and no bed to lie\r\non?"\r\n\r\n"\'Deed no," said she.\r\n\r\n"And no fire?" said he, for the damp and chill of the place struck\r\nthrough to his bones.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed no," she said again; but she made no wail as to her wants, and\r\nuttered no complaint as to her misery.\r\n\r\n"And are you living here by yourself, without furniture or utensils\r\nof any kind?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s jist as yer honour sees it," answered she.\r\n\r\nFor a while Herbert stood still, looking round him, for the woman was\r\nso motionless and uncommunicative that he hardly knew how to talk\r\nto her. That she was in the lowest depth of distress was evident\r\nenough, and it behoved him to administer to her immediate wants\r\nbefore he left her; but what could he do for one who seemed to be so\r\nindifferent to herself? He stood for a time looking round him till he\r\ncould see through the gloom that there was a bundle of straw lying in\r\nthe dark corner beyond the hearth, and that the straw was huddled up,\r\nas though there were something lying under it. Seeing this he left\r\nthe bridle of his horse, and stepping across the cabin moved the\r\nstraw with the handle of his whip. As he did so he turned his back\r\nfrom the wall in which the small window-hole had been pierced, so\r\nthat a gleam of light fell upon the bundle at his feet, and he could\r\nsee that the body of a child was lying there, stripped of every\r\nvestige of clothing.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two he said nothing--hardly, indeed, knowing how to\r\nspeak, and looking from the corpselike woman back to the lifelike\r\ncorpse, and then from the corpse back to the woman, as though he\r\nexpected that she would say something unasked. But she did not say a\r\nword, though she so turned her head that her eyes rested on him.\r\n\r\nHe then knelt down and put his hand upon the body, and found that\r\nit was not yet stone cold. The child apparently had been about four\r\nyears old, while that still living in her arms might perhaps be half\r\nthat age.\r\n\r\n"Was she your own?" asked Herbert, speaking hardly above his breath.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed, yes!" said the woman. "She was my own, own little Kitty." But\r\nthere was no tear in her eye or gurgling sob audible from her throat.\r\n\r\n"And when did she die?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed, thin, and I don\'t jist know--not exactly;" and sinking lower\r\ndown upon her haunches, she put up to her forehead the hand with\r\nwhich she had supported herself on the floor--the hand which was not\r\noccupied with the baby, and pushing back with it the loose hairs from\r\nher face, tried to make an effort at thinking.\r\n\r\n"She was alive in the night, wasn\'t she?" he said.\r\n\r\n"I b\'lieve thin she was, yer honour. \'Twas broad day, I\'m thinking,\r\nwhen she guv\' over moaning. She warn\'t that way when he went away."\r\n\r\n"And who\'s he?"\r\n\r\n"Jist Mike, thin."\r\n\r\n"And is Mike your husband?" he asked. She was not very willing to\r\ntalk; but it appeared at last that Mike was her husband, and that\r\nhaving become a cripple through rheumatism, he had not been able to\r\nwork on the roads. In this condition he and his should of course have\r\ngone into a poor-house. It was easy enough to give such advice in\r\nsuch cases when one came across them, and such advice when given\r\nat that time was usually followed; but there were so many who had\r\nno advice, who could get no aid, who knew not which way to turn\r\nthemselves! This wretched man had succeeded in finding some one who\r\nwould give him his food--food enough to keep himself alive--for such\r\nwork as he could do in spite of his rheumatism, and this work to\r\nthe last he would not abandon. Even this was better to him than\r\nthe poor-house. But then, as long as a man found work out of the\r\npoor-house, his wife and children would not be admitted into it. They\r\nwould not be admitted if the fact of the working husband was known.\r\nThe rule in itself was salutary, as without it a man could work,\r\nearning such wages as were adjudged to be needful for a family, and\r\nat the same time send his wife and children to be supported on the\r\nrates. But in some cases, such as this, it pressed very cruelly.\r\nExceptions were of course made in such cases, if they were known: but\r\nthen it was so hard to know them!\r\n\r\nThis man Mike, the husband of that woman, and the father of those\r\nchildren, alive and dead, had now gone to his work, leaving his home\r\nwithout one morsel of food within it, and the wife of his bosom\r\nand children of his love without the hope of getting any. And then\r\nlooking closely round him, Herbert could see that a small basin or\r\nbowl lay on the floor near her, capable of holding perhaps a pint;\r\nand on lifting it he saw that there still clung to it a few grains\r\nof uncooked Indian corn-flour--the yellow meal, as it was called.\r\nHer husband, she said at last, had brought home with him in his\r\ncap a handful of this flour, stolen from the place where he was\r\nworking--perhaps a quarter of a pound, then worth over a farthing,\r\nand she had mixed this with water in a basin; and this was the food\r\nwhich had sustained her, or rather had not sustained her, since\r\nyesterday morning--her and her two children, the one that was living\r\nand the one that was dead.\r\n\r\nSuch was her story, told by her in the fewest of words. And then he\r\nasked her as to her hopes for the future. But though she cared, as\r\nit seemed, but little for the past, for the future she cared less.\r\n"\'Deed, thin, an\' I don\'t jist know." She would say no more than\r\nthat, and would not even raise her voice to ask for alms when he\r\npitied her in her misery. But with her the agony of death was already\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"And the child that you have in your arms," he said, "is it not\r\ncold?" And he stood close over her, and put out his hand and touched\r\nthe baby\'s body. As he did so, she made some motion as though to\r\narrange the clothing closer round the child\'s limbs, but Herbert\r\ncould see that she was making an effort to hide her own nakedness. It\r\nwas the only effort that she made while he stood there beside her.\r\n\r\n"Is she not cold?" he said again, when he had turned his face away to\r\nrelieve her from her embarrassment.\r\n\r\n"Cowld," she muttered, with a vacant face and wondering tone of\r\nvoice, as though she did not quite understand him. "I suppose she is\r\ncould. Why wouldn\'t she be could? We\'re could enough, if that\'s all."\r\nBut still she did not stir from the spot on which she sat; and the\r\nchild, though it gave from time to time a low moan that was almost\r\ninaudible, lay still in her arms, with its big eyes staring into\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\nHe felt that he was stricken with horror as he remained there in the\r\ncabin with the dying woman and the naked corpse of the poor dead\r\nchild. But what was he to do? He could not go and leave them without\r\nsuccour. The woman had made no plaint of her suffering, and had asked\r\nfor nothing; but he felt that it would be impossible to abandon her\r\nwithout offering her relief; nor was it possible that he should leave\r\nthe body of the child in that horribly ghastly state. So he took from\r\nhis pocket his silk handkerchief, and, returning to the corner of the\r\ncabin, spread it as a covering over the corpse. At first he did not\r\nlike to touch the small naked dwindled remains of humanity from which\r\nlife had fled; but gradually he overcame his disgust, and kneeling\r\ndown, he straightened the limbs and closed the eyes, and folded the\r\nhandkerchief round the slender body. The mother looked on him the\r\nwhile, shaking her head slowly, as though asking him with all the\r\nvoice that was left to her, whether it were not piteous; but of words\r\nshe still uttered none.\r\n\r\nAnd then he took from his pocket a silver coin or two, and tendered\r\nthem to her. These she did take, muttering some word of thanks, but\r\nthey caused in her no emotion of joy. "She was there waiting," she\r\nsaid, "till Mike should return," and there she would still wait, even\r\nthough she should die with the silver in her hand.\r\n\r\n"I will send some one to you," he said, as he took his departure;\r\n"some one that shall take the poor child and bury it, and who shall\r\nmove you and the other one into the workhouse." She thanked him once\r\nmore with some low muttered words, but the promise brought her no\r\njoy. And when the succour came it was all too late, for the mother\r\nand the two children never left the cabin till they left it together,\r\nwrapped in their workhouse shrouds.\r\n\r\nHerbert, as he remounted his horse and rode quietly on, forgot for a\r\nwhile both himself and Clara Desmond. Whatever might be the extent\r\nof his own calamity, how could he think himself unhappy after what\r\nhe had seen? how could he repine at aught that the world had done\r\nfor him, having now witnessed to how low a state of misery a fellow\r\nhuman being might be brought? Could he, after that, dare to consider\r\nhimself unfortunate?\r\n\r\nBefore he reached Desmond Court he did make some arrangements for\r\nthe poor woman, and directed that a cart might be sent for her, so\r\nthat she might be carried to the union workhouse at Kanturk. But his\r\nefforts in her service were of little avail. People then did not\r\nthink much of a dying woman, and were in no special hurry to obey\r\nHerbert\'s behest.\r\n\r\n"A woman to be carried to the union, is it? For Mr. Fitzgerald, eh?\r\nWhat Mr. Fitzgerald says must be done, in course. But sure av\' it\'s\r\ndone before dark, won\'t that be time enough for the likes of her?"\r\n\r\nBut had they flown to the spot on the wings of love, it would not\r\nhave sufficed to prolong her life one day. Her doom had been spoken\r\nbefore Herbert had entered the cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nFAREWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was two hours later than he had intended as he rode up the avenue\r\nto Lady Desmond\'s gate, and his chief thought at the moment was how\r\nhe should describe to the countess the scene he had just witnessed.\r\nWhy describe it at all? That is what we should all say. He had come\r\nthere to talk about other things--about other things which must be\r\ndiscussed, and which would require all his wits. Let him keep that\r\npoor woman on his mind, but not embarrass himself with any mention of\r\nher for the present. This, no doubt, would have been wise if only it\r\nhad been possible; but out of the full heart the mouth speaks.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Desmond had not witnessed the scene which I have attempted\r\nto describe, and her heart, therefore, was not full of it, and\r\nwas not inclined to be so filled. And so, in answer to Herbert\'s\r\nexclamation, "Oh, Lady Desmond, I have seen such a sight!" she gave\r\nhim but little encouragement to describe it, and by her coldness,\r\nreserve, and dignity, soon quelled the expression of his feelings.\r\n\r\nThe earl was present and shook hands very cordially with Herbert when\r\nhe entered the room; and he, being more susceptible as being younger,\r\nand not having yet become habituated to the famine as his mother was,\r\ndid express some eager sympathy. He would immediately go down, or\r\nsend Fahy with the car, and have her brought up and saved; but his\r\nmother had other work to do and soon put a stop to all this.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald," said she, speaking with a smile upon her face, and\r\nwith much high-bred dignity of demeanour, "as you and Lady Clara\r\nboth wish to see each other before you leave the country, and as\r\nyou have known each other so intimately, and considering all the\r\ncircumstances, I have not thought it well absolutely to forbid an\r\ninterview. But I do doubt its expediency; I do, indeed. And Lord\r\nDesmond, who feels for your late misfortune as we all do, perfectly\r\nagrees with me. He thinks that it would be much wiser for you both\r\nto have parted without the pain of a meeting, seeing how impossible\r\nit is that you should ever be more to each other than you are now."\r\nAnd then she appealed to her son, who stood by, looking not quite so\r\nwise, nor even quite so decided as his mother\'s words would seem to\r\nmake him.\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; upon my word I don\'t see how it\'s to be," said the young\r\nearl. "I am deuced sorry for it for one, and I wish I was well off,\r\nso that I could give Clara a pot of money, and then I should not care\r\nso much about your not being the baronet."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you must see, Mr. Fitzgerald, and I know that you do see\r\nit because you have very properly said so, that a marriage between\r\nyou and Lady Clara is now impossible. For her such an engagement\r\nwould be very bad--very bad indeed; but for you it would be utter\r\nruin. Indeed, it would be ruin for you both. Unencumbered as you will\r\nbe, and with the good connection which you will have, and with your\r\nexcellent talents, it will be quite within your reach to win for\r\nyourself a high position. But with you, as with other gentlemen who\r\nhave to work their way, marriage must come late in life, unless\r\nyou marry an heiress. This I think is thoroughly understood by all\r\npeople in our position; and I am sure that it is understood by your\r\nexcellent mother, for whom I always had and still have the most\r\nunfeigned respect. As this is so undoubtedly the case, and as I\r\ncannot of course consent that Lady Clara should remain hampered by\r\nan engagement which would in all human probability hang over the ten\r\nbest years of her life, I thought it wise that you should not see\r\neach other. I have, however, allowed myself to be overruled; and\r\nnow I must only trust to your honour, forbearance, and prudence to\r\nprotect my child from what might possibly be the ill effects of her\r\nown affectionate feelings. That she is romantic,--enthusiastic to\r\na fault I should perhaps rather call it--I need not tell you. She\r\nthinks that your misfortune demands from her a sacrifice of herself;\r\nbut you, I know, will feel that, even were such a sacrifice available\r\nto you, it would not become you to accept it. Because you have\r\nfallen, you will not wish to drag her down; more especially as you\r\ncan rise again--and she could not."\r\n\r\nSo spoke the countess, with much worldly wisdom, and with\r\nconsiderable tact in adjusting her words to the object which she had\r\nin view. Herbert, as he stood before her silent during the period of\r\nher oration, did feel that it would be well for him to give up his\r\nlove, and go away in utter solitude of heart to those dingy studies\r\nwhich Mr. Prendergast was preparing for him. His love, or rather\r\nthe assurance of Clara\'s love, had been his great consolation. But\r\nwhat right had he, with all the advantages of youth, and health, and\r\nfriends, and education, to require consolation? And then from moment\r\nto moment he thought of the woman whom he had left in the cabin, and\r\nconfessed that he did not dare to call himself unhappy.\r\n\r\nHe had listened attentively, although he did thus think of other\r\neloquence besides that of the countess--of the eloquence of that\r\nsilent, solitary, dying woman; but when she had done he hardly knew\r\nwhat to say for himself. She did make him feel that it would be\r\nungenerous in him to persist in his engagement; but then again,\r\nClara\'s letters and his sister\'s arguments had made him feel that it\r\nwas impossible to abandon it. They pleaded of heart-feelings so well\r\nthat he could not resist them; and the countess--she pleaded so well\r\nas to world\'s prudence that he could not resist her.\r\n\r\n"I would not willingly do anything to injure Lady Clara," he said.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we all knew," said the young earl. "You see, what is\r\na girl to do like her? Love in a cottage is all very well, and all\r\nthat; and as for riches, I don\'t care about them. It would be a\r\npity if I did, for I shall be about the poorest nobleman in the\r\nthree kingdoms, I suppose. But a chap when he marries should have\r\nsomething; shouldn\'t he now?"\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth the earl had been very much divided in his opinions\r\nsince he had come home, veering round a point or two this way or a\r\npoint or two that, in obedience to the blast of eloquence to which\r\nhe might be last subjected. But latterly the idea had grown upon him\r\nthat Clara might possibly marry Owen Fitzgerald. There was about\r\nOwen a strange fascination which all felt who had once loved him. To\r\nthe world he was rough and haughty, imperious in his commands, and\r\nexacting even in his fellowship; but to the few whom he absolutely\r\nloved, whom he had taken into his heart\'s core, no man ever was more\r\ntender or more gracious. Clara, though she had resolved to banish\r\nhim from her heart, had found it impossible to do so till Herbert\'s\r\nmisfortunes had given him a charm in her eyes which was not all his\r\nown. Clara\'s mother had loved him--had loved him as she never before\r\nhad loved; and now she loved him still, though she had so strongly\r\ndetermined that her love should be that of a mother, and not that\r\nof a wife. And the young earl, now that Owen\'s name was again rife\r\nin his ears, remembered all the pleasantness of former days. He had\r\nnever again found such a companion as Owen had been. He had met no\r\nother friend to whom he could talk of sport and a man\'s outward\r\npleasures when his mind was that way given, and to whom he could also\r\ntalk of soft inward things,--the heart\'s feelings, and aspirations,\r\nand wants. Owen would be as tender with him as a woman, allowing the\r\nyoung lad\'s arm round his body, listening to words which the outer\r\nworld would have called bosh--and have derided as girlish. So at\r\nleast thought the young earl to himself. And all boys long to be\r\nallowed utterance occasionally for these soft tender things;--as\r\nalso do all men, unless the devil\'s share in the world has become\r\naltogether uppermost with them.\r\n\r\nAnd the young lad\'s heart hankered after his old friend. He had\r\nlistened to his sister, and for a while had taken her part; but his\r\nmother had since whispered to him that Owen would now be the better\r\nsuitor, the preferable brother-in-law; and that in fact Clara loved\r\nOwen the best, though she felt herself bound by honour to his\r\nkinsman. And then she reminded her son of Clara\'s former love for\r\nOwen--a love which he himself had witnessed; and he thought of the\r\nday when with so much regret he had told his friend that he was\r\nunsuited to wed with an earl\'s penniless daughter. Of the subsequent\r\npleasantness which had come with Herbert\'s arrival, he had seen\r\nlittle or nothing. He had been told by letter that Herbert\r\nFitzgerald, the prosperous heir of Castle Richmond, was to be his\r\nfuture brother-in-law, and he had been satisfied. But now, if Owen\r\ncould return--how pleasant it would be!\r\n\r\n"But a chap when he marries should have something; shouldn\'t he now?"\r\nSo spoke the young earl, re-echoing his mother\'s prudence.\r\n\r\nHerbert did not quite like this interference on the boy\'s part. Was\r\nhe to explain to a young lad from Eton what his future intentions\r\nwere with reference to his mode of living and period of marriage? "Of\r\ncourse," he said, addressing himself to the countess, "I shall not\r\ninsist on an engagement made under such different circumstances."\r\n\r\n"Nor will you allow her to do so through a romantic feeling of\r\ngenerosity," said the countess.\r\n\r\n"You should know your own daughter, Lady Desmond, better than I do,"\r\nhe answered; "but I cannot say what I may do at her instance till I\r\nshall have seen her."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that you will allow a girl of her age to talk you\r\ninto a proceeding which you know to be wrong?"\r\n\r\n"I will allow no one," he said, "to talk me into a proceeding which\r\nI know to be wrong; nor will I allow any one to talk me out of a\r\nproceeding which I believe to be right." And then, having uttered\r\nthese somewhat grandiloquent words, he shut himself up as though\r\nthere were no longer any need for discussing the subject.\r\n\r\n"My poor child!" said the countess, in a low tremulous voice, as\r\nthough she did not intend him to hear them. "My poor unfortunate\r\nchild!" Herbert as he did hear them thought of the woman in the\r\ncabin, and of her misfortunes and of her children. "Come, Patrick,"\r\ncontinued the countess, "it is perhaps useless for us to say anything\r\nfurther at present. If you will remain here, Mr. Fitzgerald, for\r\na minute or two, I will send Lady Clara to wait upon you;" and\r\nthen curtsying with great dignity she withdrew, and the young\r\nearl scuffled out after her. "Mamma," he said, as he went, "he is\r\ndetermined that he will have her."\r\n\r\n"My poor child!" answered the countess.\r\n\r\n"And if I were in his place I should be determined also. You may as\r\nwell give it up. Not but that I like Owen a thousand times the best."\r\n\r\nHerbert did wait there for some five minutes, and then the door was\r\nopened very gently, was gently closed again, and Clara Desmond was in\r\nthe room. He came towards her respectfully, holding out his hand that\r\nhe might take hers; but before he had thought of how she would act\r\nshe was in his arms. Hitherto, of all betrothed maidens, she had been\r\nthe most retiring. Sometimes he had thought her cold when she had\r\nleft the seat by his side to go and nestle closely by his sister. She\r\nhad avoided the touch of his hand and the pressure of his arm, and\r\nhad gone from him speechless, if not with anger then with dismay,\r\nwhen he had carried the warmth of his love beyond the touch of his\r\nhand or the pressure of his arm. But now she rushed into his embrace\r\nand hid her face upon his shoulder, as though she were over glad to\r\nreturn to the heart from which those around her had endeavoured to\r\nbanish her. Was he or was he not to speak of his love? That had been\r\nthe question which he had asked himself when left alone there for\r\nthose five minutes, with the eloquence of the countess ringing in his\r\nears. Now that question had in truth been answered for him.\r\n\r\n"Herbert," she said, "Herbert! I have so sorrowed for you; but I know\r\nthat you have borne it like a man."\r\n\r\nShe was thinking of what he had now half forgotten,--the position\r\nwhich he had lost, those hopes which had all been shipwrecked, his\r\ntitle surrendered to another, and his lost estates. She was thinking\r\nof them as the loss affected him; but he, he had reconciled himself\r\nto all that,--unless all that were to separate him from his promised\r\nbride.\r\n\r\n"Dearest Clara," he said, with his arm close round her waist, while\r\nneither anger nor dismay appeared to disturb the sweetness of that\r\nposition, "the letter which you wrote me has been my chief comfort."\r\nNow if he had any intention of liberating Clara from the bond of her\r\nengagement,--if he really had any feeling that it behoved him not\r\nto involve her in the worldly losses which had come upon him,--he\r\nwas taking a very bad way of carrying out his views in that respect.\r\nInstead of confessing the comfort which he had received from that\r\nletter, and holding her close to his breast while he did confess it,\r\nhe should have stood away from her--quite as far apart as he had done\r\nfrom the countess; and he should have argued with her, showing her\r\nhow foolish and imprudent her letter had been, explaining that it\r\nbehoved her now to repress her feelings, and teaching her that peers\'\r\ndaughters as well as housemaids should look out for situations which\r\nwould suit them, guided by prudence and a view to the wages,--not\r\nfollow the dictates of impulse and of the heart. This is what he\r\nshould have done, according, I believe, to the views of most men and\r\nwomen. Instead of that he held her there as close as he could hold\r\nher, and left her to do the most of the speaking. I think he was\r\nright. According to my ideas woman\'s love should be regarded as\r\nfair prize of war,--as long as the war has been carried on with due\r\nadherence to the recognized law of nations. When it has been fairly\r\nwon, let it be firmly held. I have no opinion of that theory of\r\ngiving up.\r\n\r\n"You knew that I would not abandon you! Did you not know it? say that\r\nyou knew it?" said Clara, and then she insisted on having an answer.\r\n\r\n"I could hardly dare to think that there was so much happiness left\r\nfor me," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Then you were a traitor to your love, sir; a false traitor." But\r\ndeep as was the offence for which she arraigned him, it was clear\r\nto see that the pardon came as quick as the conviction. "And was\r\nEmmeline so untrue to me also as to believe that?"\r\n\r\n"Emmeline said--" and then he told her what Emmeline had said.\r\n\r\n"Dearest, dearest Emmeline! give her a whole heart-load of love from\r\nme; now mind you do,--and to Mary, too. And remember this, sir; that\r\nI love Emmeline ten times better than I do you; twenty times--,\r\nbecause she knew me. Oh, if she had mistrusted me--!"\r\n\r\n"And do you think that I mistrusted you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you did; you know you did, sir. You wrote and told me so;--and\r\nnow, this very day, you come here to act as though you mistrusted me\r\nstill. You know you have, only you have not the courage to go on with\r\nthe acting."\r\n\r\nAnd then he began to defend himself, showing how ill it would have\r\nbecome him to have kept her bound to her engagements had she feared\r\npoverty as most girls in her position would have feared it. But on\r\nthis point she would not hear much from him, lest the very fact of\r\nher hearing it should make it seem that such a line of conduct were\r\npossible to her.\r\n\r\n"You know nothing about most girls, sir, or about any, I am afraid;\r\nnot even about one. And if most girls were frightfully heartless,\r\nwhich they are not, what right had you to liken me to most girls?\r\nEmmeline knew better, and why could not you take her as a type of\r\nmost girls? You have behaved very badly, Master Herbert, and you know\r\nit; and nothing on earth shall make me forgive you; nothing--but\r\nyour promise that you will not so misjudge me any more." And then\r\nthe tears came to his eyes, and her face was again hidden on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was not very probable that after such a commencement the interview\r\nwould terminate in a manner favourable to the wishes of the countess.\r\nClara swore to her lover that she had given him all that she had to\r\ngive,--her heart, and will, and very self; and swore, also, that she\r\ncould not and would not take back the gift. She would remain as she\r\nwas now as long as he thought proper, and would come to him whenever\r\nhe should tell her that his home was large enough for them both. And\r\nso that matter was settled between them.\r\n\r\nThen she had much to say about his mother and sisters, and a word\r\ntoo about his poor father. And now that it was settled between them\r\nso fixedly, that come what might they were to float together in the\r\nsame boat down the river of life, she had a question or two also to\r\nask, and her approbation to give or to withhold, as to his future\r\nprospects. He was not to think, she told him, of deciding on anything\r\nwithout at any rate telling her. So he had to explain to her all the\r\nfamily plans, making her know why he had decided on the law as his\r\nown path to fortune, and asking for and obtaining her consent to all\r\nhis proposed measures.\r\n\r\nIn this way her view of the matter became more and more firmly\r\nadopted as that which should be the view resolutely to be taken by\r\nthem both. The countess had felt that that interview would be fatal\r\nto her; and she had been right. But how could she have prevented it?\r\nTwenty times she had resolved that she would prevent it; but twenty\r\ntimes she had been forced to confess that she was powerless to do so.\r\nIn these days a mother even can only exercise such power over a child\r\nas public opinion permits her to use. "Mother, it was you who brought\r\nus together, and you cannot separate us now." That had always been\r\nClara\'s argument, leaving the countess helpless, except as far as she\r\ncould work on Herbert\'s generosity. That she had tried,--and, as we\r\nhave seen, been foiled there also. If only she could have taken her\r\ndaughter away while the Castle Richmond family were still mersed in\r\nthe bitter depth of their suffering,--at that moment when the blows\r\nwere falling on them! Then, indeed, she might have done something;\r\nbut she was not like other titled mothers. In such a step as this she\r\nwas absolutely without the means.\r\n\r\nThus talking together they remained closeted for a most\r\nunconscionable time. Clara had had her purpose to carry out, and to\r\nHerbert the moments had been too precious to cause him any regret as\r\nthey passed. But now at last a knock was heard at the door, and Lady\r\nDesmond, without waiting for an answer to it, entered the room. Clara\r\nimmediately started from her seat, not as though she were either\r\nguilty or tremulous, but with a brave resolve to go on with her\r\npurposed plan.\r\n\r\n"Mamma," she said, "it is fixed now; it cannot be altered now."\r\n\r\n"What is fixed, Clara?"\r\n\r\n"Herbert and I have renewed our engagement, and nothing must now\r\nbreak it, unless we die."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Fitzgerald, if this be true your conduct to my daughter has been\r\nunmanly as well as ungenerous."\r\n\r\n"Lady Desmond, it is true; and I think that my conduct is neither\r\nunmanly nor ungenerous."\r\n\r\n"Your own relations are against you, sir."\r\n\r\n"What relations?" asked Clara, sharply.\r\n\r\n"I am not speaking to you, Clara; your absurdity and romance are so\r\ngreat that I cannot speak to you."\r\n\r\n"What relations, Herbert?" again asked Clara; for she would not for\r\nthe world have had Lady Fitzgerald against her.\r\n\r\n"Lady Desmond has, I believe, seen my Aunt Letty two or three times\r\nlately; I suppose she must mean her."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Clara, turning away as though she were now satisfied. And\r\nthen Herbert, escaping from the house as quickly as he could, rode\r\nhome with a renewal of that feeling of triumph which he had once\r\nenjoyed before when returning from Desmond Court to Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Herbert started for London. The parting was sad\r\nenough, and the occasion of it was such that it could hardly be\r\notherwise. "I am quite sure of one thing," he said to his sister\r\nEmmeline, "I shall never see Castle Richmond again." And, indeed,\r\none may say that small as might be his chance of doing so, his wish\r\nto do so must be still less. There could be no possible inducement\r\nto him to come back to a place which had so nearly been his own,\r\nand the possession of which he had lost in so painful a manner.\r\nEvery tree about the place, every path across the wide park, every\r\nhedge and ditch and hidden leafy corner, had had for him a special\r\ninterest,--for they had all been his own. But all that was now over.\r\nThey were not only not his own, but they belonged to one who was\r\nmounting into his seat of power over his head.\r\n\r\nHe had spent the long evening before his last dinner in going round\r\nthe whole demesne alone, so that no eye should witness what he felt.\r\nNone but those who have known the charms of a country-house early in\r\nlife can conceive the intimacy to which a man attains with all the\r\nvarious trifling objects round his own locality; how he knows the\r\nbark of every tree, and the bend of every bough; how he has marked\r\nwhere the rich grass grows in tufts, and where the poorer soil is\r\nalways dry and bare; how he watches the nests of the rooks, and the\r\nholes of the rabbits, and has learned where the thrushes build, and\r\ncan show the branch on which the linnet sits. All these things had\r\nbeen dear to Herbert, and they all required at his hand some last\r\nfarewell. Every dog, too, he had to see, and to lay his hand on\r\nthe neck of every horse. This making of his final adieu under such\r\ncircumstances was melancholy enough.\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, later in the evening, after dinner, all the servants\r\nwere called into the parlour that he might shake hands with them.\r\nThere was not one of them who had not hoped, as lately as three\r\nmonths since, that he or she would live to call Herbert Fitzgerald\r\nmaster. Indeed, he had already been their master--their young master.\r\nAll Irish servants especially love to pay respect to the "young\r\nmasther;" but Herbert now was to be their master no longer, and the\r\nprobability was that he would never see one of them again.\r\n\r\nHe schooled himself to go through the ordeal with a manly gait and\r\nwith dry eyes, and he did it; but their eyes were not dry, not even\r\nthose of the men. Mrs. Jones and a favourite girl whom the young\r\nladies patronized were not of the number, for it had been decided\r\nthat they should follow the fortunes of their mistress; but Richard\r\nwas there, standing a little apart from the others, as being now on a\r\ndifferent footing. He was to go also, but before the scene was over\r\nhe also had taken to sobbing violently.\r\n\r\n"I wish you all well and happy," said Herbert, making his little\r\nspeech, "and regret deeply that the intercourse between us should be\r\nthus suddenly severed. You have served me and mine well and truly,\r\nand it is hard upon you now, that you should be bid to go and seek\r\nanother home elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that we mind, Mr. Herbert; it ain\'t that as frets us," said\r\none of the men.\r\n\r\n"It ain\'t that at all, at all," said Richard, doing chorus; "but that\r\nyer honour should be robbed of what is yer honour\'s own."\r\n\r\n"But you all know that we cannot help it," continued Herbert; "a\r\nmisfortune has come upon us which nobody could have foreseen, and\r\ntherefore we are obliged to part with our old friends and servants."\r\n\r\nAt the word friends the maid-servants all sobbed. "And \'deed we is\r\nyour frinds, and true frinds, too," wailed the cook.\r\n\r\n"I know you are, and it grieves me to feel that I shall see you no\r\nmore. But you must not be led to think by what Richard says that\r\nanybody is depriving me of that which ought to be my own. I am now\r\nleaving Castle Richmond because it is not my own, but justly belongs\r\nto another;--to another who, I must in justice tell you, is in no\r\nhurry to claim his inheritance. We none of us have any ground for\r\ndispleasure against the present owner of this place, my cousin, Sir\r\nOwen Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"We don\'t know nothing about Sir Owen," said one voice.\r\n\r\n"And don\'t want," said another, convulsed with sobs.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a very good sort of young gentleman--of his own kind, no\r\ndoubt," said Richard.\r\n\r\n"But you can all of you understand," continued Herbert, "that as this\r\nplace is no longer our own, we are obliged to leave it; and as we\r\nshall live in a very different way in the home to which we are going,\r\nwe are obliged to part with you, though we have no reason to find\r\nfault with any one among you. I am going to-morrow morning early, and\r\nmy mother and sisters will follow after me in a few weeks. It will be\r\na sad thing too for them to say good-bye to you all, as it is for me\r\nnow; but it cannot be helped. God bless you all, and I hope that you\r\nwill find good masters and kind mistresses, with whom you may live\r\ncomfortably, as I hope you have done here."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t find no other mistresses like her leddyship," sobbed out\r\nthe senior housemaid.\r\n\r\n"There ain\'t niver such a one in the county Cork," said the cook; "in\r\na week of Sundays you wouldn\'t hear the breath out of her above her\r\nown swait nathural voice."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve driv\' her since iver--" began Richard; but he was going to say\r\nsince ever she was married, but he remembered that this allusion\r\nwould be unbecoming, so he turned his face to the door-post, and\r\nbegan to wail bitterly.\r\n\r\nAnd then Herbert shook hands with them all, and it was pretty to see\r\nhow the girls wiped their hands in their aprons before they gave them\r\nto him, and how they afterwards left the room with their aprons up to\r\ntheir faces. The women walked out first, and then the men, hanging\r\ndown their heads, and muttering as they went, each some little prayer\r\nthat fortune and prosperity might return to the house of Fitzgerald.\r\nThe property might go, but according to their views Herbert was\r\nalways, and always would be, the head of the house. And then, last of\r\nall, Richard went. "There ain\'t one of \'em, Mr. Herbert, as wouldn\'t\r\nguv his fist to go wid yer, and think nothing about the wages."\r\n\r\nHe was to start very early, and his packing was all completed that\r\nnight. "I do so wish we were going with you," said Emmeline, sitting\r\nin his room on the top of a corded box, which was to follow him by\r\nsome slower conveyance.\r\n\r\n"And I do so wish I was staying with you," said he.\r\n\r\n"What is the good of staying here now?" said she; "what pleasure can\r\nthere be in it? I hardly dare to go outside the house door for fear I\r\nshould be seen."\r\n\r\n"But why? We have done nothing that we need be ashamed of."\r\n\r\n"No; I know that. But, Herbert, do you not find that the pity of the\r\npeople is hard to bear? It is written in their eyes, and meets one at\r\nevery turn."\r\n\r\n"We shall get rid of that very soon. In a few months we shall be\r\nclean forgotten."\r\n\r\n"I do not know about being forgotten."\r\n\r\n"You will be as clean forgotten,--as though you had never existed.\r\nAnd all these servants who are now so fond of us, in three months\'\r\ntime will be just as fond of Owen Fitzgerald, if he will let them\r\nstay here; it\'s the way of the world."\r\n\r\nThat Herbert should have indulged in a little morbid misanthropy on\r\nsuch an occasion was not surprising. But I take leave to think that\r\nhe was wrong in his philosophy; we do make new friends when we lose\r\nour old friends, and the heart is capable of cure as is the body;\r\nwere it not so, how terrible would be our fate in this world! But we\r\nare so apt to find fault with God\'s goodness to us in this respect,\r\narguing, of others if not of ourselves, that the heart once widowed\r\nshould remain a widow through all time. I, for one, think that the\r\nheart should receive its new spouses with what alacrity it may, and\r\nalways with thankfulness.\r\n\r\n"I suppose Lady Desmond will let us see Clara," said Emmeline.\r\n\r\n"Of course you must see her. If you knew how much she talks about\r\nyou, you would not think of leaving Ireland without seeing her."\r\n\r\n"Dear Clara! I am sure she does not love me better than I do her. But\r\nsuppose that Lady Desmond won\'t let us see her! and I know that it\r\nwill be so. That grave old man with the bald head will come out and\r\nsay that \'the Lady Clara is not at home,\' and then we shall have to\r\nleave without seeing her. But it does not matter with her as it might\r\nwith others, for I know that her heart will be with us."\r\n\r\n"If you write beforehand to say that you are coming, and explain that\r\nyou are doing so to say good-bye, then I think they will admit you."\r\n\r\n"Yes; and the countess would take care to be there, so that I could\r\nnot say one word to Clara about you. Oh, Herbert! I would give\r\nanything if I could have her here for one day,--only for one day."\r\nBut when they talked it over they both of them decided that this\r\nwould not be practicable. Clara could not stay away from her own\r\nhouse without her mother\'s leave, and it was not probable that her\r\nmother would give her permission to stay at Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nHERBERT FITZGERALD IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the whole household was up and dressed very\r\nearly. Lady Fitzgerald--the poor lady made many futile attempts to\r\ndrop her title, but hitherto without any shadow of success--Lady\r\nFitzgerald was down in the breakfast parlour at seven, as also were\r\nAunt Letty, and Mary, and Emmeline. Herbert had begged his mother\r\nnot to allow herself to be disturbed, alleging that there was no\r\ncause, seeing that they all so soon would meet in London; but she\r\nwas determined that she would superintend his last meal at Castle\r\nRichmond. The servants brought in the trays with melancholy silence,\r\nand now that the absolute moment of parting had come the girls could\r\nnot speak lest the tears should come and choke them. It was not that\r\nthey were about to part with him; that parting would only be for a\r\nmonth. But he was now about to part from all that ought to have been\r\nhis own. He sat down at the table in his accustomed place, with a\r\nforced smile on his face, but without a word, and his sisters put\r\nbefore him his cup of tea, and the slice of ham that had been cut for\r\nhim, and his portion of bread. That he was making an effort they all\r\nsaw. He bowed his head down over the tea to sip it and took the knife\r\nin his hand, and then he looked up at them, for he knew that their\r\neyes were on him; he looked up at them to show that he could still\r\nendure it. But, alas! he could not endure it. The struggle was too\r\nmuch for him; he pushed his plate violently from him into the middle\r\nof the table, and dropping his head upon his hands he burst forth\r\ninto audible lamentations.\r\n\r\nOh, my friends! be not hard on him in that he was thus weeping like a\r\nwoman. It was not for his lost wealth that he was wailing, nor even\r\nfor the name or splendour that could be no longer his; nor was it\r\nfor his father\'s memory, though he had truly loved his father; nor\r\nfor his mother\'s sorrow, or the tragedy of her life\'s history. For\r\nnone of these things were his tears flowing and his sobs coming so\r\nviolently that it nearly choked him to repress them. Nor could he\r\nhimself have said why he was weeping.\r\n\r\nIt was the hundred small things from which he was parting for ever\r\nthat thus disturbed him. The chair on which he sat, the carpet on\r\nthe floor, the table on which he leaned, the dull old picture of his\r\ngreat-grandfather over the fireplace,--they were all his old familiar\r\nfriends, they were all part of Castle Richmond,--of that Castle\r\nRichmond which he might never be allowed to see again.\r\n\r\nHis mother and sisters came to him, hanging over him, and they joined\r\ntheir tears together. "Do not tell her that I was like this," said he\r\nat last.\r\n\r\n"She will love you the better for it if she has a true woman\'s heart\r\nwithin her breast," said his mother.\r\n\r\n"As true a heart as ever breathed," said Emmeline through her sobs.\r\n\r\nAnd then they pressed him to eat, but it was in vain. He knew that\r\nthe food would choke him if he attempted it. So he gulped down the\r\ncup of tea, and with one kiss to his mother he rushed from them,\r\nrefusing Aunt Letty\'s proffered embrace, passing through the line of\r\nservants without another word to one of them, and burying himself\r\nin the post-chaise which was to carry him the first stage on his\r\nmelancholy journey.\r\n\r\nIt was a melancholy journey all through. From the time that he\r\nleft the door at Castle Richmond that was no longer his own, till\r\nhe reached the Euston Station in London, he spoke no word to any\r\none more than was absolutely necessary for the purposes of his\r\ntravelling. Nothing could be more sad than the prospect of his\r\nresidence in London. Not that he was without friends there, for he\r\nbelonged to a fashionable club to which he could still adhere if it\r\nso pleased him, and had all his old Oxford comrades to fall back upon\r\nif that were of any service to him. But how is a man to walk into his\r\nclub who yesterday was known as his father\'s eldest son and the heir\r\nto a baronetcy and twelve thousand a year, and who to-day is known\r\nas nobody\'s son and the heir to nothing? Men would feel so much\r\nfor him and pity him so deeply! That was the worst feature of his\r\npresent position. He could hardly dare to show himself more than was\r\nabsolutely necessary till the newness of his tragedy was worn off.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast had taken lodgings for him, in which he was to remain\r\ntill he could settle himself in the same house with his mother. And\r\nthis house, in which they were all to live, had also been taken,--up\r\nin that cheerful locality near Harrow-on-the-Hill, called St. John\'s\r\nWood Road, the cab fares to which from any central part of London are\r\nso very ruinous. But that house was not yet ready, and so he went\r\ninto lodgings in Lincoln\'s Inn Fields. Mr. Prendergast had chosen\r\nthis locality because it was near the chambers of that great Chancery\r\nbarrister, Mr. Die, under whose beneficent wing Herbert Fitzgerald\r\nwas destined to learn all the mysteries of the Chancery bar. The\r\nsanctuary of Mr. Die\'s wig was in Stone Buildings, immediately close\r\nto that milky way of vice-chancellors, whose separate courts cluster\r\nabout the old chapel of Lincoln\'s Inn; and here was Herbert to sit,\r\nstudious, for the next three years,--to sit there instead of at the\r\nvarious relief committees in the vicinity of Kanturk. And why could\r\nhe not be as happy at the one as at the other? Would not Mr. Die be\r\nas amusing as Mr. Townsend; and the arguments of Vice-Chancellor\r\nStuart\'s court quite as instructive as those heard in the committee\r\nroom at Gortnaclough?\r\n\r\nOn the morning of his arrival in London he drove to his lodgings, and\r\nfound a note there from Mr. Prendergast asking him to dinner on that\r\nday, and promising to take him to Mr. Die on the following morning.\r\nMr. Prendergast kept a bachelor\'s house in Bloomsbury Square, not\r\nvery far from Lincoln\'s Inn--just across Holborn, as all Londoners\r\nknow; and there he would expect Herbert at seven o\'clock. "I will\r\nnot ask any one to meet you," he said, "because you will be tired\r\nafter your journey, and perhaps more inclined to talk to me than to\r\nstrangers."\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast was one of those old-fashioned people who think that\r\na spacious substantial house in Bloomsbury Square, at a rent of a\r\nhundred and twenty pounds a year, is better worth having than a\r\nnarrow, lath and plaster, ill-built tenement at nearly double the\r\nprice out westward of the Parks. A quite new man is necessarily\r\nafraid of such a locality as Bloomsbury Square, for he has no chance\r\nof getting any one into his house if he do not live westward. Who\r\nwould dine with Mr. Jones in Woburn Terrace, unless he had known\r\nMr. Jones all his days, or unless Jones were known as a top sawyer\r\nin some walk of life? But Mr. Prendergast was well enough known\r\nto his old friends to be allowed to live where he pleased, and he\r\nwas not very anxious to add to their number by any new fashionable\r\nallurements.\r\n\r\nHerbert sent over to Bloomsbury Square to say that he would be there\r\nat seven o\'clock, and then sat himself down in his new lodgings. It\r\nwas but a dingy abode, consisting of a narrow sitting-room looking\r\nout into the big square from over a covered archway, and a narrower\r\nbedroom looking backwards into a dull, dirty-looking, crooked street.\r\nNothing, he thought, could be more melancholy than such a home. But\r\nthen what did it signify? His days would be passed in Mr. Die\'s\r\nchambers, and his evenings would be spent over his law books with\r\nclosed windows and copious burnings of the midnight oil. For Herbert\r\nhad wisely resolved that hard work, and hard work alone, could\r\nmitigate the misery of his present position.\r\n\r\nBut he had no work for the present day. He could not at once unpack\r\nhis portmanteau and begin his law studies on the moment. It was about\r\nnoon when he had completed the former preparation, and eaten such\r\nbreakfast as his new London landlady had gotten for him. And the\r\nbreakfast had not of itself been bad, for Mrs. Whereas had been a\r\ndaughter of Themis all her life, waiting upon scions of the law since\r\nfirst she had been able to run for a penn\'orth of milk. She had been\r\nlaundress on a stairs for ten years, having married a law stationer\'s\r\napprentice, and now she owned the dingy house over the covered way,\r\nand let her own lodgings with her own furniture; nor was she often\r\nwithout friends who would recommend her zeal and honesty, and make\r\nexcuse for the imperiousness of her ways and the too great fluency of\r\nher by no means servile tongue.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs.--," said Herbert. "I beg your pardon, but might I ask your\r\nname?"\r\n\r\n"No offence, sir; none in life. My name\'s Whereas. Martha Whereas,\r\nand \'as been now for five-and-twenty year. There be\'ant many of the\r\ngen\'lemen about the courts here as don\'t know some\'at of me. And I\r\nknew some\'at of them too, before they carried their wigs so grandly.\r\nMy husband, that\'s Whereas,--you\'ll all\'ays find him at the little\r\nstationer\'s shop outside the gate in Carey Street. You\'ll know him\r\nsome of these days, I\'ll go bail, if you\'re going to Mr. Die; anyways\r\nyou\'ll know his handwrite. Tea to your liking, sir? I all\'ays gets\r\ncream for gentlemen, sir, unless they tells me not. Milk a \'alfpenny,\r\nsir; cream tuppence; three \'alfpence difference; hain\'t it, sir? So\r\nnow you can do as you pleases, and if you like bacon and heggs to\r\nyour breakfastesses you\'ve only to say the words. But then the heggs\r\nhain\'t heggs, that\'s the truth; and they hain\'t chickens, but some\'at\r\nbetwixt the two."\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on during the whole time that he was eating, moving\r\nabout from place to place, and putting back into the places which\r\nshe had chosen for them anything which he had chanced to move; now\r\ndusting a bit of furniture with her apron, and then leaning on the\r\nback of a chair while she asked him some question as to his habits\r\nand future mode of living. She also wore a bonnet, apparently as\r\na customary part of her house costume, and Herbert could not help\r\nthinking that she looked very like his Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\nBut when she had gone and taken the breakfast things with her, then\r\nbegan the tedium of the day. It seemed to him as though he had no\r\nmeans of commencing his life in London until he had been with Mr.\r\nPrendergast or Mr. Die. And so new did it all feel to him, so strange\r\nand wonderful, that he hardly dared to go out of the house by himself\r\nand wander about the premises of the Inn. He was not absolutely a\r\nstranger in London, for he had been elected at a club before he had\r\nleft Oxford, and had been up in town twice, staying on each occasion\r\nsome few weeks. Had he therefore been asked about the metropolis\r\nsome four months since at Castle Richmond, he would have professed\r\nthat he knew it well. Starting from Pall Mall he could have gone to\r\nany of the central theatres, or to the Parks, or to the houses of\r\nParliament, or to the picture galleries in June. But now in that\r\ndingy big square he felt himself to be absolutely a stranger; and\r\nwhen he did venture out he watched the corners, in order that he\r\nmight find his way back without asking questions.\r\n\r\nAnd then he roamed round the squares and about the little courts, and\r\nfound out where were Stone Buildings,--so called because they are\r\nso dull and dead and stony-hearted: and as his courage increased he\r\nmade his way into one of the courts, and stood up for a while on an\r\nuncomfortable narrow step, so that he might watch the proceedings as\r\nthey went on, and it all seemed to him to be dull and deadly. There\r\nwas no life and amusement such as he had seen at the Assize Court in\r\ncounty Cork, when he was sworn in as one of the Grand Jury. There\r\nthe gentlemen in wigs--for on the Munster circuit they do wear wigs,\r\nor at any rate did then--laughed and winked and talked together\r\njoyously; and when a Roman Catholic fisherman from Berehaven was\r\nput into the dock for destroying the boat and nets of a Protestant\r\nfisherman from Dingle in county Kerry, who had chanced to come that\r\nway, "not fishing at all, at all, yer honour, but just souping," as\r\nthe Papist prisoner averred with great emphasis, the gentlemen of\r\nthe robe had gone to the fight with all the animation and courage\r\nof Matadors and Picadors in a bull-ring. It was delightful to see\r\nthe way in which Roman Catholic skill combated Protestant fury,\r\nwith a substratum below of Irish fun which showed to everybody that\r\nit was not all quite in earnest;--that the great O\'Fagan and the\r\ngreat Fitzberesford could sit down together afterwards with all the\r\npleasure in life over their modicum of claret in the barristers\' room\r\nat the Imperial hotel. And then the judge had added to the life of\r\nthe meeting, helping to bamboozle and make miserable a wretch of a\r\nwitness who had been caught in the act of seeing the boat smashed\r\nwith a fragment of rock, and was now, in consequence, being impaled\r\nalive by his lordship\'s assistance.\r\n\r\n"What do you say your name is?" demanded his lordship, angrily.\r\n\r\n"Rowland Houghton," said the miserable stray Saxon tourist who had so\r\nunfortunately strayed that way on the occasion.\r\n\r\n"What?" repeated the judge, whose ears were sharper to such sounds as\r\nO\'Shaughnessy, Macgillycuddy, and O\'Callaghan.\r\n\r\n"Rowland Houghton," said the offender, in his distress; quicker,\r\nlouder, and perhaps not more distinctly than before.\r\n\r\n"What does the man say?" said the judge, turning his head down\r\ntowards a satellite who sat on a bench beneath his cushion.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman appealed to pronounced the name for the judge\'s hearing\r\nwith a full rolling Irish brogue, that gave great delight through all\r\nthe court; "R-rowland Hough-h-ton, me lor-r-d."\r\n\r\nWhereupon his lordship threw up his hands in dismay. "Oulan Outan!"\r\nsaid he. "Oulan Outan! I never heard such a name in my life!" And\r\nthen, having thoroughly impaled the wicked witness, and added\r\nmaterially to the amusement of the day, the judge wrote down the\r\nname in his book; and there it is to this day, no doubt, Oulan Outan.\r\nAnd when one thinks of it, it was monstrous that an English witness\r\nshould go into an Irish law court with such a name as Rowland\r\nHoughton.\r\n\r\nBut here, in the dark dingy court to which Herbert had penetrated\r\nin Lincoln\'s Inn, there was no such life as this. Here, whatever\r\nskill there might be, was of a dark subterranean nature, quite\r\nunintelligible to any minds but those of experts; and as for fury or\r\nfun, there was no spark either of one or of the other. The judge sat\r\nback in his seat, a tall, handsome, speechless man, not asleep, for\r\nhis eye from time to time moved slowly from the dingy barrister who\r\nwas on his legs to another dingy barrister who was sitting with his\r\nhands in his pockets, and with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling. The\r\ngentleman who was in the act of pleading had a huge open paper in\r\nhis hand, from which he droned forth certain legal quiddities of the\r\ndullest and most uninteresting nature. He was in earnest, for there\r\nwas a perpetual energy in his drone, as a droning bee might drone who\r\nwas known to drone louder than other drones. But it was a continuous\r\nenergy supported by perseverance, and not by impulse; and seemed to\r\ncome of a fixed determination to continue the reading of that paper\r\ntill all the world should be asleep. A great part of the world around\r\nwas asleep; but the judge\'s eye was still open, and one might say\r\nthat the barrister was resolved to go on till that eye should have\r\nbecome closed in token of his success.\r\n\r\nHerbert remained there for an hour, thinking that he might learn\r\nsomething that would be serviceable to him in his coming legal\r\ncareer; but at the end of the hour the same thing was going on,--the\r\njudge\'s eye was still open, and the lawyer\'s drone was still\r\nsounding; and so he came away, having found himself absolutely dozing\r\nin the uncomfortable position in which he was standing.\r\n\r\nAt last the day wore away, and at seven o\'clock he found himself in\r\nMr. Prendergast\'s hall in Bloomsbury Square; and his hat and umbrella\r\nwere taken away from him by an old servant looking very much like Mr.\r\nPrendergast himself;--having about him the same look of the stiffness\r\nof years, and the same look also of excellent preservation and care.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Prendergast is in the library, sir, if you please," said the old\r\nservant; and so saying he ushered Herbert into the back down-stairs\r\nroom. It was a spacious, lofty apartment, well fitted up for a\r\nlibrary, and furnished for that purpose with exceeding care;--such a\r\nroom as one does not find in the flashy new houses in the west, where\r\nthe dining-room and drawing-room occupy all of the house that is\r\nvisible. But then, how few of those who live in flashy new houses in\r\nthe west require to have libraries in London!\r\n\r\nAs he entered the room Mr. Prendergast came forward to meet him,\r\nand seemed heartily glad to see him. There was a cordiality about\r\nhim which Herbert had never recognized at Castle Richmond, and an\r\nappearance of enjoyment which had seemed to be almost foreign to the\r\nlawyer\'s nature. Herbert perhaps had not calculated, as he should\r\nhave done, that Mr. Prendergast\'s mission in Ireland had not admitted\r\nof much enjoyment. Mr. Prendergast had gone there to do a job of\r\nwork, and that he had done, very thoroughly; but he certainly had not\r\nenjoyed himself.\r\n\r\nThere was time for only few words before the old man again entered\r\nthe room, announcing dinner; and those few words had no reference\r\nwhatever to the Castle Richmond sorrow. He had spoken of Herbert\'s\r\nlodging, and of his journey, and a word or two of Mr. Die, and then\r\nthey went in to dinner. And at dinner too the conversation wholly\r\nturned upon indifferent matters, upon reform at Oxford, the state\r\nof parties, and of the peculiar idiosyncrasies of the Irish Low\r\nChurch clergymen, on all of which subjects Herbert found that Mr.\r\nPrendergast had a tolerably strong opinion of his own. The dinner was\r\nvery good, though by no means showy,--as might have been expected in\r\na house in Bloomsbury Square--and the wine excellent, as might have\r\nbeen expected in any house inhabited by Mr. Prendergast.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the dinner was over, and the old servant had slowly\r\nremoved his last tray, when they had each got into an arm-chair,\r\nand were seated at properly comfortable distances from the fire, Mr.\r\nPrendergast began to talk freely; not that he at once plunged into\r\nthe middle of the old history, or began with lugubrious force to\r\nrecapitulate the horrors that were now partly over; but gradually he\r\nveered round to those points as to which he thought it good that he\r\nshould speak before setting Herbert at work on his new London life.\r\n\r\n"You drink claret, I suppose?" said Mr. Prendergast, as he adjusted a\r\nportion of the table for their evening symposium.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Herbert, not caring very much at that moment what the\r\nwine was.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find that pretty good; a good deal better than what you\'ll\r\nget in most houses in London nowadays. But you know a man always\r\nlikes his own wine, and especially an old man."\r\n\r\nHerbert said something about it being very good, but did not give\r\nthat attention to the matter which Mr. Prendergast thought that\r\nit deserved. Indeed, he was thinking more about Mr. Die and Stone\r\nBuildings than about the wine.\r\n\r\n"And how do you find my old friend Mrs. Whereas?" asked the lawyer.\r\n\r\n"She seems to be a very attentive sort of woman."\r\n\r\n"Yes; rather too much so sometimes. People do say that she never\r\nknows how to hold her tongue. But she won\'t rob you, nor yet poison\r\nyou; and in these days that is saying a very great deal for a woman\r\nin London." And then there was a pause, as Mr. Prendergast sipped his\r\nwine with slow complacency. "And we are to go to Mr. Die to-morrow, I\r\nsuppose?" he said, beginning again. To which Herbert replied that he\r\nwould be ready at any time in the morning that might be suitable.\r\n\r\n"The sooner you get into harness the better. It is not only that you\r\nhave much to learn, but you have much to forget also."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Herbert, "I have much to forget indeed; more than I can\r\nforget, I\'m afraid, Mr. Prendergast."\r\n\r\n"There is, I fancy, no sorrow which a man cannot forget; that is,\r\nas far as the memory of it is likely to be painful to him. You\r\nwill not absolutely cease to remember Castle Richmond and all its\r\ncircumstances; you will still think of the place and all the people\r\nwhom you knew there; but you will learn to do so without the pain\r\nwhich of course you now suffer. That is what I mean by forgetting."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t complain, sir."\r\n\r\n"No, I know you don\'t; and that is the reason why I am so anxious\r\nto see you happy. You have borne the whole matter so well that I am\r\nquite sure that you will be able to live happily in this new life.\r\nThat is what I mean when I say that you will forget Castle Richmond."\r\n\r\nHerbert bethought himself of Clara Desmond, and of the woman whom he\r\nhad seen in the cabin, and reflected that even at present he had no\r\nright to be unhappy.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have no thought of going back to Ireland?" said Mr.\r\nPrendergast.\r\n\r\n"Oh, none in the least."\r\n\r\n"On the whole I think you are right. No doubt a family connection is\r\na great assistance to a barrister, and there would be reasons which\r\nwould make attorneys in Ireland throw business into your hands at an\r\nearly period of your life. Your history would give you an _\xe9clat_\r\nthere, if you know what I mean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, perfectly; but I don\'t want that."\r\n\r\n"No. It is a kind of assistance which in my opinion a man should not\r\ndesire. In the first place, it does not last. A man so bouyed up is\r\napt to trust to such support, instead of his own steady exertions;\r\nand the firmest of friends won\'t stick to a lawyer long if he can get\r\nbetter law for his money elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"There should be no friendship in such matters, I think."\r\n\r\n"Well, I won\'t say that. But the friendship should come of the\r\nservice, not the service of the friendship. Good, hard, steady, and\r\nenduring work,--work that does not demand immediate acknowledgment\r\nand reward, but that can afford to look forward for its results,--it\r\nis that, and that only which in my opinion will insure to a man\r\npermanent success."\r\n\r\n"It is hard though for a poor man to work so many years without an\r\nincome," said Herbert, thinking of Lady Clara Desmond.\r\n\r\n"Not hard if you get the price of your work at last. But you can\r\nhave your choice. A moderate fixed income can now be had by any\r\nbarrister early in life,--by any barrister of fair parts and sound\r\nacquirements. There are more barristers now filling salaried places\r\nthan practising in the courts."\r\n\r\n"But those places are given by favour."\r\n\r\n"No; not so generally,--or if by favour, by that sort of favour which\r\nis as likely to come to you as to another. Such places are not given\r\nto incompetent young men because their fathers and mothers ask for\r\nthem. But won\'t you fill your glass?"\r\n\r\n"I am doing very well, thank you."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll do better if you\'ll fill your glass, and let me have the\r\nbottle back. But you are thinking of the good old historical days\r\nwhen you talk of barristers having to wait for their incomes.\r\nThere has been a great change in that respect,--for the better, as\r\nyou of course will think. Now-a-days a man is taken away from his\r\nboat-racing and his skittle-ground to be made a judge. A little law\r\nand a great fund of physical strength--that is the extent of the\r\ndemand." And Mr. Prendergast plainly showed by the tone of his voice\r\nthat he did not admire the wisdom of this new policy of which he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n"But I suppose a man must work five years before he can earn\r\nanything," said Herbert, still despondingly; for five years is a long\r\ntime to an expectant lover.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen years of unpaid labour used not to be thought too great a\r\nprice to pay for ultimate success," said Mr. Prendergast, almost\r\nsighing at the degeneracy of the age. "But men in those days were\r\nambitious and patient."\r\n\r\n"And now they are ambitious and impatient," suggested Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Covetous and impatient might perhaps be the truer epithets," said\r\nMr. Prendergast with grim sarcasm.\r\n\r\nIt is sad for a man to feel, when he knows that he is fast going down\r\nthe hill of life, that the experience of old age is to be no longer\r\nvalued nor its wisdom appreciated. The elderly man of this day thinks\r\nthat he has been robbed of his chance in life. When he was in his\r\nfull physical vigour he was not old enough for mental success. He was\r\nstill winning his spurs at forty. But at fifty--so does the world\r\nchange--he learns that he is past his work. By some unconscious and\r\nunlucky leap he has passed from the unripeness of youth to the decay\r\nof age, without even knowing what it was to be in his prime. A man\r\nshould always seize his opportunity; but the changes of the times in\r\nwhich he has lived have never allowed him to have one. There has been\r\nno period of flood in his tide which might lead him on to fortune.\r\nWhile he has been waiting patiently for high water the ebb has come\r\nupon him. Mr. Prendergast himself had been a successful man, and his\r\nregrets, therefore, were philosophical rather than practical. As for\r\nHerbert, he did not look upon the question at all in the same light\r\nas his elderly friend, and on the whole was rather exhilarated by\r\nthe tone of Mr. Prendergast\'s sarcasm. Perhaps Mr. Prendergast had\r\nintended that such should be its effect.\r\n\r\nThe long evening passed away cosily enough, leaving on Herbert\'s mind\r\nan impression that in choosing to be a barrister he had certainly\r\nchosen the noblest walk of life in which a man could earn his bread.\r\nMr. Prendergast did not promise him either fame or fortune, nor did\r\nhe speak by any means in high enthusiastic language; he said much of\r\nthe necessity of long hours, of tedious work, of Amaryllis left by\r\nherself in the shade, and of Ne\xe6ra\'s locks unheeded; but nevertheless\r\nhe spoke in a manner to arouse the ambition and satisfy the longings\r\nof the young man who listened to him. There were much wisdom in what\r\nhe did, and much benevolence also.\r\n\r\nAnd then at about eleven o\'clock, Herbert having sat out the second\r\nbottle of claret, betook himself to his bed at the lodgings over the\r\ncovered way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nHOW THE EARL WAS WON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not quite at first that the countess could explain to her son\r\nhow she now wished that Owen Fitzgerald might become her son-in-law.\r\nShe had been so steadfast in her opposition to Owen when the earl\r\nhad last spoken of the matter, and had said so much of the wickedly\r\ndissipated life which Owen was leading, that she feared to shock the\r\nboy. But by degrees she brought the matter round, speaking of Owen\'s\r\ngreat good fortune, pointing out how much better he was suited for\r\nriches than for poverty, insisting warmly on all his good qualities\r\nand high feelings, and then saying at last, as it were without\r\nthought, "Poor Clara! She has been unfortunate, for at one time she\r\nloved Owen Fitzgerald much better than she will ever love his cousin\r\nHerbert."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so, mother?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it. The truth is, Patrick, you do not understand your\r\nsister; and indeed it is hard to do so. I have also always had an\r\ninward fear that she had now engaged herself to a man whom she did\r\nnot love. Of course as things were then it was impossible that she\r\nshould marry Owen; and I was glad to break her off from that feeling.\r\nBut she never loved Herbert Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Why, she is determined to have him, even now."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes! That is where you do not understand her. Now, at this\r\nspecial moment, her heart is touched by his misfortune, and she\r\nthinks herself bound by her engagement to sacrifice herself with him.\r\nBut that is not love. She has never loved any one but Owen,--and who\r\ncan wonder at it? for he is a man made for a woman to love."\r\n\r\nThe earl said nothing for a while, but sat balancing himself on the\r\nback legs of his chair. And then, as though a new idea had struck\r\nhim, he exclaimed, "If I thought that, mother, I would find out what\r\nOwen thinks of it himself."\r\n\r\n"Poor Owen!" said the countess. "There is no doubt as to what he\r\nthinks;" and then she left the room, not wishing to carry the\r\nconversation any further.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, and without any further hint from his mother,\r\nhe betook himself along the banks of the river to Hap House. In his\r\ncourse thither he never let his horse put a foot upon the road, but\r\nkept low down upon the water meadows, leaping over all the fences,\r\nas he had so often done with the man whom he was now going to see.\r\nIt was here, among these banks, that he had received his earliest\r\nlessons in horsemanship, and they had all been given by Owen\r\nFitzgerald. It had been a thousand pities, he had thought, that Owen\r\nhad been so poor as to make it necessary for them all to discourage\r\nthat love affair with Clara. He would have been so delighted to\r\nwelcome Owen as his brother-in-law. And as he strode along over the\r\nground, and landed himself knowingly over the crabbed fences, he\r\nbegan to think how much pleasanter the country would be for him if he\r\nhad a downright good fellow and crack sportsman as his fast friend at\r\nCastle Richmond. Sir Owen Fitzgerald of Castle Richmond! He would be\r\nthe man to whom he would be delighted to give his sister Clara.\r\n\r\nAnd then he hopped in from one of Owen\'s fields into a small paddock\r\nat the back of Owen\'s house, and seeing one of the stable-boys about\r\nthe place, asked him if his master was at home.\r\n\r\n"Shure an\' he\'s here thin, yer honour;" and Lord Desmond could hear\r\nthe boy whispering, "It\'s the young lord hisself." In a moment Owen\r\nFitzgerald was standing by his horse\'s side. It was the first time\r\nthat Owen had seen one of the family since the news had been spread\r\nabroad concerning his right to the inheritance of Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"Desmond," said he, taking the lad\'s hand with one of his, and\r\nputting the other on the animal\'s neck, "this is very good of you. I\r\nam delighted to see you. I had heard that you were in the country."\r\n\r\n"Yes; I have been home for this week past. But things are all so at\r\nsixes and sevens among us all that a fellow can\'t go and do just what\r\nhe would like."\r\n\r\nOwen well understood what he meant. "Indeed they are at sixes and\r\nsevens; you may well say that. But get off your horse, old fellow,\r\nand come into the house. Why, what a lather of heat the mare\'s in."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t she? it\'s quite dreadful. That chap of ours has no more idea\r\nof condition than I have of--of--of--of an archbishop. I\'ve just\r\ntrotted along the fields, and put her over a ditch or two, and you\r\nsee the state she\'s in. It\'s a beastly shame."\r\n\r\n"I know of old what your trottings are, Desmond; and what a ditch\r\nor two means. You\'ve been at every bank between this and Banteer as\r\nthough you were going for a steeplechase plate."\r\n\r\n"Upon my honour, Owen--"\r\n\r\n"Look here, Patsey. Walk that mare up and down here, between this\r\ngate and that post, till the big sweat has all dried on her; and then\r\nstick to her with a whisp of straw till she\'s as soft as silk. Do you\r\nhear?"\r\n\r\nPatsey said that he did hear; and then Owen, throwing his arm over\r\nthe earl\'s shoulder, walked slowly towards the house.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell you how glad I am to see you, old boy," said Owen,\r\npressing his young friend with something almost like an embrace. "You\r\nwill hardly believe how long it is since I have seen a face that I\r\ncared to look at."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you?" said the young lord, wondering. He knew that\r\nFitzgerald had now become heir to a very large fortune, or rather the\r\npossessor of that fortune, and he could not understand why a man who\r\nhad been so popular while he was poor should be deserted now that he\r\nwas rich.\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, have I not. Things are all at sixes and sevens as you\r\nsay. Let me see. Donnellan was here when you last saw me; and I was\r\nsoon tired of him when things became serious."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder you were tired of him."\r\n\r\n"But, Desmond, how\'s your mother?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, she\'s very well. These are bad times for poor people like us,\r\nyou know."\r\n\r\n"And your sister?"\r\n\r\n"She\'s pretty well too, thank you." And then there was a pause.\r\n"You\'ve had a great change in your fortune since I saw you, have you\r\nnot?" said the earl, after a minute or two. And there it occurred to\r\nhim for the first time, that, having refused his sister to this man\r\nwhen he was poor, he had now come to offer her to him when he was\r\nrich. "Not that that was the reason," he said to himself. "But it was\r\nimpossible then, and now it would be so pleasant."\r\n\r\n"It is a sad history, is it not?" said Owen.\r\n\r\n"Very sad," said the earl, remembering, however, that he had ridden\r\nover there with his heart full of joy,--of joy occasioned by that\r\nvery catastrophe which now, following his friend\'s words like a\r\nparrot, he declared to be so very sad.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were in the dining-room in which Owen usually lived, and\r\nwere both standing on the rug, as two men always do stand when they\r\nfirst get into a room together. And it was clear to see that neither\r\nof them knew how to break at once into the sort of loving, genial\r\ntalk which each was longing to have with the other. It is so easy to\r\nspeak when one has little or nothing to say; but often so difficult\r\nwhen there is much that must be said: and the same paradox is equally\r\ntrue of writing.\r\n\r\nThen Owen walked away to the window, looking out among the shrubs\r\ninto which Aby Mollett had been precipitated, as though he could\r\ncollect his thoughts there; and in a moment or two the earl followed\r\nhim, and looked out also among the shrubs. "They killed a fox exactly\r\nthere the other day; didn\'t they?" asked the earl, indicating the\r\nspot by a nod of his head.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they did." And then there was another pause. "I\'ll tell you\r\nwhat it is, Desmond," Owen said at last, going back to the rug and\r\nspeaking with an effort. "As the people say, \'a sight of you is good\r\nfor sore eyes.\' There is a positive joy to me in seeing you. It is\r\nlike a cup of cold water when a man is thirsty. But I cannot put the\r\ndrink to my lips till I know on what terms we are to meet. When last\r\nwe saw each other, we were speaking of your sister; and now that we\r\nmeet again, we must again speak of her. Desmond, all my thoughts\r\nare of her; I dream of her at night, and find myself talking to her\r\nspirit when I wake in the morning. I have much else that I ought to\r\nthink of; but I go about thinking of nothing but of her. I am told\r\nthat she is engaged to my cousin Herbert. Nay, she has told me so\r\nherself, and I know that it is so. But if she becomes his wife--any\r\nman\'s wife but mine--I cannot live in this country."\r\n\r\nHe had not said one word of that state of things in his life\'s\r\nhistory of which the country side was so full. He had spoken of\r\nHerbert, but he had not alluded to Herbert\'s fall. He had spoken of\r\nsuch hope as he still might have with reference to Clara Desmond;\r\nbut he did not make the slightest reference to that change in his\r\nfortunes--in his fortunes, and in those of his rival--which might\r\nhave so strong a bias on those hopes, and which ought so to have\r\nin the minds of all worldly, prudent people. It was to speak of\r\nthis specially that Lord Desmond had come thither; and then, if\r\nopportunity should offer, to lead away the subject to that other one;\r\nbut now Owen had begun at the wrong end. If called upon to speak\r\nabout his sister at once, what could the brother say, except that she\r\nwas engaged to Herbert Fitzgerald?\r\n\r\n"Tell me this, Desmond, whom does your sister love?" said Owen,\r\nspeaking almost fiercely in his earnestness. "I know so much of you,\r\nat any rate, that whatever may be your feelings you will not lie to\r\nme,"--thereby communicating to the young lord an accusation, which he\r\nvery well understood, against the truth of the countess, his mother.\r\n\r\n"When I have spoken to her about this she declares that she is\r\nengaged to Herbert Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Engaged to him! yes, I know that; I do not doubt that. It has been\r\ndinned into my ears now for the last six months till it is impossible\r\nto doubt it. And she will marry him too, if no one interferes to\r\nprevent it. I do not doubt that either. But, Desmond, that is not the\r\nquestion that I have asked. She did love me; and then she was ordered\r\nby her mother to abandon that love, and to give her heart to another.\r\nThat in words she has been obedient, I know well; but what I doubt is\r\nthis,--that she has in truth been able so to chuck her heart about\r\nlike a shuttlecock. I can only say that I am not able to do it."\r\n\r\nHow was the earl to answer him? The very line of argument which\r\nOwen\'s mind was taking was exactly that which the young lord himself\r\ndesired to promote. He too was desirous that Clara should go back to\r\nher first love. He himself thought strongly that Owen was a man more\r\nfitted than Herbert for the worshipful adoration of such a girl as\r\nhis sister Clara. But then he, Desmond, had opposed the match while\r\nOwen was poor, and how was he to frame words by which he might\r\nencourage it now that Owen was rich?\r\n\r\n"I have been so little with her, that I hardly know," he said. "But,\r\nOwen--"\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"It is so difficult for me to talk to you about all this."\r\n\r\n"Is it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes. You know that I have always liked you--always. No chap was\r\never such a friend to me as you have been;" and he squeezed Owen\'s\r\narm with strong boyish love.\r\n\r\n"I know all about it," said Owen.\r\n\r\n"Well; then all that happened about Clara. I was young then, you\r\nknow,"--he was now sixteen--"and had not thought anything about it.\r\nThe idea of you and Clara falling in love had never occurred to me.\r\nBoys are so blind, you know. But when it did happen--you remember\r\nthat day, old fellow, when you and I met down at the gate?"\r\n\r\n"Remember it!" said Owen. He would remember it, as he thought, when\r\nhalf an eternity should have passed over his head.\r\n\r\n"And I told you then what I thought. I don\'t think I am a particular\r\nfellow myself about money and rank and that sort of thing. I am as\r\npoor as a church mouse, and so I shall always remain; and for myself\r\nI don\'t care about it. But for one\'s sister, Owen--you never had a\r\nsister, had you?"\r\n\r\n"Never," said Owen, hardly thinking of the question.\r\n\r\n"One is obliged to think of such things for her. We should all go to\r\nrack and ruin, the whole family of us, box and dice,--as indeed we\r\nhave pretty well already--if some of us did not begin to look about\r\nus. I don\'t suppose I shall ever marry and have a family. I couldn\'t\r\nafford it, you know. And in that case Clara\'s son would be Earl of\r\nDesmond; or if I died she would be Countess of Desmond in her own\r\nright." And the young lord looked the personification of family\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\n"I know all that," said Owen; "but you do not suppose that I was\r\nthinking of it?"\r\n\r\n"What; as regards yourself. No; I am sure you never did. But, looking\r\nto all that, it would never have done for her to marry a man as\r\npoor as you were. It is not a comfortable thing to be a very poor\r\nnobleman, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nOwen again remained silent. He wanted to talk the earl over into\r\nfavouring his views, but he wanted to do so as Owen of Hap House, not\r\nas Owen of Castle Richmond. He perceived at once from the tone of\r\nthe boy\'s voice, and even from his words, that there was no longer\r\nanything to be feared from the brother\'s opposition; and perceiving\r\nthis, he thought that the mother\'s opposition might now perhaps also\r\nbe removed. But it was quite manifest that this had come from what\r\nwas supposed to be his altered position. "A man as poor as you were,"\r\nLord Desmond had said, urging that though now the marriage might be\r\nwell enough, in those former days it would have been madness. The\r\nline of argument was very clear; but as Owen was as poor as ever, and\r\nintended to remain so, there was nothing in it to comfort him.\r\n\r\n"I cannot say that I, myself, have so much worldly wisdom as you\r\nhave," said he at last, with something like a sneer.\r\n\r\n"Ah, that is just what I knew you would say. You think that I am\r\ncoming to you now, and offering to make up matters between you and\r\nClara because you are rich!"\r\n\r\n"But can you make up matters between me and Clara?" said Owen,\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n"Well, I do not know. The countess seems to think it might be so."\r\n\r\nAnd then again Owen was silent, walking about the room with his hands\r\nbehind his back. Then after all the one thing of this world which\r\nhis eye regarded as desirable was within his reach. He had then been\r\nright in supposing that that face which had once looked up to his so\r\nfull of love had been a true reflex of the girl\'s heart,--that it\r\nhad indicated to him love which was not changeable. It was true that\r\nClara, having accepted a suitor at her mother\'s order, might now be\r\nallowed to come back to him! As he thought of this, he wondered at\r\nthe endurance and obedience of a woman\'s heart which could thus give\r\nup all that it held as sacred at the instance of another. But even\r\nthis, though it was but little flattering to Clara, by no means\r\nlessened the transport which he felt. He had had that pride in\r\nhimself, that he had never ceased to believe that she loved him.\r\nFull of that thought, of which he had not dared to speak, he had\r\ngone about, gloomily miserable since the news of her engagement with\r\nHerbert had reached him, and now he learned, as he thought with\r\ncertainty, that his belief had been well grounded. Through all that\r\nhad passed Clara Desmond did love him still!\r\n\r\nBut as to this overture of reconciliation that was now made to him;\r\nhow was he to accept it or reject it? It was made to him because he\r\nwas believed to be Sir Owen Fitzgerald of Castle Richmond, a baronet\r\nof twelve thousand a year, instead of a poor squire, whose wife\r\nwould have to look narrowly to the kitchen, in order that food in\r\nsufficiency might be forthcoming for the parlour. That he would\r\nbecome Sir Owen he thought probable; but that he would be Sir Owen of\r\nHap House and not of Castle Richmond he had firmly resolved. He had\r\nthought of this for long hours and hours together, and felt that he\r\ncould never again be happy were he to put his foot into that house\r\nas its owner. Every tenant would scorn him, every servant would hate\r\nhim, every neighbour would condemn him; but this would be as nothing\r\nto his hatred of himself, to his own scorn and his own condemnation.\r\nAnd yet how great was the temptation to him now! If he would consent\r\nto call himself master of Castle Richmond, Clara\'s hand might still\r\nbe his.\r\n\r\nSo he thought; but those who know Clara Desmond better than he did\r\nwill know how false were his hopes. She was hardly the girl to have\r\ngone back to a lover when he was rich, whom she had rejected when he\r\nwas poor.\r\n\r\n"Desmond," said he, "come here and sit down;" and both sat leaning on\r\nthe table together, with their arms touching. "I understand it all\r\nnow I think; and remember this, my boy, that whomever I may blame,\r\nI do not blame you; that you are true and honest I am sure; and,\r\nindeed, there is only one person whom I do blame." He did not say\r\nthat this one person was the countess, but the earl knew just as well\r\nas though he had been told.\r\n\r\n"I understand all this now," he repeated, "and before we go any\r\nfurther, I must tell you one thing; I shall never be owner of Castle\r\nRichmond."\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought it was all settled!" said the earl, looking up with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all is settled. To every bargain there must be two\r\nparties, and I have never yet become a party to the bargain which\r\nshall make me owner of Castle Richmond."\r\n\r\n"But is it not yours of right?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know what you call right."\r\n\r\n"Right of inheritance," said the earl, who, having succeeded to his\r\nown rank by the strength of the same right enduring through many\r\nages, looked upon it as the one substantial palladium of the country.\r\n\r\n"Look here, old fellow, and I\'ll tell you my views about this. Sir\r\nThomas Fitzgerald, when he married that poor lady who is still\r\nstaying at Castle Richmond, did so in the face of the world with the\r\nfull assurance that he made her his legal wife. Whether such a case\r\nas this ever occurred before I don\'t know, but I am sure of this that\r\nin the eye of God she is his widow. Herbert Fitzgerald was brought up\r\nas the heir to all that estate, and I cannot see that he can fairly\r\nbe robbed of that right because another man has been a villain.\r\nThe title he cannot have, I suppose, because the law won\'t give it\r\nhim; but the property can be made over to him, and as far as I am\r\nconcerned it shall be made over. No earthly consideration shall\r\ninduce me to put my hand upon it, for in doing so I should look upon\r\nmyself as a thief and a scoundrel."\r\n\r\n"And you mean then that Herbert will have it all, just the same as it\r\nwas before?"\r\n\r\n"Just the same as regards the estate."\r\n\r\n"Then why has he gone away?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot answer for him. I can only tell you what I shall do. I dare\r\nsay it may take months before it is all settled. But now, Desmond,\r\nyou know how I stand; I am Owen Fitzgerald of Hap House, now as I\r\nhave ever been, that and nothing more,--for as to the handle to my\r\nname it is not worth talking about."\r\n\r\nThey were still sitting at the table, and now they both sat silent,\r\nnot looking at each other, but with their eyes fixed on the wood.\r\nOwen had in his hand a pen, which he had taken from the mantelpiece,\r\nand unconsciously began to trace signs on the polished surface\r\nbefore him. The earl sat with his forehead leaning on his two hands,\r\nthinking what he was to say next. He felt that he himself loved the\r\nman better than ever; but when his mother should come to hear all\r\nthis, what would she say?\r\n\r\n"You know it all now, my boy," said Owen, looking up at last; and as\r\nhe did so there was an expression about his face to which the young\r\nearl thought that he had never seen the like. There was a gleam in\r\nhis eye which, though not of joy, was so bright; and a smile round\r\nhis mouth which was so sweet, though full of sadness! "How can she\r\nnot love him?" said he to himself, thinking of his sister. "And now,\r\nDesmond, go back to your mother and tell her all. She has sent you\r\nhere."\r\n\r\n"No, she did not send me," said the boy, stoutly,--almost angrily;\r\n"she does not even know that I have come."\r\n\r\n"Go back then to your sister."\r\n\r\n"Nor does she know it."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, go back to them, and tell them both what I have told\r\nyou; and tell them this also, that I, Owen Fitzgerald of Hap House,\r\nstill love her better than all that the world else can give me;\r\nindeed, there is nothing else that I do love,--except you, Desmond.\r\nBut tell them also that I am Owen of Hap House still--that and\r\nnothing more."\r\n\r\n"Owen," said the lad, looking up at him; and Fitzgerald as he glanced\r\ninto the boy\'s face could see that there was that arising within his\r\nbreast which almost prevented him from speaking.\r\n\r\n"And look, Desmond," continued Fitzgerald; "do not think that I shall\r\nblame you because you turn from me, or call you mercenary. Do you\r\ndo what you think right. What you said just now of your sister\'s--,\r\nwell, of the possibility of our marriage, you said under the idea\r\nthat I was a rich man. You now find that I am a poor man; and you may\r\nconsider that the words were never spoken."\r\n\r\n"Owen!" said the boy again; and now that which was before rising in\r\nhis breast had risen to his brow and cheeks, and was telling its tale\r\nplainly in his eyes. And then he rose from his chair, turning away\r\nhis face, and walking towards the window; but before he had gone two\r\nsteps he turned again, and throwing himself on Fitzgerald\'s breast,\r\nhe burst out into a passion of tears.\r\n\r\n"Come, old fellow, what is this? This will never do," said Owen. But\r\nhis own eyes were full of tears also, and he too was nearly past\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n"I know you will think--I am a boy and a--fool," said the earl,\r\nthrough his sobs, as soon as he could speak; "but I can\'t--help it."\r\n\r\n"I think you are the dearest, finest, best fellow that ever lived,"\r\nsaid Fitzgerald, pressing him with his arm.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll tell you what, Owen, you should have her to-morrow if it\r\nwere in my power, for, by heaven! there is not another man so worthy\r\nof a girl in all the world; and I\'ll tell her so; and I don\'t care\r\nwhat the countess says. And, Owen, come what come may, you shall\r\nalways have my word;" and then he stood apart, and rubbing his eyes\r\nwith his arm tried to look like a man who was giving this pledge from\r\nhis judgment, not from his impulse.\r\n\r\n"It all depends on this, Desmond; whom does she love? See her alone,\r\nDesmond, and talk softly to her, and find out that." This he said\r\nthoughtfully, for in his mind "love should still be lord of all."\r\n\r\n"By heavens! if I were her, I know whom I should love," said the\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n"I would not have her as a gift if she did not love me," said Owen,\r\nproudly; "but if she do, I have a right to claim her as my own."\r\n\r\nAnd then they parted, and the earl rode back home with a quieter pace\r\nthan that which had brought him there, and in a different mood. He\r\nhad pledged himself now to Owen,--not to Owen of Castle Richmond, but\r\nto Owen of Hap House--and he intended to redeem his pledge if it were\r\npossible. He had been so conquered by the nobleness of his friend,\r\nthat he had forgotten his solicitude for his family and his sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nA TALE OF A TURBOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have been Owen Fitzgerald\'s desire to disclaim the\r\ninheritance which chance had put in his way in absolute silence, had\r\nsuch a course been possible to him. And, indeed, not being very well\r\nconversant with matters of business, he had thought for a while that\r\nthis might be done--or at any rate something not far different from\r\nthis. To those who had hitherto spoken to him upon the subject, to\r\nMr. Prendergast, Mr. Somers, and his cousin, he had disclaimed the\r\ninheritance, and that he had thought would have sufficed. That Sir\r\nThomas should die so quickly after the discovery had not of course\r\nbeen expected by anybody; and much, therefore, had not been thought\r\nat the moment of these disclaimers;--neither at the moment, nor\r\nindeed afterwards, when Sir Thomas did die.\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Somers was prepared to admit that as the game had been\r\ngiven up,--as his branch of the Fitzgeralds, acting under the advice\r\nof their friend and lawyer, admitted that the property must go\r\nfrom them--even he, much as he contested within his own breast the\r\npropriety of Mr. Prendergast\'s decisions, was fain to admit now that\r\nit was Owen\'s business to walk in upon the property. Any words which\r\nhe may have spoken on the impulse of the moment were empty words.\r\nWhen a man becomes heir to twelve thousand a year, he does not give\r\nit up in a freak of benevolence. And, therefore, when Sir Thomas had\r\nbeen dead some four or five weeks, and when Herbert had gone away\r\nfrom the scene which was no longer one of interest to him, it was\r\nnecessary that something should be done.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two or three days of his life Sir Thomas had executed\r\na new will, in which he admitted that his son was not the heir to his\r\nestates, and so disposed of such moneys as it was in his power to\r\nleave as he would have done had Herbert been a younger son. Early in\r\nhis life he himself had added something to the property, some two or\r\nthree hundred a year, and this, also, he left of course to his own\r\nfamily. Such having been done, there would have been no opposition\r\nmade to Owen had he immediately claimed the inheritance; but as he\r\nmade no claim, and took no step whatever,--as he appeared neither by\r\nhimself, nor by letter, nor by lawyer, nor by agent,--as no rumour\r\never got about as to what he intended to do, Mr. Somers found it\r\nnecessary to write to him. This he did on the day of Herbert\'s\r\ndeparture, merely asking him, perhaps with scant courtesy, who was\r\nhis man of business, in order that he, Mr. Somers, as agent to the\r\nlate proprietor, might confer with him. With but scant courtesy,--for\r\nMr. Somers had made one visit to Hap House since the news had been\r\nknown, with some intention of ingratiating himself with the future\r\nheir; but his tenders had not been graciously received. Mr. Somers\r\nwas a proud man, and though his position in life depended on the\r\nincome he received from the Castle Richmond estate, he would not make\r\nany further overture. So his letter was somewhat of the shortest, and\r\nmerely contained the request above named.\r\n\r\nOwen\'s reply was sharp, immediate, and equally short, and was carried\r\nback by the messenger from Castle Richmond who had brought the\r\nletter, to which it was an answer. It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   Hap House, Thursday morning, two o\'clock.\r\n\r\n(There was no other date; and Owen probably was unaware that his\r\nletter being written at two P.M. was not written on Thursday\r\nmorning.)\r\n\r\n   Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n   I have got no lawyer, and no man of business; nor do I\r\n   mean to employ any if I can help it. I intend to make no\r\n   claim to Mr. Herbert Fitzgerald\'s property of Castle\r\n   Richmond; and if it be necessary that I should sign any\r\n   legal document making over to him any claim that I may\r\n   have, I am prepared to do so at any moment. As he has got\r\n   a lawyer, he can get this arranged, and I suppose Mr.\r\n   Prendergast had better do it.\r\n\r\n   I am, dear sir,\r\n   Your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n   OWEN FITZGERALD of Hap House.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with those four or five lines he thought it would be practicable\r\nfor him to close the whole affair.\r\n\r\nThis happened on the day of Herbert\'s departure, and on the day\r\npreceding Lord Desmond\'s visit to Hap House; so that on the occasion\r\nof that visit, Owen looked upon the deed as fully done. He had put\r\nit quite beyond his own power to recede now, even had he so wished.\r\nAnd then came the tidings to him,--true tidings as he thought,--that\r\nClara was still within his reach if only he were master of Castle\r\nRichmond. That this view of his position did for a moment shake him I\r\nwill not deny; but it was only for a moment: and then it was that he\r\nhad looked up at Clara\'s brother, and bade him go back to his mother\r\nand sister, and tell them that Owen of Hap House was Owen of Hap\r\nHouse still;--that and nothing more. Clara Desmond might be bought at\r\na price which would be too costly even for such a prize as her. It\r\nwas well for him that he so resolved, for at no price could she have\r\nbeen bought.\r\n\r\nMr. Somers, when he received that letter, was much inclined to doubt\r\nwhether or no it might not be well to take Owen at his word. After\r\nall, what just right had he to the estate? According to the eternal\r\nand unalterable laws of right and wrong ought it not to belong to\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald? Mr. Somers allowed his wish on this occasion\r\nto be father to many thoughts much at variance from that line of\r\nthinking which was customary to him as a man of business. In his\r\nordinary moods, law with him was law, and a legal claim a legal\r\nclaim. Had he been all his life agent to the Hap House property\r\ninstead of to that of Castle Richmond, a thought so romantic would\r\nnever have entered his head. He would have scouted a man as nearly a\r\nmaniac who should suggest to him that his client ought to surrender\r\nan undoubted inheritance of twelve thousand a year on a point of\r\nfeeling. He would have rejected it as a proposed crime, and talked\r\nmuch of the indefeasible rights of the coming heirs of the new heir.\r\nHe would have been as firm as a rock, and as trenchant as a sword in\r\ndefence of his patron\'s claims. But now, having in his hands that\r\nshort, pithy letter from Owen Fitzgerald, he could not but look at\r\nthe matter in a more Christian light. After all was not justice,\r\nimmutable justice, better than law? And would not the property be\r\nenough for both of them? Might not law and justice make a compromise?\r\nLet Owen be the baronet, and take a slice of four or five thousand,\r\nand add that to Hap House; and then if these things were well\r\narranged, might not Mr. Somers still be agent to them both?\r\n\r\nMeditating all this in his newly tuned romantic frame of mind Mr.\r\nSomers sat down and wrote a long letter to Mr. Prendergast, enclosing\r\nthe short letter from Owen, and saying all that he, as a man of\r\nbusiness with a new dash of romance, could say on such a subject.\r\nThis letter, not having slept on the road as Herbert did in Dublin,\r\nand having been conveyed with that lightning rapidity for which the\r\nBritish Post-office has ever been remarkable--and especially that\r\nportion of it which has reference to the sister island,--was in Mr.\r\nPrendergast\'s pocket when Herbert dined with him. That letter, and\r\nanother to which we shall have to refer more specially. But so much\r\nat variance were Mr. Prendergast\'s ideas from those entertained by\r\nMr. Somers, that he would not even speak to Herbert on the subject.\r\nPerhaps, also, that other more important letter, which, if we live,\r\nwe shall read at length, might also have had some effect in keeping\r\nhim silent.\r\n\r\nBut in truth Mr. Somers\' mind, and that of Mr. Prendergast, did not\r\nwork in harmony on this subject. Judging of the two men together by\r\ntheir usual deeds and ascertained character, we may say that there\r\nwas much more romance about Mr. Prendergast than there was about\r\nMr. Somers. But then it was a general romance, and not one with\r\nan individual object. Or perhaps we may say, without injury to\r\nMr. Somers, that it was a true feeling, and not a false one. Mr.\r\nPrendergast, also, was much more anxious for the welfare of Herbert\r\nFitzgerald than that of his cousin; but then he could feel on behalf\r\nof the man for whom he was interested that it did not behove him to\r\ntake a present of an estate from the hands of the true owner.\r\n\r\nFor more than a week Mr. Somers waited, but got no reply to his\r\nletter, and heard nothing from Mr. Prendergast; and during this time\r\nhe was really puzzled as to what he should do. As regarded himself,\r\nhe did not know at what moment his income might end, or how long\r\nhe and his family might be allowed to inhabit the house which he\r\nnow held: and then he could take no steps as to the tenants; could\r\nneither receive money nor pay it away, and was altogether at his\r\nwits\' ends. Lady Fitzgerald looked to him for counsel in everything,\r\nand he did not know how to counsel her. Arrangements were to be made\r\nfor an auction in the house as soon as she should be able to move;\r\nbut would it not be a thousand pities to sell all the furniture if\r\nthere was a prospect of the family returning? And so he waited for\r\nMr. Prendergast\'s letter with an uneasy heart and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\nBut still he attended the relief committees, and worked at the\r\nsoup-kitchens attached to the estate, as though he were still the\r\nagent to Castle Richmond; and still debated warmly with Father\r\nBarney on one side, and Mr. Townsend on the other, on that vexatious\r\nquestion of out-door relief. And now the famine was in full swing;\r\nand, strange to say, men had ceased to be uncomfortable about\r\nit;--such men, that is, as Mr. Somers and Mr. Townsend. The cutting\r\noff of maimed limbs, and wrenching out from their sockets of smashed\r\nbones, is by no means shocking to the skilled practitioner. And dying\r\npaupers, with "the drag" in their face--that certain sign of coming\r\ndeath of which I have spoken--no longer struck men to the heart. Like\r\nthe skilled surgeon, they worked hard enough at what good they could\r\ndo, and worked the better in that they could treat the cases without\r\nexpress compassion for the individuals that met their eyes. In\r\nadministering relief one may rob five unseen sufferers of what would\r\nkeep them in life if one is moved to bestow all that is comfortable\r\non one sufferer that is seen. Was it wise to spend money in\r\nalleviating the last hours of those whose doom was already spoken,\r\nwhich money, if duly used, might save the lives of others not yet\r\nso far gone in misery? And so in one sense those who were the best\r\nin the county, who worked the hardest for the poor and spent their\r\ntime most completely among them, became the hardest of heart, and\r\nmost obdurate in their denials. It was strange to see devoted women\r\nneglecting the wants of the dying, so that they might husband their\r\nstrength and time and means for the wants of those who might still be\r\nkept among the living.\r\n\r\nAt this time there came over to the parish of Drumbarrow a young\r\nEnglish clergyman who might be said to be in many respects the very\r\nopposite to Mr. Townsend. Two men could hardly be found in the\r\nsame profession more opposite in their ideas, lives, purposes, and\r\npursuits;--with this similarity, however, that each was a sincere,\r\nand on the whole an honest man. The Rev. Mr. Carter was much the\r\njunior, being at that time under thirty. He had now visited Ireland\r\nwith the sole object of working among the poor, and distributing\r\naccording to his own judgment certain funds which had been collected\r\nfor this purpose in England.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed there did often exist in England at this time a\r\nmisapprehension as to Irish wants, which led to some misuses of the\r\nfunds which England so liberally sent. It came at that time to be\r\nthe duty of a certain public officer to inquire into a charge made\r\nagainst a seemingly respectable man in the far west of Ireland,\r\npurporting that he had appropriated to his own use a sum of twelve\r\npounds sent to him for the relief of the poor of his parish. It had\r\nbeen sent by three English maiden ladies to the relieving officer\r\nof the parish of Kilcoutymorrow, and had come to his hands, he then\r\nfilling that position. He, so the charge said,--and unfortunately\r\nsaid so with only too much truth,--had put the twelve pounds into\r\nhis own private pocket. The officer\'s duty in the matter took him to\r\nthe chairman of the Relief Committee, a stanch old Roman Catholic\r\ngentleman nearly eighty years of age, with a hoary head and white\r\nbeard, and a Milesian name that had come down to him through\r\ncenturies of Catholic ancestors;--a man urbane in his manner, of the\r\nold school, an Irishman such as one does meet still here and there\r\nthrough the country, but now not often--one who above all things was\r\ntrue to the old religion.\r\n\r\nThen the officer of the government told his story to the old Irish\r\ngentleman--with many words, for there were all manner of small\r\ncollateral proofs, to all of which the old Irish gentleman listened\r\nwith a courtesy and patience which were admirable. And when the\r\nofficer of the government had done, the old Irish gentleman thus\r\nreplied:--\r\n\r\n"My neighbour Hobbs,"--such was the culprit\'s name--"has undoubtedly\r\ndone this thing. He has certainly spent upon his own uses the\r\ngenerous offering made to our poor parish by those noble-minded\r\nladies, the three Miss Walkers. But he has acted with perfect honesty\r\nin the matter."\r\n\r\n"What!" said the government officer, "robbing the poor, and at such a\r\ntime as this!"\r\n\r\n"No robbery at all, dear sir," said the good old Irish gentleman,\r\nwith the blandest of all possible smiles; "the excellent Miss\r\nWalkers sent their money for the Protestant poor of the parish of\r\nKilcoutymorrow, and Mr. Hobbs is the only Protestant within it." And\r\nfrom the twinkle in the old man\'s eye, it was clear to see that his\r\ntriumph consisted in this,--that not only he had but one Protestant\r\nin the parish, but that that Protestant should have learned so little\r\nfrom his religion.\r\n\r\nBut this is an episode. And nowadays no episodes are allowed.\r\n\r\nAnd now Mr. Carter had come over to see that if possible certain\r\nEnglish funds were distributed according to the wishes of the\r\ngenerous English hearts by whom they had been sent. For as some\r\nEnglish, such as the three Miss Walkers, feared on the one hand that\r\nthe Babylonish woman so rampant in Ireland might swallow up their\r\nmoney for Babylonish purposes; so, on the other hand, did others\r\ndread that the too stanch Protestantism of the church militant in\r\nthat country might expend the funds collected for undoubted bodily\r\nwants in administering to the supposed wants of the soul. No such\r\nfaults did, in truth, at that time prevail. The indomitable force of\r\nthe famine had absolutely knocked down all that; but there had been\r\nthings done in Ireland, before the famine came upon them, which gave\r\nreasonable suspicion for such fears.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend among others had been very active in soliciting aid\r\nfrom England, and hence had arisen a correspondence between him and\r\nMr. Carter; and now Mr. Carter had arrived at Drumbarrow with a\r\nrespectable sum to his credit at the provincial bank, and an intense\r\ndesire to make himself useful in this time of sore need. Mr. Carter\r\nwas a tall, thin, austere-looking man; one, seemingly, who had\r\nmacerated himself inwardly and outwardly by hard living. He had a\r\nhigh, narrow forehead, a sparse amount of animal development, thin\r\nlips, and a piercing, sharp, gray eye. He was a man, too, of few\r\nwords, and would have been altogether harsh in his appearance had\r\nthere not been that in the twinkle of his eye which seemed to say\r\nthat, in spite of all that his gait said to the contrary, the cockles\r\nof his heart might yet be reached by some play of wit--if only the\r\nwit were to his taste.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter was a man of personal means, so that he not only was not\r\ndependent on his profession, but was able--as he also was willing--to\r\naid that profession by his liberality. In one thing only was he\r\npersonally expensive. As to his eating and drinking it was, or might\r\nhave been for any solicitude of his own, little more than bread\r\nand water. As for the comforts of home, he had none, for since his\r\nordination his missions had ever been migrating. But he always\r\ndressed with care, and consequently with expense, for careful\r\ndressing is ever expensive. He always wore new black gloves, and\r\na very long black coat which never degenerated to rust, black\r\ncloth trousers, a high black silk waistcoat, and a new black hat.\r\nEverything about him was black except his neck, and that was always\r\nscrupulously white.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter was a good man--one may say a very good man--for he gave\r\nup himself and his money to carry out high views of charity and\r\nreligion, in which he was sincere with the sincerity of his whole\r\nheart, and from which he looked for no reward save such as the godly\r\never seek. But yet there was about him too much of the Pharisee.\r\nHe was greatly inclined to condemn other men, and to think none\r\nrighteous who differed from him. And now he had come to Ireland with\r\na certain conviction that the clergy of his own church there were men\r\nnot to be trusted; that they were mere Irish, and little better in\r\ntheir habits and doctrines than under-bred dissenters. He had been\r\nelsewhere in the country before he visited Drumbarrow, and had shown\r\nthis too plainly; but then Mr. Carter was a very young man, and it is\r\nnot perhaps fair to expect zeal and discretion also from those who\r\nare very young.\r\n\r\nMrs. Townsend had heard of him, and was in dismay when she found that\r\nhe was to stay with them at Drumbarrow parsonage for three days. If\r\nMr. Carter did not like clerical characters of her stamp, neither\r\ndid she like them of the stamp of Mr. Carter. She had heard of him,\r\nof his austerity, of his look, of his habits, and in her heart she\r\nbelieved him to be a Jesuit. Had she possessed full sway herself in\r\nthe parish of Drumbarrow, no bodies should have been saved at such\r\nterrible peril to the souls of the whole parish. But this Mr. Carter\r\ncame with such recommendation--with such assurances of money given\r\nand to be given, of service done and to be done,--that there was no\r\nrefusing him. And so the husband, more worldly wise than his wife,\r\nhad invited the Jesuit to his parsonage.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find, \xc6neas, he\'ll have mass in his room in the morning\r\ninstead of coming to family prayers," said the wife.\r\n\r\n"But what on earth shall we give him for dinner?" said the husband,\r\nwhose soul at the present moment was among the flesh-pots; and indeed\r\nMrs. Townsend had also turned over that question in her prudent mind.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll not eat meat in Lent, you may be sure," said Mrs. Townsend,\r\nremembering that that was the present period of the year.\r\n\r\n"And if he would there is none for him to eat," said Mr. Townsend,\r\ncalling to mind the way in which the larder had of late been emptied.\r\n\r\nProtestant clergymen in Ireland in those days had very frequently\r\nother reasons for fasting than those prescribed by ecclesiastical\r\ncanons. A well-nurtured lady, the wife of a parish rector in the\r\ncounty Cork, showed me her larder one day about that time. It\r\ncontained two large loaves of bread, and a pan full of stuff which I\r\nshould have called paste, but which she called porridge. It was all\r\nthat she had for herself, her husband, her children, and her charity.\r\nHer servants had left her before she came to that pass. And she was a\r\nwell-nurtured, handsome, educated woman, born to such comforts as you\r\nand I enjoy every day,--oh, my reader! perhaps without much giving of\r\nthanks for them. Poor lady! the struggle was too much for her, and\r\nshe died under it.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend was, as I have said, the very opposite to Mr. Carter,\r\nbut he also was a man who could do without the comforts of life, if\r\nthe comforts of life did not come readily in his way. He liked his\r\nglass of whisky punch dearly, and had an idea that it was good for\r\nhim. Not caring much about personal debts, he would go in debt for\r\nwhisky. But if the whisky and credit were at an end, the loss did not\r\nmake him miserable. He was a man with a large appetite, and who took\r\ngreat advantage of a good dinner when it was before him; nay, he\r\nwould go a long distance to insure a good dinner; but, nevertheless,\r\nhe would leave himself without the means of getting a mutton chop,\r\nand then not be unhappy. Now Mr. Carter would have been very unhappy\r\nhad he been left without his superfine long black coat.\r\n\r\nIn tendering his invitation to Mr. Carter, Mr. Townsend had explained\r\nthat with him the _res angusta domi_, which was always a prevailing\r\ndisease, had been heightened by the circumstances of the time; but\r\nthat of such crust and cup as he had, his brother English clergyman\r\nwould be made most welcome to partake. In answer to this, Mr. Carter\r\nhad explained that in these days good men thought but little of\r\ncrusts and cups, and that as regarded himself, nature had so made him\r\nthat he had but few concupiscences of that sort. And then, all this\r\nhaving been so far explained and settled, Mr. Carter came.\r\n\r\nThe first day the two clergymen spent together at Berryhill, and\r\nfound plenty to employ them. They were now like enough to be in want\r\nof funds at that Berryhill soup-kitchen, seeing that the great fount\r\nof supplies, the house, namely, of Castle Richmond, would soon have\r\nstopped running altogether. And Mr. Carter was ready to provide\r\nfunds to some moderate extent if all his questions were answered\r\nsatisfactorily. "There was to be no making of Protestants," he said,\r\n"by giving away of soup purchased with his money." Mr. Townsend\r\nthought that this might have been spared him. "I regret to say,"\r\nreplied he, with some touch of sarcasm, "that we have no time for\r\nthat now." "And so better," said Mr. Carter, with a sarcasm of a\r\nblunter sort. "So better. Let us not clog our alms with impossible\r\nconditions which will only create falsehood." "Any conditions are out\r\nof the question when one has to feed a whole parish," answered Mr.\r\nTownsend.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mr. Carter would teach them how to boil their yellow meal,\r\non which subject he had a theory totally opposite to the practice\r\nof the woman employed at the soup-kitchen. "Av we war to hocus it\r\nthat, yer riverence," said Mrs. Daly, turning to Mr. Townsend, "the\r\ncrathurs couldn\'t ate a bit of it; it wouldn\'t bile at all, at all,\r\nnot like that."\r\n\r\n"Try it, woman," said Mr. Carter, when he had uttered his receipt\r\noracularly for the third time.\r\n\r\n"\'Deed an\' I won\'t," said Mrs. Daly, whose presence there was pretty\r\nnearly a labour of love, and who was therefore independent. "It\'d be\r\na sin an\' a shame to spile Christian vittels in them times, an\' I\r\nwon\'t do it." And then there was some hard work that day; and though\r\nMr. Townsend kept his temper with his visitor, seeing that he had\r\nmuch to get and nothing to give, he did not on this occasion learn to\r\nalter his general opinion of his brethren of the English high church.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when they got home, very hungry after their toil, Mr.\r\nTownsend made another apology for the poorness of his table. "I am\r\nalmost ashamed," said he, "to ask an English gentleman to sit down to\r\nsuch a dinner as Mrs. Townsend will put before you."\r\n\r\n"And indeed then it isn\'t much," said Mrs. Townsend; "just a bit of\r\nfish I found going the road."\r\n\r\n"My dear madam, anything will suffice," said Mr. Carter, somewhat\r\npretentiously. And anything would have sufficed. Had they put before\r\nhim a mess of that paste of which I have spoken he would have ate it\r\nand said nothing,--ate enough of it at least to sustain him till the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nBut things had not come to so bad a pass as this at\r\nDrumbarrow parsonage; and, indeed, that day fortune had been\r\npropitious;--fortune which ever favours the daring. Mrs. Townsend,\r\nknowing that she had really nothing in the house, had sent Jerry to\r\nwaylay the Lent fishmonger, who twice a week was known to make his\r\nway from Kanturk to Mallow with a donkey and panniers; and Jerry had\r\nreturned with a prize.\r\n\r\nAnd now they sat down to dinner, and lo and behold, to the great\r\nsurprise of Mr. Carter, and perhaps also to the surprise of the host,\r\na magnificent turbot smoked upon the board. The fins no doubt had\r\nbeen cut off to render possible the insertion of the animal into the\r\nlargest of the Drumbarrow parsonage kitchen-pots,--an injury against\r\nwhich Mr. Townsend immediately exclaimed angrily. "My goodness,\r\nthey have cut off the fins!" said he, holding up both hands in deep\r\ndismay. According to his philosophy, if he did have a turbot, why\r\nshould he not have it with all its perfections about it--fins and\r\nall?\r\n\r\n"My dear \xc6neas!" said Mrs. Townsend, looking at him with that agony\r\nof domestic distress which all wives so well know how to assume.\r\n\r\nMr. Carter said nothing. He said not a word, but he thought much.\r\nThis then was their pretended poorness of living! with all their mock\r\nhumility, these false Irishmen could not resist the opportunity of\r\nshowing off before the English stranger, and of putting on their\r\ntable before him a dish which an English dean could afford only on\r\ngala days. And then this clergyman, who was so loudly anxious for\r\nthe poor, could not repress the sorrow of his heart because the\r\nrich delicacy was somewhat marred in the cooking. "It was too bad,"\r\nthought Mr. Carter to himself, "too bad."\r\n\r\n"None, thank you," said he, drawing himself up with gloomy\r\nreprobation of countenance. "I will not take any fish, I am much\r\nobliged to you."\r\n\r\nThen the face of Mrs. Townsend was one on which neither Christian\r\nnor heathen could have looked without horror and grief. What, the\r\nman whom in her heart she believed to be a Jesuit, and for whom\r\nnevertheless, Jesuit though he was, she had condescended to cater\r\nwith all her woman\'s wit!--this man, I say, would not eat fish in\r\nLent! And it was horrible to her warm Irish heart to think that after\r\nthat fish now upon the table there was nothing to come but two or\r\nthree square inches of cold bacon. Not eat turbot in Lent! Had he\r\nbeen one of her own sort she might have given him credit for true\r\nantagonism to popery; but every inch of his coat gave the lie to such\r\na supposition as that.\r\n\r\n"Do take a bit," said Mr. Townsend, hospitably. "The fins should not\r\nhave been cut off, otherwise I never saw a finer fish in my life."\r\n\r\n"None, I am very much obliged to you," said Mr. Carter, with sternest\r\nreprobation of feature.\r\n\r\nIt was too much for Mrs. Townsend. "Oh, \xc6neas," said she, "what are\r\nwe to do?" Mr. Townsend merely shrugged his shoulders, while he\r\nhelped himself. His feelings were less acute, perhaps, than those\r\nof his wife, and he, no doubt, was much more hungry. Mr. Carter\r\nthe while sat by, saying nothing, but looking daggers. He also was\r\nhungry, but under such circumstances he would rather starve than eat.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you ever eat fish, Mr. Carter?" said Mr. Townsend, proceeding\r\nto help himself for a second time, and poking about round the edges\r\nof the delicate creature before him for some relics of the glutinous\r\nmorsels which he loved so well. He was not, however, enjoying it\r\nas he should have done, for seeing that his guest ate none, and\r\nthat his wife\'s appetite was thoroughly marred, he was alone in his\r\noccupation. No one but a glutton could have feasted well under such\r\ncircumstances, and Mr. Townsend was not a glutton.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, I will eat none to-day," said Mr. Carter, sitting bolt\r\nupright, and fixing his keen gray eyes on the wall opposite.\r\n\r\n"Then you may take away, Biddy; I\'ve done with it. But it\'s a\r\nthousand pities such a fish should have been so wasted."\r\n\r\nThe female heart of Mrs. Townsend could stand these wrongs no longer,\r\nand with a tear in one corner of her eye, and a gleam of anger in the\r\nother, she at length thus spoke out. "I am sure then I don\'t know\r\nwhat you will eat, Mr. Carter, and I did think that all you English\r\nclergymen always ate fish in Lent,--and indeed nothing else; for\r\nindeed people do say that you are much the same as the papists in\r\nthat respect."\r\n\r\n"Hush, my dear!" said Mr. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"Well, but I can\'t hush when there\'s nothing for the gentleman to\r\neat."\r\n\r\n"My dear madam, such a matter does not signify in the least," said\r\nMr. Carter, not unbending an inch.\r\n\r\n"But it does signify; it signifies a great deal; and so you\'d know if\r\nyou were a family man;"--"as you ought to be," Mrs. Townsend would\r\nhave been delighted to add. "And I\'m sure I sent Jerry five miles,\r\nand he was gone four hours to get that bit of fish from Paddy\r\nMagrath, as he stops always at Ballygibblin Gate; and indeed I\r\nthought myself so lucky, for I only gave Jerry one and sixpence. But\r\nthey had an uncommon take of fish yesterday at Skibbereen, and--"\r\n\r\n"One and sixpence!" said Mr. Carter, now slightly relaxing his brow\r\nfor the first time.\r\n\r\n"I\'d have got it for one and three," said Mr. Townsend, upon whose\r\nmind an inkling of the truth was beginning to dawn.\r\n\r\n"Indeed and you wouldn\'t, \xc6neas; and Jerry was forced to promise the\r\nman a glass of whisky the first time he comes this road, which he\r\ndoes sometimes. That fish weighed over nine pounds, every ounce of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Nine fiddlesticks," said Mr. Townsend.\r\n\r\n"I weighed it myself, \xc6neas, with my own hands, and it was nine\r\npounds four ounces before we were obliged to cut it, and as firm as a\r\nrock the flesh was."\r\n\r\n"For one and sixpence!" said Mr. Carter, relaxing still a little\r\nfurther, and condescending to look his hostess in the face.\r\n\r\n"Yes, for one and six; and now--"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I\'d have bought it for one and four, fins and all," said\r\nthe parson, determined to interrupt his wife in her pathos.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you would not then," said his wife, taking his assertion in\r\nearnest. "You could never market against Jerry in your life; I will\r\nsay that for him."\r\n\r\n"If you\'ll allow me to change my mind, I think I will have a little\r\nbit of it," said Mr. Carter, almost humbly.\r\n\r\n"By all means," said Mr. Townsend. "Biddy, bring that fish back. Now\r\nI think of it, I have not half dined myself yet."\r\n\r\nAnd then they all three forgot their ill humours, and enjoyed their\r\ndinner thoroughly,--in spite of the acknowledged fault as touching\r\nthe lost fins of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nCONDEMNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that Lord Desmond rode home from Hap House that day in a\r\nquieter mood and at a slower pace than that which had brought him\r\nthither; and in truth it was so. He had things to think of now much\r\nmore serious than any that had filled his mind as he had cantered\r\nalong, joyously hoping that after all he might have for his brother\r\nthe man that he loved, and the owner of Castle Richmond also. This\r\nwas now impossible; but he felt that he loved Owen better than ever\r\nhe had done, and he was pledged to fight Owen\'s battle, let Owen be\r\never so poor.\r\n\r\n"And what does it signify after all?" he said to himself, as he rode\r\nalong. "We shall all be poor together, and then we sha\'n\'t mind it so\r\nmuch; and if I don\'t marry, Hap House itself will be something to add\r\nto the property;" and then he made up his mind that he could be happy\r\nenough, living at Desmond Court all his life, so long as he could\r\nhave Owen Fitzgerald near him to make life palatable.\r\n\r\nThat night he spoke to no one on the subject, at least to no one of\r\nhis own accord. When they were alone his mother asked him where he\r\nhad been; and when she learned that he had been at Hap House, she\r\nquestioned him much as to what had passed between him and Owen; but\r\nhe would tell her nothing, merely saying that Owen had spoken of\r\nClara with his usual ecstasy of love, but declining to go into the\r\nsubject at any length. The countess, however, gathered from him\r\nthat he and Owen were on kindly terms together, and so far she felt\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he made up his mind "to have it out," as\r\nhe called it, with Clara; but when the hour came his courage failed\r\nhim: it was a difficult task--that which he was now to undertake--of\r\nexplaining to her his wish that she should go back to her old lover,\r\nnot because he was no longer poor, but, as it were in spite of his\r\npoverty, and as a reward to him for consenting to remain poor. As\r\nhe had thought about it while riding home, it had seemed feasible\r\nenough. He would tell her how nobly Owen was going to behave to\r\nHerbert, and would put it to her whether, as he intended willingly\r\nto abandon the estate, he ought not to be put into possession of the\r\nwife. There was a romantic justice about this which he thought would\r\ntouch Clara\'s heart. But on the following morning when he came to\r\nthink what words he would use for making his little proposition, the\r\npicture did not seem to him to be so beautiful. If Clara really loved\r\nHerbert--and she had declared that she did twenty times over--it\r\nwould be absurd to expect her to give him up merely because he was\r\nnot a ruined man. But then, which did she love? His mother declared\r\nthat she loved Owen. "That\'s the real question," said the earl to\r\nhimself, as on the second morning he made up his mind that he would\r\n"have it out" with Clara without any further delay. He must be true\r\nto Owen; that was his first great duty at the present moment.\r\n\r\n"Clara, I want to talk to you," he said, breaking suddenly into the\r\nroom where she usually sat alone o\' mornings. "I was at Hap House the\r\nday before yesterday with Owen Fitzgerald, and to tell you the truth\r\nat once, we were talking about you the whole time we were there. And\r\nnow what I want is, that something should be settled, so that we may\r\nall understand one another."\r\n\r\nThese words he spoke to her quite abruptly. When he first said that\r\nhe wished to speak to her, she had got up from her chair to welcome\r\nhim, for she dearly loved to have him there. There was nothing\r\nshe liked better than having him to herself when he was in a soft\r\nbrotherly humour; and then she would interest herself about his\r\nhorse, and his dogs, and his gun, and predict his life for him,\r\nsending him up as a peer to Parliament, and giving him a noble wife,\r\nand promising him that he should be such a Desmond as would redeem\r\nall the family from their distresses. But now as he rapidly brought\r\nout his words, she found that on this day her prophecies must regard\r\nherself chiefly.\r\n\r\n"Surely, Patrick, it is easy enough to understand me," she said.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know; I don\'t in the least mean to find fault with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that, dearest," she said, laying her hand upon his arm.\r\n\r\n"But my mother says one thing, and you another, and Owen another; and\r\nI myself, I hardly know what to say."\r\n\r\n"Look here, Patrick, it is simply this: I became engaged to Herbert\r\nwith my mother\'s sanction and yours; and now--"\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment," said the impetuous boy, "and do not pledge yourself\r\nto anything till you have heard me. I know that you are cut to the\r\nheart about Herbert Fitzgerald losing his property."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed; not at all cut to the heart; that is as regards myself."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mean as regards yourself; I mean as regards him. I have\r\nheard you say over and over again that it is a piteous thing that he\r\nshould be so treated. Have I not?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I have said that, and I think so."\r\n\r\n"And I think that most of your great--great--great love for him, if\r\nyou will, comes from that sort of feeling."\r\n\r\n"But, Patrick, it came long before."\r\n\r\n"Dear Clara, do listen to me, will you? You may at any rate do as\r\nmuch as that for me." And then Clara stood perfectly mute, looking\r\ninto his handsome face as he continued to rattle out his words at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Now if you please, Clara, you may have the means of giving back to\r\nhim all his property, every shilling that he ever had, or expected\r\nto have. Owen Fitzgerald,--who certainly is the finest fellow that\r\never I came across in all my life, or ever shall, if I live to five\r\nhundred,--says that he will make over every acre of Castle Richmond\r\nback to his cousin Herbert if--" Oh, my lord, my lord, what a scheme\r\nis this you are concocting to entrap your sister! Owen Fitzgerald\r\ninserted no "if," as you are well aware! "If," he continued, with\r\nsome little qualm of conscience, "if you will consent to be his\r\nwife."\r\n\r\n"Patrick!"\r\n\r\n"Listen, now listen. He thinks, and, Clara, by the heavens above me!\r\nI think also that you did love him better than you ever loved Herbert\r\nFitzgerald." Clara as she heard these words blushed ruby red up\r\nto her very hair, but she said never a word. "And I think, and he\r\nthinks, that you are bound now to Herbert by his misfortunes--that\r\nyou feel that you cannot desert him because he has fallen so low. By\r\nGeorge, Clara, I am proud of you for sticking to him through thick\r\nand thin, now that he is down! But the matter will be very difficult\r\nif you have the means of giving back to him all that he has lost, as\r\nyou have. Owen will be poor, but he is a prince among men. By heaven,\r\nClara, if you will only say that he is your choice, Herbert shall\r\nhave back all Castle Richmond! and I--I shall never marry, and you\r\nmay give to the man that I love as my brother all that there is left\r\nto us of Desmond."\r\n\r\nThere was something grand about the lad\'s eager tone of voice as he\r\nmade his wild proposal, and something grand also about his heart. He\r\nmeant what he said, foolish as he was either to mean or to say it.\r\nClara burst into tears, and threw herself into his arms. "You don\'t\r\nunderstand," she said, through her sobs, "my own, own brother; you do\r\nnot understand."\r\n\r\n"But, by Jove! I think I do understand. As sure as you are a living\r\ngirl he will give back Castle Richmond to Herbert Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\nShe recovered herself, and leaving her brother\'s arms, walked away to\r\nthe window, and from thence looked down to that path beneath the elms\r\nwhich was the spot in the world which she thought of the oftenest;\r\nbut as she gazed, there was no lack of loyalty in her heart to the\r\nman to whom she was betrothed. It seemed to her as though those\r\nchildish days had been in another life; as though Owen had been her\r\nlover in another world,--a sweet, childish, innocent, happy world\r\nwhich she remembered well, but which was now dissevered from her by\r\nan impassable gulf. She thought of his few words of love,--so few\r\nthat she remembered every word that he had then spoken, and thought\r\nof them with a singular mixture of pain and pleasure. And now she\r\nheard of his noble self-denial with a thrill which was in no degree\r\nenhanced by the fact that she, or even Herbert, was to be the gainer\r\nby it. She rejoiced at his nobility, merely because it was a joy to\r\nher to know that he was so noble. And yet all through this she was\r\ntrue to Herbert. Another work-a-day world had come upon her in her\r\nwomanhood, and as that came she had learned to love a man of another\r\nstamp, with a love that was quieter, more subdued, and perhaps, as\r\nshe thought, more enduring. Whatever might be Herbert\'s lot in life,\r\nthat lot she would share. Her love for Owen should never be more to\r\nher than a dream.\r\n\r\n"Did he send you to me?" she said at last, without turning her face\r\naway from the window.\r\n\r\n"Yes, then, he did; he did send me to you, and he told me to say that\r\nas Owen of Hap House he loved you still. And I, I promised to do his\r\nbidding; and I promised, moreover, that as far as my good word could\r\ngo with you, he should have it. And now you know it all; if you care\r\nfor my pleasure in the matter you will take Owen, and let Herbert\r\nhave his property. By Jove! if he is treated in that way he cannot\r\ncomplain."\r\n\r\n"Patrick," said she, returning to him and again laying her hand on\r\nhim. "You must now take my message also. You must go to him and bid\r\nhim come here that I may see him."\r\n\r\n"Who? Owen?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Owen Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Very well, I have no objection in life." And the earl thought that\r\nthe difficulty was really about to be overcome. "And about my\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell mamma."\r\n\r\n"And what shall I say to Owen?"\r\n\r\n"Say nothing to him, but bid him come here. But wait, Patrick; yes;\r\nhe must not misunderstand me; I can never, never, never marry him."\r\n\r\n"Clara!"\r\n\r\n"Never, never; it is impossible. Dear Patrick, I am so sorry to\r\nmake you unhappy, and I love you so very dearly,--better than ever,\r\nI think, for speaking as you do now. But that can never be. Let\r\nhim come here, however, and I myself will tell him all." At last,\r\ndisgusted and unhappy though he was, the earl did accept the\r\ncommission, and again on that afternoon rode across the fields to Hap\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n"I will tell him nothing but that he is to come," said the earl\r\nto himself as he went thither. And he did tell Owen nothing else.\r\nFitzgerald questioned him much, but learned but little from him. "By\r\nheavens, Owen," he said, "you must settle the matter between you, for\r\nI don\'t understand it. She has bid me ask you to come to her; and now\r\nyou must fight your own battle." Fitzgerald of course said that he\r\nwould obey, and so Lord Desmond left him.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Clara told her mother. "Owen Fitzgerald is to be here\r\nto-morrow," she said.\r\n\r\n"Owen Fitzgerald; is he?" said the countess. She hardly knew how to\r\nbear herself, or how to interfere so as to assist her own object; or\r\nhow not to interfere, lest she should mar it.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mamma. Patrick saw him the other day, and I think it is better\r\nthat I should see him also."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear. But you must be aware, Clara, that you have been\r\nso very--I don\'t wish to say headstrong exactly--so very _ent\xeat\xe9e_\r\nabout your own affairs, that I hardly know how to speak of them. If\r\nyour brother is in your confidence I shall be satisfied."\r\n\r\n"He is in my confidence; and so may you be also, mamma, if you\r\nplease."\r\n\r\nBut the countess thought it better not to have any conversation\r\nforced upon her at that moment; and so she asked her daughter for no\r\nfurther show of confidence then. It would probably be as well that\r\nOwen should come and plead his own cause.\r\n\r\nAnd Owen did come. All that night and on the next morning the poor\r\ngirl remained alone in a state of terrible doubt. She had sent for\r\nher old lover, thinking at the moment that no one could explain to\r\nhim in language so clear as her own what was her fixed resolve. And\r\nshe had too been so moved by the splendour of his offer, that she\r\nlonged to tell him what she thought of it. The grandeur of that offer\r\nwas enhanced tenfold in her mind by the fact that it had been so\r\nframed as to include her in this comparative poverty with which Owen\r\nhimself was prepared to rest contented. He had known that she was not\r\nto be bought by wealth, and had given her credit for a nobility that\r\nwas akin to his own.\r\n\r\nBut yet, now that the moment was coming, how was she to talk to him?\r\nHow was she to speak the words which would rob him of his hope, and\r\ntell him that he did not, could not, never could possess that one\r\ntreasure which he desired more than houses and lands, or station and\r\nrank? Alas, alas! If it could have been otherwise! If it could have\r\nbeen otherwise! She also was in love with poverty;--but at any rate,\r\nno one could accuse her now of sacrificing a poor lover for a rich\r\none. Herbert Fitzgerald would be poor enough.\r\n\r\nAnd then he came. They had hitherto met but once since that\r\nafternoon, now so long ago--that afternoon to which she looked back\r\nas to another former world--and that meeting had been in the very\r\nroom in which she was now prepared to receive him. But her feelings\r\ntowards him had been very different then. Then he had almost forced\r\nhimself upon her, and for months previously she had heard nothing of\r\nhim but what was evil. He had come complaining loudly, and her heart\r\nhad been somewhat hardened against him. Now he was there at her\r\nbidding, and her heart and very soul were full of tenderness. She\r\nrose rapidly, and sat down again, and then again rose as she heard\r\nhis footsteps; but when he entered the room she was standing in the\r\nmiddle of it.\r\n\r\n"Clara," he said, taking the hand which she mechanically held out, "I\r\nhave come here now at your brother\'s request."\r\n\r\nHer name sounded so sweet upon his lips. No idea occurred to her that\r\nshe ought to be angry with him for using it. Angry with him! Could it\r\nbe possible that she should ever be angry with him--that she ever had\r\nbeen so?\r\n\r\n"Yes," she said. "Patrick said something to me which made me think\r\nthat it would be better that we should meet."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; it is better. If people are honest they had always better\r\nsay to each other\'s faces that which they have to say."\r\n\r\n"I mean to be honest, Mr. Fitzgerald."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am sure you do; and so do I also. And if this is so, why\r\ncannot we say each to the other that which we have to say? My tale\r\nwill be a very short one; but it will be true if it is short."\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Fitzgerald--"\r\n\r\n"Well, Clara?"\r\n\r\n"Will you not sit down?" And she herself sat upon the sofa; and he\r\ndrew a chair for himself near to her; but he was too impetuous to\r\nremain seated on it long. During the interview between them he was\r\nsometimes standing, and sometimes walking quickly about the room; and\r\nthen for a moment he would sit down, or lean down over her on the\r\nsofa arm.\r\n\r\n"But, Mr. Fitzgerald, it is my tale that I wish you to hear."\r\n\r\n"Well; I will listen to it." But he did not listen; for before she\r\nhad spoken a dozen words he had interrupted her, and poured out upon\r\nher his own wild plans and generous schemes. She, poor girl, had\r\nthought to tell him that she loved Herbert, and Herbert only--as a\r\nlover. But that if she could love him, him Owen, as a brother and a\r\nfriend, that love she would so willingly give him. And then she would\r\nhave gone on to say how impossible it would have been for Herbert,\r\nunder any circumstances, to have availed himself of such generosity\r\nas that which had been offered. But her eloquence was all cut short\r\nin the bud. How could she speak with such a storm of impulse raging\r\nbefore her as that which was now strong within Owen Fitzgerald\'s\r\nbosom?\r\n\r\nHe interrupted her before she had spoken a dozen words, in order that\r\nhe might exhibit before her eyes the project with which his bosom was\r\nfilled. This he did, standing for the most part before her, looking\r\ndown upon her as she sat beneath him, with her eyes fixed upon the\r\nfloor, while his were riveted on her down-turned face. She knew it\r\nall before--all this that he had to say to her, or she would hardly\r\nhave understood it from his words, they were so rapid and vehement.\r\nAnd yet they were tender, too; spoken in a loving tone, and\r\ncontaining ever and anon assurances of respect, and a resolve to be\r\nguided now and for ever by her wishes,--even though those wishes\r\nshould be utterly subversive of his happiness.\r\n\r\n"And now you know it all," he said, at last. "And as for my cousin\'s\r\nproperty, that is safe enough. No earthly consideration would induce\r\nme to put a hand upon that, seeing that by all justice it is his."\r\nBut in this she hardly yet quite understood him. "Let him have what\r\nluck he may in other respects, he shall still be master of Castle\r\nRichmond. If it were that that you wanted--as I know it is not--that\r\nI cannot give you. I cannot tell you with what scorn I should regard\r\nmyself if I were to take advantage of such an accident as this to rob\r\nany man of his estate."\r\n\r\nHer brother had been right, so Clara felt, when he declared that Owen\r\nFitzgerald was the finest fellow that ever he had come across. She\r\nmade another such declaration within her own heart, only with words\r\nthat were more natural to her. He was the noblest gentleman of whom\r\nshe had ever heard, or read, or thought.\r\n\r\n"But," continued Owen, "as I will not interfere with him in that\r\nwhich should be his, neither should he interfere with me in that\r\nwhich should be mine. Clara, the only estate that I claim is your\r\nheart."\r\n\r\nAnd that estate she could not give him. On that at any rate she was\r\nfixed. She could not barter herself about from one to the other\r\neither as a make-weight or a counterpoise. All his pleading was in\r\nvain; all his generosity would fail in securing to him this one\r\nreward that he desired. And now she had to tell him so.\r\n\r\n"Your brother seems to think," he continued, "that you still--;" but\r\nnow it was her turn to interrupt him.\r\n\r\n"Patrick is mistaken," she said, with her eyes still fixed upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n"What. You will tell me, then, that I am utterly indifferent to you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no; I did not say so." And now she got up and took hold of\r\nhis arm, and looked into his face imploringly. "I did not say so.\r\nBut, oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, be kind to me, be forbearing with me, be\r\ngood to me," and she almost embraced his arm as she appealed to him,\r\nwith her eyes all swimming with tears.\r\n\r\n"Good to you!" he said. And a strong passion came upon him, urging\r\nhim to throw his arm round her slender body, and press her to his\r\nbosom. Good to her! would he not protect her with his life\'s blood\r\nagainst all the world if she would only come to him? "Good to you,\r\nClara! Can you not trust me that I will be good to you if you will\r\nlet me?"\r\n\r\n"But not so, Owen." It was the first time she had ever called him\r\nby his name, and she blushed again as she remembered that it was so.\r\n"Not good, as you mean, for now I must trust to another for that\r\ngoodness. Herbert must be my husband, Owen; but will not you be our\r\nfriend?"\r\n\r\n"Herbert must be your husband!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, yes. It is so. Do not look at me in that way, pray do not;\r\nwhat would you have me do? You would not have me false to my troth,\r\nand false to my own heart, because you are generous. Be generous to\r\nme--to me also."\r\n\r\nHe turned away from her, and walked the whole length of the long\r\nroom; away and back, before he answered her, and even then, when he\r\nhad returned to her, he stood, looking at her before he spoke. And\r\nshe now looked full into his face, hoping, but yet fearing; hoping\r\nthat he might yield to her; and fearing his terrible displeasure\r\nshould he not yield.\r\n\r\n"Clara," he said; and he spoke solemnly, slowly, and in a mood unlike\r\nhis own,--"I cannot as yet read your heart clearly; nor do I know\r\nwhether you can quite so read it yourself."\r\n\r\n"I can, I can," she answered quickly; "and you shall know it\r\nall--all, if you wish."\r\n\r\n"I want to know but one thing. Whom is it that you love? And,\r\nClara--," and this he said interrupting her as she was about to\r\nspeak. "I do not ask you to whom you are engaged. You have engaged\r\nyourself both to him and to me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald!"\r\n\r\n"I do not blame you; not in the least. But is it not so? as to that I\r\nwill ask no question, and say nothing; only this, that so far we are\r\nequal. But now ask of your own heart, and then answer me. Whom is it\r\nthen you love?"\r\n\r\n"Herbert Fitzgerald," she said. The words hardly formed themselves\r\ninto a whisper, but nevertheless they were audible enough to him.\r\n\r\n"Then I have no further business here," he said, and turned about as\r\nthough to leave the room.\r\n\r\nBut she ran forward and stopped him, standing between him and the\r\ndoor. "Oh, Mr. Fitzgerald, do not leave me like that. Say one word\r\nof kindness to me before you go. Tell me that you forgive me for the\r\ninjury I have done you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I forgive you."\r\n\r\n"And is that all? Oh, I will love you so, if you will let me;--as\r\nyour friend, as your sister; you shall be our dearest, best, and\r\nnearest friend. You do not know how good he is. Owen, will you not\r\ntell me that you will love me as a brother loves?"\r\n\r\n"No!" and the sternness of his face was such that it was dreadful to\r\nlook on it. "I will tell you nothing that is false."\r\n\r\n"And would that be false?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, false as hell! What, sit by at his hearth-stone and see you\r\nleaning on his bosom! Sleep under his roof while you were in his\r\narms! No, Lady Clara, that would not be possible. That virtue, if it\r\nbe virtue, I cannot possess."\r\n\r\n"And you must go from me in anger? If you knew what I am suffering\r\nyou would not speak to me so cruelly."\r\n\r\n"Cruel! I would not wish to be cruel to you; certainly not now, for\r\nwe shall not meet again; if ever, not for many years. I do not think\r\nthat I have been cruel to you."\r\n\r\n"Then say one word of kindness before you go!"\r\n\r\n"A word of kindness! Well; what shall I say? Every night, as\r\nI have lain in my bed, I have said words of kindness to you,\r\nsince--since--since longer than you will remember; since I first knew\r\nyou as a child. Do you ever think of the day when you walked with me\r\nround by the bridge?"\r\n\r\n"It is bootless thinking of that now."\r\n\r\n"Bootless! yes, and words of kindness are bootless. Between you and\r\nme, such words should be full of love, or they would have no meaning.\r\nWhat can I say to you that shall be both kind and true?"\r\n\r\n"Bid God bless me before you leave me."\r\n\r\n"Well, I will say that. May God bless you, in this world and in the\r\nnext! And now, Lady Clara Desmond, good-bye!" and he tendered to her\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nShe took it, and pressed it between both of hers, and looked up\r\ninto his face, and stood so while the fast tears ran down her face.\r\nHe must have been more or less than man had he not relented then.\r\n"And Owen," she said, "dear Owen, may God in his mercy bless you\r\nalso, and make you happy, and give you some one that you can love,\r\nand--and--teach you in your heart to forgive the injury I have done\r\nyou." And then she stooped down her head and pressed her lips upon\r\nthe hand which she held within her own.\r\n\r\n"Forgive you! Well--I do forgive you. Perhaps it may be right that we\r\nshould both forgive; though I have not wittingly brought unhappiness\r\nupon you. But what there is to be forgiven on my side, I do forgive.\r\nAnd--and I hope that you may be happy." They were the last words that\r\nhe spoke; and then leading her back to her seat, he placed her there,\r\nand without turning to look at her again, he left the room.\r\n\r\nHe hurried down into the court, and called for his horse. As he stood\r\nthere, when his foot was in the stirrup, and his hand on the animal\'s\r\nneck, Lord Desmond came up to him. "Good-bye, Desmond," he said. "It\r\nis all over; God knows when you and I may meet again." And without\r\nwaiting for a word of reply he rode out under the porch, and putting\r\nspurs to his horse, galloped fast across the park. The earl, when he\r\nspoke of it afterwards to his mother, said that Owen\'s face had been\r\nas it were a thundercloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nFOX-HUNTING IN SPINNY LANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it will be acknowledged that Mr. Prendergast had said no word\r\nthroughout the conversation recorded in a late chapter as having\r\ntaken place between him and Herbert Fitzgerald over their wine, which\r\ncould lead Herbert to think it possible that he might yet recover his\r\nlost inheritance; but nevertheless during the whole of that evening\r\nhe held in his pocket a letter, received by him only that afternoon,\r\nwhich did encourage him to think that such an event might at any rate\r\nbe possible. And, indeed, he held in his pocket two letters, having a\r\ntendency to the same effect, but we shall have nothing now to say as\r\nto that letter from Mr. Somers of which we have spoken before.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that up to this time certain inquiries had\r\nbeen going on with reference to the life of Mr. Matthew Mollett,\r\nand that these inquiries were being made by agents employed by Mr.\r\nPrendergast. He had found that Mollett\'s identity with Talbot had\r\nbeen so fully proved as to make it, in his opinion, absolutely\r\nnecessary that Herbert and his mother should openly give up Castle\r\nRichmond. But, nevertheless, without a hope, and in obedience solely\r\nto what he felt that prudence demanded in so momentous a matter,\r\nhe did prosecute all manner of inquiries;--but prosecuted them\r\naltogether in vain. And now, O thou most acute of lawyers, this new\r\ntwinkling spark of hope has come to thee from a source whence thou\r\nleast expectedst it!\r\n\r\n_Quod minime reris Grai\xe2 pandetur ab urbe._\r\n\r\nAnd then, as soon as Herbert was gone from him, crossing one leg over\r\nthe other as he sat in his easy chair, he took it from his pocket and\r\nread it for the third time. The signature at the end of it was very\r\nplain and legible, being that of a scholar no less accomplished than\r\nMr. Abraham Mollett. This letter we will have entire, though it was\r\nnot perhaps as short as it might have been. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   45 Tabernacle row London.\r\n   April--1847.\r\n\r\n   Respectit Sir--\r\n\r\n   In hall them doings about the Fitsjerrals at Carsal\r\n   Richmon I halways felt the most profound respict for you\r\n   because you wanted to do the thing as was rite wich was\r\n   what I halways wanted to myself only coodent becase of the\r\n   guvnor.

Leestways I thawt I new it, and so you\r\n   thawt too Mr. Pindargrasp only we was both running the\r\n   rong cent. But what did I do when I was so confounedly\r\n   disgusted by my guvnor ankring after the baronnites money\r\n   wich it wasnt rite nor yet onest. Why I went meself to\r\n   Appy ouse as you noes Mr. Pindargrasp, and was the first\r\n   to tel the Appy ouse gent hall about it. But wat dos he\r\n   do.

So no more\r\n   at presence but will com foward hany day to pruv hall this\r\n   agin my guvnor becase he arnt doing the thing as is rite\r\n   and I looks to you Mr. Pindargrasp to see as I gits someat\r\n   ansum sein as ow I coms forward agin the Appy ouse gent\r\n   and for the hother party oos side you is a bakkin.\r\n\r\n   I ham respictit Sir\r\n   Your umbel servant to command,\r\n\r\n   ABM. MOLLETT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot say that Mr. Prendergast believed much of this terribly long\r\nepistle when he first received it, or felt himself imbued with any\r\ngreat hope that his old friend\'s wife might be restored to her name\r\nand rank, and his old friend\'s son to his estate and fortune. But\r\nnevertheless he knew that it was worth inquiry. That Aby Mollett\r\nhad been kicked out of Hap House in a manner that must have been\r\nmortifying to his feelings, Mr. Prendergast had himself seen; and\r\nthat he would, therefore, do anything in his power to injure Owen\r\nFitzgerald, Mr. Prendergast was quite sure. That he was a viler\r\nwretch even than his father, Mr. Prendergast suspected,--having been\r\nled to think so by words which had fallen from Sir Thomas, and being\r\nfurther confirmed in that opinion by the letter now in his hand.\r\nHe was not, therefore, led into any strong opinion that these new\r\ntidings were of value. And, indeed, he was prone to disbelieve them,\r\nbecause they ran counter to a conviction which had already been\r\nmade in his own heart, and had been extensively acted on by him.\r\nNevertheless he resolved that even Aby\'s letter deserved attention,\r\nand that it should receive that attention early on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAnd thus he had sat for the three hours after dinner, chatting\r\ncomfortably with his young friend, and holding this letter in his\r\npocket. Had he shown it to Herbert, or spoken of it, he would have\r\nutterly disturbed the equilibrium of the embryo law student, and\r\nrendered his entrance in Mr. Die\'s chambers absolutely futile. "Ten\r\nwill not be too early for you," he had said. "Mr. Die is always in\r\nhis room by that hour." Herbert had of course declared that ten would\r\nnot be at all too early for him; and Mr. Prendergast had observed\r\nthat after leaving Mr. Die\'s chambers, he himself would go on to the\r\nCity. He might have said beyond the City, for his intended expedition\r\nwas to Spinny Lane, at St. Botolph\'s in the East.\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert was gone he sat musing over his fire with Aby\'s letter\r\nstill in his hand. A lawyer has always a sort of affection for a\r\nscoundrel,--such affection as a hunting man has for a fox. He loves\r\nto watch the skill and dodges of the animal, to study the wiles by\r\nwhich he lives, and to circumvent them by wiles of his own, still\r\nmore wily. It is his glory to run the beast down; but then he would\r\nnot for worlds run him down, except in conformity with certain laws,\r\nfixed by old custom for the guidance of men in such sports. And the\r\ntwo-legged vermin is adapted for pursuit as is the fox with four\r\nlegs. He is an unclean animal, leaving a scent upon his trail, which\r\nthe nose of your acute law hound can pick up over almost any ground.\r\nAnd the more wily the beast is, the longer he can run, the more\r\ntrouble he can give in the pursuit, the longer he can stand up before\r\na pack of legal hounds, the better does the forensic sportsman love\r\nand value him. There are foxes of so excellent a nature, so keen in\r\ntheir dodges, so perfect in their cunning, so skilful in evasion,\r\nthat a sportsman cannot find it in his heart to push them to their\r\ndestruction unless the field be very large so that many eyes are\r\nlooking on. And the feeling is I think the same with lawyers.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast had always felt a tenderness towards the Molletts,\r\nfather and son,--a tenderness which would by no means have prevented\r\nhim from sending them both to the halter had that been necessary, and\r\nhad they put themselves so far in his power. Much as the sportsman\r\nloves the fox, it is a moment to him of keen enjoyment when he puts\r\nhis heavy boot on the beast\'s body,--the expectant dogs standing\r\nround demanding their prey--and there both beheads and betails him.\r\n"A grand old dog," he says to those around him. "I know him well. It\r\nwas he who took us that day from Poulnarer, through Castlecor, and\r\nright away to Drumcollogher." And then he throws the heavy carcass\r\nto the hungry hounds. And so could Mr. Prendergast have delivered up\r\neither of the Molletts to be devoured by the dogs of the law; but he\r\ndid not the less love them tenderly while they were yet running.\r\n\r\nAnd so he sat with the letter in his hand, smiling to think that the\r\nfather and son had come to grief among themselves; smiling also at\r\nthe dodge by which, as he thought most probable, Aby Mollett was\r\nstriving to injure the man who had kicked him, and raise a little\r\nmoney for his own private needs. There was too much earnestness in\r\nthat prayer for cash to leave Mr. Prendergast in any doubt as to\r\nAby\'s trust that money would be forthcoming. There must be something\r\nin the dodge, or Aby would not have had such trust.\r\n\r\nAnd the lawyer felt that he might, perhaps, be inclined to give some\r\nlittle assistance to poor Aby in the soreness of his needs. Foxes\r\nwill not do well in any country which is not provided with their\r\nnatural food. Rats they eat, and if rats be plentiful it is so far\r\ngood. But one should not begrudge them occasional geese and turkeys,\r\nor even break one\'s heart if they like a lamb in season. A fox will\r\nalways run well when he has come far from home seeking his breakfast.\r\n\r\nPoor Aby, when he had been so cruelly treated by the "gent of Appy\r\nouse," whose side in the family dispute he had latterly been so\r\nanxious to take, had remained crouching for some hour or two in\r\nOwen\'s kitchen, absolutely mute. The servants there for a while felt\r\nsure that he was dying; but in their master\'s present mood they did\r\nnot dare to go near him with any such tidings. And then when the\r\nhounds were gone, and the place was again quiet, Aby gradually roused\r\nhimself, allowed them to wash the blood from his hands and face, to\r\nrestore him to life by whisky and scraps of food, and gradually got\r\nhimself into his car, and so back to the Kanturk Hotel, in South Main\r\nStreet, Cork.\r\n\r\nBut, alas, his state there was more wretched by far than it had\r\nbeen in the Hap House kitchen. That his father had fled was no more\r\nthan he expected. Each had known that the other would now play some\r\nseparate secret game. But not the less did he complain loudly when he\r\nheard that "his guvnor" had not paid the bill, and had left neither\r\nmoney nor message for him. How Fanny had scorned and upbraided him,\r\nand ordered Tom to turn him out of the house "neck and crop;" how he\r\nhad squared at Tom, and ultimately had been turned out of the house\r\n"neck and crop,"--whatever that may mean--by Fanny\'s father, needs\r\nnot here to be particularly narrated. With much suffering and many\r\nprivations--such as foxes in their solitary wanderings so often\r\nknow--he did find his way to London; and did, moreover, by means of\r\nsuch wiles as foxes have, find out something as to his "guvnor\'s"\r\nwhereabouts, and some secrets also as to his "guvnor" which his\r\n"guvnor" would fain have kept to himself had it been possible. And\r\nthen, also, he again found for himself a sort of home--or hole\r\nrather--in his old original gorse covert of London; somewhere among\r\nthe Jews we may surmise, from the name of the row from which he\r\ndated; and here, setting to work once more with his usual cunning\r\nindustry,--for your fox is very industrious,--he once more attempted\r\nto build up a slender fortune by means of the "Fitsjerral" family.\r\nThe grand days in which he could look for the hand of the fair\r\nEmmeline were all gone by; but still the property had been too good\r\nnot to leave something for which he might grasp. Properly worked, by\r\nhimself alone, as he said to himself, it might still yield him some\r\ncomfortable returns, especially as he should be able to throw over\r\nthat "confouned old guvnor of his."\r\n\r\nHe remained at home the whole of the day after his letter was\r\nwritten, indeed for the next three days, thinking that Mr.\r\nPrendergast would come to him, or send for him; but Mr. Prendergast\r\ndid neither the one nor the other. Mr. Prendergast took his advice\r\ninstead, and putting himself into a Hansom cab, had himself driven to\r\n"Centbotollfs intheheast."\r\n\r\nSpinny Lane, St. Botolph\'s in the East, when at last it was found,\r\nwas not exactly the sort of place that Mr. Prendergast had expected.\r\nIt must be known that he did not allow the cabman to drive him up to\r\nthe very door indicated, nor even to the lane itself; but contented\r\nhimself with leaving the cab at St. Botolph\'s church. The huntsman in\r\nlooking after his game is as wily as the fox himself. Men do not talk\r\nat the covert side--or at any rate they ought not. And they should\r\nstand together discreetly at the non-running side. All manner of\r\nwiles and silences and discretions are necessary, though too often\r\nbroken through by the uninstructed,--much to their own discomfort.\r\nAnd so in hunting his fox, Mr. Prendergast did not dash up loudly\r\ninto the covert, but discreetly left his cab at the church of St.\r\nBotolph\'s.\r\n\r\nSpinny Lane, when at last found by intelligence given to him at the\r\nbaker\'s,--never in such unknown regions ask a lad in the street, for\r\nhe invariably will accompany you, talking of your whereabouts very\r\nloudly, so that people stare at you, and ask each other what can\r\npossibly be your business in those parts. Spinny Lane, I say, was not\r\nthe sort of locality that he had expected. He knew the look of the\r\nhalf-protected, half-condemned Alsatias of the present-day rascals,\r\nand Spinny Lane did not at all bear their character. It was a street\r\nof small new tenements, built, as yet, only on one side of the\r\nway, with the pavement only one third finished, and the stones in\r\nthe road as yet unbroken and untrodden. Of such streets there are\r\nthousands now round London. They are to be found in every suburb,\r\ncreating wonder in all thoughtful minds as to who can be their\r\ntens of thousands of occupants. The houses are a little too good\r\nfor artisans, too small and too silent to be the abode of various\r\nlodgers, and too mean for clerks who live on salaries. They are as\r\ndull-looking as Lethe itself, dull and silent, dingy and repulsive.\r\nBut they are not discreditable in appearance, and never have that\r\nMohawk look which by some unknown sympathy in bricks and mortar\r\nattaches itself to the residences of professional ruffians.\r\n\r\nNumber seven he found to be as quiet and decent a house as any in\r\nthe row, and having inspected it from a little distance he walked up\r\nbriskly to the door, and rang the bell. He walked up briskly in order\r\nthat his advance might not be seen; unless, indeed, as he began to\r\nthink not impossible, Aby\'s statement was altogether a hoax.\r\n\r\n"Does a woman named Mrs. Mary Swan live here?" he asked of a\r\ndecent-looking young woman of some seven or eight and twenty, who\r\nopened the door for him. She was decent looking, but poverty stricken\r\nand wan with work and care, and with that heaviness about her which\r\nperpetual sorrow always gives. Otherwise she would not have been ill\r\nfeatured; and even as it was she was feminine and soft in her gait\r\nand manner. "Does Mrs. Mary Swan live here?" asked Mr. Prendergast in\r\na mild voice.\r\n\r\nShe at once said Mrs. Mary Swan did live there; but she stood with\r\nthe door in her hand by no means fully opened, as though she did not\r\nwish to ask him to enter; and yet there was nothing in her tone to\r\nrepel him. Mr. Prendergast at once felt that he was on the right\r\nscent, and that it behoved him at any rate to make his way into\r\nthat house; for if ever a modest-looking daughter was like an\r\nimmodest-looking father, that young woman was like Mr. Mollett\r\nsenior.\r\n\r\n"Then I will see her, if you please," said Mr. Prendergast, entering\r\nthe passage without her invitation. Not that he pushed in with\r\nroughness; but she receded before the authority of his tone, and\r\nobeyed the command which she read in his eye. The poor young woman\r\nhesitated as though it had been her intention to declare that Mrs.\r\nSwan was not within; but if so, she had not strength to carry out her\r\npurpose, for in the next moment Mr. Prendergast found himself in the\r\npresence of the woman he had come to seek.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Mary Swan?" said Mr. Prendergast, asking a question as to her\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, that is my name," said a sickly-looking elderly woman,\r\nrising from her chair.\r\n\r\nThe room in which the two had been sitting was very poor; but\r\nnevertheless it was neat, and arranged with some attention to\r\nappearance. It was not carpeted, but there was a piece of drugget\r\nsome three yards long spread before the fireplace. The wall had been\r\npapered from time to time with scraps of different coloured paper, as\r\nopportunity offered. The table on which the work of the two women was\r\nlying was very old and somewhat rickety, but it was of mahogany; and\r\nMrs. Mary Swan herself was accommodated with a high-backed arm-chair,\r\nwhich gave some appearance of comfort to her position. It was now\r\nspring; but they had a small, very small fire in the small grate,\r\non which a pot had been placed in hopes that it might be induced\r\nto boil. All these things did the eye of Mr. Prendergast take in;\r\nbut the fact which his eye took in with its keenest glance was\r\nthis,--that on the other side of the fire to that on which sat Mrs.\r\nMary Swan, there was a second arm-chair standing close over the\r\nfender, an ordinary old mahogany chair, in which it was evident that\r\nthe younger woman had not been sitting. Her place had been close to\r\nthe table-side, where her needles and thread were still lying. But\r\nthe arm-chair was placed idly away from any accommodation for work,\r\nand had, as Mr. Prendergast thought, been recently filled by some\r\nidle person.\r\n\r\nThe woman who rose from her chair as she declared herself to be Mary\r\nSwan was old and sickly looking, but nevertheless there was that\r\nabout her which was prepossessing. Her face was thin and delicate and\r\npale, and not hard and coarse; her voice was low, as a woman\'s should\r\nbe, and her hands were white and small. Her clothes, though very\r\npoor, were neat, and worn as a poor lady might have worn them. Though\r\nthere was in her face an aspect almost of terror as she owned to\r\nher name in the stranger\'s presence, yet there was also about her a\r\ncertain amount of female dignity, which made Mr. Prendergast feel\r\nthat it behoved him to treat her not only with gentleness, but also\r\nwith respect.\r\n\r\n"I want to say a few words to you," said he, "in consequence of a\r\nletter I have received; perhaps you will allow me to sit down for a\r\nminute or two."\r\n\r\n"Certainly, sir, certainly. This is my daughter, Mary Swan; do you\r\nwish that she should leave the room, sir?" And Mary Swan, as her\r\nmother spoke, got up and prepared to depart quietly.\r\n\r\n"By no means, by no means," said Mr. Prendergast, putting his hand\r\nout so as to detain her. "I would much rather that she should remain,\r\nas it may be very likely that she may assist me in my inquiries. You\r\nwill know who I am, no doubt, when I mention my name; Mr. Mollett\r\nwill have mentioned me to you--I am Mr. Prendergast."\r\n\r\n"No, sir, he never did," said Mrs. Swan.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Mr. Prendergast, having ascertained that Mr. Mollett was\r\nat any rate well known at No. 7 Spinny Lane. "I thought that he might\r\nprobably have done so. He is at home at present, I believe?"\r\n\r\n"Sir?" said Mary Swan senior.\r\n\r\n"Your father is at home, I believe?" said Mr. Prendergast, turning to\r\nthe younger woman.\r\n\r\n"Sir?" said Mary Swan junior. It was clear at any rate that the women\r\nwere not practised liars, for they could not bring themselves on the\r\nspur of the moment to deny that he was in the house.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast did not wish to be confronted at present with Matthew\r\nMollett. Such a step might or might not be desirable before the\r\ntermination of the interview; but at the present moment he thought\r\nthat he might probably learn more from the two women as they were\r\nthan he would do if Mollett were with them.\r\n\r\nIt had been acknowledged to him that Mollett was living in that\r\nhouse, that he was now at home, and also that the younger woman\r\npresent before him was the child of Mollett and of Mary Swan the\r\nelder. That the young woman was older than Herbert Fitzgerald, and\r\nthat therefore the connection between Mollett and her mother must\r\nhave been prior to that marriage down in Dorsetshire, he was sure;\r\nbut then it might still be possible that there had been no marriage\r\nbetween Mollett and Mary Swan. If he could show that they had been\r\nman and wife when that child was born, then would his old friend Mr.\r\nDie lose his new pupil.\r\n\r\n"I have a letter in my pocket, Mrs. Swan, from Abraham Mollett--" Mr.\r\nPrendergast commenced, pulling out the letter in question.\r\n\r\n"He is nothing to me, sir," said the woman, almost in a tone of\r\nanger. "I know nothing whatever about him."\r\n\r\n"So I should have supposed from the respectability of your\r\nappearance, if I may be allowed to say so."\r\n\r\n"Nothing at all, sir; and as for that, we do try to keep ourselves\r\nrespectable. But this is a very hard world for some people to live\r\nin. It has been very hard to me and this poor girl here."\r\n\r\n"It is a hard world to some people, and to some honest people,\r\ntoo,--which is harder still."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve always tried to be honest," said Mary Swan the elder.\r\n\r\n"I am sure you have; and permit me to say, madam, that you will find\r\nit at the last to be the best policy;--at the last, even as far as\r\nthis world is concerned. But about this letter--I can assure you that\r\nI have never thought of identifying you with Abraham Mollett."\r\n\r\n"His mother was dead, sir, before ever I set eyes on him or his\r\nfather; and though I tried to do my--" and then she stopped herself\r\nsuddenly. Honesty might be the best policy, but, nevertheless, was it\r\nnecessary that she should tell everything to this stranger?\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; Abraham\'s mother was dead before you were married," said\r\nMr. Prendergast, hunting his fox ever so craftily,--his fox whom he\r\nknew to be lying in ambush up stairs. It was of course possible that\r\nold Mollett should slip away out of the back door and over a wall. If\r\nfoxes did not do those sort of things they would not be worth half\r\nthe attention that is paid to them. But Mr. Prendergast was well on\r\nthe scent; all that a sportsman wants is good scent. He would rather\r\nnot have a view till the run comes to its close. "But," continued\r\nMr. Prendergast, "it is necessary that I should say a few words to\r\nyou about this letter. Abraham\'s mother was, I suppose, not exactly\r\nan--an educated woman?"\r\n\r\n"I never saw her, sir."\r\n\r\n"She died when he was very young?"\r\n\r\n"Four years old, sir."\r\n\r\n"And her son hardly seems to have had much education?"\r\n\r\n"It was his own fault, sir; I sent him to school when he came to me,\r\nthough, goodness knows, sir, I was short enough of means of doing so.\r\nHe had better opportunities than my own daughter there; and though I\r\nsay it myself, who ought not to say it, she is a good scholar."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure she is,--and a very good young woman too, if I can judge by\r\nher appearance. But about this letter. I am afraid your husband has\r\nnot been so particular in his way of living as he should have been."\r\n\r\n"What could I do, sir? a poor weak woman!"\r\n\r\n"Nothing; what you could do, I\'m sure you did do."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always kept a house over my head, though it\'s very humble, as\r\nyou see, sir. And he has had a morsel to eat and a cup to drink of\r\nwhen he has come here. It is not often that he has troubled me this\r\nmany years past."\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Mary Swan the younger, "the gentleman won\'t care to\r\nknow about, about all that between you and father."\r\n\r\n"Ah, but it is just what I do care to know."\r\n\r\n"But, sir, father perhaps mightn\'t choose it." The obedience of women\r\nto men--to those men to whom they are legally bound--is, I think,\r\nthe most remarkable trait in human nature. Nothing equals it but the\r\ninstinctive loyalty of a dog. Of course we hear of gray mares, and of\r\ngarments worn by the wrong persons. Xanthippe doubtless did live, and\r\nthe character from time to time is repeated; but the rule, I think,\r\nis as I have said.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Swan," said Mr. Prendergast, "I should think myself dishonest\r\nwere I to worm your secrets out of you, seeing that you are yourself\r\nso truthful and so respectable." Perhaps it may be thought that\r\nMr. Prendergast was a little late in looking at the matter in this\r\nlight. "But it behoves me to learn much of the early history of your\r\nhusband, who is now living with you here, and whose name, as I take\r\nit, is not Swan, but Mollett. Your maiden name probably was Swan?"\r\n\r\n"But I was honestly married, sir, in the parish church at Putney, and\r\nthat young woman was honestly born."\r\n\r\n"I am quite sure of it. I have never doubted it. But as I was\r\nsaying, I have come here for information about your husband,\r\nand I do not like to ask you questions off your guard,"--oh, Mr.\r\nPrendergast!--"and therefore I think it right to tell you, that\r\nneither I nor those for whom I am concerned have any wish to bear\r\nmore heavily than we can help upon your husband, if he will only come\r\nforward with willingness to do that which we can make him do either\r\nwillingly or unwillingly."\r\n\r\n"But what was it about Abraham\'s letter, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it does not so much signify now."\r\n\r\n"It was he sent you here, was it, sir? How has he learned where we\r\nare, Mary?" and the poor woman turned to her daughter. "The truth is,\r\nsir, he has never known anything of us for these twenty years; nor we\r\nof him. I have not set eyes on him for more than twenty years,--not\r\nthat I know of. And he never knew me by any other name than Swan, and\r\nwhen he was a child he took me for his aunt."\r\n\r\n"He hasn\'t known then that you and his father were husband and wife?"\r\n\r\n"I have always thought he didn\'t, sir. But how--"\r\n\r\nThen after all the young fox had not been so full of craft as the\r\nelder one, thought Mr. Prendergast to himself. But nevertheless, he\r\nstill liked the old fox best. There are foxes that run so uncommonly\r\nshort that you can never get a burst after them.\r\n\r\n"I suppose, Mrs. Swan," continued Mr. Prendergast, "that you have\r\nheard the name of Fitzgerald?"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman sat silent and amazed, but after a moment the daughter\r\nanswered him. "My mother, sir, would rather that you should ask her\r\nno questions."\r\n\r\n"But, my good girl, your mother, I suppose, would wish to protect\r\nyour father, and she would not wish to answer these questions in a\r\ncourt of law."\r\n\r\n"Heaven forbid!" said the poor woman.\r\n\r\n"Your father has behaved very badly to an unfortunate lady whose\r\nfriend I am, and on her behalf I must learn the truth."\r\n\r\n"He has behaved badly, sir, to a great many ladies," said Mrs. Swan,\r\nor Mrs. Mollett as we may now call her.\r\n\r\n"You are aware, are you not, that he went through a form of marriage\r\nwith this lady many years ago?" said Mr. Prendergast, almost\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\n"Let him answer for himself," said the true wife. "Mary, go up\r\nstairs, and ask your father to come down."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE FOX IN HIS EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Swan the younger hesitated a moment before she executed her\r\nmother\'s order, not saying anything, but looking doubtfully up into\r\nher mother\'s face. "Go, my dear," said the old woman, "and ask your\r\nfather to come down. It is no use denying him."\r\n\r\n"None in the least," said Mr. Prendergast; and then the daughter\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes the lawyer and the old woman sat alone, during which\r\ntime the ear of the former was keenly alive to any steps that might\r\nbe heard on the stairs or above head. Not that he would himself\r\nhave taken any active measures to prevent Mr. Mollett\'s escape,\r\nhad such an attempt been made. The woman could be a better witness\r\nfor him than the man, and there would be no fear of her running.\r\nNevertheless, he was anxious that Mollett should, of his own accord,\r\ncome into his presence.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to keep you so long waiting, sir," said Mrs. Swan.\r\n\r\n"It does not signify. I can easily understand that your husband\r\nshould wish to reflect a little before he speaks to me. I can forgive\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"And, sir--"\r\n\r\n"Well, Mrs. Mollett?"\r\n\r\n"Are you going to do anything to punish him, sir? If a poor woman may\r\nventure to speak a word, I would beg you on my bended knees to be\r\nmerciful to him. If you would forgive him now I think he would live\r\nhonest, and be sorry for what he has done."\r\n\r\n"He has worked terrible evil," said Mr. Prendergast solemnly. "Do you\r\nknow that he has harassed a poor gentleman into his grave?"\r\n\r\n"Heaven be merciful to him!" said the poor woman. "But, sir, was not\r\nthat his son? Was it not Abraham Mollett who did that? Oh, sir, if\r\nyou will let a poor wife speak, it is he that has been worse than his\r\nfather."\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Prendergast had made up his mind how he would answer her,\r\nhe heard the sound of footsteps slowly descending upon the stairs.\r\nThey were those of a person who stepped heavily and feebly, and it\r\nwas still a minute before the door was opened.\r\n\r\n"Sir," said the woman. "Sir," and as she spoke she looked eagerly\r\ninto his face--"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that\r\ntrespass against us. We should all remember that, sir."\r\n\r\n"True, Mrs. Mollett, quite true;" and Mr. Prendergast rose from his\r\nchair as the door opened.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Mr. Prendergast and Matthew Mollett\r\nhad met once before, in the room usually occupied by Sir Thomas\r\nFitzgerald. On that occasion Mr. Mollett had at any rate entered the\r\nchamber with some of the prestige of power about him. He had come\r\nto Castle Richmond as the man having the whip hand; and though his\r\ncourage had certainly fallen somewhat before he left it, nevertheless\r\nhe had not been so beaten down but what he was able to say a word or\r\ntwo for himself. He had been well in health and decent in appearance,\r\nand even as he left the room had hardly realized the absolute ruin\r\nwhich had fallen upon him.\r\n\r\nBut now he looked as though he had realized it with sufficient\r\nclearness. He was lean and sick and pale, and seemed to be ten years\r\nolder than when Mr. Prendergast had last seen him. He was wrapped in\r\nan old dressing-gown, and had a night-cap on his head, and coughed\r\nviolently before he got himself into his chair. It is hard for any\r\ntame domestic animal to know through what fire and water a poor fox\r\nis driven as it is hunted from hole to hole and covert to covert. It\r\nis a wonderful fact, but no less a fact, that no men work so hard\r\nand work for so little pay as scoundrels who strive to live without\r\nany work at all, and to feed on the sweat of other men\'s brows. Poor\r\nMatthew Mollett had suffered dire misfortune, had encountered very\r\nhard lines, betwixt that day on which he stole away from the Kanturk\r\nHotel in South Main Street, Cork, and that other day on which he\r\npresented himself, cold and hungry and almost sick to death, at the\r\ndoor of his wife\'s house in Spinny Lane, St. Botolph\'s in the East.\r\n\r\nHe never showed himself there unless when hard pressed indeed, and\r\nthen he would skulk in, seeking for shelter and food, and pleading\r\nwith bated voice his husband right to assistance and comfort. Nor was\r\nhis plea ever denied him.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion he had arrived in very bad plight indeed: he had\r\nbrought away from Cork nothing but what he could carry on his body,\r\nand had been forced to pawn what he could pawn in order that he might\r\nsubsist And then he had been taken with ague, and with the fit strong\r\non him had crawled away to Spinny Lane, and had there been nursed by\r\nthe mother and daughter whom he had ill used, deserted, and betrayed.\r\n"When the devil was sick the devil a monk would be;" and now his\r\nwife, credulous as all women are in such matters, believed the\r\ndevil\'s protestations. A time may perhaps come when even-- But\r\nstop!--or I may chance to tread on the corns of orthodoxy. What I\r\nmean to insinuate is this; that it was on the cards that Mr. Mollett\r\nwould now at last turn over a new leaf.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Mr. Mollett?" said Mr. Prendergast. "I am sorry to\r\nsee you looking so poorly."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I am poorly enough certainly. I have been very ill since\r\nI last had the pleasure of seeing you, sir."\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes, that was at Castle Richmond; was it not? Well, you have\r\ndone the best thing that a man can do; you have come home to your\r\nwife and family now that you are ill and require their attendance."\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett looked up at him with a countenance full of unutterable\r\nwoe and weakness. What was he to say on such a subject in such a\r\ncompany? There sat his wife and daughter, his veritable wife and\r\ntrue-born daughter, on whom he was now dependent, and in whose hands\r\nhe lay, as a sick man does lie in the hands of women: could he deny\r\nthem? And there sat the awful Mr. Prendergast, the representative\r\nof all that Fitzgerald interest which he had so wronged, and who up\r\nto this morning had at any rate believed the story with which he,\r\nMollett, had pushed his fortunes in county Cork. Could he in his\r\npresence acknowledge that Lady Fitzgerald had never been his wife? It\r\nmust be confessed that he was in a sore plight. And then remember his\r\nague!\r\n\r\n"You feel yourself tolerably comfortable, I suppose, now that you are\r\nwith your wife and daughter," continued Mr. Prendergast, most\r\ninhumanly.\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett continued to look at him so piteously from beneath his\r\nnightcap. "I am better than I was, thank you, sir," said he.\r\n\r\n"There is nothing like the bosom of one\'s family for restoring one to\r\nhealth; is there, Mrs. Mollett;--or for keeping one in health?"\r\n\r\n"I wish you gentlemen would think so," said she, drily.\r\n\r\n"As for me, I never was blessed with a wife. When I am sick I have to\r\ntrust to hired attendance. In that respect I am not so fortunate as\r\nyour husband; I am only an old bachelor."\r\n\r\n"Oh, ain\'t you, sir?" said Mrs. Mollett; "and perhaps it\'s best so.\r\nIt ain\'t all married people that are the happiest."\r\n\r\nThe daughter during this time was sitting intent on her work, not\r\nlifting her face from the shirt she was sewing. But an observer might\r\nhave seen from her forehead and eye that she was not only listening\r\nto what was said, but thinking and meditating on the scene before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Mollett," said Mr. Prendergast, "you at any rate are not\r\nan old bachelor." Mr. Mollett still looked piteously at him, but said\r\nnothing. It may be thought that in all this Mr. Prendergast was more\r\ncruel than necessary, but it must be remembered that it was incumbent\r\non him to bring the poor wretch before him down absolutely on his\r\nmarrow-bones. Mollett must be made to confess his sin, and own that\r\nthis woman before him was his real wife; and the time for mercy had\r\nnot commenced till that had been done.\r\n\r\nAnd then his daughter spoke, seeing how things were going with him.\r\n"Father," said she, "this gentleman has called because he has had a\r\nletter from Abraham Mollett; and he was speaking about what Abraham\r\nhas been doing in Ireland."\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, oh dear!" said poor Mollett. "The unfortunate young man;\r\nthat wretched, unfortunate, young man! He will bring me to the grave\r\nat last--to the grave at last."\r\n\r\n"Come, Mr. Mollett," said Mr. Prendergast, now getting up and\r\nstanding with his back to the fire, "I do not know that you and I\r\nneed beat about the bush much longer. I suppose I may speak openly\r\nbefore these ladies as to what has been taking place in county Cork."\r\n\r\n"Sir!" said Mr. Mollett, with a look of deprecation about his mouth\r\nthat ought to have moved the lawyer\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I know nothing about it," said Mrs. Mollett, very stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mother, we do know something about it; and the gentleman may\r\nspeak out if it so pleases him. It will be better, father, for you\r\nthat he should do so."\r\n\r\n"Very well, my dear," said Mr. Mollett, in the lowest possible voice;\r\n"whatever the gentleman likes--only I do hope--" and he uttered a\r\ndeep sigh, and gave no further expression to his hopes or wishes.\r\n\r\n"I presume, in the first place," began Mr. Prendergast, "that this\r\nlady here is your legal wife, and this younger lady your legitimate\r\ndaughter? There is no doubt I take it as to that?"\r\n\r\n"Not--any--doubt--in the world, sir," said the Mrs. Mollett, who\r\nclaimed to be so de jure. "I have got my marriage lines to show, sir.\r\nAbraham\'s mother was dead just six months before we came together;\r\nand then we were married just six months after that."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. Mollett; I suppose you do not wish to contradict that?"\r\n\r\n"He can\'t, sir, whether he wish it or not," said Mrs. Mollett.\r\n\r\n"Could you show me that--that marriage certificate?" asked Mr.\r\nPrendergast.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mollett looked rather doubtful as to this. It may be, that much\r\nas she trusted in her husband\'s reform, she did not wish to let him\r\nknow where she kept this important palladium of her rights.\r\n\r\n"It can be forthcoming, sir, whenever it may be wanted," said Mary\r\nMollett the younger; and then Mr. Prendergast, seeing what was\r\npassing through the minds of the two women, did not press that matter\r\nany further.\r\n\r\n"But I should be glad to hear from your own lips, Mr. Mollett, that\r\nyou acknowledge the marriage, which took place at--at Fulham, I think\r\nyou said, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"At Putney, sir; at Putney parish church, in the year of our Lord\r\neighteen hundred and fourteen."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that was the year before Mr. Mollett went into Dorsetshire."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. He didn\'t stay with me long, not at that time. He went\r\naway and left me; and then all that happened, that you know of--down\r\nin Dorsetshire, as they told me. And afterwards when he went away on\r\nhis keeping, leaving Aby behind, I took the child, and said that I\r\nwas his aunt. There were reasons then; and I feared-- But never mind\r\nabout that, sir; for anything that I was wrong enough to say then\r\nto the contrary, I am his lawful wedded wife, and before my face he\r\nwon\'t deny it. And then when he was sore pressed and in trouble he\r\ncame back to me, and after that Mary here was born; and one other, a\r\nboy, who, God rest him, has gone from these troubles. And since that\r\nit is not often that he has been with me. But now, now that he is\r\nhere, you should have pity on us, and give him another chance."\r\n\r\nBut still Mr. Mollett had said nothing himself. He sat during\r\nall this time, wearily moving his head to and fro, as though the\r\nconversation were anything but comfortable to him. And, indeed, it\r\ncannot be presumed to have been very pleasant. He moved his head\r\nslowly and wearily to and fro; every now and then lifting up one hand\r\nweakly, as though deprecating any recurrence to circumstances so\r\ndecidedly unpleasant. But Mr. Prendergast was determined that he\r\nshould speak.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Mollett," said he, "I must beg you to say in so many words,\r\nwhether the statement of this lady is correct or is incorrect. Do you\r\nacknowledge her for your lawful wife?"\r\n\r\n"He daren\'t deny me, sir," said the woman, who was, perhaps, a little\r\ntoo eager in the matter.\r\n\r\n"Father, why don\'t you behave like a man and speak?" said his\r\ndaughter, now turning upon him. "You have done ill to all of us;--to\r\nso many; but now--"\r\n\r\n"And are you going to turn against me, Mary?" he whined out, almost\r\ncrying.\r\n\r\n"Turn against you! no, I have never done that. But look at mother.\r\nWould you let that gentleman think that she is--what I won\'t name\r\nbefore him? Will you say that I am not your honest-born child? You\r\nhave done very wickedly, and you must now make what amends is in your\r\npower. If you do not answer him here he will make you answer in some\r\nworse place than this."\r\n\r\n"What is it I am to say, sir?" he whined out again.\r\n\r\n"Is this lady here your legal wife?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said the poor man, whimpering.\r\n\r\n"And that marriage ceremony which you went through in Dorsetshire\r\nwith Miss Wainwright was not a legal marriage?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose not, sir."\r\n\r\n"You were well aware at the time that you were committing bigamy?"\r\n\r\n"Sir!"\r\n\r\n"You knew, I say, that you were committing bigamy; that the child\r\nwhom you were professing to marry would not become your wife through\r\nthat ceremony. I say that you knew all this at the time? Come, Mr.\r\nMollett, answer me, if you do not wish me to have you dragged out of\r\nthis by a policeman and taken at once before a magistrate."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir! be merciful to us; pray be merciful to us," said Mrs.\r\nMollett, holding up her apron to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Father, why don\'t you speak out plainly to the gentleman? He will\r\nforgive you, if you do that."\r\n\r\n"Am I to criminate myself, sir?" said Mr. Mollett, still in the\r\nhumblest voice in the world, and hardly above his breath.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this fox had still some running left in him, Mr.\r\nPrendergast thought to himself. He was not even yet so thoroughly\r\nbeaten but what he had a dodge or two remaining at his service. "Am\r\nI to criminate myself, sir?" he asked, as innocently as a child might\r\nask whether or no she were to stand longer in the corner.\r\n\r\n"You may do as you like about that, Mr. Mollett," said the lawyer; "I\r\nam neither a magistrate nor a policeman; and at the present moment I\r\nam not acting even as a lawyer. I am the friend of a family whom you\r\nhave misused and defrauded most outrageously. You have killed the\r\nfather of that family--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, gracious!" said Mrs. Mollett.\r\n\r\n"Yes, madam, he has done so; and nearly broken the heart of that poor\r\nlady, and driven her son from the house which is his own. You have\r\ndone all this in order that you might swindle them out of money for\r\nyour vile indulgences, while you left your own wife and your own\r\nchild to starve at home. In the whole course of my life I never came\r\nacross so mean a scoundrel; and now you chaffer with me as to whether\r\nor no you shall criminate yourself! Scoundrel and villain as you\r\nare--a double-dyed scoundrel, still there are reasons why I shall not\r\nwish to have you gibbeted, as you deserve."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, he has done nothing that would come to that!" said the poor\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n"You had better let the gentleman finish," said the daughter. "He\r\ndoesn\'t mean that father will be hung."\r\n\r\n"It would be too good for him," said Mr. Prendergast, who was now\r\nabsolutely almost out of temper. "But I do not wish to be his\r\nexecutioner. For the peace of that family which you have so brutally\r\nplundered and ill used, I shall remain quiet,--if I can attain my\r\nobject without a public prosecution. But, remember, that I guarantee\r\nnothing to you. For aught I know you may be in gaol before the night\r\nis come. All I have to tell you is this, that if by obtaining a\r\nconfession from you I am able to restore my friends to their property\r\nwithout a prosecution, I shall do so. Now you may answer me or not,\r\nas you like."\r\n\r\n"Trust him, father," said the daughter. "It will be best for you."\r\n\r\n"But I have told him everything," said Mollett. "What more does he\r\nwant of me?"\r\n\r\n"I want you to give your written acknowledgment that when you\r\nwent through that ceremony of marriage with Miss Wainwright in\r\nDorsetshire, you committed bigamy, and that you knew at that time\r\nthat you were doing so."\r\n\r\nMr. Mollett, as a matter of course, gave him the written document,\r\nand then Mr. Prendergast took his leave, bowing graciously to the two\r\nwomen, and not deigning to cast his eyes again on the abject wretch\r\nwho crouched by the fire.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be hard on a poor creature who has fallen so low," said Mrs.\r\nMollett as he left the room. But Mary Mollett junior followed him to\r\nthe door and opened it for him. "Sir," she said, addressing him with\r\nsome hesitation as he was preparing to depart.\r\n\r\n"Well, Miss Mollett; if I could do anything for you it would gratify\r\nme, for I sincerely feel for you,--both for you and for your mother."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir; I don\'t know that there is anything you can do for\r\nus--except to spare him. The thief on the cross was forgiven, sir."\r\n\r\n"But the thief on the cross repented."\r\n\r\n"And who shall say that he does not repent? You cannot tell of his\r\nheart by scripture word, as you can of that other one. But our\r\nLord has taught us that it is good to forgive the worst of sinners.\r\nTell that poor lady to think of this when she remembers him in her\r\nprayers."\r\n\r\n"I will, Miss Mollett; indeed, indeed I will;" and then as he left\r\nher he gave her his hand in token of respect. And so he walked away\r\nout of Spinny Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTHE LOBBY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast as he walked out of Spinny Lane, and back to St.\r\nBotolph\'s church, and as he returned thence again to Bloomsbury\r\nSquare in his cab, had a good deal of which to think. In the first\r\nplace it must be explained that he was not altogether self-satisfied\r\nwith the manner in which things had gone. That he would have made\r\nalmost any sacrifice to recover the property for Herbert Fitzgerald,\r\nis certainly true; and it is as true that he would have omitted no\r\npossible effort to discover all that which he had now discovered,\r\nalmost without necessity for any effort. But nevertheless he was not\r\naltogether pleased; he had made up his mind a month or two ago that\r\nLady Fitzgerald was not the lawful wife of her husband; and had come\r\nto this conclusion on, as he still thought, sufficient evidence. But\r\nnow he was proved to have been wrong; his character for shrewdness\r\nand discernment would be damaged, and his great ally and chum Mr.\r\nDie, the Chancery barrister, would be down on him with unmitigated\r\nsarcasm. A man who has been right so frequently as Mr. Prendergast,\r\ndoes not like to find that he is ever in the wrong. And then, had his\r\ndecision not have been sudden, might not the life of that old baronet\r\nhave been saved?\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast could not help feeling this in some degree as he\r\ndrove away to Bloomsbury Square; but nevertheless he had also the\r\nfeeling of having achieved a great triumph. It was with him as with a\r\nman who has made a fortune when he has declared to his friends that\r\nhe should infallibly be ruined. It piques him to think how wrong he\r\nhas been in his prophecy; but still it is very pleasant to have made\r\none\'s fortune.\r\n\r\nWhen he found himself at the top of Chancery Lane in Holborn, he\r\nstopped his cab and got out of it. He had by that time made up his\r\nmind as to what he would do; so he walked briskly down to Stone\r\nBuildings, and nodding to the old clerk, with whom he was very\r\nintimate, asked if he could see Mr. Die. It was his second visit to\r\nthose chambers that morning, seeing that he had been there early in\r\nthe day, introducing Herbert to his new Gamaliel. "Yes, Mr. Die is\r\nin," said the clerk, smiling; and so Mr. Prendergast passed on into\r\nthe well-known dingy temple of the Chancery god himself.\r\n\r\nThere he remained for full an hour, a message in the meanwhile having\r\nbeen sent out to Herbert Fitzgerald, begging him not to leave the\r\nchambers till he should have seen Mr. Die; "and your friend Mr.\r\nPrendergast is with him," said the clerk. "A very nice gentleman is\r\nMr. Prendergast, uncommon clever too; but it seems to me that he\r\nnever can hold his own when he comes across our Mr. Die."\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hour Herbert was summoned into the sanctum, and\r\nthere he found Mr. Die sitting in his accustomed chair, with his body\r\nmuch bent, nursing the calf of his leg, which was always enveloped in\r\na black, well-fitting close pantaloon, and smiling very blandly. Mr.\r\nPrendergast had in his countenance not quite so sweet an aspect. Mr.\r\nDie had repeated to him, perhaps once too often, a very well-known\r\nmotto of his; one by the aid of which he professed to have steered\r\nhimself safely through the shoals of life--himself and perhaps some\r\nothers. It was a motto which he would have loved to see inscribed\r\nover the great gates of the noble inn to which he belonged; and\r\nwhich, indeed, a few years since might have been inscribed there\r\nwith much justice. "Festin\xe2 lent\xe8," Mr. Die would say to all those\r\nwho came to him in any sort of hurry. And then when men accused him\r\nof being dilatory by premeditation, he would say no, he had always\r\nrecommended despatch. "Festin\xe2," he would say; "festin\xe2" by all\r\nmeans; but "festin\xe2 lent\xe8." The doctrine had at any rate thriven with\r\nthe teacher, for Mr. Die had amassed a large fortune.\r\n\r\nHerbert at once saw that Mr. Prendergast was a little fluttered.\r\nJudging from what he had seen of the lawyer in Ireland, he would have\r\nsaid that it was impossible to flutter Mr. Prendergast; but in truth\r\ngreatness is great only till it encounters greater greatness. Mars\r\nand Apollo are terrible and magnificent gods till one is enabled to\r\nsee them seated at the foot of Jove\'s great throne. That Apollo, Mr.\r\nPrendergast, though greatly in favour with the old Chancery Jupiter,\r\nhad now been reminded that he had also on this occasion driven\r\nhis team too fast, and been nearly as indiscreet in his own rash\r\noffering.\r\n\r\n"We are very sorry to keep you waiting here, Mr. Fitzgerald," said\r\nMr. Die, giving his hand to the young man without, however, rising\r\nfrom his chair; "especially sorry, seeing that it is your first day\r\nin harness. But your friend Mr. Prendergast thinks it as well that we\r\nshould talk over together a piece of business which does not seem as\r\nyet to be quite settled."\r\n\r\nHerbert of course declared that he had been in no hurry to go away;\r\nhe was, he said, quite ready to talk over anything; but to his mind\r\nat that moment nothing occurred more momentous than the nature of the\r\nagreement between himself and Mr. Die. There was an honorarium which\r\nit was presumed Mr. Die would expect, and which Herbert Fitzgerald\r\nhad ready for the occasion.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know how to describe what has taken place this morning\r\nsince I saw you," said Mr. Prendergast, whose features told plainly\r\nthat something more important than the honorarium was now on the\r\ntapis.\r\n\r\n"What has taken place?" said Herbert, whose mind now flew off to\r\nCastle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"Gently, gently," said Mr. Die; "in the whole course of my legal\r\nexperience,--and that now has been a very long experience,--I have\r\nnever come across so,--so singular a family history as this of yours,\r\nMr. Fitzgerald. When our friend Mr. Prendergast here, on his return\r\nfrom Ireland, first told me the whole of it, I was inclined to think\r\nthat he had formed a right and just decision--"\r\n\r\n"There can be no doubt about that," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Stop a moment, my dear sir; wait half a moment--a just decision, I\r\nsay--regarding the evidence of the facts as conclusive. But I was\r\nnot quite so certain that he might not have been a little--premature\r\nperhaps may be too strong a word--a little too assured in taking\r\nthose facts as proved."\r\n\r\n"But they were proved," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"I shall always maintain that there was ample ground to induce me to\r\nrecommend your poor father so to regard them," said Mr. Prendergast,\r\nstoutly. "You must remember that those men would instantly have been\r\nat work on the other side; indeed, one of them did attempt it."\r\n\r\n"Without any signal success, I believe," said Mr. Die.\r\n\r\n"My father thought you were quite right, Mr. Prendergast," said\r\nHerbert, with a tear forming in his eye; "and though it may be\r\npossible that the affair hurried him to his death, there was\r\nno alternative but that he should know the whole." At this Mr.\r\nPrendergast seemed to wince as he sat in his chair. "And I am sure of\r\nthis," continued Herbert, "that had he been left to the villanies of\r\nthose two men, his last days would have been much less comfortable\r\nthan they were. My mother feels that quite as strongly as I do." And\r\nthen Mr. Prendergast looked as though he were somewhat reassured.\r\n\r\n"It was a difficult crisis in which to act," said Mr. Prendergast,\r\n"and I can only say that I did so to the best of my poor judgment."\r\n\r\n"It was a difficult crisis in which to act," said Mr. Die, assenting.\r\n\r\n"But why is all this brought up now?" asked Herbert.\r\n\r\n"Festin\xe2 lent\xe8," said Mr. Die; "lent\xe8, lent\xe8 lent\xe8; always lent\xe8. The\r\nmore haste we make in trying to understand each other, with the less\r\nspeed shall we arrive at that object."\r\n\r\n"What is it, Mr. Prendergast?" again demanded Herbert, who was now\r\ntoo greatly excited to care much for the Chancery wisdom of the great\r\nbarrister. "Has anything new turned up about--about those Molletts?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Herbert, something has turned up--"\r\n\r\n"Remember, Prendergast, that your evidence is again incomplete."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, sir, I do not think it is: it would be sufficient for\r\nany intellectual jury in a Common Law court," said Mr. Prendergast,\r\nwho sometimes, behind his back, gave to Mr. Die the surname of\r\nCunctator.\r\n\r\n"But juries in Common Law courts are not always intelligent. And\r\nyou may be sure, Prendergast, that any gentleman taking up the case\r\non the other side would have as much to say for his client as your\r\ncounsel would have for yours. Remember, you have not even been to\r\nPutney yet."\r\n\r\n"Been to Putney!" said Herbert, who was becoming uneasy.\r\n\r\n"The onus probandi would lie with them," said Mr. Prendergast. "We\r\ntake possession of that which is our own till it is proved to belong\r\nto others."\r\n\r\n"You have already abandoned the possession."\r\n\r\n"No; we have done nothing already: we have taken no legal step; when\r\nwe believed--"\r\n\r\n"Having by your own act put yourself in your present position, I\r\nthink you ought to be very careful before you take up another."\r\n\r\n"Certainly we ought to be careful. But I do maintain that we may be\r\ntoo punctilious. As a matter of course I shall go to Putney."\r\n\r\n"To Putney!" said Herbert Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Herbert, and now, if Mr. Die will permit, I will tell you\r\nwhat has happened. On yesterday afternoon, before you came to dine\r\nwith me, I received that letter. No, that is from your cousin, Owen\r\nFitzgerald. You must see that also by-and-by. It was this one,--from\r\nthe younger Mollett, the man whom you saw that day in your poor\r\nfather\'s room."\r\n\r\nHerbert anxiously put out his hand for the letter, but he was again\r\ninterrupted by Mr. Die. "I beg your pardon, Mr. Fitzgerald, for a\r\nmoment. Prendergast, let me see that letter again, will you?" And\r\ntaking hold of it, he proceeded to read it very carefully, still\r\nnursing his leg with his left hand, while he held the letter with his\r\nright.\r\n\r\n"What\'s it all about?" said Herbert, appealing to Prendergast almost\r\nin a whisper.\r\n\r\n"Lent\xe8, lent\xe8, lent\xe8, my dear Mr. Fitzgerald," said Mr. Die, while\r\nhis eyes were still intent upon the paper. "If you will take\r\nadvantage of the experience of gray hairs, and bald heads,"--his\r\nown was as bald all round as a big white stone--"you must put up\r\nwith some of the disadvantages of a momentary delay. Suppose now,\r\nPrendergast, that he is acting in concert with those people in--what\r\ndo you call the street?"\r\n\r\n"In Spinny Lane."\r\n\r\n"Yes; with his father and the two women there."\r\n\r\n"What could they gain by that?"\r\n\r\n"Share with him whatever he might be able to get out of you."\r\n\r\n"The man would never accuse himself of bigamy for that. Besides, you\r\nshould have seen the women, Die."\r\n\r\n"Seen the women! Tsh--tsh--tsh; I have seen enough of them, young and\r\nold, to know that a clean apron and a humble tone and a down-turned\r\neye don\'t always go with a true tongue and an honest heart. Women are\r\nnow the most successful swindlers of the age! That profession at any\r\nrate is not closed against them."\r\n\r\n"You will not find these women to be swindlers; at least I think\r\nnot."\r\n\r\n"Ah! but we want to be sure, Prendergast;" and then Mr. Die finished\r\nthe letter, very leisurely, as Herbert thought.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished it, he folded it up and gave it back to Mr.\r\nPrendergast. "I don\'t think but what you\'ve a strong prim\xe2 facie\r\ncase; so strong that perhaps you are right to explain the whole\r\nmatter to our young friend here, who is so deeply concerned in it.\r\nBut at the same time I should caution him that the matter is still\r\nenveloped in doubt."\r\n\r\nHerbert eagerly put out his hand for the letter. "You may trust me\r\nwith it," said he: "I am not of a sanguine temperament, nor easily\r\nexcited; and you may be sure that I will not take it for more than it\r\nis worth." So saying, he at last got hold of the letter, and managed\r\nto read it through much more quickly than Mr. Die had done. As he did\r\nso he became very red in the face, and too plainly showed that he had\r\nmade a false boast in speaking of the coolness of his temperament.\r\nIndeed, the stakes were so high that it was difficult for a young man\r\nto be cool while he was playing the game: he had made up his mind to\r\nlose, and to that he had been reconciled; but now again every pulse\r\nof his heart and every nerve of his body was disturbed. "Was never\r\nhis wife," he said out loud when he got to that part of the letter.\r\n"His real wife living now in Spinny Lane! Do you believe that Mr.\r\nPrendergast?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," said the attorney.\r\n\r\n"Lent\xe8, lent\xe8, lent\xe8," said the barrister, quite oppressed by his\r\nfriend\'s unprofessional abruptness.\r\n\r\n"But I do believe it," said Mr. Prendergast: "you must always\r\nunderstand, Herbert, that this new story may possibly not be true--"\r\n\r\n"Quite possible," said Mr. Die, with something almost approaching to\r\na slight laugh.\r\n\r\n"But the evidence is so strong," continued the other, "that I do\r\nbelieve it heartily. I have been to that house, and seen the man, old\r\nMollett, and the woman whom I believe to be his wife, and a daughter\r\nwho lives with them. As far as my poor judgment goes," and he made\r\na bow of deference towards the barrister, whose face, however,\r\nseemed to say, that in his opinion the judgment of his friend Mr.\r\nPrendergast did not always go very far--"As far as my poor judgment\r\ngoes, the women are honest and respectable. The man is as great\r\na villain as there is unhung--unless his son be a greater one;\r\nbut he is now so driven into a corner, that the truth may be more\r\nserviceable to him than a lie."\r\n\r\n"People of that sort are never driven into a corner," said Mr. Die;\r\n"they may sometimes be crushed to death."\r\n\r\n"Well, I believe the matter is as I tell you. There at any rate is\r\nMollett\'s assurance that it is so. The woman has been residing in the\r\nsame place for years, and will come forward at any time to prove that\r\nshe was married to this man before he ever saw--before he went to\r\nDorsetshire: she has her marriage certificate; and as far as I can\r\nlearn there is no one able or willing to raise the question against\r\nyou. Your cousin Owen certainly will not do so."\r\n\r\n"It will hardly do to depend upon that," said Mr. Die, with another\r\nsneer. "Twelve thousand a year is a great provocative to litigation."\r\n\r\n"If he does we must fight him; that\'s all. Of course steps will be\r\ntaken at once to get together in the proper legal form all evidence\r\nof every description which may bear on the subject, so that should\r\nthe question ever be raised again, the whole matter may be in a\r\nnutshell."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find it a nutshell very difficult to crack in five-and-twenty\r\nyears\' time," said Mr. Die.\r\n\r\n"And what would you advise me to do?" asked Herbert.\r\n\r\nThat after all was now the main question, and it was discussed\r\nbetween them for a long time, till the shades of evening came upon\r\nthem, and the dull dingy chambers became almost dark as they sat\r\nthere. Mr. Die at first conceived that it would be well that Herbert\r\nshould still stick to the law. What indeed could be more conducive\r\nto salutary equanimity in the mind of a young man so singularly\r\ncircumstanced, than the study of Blackstone, of Coke, and of Chitty?\r\nas long as he remained there, at work in those chambers, amusing\r\nhimself occasionally with the eloquence of the neighbouring courts,\r\nthere might be reasonable hope that he would be able to keep his mind\r\nequally poised, so that neither success nor failure as regarded his\r\nIrish inheritance should affect him injuriously. Thus at least argued\r\nMr. Die. But at this point Herbert seemed to have views of his own:\r\nhe said that in the first place he must be with his mother; and then,\r\nin the next place, as it was now clear that he was not to throw up\r\nCastle Richmond--as it would not now behove him to allow any one else\r\nto call himself master there,--it would be his duty to reassume the\r\nplace of master. "The onus probandi will now rest with them," he\r\nsaid, repeating Mr. Prendergast\'s words; and then he was ultimately\r\nsuccessful in persuading even Mr. Die to agree that it would be\r\nbetter for him to go to Ireland than to remain in London, sipping the\r\ndelicious honey of Chancery buttercups.\r\n\r\n"And you will assume the title, I suppose?" said Mr. Die.\r\n\r\n"Not at any rate till I get to Castle Richmond," he said, blushing.\r\nHe had so completely abandoned all thought of being Sir Herbert\r\nFitzgerald, that he had now almost felt ashamed of saying that he\r\nshould so far presume as to call himself by that name.\r\n\r\nAnd then he and Mr. Prendergast went away and dined together, leaving\r\nMr. Die to complete his legal work for the day. At this he would\r\noften sit till nine or ten, or even eleven in the evening, without\r\nany apparent ill results from such effects, and then go home to his\r\ndinner and port wine. He was already nearly seventy, and work seemed\r\nto have no effect on him. In what Medea\'s caldron is it that the\r\ngreat lawyers so cook themselves, that they are able to achieve half\r\nan immortality, even while the body still clings to the soul? Mr.\r\nDie, though he would talk of his bald head, had no idea of giving\r\nway to time. Superannuated! The men who think of superannuation at\r\nsixty are those whose lives have been idle, not they who have really\r\nbuckled themselves to work. It is my opinion that nothing seasons the\r\nmind for endurance like hard work. Port wine should perhaps be added.\r\n\r\nIt was not till Herbert once more found himself alone that he fully\r\nrealized this new change in his position. He had dined with Mr.\r\nPrendergast at that gentleman\'s club, and had been specially called\r\nupon to enjoy himself, drinking as it were to his own restoration in\r\nlarge glasses of some special claret, which Mr. Prendergast assured\r\nhim was very extraordinary.\r\n\r\n"You may be as satisfied as that you are sitting there that that\'s\r\n34," said he; "and I hardly know anywhere else that you\'ll get it."\r\n\r\nThis assertion Herbert was not in the least inclined to dispute. In\r\nthe first place, he was not quite clear what 34 meant, and then any\r\nother number, 32 or 36, would have suited his palate as well. But he\r\ndrank the 34, and tried to look as though he appreciated it.\r\n\r\n"Our wines here are wonderfully cheap," said Mr. Prendergast,\r\nbecoming confidential; "but nevertheless we have raised the price of\r\nthat to twelve shillings. We\'ll have another bottle."\r\n\r\nDuring all this Herbert could hardly think of his own fate and\r\nfortune, though, indeed, he could hardly think of anything else.\r\nHe was eager to be alone, that he might think, and was nearly\r\nbroken-hearted when the second bottle of 34 made its appearance.\r\nSomething, however, was arranged in those intercalary moments between\r\nthe raising of the glasses. Mr. Prendergast said that he would write\r\nboth to Owen Fitzgerald and to Mr. Somers; and it was agreed that\r\nHerbert should immediately return to Castle Richmond, merely giving\r\nhis mother time to have notice of his coming.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last he got away, and started by himself for a night walk\r\nthrough the streets of London. It seemed to him now to be a month\r\nsince he had arrived there; but in truth it was only on the yesterday\r\nthat he had got out of the train at the Euston Station. He had come\r\nup, looking forward to live in London all his life, and now his\r\nLondon life was over,--unless, indeed, those other hopes should come\r\nback to him, unless he should appear again, not as a student in Mr.\r\nDie\'s chamber, but as one of the council of the legislature assembled\r\nto make laws for the governance of Mr. Die and of others. It was\r\nsingular how greatly this episode in his life had humbled him in his\r\nown esteem. Six months ago he had thought himself almost too good for\r\nCastle Richmond, and had regarded a seat in Parliament as the only\r\nplace which he could fitly fill without violation to his nature.\r\nBut now he felt as though he should hardly dare to show himself\r\nwithin the walls of that assembly. He had been so knocked about by\r\ncircumstances, so rudely toppled from his high place,--he had found\r\nit necessary to put himself so completely into the hands of other\r\npeople, that his self-pride had all left him. That it would in fact\r\nreturn might be held as certain, but the lesson which he had learned\r\nwould not altogether be thrown away upon him.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, as I was saying, he felt himself to be completely\r\nhumbled. A lie spoken by one of the meanest of God\'s creatures had\r\nturned him away from all his pursuits, and broken all his hopes; and\r\nnow another word from this man was to restore him,--if only that\r\nother word should not appear to be the greater lie! and then that\r\nthere should be such question as to his mother\'s name and fame--as\r\nto the very name by which she should now be called! that it should\r\ndepend on the amount of infamy of which that wretch had been guilty,\r\nwhether or no the woman whom in the world he most honoured was\r\nentitled to any share of respect from the world around her! That she\r\nwas entitled to the respect of all good men, let the truth in these\r\nmatters be where it might, Herbert knew, and all who heard the story\r\nwould acknowledge. But respect is of two sorts, and the outer respect\r\nof the world cannot be parted with conveniently.\r\n\r\nHe did acknowledge himself to be a humbled man,--more so than he had\r\never yet done, or had been like to do, while conscious of the loss\r\nwhich had fallen on him. It was at this moment when he began to\r\nperceive that his fortune would return to him, when he became aware\r\nthat he was knocked about like a shuttlecock from a battledore, that\r\nhis pride came by its first fall. Mollett was in truth the great\r\nman,--the Warwick who was to make and unmake the kings of Castle\r\nRichmond. A month ago, and it had pleased Earl Mollett to say that\r\nOwen Fitzgerald should reign; but there had been a turn upon the\r\ncards, and now he, King Herbert, was to be again installed.\r\n\r\nHe walked down all alone through St. James\'s Street, and by Pall Mall\r\nand Charing Cross, feeling rather than thinking of all this. Those\r\ndoubts of Mr. Die did not trouble him much. He fully believed that he\r\nshould regain his title and property; or rather that he should never\r\nlose them. But he thought that he could never show himself about the\r\ncountry again as he had done before all this was known. In spite of\r\nhis good fortune he was sad at heart, little conscious of the good\r\nthat all this would do him.\r\n\r\nHe went on by the Horse Guards and Treasury Chambers into Parliament\r\nStreet, and so up to the new Houses of Parliament, and sauntered into\r\nWestminster Hall; and there, at the privileged door between the lamps\r\non his left hand, he saw busy men going in and out, some slow and\r\ndignified, others hot, hasty, and anxious, and he felt as though the\r\nregions to and from which they passed must be far out of his reach.\r\nCould he aspire to pass those august lamp-posts, he whose very name\r\ndepended on what in truth might have been the early doings of a low\r\nscoundrel who was now skulking from the law?\r\n\r\nAnd then he went on, and mounting by the public stairs and anterooms\r\nfound his way to the lobby of the house. There he stood with his back\r\nto the ginger-beer stall, moody and melancholy, looking on as men in\r\nthe crowd pushed forward to speak to members whom they knew; or, as\r\nit sometimes appeared, to members whom they did not know. There was\r\nsomewhat of interest going on in the house, for the throng was thick,\r\nand ordinary men sometimes jostled themselves on into the middle of\r\nthe hall--with impious steps; for on those centre stones none but\r\nlegislators should presume to stand.\r\n\r\n"Stand back, gentlemen, stand back; back a little, if you please,\r\nsir," said a very courteous but peremptory policeman, so moving the\r\nthrong that Herbert, who had been behind, in no way anxious for a\r\nforward place, or for distinguishing nods from passing members, found\r\nhimself suddenly in the front rank, in the immediate neighbourhood of\r\na cluster of young senators who were cooling themselves in the lobby\r\nafter the ardour of the debate.\r\n\r\n"It was as pretty a thing as ever I saw in my life," said one, "and\r\nbeautifully ridden." Surely it must have been the Spring Meeting and\r\nnot the debate that they were discussing.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know much about that," said another, and the voice sounded\r\non Herbert\'s ears as it might almost be the voice of a brother. "I\r\nknow I lost the odds. But I\'ll have a bottle of soda-water. Hallo,\r\nFitzgerald! Why--;" and then the young member stopped himself, for\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald\'s story was rife about London at this time.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Moulsey?" said Herbert, very glumly, for he did not\r\nat all like being recognized. This was Lord Moulsey, the eldest\r\nson of the Earl of Hampton Court, who was now member for the River\r\nRegions, and had been one of Herbert\'s most intimate friends at\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n"I did not exactly expect to see you here," said Lord Moulsey,\r\ndrawing him apart. "And upon my soul I was never so cut up in my life\r\nas when I heard all that. Is it true?"\r\n\r\n"True! why no;--it was true, but I don\'t think it is. That is to\r\nsay--upon my word I don\'t know. It\'s all unsettled--Good evening to\r\nyou." And again nodding his head at his old friend in a very sombre\r\nmanner, he skulked off and made his way out of Westminster Hall.\r\n\r\n"Do you know who that was?" said Lord Moulsey going back to his ally.\r\n"That was young Fitzgerald, the poor fellow who has been done out\r\nof his title and all his property. You have heard about his mother,\r\nhaven\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Was that young Fitzgerald?" said the other senator, apparently more\r\ninterested in this subject than he had even been about the pretty\r\nriding. "I wish I\'d looked at him. Poor fellow! How does he bear it?"\r\n\r\n"Upon my word then, I never saw a fellow so changed in my life. He\r\nand I were like brothers, but he would hardly speak to me. Perhaps I\r\nought to have written to him. But he says it\'s not settled."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all gammon. It\'s settled enough. Why they\'ve given up the\r\nplace. I heard all about it the other day from Sullivan O\'Leary. They\r\nare not even making any fight. Sullivan O\'Leary says they are the\r\ngreatest fools in the world."\r\n\r\n"Upon my word I think young Fitzgerald was mad just now. His manner\r\nwas so very odd."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder. I know I should go mad if my mother turned out\r\nto be somebody else\'s wife." And then they both sauntered away.\r\n\r\nHerbert was doubly angry with himself as he made his way down\r\ninto the noble old hall,--angry that he had gone where there was\r\na possibility of his being recognized, and angry also that he\r\nhad behaved himself with so little presence of mind when he was\r\nrecognized. He felt that he had been taken aback, that he had been\r\nbeside himself, and unable to maintain his own dignity; he had run\r\naway from his old intimate friend because he had been unable to bear\r\nbeing looked on as the hero of a family tragedy. "He would go back\r\nto Ireland," he said to himself, "and he would never leave it again.\r\nPerhaps he might teach himself there to endure the eyes and voices of\r\nmen around him. Nothing at any rate should induce him to come again\r\nto London." And so he went home to bed in a mood by no means so happy\r\nas might have been expected from the result of the day\'s doings. And\r\nyet he had been cheerful enough when he went to Mr. Die\'s chambers in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nANOTHER JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day he did go back to Ireland, stopping a night\r\nin Dublin on the road, so that his mother might receive his letter,\r\nand that his cousin and Somers might receive those written by Mr.\r\nPrendergast. He spent one night in Dublin, and then went on, so that\r\nhe might arrive at Castle Richmond after dark. In his present mood he\r\ndreaded to be seen returning, even by his own people about the place.\r\n\r\nAt Buttevant he was met by his own car and by Richard, as he had\r\ndesired; but he found that he was utterly frustrated as to that\r\nmethod of seating himself in his vehicle which he had promised to\r\nhimself. He was still glum and gloomy enough when the coach stopped,\r\nfor he had been all alone, thinking over many things--thinking of\r\nhis father\'s death and his mother\'s early life--of all that he had\r\nsuffered and might yet have to suffer, and above all things dreading\r\nthe consciousness that men were talking of him and staring at him. In\r\nthis mood he was preparing to leave the coach when he found himself\r\napproaching near to that Buttevant stage; but he had more to go\r\nthrough at present than he expected.\r\n\r\n"There\'s his honour--Hurrah! God bless his sweet face that\'s come\r\namong us agin this day! Hurrah for Sir Herbert, boys! hurrah! The\r\nrail ould Fitzgerald \'ll be back agin among us, glory be to God and\r\nthe Blessed Virgin! Hurrah for Sir Herbert!" and then there was a\r\nshout that seemed to be repeated all down the street of Buttevant.\r\n\r\nBut that was nothing to what was coming. Herbert, when he first heard\r\nthis, retreated for a moment back into the coach. But there was\r\nlittle use in that. It was necessary that he should descend, and had\r\nhe not done so he would have been dragged out. He put his foot on the\r\nsteps, and then found himself seized in the arms of a man outside,\r\nand pressed and embraced as though he had been a baby.\r\n\r\n"Ugh, ugh, ugh!" exclaimed a voice, the owner of which intended to\r\nsend forth notes of joy; but so overcome was he by the intensity of\r\nhis own feelings that he was in nowise able to moderate his voice\r\neither for joy or sorrow. "Ugh, ugh, ugh! Eh! Sir Herbert! but it\'s I\r\nthat am proud to see yer honour this day,--wid yer ouwn name, wid yer\r\nouwn name. Glory be to God; oh dear! oh dear! And I knew the Lord\'d\r\nniver forgit us that way, and let the warld go intirely wrong like\r\nthat. For av you weren\'t the masther, Sir Herbert, as you are, the\r\nLord presarve you to us, divil a masther\'d iver be able to hould a\r\nfoot in Castle Richmond, and that\'s God\'s ouwn thruth."\r\n\r\n"And that\'s thrue for you, Richard," said another, whom Herbert in\r\nthe confusion could not recognize, though his voice was familiar to\r\nhim. "\'Deed and the boys had it all made out. But what matthers now\r\nSir Herbert\'s back?"\r\n\r\n"And God bless the day and the hour that he came to us!" And then\r\nleaving his master\'s arm and coat to which he had still stuck, he\r\nbegan to busy himself loudly about the travelling gear. "Coachman,\r\nwhere\'s Sir Herbert\'s portmantel? Yes; that\'s Sir Herbert\'s hat-box.\r\n\'Deed, an\' I ought to know it well. And the black bag; yes, that\'ll\r\nbe Sir Herbert\'s, to be sure," and so on.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. The name seemed to run like wildfire through all\r\nthe Buttevantians there assembled; and no sound seemed to reach our\r\nhero\'s name but that of Sir Herbert, Sir Herbert. Everybody took hold\r\nof him, and kissed his hand, and pulled his skirts, and stroked his\r\nface. His hat was knocked off, and put on again amid thousands of\r\nblessings. It was nearly dark, and his eyes were dazed by the coach\r\nlanterns which were carried about, so that he could hardly see his\r\nfriends; but the one sound which was dinned into his ears was that of\r\nSir Herbert, Sir Herbert.\r\n\r\nHad he thought about it when starting from Dublin early that morning\r\nhe would have said that it would have killed him to have heard\r\nhimself so greeted in the public street, but as it was he found\r\nthat he got over it very easily. Before he was well seated on his\r\ncar it may be questioned whether he was not so used to his name,\r\nthat he would have been startled to hear himself designated as Mr.\r\nFitzgerald. For half a minute he had been wretched, and had felt\r\na disgust at poor Richard which he thought at the moment would be\r\ninsuperable; but when he was on the car, and the poor fellow came\r\nround to tuck the apron in under his feet, he could not help giving\r\nhim his hand, and fraternizing with him.\r\n\r\n"And how is my mother, Richard?"\r\n\r\n"\'Deed then, Sir Herbert, me lady is surprising--very quiet-like; but\r\nher leddyship was always that, and as sweet to them as comes nigh her\r\nas flowers in May; but sure that\'s nathural to her leddyship."\r\n\r\n"And, Richard--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sir Herbert."\r\n\r\n"Was Mr. Owen over at Castle Richmond since I left?"\r\n\r\n"Sorrow a foot, Sir Herbert. Nor no one ain\'t heard on him, nor seen\r\nhim. And I will say this on him--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say anything against him, Richard."\r\n\r\n"No, surely not, seeing he is yer honour\'s far-away cousin, Sir\r\nHerbert. But what I war going to say warn\'t agin Mr. Owen at all,\r\nat all. For they do say that cart-ropes wouldn\'t have dragged him\r\nto Castle Richmond; and that only yer honour has come back to yer\r\nown,--and why not?--there wouldn\'t have been any masther in Castle\r\nRichmond at all, at all. That\'s what they do say."\r\n\r\n"There\'s no knowing how it will go yet, Richard."\r\n\r\n"\'Deed, an\' I know how it \'ll go very well, Sir Herbert, and so does\r\nMr. Somers, God bless him! \'Twas only this morning he tould me. An\',\r\nfaix, it\'s he has the right to be glad."\r\n\r\n"He is a very old friend."\r\n\r\n"So is we all ould frinds, an\' we\'re all glad--out of our skins wid\r\ngladness, Sir Herbert. \'Deed an\' I thought the eend of the warld had\r\ncome when I heerd it, for my head went round and round and round as I\r\nstood in the stable, and only for the fork I had a hould of, I\'d have\r\nbeen down among the crathur\'s legs."\r\n\r\nAnd then it struck Herbert that as they were going on he heard the\r\nfootsteps of some one running after the car, always at an equal\r\ndistance behind them. "Who\'s that running, Richard?"\r\n\r\n"Sure an\' that\'s just Larry Carson, yer honour\'s own boy, that minds\r\nyer honour\'s own nag, Sir Herbert. But, faix, I suppose ye\'ll be\r\nhaving a dozen of \'em now."\r\n\r\n"Stop and take him up; you\'ve room there."\r\n\r\n"Room enough, Sir Herbert, an\' yer honour\'s so good. Here, Larry, yer\r\nborn fool, Sir Herbert says ye\'re to get up. He would come over, Sir\r\nHerbert, just to say he\'d been the first to see yer honour."\r\n\r\n"God--bless--yer honour--Sir Herbert," exclaimed the poor fellow, out\r\nof breath, as he took his seat. It was his voice that Sir Herbert\r\nhad recognized among the crowd, angry enough at that moment. But in\r\nfuture days it was remembered in Larry Carson\'s favour, that he had\r\ncome over to Castle Richmond to see his master, contented to run the\r\nwhole road back to Castle Richmond behind the car. A better fate,\r\nhowever, was his, for he made one in the triumphal entry up the\r\navenue.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the lodge it was quite dark--so dark that even\r\nRichard, who was experienced in night-driving, declared that a cat\r\ncould not see. However, they turned in at the great gates without any\r\naccident, the accustomed woman coming out to open them.\r\n\r\n"An\' is his honour there thin?" said the woman; "and may God bless\r\nyou, Sir Herbert, and ye\'re welcome back to yer own; so ye are!"\r\n\r\nAnd then a warm large hand was laid upon his leg, and a warm voice\r\nsounded greeting in his ear. "Herbert, my boy, how are you? This is\r\nwell, is it not?" It was Mr. Somers who had been waiting there for\r\nhim at the lodge gate.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole he could not but acknowledge to himself that it was\r\nwell. Mr. Somers got up beside him on the car, so that by this time\r\nit was well laden. "And how does my mother take it?" Herbert asked.\r\n\r\n"Very quietly. Your Aunt Letty told me that she had spent most of her\r\ntime in prayer since she heard it. But Miss Letty seems to think that\r\non your account she is very full of joy."\r\n\r\n"And the girls?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! the girls--what girls? Well, they must answer for themselves; I\r\nleft them about half an hour ago, and now you hear their voices in\r\nthe porch."\r\n\r\nHe did hear the voices in the porch plainly, though he could not\r\ndistinguish them, as the horse\'s feet and the car wheels rattled over\r\nthe gravel. But as the car stopped at the door with somewhat of a\r\ncrash, he heard Emmeline say, "There\'s Herbert," and then as he got\r\ndown they all retreated in among the lights in the hall.\r\n\r\n"God bless your honour, Sir Herbert. An\' it\'s you that are welcome\r\nback this blessed night to Castle Richmond." Such and such like\r\nwere the greetings which met him from twenty different voices as\r\nhe essayed to enter the house. Every servant and groom about the\r\nplace was there, and some few of the nearest tenants,--of those who\r\nhad lived near enough to hear the glad tidings since the morning.\r\nA dozen, at any rate, took his hands as he strove to make his\r\nway through them, and though he was never quite sure about it, he\r\nbelieved that one or two had kissed him in the dark. At last he found\r\nhimself in the hall, and even then the first person who got hold of\r\nhim was Mrs. Jones.\r\n\r\n"And so you\'ve come back to us after all, Mr. Herbert--Sir Herbert\r\nI should say, begging your pardon, sir; and it\'s all right about my\r\nlady. I never thought to be so happy again, never--never--never." And\r\nthen she retreated with her apron up to her eyes, leaving him in the\r\narms of Aunt Letty.\r\n\r\n"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of\r\nthe Lord. Oh! Herbert, my darling boy. I hope this may be a lesson\r\nand a warning to you, so that you may flee from the wrath to come."\r\nAunt Letty, had time been allowed to her, would certainly have\r\nshown that the evil had all come from tampering with papistical\r\nabominations; and that the returning prosperity of the house of\r\nCastle Richmond was due to Protestant energy and truth. But much\r\ntime was not allowed to Aunt Letty, as Herbert hurried on after his\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nAs he had advanced they had retreated, and now he heard them in\r\nthe drawing-room. He began to be conscious that they were not\r\nalone,--that they had some visitor with them, and began to be\r\nconscious also who that visitor was. And when he got himself at last\r\ninto the room, sure enough there were three girls there, two running\r\nforward to meet him from the fireplace to which they had retreated,\r\nand the other lingering a little in their rear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Herbert!" and "oh, Herbert!" and then their arms were thrown\r\nabout his neck, and their warm kisses were on his cheeks--kisses not\r\nunmixed with tears; for of course they began to cry immediately that\r\nhe was with them, though their eyes had been dry enough for the two\r\nor three hours before. Their arms were about his neck, and their\r\nkisses on his cheeks, I have said,--meaning thereby the arms and\r\nkisses of his sisters, for the third young lady still lingered a\r\nlittle in the rear.\r\n\r\n"Was it not lucky Clara was here when the news came to us this\r\nmorning?" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Such difficulty as we have had to get her," said Emmeline. "It was\r\nto have been her farewell visit to us; but we will have no more\r\nfarewells now; will we, Clara?"\r\n\r\nAnd now at last he had his arm round her waist, or as near to that\r\nposition as he was destined to get it on the present occasion. She\r\ngave him her hand, and let him hold that fast, and smiled on him\r\nthrough her soft tears, and was gracious to him with her sweet words\r\nand pleasant looks; but she would not come forward and kiss him\r\nboldly as she had done when last they had met at Desmond Court.\r\nHe attempted it now; but he could get his lips no nearer to hers\r\nthan her forehead; and when he tried to hold her she slipped away\r\nfrom him, and he continually found himself in the embraces of his\r\nsisters,--which was not the same thing at all. "Never mind," he said\r\nto himself; "his day would soon come round."\r\n\r\n"You did not expect to find Clara here, did you?" asked Emmeline.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know what I have expected, or not expected, for the last\r\ntwo days. No, certainly, I had no hope of seeing her to-night."\r\n\r\n"I trust I am not in the way," said Clara.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he made another attempt with his arm, but when he thought\r\nhe had caught his prize, Emmeline was again within his grasp.\r\n\r\n"And my mother?" he then said. It must be remembered that he had only\r\nyet been in the room for three minutes, though his little efforts\r\nhave taken longer than that in the telling.\r\n\r\n"She is up stairs, and you are to go to her. But I told her that we\r\nshould keep you for a quarter of an hour, and you have not been here\r\nhalf that time yet."\r\n\r\n"And how has she borne all this?"\r\n\r\n"Why, well on the whole. When first she heard it this morning, which\r\nshe did before any of us, you know--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I wrote to her."\r\n\r\n"But your letter told her nothing. Mr. Somers came down almost\r\nas soon as your letter was here. He had heard also--from Mr.\r\nPrendergast, I think it was, and Mr. Prendergast said a great deal\r\nmore than you did."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"We thought she was going to be ill at first, for she became so very\r\npale,--flushing up sometimes for half a minute or so; but after an\r\nhour or two she became quite calm. She has seen nobody since but us\r\nand Aunt Letty."\r\n\r\n"She saw me," said Clara.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you; you are one of us now,--just the same as ourselves,\r\nisn\'t she, Herbert?"\r\n\r\nNot exactly the same, Herbert thought. And then he went up stairs to\r\nhis mother.\r\n\r\nThis interview I will not attempt to describe. Lady Fitzgerald had\r\nbecome a stricken woman from the first moment that she had heard that\r\nthat man had returned to life, who in her early girlhood had come to\r\nher as a suitor. Nay, this had been so from the first moment that she\r\nhad expected his return. And these misfortunes had come upon her so\r\nquickly that, though they had not shattered her in body and mind as\r\nthey had shattered her husband, nevertheless they had told terribly\r\non her heart. The coming of those men, the agony of Sir Thomas, the\r\ntelling of the story as it had been told to her by Mr. Prendergast,\r\nthe resolve to abandon everything--even a name by which she might\r\nbe called, as far as she herself was concerned, the death of her\r\nhusband, and then the departure of her ruined son, had, one may say,\r\nbeen enough to destroy the spirit of any woman. Her spirit they had\r\nnot utterly destroyed. Her powers of endurance were great,--and she\r\nhad endured, still hoping. But as the uttermost malice of adversity\r\nhad not been able altogether to depress her, so neither did returning\r\nprosperity exalt her,--as far as she herself was concerned. She\r\nrejoiced for her children greatly, thanking God that she had not\r\nentailed on them an existence without a name. But for herself, as\r\nshe now told Herbert, outside life was all over. Her children and\r\nthe poor she might still have with her, but beyond, nothing in this\r\nworld;--to them would be confined all her wishes on this side the\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless she could be warm in her greetings to her son. She\r\ncould understand that though she were dead to the world he need not\r\nbe so,--nor indeed ought to be so. Things that were now all ending\r\nwith her were but beginning with him. She had no feeling that taught\r\nher to think that it was bad for him to be a man of rank and fortune,\r\nthe head of his family, and the privileged one of his race. It had\r\nbeen perhaps her greatest misery that she, by her doing, had placed\r\nhim in the terrible position which he had lately been called upon to\r\nfill.\r\n\r\n"Dearest mother, it did not make me unhappy," he said, caressing her.\r\n\r\n"You bore it like a man, Herbert, as I shall ever remember. But it\r\ndid make me unhappy,--more unhappy than it should have done, when we\r\nremember how very short is our time here below."\r\n\r\nHe remained with his mother for more than an hour, and then returned\r\nto the drawing-room, where the girls were waiting for him with the\r\ntea-things arranged before them.\r\n\r\n"I was very nearly coming up to fetch you," said Mary, "only that we\r\nknew how much mamma must have to say to you."\r\n\r\n"We dined early because we are all so upset," said Emmeline; "and\r\nClara must be dying for her tea."\r\n\r\n"And why should Clara die for tea any more than any one else?" asked\r\nLady Clara herself.\r\n\r\nI will not venture to say what hour it was before they separated for\r\nbed. They sat there with their feet over the fender, talking about\r\nthings gone and things coming,--and there were so many of such things\r\nfor them to discuss! Even yet, as one of the girls remarked, Lady\r\nDesmond had not heard of the last change, or if she had so heard, had\r\nhad no time to communicate with her daughter upon the subject.\r\n\r\nAnd then Owen was spoken of with the warmest praise by them all, and\r\nClara explained openly what had been the full tenor of his intended\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n"That would have been impossible," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"But it was not the less noble in him, was it?" said Clara, eagerly.\r\nBut she did not tell how Owen Fitzgerald had prayed that her love\r\nmight be given back to him, as his reward for what he wished to do on\r\nbehalf of his cousin. Now, at least, at this moment it was not told;\r\nyet the day did come when all that was described,--a day when Owen\r\nin his absence was regarded by them both among the dearest of their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBut even on that night Clara resolved that he should have some meed\r\nof praise. "Has he not been noble?" she said, appealing to him who\r\nwas to be her husband; "has he not been very noble?"\r\n\r\nHerbert, too happy to be jealous, acknowledged that it was so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nPLAYING ROUNDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy story is nearly at its close, and all readers will now know how\r\nit is to end. Those difficulties raised by Mr. Die were all made to\r\nvanish; and though he implored Mr. Prendergast over and over again\r\nto go about this business with a moderated eagerness, that gentleman\r\nwould not consent to let any grass grow under his heels till he had\r\nmade assurance doubly sure, and had seen Herbert Fitzgerald firmly\r\nseated on his throne. All that the women in Spinny Lane had told him\r\nwas quite true. The register was found in the archives of the parish\r\nof Putney, and Mr. Prendergast was able to prove that Mr. Matthew\r\nMollett, now of Spinny Lane, and the Mr. Matthew Mollett then\r\ndesignated as of Newmarket in Cambridgeshire, were one and the same\r\nperson; therefore Mr. Mollett\'s marriage with Miss Wainwright was\r\nno marriage, and therefore, also, the marriage between Sir Thomas\r\nFitzgerald and that lady was a true marriage; all which things will\r\nnow be plain to any novel-reading capacity, mean as such capacity may\r\nbe in respect to legal law.\r\n\r\nAnd I have only further to tell in respect to this part of my story,\r\nthat the Molletts, both father and son, escaped all punishment\r\nfor the frauds and villanies related in these pages--except such\r\npunishment as these frauds and villanies, acting by their own innate\r\ndestructive forces and poisons, brought down upon their unfortunate\r\nheads. For so allowing them to escape I shall be held by many to\r\nhave been deficient in sound teaching. "What!" men will say, "not\r\npunish your evil principle! Allow the prevailing evil genius of your\r\nbook to escape scot free, without administering any of that condign\r\npunishment which it would have been so easy for you to allot to them!\r\nHad you not treadmills to your hand, and all manner of new prison\r\ndisciplines? Should not Matthew have repented in the sackcloth of\r\nsolitary confinement, and Aby have munched and crunched between his\r\nteeth the bitter ashes of prison bread and water? Nay, for such\r\noffences as those did you wot of no penal settlements? Were not\r\nPortland and Spike Islands gaping for them? Had you no memory of\r\nDartmoor and the Bermudas?"\r\n\r\nGentle readers, no; not in this instance shall Spike Island or the\r\nBermudas be asked to give us their assistance. There is a sackcloth\r\nharsher to the skin than that of the penal settlement, and ashes more\r\nbitter in the crunching than convict rations. It would be sad indeed\r\nif we thought that those rascals who escape the law escape also the\r\njust reward of their rascality. May it not rather be believed that\r\nthe whole life of the professional rascal is one long wretched\r\npunishment, to which, if he could but know it, the rations and\r\ncomparative innocence of Bermuda would be so preferable? Is he not\r\nalways rolling the stone of Sysiphus, gyrating on the wheel of Ixion,\r\nhankering after the waters of Tantalus, filling the sieves of the\r\ndaughters of Dana\xfcs? He pours into his sieve stolen corn beyond\r\nmeasure, but no grain will stay there. He lifts to his lips rich\r\ncups, but Rhadamanthus the policeman allows him no moment for a\r\ndraught. The wheel of justice is ever going, while his poor hanging\r\nhead is in a whirl. The stone which he rolls never perches for a\r\nmoment at the top of the hill, for the trade which he follows admits\r\nof no rest. Have I not said truly that he is hunted like a fox,\r\ndriven from covert to covert with his poor empty craving belly?\r\nprowling about through the wet night, he returns with his prey, and\r\nfinds that he is shut out from his lair; his bloodshot eye is ever\r\nover his shoulder, and his advanced foot is ever ready for a start;\r\nhe stinks in the nostrils of the hounds of the law, and is held by\r\nall men to be vermin.\r\n\r\nOne would say that the rascal, if he but knew the truth, would\r\nlook forward to Spike Island and the Bermudas with impatience and\r\nraptures. The cold, hungry, friendless, solitary doom of unconvicted\r\nrascaldom has ever seemed to me to be the most wretched phase of\r\nhuman existence,--that phase of living in which the liver can trust\r\nno one, and be trusted by none; in which the heart is ever quailing\r\nat the policeman\'s hat, and the eye ever shrinking from the\r\npoliceman\'s gaze. The convict does trust his gaoler, at any rate his\r\nmaster gaoler, and in so doing is not all wretched. It is Bill Sikes\r\nbefore conviction that I have ever pitied. Any man can endure to be\r\nhanged; but how can any man have taken that Bill Sikes\' walk and have\r\nlived through it?\r\n\r\nTo such punishments will we leave the Molletts, hoping of the elder\r\none, that under the care of those ministering angels in Spinny Lane,\r\nhis heart may yet be softened; hoping also for the younger one that\r\nsome ministering angel may be appointed also for his aid. \'Tis a\r\ngrievous piece of work though, that of a ministering angel to such a\r\nsoul as his. And now, having seen them so far on their mortal career,\r\nwe will take our leave of both of them.\r\n\r\nMr. Prendergast\'s object in sparing them was of course that of saving\r\nLady Fitzgerald from the terrible pain of having her name brought\r\nforward at any trial. She never spoke of this, even to Herbert,\r\nallowing those in whom she trusted to manage those things for her\r\nwithout an expression of anxiety on her own part; but she was not the\r\nless thankful when she found that no public notice was to be taken of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after Herbert\'s return to Castle Richmond, it was\r\nnotified to him that he need have no fear as to his inheritance; and\r\nit was so notified with the great additional comfort of an assuring\r\nopinion from Mr. Die. He then openly called himself Sir Herbert, took\r\nupon himself the property which became his by right of the entail,\r\nand issued orders for the preparation of his marriage settlement.\r\nDuring this period he saw Owen Fitzgerald; but he did so in the\r\npresence of Mr. Somers, and not a word was then said about Lady\r\nClara Desmond. Both the gentlemen, Herbert and Mr. Somers, cordially\r\nthanked the master of Hap House for the way in which he had behaved\r\nto the Castle Richmond family, and in reference to the Castle\r\nRichmond property during the terrible events of the last two months;\r\nbut Owen took their thanks somewhat haughtily. He shook hands warmly\r\nenough with his cousin, wishing him joy on the arrangement of his\r\naffairs, and was at first less distant than usual with Mr. Somers;\r\nbut when they alluded to his own conduct, and expressed their\r\ngratitude, he declared that he had done nothing for which thanks were\r\ndue, and that he begged it to be understood that he laid claim to no\r\ngratitude. Had he acted otherwise, he said, he would have deserved to\r\nbe kicked out of the presence of all honest men; and to be thanked\r\nfor the ordinary conduct of a gentleman was almost an insult. This he\r\nsaid looking chiefly at Mr. Somers, and then turning to his cousin,\r\nhe asked him if he intended to remain in the country.\r\n\r\n"Oh, certainly," said Herbert.\r\n\r\n"I shall not," said Owen; "and if you know any one who will take a\r\nlease of Hap House for ten or twelve years, I shall be glad to find a\r\ntenant."\r\n\r\n"And you, where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"To Africa in the first instance," said he; "there seems to be some\r\ngood hunting there, and I think that I shall try it."\r\n\r\nThe new tidings were not long in reaching Desmond Court, and the\r\ncountess was all alone when she first heard them. With very great\r\ndifficulty, taking as it were the bit between her teeth, Clara had\r\nmanaged to get over to Castle Richmond that she might pay a last\r\nvisit to the Fitzgerald girls. At this time Lady Desmond\'s mind was\r\nin a terribly distracted state. The rumour was rife about the country\r\nthat Owen had refused to accept the property; and the countess\r\nherself had of course been made aware that he had so refused. But she\r\nwas too keenly awake to the affairs of the world to suppose that such\r\na refusal could continue long in force; neither, as she knew well,\r\ncould Herbert accept of that which was offered to him. It might be\r\nthat for some years to come the property might be unenjoyed; the rich\r\nfruit might fall rotten from the wall; but what would that avail to\r\nher or to her child? Herbert would still be a nameless man, and could\r\nnever be master of Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Clara carried her point, and went over to her friends,\r\nleaving the countess all alone. She had now permitted her son to\r\nreturn to Eton, finding that he was powerless to aid her. The young\r\nearl was quite willing that his sister should marry Owen Fitzgerald;\r\nbut he was not willing to use any power of persuasion that he might\r\nhave, in what his mother considered a useful or legitimate manner.\r\nHe talked of rewarding Owen for his generosity; but Clara would have\r\nnothing to do either with the generosity or with the reward. And so\r\nLady Desmond was left alone, hearing that even Owen, Owen himself,\r\nhad now given up the quest, and feeling that it was useless to have\r\nany further hope. "She will make her own bed," the countess said to\r\nherself, "and she must lie on it."\r\n\r\nAnd then came this rumour that after all Herbert was to be the man.\r\nIt first reached her ears about the same time that Herbert arrived at\r\nhis own house, but it did so in such a manner as to make but little\r\nimpression at the moment. Lady Desmond had but few gossips, and in\r\na general way heard but little of what was doing in the country.\r\nOn this occasion the Caleb Balderston of her house came in, making\r\nstately bows to his mistress, and with low voice, and eyes wide\r\nopen, told her what a gossoon running over from Castle Richmond had\r\nreported in the kitchen of Desmond Court. "At any rate, my lady,\r\nMr. Herbert is expected this evening at the house;" and then Caleb\r\nBalderston, bowing stately again, left the room. This did not make\r\nmuch impression, but it made some.\r\n\r\nAnd then on the following day Clara wrote to her: this she did after\r\ndeep consideration and much consultation with her friends. It would\r\nbe unkind, they argued, to leave Lady Desmond in ignorance on such\r\na subject; and therefore a note was written very guardedly, the\r\njoint production of the three, in which, with the expression of many\r\ndoubts, it was told that perhaps after all Herbert might yet be the\r\nman. But even then the countess did not believe it.\r\n\r\nBut during the next week the rumour became a fact through the\r\ncountry, and everybody knew, even the Countess of Desmond, that all\r\nthat family history was again changed. Lady Fitzgerald, whom they had\r\nall known, was Lady Fitzgerald still, and Herbert was once more on\r\nhis throne. When rumours thus became a fact, there was no longer any\r\ndoubt about the matter. The countryside did not say that, "perhaps\r\nafter all so and so would go in such and such a way," or that "legal\r\ndoubts having been entertained, the gentlemen of the long robe were\r\nabout to do this and that." By the end of the first week the affair\r\nwas as surely settled in county Cork as though the line of the\r\nFitzgeralds had never been disturbed; and Sir Herbert was fully\r\nseated on his throne.\r\n\r\nIt was well then for poor Owen that he had never assumed the regalia\r\nof royalty: had he done so his fall would have been very dreadful; as\r\nit was, not only were all those pangs spared to him, but he achieved\r\nat once an immense popularity through the whole country. Everybody\r\ncalled him poor Owen, and declared how well he had behaved. Some\r\nexpressed almost a regret that his generosity should go unrewarded,\r\nand others went so far as to give him his reward: he was to\r\nmarry Emmeline Fitzgerald, they said at the clubs in Cork, and a\r\nconsiderable slice of the property was destined to give additional\r\ncharms to the young lady\'s hand and heart. For a month or so Owen\r\nFitzgerald was the most popular man in the south of Ireland; that is,\r\nas far as a man can be popular who never shows himself.\r\n\r\nAnd the countess had to answer her daughter\'s letter. "If this be\r\nso," she said, "of course I shall be well pleased. My anxiety has\r\nbeen only for your welfare, to further which I have been willing to\r\nmake any possible sacrifice." Clara when she read this did not know\r\nwhat sacrifice had been made, nor had the countess thought as she\r\nwrote the words what had been the sacrifice to which she had thus\r\nalluded, though her heart was ever conscious of it, unconsciously.\r\nAnd the countess sent her love to them all at Castle Richmond. "She\r\ndid not fear," she said, "that they would misinterpret her. Lady\r\nFitzgerald, she was sure, would perfectly understand that she had\r\nendeavoured to do her duty by her child." It was by no means a\r\nbad letter, and, which was better, was in the main a true letter.\r\nAccording to her light she had striven to do her duty, and her\r\nconduct was not misjudged, at any rate at Castle Richmond.\r\n\r\n"You must not think harshly of mamma," said Clara to her future\r\nmother-in-law.\r\n\r\n"Oh no," said Lady Fitzgerald. "I certainly do not think harshly of\r\nher. In her position I should probably have acted as she has done."\r\nThe difference, however, between them was this, that it was all\r\nbut impossible that Lady Fitzgerald should not sympathize with her\r\nchildren, while it was almost impossible that the Countess of Desmond\r\nshould do so.\r\n\r\nAnd so Lady Desmond remained all alone at Desmond Court, brooding\r\nover the things as they now were. For the present it was better that\r\nClara should remain at Castle Richmond, and nothing therefore was\r\nsaid of her return on either side. She could not add to her mother\'s\r\ncomfort at home, and why should she not remain happy where she was?\r\nShe was already a Fitzgerald in heart rather than a Desmond; and\r\nwas it not well that she should be so? If she could love Herbert\r\nFitzgerald, that was well also. Since the day on which he had\r\nappeared at Desmond Court, wet and dirty and wretched, with a broken\r\nspirit and fortunes as draggled as his dress, he had lost all claim\r\nto be a hero in the estimation of Lady Desmond. To her those only\r\nwere heroes whose pride and spirit were never draggled; and such a\r\nhero there still was in her close neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nLady Desmond herself was a woman of a mercenary spirit; so at least\r\nit will be said and thought of her. But she was not altogether so,\r\nalthough the two facts were strong against her that she had sold\r\nherself for a title, and had been willing to sell her daughter for\r\na fortune. Poverty she herself had endured upon the whole with\r\npatience; and though she hated and scorned it from her very soul, she\r\nwould now have given herself in marriage to a poor man without rank\r\nor station,--she, a countess, and the mother of an earl; and that\r\nshe would have done with all the romantic love of a girl of sixteen,\r\nthough she was now a woman verging upon forty!\r\n\r\nMen and women only know so much of themselves and others as\r\ncircumstances and their destiny have allowed to appear. Had it\r\nperchance fallen to thy lot, O my forensic friend, heavy laden\r\nwith the wisdom of the law, to write tales such as this of mine,\r\nhow charmingly might not thy characters have come forth upon the\r\ncanvas--how much more charmingly than I can limn them! While, on the\r\nother hand, ignorant as thou now tellest me that I am of the very\r\nalphabet of the courts, had thy wig been allotted to me, I might have\r\ngathered guineas thick as daisies in summer, while to thee perhaps\r\nthey come no faster than snow-drops in the early spring. It is all\r\nin our destiny. Chance had thrown that terrible earl in the way of\r\nthe poor girl in her early youth, and she had married him. She had\r\nmarried him, and all idea of love had flown from her heart. All idea\r\nof love, but not all the capacity--as now within this last year or\r\ntwo she had learned, so much to her cost.\r\n\r\nLong months had passed since she had first owned this to herself,\r\nsince she had dared to tell herself that it was possible even for her\r\nto begin the world again, and to play the game which women love to\r\nplay, once at least before they die. She could have worshipped this\r\nman, and sat at his feet, and endowed him in her heart with heroism,\r\nand given him her soft brown hair to play with when it suited her\r\nHercules to rest from his labours. She could have forgotten her\r\nyears, and have forgotten too the children who had now grown up to\r\nseize the world from beneath her feet--to seize it before she herself\r\nhad enjoyed it. She could have forgotten all that was past, and have\r\nbeen every whit as young as her own daughter. If only--!\r\n\r\nIt is so, I believe, with most of us who have begun to turn the hill.\r\nI myself could go on to that common that is at this moment before me,\r\nand join that game of rounders with the most intense delight. "By\r\nGeorge! you fellow, you\'ve no eyes; didn\'t you see that he hadn\'t\r\nput his foot in the hole. He\'ll get back now that long-backed,\r\nhard-hitting chap, and your side is done for the next half-hour!" But\r\nthen they would all be awestruck for a while; and after that, when\r\nthey grew to be familiar with me, they would laugh at me because\r\nI loomed large in my running, and returned to my ground scant of\r\nbreath. Alas, alas! I know that it would not do. So I pass by,\r\nimperious in my heavy manhood, and one of the lads respectfully\r\nabstains from me though the ball is under my very feet.\r\n\r\nBut then I have had my game of rounders. No horrible old earl with\r\ngloating eyes carried me off in my childhood and robbed me of the\r\npleasure of my youth. That part of my cake has been eaten, and, in\r\nspite of some occasional headache, has been digested not altogether\r\nunsatisfactorily. Lady Desmond had as yet been allowed no slice of\r\nher cake. She had never yet taken her side in any game of rounders.\r\nBut she too had looked on and seen how jocund was the play; she also\r\nhad acknowledged that that running in the ring, that stout hitting of\r\nthe ball, that innocent craft, that bringing back by her own skill\r\nand with her own hand of some long-backed fellow, would be pleasant\r\nto her as well as to others. If only she now could be chosen in at\r\nthat game! But what if the side that she cared for would not have\r\nher?\r\n\r\nBut _tempus edax rerum_, though it had hardly nibbled at her heart or\r\nwishes, had been feeding on the freshness of her brow and the bloom\r\nof her lips. The child with whom she would have loved to play kept\r\naloof from her too, and would not pick up the ball when it rolled\r\nto his feet. All this, if one thinks of it, is hard to bear. It is\r\nvery hard to have had no period for rounders, not to be able even to\r\nlook back to one\'s games, and to talk of them to one\'s old comrades!\r\n"But why then did she allow herself to be carried off by the wicked\r\nwrinkled earl with the gloating eyes?" asks of me the prettiest girl\r\nin the world, just turned eighteen. Oh heavens! Is it not possible\r\nthat one should have one more game of rounders? Quite impossible, O\r\nmy fat friend! And therefore I answer the young lady somewhat grimly.\r\n"Take care that thou also art not carried off by a wrinkled earl. Is\r\nthy heart free from all vanity? Of what nature is the heroism that\r\nthou worshippest?" "A nice young man!" she says, boldly, though in\r\nwords somewhat different. "If so it will be well for thee; but did I\r\nnot see thine eyes hankering the other day after the precious stones\r\nof Ophir, and thy mouth watering for the flesh-pots of Egypt? Was\r\nI not watching thee as thou sattest at that counter, so frightfully\r\nintent? Beware!" "The grumpy old fellow with the bald head!" she said\r\nshortly afterwards to her bosom friend, not careful that her words\r\nshould be duly inaudible.\r\n\r\nSome idea that all was not yet over with her had come upon her poor\r\nheart,--upon Lady Desmond\'s heart, soon after Owen Fitzgerald had\r\nmade himself familiar in her old mansion. We have read how that idea\r\nwas banished, and how she had ultimately resolved that that man whom\r\nshe could have loved herself should be given up to her own child when\r\nshe thought that he was no longer poor and of low rank. She could not\r\nsympathize with her daughter,--love with her love, and rejoice with\r\nher joy; but she could do her duty by her, and according to her\r\nlights she endeavoured so to do.\r\n\r\nBut now again all was turned and changed and altered. Owen of Hap\r\nHouse was once more Owen of Hap House only, but still in her eyes\r\nheroic, as it behoved a man to be. He would not creep about the\r\ncountry with moaning voice and melancholy eyes, with draggled dress\r\nand outward signs of wretchedness. He might be wretched, but he would\r\nstill be manly. Could it be possible that to her should yet be given\r\nthe privilege of soothing that noble, unbending wretchedness? By no\r\nmeans possible, poor, heart-laden countess; thy years are all against\r\nthee. Girls whose mouths will water unduly for the flesh-pots of\r\nEgypt must in after life undergo such penalties as these. Art thou\r\nnot a countess?\r\n\r\nBut not so did she answer herself. Might it not be possible? Ah,\r\nmight it not be possible? And as the question was even then being\r\nasked, perhaps for the ten thousandth time, Owen Fitzgerald stood\r\nbefore her. She had not yet seen him since the new news had gone\r\nabroad, and had hardly yet conceived how it might be possible that\r\nshe should do so. But now as she thought of him there he was. They\r\ntwo were together,--alone together; and the door by which he had\r\nentered had closed upon him before she was aware of his presence.\r\n\r\n"Owen Fitzgerald!" she said, starting up and giving him both her\r\nhands. This she did, not of judgment, nor yet from passion, but of\r\nimpulse. She had been thinking of him with such kindly thoughts,\r\nand now he was there it became natural that her greeting should be\r\nkindly. It was more so than it had ever been to any but her son since\r\nthe wrinkled, gloating earl had come and fetched her.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Owen Fitzgerald," said he, taking the two hands that were\r\noffered to him, and holding them awhile; not pressing them as a man\r\nwho loved her, who could have loved her, would have done. "After all\r\nthat has gone and passed between us, Lady Desmond, I cannot leave the\r\ncountry without saying one word of farewell to you."\r\n\r\n"Leave the country!" she exclaimed. "And where are you going?"\r\n\r\nAs she looked into his face with her hands still in his,--for she did\r\nnot on the moment withdraw them, she felt that he had never before\r\nlooked so noble, so handsome, so grand. Leave the country! ah, yes;\r\nand why should not she leave it also? What was there to bind her to\r\nthose odious walls in which she had been immolated during the best\r\nhalf of her life?\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?" she asked, looking almost wildly up at him.\r\n\r\n"Somewhere very far a-field, Lady Desmond," he said; and then the\r\nhands dropped from him. "You will understand at any rate that Hap\r\nHouse will not be a fitting residence for me."\r\n\r\n"I hate the whole country," said she, "the whole place hereabouts.\r\nI have never been happy here. Happy! I have never been other than\r\nunhappy. I have been wretched. What would I not give to leave it\r\nalso?"\r\n\r\n"To you it cannot be intolerable as it will be to me. You have known\r\nso thoroughly where all my hopes were garnered, that I need not tell\r\nyou why I must go from Hap House. I think that I have been wronged,\r\nbut I do not desire that others should think so. And as for you and\r\nme, Lady Desmond, though we have been enemies, we have been friends\r\nalso."\r\n\r\n"Enemies!" said she, "I hope not." And she spoke so softly, so\r\nunlike her usual self, in the tones so suited to a loving, clinging\r\nwoman, that though he did not understand it, he was startled at\r\nher tenderness. "I have never felt that you were my enemy, Mr.\r\nFitzgerald; and certainly I never was an enemy to you."\r\n\r\n"Well; we were opposed to each other. I thought that you were robbing\r\nme of all I valued in life; and you, you thought--"\r\n\r\n"I thought that Clara\'s happiness demanded rank and wealth and\r\nposition. There; I tell you my sins fairly. You may say that I was\r\nmercenary if you will,--mercenary for her. I thought that I knew what\r\nwould be needful for her. Can you be angry with a mother for that?"\r\n\r\n"She had given me a promise! But never mind. It is all over now. I\r\ndid not come to upbraid you, but to tell you that I now know how it\r\nmust be, and that I am going."\r\n\r\n"Had you won her, Owen," said the countess, looking intently into his\r\nface, "had you won her, she would not have made you happy."\r\n\r\n"As to that it was for me to judge--for me and her. I thought\r\nit would, and was willing to peril all in the trial. And so was\r\nshe--willing at one time. But never mind; it is useless to talk of\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Quite useless now."\r\n\r\n"I did think--when it was as they said in my power to give him back\r\nhis own,--I did think;--but no, it would have been mean to look for\r\npayment. It is all over, and I will say nothing further; not a word.\r\nI am not a girl to harp on such a thing day after day, and to grow\r\nsick with love. I shall be better away. And therefore I am going, and\r\nI have now come to say good-bye, because we were friends in old days,\r\nLady Desmond."\r\n\r\nFriends in old days! They were old days to him, but they were no more\r\nthan the other day to her. It was as yet hardly more than two years\r\nsince she had first known him, and yet he looked on the acquaintance\r\nas one that had run out its time and required to be ended. She would\r\nso fain have been able to think that the beginning only had as yet\r\ncome to them. But there he was, anxious to bid her adieu, and what\r\nwas she to say to him?\r\n\r\n"Yes, we were friends. You have been my only friend here I think. You\r\nwill hardly believe with how much true friendship I have thought of\r\nyou when the feud between us--if it was a feud--was at the strongest.\r\nOwen Fitzgerald, I have loved you through it all."\r\n\r\nLoved him? She was so handsome as she spoke, so womanly, so graceful,\r\nthere was still about her so much of the charm of beauty, that he\r\ncould hardly take the word when coming from her mouth as applicable\r\nto ordinary friendship. And yet he did so take it. They had all loved\r\neach other--as friends should love--and now that he was going she\r\nhad chosen to say as much. He felt the blood tingle his cheek at the\r\nsound of her words; but he was not vain enough to take it in its\r\nusual sense. "Then we will part as friends," said he--tamely enough.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we will part," she said. And as she spoke the blood mantled\r\ndeep on her neck and cheek and forehead, and a spirit came out of\r\nher eye, such as never had shone there before in his presence. "Yes,\r\nwe will part," and she took up his right hand, and held it closely,\r\npressed between both her own. "And as we must part I will tell you\r\nall. Owen Fitzgerald, I have loved you with all my heart,--with all\r\nthe love that a woman has to give. I have loved you, and have never\r\nloved any other. Stop, stop," for he was going to interrupt her. "You\r\nshall hear me now to the last,--and for the last time. I have loved\r\nyou with such love--such love as you perhaps felt for her, but as she\r\nwill never feel. But you shall not say, nay you shall not think that\r\nI have been selfish. I would have kept you from her when you were\r\npoor as you are now,--not because I loved you. No; you will never\r\nthink that of me. And when I thought that you were rich, and the head\r\nof your family, I did all that I could to bring her back for you. Did\r\nI not, Owen?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think you did," he muttered between his teeth, hardly knowing\r\nhow to speak.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, indeed I did so. Others may say that I was selfish for my\r\nchild, but you shall not think that I was selfish for myself. I sent\r\nfor Patrick, and bade him go to you. I strove as mothers do strive\r\nfor their children. I taught myself,--I strove to teach myself to\r\nforget that I had loved you. I swore on my knees that I would love\r\nyou only as my son,--as my dear, dear son. Nay, Owen, I did; on my\r\nknees before my God."\r\n\r\nHe turned away from her to rub the tears from his eyes, and in doing\r\nso he dragged his hand away from her. But she followed him, and again\r\ntook it. "You will hear me to the end now," she said; "will you not?\r\nyou will not begrudge me that? And then came these other tidings, and\r\nall that scheme was dashed to the ground. It was better so, Owen; you\r\nwould not have been happy with the property--"\r\n\r\n"I should never have taken it."\r\n\r\n"And she, she would have clung closer to him as a poor man than ever\r\nshe had done when he was rich. She is her mother\'s daughter there.\r\nAnd then--then-- But I need not tell you more. You will know it all\r\nnow. If you had become rich, I would have ceased to love you; but I\r\nshall never cease now that you are again poor,--now that you are Owen\r\nof Hap House again, as you sent us word yourself that day."\r\n\r\nAnd then she ceased, and bending down her head bathed his hand with\r\nher tears. Had any one asked him that morning, he would have said\r\nthat it was impossible that the Countess of Desmond should weep.\r\nAnd now the tears were streaming from her eyes as though she were a\r\nbroken-hearted girl. And so she was. Her girlhood had been postponed\r\nand marred,--not destroyed and made away with, by the wrinkled earl\r\nwith the gloating eyes.\r\n\r\nShe had said all now, and she stood there, still holding his hand in\r\nhers, but with her head turned from him. It was his turn to speak\r\nnow, and how was he to answer her. I know how most men would have\r\nanswered;--by the pressure of an arm, by a warm kiss, by a promise\r\nof love, and by a feeling that such love was possible. And then most\r\nmen would have gone home, leaving the woman triumphant, and have\r\nrepented bitterly as they sat moody over their own fires, with their\r\nwine-bottles before them. But it was not so with Owen Fitzgerald.\r\nHis heart was to him a reality. He had loved with all his power and\r\nstrength, with all the vigour of his soul,--having chosen to love.\r\nBut he would not now be enticed by pity into a bastard feeling,\r\nwhich would die away when the tenderness of the moment was no longer\r\npresent to his eye and touch. His love for Clara had been such that\r\nhe could not even say that he loved another.\r\n\r\n"Dear Lady Desmond," he began.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Owen; we are to part now, part for ever," she said; "speak to me\r\nonce in your life as though we were equal friends. Cannot you forget\r\nfor one minute that I am Countess of Desmond?"\r\n\r\nMary, Countess of Desmond; such was her name and title. But so little\r\nfamiliar had he been with the name by which he had never heard her\r\ncalled, that in his confusion he could not remember it. And had he\r\ndone so, he could not have brought himself to use it. "Yes," he said;\r\n"we must part. It is impossible for me to remain here."\r\n\r\n"Doubly impossible now," she replied, half reproaching him.\r\n\r\n"Yes; doubly impossible now. Is it not better that the truth should\r\nbe spoken?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I have spoken it--too plainly."\r\n\r\n"And so will I speak it plainly. We cannot control our own hearts,\r\nLady Desmond. It is, as you say, doubly impossible now. All the love\r\nI have had to give she has had,--and has. Such being so, why should I\r\nstay here? or could you wish that I should do so?"\r\n\r\n"I do not wish it." That was true enough. The wish would have been to\r\nwander away with him.\r\n\r\n"I must go, and shall start at once. My very things are packed for my\r\ngoing. I will not be here to have the sound of their marriage bells\r\njangling in my ears. I will not be pointed at as the man who has been\r\nduped on every side."\r\n\r\n"Ah me, that I was a man too,--that I could go away and make for\r\nmyself a life!"\r\n\r\n"You have Desmond with you."\r\n\r\n"No, no. He will go too; of course he will go. He will go, and I\r\nshall be utterly alone. What a fool I am,--what an ass, that by this\r\ntime I have not learned to bear it!"\r\n\r\n"They will always be near you at Castle Richmond."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Owen, how little you understand! Have we been friends while we\r\nlived under the same roof? And now that she is there, do you think\r\nthat she will heed me? I tell you that you do not know her. She is\r\nexcellent, good, devoted; but cold as ice. She will live among the\r\npoor, and grace his table; and he will have all that he wants. In\r\ntwelve months, Owen, she would have turned your heart to a stone."\r\n\r\n"It is that already I think," said he. "At any rate, it will be so to\r\nall others. Good-bye, Lady Desmond."\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Owen; and God bless you. My secret will be safe with you."\r\n\r\n"Safe! yes, it will be safe." And then, as she put her cheek up to\r\nhim, he kissed it and left her.\r\n\r\nHe had been very stern. She had laid bare to him her whole heart,\r\nand he had answered her love by never a word. He had made no reply\r\nin any shape,--given her no thanks for her heart\'s treasure. He had\r\nresponded to her affection by no tenderness. He had not even said\r\nthat this might have been so, had that other not have come to pass.\r\nBy no word had he alluded to her confession,--but had regarded her\r\ndelusion as monstrous, a thing of which no word was to be spoken.\r\n\r\nSo at least said the countess to herself, sitting there all alone\r\nwhere he had left her. "He regards me as old and worn. In his eyes\r\nI am wrinkled and ugly." \'Twas thus that her thoughts expressed\r\nthemselves; and then she walked across the room towards the mirror,\r\nbut when there she could not look in it: she turned her back upon\r\nit without a glance, and returned to her seat by the window. What\r\nmattered it now? It was her doom to live there alone for the term of\r\nlife with which it might still please God to afflict her.\r\n\r\nAnd then looking out from the window her eyes fell upon Owen as he\r\nrode slowly down across the park. His horse was walking very slowly,\r\nand it seemed as though he himself were unconscious of the pace.\r\nAs long as he remained in sight she did not take her eyes from his\r\nfigure, gazing at him painfully as he grew dimmer and more dim in the\r\ndistance. Then at last he turned behind the bushes near the lodge,\r\nand she felt that she was all alone. It was the last that she ever\r\nsaw of Owen Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate girl, marred in thy childhood by that wrinkled earl\r\nwith the gloating eyes; or marred rather by thine own vanity! Those\r\nflesh-pots of Egypt! Are they not always thus bitter in the eating?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now my story is told; and were it not for the fashion of the\r\nthing, this last short chapter might be spared. It shall at any rate\r\nbe very short.\r\n\r\nWere it not that I eschew the fashion of double names for a book,\r\nthinking that no amount of ingenuity in this respect will make a bad\r\nbook pass muster, whereas a good book will turn out as such though no\r\nsuch ingenuity be displayed, I might have called this "A Tale of the\r\nFamine Year in Ireland." At the period of the year to which the story\r\nhas brought us--and at which it will leave us--the famine was at its\r\nvery worst. People were beginning to believe that there would never\r\nbe a bit more to eat in the land, and that the time for hope and\r\nenergy was gone. Land was becoming of no value, and the only thing\r\nregarded was a sufficiency of food to keep body and soul together.\r\nUnder such circumstances it was difficult to hope.\r\n\r\nBut energy without hope is impossible, and therefore was there such\r\nan apathy and deadness through the country. It was not that they did\r\nnot work who were most concerned to work. The amount of conscientious\r\nwork then done was most praiseworthy. But it was done almost without\r\nhope of success, and done chiefly as a matter of conscience. There\r\nwas a feeling, which was not often expressed but which seemed to\r\nprevail everywhere, that ginger would not again be hot in the mouth,\r\nand that in very truth the time for cakes and ale in this world was\r\nall over. It was this feeling that made a residence in Ireland at\r\nthat period so very sad.\r\n\r\nAh me! how little do we know what is coming to us! Irish cakes and\r\nale were done and over for this world, we all thought. But in truth\r\nthe Irish cakes were only then a-baking, and the Irish ale was being\r\nbrewed. I am not sure that these good things are yet quite fit for\r\nthe palates of the guest;--not as fit as a little more time will make\r\nthem. The cake is still too new,--cakes often are; and the ale is\r\nnot sufficiently mellowed. But of this I am sure, that the cakes and\r\nale are there;--and the ginger, too, very hot in the mouth. Let a\r\ncommittee of Irish landlords say how the rents are paid now, and what\r\namount of arrears was due through the country when the famine came\r\namong them. Rents paid to the day: that is the ginger hot in the\r\nmouth which best pleases the palate of a country gentleman.\r\n\r\nBut if one did in truth write a tale of the famine, after that it\r\nwould behove the author to write a tale of the pestilence; and\r\nthen another, a tale of the exodus. These three wonderful events,\r\nfollowing each other, were the blessings coming from Omniscience and\r\nOmnipotence by which the black clouds were driven from the Irish\r\nfirmament. If one, through it all, could have dared to hope, and have\r\nhad from the first that wisdom which has learned to acknowledge that\r\nHis mercy endureth for ever! And then the same author going on with\r\nhis series would give in his last set,--Ireland in her prosperity.\r\n\r\nOf all those who did true good conscientious work at this time, none\r\nexceeded in energy our friend Herbert Fitzgerald after his return to\r\nCastle Richmond. It seemed to him as though some thank-offering were\r\ndue from him for all the good things that Providence had showered\r\nupon him, and the best thank-offering that he could give was a\r\ndevoted attention to the interest of the poor around him. Mr. Somers\r\nsoon resigned to him the chair at those committee meetings at\r\nBerryhill and Gortnaclough, and it was acknowledged that the Castle\r\nRichmond arrangements for soup-kitchens, out-door relief, and\r\nlabour-gangs, might be taken as a model for the south of Ireland. Few\r\nother men were able to go to the work with means so ample and with\r\nhands so perfectly free. Mr. Carter even, who by this time had become\r\ncemented in a warm trilateral friendship with Father Barney and the\r\nRev. \xc6neas Townsend, was obliged to own that many a young English\r\ncountry gentleman might take a lesson from Sir Herbert Fitzgerald in\r\nthe duties peculiar to his position.\r\n\r\nHis marriage did not take place till full six months after the period\r\nto which our story has brought us. Baronets with twelve thousand a\r\nyear cannot be married off the hooks, as may be done with ordinary\r\nmortals. Settlements of a grandiose nature were required, and were\r\nduly concocted. Perhaps Mr. Die had something to say to them, so\r\nthat the great maxim of the law was brought into play. Perhaps also,\r\nthough of this Herbert heard no word, it was thought inexpedient to\r\nhurry matters while any further inquiry was possible in that affair\r\nof the Mollett connection. Mr. Die and Mr. Prendergast were certainly\r\ngoing about, still drawing all coverts far and near, lest their\r\nfox might not have been fairly run to his last earth. But, as I\r\nhave said, no tidings as to this reached Castle Richmond. There, in\r\nIreland, no man troubled himself further with any doubt upon the\r\nsubject; and Sir Herbert took his title and received his rents, by\r\nthe hands of Mr. Somers, exactly as though the Molletts, father and\r\nson, had never appeared in those parts.\r\n\r\nIt was six months before the marriage was celebrated, but during a\r\nconsiderable part of that time Clara remained a visitor at Castle\r\nRichmond. To Lady Fitzgerald she was now the same as a daughter, and\r\nto Aunt Letty the same as a niece. By the girls she had for months\r\nbeen regarded as a sister. So she remained in the house of which she\r\nwas to be the mistress, learning to know their ways, and ingratiating\r\nherself with those who were to be dependent on her.\r\n\r\n"But I had rather stay with you, mamma, if you will allow me," Clara\r\nhad said to her mother when the countess was making some arrangement\r\nwith her that she should return to Castle Richmond. "I shall be\r\nleaving you altogether so soon now!" And she got up close to her\r\nmother\'s side caressingly, and would fain have pressed into her arms\r\nand kissed her, and have talked to her of what was coming, as a\r\ndaughter loves to talk to a loving mother. But Lady Desmond\'s heart\r\nwas sore and sad and harsh, and she preferred to be alone.\r\n\r\n"You will be better at Castle Richmond, my dear: you will be much\r\nhappier there, of course. There can be no reason why you should come\r\nagain into the gloom of this prison."\r\n\r\n"But I should be with you, dearest mamma."\r\n\r\n"It is better that you should be with the Fitzgeralds now; and as\r\nfor me--I must learn to live alone. Indeed I have learned it, so you\r\nneed not mind for me." Clara was rebuffed by the tone rather than the\r\nwords, but she still looked up into her mother\'s face wistfully. "Go,\r\nmy dear," said the countess--"I would sooner be alone at present."\r\nAnd so Clara went. It was hard upon her that even now her mother\r\nwould not accept her love.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Desmond could not be cordial with her daughter. She made\r\nmore than one struggle to do so, but always failed. She could,--she\r\nthought that she could, have watched her child\'s happiness with\r\ncontentment had Clara married Owen Fitzgerald--Sir Owen, as he would\r\nthen have been. But now she could only remember that Owen was lost to\r\nthem both, lost through her child\'s fault. She did not hate Clara:\r\nnay, she would have made any sacrifice for her daughter\'s welfare;\r\nbut she could not take her lovingly to her bosom. So she shut herself\r\nup alone, in her prison as she called it, and then looked back upon\r\nthe errors of her life. It was as well for her to look back as to\r\nlook forward, for what joy was there for which she could dare to\r\nhope?\r\n\r\nIn the days that were coming, however, she did relax something of\r\nher sternness. Clara was of course married from Desmond Court, and\r\nthe very necessity of making some preparations for this festivity\r\nwas in itself salutary. But indeed it could hardly be called\r\na festivity,--it was so quiet and sombre. Clara had but two\r\nbridesmaids, and they were Mary and Emmeline Fitzgerald. The\r\nyoung earl gave away his sister, and Aunt Letty was there, and Mr.\r\nPrendergast, who had come over about the settlements; Mr. Somers\r\nalso attended, and the ceremony was performed by our old friend Mr.\r\nTownsend. Beyond these there were no guests at the wedding of Sir\r\nHerbert Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nThe young earl was there, and at the last the wedding had been\r\npostponed a week for his coming. He had left Eton at Midsummer in\r\norder that he might travel for a couple of years with Owen Fitzgerald\r\nbefore he went to Oxford. It had been the lad\'s own request, and had\r\nbeen for a while refused by Owen. But Fitzgerald had at last given\r\nway to the earl\'s love, and they had started together for Norway.\r\n\r\n"They want me to be home," he had said one morning to his friend.\r\n\r\n"Ah, yes; I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"Do you know why?" They had never spoken a word about Clara since\r\nthey had left England together, and the earl now dreaded to mention\r\nher name.\r\n\r\n"Know why!" replied Owen; "of course I do. It is to give away your\r\nsister. Go home, Desmond, my boy; when you have returned we will talk\r\nabout her. I shall bear it better when I know that she is his wife."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was with them. For two years Lord Desmond travelled with\r\nhim, and after that Owen Fitzgerald went on upon his wanderings\r\nalone. Many a long year has run by since that, and yet he has never\r\ncome back to Hap House. Men of the county Cork now talk of him as one\r\nwhom they knew long since. He who took his house as a stranger is\r\na stranger no longer in the country, and the place that Owen left\r\nvacant has been filled. The hounds of Duhallow would not recognize\r\nhis voice, nor would the steed in the stable follow gently at his\r\nheels. But there is yet one left who thinks of him, hoping that she\r\nmay yet see him before she dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CASTLE RICHMOND***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 5897-8.txt or 5897-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/5/8/9/5897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
