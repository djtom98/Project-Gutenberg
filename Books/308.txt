We were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about\r\nhow bad we were\xe2\x80\x94bad from a medical point of view I mean, of course.\r\n\r\nWe were all feeling seedy, and we were getting quite nervous about it.\r\nHarris said he felt such extraordinary fits of giddiness come over him\r\nat times, that he hardly knew what he was doing; and then George said\r\nthat _he_ had fits of giddiness too, and hardly knew what _he_ was\r\ndoing. With me, it was my liver that was out of order. I knew it was my\r\nliver that was out of order, because I had just been reading a patent\r\nliver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by\r\nwhich a man could tell when his liver was out of order. I had them all.\r\n\r\nIt is a most extraordinary thing, but I never read a patent medicine\r\nadvertisement without being impelled to the conclusion that I am\r\nsuffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most\r\nvirulent form. The diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly\r\nwith all the sensations that I have ever felt.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Man reading book] I remember going to the British Museum one\r\nday to read up the treatment for some slight ailment of which I had\r\na touch\xe2\x80\x94hay fever, I fancy it was. I got down the book, and read all\r\nI came to read; and then, in an unthinking moment, I idly turned the\r\nleaves, and began to indolently study diseases, generally. I forget\r\nwhich was the first distemper I plunged into\xe2\x80\x94some fearful, devastating\r\nscourge, I know\xe2\x80\x94and, before I had glanced half down the list of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpremonitory symptoms,\xe2\x80\x9d it was borne in upon me that I had fairly got\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the listlessness of\r\ndespair, I again turned over the pages. I came to typhoid fever\xe2\x80\x94read\r\nthe symptoms\xe2\x80\x94discovered that I had typhoid fever, must have had it\r\nfor months without knowing it\xe2\x80\x94wondered what else I had got; turned up\r\nSt. Vitus\xe2\x80\x99s Dance\xe2\x80\x94found, as I expected, that I had that too,\xe2\x80\x94began to\r\nget interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom,\r\nand so started alphabetically\xe2\x80\x94read up ague, and learnt that I was\r\nsickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about\r\nanother fortnight. Bright\xe2\x80\x99s disease, I was relieved to find, I had only\r\nin a modified form, and, so far as that was concerned, I might live\r\nfor years. Cholera I had, with severe complications; and diphtheria I\r\nseemed to have been born with. I plodded conscientiously through the\r\ntwenty-six letters, and the only malady I could conclude I had not got\r\nwas housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s knee.\r\n\r\nI felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a\r\nsort of slight. Why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I got housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s knee? Why this invidious\r\nreservation? After a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.\r\nI reflected that I had every other known malady in the pharmacology,\r\nand I grew less selfish, and determined to do without housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknee. Gout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized\r\nme without my being aware of it; and zymosis I had evidently been\r\nsuffering with from boyhood. There were no more diseases after zymosis,\r\nso I concluded there was nothing else the matter with me.\r\n\r\nI sat and pondered. I thought what an interesting case I must be from\r\na medical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class!\r\nStudents would have no need to \xe2\x80\x9cwalk the hospitals,\xe2\x80\x9d if they had me. I\r\nwas a hospital in myself. All they need do would be to walk round me,\r\nand, after that, take their diploma.\r\n\r\nThen I wondered how long I had to live. I tried to examine myself. I\r\nfelt my pulse. I could not at first feel any pulse at all. Then, all\r\nof a sudden, it seemed to start off. I pulled out my watch and timed\r\nit. I made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute. I tried to feel\r\nmy heart. I could not feel my heart. It had stopped beating. I have\r\nsince been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there\r\nall the time, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it.\r\nI patted myself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my\r\nhead, and I went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back.\r\nBut I could not feel or hear anything. I tried to look at my tongue. I\r\nstuck it out as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried\r\nto examine it with the other. I could only see the tip, and the only\r\nthing that I could gain from that was to feel more certain than before\r\nthat I had scarlet fever.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Man with walking stick] I had walked into that reading-room a\r\nhappy, healthy man. I crawled out a decrepit wreck.\r\n\r\nI went to my medical man. He is an old chum of mine, and feels my\r\npulse, and looks at my tongue, and talks about the weather, all for\r\nnothing, when I fancy I\xe2\x80\x99m ill; so I thought I would do him a good turn\r\nby going to him now. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a doctor wants,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cis practice.\r\nHe shall have me. He will get more practice out of me than out of\r\nseventeen hundred of your ordinary, commonplace patients, with only one\r\nor two diseases each.\xe2\x80\x9d So I went straight up and saw him, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not take up your time, dear boy, with telling you what is the\r\nmatter with me. Life is brief, and you might pass away before I had\r\nfinished. But I will tell you what is _not_ the matter with me. I have\r\nnot got housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s knee. Why I have not got housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s knee, I cannot\r\ntell you; but the fact remains that I have not got it. Everything else,\r\nhowever, I _have_ got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I told him how I came to discover it all.\r\n\r\nThen he opened me and looked down me, and clutched hold of my wrist,\r\nand then he hit me over the chest when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting it\xe2\x80\x94a cowardly\r\nthing to do, I call it\xe2\x80\x94and immediately afterwards butted me with the\r\nside of his head. After that, he sat down and wrote out a prescription,\r\nand folded it up and gave it me, and I put it in my pocket and went out.\r\n\r\nI did not open it. I took it to the nearest chemist\xe2\x80\x99s, and handed it\r\nin. The man read it, and then handed it back.\r\n\r\nHe said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep it.\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a chemist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a chemist. If I was a co-operative stores and family hotel\r\ncombined, I might be able to oblige you. Being only a chemist hampers\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI read the prescription. It ran:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c1 lb. beefsteak, with\r\n    1 pt. bitter beer\r\n\r\n                                                          every 6 hours.\r\n\r\n    1 ten-mile walk every morning.\r\n\r\n    1 bed at 11 sharp every night.\r\n\r\n    And don\xe2\x80\x99t stuff up your head with things you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI followed the directions, with the happy result\xe2\x80\x94speaking for\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94that my life was preserved, and is still going on.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, going back to the liver-pill circular, I had\r\nthe symptoms, beyond all mistake, the chief among them being \xe2\x80\x9ca general\r\ndisinclination to work of any kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat I suffer in that way no tongue can tell. From my earliest infancy\r\nI have been a martyr to it. As a boy, the disease hardly ever left\r\nme for a day. They did not know, then, that it was my liver. Medical\r\nscience was in a far less advanced state than now, and they used to put\r\nit down to laziness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you skulking little devil, you,\xe2\x80\x9d they would say, \xe2\x80\x9cget up and do\r\nsomething for your living, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not knowing, of course, that I\r\nwas ill.\r\n\r\nAnd they didn\xe2\x80\x99t give me pills; they gave me clumps on the side of the\r\nhead. And, strange as it may appear, those clumps on the head often\r\ncured me\xe2\x80\x94for the time being. I have known one clump on the head have\r\nmore effect upon my liver, and make me feel more anxious to go straight\r\naway then and there, and do what was wanted to be done, without further\r\nloss of time, than a whole box of pills does now.\r\n\r\nYou know, it often is so\xe2\x80\x94those simple, old-fashioned remedies are\r\nsometimes more efficacious than all the dispensary stuff.\r\n\r\nWe sat there for half-an-hour, describing to each other our maladies. I\r\nexplained to George and William Harris how I felt when I got up in the\r\nmorning, and William Harris told us how he felt when he went to bed;\r\nand George stood on the hearth-rug, and gave us a clever and powerful\r\npiece of acting, illustrative of how he felt in the night.\r\n\r\nGeorge _fancies_ he is ill; but there\xe2\x80\x99s never anything really the\r\nmatter with him, you know.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Mrs. Poppets knocked at the door to know if we were\r\nready for supper. We smiled sadly at one another, and said we supposed\r\nwe had better try to swallow a bit. Harris said a little something in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s stomach often kept the disease in check; and Mrs. Poppets brought\r\nthe tray in, and we drew up to the table, and toyed with a little steak\r\nand onions, and some rhubarb tart.\r\n\r\nI must have been very weak at the time; because I know, after the first\r\nhalf-hour or so, I seemed to take no interest whatever in my food\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nunusual thing for me\xe2\x80\x94and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any cheese.\r\n\r\nThis duty done, we refilled our glasses, lit our pipes, and resumed\r\nthe discussion upon our state of health. What it was that was actually\r\nthe matter with us, we none of us could be sure of; but the unanimous\r\nopinion was that it\xe2\x80\x94whatever it was\xe2\x80\x94had been brought on by overwork.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we want is rest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRest and a complete change,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cThe overstrain upon our\r\nbrains has produced a general depression throughout the system. Change\r\nof scene, and absence of the necessity for thought, will restore the\r\nmental equilibrium.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge has a cousin, who is usually described in the charge-sheet\r\nas a medical student, so that he naturally has a somewhat\r\nfamily-physicianary way of putting things.\r\n\r\nI agreed with George, and suggested that we should seek out some\r\nretired and old-world spot, far from the madding crowd, and dream\r\naway a sunny week among its drowsy lanes\xe2\x80\x94some half-forgotten nook,\r\nhidden away by the fairies, out of reach of the noisy world\xe2\x80\x94some\r\nquaint-perched eyrie on the cliffs of Time, from whence the surging\r\nwaves of the nineteenth century would sound far-off and faint.\r\n\r\nHarris said he thought it would be humpy. He said he knew the sort of\r\nplace I meant; where everybody went to bed at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a _Referee_ for love or money, and had to walk ten miles\r\nto get your baccy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cif you want rest and change, you can\xe2\x80\x99t beat a sea\r\ntrip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI objected to the sea trip strongly. A sea trip does you good when you\r\nare going to have a couple of months of it, but, for a week, it is\r\nwicked.\r\n\r\nYou start on Monday with the idea implanted in your bosom that you\r\nare going to enjoy yourself. You wave an airy adieu to the boys on\r\nshore, light your biggest pipe, and swagger about the deck as if you\r\nwere Captain Cook, Sir Francis Drake, and Christopher Columbus all\r\nrolled into one. On Tuesday, you wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come. On Wednesday,\r\nThursday, and Friday, you wish you were dead. On Saturday, you are able\r\nto swallow a little beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with\r\na wan, sweet smile when kind-hearted people ask you how you feel now.\r\nOn Sunday, you begin to walk about again, and take solid food. And on\r\nMonday morning, as, with your bag and umbrella in your hand, you stand\r\nby the gunwale, waiting to step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.\r\n\r\nI remember my brother-in-law going for a short sea trip once, for the\r\nbenefit of his health. He took a return berth from London to Liverpool;\r\nand when he got to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was\r\nto sell that return ticket.\r\n\r\nIt was offered round the town at a tremendous reduction, so I am told;\r\nand was eventually sold for eighteenpence to a bilious-looking youth\r\nwho had just been advised by his medical men to go to the sea-side, and\r\ntake exercise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSea-side!\xe2\x80\x9d said my brother-in-law, pressing the ticket affectionately\r\ninto his hand; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have enough to last you a lifetime; and as\r\nfor exercise! why, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get more exercise, sitting down on that ship,\r\nthan you would turning somersaults on dry land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe himself\xe2\x80\x94my brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x94came back by train. He said the\r\nNorth-Western Railway was healthy enough for him.\r\n\r\nAnother fellow I knew went for a week\xe2\x80\x99s voyage round the coast, and,\r\nbefore they started, the steward came to him to ask whether he would\r\npay for each meal as he had it, or arrange beforehand for the whole\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nThe steward recommended the latter course, as it would come so much\r\ncheaper. He said they would do him for the whole week at two pounds\r\nfive. He said for breakfast there would be fish, followed by a grill.\r\nLunch was at one, and consisted of four courses. Dinner at six\xe2\x80\x94soup,\r\nfish, entree, joint, poultry, salad, sweets, cheese, and dessert. And a\r\nlight meat supper at ten.\r\n\r\nMy friend thought he would close on the two-pound-five job (he is a\r\nhearty eater), and did so.\r\n\r\nLunch came just as they were off Sheerness. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so hungry\r\nas he thought he should, and so contented himself with a bit of boiled\r\nbeef, and some strawberries and cream. He pondered a good deal during\r\nthe afternoon, and at one time it seemed to him that he had been eating\r\nnothing but boiled beef for weeks, and at other times it seemed that he\r\nmust have been living on strawberries and cream for years.\r\n\r\nNeither the beef nor the strawberries and cream seemed happy,\r\neither\xe2\x80\x94seemed discontented like.\r\n\r\nAt six, they came and told him dinner was ready. The announcement\r\naroused no enthusiasm within him, but he felt that there was some of\r\nthat two-pound-five to be worked off, and he held on to ropes and\r\nthings and went down. A pleasant odour of onions and hot ham, mingled\r\nwith fried fish and greens, greeted him at the bottom of the ladder;\r\nand then the steward came up with an oily smile, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I get you, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Picture: Man feeling ill] \xe2\x80\x9cGet me out of this,\xe2\x80\x9d was the feeble reply.\r\n\r\nAnd they ran him up quick, and propped him up, over to leeward, and\r\nleft him.\r\n\r\nFor the next four days he lived a simple and blameless life on thin\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s biscuits (I mean that the biscuits were thin, not the\r\ncaptain) and soda-water; but, towards Saturday, he got uppish, and went\r\nin for weak tea and dry toast, and on Monday he was gorging himself on\r\nchicken broth. He left the ship on Tuesday, and as it steamed away from\r\nthe landing-stage he gazed after it regretfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she goes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere she goes, with two pounds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of\r\nfood on board that belongs to me, and that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said that if they had given him another day he thought he could have\r\nput it straight.\r\n\r\nSo I set my face against the sea trip. Not, as I explained, upon my\r\nown account. I was never queer. But I was afraid for George. George\r\nsaid he should be all right, and would rather like it, but he would\r\nadvise Harris and me not to think of it, as he felt sure we should\r\nboth be ill. Harris said that, to himself, it was always a mystery how\r\npeople managed to get sick at sea\xe2\x80\x94said he thought people must do it on\r\npurpose, from affectation\xe2\x80\x94said he had often wished to be, but had never\r\nbeen able.\r\n\r\nThen he told us anecdotes of how he had gone across the Channel when it\r\nwas so rough that the passengers had to be tied into their berths, and\r\nhe and the captain were the only two living souls on board who were not\r\nill. Sometimes it was he and the second mate who were not ill; but it\r\nwas generally he and one other man. If not he and another man, then it\r\nwas he by himself.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, but nobody ever is sea-sick\xe2\x80\x94on land. At sea, you\r\ncome across plenty of people very bad indeed, whole boat-loads of them;\r\nbut I never met a man yet, on land, who had ever known at all what it\r\nwas to be sea-sick. Where the thousands upon thousands of bad sailors\r\nthat swarm in every ship hide themselves when they are on land is a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nIf most men were like a fellow I saw on the Yarmouth boat one day, I\r\ncould account for the seeming enigma easily enough. It was just off\r\nSouthend Pier, I recollect, and he was leaning out through one of the\r\nport-holes in a very dangerous position. I went up to him to try and\r\nsave him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! come further in,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, shaking him by the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\noverboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh my! I wish I was,\xe2\x80\x9d was the only answer I could get; and there I had\r\nto leave him.\r\n\r\nThree weeks afterwards, I met him in the coffee-room of a Bath hotel,\r\ntalking about his voyages, and explaining, with enthusiasm, how he\r\nloved the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood sailor!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied in answer to a mild young man\xe2\x80\x99s envious\r\nquery; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, I did feel a little queer _once_, I confess. It was off\r\nCape Horn. The vessel was wrecked the next morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWeren\xe2\x80\x99t you a little shaky by Southend Pier one day, and wanted to be\r\nthrown overboard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouthend Pier!\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with a puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; going down to Yarmouth, last Friday three weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ah\xe2\x80\x94yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, brightening up; \xe2\x80\x9cI remember now. I did have\r\na headache that afternoon. It was the pickles, you know. They were the\r\nmost disgraceful pickles I ever tasted in a respectable boat. Did _you_\r\nhave any?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor myself, I have discovered an excellent preventive against\r\nsea-sickness, in balancing myself. You stand in the centre of the deck,\r\nand, as the ship heaves and pitches, you move your body about, so as\r\nto keep it always straight. When the front of the ship rises, you lean\r\nforward, till the deck almost touches your nose; and when its back end\r\ngets up, you lean backwards. This is all very well for an hour or two;\r\nbut you can\xe2\x80\x99t balance yourself for a week.\r\n\r\nGeorge said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go up the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said we should have fresh air, exercise and quiet; the constant\r\nchange of scene would occupy our minds (including what there was of\r\nHarris\xe2\x80\x99s); and the hard work would give us a good appetite, and make us\r\nsleep well.\r\n\r\nHarris said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think George ought to do anything that would\r\nhave a tendency to make him sleepier than he always was, as it might\r\nbe dangerous. He said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t very well understand how George was\r\ngoing to sleep any more than he did now, seeing that there were only\r\ntwenty-four hours in each day, summer and winter alike; but thought\r\nthat if he _did_ sleep any more, he might just as well be dead, and so\r\nsave his board and lodging.\r\n\r\nHarris said, however, that the river would suit him to a \xe2\x80\x9cT.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what a \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d is (except a sixpenny one, which includes\r\nbread-and-butter and cake _ad lib._, and is cheap at the price, if you\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t had any dinner). It seems to suit everybody, however, which is\r\ngreatly to its credit.\r\n\r\nIt suited me to a \xe2\x80\x9cT\xe2\x80\x9d too, and Harris and I both said it was a good\r\nidea of George\xe2\x80\x99s; and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply\r\nthat we were surprised that George should have come out so sensible.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Montmorency] The only one who was not struck with the\r\nsuggestion was Montmorency. He never did care for the river, did\r\nMontmorency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for you fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d he says; \xe2\x80\x9cyou like it, but _I_\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for me to do. Scenery is not in my line, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t smoke. If I see a rat, you won\xe2\x80\x99t stop; and if I go to sleep, you\r\nget fooling about with the boat, and slop me overboard. If you ask me,\r\nI call the whole thing bally foolishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were three to one, however, and the motion was carried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlans discussed.\xe2\x80\x94Pleasures of \xe2\x80\x9ccamping-out,\xe2\x80\x9d on fine nights.\xe2\x80\x94Ditto, wet\r\nnights.\xe2\x80\x94Compromise decided on.\xe2\x80\x94Montmorency, first impressions of.\xe2\x80\x94Fears\r\nlest he is too good for this world, fears subsequently dismissed as\r\ngroundless.\xe2\x80\x94Meeting adjourns.\r\n\r\nWe pulled out the maps, and discussed plans.\r\n\r\nWe arranged to start on the following Saturday from Kingston. Harris\r\nand I would go down in the morning, and take the boat up to Chertsey,\r\nand George, who would not be able to get away from the City till the\r\nafternoon (George goes to sleep at a bank from ten to four each day,\r\nexcept Saturdays, when they wake him up and put him outside at two),\r\nwould meet us there.\r\n\r\nShould we \xe2\x80\x9ccamp out\xe2\x80\x9d or sleep at inns?\r\n\r\nGeorge and I were for camping out. We said it would be so wild and\r\nfree, so patriarchal like.\r\n\r\nSlowly the golden memory of the dead sun fades from the hearts of the\r\ncold, sad clouds. Silent, like sorrowing children, the birds have\r\nceased their song, and only the moorhen\xe2\x80\x99s plaintive cry and the harsh\r\ncroak of the corncrake stirs the awed hush around the couch of waters,\r\nwhere the dying day breathes out her last.\r\n\r\nFrom the dim woods on either bank, Night\xe2\x80\x99s ghostly army, the grey\r\nshadows, creep out with noiseless tread to chase away the lingering\r\nrear-guard of the light, and pass, with noiseless, unseen feet, above\r\nthe waving river-grass, and through the sighing rushes; and Night,\r\nupon her sombre throne, folds her black wings above the darkening\r\nworld, and, from her phantom palace, lit by the pale stars, reigns in\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: River scene]\r\n\r\nThen we run our little boat into some quiet nook, and the tent is\r\npitched, and the frugal supper cooked and eaten. Then the big pipes\r\nare filled and lighted, and the pleasant chat goes round in musical\r\nundertone; while, in the pauses of our talk, the river, playing round\r\nthe boat, prattles strange old tales and secrets, sings low the old\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s song that it has sung so many thousand years\xe2\x80\x94will sing so many\r\nthousand years to come, before its voice grows harsh and old\xe2\x80\x94a song\r\nthat we, who have learnt to love its changing face, who have so often\r\nnestled on its yielding bosom, think, somehow, we understand, though we\r\ncould not tell you in mere words the story that we listen to.\r\n\r\nAnd we sit there, by its margin, while the moon, who loves it too,\r\nstoops down to kiss it with a sister\xe2\x80\x99s kiss, and throws her silver arms\r\naround it clingingly; and we watch it as it flows, ever singing, ever\r\nwhispering, out to meet its king, the sea\xe2\x80\x94till our voices die away in\r\nsilence, and the pipes go out\xe2\x80\x94till we, common-place, everyday young men\r\nenough, feel strangely full of thoughts, half sad, half sweet, and do\r\nnot care or want to speak\xe2\x80\x94till we laugh, and, rising, knock the ashes\r\nfrom our burnt-out pipes, and say \xe2\x80\x9cGood-night,\xe2\x80\x9d and, lulled by the\r\nlapping water and the rustling trees, we fall asleep beneath the great,\r\nstill stars, and dream that the world is young again\xe2\x80\x94young and sweet\r\nas she used to be ere the centuries of fret and care had furrowed her\r\nfair face, ere her children\xe2\x80\x99s sins and follies had made old her loving\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94sweet as she was in those bygone days when, a new-made mother,\r\nshe nursed us, her children, upon her own deep breast\xe2\x80\x94ere the wiles\r\nof painted civilization had lured us away from her fond arms, and the\r\npoisoned sneers of artificiality had made us ashamed of the simple life\r\nwe led with her, and the simple, stately home where mankind was born so\r\nmany thousands years ago.\r\n\r\nHarris said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow about when it rained?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou can never rouse Harris. There is no poetry about Harris\xe2\x80\x94no wild\r\nyearning for the unattainable. Harris never \xe2\x80\x9cweeps, he knows not why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIf Harris\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fill with tears, you can bet it is because Harris has\r\nbeen eating raw onions, or has put too much Worcester over his chop.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Mermaid] If you were to stand at night by the sea-shore with\r\nHarris, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark! do you not hear? Is it but the mermaids singing deep below the\r\nwaving waters; or sad spirits, chanting dirges for white corpses, held\r\nby seaweed?\xe2\x80\x9d Harris would take you by the arm, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know what it is, old man; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a chill. Now, you come along\r\nwith me. I know a place round the corner here, where you can get a drop\r\nof the finest Scotch whisky you ever tasted\xe2\x80\x94put you right in less than\r\nno time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris always does know a place round the corner where you can get\r\nsomething brilliant in the drinking line. I believe that if you met\r\nHarris up in Paradise (supposing such a thing likely), he would\r\nimmediately greet you with:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come, old fellow; I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a nice place round the\r\ncorner here, where you can get some really first-class nectar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, however, as regarded the camping out, his\r\npractical view of the matter came as a very timely hint. Camping out in\r\nrainy weather is not pleasant.\r\n\r\nIt is evening. You are wet through, and there is a good two inches of\r\nwater in the boat, and all the things are damp. You find a place on the\r\nbanks that is not quite so puddly as other places you have seen, and\r\nyou land and lug out the tent, and two of you proceed to fix it.\r\n\r\nIt is soaked and heavy, and it flops about, and tumbles down on you,\r\nand clings round your head and makes you mad. The rain is pouring\r\nsteadily down all the time. It is difficult enough to fix a tent in dry\r\nweather: in wet, the task becomes herculean. Instead of helping you, it\r\nseems to you that the other man is simply playing the fool. Just as you\r\nget your side beautifully fixed, he gives it a hoist from his end, and\r\nspoils it all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! what are you up to?\xe2\x80\x9d you call out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are _you_ up to?\xe2\x80\x9d he retorts; \xe2\x80\x9cleggo, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t pull it; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it all wrong, you stupid ass!\xe2\x80\x9d you shout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he yells back; \xe2\x80\x9clet go your side!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it all wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d you roar, wishing that you could\r\nget at him; and you give your ropes a lug that pulls all his pegs out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the bally idiot!\xe2\x80\x9d you hear him mutter to himself; and then comes\r\na savage haul, and away goes your side. You lay down the mallet and\r\nstart to go round and tell him what you think about the whole business,\r\nand, at the same time, he starts round in the same direction to come\r\nand explain his views to you. And you follow each other round and\r\nround, swearing at one another, until the tent tumbles down in a heap,\r\nand leaves you looking at each other across its ruins, when you both\r\nindignantly exclaim, in the same breath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are! what did I tell you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the third man, who has been baling out the boat, and who has\r\nspilled the water down his sleeve, and has been cursing away to himself\r\nsteadily for the last ten minutes, wants to know what the thundering\r\nblazes you\xe2\x80\x99re playing at, and why the blarmed tent isn\xe2\x80\x99t up yet.\r\n\r\nAt last, somehow or other, it does get up, and you land the things. It\r\nis hopeless attempting to make a wood fire, so you light the methylated\r\nspirit stove, and crowd round that.\r\n\r\nRainwater is the chief article of diet at supper. The bread is\r\ntwo-thirds rainwater, the beefsteak-pie is exceedingly rich in it, and\r\nthe jam, and the butter, and the salt, and the coffee have all combined\r\nwith it to make soup.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, you find your tobacco is damp, and you cannot smoke.\r\nLuckily you have a bottle of the stuff that cheers and inebriates, if\r\ntaken in proper quantity, and this restores to you sufficient interest\r\nin life to induce you to go to bed.\r\n\r\nThere you dream that an elephant has suddenly sat down on your chest,\r\nand that the volcano has exploded and thrown you down to the bottom\r\nof the sea\xe2\x80\x94the elephant still sleeping peacefully on your bosom. You\r\nwake up and grasp the idea that something terrible really has happened.\r\nYour first impression is that the end of the world has come; and then\r\nyou think that this cannot be, and that it is thieves and murderers,\r\nor else fire, and this opinion you express in the usual method. No\r\nhelp comes, however, and all you know is that thousands of people are\r\nkicking you, and you are being smothered.\r\n\r\nSomebody else seems in trouble, too. You can hear his faint cries\r\ncoming from underneath your bed. Determining, at all events, to sell\r\nyour life dearly, you struggle frantically, hitting out right and\r\nleft with arms and legs, and yelling lustily the while, and at last\r\nsomething gives way, and you find your head in the fresh air. Two feet\r\noff, you dimly observe a half-dressed ruffian, waiting to kill you,\r\nand you are preparing for a life-and-death struggle with him, when it\r\nbegins to dawn upon you that it\xe2\x80\x99s Jim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he says, recognising you at the same moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d you answer, rubbing your eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBally tent\xe2\x80\x99s blown down, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s Bill?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen you both raise up your voices and shout for \xe2\x80\x9cBill!\xe2\x80\x9d and the ground\r\nbeneath you heaves and rocks, and the muffled voice that you heard\r\nbefore replies from out the ruin:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet off my head, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Bill struggles out, a muddy, trampled wreck, and in an\r\nunnecessarily aggressive mood\xe2\x80\x94he being under the evident belief that\r\nthe whole thing has been done on purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the morning you are all three speechless, owing to having caught\r\nsevere colds in the night; you also feel very quarrelsome, and you\r\nswear at each other in hoarse whispers during the whole of breakfast\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe therefore decided that we would sleep out on fine nights; and hotel\r\nit, and inn it, and pub. it, like respectable folks, when it was wet,\r\nor when we felt inclined for a change.\r\n\r\nMontmorency hailed this compromise with much approval. He does not\r\nrevel in romantic solitude. Give him something noisy; and if a trifle\r\nlow, so much the jollier. To look at Montmorency you would imagine\r\nthat he was an angel sent upon the earth, for some reason withheld\r\nfrom mankind, in the shape of a small fox-terrier. There is a sort of\r\nOh-what-a-wicked-world-this-is-and-how-I-wish-I-could-do-something-to-\r\nmake-it-better-and-nobler expression about Montmorency that has\r\nbeen known to bring the tears into the eyes of pious old ladies and\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nWhen first he came to live at my expense, I never thought I should be\r\nable to get him to stop long. I used to sit down and look at him, as he\r\nsat on the rug and looked up at me, and think: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that dog will never\r\nlive. He will be snatched up to the bright skies in a chariot, that is\r\nwhat will happen to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, when I had paid for about a dozen chickens that he had killed;\r\nand had dragged him, growling and kicking, by the scruff of his neck,\r\nout of a hundred and fourteen street fights; and had had a dead cat\r\nbrought round for my inspection by an irate female, who called me\r\na murderer; and had been summoned by the man next door but one for\r\nhaving a ferocious dog at large, that had kept him pinned up in his own\r\ntool-shed, afraid to venture his nose outside the door for over two\r\nhours on a cold night; and had learned that the gardener, unknown to\r\nmyself, had won thirty shillings by backing him to kill rats against\r\ntime, then I began to think that maybe they\xe2\x80\x99d let him remain on earth\r\nfor a bit longer, after all.\r\n\r\nTo hang about a stable, and collect a gang of the most disreputable\r\ndogs to be found in the town, and lead them out to march round the\r\nslums to fight other disreputable dogs, is Montmorency\xe2\x80\x99s idea of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clife;\xe2\x80\x9d and so, as I before observed, he gave to the suggestion of\r\ninns, and pubs., and hotels his most emphatic approbation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled the sleeping arrangements to the satisfaction of\r\nall four of us, the only thing left to discuss was what we should take\r\nwith us; and this we had begun to argue, when Harris said he\xe2\x80\x99d had\r\nenough oratory for one night, and proposed that we should go out and\r\nhave a smile, saying that he had found a place, round by the square,\r\nwhere you could really get a drop of Irish worth drinking.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Whisky glass] George said he felt thirsty (I never knew\r\nGeorge when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t); and, as I had a presentiment that a little\r\nwhisky, warm, with a slice of lemon, would do my complaint good, the\r\ndebate was, by common assent, adjourned to the following night; and the\r\nassembly put on its hats and went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrangements settled.\xe2\x80\x94Harris\xe2\x80\x99s method of doing work.\xe2\x80\x94How the elderly,\r\nfamily-man puts up a picture.\xe2\x80\x94George makes a sensible, remark.\xe2\x80\x94Delights\r\nof early morning bathing.\xe2\x80\x94Provisions for getting upset.\r\n\r\nSo, on the following evening, we again assembled, to discuss and\r\narrange our plans. Harris said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, the first thing to settle is what to take with us. Now, you get\r\na bit of paper and write down, J., and you get the grocery catalogue,\r\nGeorge, and somebody give me a bit of pencil, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll make out a\r\nlist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s Harris all over\xe2\x80\x94so ready to take the burden of everything\r\nhimself, and put it on the backs of other people.\r\n\r\nHe always reminds me of my poor Uncle Podger. You never saw such a\r\ncommotion up and down a house, in all your life, as when my Uncle\r\nPodger undertook to do a job. A picture would have come home from the\r\nframe-maker\xe2\x80\x99s, and be standing in the dining-room, waiting to be put\r\nup; and Aunt Podger would ask what was to be done with it, and Uncle\r\nPodger would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you leave that to _me_. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you, any of you, worry yourselves\r\nabout that. _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ do all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he would take off his coat, and begin. He would send the girl\r\nout for sixpen\xe2\x80\x99orth of nails, and then one of the boys after her to\r\ntell her what size to get; and, from that, he would gradually work\r\ndown, and start the whole house.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Candle] \xe2\x80\x9cNow you go and get me my hammer, Will,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nwould shout; \xe2\x80\x9cand you bring me the rule, Tom; and I shall want the\r\nstep-ladder, and I had better have a kitchen-chair, too; and, Jim! you\r\nrun round to Mr. Goggles, and tell him, \xe2\x80\x98Pa\xe2\x80\x99s kind regards, and hopes\r\nhis leg\xe2\x80\x99s better; and will he lend him his spirit-level?\xe2\x80\x99 And don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ngo, Maria, because I shall want somebody to hold me the light; and when\r\nthe girl comes back, she must go out again for a bit of picture-cord;\r\nand Tom!\xe2\x80\x94where\xe2\x80\x99s Tom?\xe2\x80\x94Tom, you come here; I shall want you to hand me\r\nup the picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he would lift up the picture, and drop it, and it would come\r\nout of the frame, and he would try to save the glass, and cut himself;\r\nand then he would spring round the room, looking for his handkerchief.\r\nHe could not find his handkerchief, because it was in the pocket of the\r\ncoat he had taken off, and he did not know where he had put the coat,\r\nand all the house had to leave off looking for his tools, and start\r\nlooking for his coat; while he would dance round and hinder them.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Nails etc.] \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t anybody in the whole house know where my\r\ncoat is? I never came across such a set in all my life\xe2\x80\x94upon my word I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t. Six of you!\xe2\x80\x94and you can\xe2\x80\x99t find a coat that I put down not five\r\nminutes ago! Well, of all the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he\xe2\x80\x99d get up, and find that he had been sitting on it, and would\r\ncall out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you can give it up! I\xe2\x80\x99ve found it myself now. Might just as well\r\nask the cat to find anything as expect you people to find it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, when half an hour had been spent in tying up his finger, and a\r\nnew glass had been got, and the tools, and the ladder, and the chair,\r\nand the candle had been brought, he would have another go, the whole\r\nfamily, including the girl and the charwoman, standing round in a\r\nsemi-circle, ready to help. Two people would have to hold the chair,\r\nand a third would help him up on it, and hold him there, and a fourth\r\nwould hand him a nail, and a fifth would pass him up the hammer, and he\r\nwould take hold of the nail, and drop it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, in an injured tone, \xe2\x80\x9cnow the nail\xe2\x80\x99s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd we would all have to go down on our knees and grovel for it, while\r\nhe would stand on the chair, and grunt, and want to know if he was to\r\nbe kept there all the evening.\r\n\r\nThe nail would be found at last, but by that time he would have lost\r\nthe hammer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the hammer? What did I do with the hammer? Great heavens!\r\nSeven of you, gaping round there, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I did with\r\nthe hammer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe would find the hammer for him, and then he would have lost sight of\r\nthe mark he had made on the wall, where the nail was to go in, and each\r\nof us had to get up on the chair, beside him, and see if we could find\r\nit; and we would each discover it in a different place, and he would\r\ncall us all fools, one after another, and tell us to get down. And\r\nhe would take the rule, and re-measure, and find that he wanted half\r\nthirty-one and three-eighths inches from the corner, and would try to\r\ndo it in his head, and go mad.\r\n\r\nAnd we would all try to do it in our heads, and all arrive at different\r\nresults, and sneer at one another. And in the general row, the original\r\nnumber would be forgotten, and Uncle Podger would have to measure it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHe would use a bit of string this time, and at the critical moment,\r\nwhen the old fool was leaning over the chair at an angle of forty-five,\r\nand trying to reach a point three inches beyond what was possible for\r\nhim to reach, the string would slip, and down he would slide on to the\r\npiano, a really fine musical effect being produced by the suddenness\r\nwith which his head and body struck all the notes at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnd Aunt Maria would say that she would not allow the children to stand\r\nround and hear such language.\r\n\r\nAt last, Uncle Podger would get the spot fixed again, and put the point\r\nof the nail on it with his left hand, and take the hammer in his right\r\nhand. And, with the first blow, he would smash his thumb, and drop the\r\nhammer, with a yell, on somebody\xe2\x80\x99s toes.\r\n\r\nAunt Maria would mildly observe that, next time Uncle Podger was going\r\nto hammer a nail into the wall, she hoped he\xe2\x80\x99d let her know in time, so\r\nthat she could make arrangements to go and spend a week with her mother\r\nwhile it was being done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! you women, you make such a fuss over everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncle Podger\r\nwould reply, picking himself up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I _like_ doing a little job of\r\nthis sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                [Picture: Uncle Podger admiring his work]\r\n\r\nAnd then he would have another try, and, at the second blow, the nail\r\nwould go clean through the plaster, and half the hammer after it,\r\nand Uncle Podger be precipitated against the wall with force nearly\r\nsufficient to flatten his nose.\r\n\r\nThen we had to find the rule and the string again, and a new hole was\r\nmade; and, about midnight, the picture would be up\xe2\x80\x94very crooked and\r\ninsecure, the wall for yards round looking as if it had been smoothed\r\ndown with a rake, and everybody dead beat and wretched\xe2\x80\x94except Uncle\r\nPodger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, stepping heavily off the chair on to\r\nthe charwoman\xe2\x80\x99s corns, and surveying the mess he had made with evident\r\npride. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, some people would have had a man in to do a little thing\r\nlike that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris will be just that sort of man when he grows up, I know, and I\r\ntold him so. I said I could not permit him to take so much labour upon\r\nhimself. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; _you_ get the paper, and the pencil, and the catalogue, and George\r\nwrite down, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first list we made out had to be discarded. It was clear that the\r\nupper reaches of the Thames would not allow of the navigation of a boat\r\nsufficiently large to take the things we had set down as indispensable;\r\nso we tore the list up, and looked at one another!\r\n\r\nGeorge said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know we are on a wrong track altogether. We must not think of\r\nthe things we could do with, but only of the things that we can\xe2\x80\x99t do\r\nwithout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge comes out really quite sensible at times. You\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised. I\r\ncall that downright wisdom, not merely as regards the present case, but\r\nwith reference to our trip up the river of life, generally. How many\r\npeople, on that voyage, load up the boat till it is ever in danger of\r\nswamping with a store of foolish things which they think essential to\r\nthe pleasure and comfort of the trip, but which are really only useless\r\nlumber.\r\n\r\nHow they pile the poor little craft mast-high with fine clothes and big\r\nhouses; with useless servants, and a host of swell friends that do not\r\ncare twopence for them, and that they do not care three ha\xe2\x80\x99pence for;\r\nwith expensive entertainments that nobody enjoys, with formalities and\r\nfashions, with pretence and ostentation, and with\xe2\x80\x94oh, heaviest, maddest\r\nlumber of all!\xe2\x80\x94the dread of what will my neighbour think, with luxuries\r\nthat only cloy, with pleasures that bore, with empty show that, like\r\nthe criminal\xe2\x80\x99s iron crown of yore, makes to bleed and swoon the aching\r\nhead that wears it!\r\n\r\nIt is lumber, man\xe2\x80\x94all lumber! Throw it overboard. It makes the boat so\r\nheavy to pull, you nearly faint at the oars. It makes it so cumbersome\r\nand dangerous to manage, you never know a moment\xe2\x80\x99s freedom from anxiety\r\nand care, never gain a moment\xe2\x80\x99s rest for dreamy laziness\xe2\x80\x94no time to\r\nwatch the windy shadows skimming lightly o\xe2\x80\x99er the shallows, or the\r\nglittering sunbeams flitting in and out among the ripples, or the great\r\ntrees by the margin looking down at their own image, or the woods all\r\ngreen and golden, or the lilies white and yellow, or the sombre-waving\r\nrushes, or the sedges, or the orchis, or the blue forget-me-nots.\r\n\r\nThrow the lumber over, man! Let your boat of life be light, packed\r\nwith only what you need\xe2\x80\x94a homely home and simple pleasures, one or two\r\nfriends, worth the name, someone to love and someone to love you, a\r\ncat, a dog, and a pipe or two, enough to eat and enough to wear, and a\r\nlittle more than enough to drink; for thirst is a dangerous thing.\r\n\r\nYou will find the boat easier to pull then, and it will not be so\r\nliable to upset, and it will not matter so much if it does upset; good,\r\nplain merchandise will stand water. You will have time to think as well\r\nas to work. Time to drink in life\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine\xe2\x80\x94time to listen to the\r\n\xc3\x86olian music that the wind of God draws from the human heart-strings\r\naround us\xe2\x80\x94time to\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nI beg your pardon, really. I quite forgot.\r\n\r\nWell, we left the list to George, and he began it.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Tent] \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t take a tent,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested George; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will have\r\na boat with a cover. It is ever so much simpler, and more comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed a good thought, and we adopted it. I do not know whether you\r\nhave ever seen the thing I mean. You fix iron hoops up over the boat,\r\nand stretch a huge canvas over them, and fasten it down all round,\r\nfrom stem to stern, and it converts the boat into a sort of little\r\nhouse, and it is beautifully cosy, though a trifle stuffy; but there,\r\neverything has its drawbacks, as the man said when his mother-in-law\r\ndied, and they came down upon him for the funeral expenses.\r\n\r\nGeorge said that in that case we must take a rug each, a lamp, some\r\nsoap, a brush and comb (between us), a toothbrush (each), a basin,\r\nsome tooth-powder, some shaving tackle (sounds like a French exercise,\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?), and a couple of big-towels for bathing. I notice that\r\npeople always make gigantic arrangements for bathing when they are\r\ngoing anywhere near the water, but that they don\xe2\x80\x99t bathe much when they\r\nare there.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Sea-side scene] It is the same when you go to the sea-side. I\r\nalways determine\xe2\x80\x94when thinking over the matter in London\xe2\x80\x94that I\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nup early every morning, and go and have a dip before breakfast, and I\r\nreligiously pack up a pair of drawers and a bath towel. I always get\r\nred bathing drawers. I rather fancy myself in red drawers. They suit\r\nmy complexion so. But when I get to the sea I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel somehow that\r\nI want that early morning bathe nearly so much as I did when I was in\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I feel more that I want to stop in bed till the last\r\nmoment, and then come down and have my breakfast. Once or twice virtue\r\nhas triumphed, and I have got out at six and half-dressed myself, and\r\nhave taken my drawers and towel, and stumbled dismally off. But I\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t enjoyed it. They seem to keep a specially cutting east wind,\r\nwaiting for me, when I go to bathe in the early morning; and they pick\r\nout all the three-cornered stones, and put them on the top, and they\r\nsharpen up the rocks and cover the points over with a bit of sand so\r\nthat I can\xe2\x80\x99t see them, and they take the sea and put it two miles out,\r\nso that I have to huddle myself up in my arms and hop, shivering,\r\nthrough six inches of water. And when I do get to the sea, it is rough\r\nand quite insulting.\r\n\r\nOne huge wave catches me up and chucks me in a sitting posture, as hard\r\nas ever it can, down on to a rock which has been put there for me. And,\r\nbefore I\xe2\x80\x99ve said \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Ugh!\xe2\x80\x9d and found out what has gone, the wave comes\r\nback and carries me out to mid-ocean. I begin to strike out frantically\r\nfor the shore, and wonder if I shall ever see home and friends again,\r\nand wish I\xe2\x80\x99d been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was a\r\nboy, I mean). Just when I have given up all hope, a wave retires and\r\nleaves me sprawling like a star-fish on the sand, and I get up and look\r\nback and find that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been swimming for my life in two feet of water.\r\nI hop back and dress, and crawl home, where I have to pretend I liked\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance, we all talked as if we were going to have a\r\nlong swim every morning.\r\n\r\nGeorge said it was so pleasant to wake up in the boat in the fresh\r\nmorning, and plunge into the limpid river. Harris said there was\r\nnothing like a swim before breakfast to give you an appetite. He said\r\nit always gave him an appetite. George said that if it was going to\r\nmake Harris eat more than Harris ordinarily ate, then he should protest\r\nagainst Harris having a bath at all.\r\n\r\nHe said there would be quite enough hard work in towing sufficient food\r\nfor Harris up against stream, as it was.\r\n\r\nI urged upon George, however, how much pleasanter it would be to have\r\nHarris clean and fresh about the boat, even if we did have to take a\r\nfew more hundredweight of provisions; and he got to see it in my light,\r\nand withdrew his opposition to Harris\xe2\x80\x99s bath.\r\n\r\nAgreed, finally, that we should take _three_ bath towels, so as not to\r\nkeep each other waiting.\r\n\r\nFor clothes, George said two suits of flannel would be sufficient, as\r\nwe could wash them ourselves, in the river, when they got dirty. We\r\nasked him if he had ever tried washing flannels in the river, and he\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not exactly himself like; but he knew some fellows who\r\nhad, and it was easy enough;\xe2\x80\x9d and Harris and I were weak enough to\r\nfancy he knew what he was talking about, and that three respectable\r\nyoung men, without position or influence, and with no experience in\r\nwashing, could really clean their own shirts and trousers in the river\r\nThames with a bit of soap.\r\n\r\nWe were to learn in the days to come, when it was too late, that George\r\nwas a miserable impostor, who could evidently have known nothing\r\nwhatever about the matter. If you had seen these clothes after\xe2\x80\x94but, as\r\nthe shilling shockers say, we anticipate.\r\n\r\nGeorge impressed upon us to take a change of under-things and plenty\r\nof socks, in case we got upset and wanted a change; also plenty of\r\nhandkerchiefs, as they would do to wipe things, and a pair of leather\r\nboots as well as our boating shoes, as we should want them if we got\r\nupset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe food question.\xe2\x80\x94Objections to paraffine oil as an\r\natmosphere.\xe2\x80\x94Advantages of cheese as a travelling companion.\xe2\x80\x94A married\r\nwoman deserts her home.\xe2\x80\x94Further provision for getting upset.\xe2\x80\x94I\r\npack.\xe2\x80\x94Cussedness of tooth-brushes.\xe2\x80\x94George and Harris pack.\xe2\x80\x94Awful\r\nbehaviour of Montmorency.\xe2\x80\x94We retire to rest.\r\n\r\nThen we discussed the food question. George said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegin with breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d (George is so practical.) \xe2\x80\x9cNow for breakfast\r\nwe shall want a frying-pan\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94(Harris said it was indigestible; but we\r\nmerely urged him not to be an ass, and George went on)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca tea-pot and a\r\nkettle, and a methylated spirit stove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo oil,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with a significant look; and Harris and I agreed.\r\n\r\nWe had taken up an oil-stove once, but \xe2\x80\x9cnever again.\xe2\x80\x9d It had been like\r\nliving in an oil-shop that week. It oozed. I never saw such a thing as\r\nparaffine oil is to ooze. We kept it in the nose of the boat, and, from\r\nthere, it oozed down to the rudder, impregnating the whole boat and\r\neverything in it on its way, and it oozed over the river, and saturated\r\nthe scenery and spoilt the atmosphere. Sometimes a westerly oily wind\r\nblew, and at other times an easterly oily wind, and sometimes it blew\r\na northerly oily wind, and maybe a southerly oily wind; but whether it\r\ncame from the Arctic snows, or was raised in the waste of the desert\r\nsands, it came alike to us laden with the fragrance of paraffine oil.\r\n\r\nAnd that oil oozed up and ruined the sunset; and as for the moonbeams,\r\nthey positively reeked of paraffine.\r\n\r\nWe tried to get away from it at Marlow. We left the boat by the bridge,\r\nand took a walk through the town to escape it, but it followed us. The\r\nwhole town was full of oil. We passed through the church-yard, and it\r\nseemed as if the people had been buried in oil. The High Street stunk\r\nof oil; we wondered how people could live in it. And we walked miles\r\nupon miles out Birmingham way; but it was no use, the country was\r\nsteeped in oil.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that trip we met together at midnight in a lonely field,\r\nunder a blasted oak, and took an awful oath (we had been swearing for a\r\nwhole week about the thing in an ordinary, middle-class way, but this\r\nwas a swell affair)\xe2\x80\x94an awful oath never to take paraffine oil with us\r\nin a boat again-except, of course, in case of sickness.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the present instance, we confined ourselves to methylated\r\nspirit. Even that is bad enough. You get methylated pie and methylated\r\ncake. But methylated spirit is more wholesome when taken into the\r\nsystem in large quantities than paraffine oil.\r\n\r\nFor other breakfast things, George suggested eggs and bacon, which were\r\neasy to cook, cold meat, tea, bread and butter, and jam. For lunch, he\r\nsaid, we could have biscuits, cold meat, bread and butter, and jam\xe2\x80\x94but\r\n_no cheese_. Cheese, like oil, makes too much of itself. It wants the\r\nwhole boat to itself. It goes through the hamper, and gives a cheesy\r\nflavour to everything else there. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell whether you are eating\r\napple-pie or German sausage, or strawberries and cream. It all seems\r\ncheese. There is too much odour about cheese.\r\n\r\nI remember a friend of mine, buying a couple of cheeses at Liverpool.\r\nSplendid cheeses they were, ripe and mellow, and with a two hundred\r\nhorse-power scent about them that might have been warranted to carry\r\nthree miles, and knock a man over at two hundred yards. I was in\r\nLiverpool at the time, and my friend said that if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind he\r\nwould get me to take them back with me to London, as he should not be\r\ncoming up for a day or two himself, and he did not think the cheeses\r\nought to be kept much longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, with pleasure, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cwith pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI called for the cheeses, and took them away in a cab. It was a\r\nramshackle affair, dragged along by a knock-kneed, broken-winded\r\nsomnambulist, which his owner, in a moment of enthusiasm, during\r\nconversation, referred to as a horse. I put the cheeses on the top,\r\nand we started off at a shamble that would have done credit to the\r\nswiftest steam-roller ever built, and all went merry as a funeral\r\nbell, until we turned the corner. There, the wind carried a whiff from\r\nthe cheeses full on to our steed. It woke him up, and, with a snort\r\nof terror, he dashed off at three miles an hour. The wind still blew\r\nin his direction, and before we reached the end of the street he was\r\nlaying himself out at the rate of nearly four miles an hour, leaving\r\nthe cripples and stout old ladies simply nowhere.\r\n\r\nIt took two porters as well as the driver to hold him in at the\r\nstation; and I do not think they would have done it, even then, had not\r\none of the men had the presence of mind to put a handkerchief over his\r\nnose, and to light a bit of brown paper.\r\n\r\nI took my ticket, and marched proudly up the platform, with my cheeses,\r\nthe people falling back respectfully on either side. The train was\r\ncrowded, and I had to get into a carriage where there were already\r\nseven other people. One crusty old gentleman objected, but I got in,\r\nnotwithstanding; and, putting my cheeses upon the rack, squeezed down\r\nwith a pleasant smile, and said it was a warm day.\r\n\r\nA few moments passed, and then the old gentleman began to fidget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery close in here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite oppressive,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man next him.\r\n\r\nAnd then they both began sniffing, and, at the third sniff, they\r\ncaught it right on the chest, and rose up without another word and\r\nwent out. And then a stout lady got up, and said it was disgraceful\r\nthat a respectable married woman should be harried about in this way,\r\nand gathered up a bag and eight parcels and went. The remaining four\r\npassengers sat on for a while, until a solemn-looking man in the\r\ncorner, who, from his dress and general appearance, seemed to belong\r\nto the undertaker class, said it put him in mind of dead baby; and the\r\nother three passengers tried to get out of the door at the same time,\r\nand hurt themselves.\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Railway carriage]\r\n\r\nI smiled at the black gentleman, and said I thought we were going to\r\nhave the carriage to ourselves; and he laughed pleasantly, and said\r\nthat some people made such a fuss over a little thing. But even he\r\ngrew strangely depressed after we had started, and so, when we reached\r\nCrewe, I asked him to come and have a drink. He accepted, and we forced\r\nour way into the buffet, where we yelled, and stamped, and waved our\r\numbrellas for a quarter of an hour; and then a young lady came, and\r\nasked us if we wanted anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, turning to my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have half-a-crown\xe2\x80\x99s worth of brandy, neat, if you please, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe responded.\r\n\r\nAnd he went off quietly after he had drunk it and got into another\r\ncarriage, which I thought mean.\r\n\r\nFrom Crewe I had the compartment to myself, though the train was\r\ncrowded. As we drew up at the different stations, the people, seeing\r\nmy empty carriage, would rush for it. \xe2\x80\x9cHere y\xe2\x80\x99 are, Maria; come along,\r\nplenty of room.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Tom; we\xe2\x80\x99ll get in here,\xe2\x80\x9d they would shout.\r\nAnd they would run along, carrying heavy bags, and fight round the\r\ndoor to get in first. And one would open the door and mount the steps,\r\nand stagger back into the arms of the man behind him; and they would\r\nall come and have a sniff, and then droop off and squeeze into other\r\ncarriages, or pay the difference and go first.\r\n\r\nFrom Euston, I took the cheeses down to my friend\xe2\x80\x99s house. When his\r\nwife came into the room she smelt round for an instant. Then she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Tell me the worst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s cheeses. Tom bought them in Liverpool, and asked me to bring them\r\nup with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I added that I hoped she understood that it had nothing to do with\r\nme; and she said that she was sure of that, but that she would speak to\r\nTom about it when he came back.\r\n\r\nMy friend was detained in Liverpool longer than he expected; and, three\r\ndays later, as he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t returned home, his wife called on me. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did Tom say about those cheeses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied that he had directed they were to be kept in a moist place,\r\nand that nobody was to touch them.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s likely to touch them. Had he smelt them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought he had, and added that he seemed greatly attached to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think he would be upset,\xe2\x80\x9d she queried, \xe2\x80\x9cif I gave a man a\r\nsovereign to take them away and bury them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered that I thought he would never smile again.\r\n\r\nAn idea struck her. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind keeping them for him? Let me send them round to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cfor myself I like the smell of cheese, and the\r\njourney the other day with them from Liverpool I shall ever look back\r\nupon as a happy ending to a pleasant holiday. But, in this world, we\r\nmust consider others. The lady under whose roof I have the honour of\r\nresiding is a widow, and, for all I know, possibly an orphan too. She\r\nhas a strong, I may say an eloquent, objection to being what she terms\r\n\xe2\x80\x98put upon.\xe2\x80\x99 The presence of your husband\xe2\x80\x99s cheeses in her house she\r\nwould, I instinctively feel, regard as a \xe2\x80\x98put upon\xe2\x80\x99; and it shall never\r\nbe said that I put upon the widow and the orphan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend\xe2\x80\x99s wife, rising, \xe2\x80\x9call I have to say\r\nis, that I shall take the children and go to an hotel until those\r\ncheeses are eaten. I decline to live any longer in the same house with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe kept her word, leaving the place in charge of the charwoman, who,\r\nwhen asked if she could stand the smell, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat smell?\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwho, when taken close to the cheeses and told to sniff hard, said she\r\ncould detect a faint odour of melons. It was argued from this that\r\nlittle injury could result to the woman from the atmosphere, and she\r\nwas left.\r\n\r\nThe hotel bill came to fifteen guineas; and my friend, after reckoning\r\neverything up, found that the cheeses had cost him eight-and-sixpence\r\na pound. He said he dearly loved a bit of cheese, but it was beyond\r\nhis means; so he determined to get rid of them. He threw them into the\r\ncanal; but had to fish them out again, as the bargemen complained.\r\nThey said it made them feel quite faint. And, after that, he took them\r\none dark night and left them in the parish mortuary. But the coroner\r\ndiscovered them, and made a fearful fuss.\r\n\r\nHe said it was a plot to deprive him of his living by waking up the\r\ncorpses.\r\n\r\nMy friend got rid of them, at last, by taking them down to a sea-side\r\ntown, and burying them on the beach. It gained the place quite a\r\nreputation. Visitors said they had never noticed before how strong the\r\nair was, and weak-chested and consumptive people used to throng there\r\nfor years afterwards.\r\n\r\nFond as I am of cheese, therefore, I hold that George was right in\r\ndeclining to take any.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shan\xe2\x80\x99t want any tea,\xe2\x80\x9d said George (Harris\xe2\x80\x99s face fell at this);\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good round, square, slap-up meal at seven\xe2\x80\x94dinner,\r\ntea, and supper combined.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris grew more cheerful. George suggested meat and fruit pies,\r\ncold meat, tomatoes, fruit, and green stuff. For drink, we took some\r\nwonderful sticky concoction of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s, which you mixed with water and\r\ncalled lemonade, plenty of tea, and a bottle of whisky, in case, as\r\nGeorge said, we got upset.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that George harped too much on the getting-upset idea.\r\nIt seemed to me the wrong spirit to go about the trip in.\r\n\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we took the whisky.\r\n\r\nWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t take beer or wine. They are a mistake up the river. They make\r\nyou feel sleepy and heavy. A glass in the evening when you are doing a\r\nmouch round the town and looking at the girls is all right enough; but\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t drink when the sun is blazing down on your head, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nhard work to do.\r\n\r\nWe made a list of the things to be taken, and a pretty lengthy one it\r\nwas, before we parted that evening. The next day, which was Friday, we\r\ngot them all together, and met in the evening to pack. We got a big\r\nGladstone for the clothes, and a couple of hampers for the victuals and\r\nthe cooking utensils. We moved the table up against the window, piled\r\neverything in a heap in the middle of the floor, and sat round and\r\nlooked at it.\r\n\r\nI said I\xe2\x80\x99d pack.\r\n\r\nI rather pride myself on my packing. Packing is one of those many\r\nthings that I feel I know more about than any other person living. (It\r\nsurprises me myself, sometimes, how many of these subjects there are.)\r\nI impressed the fact upon George and Harris, and told them that they\r\nhad better leave the whole matter entirely to me. They fell into the\r\nsuggestion with a readiness that had something uncanny about it. George\r\nput on a pipe and spread himself over the easy-chair, and Harris cocked\r\nhis legs on the table and lit a cigar.\r\n\r\nThis was hardly what I intended. What I had meant, of course, was, that\r\nI should boss the job, and that Harris and George should potter about\r\nunder my directions, I pushing them aside every now and then with, \xe2\x80\x9cOh,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHere, let me do it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere you are, simple enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94really\r\nteaching them, as you might say. Their taking it in the way they did\r\nirritated me. There is nothing does irritate me more than seeing other\r\npeople sitting about doing nothing when I\xe2\x80\x99m working.\r\n\r\nI lived with a man once who used to make me mad that way. He would loll\r\non the sofa and watch me doing things by the hour together, following\r\nme round the room with his eyes, wherever I went. He said it did him\r\nreal good to look on at me, messing about. He said it made him feel\r\nthat life was not an idle dream to be gaped and yawned through, but a\r\nnoble task, full of duty and stern work. He said he often wondered now\r\nhow he could have gone on before he met me, never having anybody to\r\nlook at while they worked.\r\n\r\nNow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not like that. I can\xe2\x80\x99t sit still and see another man slaving\r\nand working. I want to get up and superintend, and walk round with\r\nmy hands in my pockets, and tell him what to do. It is my energetic\r\nnature. I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did not say anything, but started the packing. It seemed a\r\nlonger job than I had thought it was going to be; but I got the bag\r\nfinished at last, and I sat on it and strapped it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t you going to put the boots in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\nAnd I looked round, and found I had forgotten them. That\xe2\x80\x99s just like\r\nHarris. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said a word until I\xe2\x80\x99d got the bag shut and\r\nstrapped, of course. And George laughed\xe2\x80\x94one of those irritating,\r\nsenseless, chuckle-headed, crack-jawed laughs of his. They do make me\r\nso wild.\r\n\r\nI opened the bag and packed the boots in; and then, just as I was\r\ngoing to close it, a horrible idea occurred to me. Had I packed my\r\ntooth-brush? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is, but I never do know whether I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\npacked my tooth-brush.\r\n\r\nMy tooth-brush is a thing that haunts me when I\xe2\x80\x99m travelling, and\r\nmakes my life a misery. I dream that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t packed it, and wake up\r\nin a cold perspiration, and get out of bed and hunt for it. And, in\r\nthe morning, I pack it before I have used it, and have to unpack again\r\nto get it, and it is always the last thing I turn out of the bag; and\r\nthen I repack and forget it, and have to rush upstairs for it at the\r\nlast moment and carry it to the railway station, wrapped up in my\r\npocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Boot] Of course I had to turn every mortal thing out now,\r\nand, of course, I could not find it. I rummaged the things up into much\r\nthe same state that they must have been before the world was created,\r\nand when chaos reigned. Of course, I found George\xe2\x80\x99s and Harris\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neighteen times over, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find my own. I put the things back\r\none by one, and held everything up and shook it. Then I found it inside\r\na boot. I repacked once more.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, George asked if the soap was in. I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncare a hang whether the soap was in or whether it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t; and I\r\nslammed the bag to and strapped it, and found that I had packed my\r\ntobacco-pouch in it, and had to re-open it. It got shut up finally at\r\n10.05 p.m., and then there remained the hampers to do. Harris said that\r\nwe should be wanting to start in less than twelve hours\xe2\x80\x99 time, and\r\nthought that he and George had better do the rest; and I agreed and sat\r\ndown, and they had a go.\r\n\r\nThey began in a light-hearted spirit, evidently intending to show me\r\nhow to do it. I made no comment; I only waited. When George is hanged,\r\nHarris will be the worst packer in this world; and I looked at the\r\npiles of plates and cups, and kettles, and bottles and jars, and pies,\r\nand stoves, and cakes, and tomatoes, &c., and felt that the thing would\r\nsoon become exciting.\r\n\r\nIt did. They started with breaking a cup. That was the first thing they\r\ndid. They did that just to show you what they _could_ do, and to get\r\nyou interested.\r\n\r\nThen Harris packed the strawberry jam on top of a tomato and squashed\r\nit, and they had to pick out the tomato with a teaspoon.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was George\xe2\x80\x99s turn, and he trod on the butter. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanything, but I came over and sat on the edge of the table and watched\r\nthem. It irritated them more than anything I could have said. I felt\r\nthat. It made them nervous and excited, and they stepped on things, and\r\nput things behind them, and then couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find them when they wanted\r\nthem; and they packed the pies at the bottom, and put heavy things on\r\ntop, and smashed the pies in.\r\n\r\nThey upset salt over everything, and as for the butter! I never saw two\r\nmen do more with one-and-twopence worth of butter in my whole life than\r\nthey did. After George had got it off his slipper, they tried to put it\r\nin the kettle. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go in, and what _was_ in wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come out.\r\nThey did scrape it out at last, and put it down on a chair, and Harris\r\nsat on it, and it stuck to him, and they went looking for it all over\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath I put it down on that chair,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, staring\r\nat the empty seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw you do it myself, not a minute ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\nThen they started round the room again looking for it; and then they\r\nmet again in the centre, and stared at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost extraordinary thing I ever heard of,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo mysterious!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\nThen George got round at the back of Harris and saw it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here it is all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harris, spinning round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStand still, can\xe2\x80\x99t you!\xe2\x80\x9d roared George, flying after him.\r\n\r\nAnd they got it off, and packed it in the teapot.\r\n\r\nMontmorency was in it all, of course. Montmorency\xe2\x80\x99s ambition in life,\r\nis to get in the way and be sworn at. If he can squirm in anywhere\r\nwhere he particularly is not wanted, and be a perfect nuisance, and\r\nmake people mad, and have things thrown at his head, then he feels his\r\nday has not been wasted.\r\n\r\nTo get somebody to stumble over him, and curse him steadily for an\r\nhour, is his highest aim and object; and, when he has succeeded in\r\naccomplishing this, his conceit becomes quite unbearable.\r\n\r\nHe came and sat down on things, just when they were wanted to be\r\npacked; and he laboured under the fixed belief that, whenever Harris\r\nor George reached out their hand for anything, it was his cold, damp\r\nnose that they wanted. He put his leg into the jam, and he worried the\r\nteaspoons, and he pretended that the lemons were rats, and got into the\r\nhamper and killed three of them before Harris could land him with the\r\nfrying-pan.\r\n\r\nHarris said I encouraged him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t encourage him. A dog like that\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want any encouragement. It\xe2\x80\x99s the natural, original sin that is\r\nborn in him that makes him do things like that.\r\n\r\nThe packing was done at 12.50; and Harris sat on the big hamper, and\r\nsaid he hoped nothing would be found broken. George said that if\r\nanything was broken it was broken, which reflection seemed to comfort\r\nhim. He also said he was ready for bed. We were all ready for bed.\r\nHarris was to sleep with us that night, and we went upstairs.\r\n\r\nWe tossed for beds, and Harris had to sleep with me. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you prefer the inside or the outside, J.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I generally preferred to sleep _inside_ a bed.\r\n\r\nHarris said it was old.\r\n\r\nGeorge said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat time shall I wake you fellows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94six,\xe2\x80\x9d because I wanted to write some letters.\r\n\r\nHarris and I had a bit of a row over it, but at last split the\r\ndifference, and said half-past six.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWake us at 6.30, George,\xe2\x80\x9d we said.\r\n\r\nGeorge made no answer, and we found, on going over, that he had been\r\nasleep for some time; so we placed the bath where he could tumble into\r\nit on getting out in the morning, and went to bed ourselves.\r\n\r\n                    [Picture: Luggage with dog on top]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. P. arouses us.\xe2\x80\x94George, the sluggard.\xe2\x80\x94The \xe2\x80\x9cweather forecast\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nswindle.\xe2\x80\x94Our luggage.\xe2\x80\x94Depravity of the small boy.\xe2\x80\x94The people\r\ngather round us.\xe2\x80\x94We drive off in great style, and arrive at\r\nWaterloo.\xe2\x80\x94Innocence of South Western Officials concerning such worldly\r\nthings as trains.\xe2\x80\x94We are afloat, afloat in an open boat.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Mrs. Poppets] It was Mrs. Poppets that woke me up next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nShe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that it\xe2\x80\x99s nearly nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine o\xe2\x80\x99 what?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, starting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, through the keyhole. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was\r\na-oversleeping yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI woke Harris, and told him. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you wanted to get up at six?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I did,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you wake me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I wake you, when you didn\xe2\x80\x99t wake me?\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\nwe shan\xe2\x80\x99t get on the water till after twelve. I wonder you take the\r\ntrouble to get up at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUm,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9clucky for you that I do. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t woke you, you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave lain there for the whole fortnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Picture: George snoring] We snarled at one another in this strain for\r\nthe next few minutes, when we were interrupted by a defiant snore from\r\nGeorge. It reminded us, for the first time since our being called, of\r\nhis existence. There he lay\xe2\x80\x94the man who had wanted to know what time\r\nhe should wake us\xe2\x80\x94on his back, with his mouth wide open, and his knees\r\nstuck up.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it should be, I am sure; but the sight of another man\r\nasleep in bed when I am up, maddens me. It seems to me so shocking to\r\nsee the precious hours of a man\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94the priceless moments that will\r\nnever come back to him again\xe2\x80\x94being wasted in mere brutish sleep.\r\n\r\nThere was George, throwing away in hideous sloth the inestimable gift\r\nof time; his valuable life, every second of which he would have to\r\naccount for hereafter, passing away from him, unused. He might have\r\nbeen up stuffing himself with eggs and bacon, irritating the dog,\r\nor flirting with the slavey, instead of sprawling there, sunk in\r\nsoul-clogging oblivion.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible thought. Harris and I appeared to be struck by it\r\nat the same instant. We determined to save him, and, in this noble\r\nresolve, our own dispute was forgotten. We flew across and slung the\r\nclothes off him, and Harris landed him one with a slipper, and I\r\nshouted in his ear, and he awoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWasermarrer?\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, sitting up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet up, you fat-headed chunk!\xe2\x80\x9d roared Harris. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quarter to ten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d he shrieked, jumping out of bed into the bath; \xe2\x80\x9cWho the thunder\r\nput this thing here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe told him he must have been a fool not to see the bath.\r\n\r\nWe finished dressing, and, when it came to the extras, we remembered\r\nthat we had packed the tooth-brushes and the brush and comb (that\r\ntooth-brush of mine will be the death of me, I know), and we had to go\r\ndownstairs, and fish them out of the bag. And when we had done that\r\nGeorge wanted the shaving tackle. We told him that he would have to go\r\nwithout shaving that morning, as we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to unpack that bag\r\nagain for him, nor for anyone like him.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd. How can I go into the City like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was certainly rather rough on the City, but what cared we for human\r\nsuffering? As Harris said, in his common, vulgar way, the City would\r\nhave to lump it.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Two dogs and umbrella] We went downstairs to breakfast.\r\nMontmorency had invited two other dogs to come and see him off, and\r\nthey were whiling away the time by fighting on the doorstep. We calmed\r\nthem with an umbrella, and sat down to chops and cold beef.\r\n\r\nHarris said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing is to make a good breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d and he started with a\r\ncouple of chops, saying that he would take these while they were hot,\r\nas the beef could wait.\r\n\r\nGeorge got hold of the paper, and read us out the boating fatalities,\r\nand the weather forecast, which latter prophesied \xe2\x80\x9crain, cold, wet\r\nto fine\xe2\x80\x9d (whatever more than usually ghastly thing in weather that\r\nmay be), \xe2\x80\x9coccasional local thunder-storms, east wind, with general\r\ndepression over the Midland Counties (London and Channel). Bar.\r\nfalling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI do think that, of all the silly, irritating tomfoolishness by which\r\nwe are plagued, this \xe2\x80\x9cweather-forecast\xe2\x80\x9d fraud is about the most\r\naggravating. It \xe2\x80\x9cforecasts\xe2\x80\x9d precisely what happened yesterday or the\r\nday before, and precisely the opposite of what is going to happen\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nI remember a holiday of mine being completely ruined one late autumn\r\nby our paying attention to the weather report of the local newspaper.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHeavy showers, with thunderstorms, may be expected to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d it would\r\nsay on Monday, and so we would give up our picnic, and stop indoors\r\nall day, waiting for the rain.\xe2\x80\x94And people would pass the house, going\r\noff in wagonettes and coaches as jolly and merry as could be, the sun\r\nshining out, and not a cloud to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d we said, as we stood looking out at them through the window,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t they come home soaked!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd we chuckled to think how wet they were going to get, and came back\r\nand stirred the fire, and got our books, and arranged our specimens of\r\nseaweed and cockle shells. By twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, with the sun pouring into\r\nthe room, the heat became quite oppressive, and we wondered when those\r\nheavy showers and occasional thunderstorms were going to begin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! they\xe2\x80\x99ll come in the afternoon, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find,\xe2\x80\x9d we said to each\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ those people get wet. What a lark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the landlady would come in to ask if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t going\r\nout, as it seemed such a lovely day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d we replied, with a knowing chuckle, \xe2\x80\x9cnot we. _We_ don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\nto get wet\xe2\x80\x94no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd when the afternoon was nearly gone, and still there was no sign of\r\nrain, we tried to cheer ourselves up with the idea that it would come\r\ndown all at once, just as the people had started for home, and were out\r\nof the reach of any shelter, and that they would thus get more drenched\r\nthan ever. But not a drop ever fell, and it finished a grand day, and a\r\nlovely night after it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we would read that it was going to be a \xe2\x80\x9cwarm, fine\r\nto set-fair day; much heat;\xe2\x80\x9d and we would dress ourselves in flimsy\r\nthings, and go out, and, half-an-hour after we had started, it would\r\ncommence to rain hard, and a bitterly cold wind would spring up, and\r\nboth would keep on steadily for the whole day, and we would come home\r\nwith colds and rheumatism all over us, and go to bed.\r\n\r\nThe weather is a thing that is beyond me altogether. I never can\r\nunderstand it. The barometer is useless: it is as misleading as the\r\nnewspaper forecast.\r\n\r\nThere was one hanging up in a hotel at Oxford at which I was staying\r\nlast spring, and, when I got there, it was pointing to \xe2\x80\x9cset fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nIt was simply pouring with rain outside, and had been all day; and I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make matters out. I tapped the barometer, and it jumped\r\nup and pointed to \xe2\x80\x9cvery dry.\xe2\x80\x9d The Boots stopped as he was passing,\r\nand said he expected it meant to-morrow. I fancied that maybe it was\r\nthinking of the week before last, but Boots said, No, he thought not.\r\n\r\nI tapped it again the next morning, and it went up still higher, and\r\nthe rain came down faster than ever. On Wednesday I went and hit it\r\nagain, and the pointer went round towards \xe2\x80\x9cset fair,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cvery dry,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmuch heat,\xe2\x80\x9d until it was stopped by the peg, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go any\r\nfurther. It tried its best, but the instrument was built so that it\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t prophesy fine weather any harder than it did without breaking\r\nitself. It evidently wanted to go on, and prognosticate drought, and\r\nwater famine, and sunstroke, and simooms, and such things, but the\r\npeg prevented it, and it had to be content with pointing to the mere\r\ncommonplace \xe2\x80\x9cvery dry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rain came down in a steady torrent, and the lower part\r\nof the town was under water, owing to the river having overflowed.\r\n\r\nBoots said it was evident that we were going to have a prolonged spell\r\nof grand weather _some time_, and read out a poem which was printed\r\nover the top of the oracle, about\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cLong foretold, long last;\r\n    Short notice, soon past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fine weather never came that summer. I expect that machine must\r\nhave been referring to the following spring.\r\n\r\nThen there are those new style of barometers, the long straight ones.\r\nI never can make head or tail of those. There is one side for 10 a.m.\r\nyesterday, and one side for 10 a.m. to-day; but you can\xe2\x80\x99t always get\r\nthere as early as ten, you know. It rises or falls for rain and fine,\r\nwith much or less wind, and one end is \xe2\x80\x9cNly\xe2\x80\x9d and the other \xe2\x80\x9cEly\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(what\xe2\x80\x99s Ely got to do with it?), and if you tap it, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you\r\nanything. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to correct it to sea-level, and reduce it to\r\nFahrenheit, and even then I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.\r\n\r\nBut who wants to be foretold the weather? It is bad enough when it\r\ncomes, without our having the misery of knowing about it beforehand.\r\nThe prophet we like is the old man who, on the particularly\r\ngloomy-looking morning of some day when we particularly want it to be\r\nfine, looks round the horizon with a particularly knowing eye, and says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, sir, I think it will clear up all right. It will break all\r\nright enough, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, he knows\xe2\x80\x9d, we say, as we wish him good-morning, and start off;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwonderful how these old fellows can tell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd we feel an affection for that man which is not at all lessened by\r\nthe circumstances of its _not_ clearing up, but continuing to rain\r\nsteadily all day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, well,\xe2\x80\x9d we feel, \xe2\x80\x9che did his best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor the man that prophesies us bad weather, on the contrary, we\r\nentertain only bitter and revengeful thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to clear up, d\xe2\x80\x99ye think?\xe2\x80\x9d we shout, cheerily, as we pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no, sir; I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s settled down for the day,\xe2\x80\x9d he replies,\r\nshaking his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid old fool!\xe2\x80\x9d we mutter, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s _he_ know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d And, if\r\nhis portent proves correct, we come back feeling still more angry\r\nagainst him, and with a vague notion that, somehow or other, he has had\r\nsomething to do with it.\r\n\r\nIt was too bright and sunny on this especial morning for George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood-curdling readings about \xe2\x80\x9cBar. falling,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9catmospheric disturbance,\r\npassing in an oblique line over Southern Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpressure\r\nincreasing,\xe2\x80\x9d to very much upset us: and so, finding that he could\r\nnot make us wretched, and was only wasting his time, he sneaked the\r\ncigarette that I had carefully rolled up for myself, and went.\r\n\r\nThen Harris and I, having finished up the few things left on the table,\r\ncarted out our luggage on to the doorstep, and waited for a cab.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: The luggage]\r\n\r\nThere seemed a good deal of luggage, when we put it all together. There\r\nwas the Gladstone and the small hand-bag, and the two hampers, and a\r\nlarge roll of rugs, and some four or five overcoats and macintoshes,\r\nand a few umbrellas, and then there was a melon by itself in a bag,\r\nbecause it was too bulky to go in anywhere, and a couple of pounds of\r\ngrapes in another bag, and a Japanese paper umbrella, and a frying pan,\r\nwhich, being too long to pack, we had wrapped round with brown paper.\r\n\r\nIt did look a lot, and Harris and I began to feel rather ashamed of it,\r\nthough why we should be, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see. No cab came by, but the street\r\nboys did, and got interested in the show, apparently, and stopped.\r\n\r\nBiggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy was the first to come round. Biggs is our greengrocer, and\r\nhis chief talent lies in securing the services of the most abandoned\r\nand unprincipled errand-boys that civilisation has as yet produced. If\r\nanything more than usually villainous in the boy-line crops up in our\r\nneighbourhood, we know that it is Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s latest. I was told that, at\r\nthe time of the Great Coram Street murder, it was promptly concluded by\r\nour street that Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy (for that period) was at the bottom of it,\r\nand had he not been able, in reply to the severe cross-examination to\r\nwhich he was subjected by No. 19, when he called there for orders the\r\nmorning after the crime (assisted by No. 21, who happened to be on the\r\nstep at the time), to prove a complete _alibi_, it would have gone hard\r\nwith him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy at that time, but, from what I have\r\nseen of them since, I should not have attached much importance to that\r\n_alibi_ myself.\r\n\r\nBiggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy, as I have said, came round the corner. He was evidently in\r\na great hurry when he first dawned upon the vision, but, on catching\r\nsight of Harris and me, and Montmorency, and the things, he eased up\r\nand stared. Harris and I frowned at him. This might have wounded a\r\nmore sensitive nature, but Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s boys are not, as a rule, touchy.\r\nHe came to a dead stop, a yard from our step, and, leaning up against\r\nthe railings, and selecting a straw to chew, fixed us with his eye. He\r\nevidently meant to see this thing out.\r\n\r\nIn another moment, the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy passed on the opposite side of the\r\nstreet. Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy hailed him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! ground floor o\xe2\x80\x99 42\xe2\x80\x99s a-moving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe grocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy came across, and took up a position on the other side\r\nof the step. Then the young gentleman from the boot-shop stopped, and\r\njoined Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy; while the empty-can superintendent from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blue\r\nPosts\xe2\x80\x9d took up an independent position on the curb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to starve, are they?\xe2\x80\x9d said the gentleman from the\r\nboot-shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you\xe2\x80\x99d want to take a thing or two with _you_,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blue\r\nPosts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cif you was a-going to cross the Atlantic in a small boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t a-going to cross the Atlantic,\xe2\x80\x9d struck in Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re a-going to find Stanley.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, quite a small crowd had collected, and people were asking\r\neach other what was the matter. One party (the young and giddy portion\r\nof the crowd) held that it was a wedding, and pointed out Harris as\r\nthe bridegroom; while the elder and more thoughtful among the populace\r\ninclined to the idea that it was a funeral, and that I was probably the\r\ncorpse\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\r\n\r\nAt last, an empty cab turned up (it is a street where, as a rule,\r\nand when they are not wanted, empty cabs pass at the rate of three a\r\nminute, and hang about, and get in your way), and packing ourselves\r\nand our belongings into it, and shooting out a couple of Montmorency\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends, who had evidently sworn never to forsake him, we drove away\r\namidst the cheers of the crowd, Biggs\xe2\x80\x99s boy shying a carrot after us\r\nfor luck.\r\n\r\nWe got to Waterloo at eleven, and asked where the eleven-five started\r\nfrom. Of course nobody knew; nobody at Waterloo ever does know where a\r\ntrain is going to start from, or where a train when it does start is\r\ngoing to, or anything about it. The porter who took our things thought\r\nit would go from number two platform, while another porter, with whom\r\nhe discussed the question, had heard a rumour that it would go from\r\nnumber one. The station-master, on the other hand, was convinced it\r\nwould start from the local.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to the matter, we went upstairs, and asked the traffic\r\nsuperintendent, and he told us that he had just met a man, who said he\r\nhad seen it at number three platform. We went to number three platform,\r\nbut the authorities there said that they rather thought that train was\r\nthe Southampton express, or else the Windsor loop. But they were sure\r\nit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Kingston train, though why they were sure it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\r\n\r\nThen our porter said he thought that must be it on the high-level\r\nplatform; said he thought he knew the train. So we went to the\r\nhigh-level platform, and saw the engine-driver, and asked him if he\r\nwas going to Kingston. He said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say for certain of course,\r\nbut that he rather thought he was. Anyhow, if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the 11.5 for\r\nKingston, he said he was pretty confident he was the 9.32 for Virginia\r\nWater, or the 10 a.m. express for the Isle of Wight, or somewhere in\r\nthat direction, and we should all know when we got there. We slipped\r\nhalf-a-crown into his hand, and begged him to be the 11.5 for Kingston.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody will ever know, on this line,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you are, or\r\nwhere you\xe2\x80\x99re going. You know the way, you slip off quietly and go to\r\nKingston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, gents,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the noble fellow, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I suppose\r\n_some_ train\xe2\x80\x99s got to go to Kingston; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. Gimme the\r\nhalf-crown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus we got to Kingston by the London and South-Western Railway.\r\n\r\nWe learnt, afterwards, that the train we had come by was really the\r\nExeter mail, and that they had spent hours at Waterloo, looking for it,\r\nand nobody knew what had become of it.\r\n\r\nOur boat was waiting for us at Kingston just below bridge, and to it\r\nwe wended our way, and round it we stored our luggage, and into it we\r\nstepped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all right, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight it is,\xe2\x80\x9d we answered; and with Harris at the sculls and I at the\r\ntiller-lines, and Montmorency, unhappy and deeply suspicious, in the\r\nprow, out we shot on to the waters which, for a fortnight, were to be\r\nour home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nKingston.\xe2\x80\x94Instructive remarks on early English history.\xe2\x80\x94Instructive\r\nobservations on carved oak and life in general.\xe2\x80\x94Sad case of Stivvings,\r\njunior.\xe2\x80\x94Musings on antiquity.\xe2\x80\x94I forget that I am steering.\xe2\x80\x94Interesting\r\nresult.\xe2\x80\x94Hampton Court Maze.\xe2\x80\x94Harris as a guide.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious morning, late spring or early summer, as you care\r\nto take it, when the dainty sheen of grass and leaf is blushing to a\r\ndeeper green; and the year seems like a fair young maid, trembling with\r\nstrange, wakening pulses on the brink of womanhood.\r\n\r\nThe quaint back streets of Kingston, where they came down to the\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x99s edge, looked quite picturesque in the flashing sunlight, the\r\nglinting river with its drifting barges, the wooded towpath, the\r\ntrim-kept villas on the other side, Harris, in a red and orange blazer,\r\ngrunting away at the sculls, the distant glimpses of the grey old\r\npalace of the Tudors, all made a sunny picture, so bright but calm, so\r\nfull of life, and yet so peaceful, that, early in the day though it\r\nwas, I felt myself being dreamily lulled off into a musing fit.\r\n\r\nI mused on Kingston, or \xe2\x80\x9cKyningestun,\xe2\x80\x9d as it was once called in the\r\ndays when Saxon \xe2\x80\x9ckinges\xe2\x80\x9d were crowned there. Great C\xc3\xa6sar crossed the\r\nriver there, and the Roman legions camped upon its sloping uplands.\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, like, in later years, Elizabeth, seems to have stopped\r\neverywhere: only he was more respectable than good Queen Bess; he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t put up at the public-houses.\r\n\r\nShe was nuts on public-houses, was England\xe2\x80\x99s Virgin Queen. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nscarcely a pub. of any attractions within ten miles of London that she\r\ndoes not seem to have looked in at, or stopped at, or slept at, some\r\ntime or other. I wonder now, supposing Harris, say, turned over a new\r\nleaf, and became a great and good man, and got to be Prime Minister,\r\nand died, if they would put up signs over the public-houses that he had\r\npatronised: \xe2\x80\x9cHarris had a glass of bitter in this house;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHarris had\r\ntwo of Scotch cold here in the summer of \xe2\x80\x9988;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHarris was chucked from\r\nhere in December, 1886.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, there would be too many of them! It would be the houses that he had\r\nnever entered that would become famous. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly house in South London\r\nthat Harris never had a drink in!\xe2\x80\x9d The people would flock to it to see\r\nwhat could have been the matter with it.\r\n\r\nHow poor weak-minded King Edwy must have hated Kyningestun! The\r\ncoronation feast had been too much for him. Maybe boar\xe2\x80\x99s head stuffed\r\nwith sugar-plums did not agree with him (it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t with me, I know),\r\nand he had had enough of sack and mead; so he slipped from the noisy\r\nrevel to steal a quiet moonlight hour with his beloved Elgiva.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, from the casement, standing hand-in-hand, they were watching\r\nthe calm moonlight on the river, while from the distant halls the\r\nboisterous revelry floated in broken bursts of faint-heard din and\r\ntumult.\r\n\r\nThen brutal Odo and St. Dunstan force their rude way into the quiet\r\nroom, and hurl coarse insults at the sweet-faced Queen, and drag poor\r\nEdwy back to the loud clamour of the drunken brawl.\r\n\r\nYears later, to the crash of battle-music, Saxon kings and Saxon\r\nrevelry were buried side by side, and Kingston\xe2\x80\x99s greatness passed away\r\nfor a time, to rise once more when Hampton Court became the palace of\r\nthe Tudors and the Stuarts, and the royal barges strained at their\r\nmoorings on the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank, and bright-cloaked gallants swaggered\r\ndown the water-steps to cry: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Ferry, ho! Gadzooks, gramercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMany of the old houses, round about, speak very plainly of those days\r\nwhen Kingston was a royal borough, and nobles and courtiers lived\r\nthere, near their King, and the long road to the palace gates was\r\ngay all day with clanking steel and prancing palfreys, and rustling\r\nsilks and velvets, and fair faces. The large and spacious houses, with\r\ntheir oriel, latticed windows, their huge fireplaces, and their gabled\r\nroofs, breathe of the days of hose and doublet, of pearl-embroidered\r\nstomachers, and complicated oaths. They were upraised in the days \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nmen knew how to build.\xe2\x80\x9d The hard red bricks have only grown more firmly\r\nset with time, and their oak stairs do not creak and grunt when you try\r\nto go down them quietly.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of oak staircases reminds me that there is a magnificent\r\ncarved oak staircase in one of the houses in Kingston. It is a shop\r\nnow, in the market-place, but it was evidently once the mansion of some\r\ngreat personage. A friend of mine, who lives at Kingston, went in there\r\nto buy a hat one day, and, in a thoughtless moment, put his hand in his\r\npocket and paid for it then and there.\r\n\r\nThe shopman (he knows my friend) was naturally a little staggered at\r\nfirst; but, quickly recovering himself, and feeling that something\r\nought to be done to encourage this sort of thing, asked our hero if\r\nhe would like to see some fine old carved oak. My friend said he\r\nwould, and the shopman, thereupon, took him through the shop, and\r\nup the staircase of the house. The balusters were a superb piece of\r\nworkmanship, and the wall all the way up was oak-panelled, with carving\r\nthat would have done credit to a palace.\r\n\r\nFrom the stairs, they went into the drawing-room, which was a large,\r\nbright room, decorated with a somewhat startling though cheerful paper\r\nof a blue ground. There was nothing, however, remarkable about the\r\napartment, and my friend wondered why he had been brought there. The\r\nproprietor went up to the paper, and tapped it. It gave forth a wooden\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOak,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAll carved oak, right up to the ceiling, just the\r\nsame as you saw on the staircase.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, great C\xc3\xa6sar! man,\xe2\x80\x9d expostulated my friend; \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say\r\nyou have covered over carved oak with blue wall-paper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply: \xe2\x80\x9cit was expensive work. Had to match-board it all\r\nover first, of course. But the room looks cheerful now. It was awful\r\ngloomy before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I altogether blame the man (which is doubtless a great\r\nrelief to his mind). From his point of view, which would be that of the\r\naverage householder, desiring to take life as lightly as possible, and\r\nnot that of the old-curiosity-shop maniac, there is reason on his side.\r\nCarved oak is very pleasant to look at, and to have a little of, but it\r\nis no doubt somewhat depressing to live in, for those whose fancy does\r\nnot lie that way. It would be like living in a church.\r\n\r\nNo, what was sad in his case was that he, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for carved\r\noak, should have his drawing-room panelled with it, while people who\r\ndo care for it have to pay enormous prices to get it. It seems to be\r\nthe rule of this world. Each person has what he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want, and other\r\npeople have what he does want.\r\n\r\nMarried men have wives, and don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want them; and young single\r\nfellows cry out that they can\xe2\x80\x99t get them. Poor people who can hardly\r\nkeep themselves have eight hearty children. Rich old couples, with no\r\none to leave their money to, die childless.\r\n\r\nThen there are girls with lovers. The girls that have lovers never want\r\nthem. They say they would rather be without them, that they bother\r\nthem, and why don\xe2\x80\x99t they go and make love to Miss Smith and Miss Brown,\r\nwho are plain and elderly, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t got any lovers? They themselves\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want lovers. They never mean to marry.\r\n\r\nIt does not do to dwell on these things; it makes one so sad.\r\n\r\nThere was a boy at our school, we used to call him Sandford and Merton.\r\nHis real name was Stivvings. He was the most extraordinary lad I ever\r\ncame across. I believe he really liked study. He used to get into\r\nawful rows for sitting up in bed and reading Greek; and as for French\r\nirregular verbs there was simply no keeping him away from them. He was\r\nfull of weird and unnatural notions about being a credit to his parents\r\nand an honour to the school; and he yearned to win prizes, and grow up\r\nand be a clever man, and had all those sorts of weak-minded ideas. I\r\nnever knew such a strange creature, yet harmless, mind you, as the babe\r\nunborn.\r\n\r\nWell, that boy used to get ill about twice a week, so that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo to school. There never was such a boy to get ill as that Sandford\r\nand Merton. If there was any known disease going within ten miles of\r\nhim, he had it, and had it badly. He would take bronchitis in the\r\ndog-days, and have hay-fever at Christmas. After a six weeks\xe2\x80\x99 period of\r\ndrought, he would be stricken down with rheumatic fever; and he would\r\ngo out in a November fog and come home with a sunstroke.\r\n\r\nThey put him under laughing-gas one year, poor lad, and drew all his\r\nteeth, and gave him a false set, because he suffered so terribly with\r\ntoothache; and then it turned to neuralgia and ear-ache. He was never\r\nwithout a cold, except once for nine weeks while he had scarlet fever;\r\nand he always had chilblains. During the great cholera scare of 1871,\r\nour neighbourhood was singularly free from it. There was only one\r\nreputed case in the whole parish: that case was young Stivvings.\r\n\r\nHe had to stop in bed when he was ill, and eat chicken and custards and\r\nhot-house grapes; and he would lie there and sob, because they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet him do Latin exercises, and took his German grammar away from him.\r\n\r\nAnd we other boys, who would have sacrificed ten terms of our\r\nschool-life for the sake of being ill for a day, and had no desire\r\nwhatever to give our parents any excuse for being stuck-up about us,\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t catch so much as a stiff neck. We fooled about in draughts,\r\nand it did us good, and freshened us up; and we took things to make us\r\nsick, and they made us fat, and gave us an appetite. Nothing we could\r\nthink of seemed to make us ill until the holidays began. Then, on the\r\nbreaking-up day, we caught colds, and whooping cough, and all kinds of\r\ndisorders, which lasted till the term recommenced; when, in spite of\r\neverything we could man\xc5\x93uvre to the contrary, we would get suddenly\r\nwell again, and be better than ever.\r\n\r\nSuch is life; and we are but as grass that is cut down, and put into\r\nthe oven and baked.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the carved-oak question, they must have had\r\nvery fair notions of the artistic and the beautiful, our\r\ngreat-great-grandfathers. Why, all our art treasures of to-day are only\r\nthe dug-up commonplaces of three or four hundred years ago. I wonder\r\nif there is real intrinsic beauty in the old soup-plates, beer-mugs,\r\nand candle-snuffers that we prize so now, or if it is only the halo\r\nof age glowing around them that gives them their charms in our eyes.\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cold blue\xe2\x80\x9d that we hang about our walls as ornaments were the\r\ncommon every-day household utensils of a few centuries ago; and the\r\npink shepherds and the yellow shepherdesses that we hand round now for\r\nall our friends to gush over, and pretend they understand, were the\r\nunvalued mantel-ornaments that the mother of the eighteenth century\r\nwould have given the baby to suck when he cried.\r\n\r\nWill it be the same in the future? Will the prized treasures of to-day\r\nalways be the cheap trifles of the day before? Will rows of our\r\nwillow-pattern dinner-plates be ranged above the chimneypieces of the\r\ngreat in the years 2000 and odd? Will the white cups with the gold rim\r\nand the beautiful gold flower inside (species unknown), that our Sarah\r\nJanes now break in sheer light-heartedness of spirit, be carefully\r\nmended, and stood upon a bracket, and dusted only by the lady of the\r\nhouse?\r\n\r\n[Picture: China dog] That china dog that ornaments the bedroom of my\r\nfurnished lodgings. It is a white dog. Its eyes blue. Its nose is a\r\ndelicate red, with spots. Its head is painfully erect, its expression\r\nis amiability carried to verge of imbecility. I do not admire it\r\nmyself. Considered as a work of art, I may say it irritates me.\r\nThoughtless friends jeer at it, and even my landlady herself has no\r\nadmiration for it, and excuses its presence by the circumstance that\r\nher aunt gave it to her.\r\n\r\nBut in 200 years\xe2\x80\x99 time it is more than probable that that dog will\r\nbe dug up from somewhere or other, minus its legs, and with its tail\r\nbroken, and will be sold for old china, and put in a glass cabinet.\r\nAnd people will pass it round, and admire it. They will be struck by\r\nthe wonderful depth of the colour on the nose, and speculate as to how\r\nbeautiful the bit of the tail that is lost no doubt was.\r\n\r\nWe, in this age, do not see the beauty of that dog. We are too familiar\r\nwith it. It is like the sunset and the stars: we are not awed by their\r\nloveliness because they are common to our eyes. So it is with that\r\nchina dog. In 2288 people will gush over it. The making of such dogs\r\nwill have become a lost art. Our descendants will wonder how we did\r\nit, and say how clever we were. We shall be referred to lovingly as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthose grand old artists that flourished in the nineteenth century, and\r\nproduced those china dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9csampler\xe2\x80\x9d that the eldest daughter did at school will be spoken\r\nof as \xe2\x80\x9ctapestry of the Victorian era,\xe2\x80\x9d and be almost priceless. The\r\nblue-and-white mugs of the present-day roadside inn will be hunted up,\r\nall cracked and chipped, and sold for their weight in gold, and rich\r\npeople will use them for claret cups; and travellers from Japan will\r\nbuy up all the \xe2\x80\x9cPresents from Ramsgate,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSouvenirs of Margate,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthat may have escaped destruction, and take them back to Jedo as\r\nancient English curios.\r\n\r\nAt this point Harris threw away the sculls, got up and left his seat,\r\nand sat on his back, and stuck his legs in the air. Montmorency howled,\r\nand turned a somersault, and the top hamper jumped up, and all the\r\nthings came out.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat surprised, but I did not lose my temper. I said,\r\npleasantly enough:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHulloa! what\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that for? Why\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo, on second thoughts, I will not repeat what Harris said. I may have\r\nbeen to blame, I admit it; but nothing excuses violence of language and\r\ncoarseness of expression, especially in a man who has been carefully\r\nbrought up, as I know Harris has been. I was thinking of other things,\r\nand forgot, as any one might easily understand, that I was steering,\r\nand the consequence was that we had got mixed up a good deal with the\r\ntow-path. It was difficult to say, for the moment, which was us and\r\nwhich was the Middlesex bank of the river; but we found out after a\r\nwhile, and separated ourselves.\r\n\r\nHarris, however, said he had done enough for a bit, and proposed that I\r\nshould take a turn; so, as we were in, I got out and took the tow-line,\r\nand ran the boat on past Hampton Court. What a dear old wall that is\r\nthat runs along by the river there! I never pass it without feeling\r\nbetter for the sight of it. Such a mellow, bright, sweet old wall; what\r\na charming picture it would make, with the lichen creeping here, and\r\nthe moss growing there, a shy young vine peeping over the top at this\r\nspot, to see what is going on upon the busy river, and the sober old\r\nivy clustering a little farther down! There are fifty shades and tints\r\nand hues in every ten yards of that old wall. If I could only draw,\r\nand knew how to paint, I could make a lovely sketch of that old wall,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sure. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often thought I should like to live at Hampton Court.\r\nIt looks so peaceful and so quiet, and it is such a dear old place to\r\nramble round in the early morning before many people are about.\r\n\r\nBut, there, I don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I should really care for it when it came\r\nto actual practice. It would be so ghastly dull and depressing in the\r\nevening, when your lamp cast uncanny shadows on the panelled walls, and\r\nthe echo of distant feet rang through the cold stone corridors, and now\r\ndrew nearer, and now died away, and all was death-like silence, save\r\nthe beating of one\xe2\x80\x99s own heart.\r\n\r\nWe are creatures of the sun, we men and women. We love light and life.\r\nThat is why we crowd into the towns and cities, and the country grows\r\nmore and more deserted every year. In the sunlight\xe2\x80\x94in the daytime, when\r\nNature is alive and busy all around us, we like the open hill-sides and\r\nthe deep woods well enough: but in the night, when our Mother Earth has\r\ngone to sleep, and left us waking, oh! the world seems so lonesome,\r\nand we get frightened, like children in a silent house. Then we sit\r\nand sob, and long for the gas-lit streets, and the sound of human\r\nvoices, and the answering throb of human life. We feel so helpless and\r\nso little in the great stillness, when the dark trees rustle in the\r\nnight-wind. There are so many ghosts about, and their silent sighs make\r\nus feel so sad. Let us gather together in the great cities, and light\r\nhuge bonfires of a million gas-jets, and shout and sing together, and\r\nfeel brave.\r\n\r\n[Picture: People at Hampton Maze] Harris asked me if I\xe2\x80\x99d ever been in\r\nthe maze at Hampton Court. He said he went in once to show somebody\r\nelse the way. He had studied it up in a map, and it was so simple that\r\nit seemed foolish\xe2\x80\x94hardly worth the twopence charged for admission.\r\nHarris said he thought that map must have been got up as a practical\r\njoke, because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a bit like the real thing, and only misleading.\r\nIt was a country cousin that Harris took in. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll just go in here, so that you can say you\xe2\x80\x99ve been, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very\r\nsimple. It\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to call it a maze. You keep on taking the first\r\nturning to the right. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just walk round for ten minutes, and then\r\ngo and get some lunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey met some people soon after they had got inside, who said they had\r\nbeen there for three-quarters of an hour, and had had about enough of\r\nit. Harris told them they could follow him, if they liked; he was just\r\ngoing in, and then should turn round and come out again. They said it\r\nwas very kind of him, and fell behind, and followed.\r\n\r\nThey picked up various other people who wanted to get it over, as they\r\nwent along, until they had absorbed all the persons in the maze. People\r\nwho had given up all hopes of ever getting either in or out, or of ever\r\nseeing their home and friends again, plucked up courage at the sight of\r\nHarris and his party, and joined the procession, blessing him. Harris\r\nsaid he should judge there must have been twenty people, following him,\r\nin all; and one woman with a baby, who had been there all the morning,\r\ninsisted on taking his arm, for fear of losing him.\r\n\r\nHarris kept on turning to the right, but it seemed a long way, and his\r\ncousin said he supposed it was a very big maze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, one of the largest in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it must be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the cousin, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we\xe2\x80\x99ve walked a good two\r\nmiles already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris began to think it rather strange himself, but he held on until,\r\nat last, they passed the half of a penny bun on the ground that\r\nHarris\xe2\x80\x99s cousin swore he had noticed there seven minutes ago. Harris\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d but the woman with the baby said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas she herself had taken it from the child, and thrown it down there,\r\njust before she met Harris. She also added that she wished she never\r\nhad met Harris, and expressed an opinion that he was an impostor. That\r\nmade Harris mad, and he produced his map, and explained his theory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe map may be all right enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the party, \xe2\x80\x9cif you know\r\nwhereabouts in it we are now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris didn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and suggested that the best thing to do would\r\nbe to go back to the entrance, and begin again. For the beginning\r\nagain part of it there was not much enthusiasm; but with regard to\r\nthe advisability of going back to the entrance there was complete\r\nunanimity, and so they turned, and trailed after Harris again, in the\r\nopposite direction. About ten minutes more passed, and then they found\r\nthemselves in the centre.\r\n\r\nHarris thought at first of pretending that that was what he had been\r\naiming at; but the crowd looked dangerous, and he decided to treat it\r\nas an accident.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, they had got something to start from then. They did know where\r\nthey were, and the map was once more consulted, and the thing seemed\r\nsimpler than ever, and off they started for the third time.\r\n\r\nAnd three minutes later they were back in the centre again.\r\n\r\nAfter that, they simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get anywhere else. Whatever way\r\nthey turned brought them back to the middle. It became so regular at\r\nlength, that some of the people stopped there, and waited for the\r\nothers to take a walk round, and come back to them. Harris drew out\r\nhis map again, after a while, but the sight of it only infuriated the\r\nmob, and they told him to go and curl his hair with it. Harris said\r\nthat he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling that, to a certain extent, he had become\r\nunpopular.\r\n\r\nThey all got crazy at last, and sang out for the keeper, and the man\r\ncame and climbed up the ladder outside, and shouted out directions to\r\nthem. But all their heads were, by this time, in such a confused whirl\r\nthat they were incapable of grasping anything, and so the man told\r\nthem to stop where they were, and he would come to them. They huddled\r\ntogether, and waited; and he climbed down, and came in.\r\n\r\nHe was a young keeper, as luck would have it, and new to the business;\r\nand when he got in, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find them, and he wandered about,\r\ntrying to get to them, and then _he_ got lost. They caught sight of\r\nhim, every now and then, rushing about the other side of the hedge, and\r\nhe would see them, and rush to get to them, and they would wait there\r\nfor about five minutes, and then he would reappear again in exactly the\r\nsame spot, and ask them where they had been.\r\n\r\nThey had to wait till one of the old keepers came back from his dinner\r\nbefore they got out.\r\n\r\nHarris said he thought it was a very fine maze, so far as he was a\r\njudge; and we agreed that we would try to get George to go into it, on\r\nour way back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe river in its Sunday garb.\xe2\x80\x94Dress on the river.\xe2\x80\x94A chance for the\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x94Absence of taste in Harris.\xe2\x80\x94George\xe2\x80\x99s blazer.\xe2\x80\x94A day with the\r\nfashion-plate young lady.\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s tomb.\xe2\x80\x94The man who loves not\r\ngraves and coffins and skulls.\xe2\x80\x94Harris mad.\xe2\x80\x94His views on George and\r\nBanks and lemonade.\xe2\x80\x94He performs tricks.\r\n\r\nIt was while passing through Moulsey Lock that Harris told me about his\r\nmaze experience. It took us some time to pass through, as we were the\r\nonly boat, and it is a big lock. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever remember to have\r\nseen Moulsey Lock, before, with only one boat in it. It is, I suppose,\r\nBoulter\xe2\x80\x99s not even excepted, the busiest lock on the river.\r\n\r\nI have stood and watched it, sometimes, when you could not see any\r\nwater at all, but only a brilliant tangle of bright blazers, and gay\r\ncaps, and saucy hats, and many-coloured parasols, and silken rugs, and\r\ncloaks, and streaming ribbons, and dainty whites; when looking down\r\ninto the lock from the quay, you might fancy it was a huge box into\r\nwhich flowers of every hue and shade had been thrown pell-mell, and lay\r\npiled up in a rainbow heap, that covered every corner.\r\n\r\nOn a fine Sunday it presents this appearance nearly all day long,\r\nwhile, up the stream, and down the stream, lie, waiting their turn,\r\noutside the gates, long lines of still more boats; and boats are\r\ndrawing near and passing away, so that the sunny river, from the Palace\r\nup to Hampton Church, is dotted and decked with yellow, and blue, and\r\norange, and white, and red, and pink. All the inhabitants of Hampton\r\nand Moulsey dress themselves up in boating costume, and come and mouch\r\nround the lock with their dogs, and flirt, and smoke, and watch the\r\nboats; and, altogether, what with the caps and jackets of the men, the\r\npretty coloured dresses of the women, the excited dogs, the moving\r\nboats, the white sails, the pleasant landscape, and the sparkling\r\nwater, it is one of the gayest sights I know of near this dull old\r\nLondon town.\r\n\r\nThe river affords a good opportunity for dress. For once in a way, we\r\nmen are able to show _our_ taste in colours, and I think we come out\r\nvery natty, if you ask me. I always like a little red in my things\xe2\x80\x94red\r\nand black. You know my hair is a sort of golden brown, rather a pretty\r\nshade I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told, and a dark red matches it beautifully; and then\r\nI always think a light-blue necktie goes so well with it, and a pair\r\nof those Russian-leather shoes and a red silk handkerchief round the\r\nwaist\xe2\x80\x94a handkerchief looks so much better than a belt.\r\n\r\nHarris always keeps to shades or mixtures of orange or yellow, but I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think he is at all wise in this. His complexion is too dark for\r\nyellows. Yellows don\xe2\x80\x99t suit him: there can be no question about it.\r\nI want him to take to blue as a background, with white or cream for\r\nrelief; but, there! the less taste a person has in dress, the more\r\nobstinate he always seems to be. It is a great pity, because he will\r\nnever be a success as it is, while there are one or two colours in\r\nwhich he might not really look so bad, with his hat on.\r\n\r\nGeorge has bought some new things for this trip, and I\xe2\x80\x99m rather vexed\r\nabout them. The blazer is loud. I should not like George to know that\r\nI thought so, but there really is no other word for it. He brought it\r\nhome and showed it to us on Thursday evening. We asked him what colour\r\nhe called it, and he said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t think there was a\r\nname for the colour. The man had told him it was an Oriental design.\r\nGeorge put it on, and asked us what we thought of it. Harris said that,\r\nas an object to hang over a flower-bed in early spring to frighten the\r\nbirds away, he should respect it; but that, considered as an article of\r\ndress for any human being, except a Margate nigger, it made him ill.\r\nGeorge got quite huffy; but, as Harris said, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want his\r\nopinion, why did he ask for it?\r\n\r\nWhat troubles Harris and myself, with regard to it, is that we are\r\nafraid it will attract attention to the boat.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Young lady] Girls, also, don\xe2\x80\x99t look half bad in a boat, if\r\nprettily dressed. Nothing is more fetching, to my thinking, than a\r\ntasteful boating costume. But a \xe2\x80\x9cboating costume,\xe2\x80\x9d it would be as well\r\nif all ladies would understand, ought to be a costume that can be worn\r\nin a boat, and not merely under a glass-case. It utterly spoils an\r\nexcursion if you have folk in the boat who are thinking all the time a\r\ngood deal more of their dress than of the trip. It was my misfortune\r\nonce to go for a water picnic with two ladies of this kind. We did have\r\na lively time!\r\n\r\nThey were both beautifully got up\xe2\x80\x94all lace and silky stuff, and\r\nflowers, and ribbons, and dainty shoes, and light gloves. But they were\r\ndressed for a photographic studio, not for a river picnic. They were\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cboating costumes\xe2\x80\x9d of a French fashion-plate. It was ridiculous,\r\nfooling about in them anywhere near real earth, air, and water.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was that they thought the boat was not clean. We dusted\r\nall the seats for them, and then assured them that it was, but they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t believe us. One of them rubbed the cushion with the forefinger\r\nof her glove, and showed the result to the other, and they both\r\nsighed, and sat down, with the air of early Christian martyrs trying\r\nto make themselves comfortable up against the stake. You are liable to\r\noccasionally splash a little when sculling, and it appeared that a drop\r\nof water ruined those costumes. The mark never came out, and a stain\r\nwas left on the dress for ever.\r\n\r\nI was stroke. I did my best. I feathered some two feet high, and\r\nI paused at the end of each stroke to let the blades drip before\r\nreturning them, and I picked out a smooth bit of water to drop them\r\ninto again each time. (Bow said, after a while, that he did not feel\r\nhimself a sufficiently accomplished oarsman to pull with me, but that\r\nhe would sit still, if I would allow him, and study my stroke. He said\r\nit interested him.) But, notwithstanding all this, and try as I would,\r\nI could not help an occasional flicker of water from going over those\r\ndresses.\r\n\r\nThe girls did not complain, but they huddled up close together, and\r\nset their lips firm, and every time a drop touched them, they visibly\r\nshrank and shuddered. It was a noble sight to see them suffering thus\r\nin silence, but it unnerved me altogether. I am too sensitive. I got\r\nwild and fitful in my rowing, and splashed more and more, the harder I\r\ntried not to.\r\n\r\nI gave it up at last; I said I\xe2\x80\x99d row bow. Bow thought the arrangement\r\nwould be better too, and we changed places. The ladies gave an\r\ninvoluntary sigh of relief when they saw me go, and quite brightened\r\nup for a moment. Poor girls! they had better have put up with me. The\r\nman they had got now was a jolly, light-hearted, thick-headed sort of\r\na chap, with about as much sensitiveness in him as there might be in a\r\nNewfoundland puppy. You might look daggers at him for an hour and he\r\nwould not notice it, and it would not trouble him if he did. He set a\r\ngood, rollicking, dashing stroke that sent the spray playing all over\r\nthe boat like a fountain, and made the whole crowd sit up straight\r\nin no time. When he spread more than pint of water over one of those\r\ndresses, he would give a pleasant little laugh, and say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure;\xe2\x80\x9d and offer them his handkerchief to wipe\r\nit off with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s of no consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d the poor girls would murmur in reply,\r\nand covertly draw rugs and coats over themselves, and try and protect\r\nthemselves with their lace parasols.\r\n\r\nAt lunch they had a very bad time of it. People wanted them to sit\r\non the grass, and the grass was dusty; and the tree-trunks, against\r\nwhich they were invited to lean, did not appear to have been brushed\r\nfor weeks; so they spread their handkerchiefs on the ground and sat\r\non those, bolt upright. Somebody, in walking about with a plate of\r\nbeef-steak pie, tripped up over a root, and sent the pie flying. None\r\nof it went over them, fortunately, but the accident suggested a fresh\r\ndanger to them, and agitated them; and, whenever anybody moved about,\r\nafter that, with anything in his hand that could fall and make a mess,\r\nthey watched that person with growing anxiety until he sat down again.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: Washing up]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow then, you girls,\xe2\x80\x9d said our friend Bow to them, cheerily, after it\r\nwas all over, \xe2\x80\x9ccome along, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wash up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand him at first. When they grasped the idea, they\r\nsaid they feared they did not know how to wash up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon show you,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s rare fun! You lie down on\r\nyour\xe2\x80\x94I mean you lean over the bank, you know, and sloush the things\r\nabout in the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe elder sister said that she was afraid that they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got on\r\ndresses suited to the work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he light-heartedly; \xe2\x80\x9ctuck \xe2\x80\x99em up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he made them do it, too. He told them that that sort of thing was\r\nhalf the fun of a picnic. They said it was very interesting.\r\n\r\nNow I come to think it over, was that young man as dense-headed as we\r\nthought? or was he\xe2\x80\x94no, impossible! there was such a simple, child-like\r\nexpression about him!\r\n\r\nHarris wanted to get out at Hampton Church, to go and see Mrs. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is Mrs. Thomas?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harris. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a lady that\xe2\x80\x99s got a funny\r\ntomb, and I want to see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI objected. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it is that I am built wrong, but I\r\nnever did seem to hanker after tombstones myself. I know that the\r\nproper thing to do, when you get to a village or town, is to rush off\r\nto the churchyard, and enjoy the graves; but it is a recreation that I\r\nalways deny myself. I take no interest in creeping round dim and chilly\r\nchurches behind wheezy old men, and reading epitaphs. Not even the\r\nsight of a bit of cracked brass let into a stone affords me what I call\r\nreal happiness.\r\n\r\nI shock respectable sextons by the imperturbability I am able to assume\r\nbefore exciting inscriptions, and by my lack of enthusiasm for the\r\nlocal family history, while my ill-concealed anxiety to get outside\r\nwounds their feelings.\r\n\r\nOne golden morning of a sunny day, I leant against the low stone wall\r\nthat guarded a little village church, and I smoked, and drank in deep,\r\ncalm gladness from the sweet, restful scene\xe2\x80\x94the grey old church with\r\nits clustering ivy and its quaint carved wooden porch, the white lane\r\nwinding down the hill between tall rows of elms, the thatched-roof\r\ncottages peeping above their trim-kept hedges, the silver river in the\r\nhollow, the wooded hills beyond!\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely landscape. It was idyllic, poetical, and it inspired\r\nme. I felt good and noble. I felt I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be sinful and wicked\r\nany more. I would come and live here, and never do any more wrong, and\r\nlead a blameless, beautiful life, and have silver hair when I got old,\r\nand all that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nIn that moment I forgave all my friends and relations for their\r\nwickedness and cussedness, and I blessed them. They did not know that\r\nI blessed them. They went their abandoned way all unconscious of what\r\nI, far away in that peaceful village, was doing for them; but I did it,\r\nand I wished that I could let them know that I had done it, because\r\nI wanted to make them happy. I was going on thinking away all these\r\ngrand, tender thoughts, when my reverie was broken in upon by a shrill\r\npiping voice crying out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, sur, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-coming, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-coming. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right, sur; don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou be in a hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked up, and saw an old bald-headed man hobbling across the\r\nchurchyard towards me, carrying a huge bunch of keys in his hand that\r\nshook and jingled at every step.\r\n\r\nI motioned him away with silent dignity, but he still advanced,\r\nscreeching out the while:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a-coming, sur, I\xe2\x80\x99m a-coming. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little lame. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t as spry as\r\nI used to be. This way, sur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away, you miserable old man,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve come as soon as I could, sur,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cMy missis never see\r\nyou till just this minute. You follow me, sur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo away,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated; \xe2\x80\x9cleave me before I get over the wall, and slay\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to see the tombs?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. I want to stop here, leaning up against\r\nthis gritty old wall. Go away, and don\xe2\x80\x99t disturb me. I am chock full\r\nof beautiful and noble thoughts, and I want to stop like it, because\r\nit feels nice and good. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you come fooling about, making me mad,\r\nchivying away all my better feelings with this silly tombstone nonsense\r\nof yours. Go away, and get somebody to bury you cheap, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay\r\nhalf the expense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was bewildered for a moment. He rubbed his eyes, and looked hard at\r\nme. I seemed human enough on the outside: he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it out.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYuise a stranger in these parts? You don\xe2\x80\x99t live here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Picture: Graves] \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. _You_ wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if _I_ did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou want to see the tombs\xe2\x80\x94graves\xe2\x80\x94folks been\r\nburied, you know\xe2\x80\x94coffins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are an untruther,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, getting roused; \xe2\x80\x9cI do not want to\r\nsee tombs\xe2\x80\x94not your tombs. Why should I? We have graves of our own, our\r\nfamily has. Why my uncle Podger has a tomb in Kensal Green Cemetery,\r\nthat is the pride of all that country-side; and my grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s vault\r\nat Bow is capable of accommodating eight visitors, while my great-aunt\r\nSusan has a brick grave in Finchley Churchyard, with a headstone with\r\na coffee-pot sort of thing in bas-relief upon it, and a six-inch best\r\nwhite stone coping all the way round, that cost pounds. When I want\r\ngraves, it is to those places that I go and revel. I do not want other\r\nfolk\xe2\x80\x99s. When you yourself are buried, I will come and see yours. That\r\nis all I can do for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe burst into tears. He said that one of the tombs had a bit of stone\r\nupon the top of it that had been said by some to be probably part of\r\nthe remains of the figure of a man, and that another had some words,\r\ncarved upon it, that nobody had ever been able to decipher.\r\n\r\nI still remained obdurate, and, in broken-hearted tones, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, won\xe2\x80\x99t you come and see the memorial window?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI would not even see that, so he fired his last shot. He drew near, and\r\nwhispered hoarsely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of skulls down in the crypt,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9ccome and see\r\nthose. Oh, do come and see the skulls! You are a young man out for a\r\nholiday, and you want to enjoy yourself. Come and see the skulls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I turned and fled, and as I sped I heard him calling to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come and see the skulls; come back and see the skulls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris, however, revels in tombs, and graves, and epitaphs, and\r\nmonumental inscriptions, and the thought of not seeing Mrs. Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrave made him crazy. He said he had looked forward to seeing Mrs.\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s grave from the first moment that the trip was proposed\xe2\x80\x94said\r\nhe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have joined if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for the idea of seeing Mrs.\r\nThomas\xe2\x80\x99s tomb.\r\n\r\nI reminded him of George, and how we had to get the boat up to\r\nShepperton by five o\xe2\x80\x99clock to meet him, and then he went for George.\r\nWhy was George to fool about all day, and leave us to lug this\r\nlumbering old top-heavy barge up and down the river by ourselves to\r\nmeet him? Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t George come and do some work? Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he\r\nhave got the day off, and come down with us? Bank be blowed! What good\r\nwas he at the bank?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never see him doing any work there,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever I\r\ngo in. He sits behind a bit of glass all day, trying to look as if he\r\nwas doing something. What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of a man behind a bit of glass? I\r\nhave to work for my living. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t he work? What use is he there,\r\nand what\xe2\x80\x99s the good of their banks? They take your money, and then,\r\nwhen you draw a cheque, they send it back smeared all over with \xe2\x80\x98No\r\neffects,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Refer to drawer.\xe2\x80\x99 What\xe2\x80\x99s the good of that? That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort\r\nof trick they served me twice last week. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stand it much\r\nlonger. I shall withdraw my account. If he was here, we could go and\r\nsee that tomb. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe he\xe2\x80\x99s at the bank at all. He\xe2\x80\x99s larking\r\nabout somewhere, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, leaving us to do all the work.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get out, and have a drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pointed out to him that we were miles away from a pub.; and then he\r\nwent on about the river, and what was the good of the river, and was\r\neveryone who came on the river to die of thirst?\r\n\r\nIt is always best to let Harris have his head when he gets like this.\r\nThen he pumps himself out, and is quiet afterwards.\r\n\r\nI reminded him that there was concentrated lemonade in the hamper, and\r\na gallon-jar of water in the nose of the boat, and that the two only\r\nwanted mixing to make a cool and refreshing beverage.\r\n\r\nThen he flew off about lemonade, and \xe2\x80\x9csuch-like Sunday-school slops,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas he termed them, ginger-beer, raspberry syrup, &c., &c. He said they\r\nall produced dyspepsia, and ruined body and soul alike, and were the\r\ncause of half the crime in England.\r\n\r\nHe said he must drink something, however, and climbed upon the seat,\r\nand leant over to get the bottle. It was right at the bottom of\r\nthe hamper, and seemed difficult to find, and he had to lean over\r\nfurther and further, and, in trying to steer at the same time, from a\r\ntopsy-turvy point of view, he pulled the wrong line, and sent the boat\r\ninto the bank, and the shock upset him, and he dived down right into\r\nthe hamper, and stood there on his head, holding on to the sides of the\r\nboat like grim death, his legs sticking up into the air. He dared not\r\nmove for fear of going over, and had to stay there till I could get\r\nhold of his legs, and haul him back, and that made him madder than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackmailing.\xe2\x80\x94The proper course to pursue.\xe2\x80\x94Selfish boorishness of\r\nriver-side landowner.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNotice\xe2\x80\x9d boards.\xe2\x80\x94Unchristianlike feelings of\r\nHarris.\xe2\x80\x94How Harris sings a comic song.\xe2\x80\x94A high-class party.\xe2\x80\x94Shameful\r\nconduct of two abandoned young men.\xe2\x80\x94Some useless information.\xe2\x80\x94George\r\nbuys a banjo.\r\n\r\nWe stopped under the willows by Kempton Park, and lunched. It is a\r\npretty little spot there: a pleasant grass plateau, running along\r\nby the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, and overhung by willows. We had just commenced\r\nthe third course\xe2\x80\x94the bread and jam\xe2\x80\x94when a gentleman in shirt-sleeves\r\nand a short pipe came along, and wanted to know if we knew that we\r\nwere trespassing. We said we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given the matter sufficient\r\nconsideration as yet to enable us to arrive at a definite conclusion on\r\nthat point, but that, if he assured us on his word as a gentleman that\r\nwe _were_ trespassing, we would, without further hesitation, believe it.\r\n\r\nHe gave us the required assurance, and we thanked him, but he still\r\nhung about, and seemed to be dissatisfied, so we asked him if there\r\nwas anything further that we could do for him; and Harris, who is of a\r\nchummy disposition, offered him a bit of bread and jam.\r\n\r\nI fancy he must have belonged to some society sworn to abstain from\r\nbread and jam; for he declined it quite gruffly, as if he were vexed at\r\nbeing tempted with it, and he added that it was his duty to turn us off.\r\n\r\nHarris said that if it was a duty it ought to be done, and asked the\r\nman what was his idea with regard to the best means for accomplishing\r\nit. Harris is what you would call a well-made man of about number one\r\nsize, and looks hard and bony, and the man measured him up and down,\r\nand said he would go and consult his master, and then come back and\r\nchuck us both into the river.\r\n\r\nOf course, we never saw him any more, and, of course, all he really\r\nwanted was a shilling. There are a certain number of riverside roughs\r\nwho make quite an income, during the summer, by slouching about the\r\nbanks and blackmailing weak-minded noodles in this way. They represent\r\nthemselves as sent by the proprietor. The proper course to pursue is\r\nto offer your name and address, and leave the owner, if he really has\r\nanything to do with the matter, to summon you, and prove what damage\r\nyou have done to his land by sitting down on a bit of it. But the\r\nmajority of people are so intensely lazy and timid, that they prefer to\r\nencourage the imposition by giving in to it rather than put an end to\r\nit by the exertion of a little firmness.\r\n\r\nWhere it is really the owners that are to blame, they ought to be\r\nshown up. The selfishness of the riparian proprietor grows with every\r\nyear. If these men had their way they would close the river Thames\r\naltogether. They actually do this along the minor tributary streams and\r\nin the backwaters. They drive posts into the bed of the stream, and\r\ndraw chains across from bank to bank, and nail huge notice-boards on\r\nevery tree. The sight of those notice-boards rouses every evil instinct\r\nin my nature. I feel I want to tear each one down, and hammer it over\r\nthe head of the man who put it up, until I have killed him, and then I\r\nwould bury him, and put the board up over the grave as a tombstone.\r\n\r\nI mentioned these feelings of mine to Harris, and he said he had them\r\nworse than that. He said he not only felt he wanted to kill the man who\r\ncaused the board to be put up, but that he should like to slaughter the\r\nwhole of his family and all his friends and relations, and then burn\r\ndown his house. This seemed to me to be going too far, and I said so to\r\nHarris; but he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it. Serve \xe2\x80\x99em all jolly well right, and I\xe2\x80\x99d go and sing\r\ncomic songs on the ruins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was vexed to hear Harris go on in this blood-thirsty strain. We\r\nnever ought to allow our instincts of justice to degenerate into mere\r\nvindictiveness. It was a long while before I could get Harris to take\r\na more Christian view of the subject, but I succeeded at last, and\r\nhe promised me that he would spare the friends and relations at all\r\nevents, and would not sing comic songs on the ruins.\r\n\r\nYou have never heard Harris sing a comic song, or you would understand\r\nthe service I had rendered to mankind. It is one of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s fixed\r\nideas that he _can_ sing a comic song; the fixed idea, on the contrary,\r\namong those of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s friends who have heard him try, is that he\r\n_can\xe2\x80\x99t_ and never will be able to, and that he ought not to be allowed\r\nto try.\r\n\r\nWhen Harris is at a party, and is asked to sing, he replies: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\r\ncan only sing a _comic_ song, you know;\xe2\x80\x9d and he says it in a tone that\r\nimplies that his singing of _that_, however, is a thing that you ought\r\nto hear once, and then die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that _is_ nice,\xe2\x80\x9d says the hostess. \xe2\x80\x9cDo sing one, Mr. Harris;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nHarris gets up, and makes for the piano, with the beaming cheeriness of\r\na generous-minded man who is just about to give somebody something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, silence, please, everybody\xe2\x80\x9d says the hostess, turning round; \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nHarris is going to sing a comic song!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how jolly!\xe2\x80\x9d they murmur; and they hurry in from the conservatory,\r\nand come up from the stairs, and go and fetch each other from all over\r\nthe house, and crowd into the drawing-room, and sit round, all smirking\r\nin anticipation.\r\n\r\nThen Harris begins.\r\n\r\nWell, you don\xe2\x80\x99t look for much of a voice in a comic song. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect correct phrasing or vocalization. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if a man does\r\nfind out, when in the middle of a note, that he is too high, and comes\r\ndown with a jerk. You don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about time. You don\xe2\x80\x99t mind a man\r\nbeing two bars in front of the accompaniment, and easing up in the\r\nmiddle of a line to argue it out with the pianist, and then starting\r\nthe verse afresh. But you do expect the words.\r\n\r\nYou don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a man to never remember more than the first three\r\nlines of the first verse, and to keep on repeating these until it is\r\ntime to begin the chorus. You don\xe2\x80\x99t expect a man to break off in the\r\nmiddle of a line, and snigger, and say, it\xe2\x80\x99s very funny, but he\xe2\x80\x99s blest\r\nif he can think of the rest of it, and then try and make it up for\r\nhimself, and, afterwards, suddenly recollect it, when he has got to an\r\nentirely different part of the song, and break off, without a word of\r\nwarning, to go back and let you have it then and there. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nI will just give you an idea of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s comic singing, and then you\r\ncan judge of it for yourself.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Harris] HARRIS (_standing up in front of piano and addressing\r\nthe expectant mob_): \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid it\xe2\x80\x99s a very old thing, you know.

He honestly\r\nimagines that he has given them a treat, and says he will sing another\r\ncomic song after supper.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of comic songs and parties, reminds me of a rather curious\r\nincident at which I once assisted; which, as it throws much light upon\r\nthe inner mental working of human nature in general, ought, I think, to\r\nbe recorded in these pages.\r\n\r\nWe were a fashionable and highly cultured party. We had on our best\r\nclothes, and we talked pretty, and were very happy\xe2\x80\x94all except two young\r\nfellows, students, just returned from Germany, commonplace young men,\r\nwho seemed restless and uncomfortable, as if they found the proceedings\r\nslow. The truth was, we were too clever for them. Our brilliant but\r\npolished conversation, and our high-class tastes, were beyond them.\r\nThey were out of place, among us. They never ought to have been there\r\nat all. Everybody agreed upon that, later on.\r\n\r\nWe played _morceaux_ from the old German masters. We discussed\r\nphilosophy and ethics. We flirted with graceful dignity. We were even\r\nhumorous\xe2\x80\x94in a high-class way.\r\n\r\nSomebody recited a French poem after supper, and we said it was\r\nbeautiful; and then a lady sang a sentimental ballad in Spanish, and it\r\nmade one or two of us weep\xe2\x80\x94it was so pathetic.\r\n\r\nAnd then those two young men got up, and asked us if we had ever heard\r\nHerr Slossenn Boschen (who had just arrived, and was then down in the\r\nsupper-room) sing his great German comic song.\r\n\r\nNone of us had heard it, that we could remember.\r\n\r\nThe young men said it was the funniest song that had ever been written,\r\nand that, if we liked, they would get Herr Slossenn Boschen, whom they\r\nknew very well, to sing it. They said it was so funny that, when Herr\r\nSlossenn Boschen had sung it once before the German Emperor, he (the\r\nGerman Emperor) had had to be carried off to bed.\r\n\r\nThey said nobody could sing it like Herr Slossenn Boschen; he was so\r\nintensely serious all through it that you might fancy he was reciting\r\na tragedy, and that, of course, made it all the funnier. They said he\r\nnever once suggested by his tone or manner that he was singing anything\r\nfunny\xe2\x80\x94that would spoil it. It was his air of seriousness, almost of\r\npathos, that made it so irresistibly amusing.\r\n\r\nWe said we yearned to hear it, that we wanted a good laugh; and they\r\nwent downstairs, and fetched Herr Slossenn Boschen.\r\n\r\nHe appeared to be quite pleased to sing it, for he came up at once, and\r\nsat down to the piano without another word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it will amuse you. You will laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered the two young men,\r\nas they passed through the room, and took up an unobtrusive position\r\nbehind the Professor\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\nHerr Slossenn Boschen accompanied himself. The prelude did not suggest\r\na comic song exactly. It was a weird, soulful air. It quite made one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflesh creep; but we murmured to one another that it was the German\r\nmethod, and prepared to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand German myself. I learned it at school, but forgot\r\nevery word of it two years after I had left, and have felt much\r\nbetter ever since. Still, I did not want the people there to guess my\r\nignorance; so I hit upon what I thought to be rather a good idea. I\r\nkept my eye on the two young students, and followed them. When they\r\ntittered, I tittered; when they roared, I roared; and I also threw in\r\na little snigger all by myself now and then, as if I had seen a bit\r\nof humour that had escaped the others. I considered this particularly\r\nartful on my part.\r\n\r\nI noticed, as the song progressed, that a good many other people seemed\r\nto have their eye fixed on the two young men, as well as myself. These\r\nother people also tittered when the young men tittered, and roared when\r\nthe young men roared; and, as the two young men tittered and roared and\r\nexploded with laughter pretty continuously all through the song, it\r\nwent exceedingly well.\r\n\r\nAnd yet that German Professor did not seem happy. At first, when we\r\nbegan to laugh, the expression of his face was one of intense surprise,\r\nas if laughter were the very last thing he had expected to be greeted\r\nwith. We thought this very funny: we said his earnest manner was half\r\nthe humour. The slightest hint on his part that he knew how funny he\r\nwas would have completely ruined it all. As we continued to laugh,\r\nhis surprise gave way to an air of annoyance and indignation, and he\r\nscowled fiercely round upon us all (except upon the two young men who,\r\nbeing behind him, he could not see). That sent us into convulsions. We\r\ntold each other that it would be the death of us, this thing. The words\r\nalone, we said, were enough to send us into fits, but added to his mock\r\nseriousness\xe2\x80\x94oh, it was too much!\r\n\r\nIn the last verse, he surpassed himself. He glowered round upon us with\r\na look of such concentrated ferocity that, but for our being forewarned\r\nas to the German method of comic singing, we should have been nervous;\r\nand he threw such a wailing note of agony into the weird music that, if\r\nwe had not known it was a funny song, we might have wept.\r\n\r\nHe finished amid a perfect shriek of laughter. We said it was the\r\nfunniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives. We said how strange\r\nit was that, in the face of things like these, there should be a\r\npopular notion that the Germans hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any sense of humour. And we\r\nasked the Professor why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t translate the song into English, so\r\nthat the common people could understand it, and hear what a real comic\r\nsong was like.\r\n\r\nThen Herr Slossenn Boschen got up, and went on awful. He swore at us in\r\nGerman (which I should judge to be a singularly effective language for\r\nthat purpose), and he danced, and shook his fists, and called us all\r\nthe English he knew. He said he had never been so insulted in all his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the song was not a comic song at all. It was about\r\na young girl who lived in the Hartz Mountains, and who had given up\r\nher life to save her lover\xe2\x80\x99s soul; and he died, and met her spirit in\r\nthe air; and then, in the last verse, he jilted her spirit, and went\r\non with another spirit\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure of the details, but it was\r\nsomething very sad, I know. Herr Boschen said he had sung it once\r\nbefore the German Emperor, and he (the German Emperor) had sobbed like\r\na little child. He (Herr Boschen) said it was generally acknowledged to\r\nbe one of the most tragic and pathetic songs in the German language.\r\n\r\nIt was a trying situation for us\xe2\x80\x94very trying. There seemed to be no\r\nanswer. We looked around for the two young men who had done this thing,\r\nbut they had left the house in an unostentatious manner immediately\r\nafter the end of the song.\r\n\r\nThat was the end of that party. I never saw a party break up so\r\nquietly, and with so little fuss. We never said good-night even to\r\none another. We came downstairs one at a time, walking softly, and\r\nkeeping the shady side. We asked the servant for our hats and coats in\r\nwhispers, and opened the door for ourselves, and slipped out, and got\r\nround the corner quickly, avoiding each other as much as possible.\r\n\r\nI have never taken much interest in German songs since then.\r\n\r\nWe reached Sunbury Lock at half-past three. The river is sweetly pretty\r\njust there before you come to the gates, and the backwater is charming;\r\nbut don\xe2\x80\x99t attempt to row up it.\r\n\r\nI tried to do so once. I was sculling, and asked the fellows who were\r\nsteering if they thought it could be done, and they said, oh, yes, they\r\nthought so, if I pulled hard. We were just under the little foot-bridge\r\nthat crosses it between the two weirs, when they said this, and I bent\r\ndown over the sculls, and set myself up, and pulled.\r\n\r\nI pulled splendidly. I got well into a steady rhythmical swing. I put\r\nmy arms, and my legs, and my back into it. I set myself a good, quick,\r\ndashing stroke, and worked in really grand style. My two friends said\r\nit was a pleasure to watch me. At the end of five minutes, I thought we\r\nought to be pretty near the weir, and I looked up. We were under the\r\nbridge, in exactly the same spot that we were when I began, and there\r\nwere those two idiots, injuring themselves by violent laughing. I had\r\nbeen grinding away like mad to keep that boat stuck still under that\r\nbridge. I let other people pull up backwaters against strong streams\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nWe sculled up to Walton, a rather large place for a riverside town. As\r\nwith all riverside places, only the tiniest corner of it comes down to\r\nthe water, so that from the boat you might fancy it was a village of\r\nsome half-dozen houses, all told. Windsor and Abingdon are the only\r\ntowns between London and Oxford that you can really see anything of\r\nfrom the stream. All the others hide round corners, and merely peep at\r\nthe river down one street: my thanks to them for being so considerate,\r\nand leaving the river-banks to woods and fields and water-works.\r\n\r\nEven Reading, though it does its best to spoil and sully and make\r\nhideous as much of the river as it can reach, is good-natured enough to\r\nkeep its ugly face a good deal out of sight.\r\n\r\nC\xc3\xa6sar, of course, had a little place at Walton\xe2\x80\x94a camp, or an\r\nentrenchment, or something of that sort. C\xc3\xa6sar was a regular up-river\r\nman. Also Queen Elizabeth, she was there, too. You can never get away\r\nfrom that woman, go where you will. Cromwell and Bradshaw (not the\r\nguide man, but the King Charles\xe2\x80\x99s head man) likewise sojourned here.\r\nThey must have been quite a pleasant little party, altogether.\r\n\r\nThere is an iron \xe2\x80\x9cscold\xe2\x80\x99s bridle\xe2\x80\x9d in Walton Church. They used these\r\nthings in ancient days for curbing women\xe2\x80\x99s tongues. They have given up\r\nthe attempt now. I suppose iron was getting scarce, and nothing else\r\nwould be strong enough.\r\n\r\nThere are also tombs of note in the church, and I was afraid I should\r\nnever get Harris past them; but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to think of them, and we\r\nwent on. Above the bridge the river winds tremendously. This makes it\r\nlook picturesque; but it irritates you from a towing or sculling point\r\nof view, and causes argument between the man who is pulling and the man\r\nwho is steering.\r\n\r\nYou pass Oatlands Park on the right bank here. It is a famous old\r\nplace. Henry VIII. stole it from some one or the other, I forget whom\r\nnow, and lived in it. There is a grotto in the park which you can see\r\nfor a fee, and which is supposed to be very wonderful; but I cannot see\r\nmuch in it myself. The late Duchess of York, who lived at Oatlands,\r\nwas very fond of dogs, and kept an immense number. She had a special\r\ngraveyard made, in which to bury them when they died, and there they\r\nlie, about fifty of them, with a tombstone over each, and an epitaph\r\ninscribed thereon.\r\n\r\nWell, I dare say they deserve it quite as much as the average Christian\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nAt \xe2\x80\x9cCorway Stakes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the first bend above Walton Bridge\xe2\x80\x94was fought a\r\nbattle between C\xc3\xa6sar and Cassivelaunus. Cassivelaunus had prepared the\r\nriver for C\xc3\xa6sar, by planting it full of stakes (and had, no doubt, put\r\nup a notice-board). But C\xc3\xa6sar crossed in spite of this. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nchoke C\xc3\xa6sar off that river. He is the sort of man we want round the\r\nbackwaters now.\r\n\r\nHalliford and Shepperton are both pretty little spots where they touch\r\nthe river; but there is nothing remarkable about either of them. There\r\nis a tomb in Shepperton churchyard, however, with a poem on it, and\r\nI was nervous lest Harris should want to get out and fool round it.\r\nI saw him fix a longing eye on the landing-stage as we drew near it,\r\nso I managed, by an adroit movement, to jerk his cap into the water,\r\nand in the excitement of recovering that, and his indignation at my\r\nclumsiness, he forgot all about his beloved graves.\r\n\r\nAt Weybridge, the Wey (a pretty little stream, navigable for small\r\nboats up to Guildford, and one which I have always been making up my\r\nmind to explore, and never have), the Bourne, and the Basingstoke Canal\r\nall enter the Thames together. The lock is just opposite the town, and\r\nthe first thing that we saw, when we came in view of it, was George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblazer on one of the lock gates, closer inspection showing that George\r\nwas inside it.\r\n\r\nMontmorency set up a furious barking, I shrieked, Harris roared; George\r\nwaved his hat, and yelled back. The lock-keeper rushed out with a\r\ndrag, under the impression that somebody had fallen into the lock, and\r\nappeared annoyed at finding that no one had.\r\n\r\nGeorge had rather a curious oilskin-covered parcel in his hand. It was\r\nround and flat at one end, with a long straight handle sticking out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca frying-pan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, with a strange, wild look glittering in his eyes;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey are all the rage this season; everybody has got them up the\r\nriver. It\xe2\x80\x99s a banjo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew you played the banjo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harris and I, in one breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied George: \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s very easy, they tell me; and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the instruction book!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: George and the banjo]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge is introduced to work.\xe2\x80\x94Heathenish instincts of\r\ntow-lines.\xe2\x80\x94Ungrateful conduct of a double-sculling skiff.\xe2\x80\x94Towers\r\nand towed.\xe2\x80\x94A use discovered for lovers.\xe2\x80\x94Strange disappearance of an\r\nelderly lady.\xe2\x80\x94Much haste, less speed.\xe2\x80\x94Being towed by girls: exciting\r\nsensation.\xe2\x80\x94The missing lock or the haunted river.\xe2\x80\x94Music.\xe2\x80\x94Saved!\r\n\r\nWe made George work, now we had got him. He did not want to work, of\r\ncourse; that goes without saying. He had had a hard time in the City,\r\nso he explained. Harris, who is callous in his nature, and not prone to\r\npity, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! and now you are going to have a hard time on the river for a\r\nchange; change is good for everyone. Out you get!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe could not in conscience\xe2\x80\x94not even George\xe2\x80\x99s conscience\xe2\x80\x94object, though\r\nhe did suggest that, perhaps, it would be better for him to stop in the\r\nboat, and get tea ready, while Harris and I towed, because getting tea\r\nwas such a worrying work, and Harris and I looked tired. The only reply\r\nwe made to this, however, was to pass him over the tow-line, and he\r\ntook it, and stepped out.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Dog wrapped in tow-line] There is something very strange and\r\nunaccountable about a tow-line. You roll it up with as much patience\r\nand care as you would take to fold up a new pair of trousers, and\r\nfive minutes afterwards, when you pick it up, it is one ghastly,\r\nsoul-revolting tangle.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to be insulting, but I firmly believe that if you took\r\nan average tow-line, and stretched it out straight across the middle\r\nof a field, and then turned your back on it for thirty seconds, that,\r\nwhen you looked round again, you would find that it had got itself\r\naltogether in a heap in the middle of the field, and had twisted itself\r\nup, and tied itself into knots, and lost its two ends, and become all\r\nloops; and it would take you a good half-hour, sitting down there on\r\nthe grass and swearing all the while, to disentangle it again.\r\n\r\nThat is my opinion of tow-lines in general. Of course, there may be\r\nhonourable exceptions; I do not say that there are not. There may\r\nbe tow-lines that are a credit to their profession\xe2\x80\x94conscientious,\r\nrespectable tow-lines\xe2\x80\x94tow-lines that do not imagine they are\r\ncrochet-work, and try to knit themselves up into antimacassars the\r\ninstant they are left to themselves. I say there _may_ be such\r\ntow-lines; I sincerely hope there are. But I have not met with them.\r\n\r\nThis tow-line I had taken in myself just before we had got to the lock.\r\nI would not let Harris touch it, because he is careless. I had looped\r\nit round slowly and cautiously, and tied it up in the middle, and\r\nfolded it in two, and laid it down gently at the bottom of the boat.\r\nHarris had lifted it up scientifically, and had put it into George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand. George had taken it firmly, and held it away from him, and had\r\nbegun to unravel it as if he were taking the swaddling clothes off a\r\nnew-born infant; and, before he had unwound a dozen yards, the thing\r\nwas more like a badly-made door-mat than anything else.\r\n\r\nIt is always the same, and the same sort of thing always goes on in\r\nconnection with it. The man on the bank, who is trying to disentangle\r\nit, thinks all the fault lies with the man who rolled it up; and when a\r\nman up the river thinks a thing, he says it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been trying to do with it, make a fishing-net of it?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ve made a nice mess you have; why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you wind it up properly,\r\nyou silly dummy?\xe2\x80\x9d he grunts from time to time as he struggles wildly\r\nwith it, and lays it out flat on the tow-path, and runs round and round\r\nit, trying to find the end.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the man who wound it up thinks the whole cause of\r\nthe muddle rests with the man who is trying to unwind it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all right when you took it!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaims indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think what you are doing? You go about things in such a\r\nslap-dash style. You\xe2\x80\x99d get a scaffolding pole entangled _you_ would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they feel so angry with one another that they would like to hang\r\neach other with the thing. Ten minutes go by, and the first man gives\r\na yell and goes mad, and dances on the rope, and tries to pull it\r\nstraight by seizing hold of the first piece that comes to his hand and\r\nhauling at it. Of course, this only gets it into a tighter tangle than\r\never. Then the second man climbs out of the boat and comes to help him,\r\nand they get in each other\xe2\x80\x99s way, and hinder one another. They both get\r\nhold of the same bit of line, and pull at it in opposite directions,\r\nand wonder where it is caught. In the end, they do get it clear, and\r\nthen turn round and find that the boat has drifted off, and is making\r\nstraight for the weir.\r\n\r\nThis really happened once to my own knowledge. It was up by Boveney,\r\none rather windy morning. We were pulling down stream, and, as we came\r\nround the bend, we noticed a couple of men on the bank. They were\r\nlooking at each other with as bewildered and helplessly miserable\r\nexpression as I have ever witnessed on any human countenance before or\r\nsince, and they held a long tow-line between them. It was clear that\r\nsomething had happened, so we eased up and asked them what was the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, our boat\xe2\x80\x99s gone off!\xe2\x80\x9d they replied in an indignant tone. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just\r\ngot out to disentangle the tow-line, and when we looked round, it was\r\ngone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they seemed hurt at what they evidently regarded as a mean and\r\nungrateful act on the part of the boat.\r\n\r\nWe found the truant for them half a mile further down, held by some\r\nrushes, and we brought it back to them. I bet they did not give that\r\nboat another chance for a week.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the picture of those two men walking up and down\r\nthe bank with a tow-line, looking for their boat.\r\n\r\nOne sees a good many funny incidents up the river in connection with\r\ntowing. One of the most common is the sight of a couple of towers,\r\nwalking briskly along, deep in an animated discussion, while the man\r\nin the boat, a hundred yards behind them, is vainly shrieking to them\r\nto stop, and making frantic signs of distress with a scull. Something\r\nhas gone wrong; the rudder has come off, or the boat-hook has slipped\r\noverboard, or his hat has dropped into the water and is floating\r\nrapidly down stream.\r\n\r\nHe calls to them to stop, quite gently and politely at first.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Hat in the water] \xe2\x80\x9cHi! stop a minute, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d he shouts\r\ncheerily. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped my hat over-board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen: \xe2\x80\x9cHi! Tom\xe2\x80\x94Dick! can\xe2\x80\x99t you hear?\xe2\x80\x9d not quite so affably this time.\r\n\r\nThen: \xe2\x80\x9cHi! Confound _you_, you dunder-headed idiots! Hi! stop! Oh you\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that he springs up, and dances about, and roars himself red in\r\nthe face, and curses everything he knows. And the small boys on the\r\nbank stop and jeer at him, and pitch stones at him as he is pulled\r\nalong past them, at the rate of four miles an hour, and can\xe2\x80\x99t get out.\r\n\r\nMuch of this sort of trouble would be saved if those who are towing\r\nwould keep remembering that they are towing, and give a pretty frequent\r\nlook round to see how their man is getting on. It is best to let one\r\nperson tow. When two are doing it, they get chattering, and forget, and\r\nthe boat itself, offering, as it does, but little resistance, is of no\r\nreal service in reminding them of the fact.\r\n\r\nAs an example of how utterly oblivious a pair of towers can be to their\r\nwork, George told us, later on in the evening, when we were discussing\r\nthe subject after supper, of a very curious instance.\r\n\r\n                [Picture: Two people towing, boat adrift]\r\n\r\nHe and three other men, so he said, were sculling a very heavily laden\r\nboat up from Maidenhead one evening, and a little above Cookham lock\r\nthey noticed a fellow and a girl, walking along the towpath, both deep\r\nin an apparently interesting and absorbing conversation. They were\r\ncarrying a boat-hook between them, and, attached to the boat-hook was\r\na tow-line, which trailed behind them, its end in the water. No boat\r\nwas near, no boat was in sight. There must have been a boat attached\r\nto that tow-line at some time or other, that was certain; but what had\r\nbecome of it, what ghastly fate had overtaken it, and those who had\r\nbeen left in it, was buried in mystery. Whatever the accident may have\r\nbeen, however, it had in no way disturbed the young lady and gentleman,\r\nwho were towing. They had the boat-hook and they had the line, and that\r\nseemed to be all that they thought necessary to their work.\r\n\r\nGeorge was about to call out and wake them up, but, at that moment,\r\na bright idea flashed across him, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He got the hitcher\r\ninstead, and reached over, and drew in the end of the tow-line; and\r\nthey made a loop in it, and put it over their mast, and then they\r\ntidied up the sculls, and went and sat down in the stern, and lit their\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nAnd that young man and young woman towed those four hulking chaps and a\r\nheavy boat up to Marlow.\r\n\r\nGeorge said he never saw so much thoughtful sadness concentrated into\r\none glance before, as when, at the lock, that young couple grasped the\r\nidea that, for the last two miles, they had been towing the wrong boat.\r\nGeorge fancied that, if it had not been for the restraining influence\r\nof the sweet woman at his side, the young man might have given way to\r\nviolent language.\r\n\r\nThe maiden was the first to recover from her surprise, and, when she\r\ndid, she clasped her hands, and said, wildly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Henry, then _where_ is auntie?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they ever recover the old lady?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harris.\r\n\r\nGeorge replied he did not know.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the dangerous want of sympathy between tower and\r\ntowed was witnessed by George and myself once up near Walton. It was\r\nwhere the tow-path shelves gently down into the water, and we were\r\ncamping on the opposite bank, noticing things in general. By-and-by a\r\nsmall boat came in sight, towed through the water at a tremendous pace\r\nby a powerful barge horse, on which sat a very small boy. Scattered\r\nabout the boat, in dreamy and reposeful attitudes, lay five fellows,\r\nthe man who was steering having a particularly restful appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see him pull the wrong line,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured George, as\r\nthey passed. And at that precise moment the man did it, and the boat\r\nrushed up the bank with a noise like the ripping up of forty thousand\r\nlinen sheets. Two men, a hamper, and three oars immediately left the\r\nboat on the larboard side, and reclined on the bank, and one and a half\r\nmoments afterwards, two other men disembarked from the starboard, and\r\nsat down among boat-hooks and sails and carpet-bags and bottles. The\r\nlast man went on twenty yards further, and then got out on his head.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to sort of lighten the boat, and it went on much easier,\r\nthe small boy shouting at the top of his voice, and urging his steed\r\ninto a gallop. The fellows sat up and stared at one another. It was\r\nsome seconds before they realised what had happened to them, but, when\r\nthey did, they began to shout lustily for the boy to stop. He, however,\r\nwas too much occupied with the horse to hear them, and we watched them,\r\nflying after him, until the distance hid them from view.\r\n\r\nI cannot say I was sorry at their mishap. Indeed, I only wish that all\r\nthe young fools who have their boats towed in this fashion\xe2\x80\x94and plenty\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94could meet with similar misfortunes. Besides the risk they run\r\nthemselves, they become a danger and an annoyance to every other boat\r\nthey pass. Going at the pace they do, it is impossible for them to get\r\nout of anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s way, or for anybody else to get out of theirs.\r\nTheir line gets hitched across your mast, and overturns you, or it\r\ncatches somebody in the boat, and either throws them into the water,\r\nor cuts their face open. The best plan is to stand your ground, and be\r\nprepared to keep them off with the butt-end of a mast.\r\n\r\nOf all experiences in connection with towing, the most exciting is\r\nbeing towed by girls. It is a sensation that nobody ought to miss. It\r\ntakes three girls to tow always; two hold the rope, and the other one\r\nruns round and round, and giggles. They generally begin by getting\r\nthemselves tied up. They get the line round their legs, and have to\r\nsit down on the path and undo each other, and then they twist it round\r\ntheir necks, and are nearly strangled. They fix it straight, however,\r\nat last, and start off at a run, pulling the boat along at quite a\r\ndangerous pace. At the end of a hundred yards they are naturally\r\nbreathless, and suddenly stop, and all sit down on the grass and laugh,\r\nand your boat drifts out to mid-stream and turns round, before you know\r\nwhat has happened, or can get hold of a scull. Then they stand up, and\r\nare surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, look!\xe2\x80\x9d they say; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s gone right out into the middle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Picture: Lady pinning up frock] They pull on pretty steadily for a\r\nbit, after this, and then it all at once occurs to one of them that she\r\nwill pin up her frock, and they ease up for the purpose, and the boat\r\nruns aground.\r\n\r\nYou jump up, and push it off, and you shout to them not to stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d they shout back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop,\xe2\x80\x9d you roar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t stop\xe2\x80\x94go on\xe2\x80\x94go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo back, Emily, and see what it is they want,\xe2\x80\x9d says one; and Emily\r\ncomes back, and asks what it is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d she says; \xe2\x80\x9canything happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d you reply, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all right; only go on, you know\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we can\xe2\x80\x99t steer, if you keep stopping. You must keep some way on\r\nthe boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep some what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome way\xe2\x80\x94you must keep the boat moving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, all right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell \xe2\x80\x99em. Are we doing it all right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, very nicely, indeed, only don\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem difficult at all. I thought it was so hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s simple enough. You want to keep on steady at it, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see. Give me out my red shawl, it\xe2\x80\x99s under the cushion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou find the shawl, and hand it out, and by this time another one has\r\ncome back and thinks she will have hers too, and they take Mary\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\nchance, and Mary does not want it, so they bring it back and have a\r\npocket-comb instead. It is about twenty minutes before they get off\r\nagain, and, at the next corner, they see a cow, and you have to leave\r\nthe boat to chivy the cow out of their way.\r\n\r\nThere is never a dull moment in the boat while girls are towing it.\r\n\r\nGeorge got the line right after a while, and towed us steadily on to\r\nPenton Hook. There we discussed the important question of camping. We\r\nhad decided to sleep on board that night, and we had either to lay\r\nup just about there, or go on past Staines. It seemed early to think\r\nabout shutting up then, however, with the sun still in the heavens, and\r\nwe settled to push straight on for Runnymead, three and a half miles\r\nfurther, a quiet wooded part of the river, and where there is good\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nWe all wished, however, afterward that we had stopped at Penton Hook.\r\nThree or four miles up stream is a trifle, early in the morning, but it\r\nis a weary pull at the end of a long day. You take no interest in the\r\nscenery during these last few miles. You do not chat and laugh. Every\r\nhalf-mile you cover seems like two. You can hardly believe you are only\r\nwhere you are, and you are convinced that the map must be wrong; and,\r\nwhen you have trudged along for what seems to you at least ten miles,\r\nand still the lock is not in sight, you begin to seriously fear that\r\nsomebody must have sneaked it, and run off with it.\r\n\r\nI remember being terribly upset once up the river (in a figurative\r\nsense, I mean). I was out with a young lady\xe2\x80\x94cousin on my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94and we were pulling down to Goring. It was rather late, and we\r\nwere anxious to get in\xe2\x80\x94at least _she_ was anxious to get in. It was\r\nhalf-past six when we reached Benson\xe2\x80\x99s lock, and dusk was drawing on,\r\nand she began to get excited then. She said she must be in to supper.\r\nI said it was a thing I felt I wanted to be in at, too; and I drew out\r\na map I had with me to see exactly how far it was. I saw it was just a\r\nmile and a half to the next lock\xe2\x80\x94Wallingford\xe2\x80\x94and five on from there to\r\nCleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be through the next lock before\r\nseven, and then there is only one more;\xe2\x80\x9d and I settled down and pulled\r\nsteadily away.\r\n\r\nWe passed the bridge, and soon after that I asked if she saw the lock.\r\nShe said no, she did not see any lock; and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and pulled on.\r\nAnother five minutes went by, and then I asked her to look again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t see any signs of a lock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94you are sure you know a lock, when you do see one?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked\r\nhesitatingly, not wishing to offend her.\r\n\r\nThe question did offend her, however, and she suggested that I had\r\nbetter look for myself; so I laid down the sculls, and took a view.\r\nThe river stretched out straight before us in the twilight for about a\r\nmile; not a ghost of a lock was to be seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have lost our way, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my companion.\r\n\r\nI did not see how that was possible; though, as I suggested, we might\r\nhave somehow got into the weir stream, and be making for the falls.\r\n\r\nThis idea did not comfort her in the least, and she began to cry. She\r\nsaid we should both be drowned, and that it was a judgment on her for\r\ncoming out with me.\r\n\r\nIt seemed an excessive punishment, I thought; but my cousin thought\r\nnot, and hoped it would all soon be over.\r\n\r\nI tried to reassure her, and to make light of the whole affair. I said\r\nthat the fact evidently was that I was not rowing as fast as I fancied\r\nI was, but that we should soon reach the lock now; and I pulled on for\r\nanother mile.\r\n\r\nThen I began to get nervous myself. I looked again at the map. There\r\nwas Wallingford lock, clearly marked, a mile and a half below Benson\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nIt was a good, reliable map; and, besides, I recollected the lock\r\nmyself. I had been through it twice. Where were we? What had happened\r\nto us? I began to think it must be all a dream, and that I was really\r\nasleep in bed, and should wake up in a minute, and be told it was past\r\nten.\r\n\r\nI asked my cousin if she thought it could be a dream, and she replied\r\nthat she was just about to ask me the same question; and then we both\r\nwondered if we were both asleep, and if so, who was the real one that\r\nwas dreaming, and who was the one that was only a dream; it got quite\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nI still went on pulling, however, and still no lock came in sight, and\r\nthe river grew more and more gloomy and mysterious under the gathering\r\nshadows of night, and things seemed to be getting weird and uncanny. I\r\nthought of hobgoblins and banshees, and will-o\xe2\x80\x99-the-wisps, and those\r\nwicked girls who sit up all night on rocks, and lure people into\r\nwhirl-pools and things; and I wished I had been a better man, and knew\r\nmore hymns; and in the middle of these reflections I heard the blessed\r\nstrains of \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got \xe2\x80\x99em on,\xe2\x80\x9d played, badly, on a concertina, and knew\r\nthat we were saved.\r\n\r\nI do not admire the tones of a concertina, as a rule; but, oh! how\r\nbeautiful the music seemed to us both then\xe2\x80\x94far, far more beautiful\r\nthan the voice of Orpheus or the lute of Apollo, or anything of that\r\nsort could have sounded. Heavenly melody, in our then state of mind,\r\nwould only have still further harrowed us. A soul-moving harmony,\r\ncorrectly performed, we should have taken as a spirit-warning, and\r\nhave given up all hope. But about the strains of \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got \xe2\x80\x99em on,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\njerked spasmodically, and with involuntary variations, out of a wheezy\r\naccordion, there was something singularly human and reassuring.\r\n\r\nThe sweet sounds drew nearer, and soon the boat from which they were\r\nworked lay alongside us.\r\n\r\nIt contained a party of provincial \xe2\x80\x99Arrys and \xe2\x80\x99Arriets, out for a\r\nmoonlight sail. (There was not any moon, but that was not their fault.)\r\nI never saw more attractive, lovable people in all my life. I hailed\r\nthem, and asked if they could tell me the way to Wallingford lock; and\r\nI explained that I had been looking for it for the last two hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWallingford lock!\xe2\x80\x9d they answered. \xe2\x80\x9cLor\xe2\x80\x99 love you, sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\ndone away with for over a year. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no Wallingford lock\r\nnow, sir. You\xe2\x80\x99re close to Cleeve now. Blow me tight if \xe2\x80\x99ere ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ngentleman been looking for Wallingford lock, Bill!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never thought of that. I wanted to fall upon all their necks and\r\nbless them; but the stream was running too strong just there to allow\r\nof this, so I had to content myself with mere cold-sounding words of\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nWe thanked them over and over again, and we said it was a lovely night,\r\nand we wished them a pleasant trip, and, I think, I invited them all\r\nto come and spend a week with me, and my cousin said her mother would\r\nbe so pleased to see them. And we sang the soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 chorus out of\r\n_Faust_, and got home in time for supper, after all.\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: People in rowing boat]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur first night.\xe2\x80\x94Under canvas.\xe2\x80\x94An appeal for help.\xe2\x80\x94Contrariness of\r\ntea-kettles, how to overcome.\xe2\x80\x94Supper.\xe2\x80\x94How to feel virtuous.\xe2\x80\x94Wanted! a\r\ncomfortably-appointed, well-drained desert island, neighbourhood of\r\nSouth Pacific Ocean preferred.\xe2\x80\x94Funny thing that happened to George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x94a restless night.\r\n\r\nHarris and I began to think that Bell Weir lock must have been done\r\naway with after the same manner. George had towed us up to Staines, and\r\nwe had taken the boat from there, and it seemed that we were dragging\r\nfifty tons after us, and were walking forty miles. It was half-past\r\nseven when we were through, and we all got in, and sculled up close to\r\nthe left bank, looking out for a spot to haul up in.\r\n\r\nWe had originally intended to go on to Magna Charta Island, a sweetly\r\npretty part of the river, where it winds through a soft, green valley,\r\nand to camp in one of the many picturesque inlets to be found round\r\nthat tiny shore. But, somehow, we did not feel that we yearned for the\r\npicturesque nearly so much now as we had earlier in the day. A bit of\r\nwater between a coal-barge and a gas-works would have quite satisfied\r\nus for that night. We did not want scenery. We wanted to have our\r\nsupper and go to bed. However, we did pull up to the point\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPicnic\r\nPoint,\xe2\x80\x9d it is called\xe2\x80\x94and dropped into a very pleasant nook under a\r\ngreat elm-tree, to the spreading roots of which we fastened the boat.\r\n\r\nThen we thought we were going to have supper (we had dispensed with\r\ntea, so as to save time), but George said no; that we had better get\r\nthe canvas up first, before it got quite dark, and while we could see\r\nwhat we were doing. Then, he said, all our work would be done, and we\r\ncould sit down to eat with an easy mind.\r\n\r\nThat canvas wanted more putting up than I think any of us had bargained\r\nfor. It looked so simple in the abstract. You took five iron arches,\r\nlike gigantic croquet hoops, and fitted them up over the boat, and then\r\nstretched the canvas over them, and fastened it down: it would take\r\nquite ten minutes, we thought.\r\n\r\nThat was an under-estimate.\r\n\r\nWe took up the hoops, and began to drop them into the sockets placed\r\nfor them. You would not imagine this to be dangerous work; but, looking\r\nback now, the wonder to me is that any of us are alive to tell the\r\ntale. They were not hoops, they were demons. First they would not fit\r\ninto their sockets at all, and we had to jump on them, and kick them,\r\nand hammer at them with the boat-hook; and, when they were in, it\r\nturned out that they were the wrong hoops for those particular sockets,\r\nand they had to come out again.\r\n\r\nBut they would not come out, until two of us had gone and struggled\r\nwith them for five minutes, when they would jump up suddenly, and\r\ntry and throw us into the water and drown us. They had hinges in the\r\nmiddle, and, when we were not looking, they nipped us with these hinges\r\nin delicate parts of the body; and, while we were wrestling with one\r\nside of the hoop, and endeavouring to persuade it to do its duty, the\r\nother side would come behind us in a cowardly manner, and hit us over\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nWe got them fixed at last, and then all that was to be done was to\r\narrange the covering over them. George unrolled it, and fastened one\r\nend over the nose of the boat. Harris stood in the middle to take it\r\nfrom George and roll it on to me, and I kept by the stern to receive\r\nit. It was a long time coming down to me. George did his part all\r\nright, but it was new work to Harris, and he bungled it.\r\n\r\nHow he managed it I do not know, he could not explain himself; but\r\nby some mysterious process or other he succeeded, after ten minutes\r\nof superhuman effort, in getting himself completely rolled up in\r\nit. He was so firmly wrapped round and tucked in and folded over,\r\nthat he could not get out. He, of course, made frantic struggles for\r\nfreedom\xe2\x80\x94the birthright of every Englishman,\xe2\x80\x94and, in doing so (I learned\r\nthis afterwards), knocked over George; and then George, swearing at\r\nHarris, began to struggle too, and got _himself_ entangled and rolled\r\nup.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Watching and waiting] I knew nothing about all this at the\r\ntime. I did not understand the business at all myself. I had been\r\ntold to stand where I was, and wait till the canvas came to me, and\r\nMontmorency and I stood there and waited, both as good as gold. We\r\ncould see the canvas being violently jerked and tossed about, pretty\r\nconsiderably; but we supposed this was part of the method, and did not\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\nWe also heard much smothered language coming from underneath it, and\r\nwe guessed that they were finding the job rather troublesome, and\r\nconcluded that we would wait until things had got a little simpler\r\nbefore we joined in.\r\n\r\nWe waited some time, but matters seemed to get only more and more\r\ninvolved, until, at last, George\xe2\x80\x99s head came wriggling out over the\r\nside of the boat, and spoke up.\r\n\r\nIt said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us a hand here, can\xe2\x80\x99t you, you cuckoo; standing there like a\r\nstuffed mummy, when you see we are both being suffocated, you dummy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never could withstand an appeal for help, so I went and undid them;\r\nnot before it was time, either, for Harris was nearly black in the face.\r\n\r\nIt took us half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s hard labour, after that, before it was\r\nproperly up, and then we cleared the decks, and got out supper. We put\r\nthe kettle on to boil, up in the nose of the boat, and went down to the\r\nstern and pretended to take no notice of it, but set to work to get the\r\nother things out.\r\n\r\nThat is the only way to get a kettle to boil up the river. If it sees\r\nthat you are waiting for it and are anxious, it will never even sing.\r\nYou have to go away and begin your meal, as if you were not going to\r\nhave any tea at all. You must not even look round at it. Then you will\r\nsoon hear it sputtering away, mad to be made into tea.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan, too, if you are in a great hurry, to talk very\r\nloudly to each other about how you don\xe2\x80\x99t need any tea, and are not\r\ngoing to have any. You get near the kettle, so that it can overhear\r\nyou, and then you shout out, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any tea; do you, George?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nto which George shouts back, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like tea; we\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nlemonade instead\xe2\x80\x94tea\xe2\x80\x99s so indigestible.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which the kettle boils\r\nover, and puts the stove out.\r\n\r\nWe adopted this harmless bit of trickery, and the result was that, by\r\nthe time everything else was ready, the tea was waiting. Then we lit\r\nthe lantern, and squatted down to supper.\r\n\r\nWe wanted that supper.\r\n\r\nFor five-and-thirty minutes not a sound was heard throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of that boat, save the clank of cutlery and\r\ncrockery, and the steady grinding of four sets of molars. At the end of\r\nfive-and-thirty minutes, Harris said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d and took his left leg out\r\nfrom under him and put his right one there instead.\r\n\r\nFive minutes afterwards, George said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d too, and threw his plate\r\nout on the bank; and, three minutes later than that, Montmorency gave\r\nthe first sign of contentment he had exhibited since we had started,\r\nand rolled over on his side, and spread his legs out; and then I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d and bent my head back, and bumped it against one of the hoops,\r\nbut I did not mind it. I did not even swear.\r\n\r\nHow good one feels when one is full\xe2\x80\x94how satisfied with ourselves\r\nand with the world! People who have tried it, tell me that a clear\r\nconscience makes you very happy and contented; but a full stomach\r\ndoes the business quite as well, and is cheaper, and more easily\r\nobtained. One feels so forgiving and generous after a substantial and\r\nwell-digested meal\xe2\x80\x94so noble-minded, so kindly-hearted.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange, this domination of our intellect by our digestive\r\norgans. We cannot work, we cannot think, unless our stomach wills so.\r\nIt dictates to us our emotions, our passions. After eggs and bacon,\r\nit says, \xe2\x80\x9cWork!\xe2\x80\x9d After beefsteak and porter, it says, \xe2\x80\x9cSleep!\xe2\x80\x9d After\r\na cup of tea (two spoonsful for each cup, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let it stand\r\nmore than three minutes), it says to the brain, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, rise, and show\r\nyour strength. Be eloquent, and deep, and tender; see, with a clear\r\neye, into Nature and into life; spread your white wings of quivering\r\nthought, and soar, a god-like spirit, over the whirling world beneath\r\nyou, up through long lanes of flaming stars to the gates of eternity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter hot muffins, it says, \xe2\x80\x9cBe dull and soulless, like a beast of the\r\nfield\xe2\x80\x94a brainless animal, with listless eye, unlit by any ray of fancy,\r\nor of hope, or fear, or love, or life.\xe2\x80\x9d And after brandy, taken in\r\nsufficient quantity, it says, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, come, fool, grin and tumble, that\r\nyour fellow-men may laugh\xe2\x80\x94drivel in folly, and splutter in senseless\r\nsounds, and show what a helpless ninny is poor man whose wit and will\r\nare drowned, like kittens, side by side, in half an inch of alcohol.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe are but the veriest, sorriest slaves of our stomach. Reach not after\r\nmorality and righteousness, my friends; watch vigilantly your stomach,\r\nand diet it with care and judgment. Then virtue and contentment will\r\ncome and reign within your heart, unsought by any effort of your own;\r\nand you will be a good citizen, a loving husband, and a tender father\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nnoble, pious man.\r\n\r\nBefore our supper, Harris and George and I were quarrelsome and\r\nsnappy and ill-tempered; after our supper, we sat and beamed on one\r\nanother, and we beamed upon the dog, too. We loved each other, we loved\r\neverybody. Harris, in moving about, trod on George\xe2\x80\x99s corn. Had this\r\nhappened before supper, George would have expressed wishes and desires\r\nconcerning Harris\xe2\x80\x99s fate in this world and the next that would have\r\nmade a thoughtful man shudder.\r\n\r\nAs it was, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cSteady, old man; \xe2\x80\x99ware wheat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Harris, instead of merely observing, in his most unpleasant tones,\r\nthat a fellow could hardly help treading on some bit of George\xe2\x80\x99s foot,\r\nif he had to move about at all within ten yards of where George was\r\nsitting, suggesting that George never ought to come into an ordinary\r\nsized boat with feet that length, and advising him to hang them over\r\nthe side, as he would have done before supper, now said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so\r\nsorry, old chap; I hope I haven\xe2\x80\x99t hurt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Picture: Smoking pipes] And George said: \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all;\xe2\x80\x9d that it was his\r\nfault; and Harris said no, it was his.\r\n\r\nIt was quite pretty to hear them.\r\n\r\nWe lit our pipes, and sat, looking out on the quiet night, and talked.\r\n\r\nGeorge said why could not we be always like this\xe2\x80\x94away from the world,\r\nwith its sin and temptation, leading sober, peaceful lives, and doing\r\ngood. I said it was the sort of thing I had often longed for myself;\r\nand we discussed the possibility of our going away, we four, to some\r\nhandy, well-fitted desert island, and living there in the woods.\r\n\r\nHarris said that the danger about desert islands, as far as he had\r\nheard, was that they were so damp: but George said no, not if properly\r\ndrained.\r\n\r\nAnd then we got on to drains, and that put George in mind of a very\r\nfunny thing that happened to his father once. He said his father was\r\ntravelling with another fellow through Wales, and, one night, they\r\nstopped at a little inn, where there were some other fellows, and they\r\njoined the other fellows, and spent the evening with them.\r\n\r\nThey had a very jolly evening, and sat up late, and, by the time they\r\ncame to go to bed, they (this was when George\xe2\x80\x99s father was a very young\r\nman) were slightly jolly, too. They (George\xe2\x80\x99s father and George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s friend) were to sleep in the same room, but in different beds.\r\nThey took the candle, and went up. The candle lurched up against the\r\nwall when they got into the room, and went out, and they had to undress\r\nand grope into bed in the dark. This they did; but, instead of getting\r\ninto separate beds, as they thought they were doing, they both climbed\r\ninto the same one without knowing it\xe2\x80\x94one getting in with his head\r\nat the top, and the other crawling in from the opposite side of the\r\ncompass, and lying with his feet on the pillow.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment, and then George\xe2\x80\x99s father said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, Tom?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe\xe2\x80\x99s voice from the other end of the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there\xe2\x80\x99s a man in my bed,\xe2\x80\x9d said George\xe2\x80\x99s father; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s his feet\r\non my pillow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary thing, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nblest if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a man in my bed, too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d asked George\xe2\x80\x99s father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to chuck him out,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d said George\xe2\x80\x99s father, valiantly.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief struggle, followed by two heavy bumps on the floor,\r\nand then a rather doleful voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Tom!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow have you got on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to tell you the truth, my man\xe2\x80\x99s chucked _me_ out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo\xe2\x80\x99s mine! I say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of this inn, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the name of that inn?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pig and Whistle,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, no, then it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d queried George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy it\xe2\x80\x99s so curious,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cbut precisely that very same\r\nthing happened to _my_ father once at a country inn. I\xe2\x80\x99ve often heard\r\nhim tell the tale. I thought it might have been the same inn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe turned in at ten that night, and I thought I should sleep well,\r\nbeing tired; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. As a rule, I undress and put my head on the\r\npillow, and then somebody bangs at the door, and says it is half-past\r\neight: but, to-night, everything seemed against me; the novelty of\r\nit all, the hardness of the boat, the cramped position (I was lying\r\nwith my feet under one seat, and my head on another), the sound of the\r\nlapping water round the boat, and the wind among the branches, kept me\r\nrestless and disturbed.\r\n\r\nI did get to sleep for a few hours, and then some part of the boat\r\nwhich seemed to have grown up in the night\xe2\x80\x94for it certainly was not\r\nthere when we started, and it had disappeared by the morning\xe2\x80\x94kept\r\ndigging into my spine. I slept through it for a while, dreaming that I\r\nhad swallowed a sovereign, and that they were cutting a hole in my back\r\nwith a gimlet, so as to try and get it out. I thought it very unkind\r\nof them, and I told them I would owe them the money, and they should\r\nhave it at the end of the month. But they would not hear of that, and\r\nsaid it would be much better if they had it then, because otherwise the\r\ninterest would accumulate so. I got quite cross with them after a bit,\r\nand told them what I thought of them, and then they gave the gimlet\r\nsuch an excruciating wrench that I woke up.\r\n\r\nThe boat seemed stuffy, and my head ached; so I thought I would step\r\nout into the cool night-air. I slipped on what clothes I could find\r\nabout\xe2\x80\x94some of my own, and some of George\xe2\x80\x99s and Harris\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and crept under\r\nthe canvas on to the bank.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious night. The moon had sunk, and left the quiet earth\r\nalone with the stars. It seemed as if, in the silence and the hush,\r\nwhile we her children slept, they were talking with her, their\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x94conversing of mighty mysteries in voices too vast and deep for\r\nchildish human ears to catch the sound.\r\n\r\nThey awe us, these strange stars, so cold, so clear. We are as children\r\nwhose small feet have strayed into some dim-lit temple of the god they\r\nhave been taught to worship but know not; and, standing where the\r\nechoing dome spans the long vista of the shadowy light, glance up, half\r\nhoping, half afraid to see some awful vision hovering there.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it seems so full of comfort and of strength, the night. In its\r\ngreat presence, our small sorrows creep away, ashamed. The day has been\r\nso full of fret and care, and our hearts have been so full of evil and\r\nof bitter thoughts, and the world has seemed so hard and wrong to us.\r\nThen Night, like some great loving mother, gently lays her hand upon\r\nour fevered head, and turns our little tear-stained faces up to hers,\r\nand smiles; and, though she does not speak, we know what she would say,\r\nand lay our hot flushed cheek against her bosom, and the pain is gone.\r\n\r\nSometimes, our pain is very deep and real, and we stand before her very\r\nsilent, because there is no language for our pain, only a moan. Night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart is full of pity for us: she cannot ease our aching; she takes our\r\nhand in hers, and the little world grows very small and very far away\r\nbeneath us, and, borne on her dark wings, we pass for a moment into a\r\nmightier Presence than her own, and in the wondrous light of that great\r\nPresence, all human life lies like a book before us, and we know that\r\nPain and Sorrow are but the angels of God.\r\n\r\nOnly those who have worn the crown of suffering can look upon that\r\nwondrous light; and they, when they return, may not speak of it, or\r\ntell the mystery they know.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, through a strange country, there rode some goodly\r\nknights, and their path lay by a deep wood, where tangled briars grew\r\nvery thick and strong, and tore the flesh of them that lost their way\r\ntherein. And the leaves of the trees that grew in the wood were very\r\ndark and thick, so that no ray of light came through the branches to\r\nlighten the gloom and sadness.\r\n\r\nAnd, as they passed by that dark wood, one knight of those that rode,\r\nmissing his comrades, wandered far away, and returned to them no more;\r\nand they, sorely grieving, rode on without him, mourning him as one\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nNow, when they reached the fair castle towards which they had been\r\njourneying, they stayed there many days, and made merry; and one night,\r\nas they sat in cheerful ease around the logs that burned in the great\r\nhall, and drank a loving measure, there came the comrade they had lost,\r\nand greeted them. His clothes were ragged, like a beggar\xe2\x80\x99s, and many\r\nsad wounds were on his sweet flesh, but upon his face there shone a\r\ngreat radiance of deep joy.\r\n\r\nAnd they questioned him, asking him what had befallen him: and he told\r\nthem how in the dark wood he had lost his way, and had wandered many\r\ndays and nights, till, torn and bleeding, he had lain him down to die.\r\n\r\nThen, when he was nigh unto death, lo! through the savage gloom there\r\ncame to him a stately maiden, and took him by the hand and led him on\r\nthrough devious paths, unknown to any man, until upon the darkness of\r\nthe wood there dawned a light such as the light of day was unto but as\r\na little lamp unto the sun; and, in that wondrous light, our way-worn\r\nknight saw as in a dream a vision, and so glorious, so fair the vision\r\nseemed, that of his bleeding wounds he thought no more, but stood as\r\none entranced, whose joy is deep as is the sea, whereof no man can tell\r\nthe depth.\r\n\r\nAnd the vision faded, and the knight, kneeling upon the ground, thanked\r\nthe good saint who into that sad wood had strayed his steps, so he had\r\nseen the vision that lay there hid.\r\n\r\nAnd the name of the dark forest was Sorrow; but of the vision that the\r\ngood knight saw therein we may not speak nor tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow George, once upon a time, got up early in the morning.\xe2\x80\x94George,\r\nHarris, and Montmorency do not like the look of the cold water.\xe2\x80\x94Heroism\r\nand determination on the part of J.\xe2\x80\x94George and his shirt: story with a\r\nmoral.\xe2\x80\x94Harris as cook.\xe2\x80\x94Historical retrospect, specially inserted for\r\nthe use of schools.\r\n\r\nI woke at six the next morning; and found George awake too. We both\r\nturned round, and tried to go to sleep again, but we could not. Had\r\nthere been any particular reason why we should not have gone to sleep\r\nagain, but have got up and dressed then and there, we should have\r\ndropped off while we were looking at our watches, and have slept till\r\nten. As there was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another\r\ntwo hours at the very least, and our getting up at that time was an\r\nutter absurdity, it was only in keeping with the natural cussedness of\r\nthings in general that we should both feel that lying down for five\r\nminutes more would be death to us.\r\n\r\nGeorge said that the same kind of thing, only worse, had happened to\r\nhim some eighteen months ago, when he was lodging by himself in the\r\nhouse of a certain Mrs. Gippings. He said his watch went wrong one\r\nevening, and stopped at a quarter-past eight. He did not know this at\r\nthe time because, for some reason or other, he forgot to wind it up\r\nwhen he went to bed (an unusual occurrence with him), and hung it up\r\nover his pillow without ever looking at the thing.\r\n\r\nIt was in the winter when this happened, very near the shortest day,\r\nand a week of fog into the bargain, so the fact that it was still very\r\ndark when George woke in the morning was no guide to him as to the\r\ntime. He reached up, and hauled down his watch. It was a quarter-past\r\neight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAngels and ministers of grace defend us!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed George; \xe2\x80\x9cand here\r\nhave I got to be in the City by nine. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t somebody call me?\r\nOh, this is a shame!\xe2\x80\x9d And he flung the watch down, and sprang out of\r\nbed, and had a cold bath, and washed himself, and dressed himself, and\r\nshaved himself in cold water because there was not time to wait for the\r\nhot, and then rushed and had another look at the watch.\r\n\r\nWhether the shaking it had received in being thrown down on the bed had\r\nstarted it, or how it was, George could not say, but certain it was\r\nthat from a quarter-past eight it had begun to go, and now pointed to\r\ntwenty minutes to nine.\r\n\r\nGeorge snatched it up, and rushed downstairs. In the sitting-room, all\r\nwas dark and silent: there was no fire, no breakfast. George said it\r\nwas a wicked shame of Mrs. G., and he made up his mind to tell her what\r\nhe thought of her when he came home in the evening. Then he dashed on\r\nhis great-coat and hat, and, seizing his umbrella, made for the front\r\ndoor. The door was not even unbolted. George anathematized Mrs. G. for\r\na lazy old woman, and thought it was very strange that people could not\r\nget up at a decent, respectable time, unlocked and unbolted the door,\r\nand ran out.\r\n\r\nHe ran hard for a quarter of a mile, and at the end of that distance\r\nit began to be borne in upon him as a strange and curious thing that\r\nthere were so few people about, and that there were no shops open. It\r\nwas certainly a very dark and foggy morning, but still it seemed an\r\nunusual course to stop all business on that account. _He_ had to go to\r\nbusiness: why should other people stop in bed merely because it was\r\ndark and foggy!\r\n\r\nAt length he reached Holborn. Not a shutter was down! not a bus was\r\nabout! There were three men in sight, one of whom was a policeman; a\r\nmarket-cart full of cabbages, and a dilapidated looking cab. George\r\npulled out his watch and looked at it: it was five minutes to nine! He\r\nstood still and counted his pulse. He stooped down and felt his legs.\r\nThen, with his watch still in his hand, he went up to the policeman,\r\nand asked him if he knew what the time was.\r\n\r\n[Picture: George and the policeman] \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the time?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man,\r\neyeing George up and down with evident suspicion; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, if you listen\r\nyou will hear it strike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge listened, and a neighbouring clock immediately obliged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s only gone three!\xe2\x80\x9d said George in an injured tone, when it had\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how many did you want it to go?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the constable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nine,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, showing his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where you live?\xe2\x80\x9d said the guardian of public order,\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nGeorge thought, and gave the address.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that\xe2\x80\x99s where it is, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man; \xe2\x80\x9cwell, you take my\r\nadvice and go there quietly, and take that watch of yours with you; and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s have any more of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd George went home again, musing as he walked along, and let himself\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAt first, when he got in, he determined to undress and go to bed again;\r\nbut when he thought of the redressing and re-washing, and the having of\r\nanother bath, he determined he would not, but would sit up and go to\r\nsleep in the easy-chair.\r\n\r\nBut he could not get to sleep: he never felt more wakeful in his life;\r\nso he lit the lamp and got out the chess-board, and played himself\r\na game of chess. But even that did not enliven him: it seemed slow\r\nsomehow; so he gave chess up and tried to read. He did not seem able\r\nto take any sort of interest in reading either, so he put on his coat\r\nagain and went out for a walk.\r\n\r\nIt was horribly lonesome and dismal, and all the policemen he met\r\nregarded him with undisguised suspicion, and turned their lanterns on\r\nhim and followed him about, and this had such an effect upon him at\r\nlast that he began to feel as if he really had done something, and he\r\ngot to slinking down the by-streets and hiding in dark doorways when he\r\nheard the regulation flip-flop approaching.\r\n\r\nOf course, this conduct made the force only more distrustful of him\r\nthan ever, and they would come and rout him out and ask him what he was\r\ndoing there; and when he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he had merely come out\r\nfor a stroll (it was then four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning), they looked\r\nas though they did not believe him, and two plain-clothes constables\r\ncame home with him to see if he really did live where he had said he\r\ndid. They saw him go in with his key, and then they took up a position\r\nopposite and watched the house.\r\n\r\nHe thought he would light the fire when he got inside, and make himself\r\nsome breakfast, just to pass away the time; but he did not seem able\r\nto handle anything from a scuttleful of coals to a teaspoon without\r\ndropping it or falling over it, and making such a noise that he was in\r\nmortal fear that it would wake Mrs. G. up, and that she would think it\r\nwas burglars and open the window and call \xe2\x80\x9cPolice!\xe2\x80\x9d and then these two\r\ndetectives would rush in and handcuff him, and march him off to the\r\npolice-court.\r\n\r\nHe was in a morbidly nervous state by this time, and he pictured the\r\ntrial, and his trying to explain the circumstances to the jury, and\r\nnobody believing him, and his being sentenced to twenty years\xe2\x80\x99 penal\r\nservitude, and his mother dying of a broken heart. So he gave up trying\r\nto get breakfast, and wrapped himself up in his overcoat and sat in the\r\neasy-chair till Mrs. G came down at half-past seven.\r\n\r\nHe said he had never got up too early since that morning: it had been\r\nsuch a warning to him.\r\n\r\nWe had been sitting huddled up in our rugs while George had been\r\ntelling me this true story, and on his finishing it I set to work to\r\nwake up Harris with a scull. The third prod did it: and he turned over\r\non the other side, and said he would be down in a minute, and that\r\nhe would have his lace-up boots. We soon let him know where he was,\r\nhowever, by the aid of the hitcher, and he sat up suddenly, sending\r\nMontmorency, who had been sleeping the sleep of the just right on the\r\nmiddle of his chest, sprawling across the boat.\r\n\r\nThen we pulled up the canvas, and all four of us poked our heads out\r\nover the off-side, and looked down at the water and shivered. The idea,\r\novernight, had been that we should get up early in the morning, fling\r\noff our rugs and shawls, and, throwing back the canvas, spring into the\r\nriver with a joyous shout, and revel in a long delicious swim. Somehow,\r\nnow the morning had come, the notion seemed less tempting. The water\r\nlooked damp and chilly: the wind felt cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be first in?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris at last.\r\n\r\nThere was no rush for precedence. George settled the matter so far as\r\nhe was concerned by retiring into the boat and pulling on his socks.\r\nMontmorency gave vent to an involuntary howl, as if merely thinking of\r\nthe thing had given him the horrors; and Harris said it would be so\r\ndifficult to get into the boat again, and went back and sorted out his\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nI did not altogether like to give in, though I did not relish the\r\nplunge. There might be snags about, or weeds, I thought. I meant to\r\ncompromise matters by going down to the edge and just throwing the\r\nwater over myself; so I took a towel and crept out on the bank and\r\nwormed my way along on to the branch of a tree that dipped down into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n[Picture: In the Thames] It was bitterly cold. The wind cut like a\r\nknife. I thought I would not throw the water over myself after all. I\r\nwould go back into the boat and dress; and I turned to do so; and, as I\r\nturned, the silly branch gave way, and I and the towel went in together\r\nwith a tremendous splash, and I was out mid-stream with a gallon of\r\nThames water inside me before I knew what had happened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! old J.\xe2\x80\x99s gone in,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard Harris say, as I came blowing to\r\nthe surface. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99d have the pluck to do it. Did you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it all right?\xe2\x80\x9d sung out George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLovely,\xe2\x80\x9d I spluttered back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are duffers not to come in. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have missed this for worlds. Why won\xe2\x80\x99t you try it? It only\r\nwants a little determination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I could not persuade them.\r\n\r\nRather an amusing thing happened while dressing that morning. I was\r\nvery cold when I got back into the boat, and, in my hurry to get my\r\nshirt on, I accidentally jerked it into the water. It made me awfully\r\nwild, especially as George burst out laughing. I could not see anything\r\nto laugh at, and I told George so, and he only laughed the more. I\r\nnever saw a man laugh so much. I quite lost my temper with him at last,\r\nand I pointed out to him what a drivelling maniac of an imbecile idiot\r\nhe was; but he only roared the louder. And then, just as I was landing\r\nthe shirt, I noticed that it was not my shirt at all, but George\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nwhich I had mistaken for mine; whereupon the humour of the thing struck\r\nme for the first time, and I began to laugh. And the more I looked from\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s wet shirt to George, roaring with laughter, the more I was\r\namused, and I laughed so much that I had to let the shirt fall back\r\ninto the water again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAr\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x94going to get it out?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, between his shrieks.\r\n\r\nI could not answer him at all for a while, I was laughing so, but, at\r\nlast, between my peals I managed to jerk out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t my shirt\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s _yours_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never saw a man\xe2\x80\x99s face change from lively to severe so suddenly in\r\nall my life before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled, springing up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou silly cuckoo! Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you be\r\nmore careful what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing? Why the deuce don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and dress\r\non the bank? You\xe2\x80\x99re not fit to be in a boat, you\xe2\x80\x99re not. Gimme the\r\nhitcher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to make him see the fun of the thing, but he could not. George\r\nis very dense at seeing a joke sometimes.\r\n\r\nHarris proposed that we should have scrambled eggs for breakfast. He\r\nsaid he would cook them. It seemed, from his account, that he was very\r\ngood at doing scrambled eggs. He often did them at picnics and when out\r\non yachts. He was quite famous for them. People who had once tasted his\r\nscrambled eggs, so we gathered from his conversation, never cared for\r\nany other food afterwards, but pined away and died when they could not\r\nget them.\r\n\r\nIt made our mouths water to hear him talk about the things, and we\r\nhanded him out the stove and the frying-pan and all the eggs that had\r\nnot smashed and gone over everything in the hamper, and begged him to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nHe had some trouble in breaking the eggs\xe2\x80\x94or rather not so much trouble\r\nin breaking them exactly as in getting them into the frying-pan when\r\nbroken, and keeping them off his trousers, and preventing them from\r\nrunning up his sleeve; but he fixed some half-a-dozen into the pan at\r\nlast, and then squatted down by the side of the stove and chivied them\r\nabout with a fork.\r\n\r\nIt seemed harassing work, so far as George and I could judge. Whenever\r\nhe went near the pan he burned himself, and then he would drop\r\neverything and dance round the stove, flicking his fingers about and\r\ncursing the things. Indeed, every time George and I looked round at him\r\nhe was sure to be performing this feat. We thought at first that it was\r\na necessary part of the culinary arrangements.\r\n\r\nWe did not know what scrambled eggs were, and we fancied that it must\r\nbe some Red Indian or Sandwich Islands sort of dish that required\r\ndances and incantations for its proper cooking. Montmorency went and\r\nput his nose over it once, and the fat spluttered up and scalded him,\r\nand then _he_ began dancing and cursing. Altogether it was one of the\r\nmost interesting and exciting operations I have ever witnessed. George\r\nand I were both quite sorry when it was over.\r\n\r\nThe result was not altogether the success that Harris had anticipated.\r\nThere seemed so little to show for the business. Six eggs had gone into\r\nthe frying-pan, and all that came out was a teaspoonful of burnt and\r\nunappetizing looking mess.\r\n\r\nHarris said it was the fault of the frying-pan, and thought it would\r\nhave gone better if we had had a fish-kettle and a gas-stove; and\r\nwe decided not to attempt the dish again until we had those aids to\r\nhousekeeping by us.\r\n\r\nThe sun had got more powerful by the time we had finished breakfast,\r\nand the wind had dropped, and it was as lovely a morning as one could\r\ndesire. Little was in sight to remind us of the nineteenth century;\r\nand, as we looked out upon the river in the morning sunlight, we could\r\nalmost fancy that the centuries between us and that ever-to-be-famous\r\nJune morning of 1215 had been drawn aside, and that we, English\r\nyeomen\xe2\x80\x99s sons in homespun cloth, with dirk at belt, were waiting there\r\nto witness the writing of that stupendous page of history, the meaning\r\nwhereof was to be translated to the common people some four hundred and\r\nodd years later by one Oliver Cromwell, who had deeply studied it.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine summer morning\xe2\x80\x94sunny, soft, and still. But through the air\r\nthere runs a thrill of coming stir. King John has slept at Duncroft\r\nHall, and all the day before the little town of Staines has echoed to\r\nthe clang of armed men, and the clatter of great horses over its rough\r\nstones, and the shouts of captains, and the grim oaths and surly jests\r\nof bearded bowmen, billmen, pikemen, and strange-speaking foreign\r\nspearmen.\r\n\r\nGay-cloaked companies of knights and squires have ridden in, all\r\ntravel-stained and dusty. And all the evening long the timid townsmen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoors have had to be quick opened to let in rough groups of soldiers,\r\nfor whom there must be found both board and lodging, and the best of\r\nboth, or woe betide the house and all within; for the sword is judge\r\nand jury, plaintiff and executioner, in these tempestuous times, and\r\npays for what it takes by sparing those from whom it takes it, if it\r\npleases it to do so.\r\n\r\nRound the camp-fire in the market-place gather still more of the\r\nBarons\xe2\x80\x99 troops, and eat and drink deep, and bellow forth roystering\r\ndrinking songs, and gamble and quarrel as the evening grows and deepens\r\ninto night. The firelight sheds quaint shadows on their piled-up arms\r\nand on their uncouth forms. The children of the town steal round to\r\nwatch them, wondering; and brawny country wenches, laughing, draw near\r\nto bandy ale-house jest and jibe with the swaggering troopers, so\r\nunlike the village swains, who, now despised, stand apart behind, with\r\nvacant grins upon their broad, peering faces. And out from the fields\r\naround, glitter the faint lights of more distant camps, as here some\r\ngreat lord\xe2\x80\x99s followers lie mustered, and there false John\xe2\x80\x99s French\r\nmercenaries hover like crouching wolves without the town.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with sentinel in each dark street, and twinkling watch-fires on\r\neach height around, the night has worn away, and over this fair valley\r\nof old Thame has broken the morning of the great day that is to close\r\nso big with the fate of ages yet unborn.\r\n\r\nEver since grey dawn, in the lower of the two islands, just above where\r\nwe are standing, there has been great clamour, and the sound of many\r\nworkmen. The great pavilion brought there yester eve is being raised,\r\nand carpenters are busy nailing tiers of seats, while \xe2\x80\x99prentices from\r\nLondon town are there with many-coloured stuffs and silks and cloth of\r\ngold and silver.\r\n\r\nAnd now, lo! down upon the road that winds along the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank from\r\nStaines there come towards us, laughing and talking together in deep\r\nguttural bass, a half-a-score of stalwart halbert-men\xe2\x80\x94Barons\xe2\x80\x99 men,\r\nthese\xe2\x80\x94and halt at a hundred yards or so above us, on the other bank,\r\nand lean upon their arms, and wait.\r\n\r\nAnd so, from hour to hour, march up along the road ever fresh groups\r\nand bands of armed men, their casques and breastplates flashing back\r\nthe long low lines of morning sunlight, until, as far as eye can reach,\r\nthe way seems thick with glittering steel and prancing steeds. And\r\nshouting horsemen are galloping from group to group, and little banners\r\nare fluttering lazily in the warm breeze, and every now and then there\r\nis a deeper stir as the ranks make way on either side, and some great\r\nBaron on his war-horse, with his guard of squires around him, passes\r\nalong to take his station at the head of his serfs and vassals.\r\n\r\nAnd up the slope of Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s Hill, just opposite, are gathered the\r\nwondering rustics and curious townsfolk, who have run from Staines,\r\nand none are quite sure what the bustle is about, but each one has a\r\ndifferent version of the great event that they have come to see; and\r\nsome say that much good to all the people will come from this day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork; but the old men shake their heads, for they have heard such tales\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAnd all the river down to Staines is dotted with small craft and boats\r\nand tiny coracles\xe2\x80\x94which last are growing out of favour now, and are\r\nused only by the poorer folk. Over the rapids, where in after years\r\ntrim Bell Weir lock will stand, they have been forced or dragged by\r\ntheir sturdy rowers, and now are crowding up as near as they dare come\r\nto the great covered barges, which lie in readiness to bear King John\r\nto where the fateful Charter waits his signing.\r\n\r\nIt is noon, and we and all the people have been waiting patient for\r\nmany an hour, and the rumour has run round that slippery John has again\r\nescaped from the Barons\xe2\x80\x99 grasp, and has stolen away from Duncroft Hall\r\nwith his mercenaries at his heels, and will soon be doing other work\r\nthan signing charters for his people\xe2\x80\x99s liberty.\r\n\r\nNot so! This time the grip upon him has been one of iron, and he has\r\nslid and wriggled in vain. Far down the road a little cloud of dust\r\nhas risen, and draws nearer and grows larger, and the pattering of\r\nmany hoofs grows louder, and in and out between the scattered groups\r\nof drawn-up men, there pushes on its way a brilliant cavalcade of\r\ngay-dressed lords and knights. And front and rear, and either flank,\r\nthere ride the yeomen of the Barons, and in the midst King John.\r\n\r\nHe rides to where the barges lie in readiness, and the great Barons\r\nstep forth from their ranks to meet him. He greets them with a smile\r\nand laugh, and pleasant honeyed words, as though it were some feast in\r\nhis honour to which he had been invited. But as he rises to dismount,\r\nhe casts one hurried glance from his own French mercenaries drawn up in\r\nthe rear to the grim ranks of the Barons\xe2\x80\x99 men that hem him in.\r\n\r\nIs it too late? One fierce blow at the unsuspecting horseman at his\r\nside, one cry to his French troops, one desperate charge upon the\r\nunready lines before him, and these rebellious Barons might rue the\r\nday they dared to thwart his plans! A bolder hand might have turned\r\nthe game even at that point. Had it been a Richard there! the cup of\r\nliberty might have been dashed from England\xe2\x80\x99s lips, and the taste of\r\nfreedom held back for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nBut the heart of King John sinks before the stern faces of the English\r\nfighting men, and the arm of King John drops back on to his rein, and\r\nhe dismounts and takes his seat in the foremost barge. And the Barons\r\nfollow in, with each mailed hand upon the sword-hilt, and the word is\r\ngiven to let go.\r\n\r\nSlowly the heavy, bright-decked barges leave the shore of Runningmede.\r\nSlowly against the swift current they work their ponderous way, till,\r\nwith a low grumble, they grate against the bank of the little island\r\nthat from this day will bear the name of Magna Charta Island. And King\r\nJohn has stepped upon the shore, and we wait in breathless silence till\r\na great shout cleaves the air, and the great cornerstone in England\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemple of liberty has, now we know, been firmly laid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. and Anne Boleyn.\xe2\x80\x94Disadvantages of living in same house\r\nwith pair of lovers.\xe2\x80\x94A trying time for the English nation.\xe2\x80\x94A\r\nnight search for the picturesque.\xe2\x80\x94Homeless and houseless.\xe2\x80\x94Harris\r\nprepares to die.\xe2\x80\x94An angel comes along.\xe2\x80\x94Effect of sudden joy on\r\nHarris.\xe2\x80\x94A little supper.\xe2\x80\x94Lunch.\xe2\x80\x94High price for mustard.\xe2\x80\x94A fearful\r\nbattle.\xe2\x80\x94Maidenhead.\xe2\x80\x94Sailing.\xe2\x80\x94Three fishers.\xe2\x80\x94We are cursed.\r\n\r\nI was sitting on the bank, conjuring up this scene to myself, when\r\nGeorge remarked that when I was quite rested, perhaps I would not mind\r\nhelping to wash up; and, thus recalled from the days of the glorious\r\npast to the prosaic present, with all its misery and sin, I slid down\r\ninto the boat and cleaned out the frying-pan with a stick of wood and a\r\ntuft of grass, polishing it up finally with George\xe2\x80\x99s wet shirt.\r\n\r\nWe went over to Magna Charta Island, and had a look at the stone which\r\nstands in the cottage there and on which the great Charter is said to\r\nhave been signed; though, as to whether it really was signed there, or,\r\nas some say, on the other bank at \xe2\x80\x9cRunningmede,\xe2\x80\x9d I decline to commit\r\nmyself. As far as my own personal opinion goes, however, I am inclined\r\nto give weight to the popular island theory. Certainly, had I been\r\none of the Barons, at the time, I should have strongly urged upon my\r\ncomrades the advisability of our getting such a slippery customer as\r\nKing John on to the island, where there was less chance of surprises\r\nand tricks.\r\n\r\nThere are the ruins of an old priory in the grounds of Ankerwyke House,\r\nwhich is close to Picnic Point, and it was round about the grounds of\r\nthis old priory that Henry VIII. is said to have waited for and met\r\nAnne Boleyn. He also used to meet her at Hever Castle in Kent, and also\r\nsomewhere near St. Albans. It must have been difficult for the people\r\nof England in those days to have found a spot where these thoughtless\r\nyoung folk were _not_ spooning.\r\n\r\nHave you ever been in a house where there are a couple courting? It is\r\nmost trying. You think you will go and sit in the drawing-room, and you\r\nmarch off there. As you open the door, you hear a noise as if somebody\r\nhad suddenly recollected something, and, when you get in, Emily is\r\nover by the window, full of interest in the opposite side of the road,\r\nand your friend, John Edward, is at the other end of the room with his\r\nwhole soul held in thrall by photographs of other people\xe2\x80\x99s relatives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d you say, pausing at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody was here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d says Emily, coldly, in a tone which implies that she\r\ndoes not believe you.\r\n\r\nYou hang about for a bit, then you say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very dark. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you light the gas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJohn Edward says, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed it; and Emily says that papa\r\ndoes not like the gas lit in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nYou tell them one or two items of news, and give them your views and\r\nopinions on the Irish question; but this does not appear to interest\r\nthem. All they remark on any subject is, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDid he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d And, after ten minutes of such style of\r\nconversation, you edge up to the door, and slip out, and are surprised\r\nto find that the door immediately closes behind you, and shuts itself,\r\nwithout your having touched it.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later, you think you will try a pipe in the conservatory.\r\nThe only chair in the place is occupied by Emily; and John Edward, if\r\nthe language of clothes can be relied upon, has evidently been sitting\r\non the floor. They do not speak, but they give you a look that says all\r\nthat can be said in a civilised community; and you back out promptly\r\nand shut the door behind you.\r\n\r\nYou are afraid to poke your nose into any room in the house now; so,\r\nafter walking up and down the stairs for a while, you go and sit in\r\nyour own bedroom. This becomes uninteresting, however, after a time,\r\nand so you put on your hat and stroll out into the garden. You walk\r\ndown the path, and as you pass the summer-house you glance in, and\r\nthere are those two young idiots, huddled up into one corner of it; and\r\nthey see you, and are evidently under the idea that, for some wicked\r\npurpose of your own, you are following them about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t they have a special room for this sort of thing, and make\r\npeople keep to it?\xe2\x80\x9d you mutter; and you rush back to the hall and get\r\nyour umbrella and go out.\r\n\r\nIt must have been much like this when that foolish boy Henry VIII.\r\nwas courting his little Anne. People in Buckinghamshire would have\r\ncome upon them unexpectedly when they were mooning round Windsor and\r\nWraysbury, and have exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! you here!\xe2\x80\x9d and Henry would have\r\nblushed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes; he\xe2\x80\x99d just come over to see a man;\xe2\x80\x9d and Anne\r\nwould have said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad to see you! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny? I\xe2\x80\x99ve just\r\nmet Mr. Henry VIII. in the lane, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going the same way I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen those people would have gone away and said to themselves: \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99d better get out of here while this billing and cooing is on. We\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo down to Kent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they would go to Kent, and the first thing they would see in Kent,\r\nwhen they got there, would be Henry and Anne fooling round Hever Castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, drat this!\xe2\x80\x9d they would have said. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, let\xe2\x80\x99s go away. I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstand any more of it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to St. Albans\xe2\x80\x94nice quiet place, St.\r\nAlbans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: River scene]\r\n\r\nAnd when they reached St. Albans, there would be that wretched couple,\r\nkissing under the Abbey walls. Then these folks would go and be pirates\r\nuntil the marriage was over.\r\n\r\nFrom Picnic Point to Old Windsor Lock is a delightful bit of the river.\r\nA shady road, dotted here and there with dainty little cottages, runs\r\nby the bank up to the \xe2\x80\x9cBells of Ouseley,\xe2\x80\x9d a picturesque inn, as most\r\nup-river inns are, and a place where a very good glass of ale may\r\nbe drunk\xe2\x80\x94so Harris says; and on a matter of this kind you can take\r\nHarris\xe2\x80\x99s word. Old Windsor is a famous spot in its way. Edward the\r\nConfessor had a palace here, and here the great Earl Godwin was proved\r\nguilty by the justice of that age of having encompassed the death of\r\nthe King\xe2\x80\x99s brother. Earl Godwin broke a piece of bread and held it in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Earl, \xe2\x80\x9cmay this bread choke me when I eat\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he put the bread into his mouth and swallowed it, and it choked\r\nhim, and he died.\r\n\r\nAfter you pass Old Windsor, the river is somewhat uninteresting, and\r\ndoes not become itself again until you are nearing Boveney. George and\r\nI towed up past the Home Park, which stretches along the right bank\r\nfrom Albert to Victoria Bridge; and as we were passing Datchet, George\r\nasked me if I remembered our first trip up the river, and when we\r\nlanded at Datchet at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, and wanted to go to bed.\r\n\r\nI answered that I did remember it. It will be some time before I forget\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was the Saturday before the August Bank Holiday. We were tired and\r\nhungry, we same three, and when we got to Datchet we took out the\r\nhamper, the two bags, and the rugs and coats, and such like things, and\r\nstarted off to look for diggings. We passed a very pretty little hotel,\r\nwith clematis and creeper over the porch; but there was no honeysuckle\r\nabout it, and, for some reason or other, I had got my mind fixed on\r\nhoneysuckle, and I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t let\xe2\x80\x99s go in there! Let\xe2\x80\x99s go on a bit further, and see if\r\nthere isn\xe2\x80\x99t one with honeysuckle over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we went on till we came to another hotel. That was a very nice\r\nhotel, too, and it had honey-suckle on it, round at the side; but\r\nHarris did not like the look of a man who was leaning against the front\r\ndoor. He said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look a nice man at all, and he wore ugly boots:\r\nso we went on further. We went a goodish way without coming across any\r\nmore hotels, and then we met a man, and asked him to direct us to a few.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are coming away from them. You must turn right round and go\r\nback, and then you will come to the Stag.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, we had been there, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it\xe2\x80\x94no honeysuckle over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s the Manor House, just opposite. Have\r\nyou tried that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris replied that we did not want to go there\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the looks\r\nof a man who was stopping there\xe2\x80\x94Harris did not like the colour of his\r\nhair, didn\xe2\x80\x99t like his boots, either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ll do, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said our informant;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause they are the only two inns in the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo other inns!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Harris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harris.\r\n\r\nThen George spoke up. He said Harris and I could get an hotel built for\r\nus, if we liked, and have some people made to put in. For his part, he\r\nwas going back to the Stag.\r\n\r\nThe greatest minds never realise their ideals in any matter; and Harris\r\nand I sighed over the hollowness of all earthly desires, and followed\r\nGeorge.\r\n\r\nWe took our traps into the Stag, and laid them down in the hall.\r\n\r\nThe landlord came up and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood evening, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cwe want three beds, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we can\xe2\x80\x99t manage\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo will do. Two of us can sleep\r\nin one bed, can\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, turning to Harris and me.\r\n\r\nHarris said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes;\xe2\x80\x9d he thought George and I could sleep in one bed\r\nvery easily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d again repeated the landlord: \xe2\x80\x9cbut we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot a bed vacant in the whole house. In fact, we are putting two, and\r\neven three gentlemen in one bed, as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis staggered us for a bit.\r\n\r\nBut Harris, who is an old traveller, rose to the occasion, and,\r\nlaughing cheerily, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, we can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. We must rough it. You must give us a\r\nshake-down in the billiard-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery sorry, sir. Three gentlemen sleeping on the billiard-table\r\nalready, and two in the coffee-room. Can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly take you in\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe picked up our things, and went over to the Manor House. It was a\r\npretty little place. I said I thought I should like it better than the\r\nother house; and Harris said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d it would be all right, and we\r\nneedn\xe2\x80\x99t look at the man with the red hair; besides, the poor fellow\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help having red hair.\r\n\r\nHarris spoke quite kindly and sensibly about it.\r\n\r\nThe people at the Manor House did not wait to hear us talk. The\r\nlandlady met us on the doorstep with the greeting that we were the\r\nfourteenth party she had turned away within the last hour and a half.\r\nAs for our meek suggestions of stables, billiard-room, or coal-cellars,\r\nshe laughed them all to scorn: all these nooks had been snatched up\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\nDid she know of any place in the whole village where we could get\r\nshelter for the night?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind roughing it\xe2\x80\x94she did not recommend it, mind\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nthere was a little beershop half a mile down the Eton road\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe waited to hear no more; we caught up the hamper and the bags, and\r\nthe coats and rugs, and parcels, and ran. The distance seemed more like\r\na mile than half a mile, but we reached the place at last, and rushed,\r\npanting, into the bar.\r\n\r\nThe people at the beershop were rude. They merely laughed at us.\r\nThere were only three beds in the whole house, and they had seven\r\nsingle gentlemen and two married couples sleeping there already. A\r\nkind-hearted bargeman, however, who happened to be in the tap-room,\r\nthought we might try the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s, next door to the Stag, and we went\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe grocer\xe2\x80\x99s was full. An old woman we met in the shop then kindly took\r\nus along with her for a quarter of a mile, to a lady friend of hers,\r\nwho occasionally let rooms to gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThis old woman walked very slowly, and we were twenty minutes getting\r\nto her lady friend\xe2\x80\x99s. She enlivened the journey by describing to us, as\r\nwe trailed along, the various pains she had in her back.\r\n\r\nHer lady friend\xe2\x80\x99s rooms were let. From there we were recommended to No.\r\n27. No. 27 was full, and sent us to No. 32, and 32 was full.\r\n\r\nThen we went back into the high road, and Harris sat down on the hamper\r\nand said he would go no further. He said it seemed a quiet spot, and he\r\nwould like to die there. He requested George and me to kiss his mother\r\nfor him, and to tell all his relations that he forgave them and died\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nAt that moment an angel came by in the disguise of a small boy (and\r\nI cannot think of any more effective disguise an angel could have\r\nassumed), with a can of beer in one hand, and in the other something\r\nat the end of a string, which he let down on to every flat stone he\r\ncame across, and then pulled up again, this producing a peculiarly\r\nunattractive sound, suggestive of suffering.\r\n\r\nWe asked this heavenly messenger (as we discovered him afterwards to\r\nbe) if he knew of any lonely house, whose occupants were few and feeble\r\n(old ladies or paralysed gentlemen preferred), who could be easily\r\nfrightened into giving up their beds for the night to three desperate\r\nmen; or, if not this, could he recommend us to an empty pigstye, or a\r\ndisused limekiln, or anything of that sort. He did not know of any such\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x94at least, not one handy; but he said that, if we liked to come\r\nwith him, his mother had a room to spare, and could put us up for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWe fell upon his neck there in the moonlight and blessed him, and it\r\nwould have made a very beautiful picture if the boy himself had not\r\nbeen so over-powered by our emotion as to be unable to sustain himself\r\nunder it, and sunk to the ground, letting us all down on top of him.\r\nHarris was so overcome with joy that he fainted, and had to seize the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s beer-can and half empty it before he could recover consciousness,\r\nand then he started off at a run, and left George and me to bring on\r\nthe luggage.\r\n\r\nIt was a little four-roomed cottage where the boy lived, and his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94good soul!\xe2\x80\x94gave us hot bacon for supper, and we ate it all\xe2\x80\x94five\r\npounds\xe2\x80\x94and a jam tart afterwards, and two pots of tea, and then we went\r\nto bed. There were two beds in the room; one was a 2ft. 6in. truckle\r\nbed, and George and I slept in that, and kept in by tying ourselves\r\ntogether with a sheet; and the other was the little boy\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and\r\nHarris had that all to himself, and we found him, in the morning, with\r\ntwo feet of bare leg sticking out at the bottom, and George and I used\r\nit to hang the towels on while we bathed.\r\n\r\nWe were not so uppish about what sort of hotel we would have, next time\r\nwe went to Datchet.\r\n\r\nTo return to our present trip: nothing exciting happened, and we tugged\r\nsteadily on to a little below Monkey Island, where we drew up and\r\nlunched. We tackled the cold beef for lunch, and then we found that we\r\nhad forgotten to bring any mustard. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever in my life,\r\nbefore or since, felt I wanted mustard as badly as I felt I wanted it\r\nthen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for mustard as a rule, and it is very seldom that I\r\ntake it at all, but I would have given worlds for it then.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many worlds there may be in the universe, but anyone\r\nwho had brought me a spoonful of mustard at that precise moment could\r\nhave had them all. I grow reckless like that when I want a thing and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\r\n\r\nHarris said he would have given worlds for mustard too. It would have\r\nbeen a good thing for anybody who had come up to that spot with a can\r\nof mustard, then: he would have been set up in worlds for the rest of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nBut there! I daresay both Harris and I would have tried to back out of\r\nthe bargain after we had got the mustard. One makes these extravagant\r\noffers in moments of excitement, but, of course, when one comes to\r\nthink of it, one sees how absurdly out of proportion they are with the\r\nvalue of the required article. I heard a man, going up a mountain in\r\nSwitzerland, once say he would give worlds for a glass of beer, and,\r\nwhen he came to a little shanty where they kept it, he kicked up a most\r\nfearful row because they charged him five francs for a bottle of Bass.\r\nHe said it was a scandalous imposition, and he wrote to the _Times_\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nIt cast a gloom over the boat, there being no mustard. We ate our beef\r\nin silence. Existence seemed hollow and uninteresting. We thought\r\nof the happy days of childhood, and sighed. We brightened up a bit,\r\nhowever, over the apple-tart, and, when George drew out a tin of\r\npine-apple from the bottom of the hamper, and rolled it into the middle\r\nof the boat, we felt that life was worth living after all.\r\n\r\nWe are very fond of pine-apple, all three of us. We looked at the\r\npicture on the tin; we thought of the juice. We smiled at one another,\r\nand Harris got a spoon ready.\r\n\r\nThen we looked for the knife to open the tin with. We turned out\r\neverything in the hamper. We turned out the bags. We pulled up the\r\nboards at the bottom of the boat. We took everything out on to the bank\r\nand shook it. There was no tin-opener to be found.\r\n\r\nThen Harris tried to open the tin with a pocket-knife, and broke the\r\nknife and cut himself badly; and George tried a pair of scissors, and\r\nthe scissors flew up, and nearly put his eye out. While they were\r\ndressing their wounds, I tried to make a hole in the thing with the\r\nspiky end of the hitcher, and the hitcher slipped and jerked me out\r\nbetween the boat and the bank into two feet of muddy water, and the tin\r\nrolled over, uninjured, and broke a teacup.\r\n\r\nThen we all got mad. We took that tin out on the bank, and Harris went\r\nup into a field and got a big sharp stone, and I went back into the\r\nboat and brought out the mast, and George held the tin and Harris held\r\nthe sharp end of his stone against the top of it, and I took the mast\r\nand poised it high up in the air, and gathered up all my strength and\r\nbrought it down.\r\n\r\nIt was George\xe2\x80\x99s straw hat that saved his life that day. He keeps that\r\nhat now (what is left of it), and, of a winter\xe2\x80\x99s evening, when the\r\npipes are lit and the boys are telling stretchers about the dangers\r\nthey have passed through, George brings it down and shows it round, and\r\nthe stirring tale is told anew, with fresh exaggerations every time.\r\n\r\nHarris got off with merely a flesh wound.\r\n\r\nAfter that, I took the tin off myself, and hammered at it with the mast\r\ntill I was worn out and sick at heart, whereupon Harris took it in hand.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Flattened tin] We beat it out flat; we beat it back square;\r\nwe battered it into every form known to geometry\xe2\x80\x94but we could not make\r\na hole in it. Then George went at it, and knocked it into a shape, so\r\nstrange, so weird, so unearthly in its wild hideousness, that he got\r\nfrightened and threw away the mast. Then we all three sat round it on\r\nthe grass and looked at it.\r\n\r\nThere was one great dent across the top that had the appearance of a\r\nmocking grin, and it drove us furious, so that Harris rushed at the\r\nthing, and caught it up, and flung it far into the middle of the river,\r\nand as it sank we hurled our curses at it, and we got into the boat and\r\nrowed away from the spot, and never paused till we reached Maidenhead.\r\n\r\nMaidenhead itself is too snobby to be pleasant. It is the haunt of\r\nthe river swell and his overdressed female companion. It is the\r\ntown of showy hotels, patronised chiefly by dudes and ballet girls.\r\nIt is the witch\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen from which go forth those demons of the\r\nriver\xe2\x80\x94steam-launches. The _London Journal_ duke always has his \xe2\x80\x9clittle\r\nplace\xe2\x80\x9d at Maidenhead; and the heroine of the three-volume novel always\r\ndines there when she goes out on the spree with somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s husband.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: River scene]\r\n\r\nWe went through Maidenhead quickly, and then eased up, and took\r\nleisurely that grand reach beyond Boulter\xe2\x80\x99s and Cookham locks.\r\nClieveden Woods still wore their dainty dress of spring, and rose\r\nup, from the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, in one long harmony of blended shades of\r\nfairy green. In its unbroken loveliness this is, perhaps, the sweetest\r\nstretch of all the river, and lingeringly we slowly drew our little\r\nboat away from its deep peace.\r\n\r\nWe pulled up in the backwater, just below Cookham, and had tea; and,\r\nwhen we were through the lock, it was evening. A stiffish breeze had\r\nsprung up\xe2\x80\x94in our favour, for a wonder; for, as a rule on the river,\r\nthe wind is always dead against you whatever way you go. It is against\r\nyou in the morning, when you start for a day\xe2\x80\x99s trip, and you pull a\r\nlong distance, thinking how easy it will be to come back with the sail.\r\nThen, after tea, the wind veers round, and you have to pull hard in its\r\nteeth all the way home.\r\n\r\nWhen you forget to take the sail at all, then the wind is consistently\r\nin your favour both ways. But there! this world is only a probation,\r\nand man was born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.\r\n\r\nThis evening, however, they had evidently made a mistake, and had put\r\nthe wind round at our back instead of in our face. We kept very quiet\r\nabout it, and got the sail up quickly before they found it out, and\r\nthen we spread ourselves about the boat in thoughtful attitudes, and\r\nthe sail bellied out, and strained, and grumbled at the mast, and the\r\nboat flew.\r\n\r\nI steered.\r\n\r\nThere is no more thrilling sensation I know of than sailing. It comes\r\nas near to flying as man has got to yet\xe2\x80\x94except in dreams. The wings of\r\nthe rushing wind seem to be bearing you onward, you know not where.\r\nYou are no longer the slow, plodding, puny thing of clay, creeping\r\ntortuously upon the ground; you are a part of Nature! Your heart is\r\nthrobbing against hers! Her glorious arms are round you, raising you\r\nup against her heart! Your spirit is at one with hers; your limbs\r\ngrow light! The voices of the air are singing to you. The earth seems\r\nfar away and little; and the clouds, so close above your head, are\r\nbrothers, and you stretch your arms to them.\r\n\r\nWe had the river to ourselves, except that, far in the distance,\r\nwe could see a fishing-punt, moored in mid-stream, on which three\r\nfishermen sat; and we skimmed over the water, and passed the wooded\r\nbanks, and no one spoke.\r\n\r\nI was steering.\r\n\r\nAs we drew nearer, we could see that the three men fishing seemed\r\nold and solemn-looking men. They sat on three chairs in the punt,\r\nand watched intently their lines. And the red sunset threw a mystic\r\nlight upon the waters, and tinged with fire the towering woods, and\r\nmade a golden glory of the piled-up clouds. It was an hour of deep\r\nenchantment, of ecstatic hope and longing. The little sail stood out\r\nagainst the purple sky, the gloaming lay around us, wrapping the world\r\nin rainbow shadows; and, behind us, crept the night.\r\n\r\nWe seemed like knights of some old legend, sailing across some mystic\r\nlake into the unknown realm of twilight, unto the great land of the\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nWe did not go into the realm of twilight; we went slap into that punt,\r\nwhere those three old men were fishing. We did not know what had\r\nhappened at first, because the sail shut out the view, but from the\r\nnature of the language that rose up upon the evening air, we gathered\r\nthat we had come into the neighbourhood of human beings, and that they\r\nwere vexed and discontented.\r\n\r\nHarris let the sail down, and then we saw what had happened. We had\r\nknocked those three old gentlemen off their chairs into a general\r\nheap at the bottom of the boat, and they were now slowly and\r\npainfully sorting themselves out from each other, and picking fish\r\noff themselves; and as they worked, they cursed us\xe2\x80\x94not with a common\r\ncursory curse, but with long, carefully-thought-out, comprehensive\r\ncurses, that embraced the whole of our career, and went away into the\r\ndistant future, and included all our relations, and covered everything\r\nconnected with us\xe2\x80\x94good, substantial curses.\r\n\r\nHarris told them they ought to be grateful for a little excitement,\r\nsitting there fishing all day, and he also said that he was shocked and\r\ngrieved to hear men their age give way to temper so.\r\n\r\nBut it did not do any good.\r\n\r\nGeorge said he would steer, after that. He said a mind like mine ought\r\nnot to be expected to give itself away in steering boats\xe2\x80\x94better let a\r\nmere commonplace human being see after that boat, before we jolly well\r\nall got drowned; and he took the lines, and brought us up to Marlow.\r\n\r\nAnd at Marlow we left the boat by the bridge, and went and put up for\r\nthe night at\r\n the \xe2\x80\x9cCrown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                           [Picture: The boat]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarlow.\xe2\x80\x94Bisham Abbey.\xe2\x80\x94The Medmenham Monks.\xe2\x80\x94Montmorency thinks he\r\nwill murder an old Tom cat.\xe2\x80\x94But eventually decides that he will let\r\nit live.\xe2\x80\x94Shameful conduct of a fox terrier at the Civil Service\r\nStores.\xe2\x80\x94Our departure from Marlow.\xe2\x80\x94An imposing procession.\xe2\x80\x94The steam\r\nlaunch, useful receipts for annoying and hindering it.\xe2\x80\x94We decline to\r\ndrink the river.\xe2\x80\x94A peaceful dog.\xe2\x80\x94Strange disappearance of Harris and a\r\npie.\r\n\r\nMarlow is one of the pleasantest river centres I know of. It is a\r\nbustling, lively little town; not very picturesque on the whole, it\r\nis true, but there are many quaint nooks and corners to be found in\r\nit, nevertheless\xe2\x80\x94standing arches in the shattered bridge of Time, over\r\nwhich our fancy travels back to the days when Marlow Manor owned Saxon\r\nAlgar for its lord, ere conquering William seized it to give to Queen\r\nMatilda, ere it passed to the Earls of Warwick or to worldly-wise Lord\r\nPaget, the councillor of four successive sovereigns.\r\n\r\nThere is lovely country round about it, too, if, after boating, you are\r\nfond of a walk, while the river itself is at its best here. Down to\r\nCookham, past the Quarry Woods and the meadows, is a lovely reach. Dear\r\nold Quarry Woods! with your narrow, climbing paths, and little winding\r\nglades, how scented to this hour you seem with memories of sunny summer\r\ndays! How haunted are your shadowy vistas with the ghosts of laughing\r\nfaces! how from your whispering leaves there softly fall the voices of\r\nlong ago!\r\n\r\n[Picture: Bisham Abbey] From Marlow up to Sonning is even fairer yet.\r\nGrand old Bisham Abbey, whose stone walls have rung to the shouts of\r\nthe Knights Templars, and which, at one time, was the home of Anne\r\nof Cleves and at another of Queen Elizabeth, is passed on the right\r\nbank just half a mile above Marlow Bridge. Bisham Abbey is rich in\r\nmelodramatic properties. It contains a tapestry bed-chamber, and a\r\nsecret room hid high up in the thick walls. The ghost of the Lady Holy,\r\nwho beat her little boy to death, still walks there at night, trying to\r\nwash its ghostly hands clean in a ghostly basin.\r\n\r\nWarwick, the king-maker, rests there, careless now about such trivial\r\nthings as earthly kings and earthly kingdoms; and Salisbury, who did\r\ngood service at Poitiers. Just before you come to the abbey, and right\r\non the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank, is Bisham Church, and, perhaps, if any tombs are\r\nworth inspecting, they are the tombs and monuments in Bisham Church. It\r\nwas while floating in his boat under the Bisham beeches that Shelley,\r\nwho was then living at Marlow (you can see his house now, in West\r\nstreet), composed _The Revolt of Islam_.\r\n\r\nBy Hurley Weir, a little higher up, I have often thought that I could\r\nstay a month without having sufficient time to drink in all the beauty\r\nof the scene. The village of Hurley, five minutes\xe2\x80\x99 walk from the lock,\r\nis as old a little spot as there is on the river, dating, as it does,\r\nto quote the quaint phraseology of those dim days, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the times of\r\nKing Sebert and King Offa.\xe2\x80\x9d Just past the weir (going up) is Danes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nField, where the invading Danes once encamped, during their march to\r\nGloucestershire; and a little further still, nestling by a sweet corner\r\nof the stream, is what is left of Medmenham Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe famous Medmenham monks, or \xe2\x80\x9cHell Fire Club,\xe2\x80\x9d as they were\r\ncommonly called, and of whom the notorious Wilkes was a member, were\r\na fraternity whose motto was \xe2\x80\x9cDo as you please,\xe2\x80\x9d and that invitation\r\nstill stands over the ruined doorway of the abbey. Many years before\r\nthis bogus abbey, with its congregation of irreverent jesters, was\r\nfounded, there stood upon this same spot a monastery of a sterner kind,\r\nwhose monks were of a somewhat different type to the revellers that\r\nwere to follow them, five hundred years afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Cistercian monks, whose abbey stood there in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, wore no clothes but rough tunics and cowls, and ate no flesh,\r\nnor fish, nor eggs. They lay upon straw, and they rose at midnight to\r\nmass. They spent the day in labour, reading, and prayer; and over all\r\ntheir lives there fell a silence as of death, for no one spoke.\r\n\r\nA grim fraternity, passing grim lives in that sweet spot, that God had\r\nmade so bright! Strange that Nature\xe2\x80\x99s voices all around them\xe2\x80\x94the soft\r\nsinging of the waters, the whisperings of the river grass, the music of\r\nthe rushing wind\xe2\x80\x94should not have taught them a truer meaning of life\r\nthan this. They listened there, through the long days, in silence,\r\nwaiting for a voice from heaven; and all day long and through the\r\nsolemn night it spoke to them in myriad tones, and they heard it not.\r\n\r\nFrom Medmenham to sweet Hambledon Lock the river is full of peaceful\r\nbeauty, but, after it passes Greenlands, the rather uninteresting\r\nlooking river residence of my newsagent\xe2\x80\x94a quiet unassuming old\r\ngentleman, who may often be met with about these regions, during the\r\nsummer months, sculling himself along in easy vigorous style, or\r\nchatting genially to some old lock-keeper, as he passes through\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nwell the other side of Henley, it is somewhat bare and dull.\r\n\r\nWe got up tolerably early on the Monday morning at Marlow, and went for\r\na bathe before breakfast; and, coming back, Montmorency made an awful\r\nass of himself. The only subject on which Montmorency and I have any\r\nserious difference of opinion is cats. I like cats; Montmorency does\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Cat] When I meet a cat, I say, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Pussy!\xe2\x80\x9d and stop down\r\nand tickle the side of its head; and the cat sticks up its tail in a\r\nrigid, cast-iron manner, arches its back, and wipes its nose up against\r\nmy trousers; and all is gentleness and peace. When Montmorency meets a\r\ncat, the whole street knows about it; and there is enough bad language\r\nwasted in ten seconds to last an ordinarily respectable man all his\r\nlife, with care.\r\n\r\nI do not blame the dog (contenting myself, as a rule, with merely\r\nclouting his head or throwing stones at him), because I take it that\r\nit is his nature. Fox-terriers are born with about four times as much\r\noriginal sin in them as other dogs are, and it will take years and\r\nyears of patient effort on the part of us Christians to bring about any\r\nappreciable reformation in the rowdiness of the fox-terrier nature.\r\n\r\nI remember being in the lobby of the Haymarket Stores one day, and all\r\nround about me were dogs, waiting for the return of their owners, who\r\nwere shopping inside. There were a mastiff, and one or two collies,\r\nand a St. Bernard, a few retrievers and Newfoundlands, a boar-hound, a\r\nFrench poodle, with plenty of hair round its head, but mangy about the\r\nmiddle; a bull-dog, a few Lowther Arcade sort of animals, about the\r\nsize of rats, and a couple of Yorkshire tykes.\r\n\r\nThere they sat, patient, good, and thoughtful. A solemn peacefulness\r\nseemed to reign in that lobby. An air of calmness and resignation\xe2\x80\x94of\r\ngentle sadness pervaded the room.\r\n\r\nThen a sweet young lady entered, leading a meek-looking little\r\nfox-terrier, and left him, chained up there, between the bull-dog and\r\nthe poodle. He sat and looked about him for a minute. Then he cast up\r\nhis eyes to the ceiling, and seemed, judging from his expression, to\r\nbe thinking of his mother. Then he yawned. Then he looked round at the\r\nother dogs, all silent, grave, and dignified.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the bull-dog, sleeping dreamlessly on his right. He looked\r\nat the poodle, erect and haughty, on his left. Then, without a word of\r\nwarning, without the shadow of a provocation, he bit that poodle\xe2\x80\x99s near\r\nfore-leg, and a yelp of agony rang through the quiet shades of that\r\nlobby.\r\n\r\nThe result of his first experiment seemed highly satisfactory to him,\r\nand he determined to go on and make things lively all round. He sprang\r\nover the poodle and vigorously attacked a collie, and the collie woke\r\nup, and immediately commenced a fierce and noisy contest with the\r\npoodle. Then Foxey came back to his own place, and caught the bull-dog\r\nby the ear, and tried to throw him away; and the bull-dog, a curiously\r\nimpartial animal, went for everything he could reach, including the\r\nhall-porter, which gave that dear little terrier the opportunity\r\nto enjoy an uninterrupted fight of his own with an equally willing\r\nYorkshire tyke.\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows canine nature need hardly, be told that, by this\r\ntime, all the other dogs in the place were fighting as if their\r\nhearths and homes depended on the fray. The big dogs fought each other\r\nindiscriminately; and the little dogs fought among themselves, and\r\nfilled up their spare time by biting the legs of the big dogs.\r\n\r\nThe whole lobby was a perfect pandemonium, and the din was terrific. A\r\ncrowd assembled outside in the Haymarket, and asked if it was a vestry\r\nmeeting; or, if not, who was being murdered, and why? Men came with\r\npoles and ropes, and tried to separate the dogs, and the police were\r\nsent for.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of the riot that sweet young lady returned, and\r\nsnatched up that sweet little dog of hers (he had laid the tyke up for\r\na month, and had on the expression, now, of a new-born lamb) into her\r\narms, and kissed him, and asked him if he was killed, and what those\r\ngreat nasty brutes of dogs had been doing to him; and he nestled up\r\nagainst her, and gazed up into her face with a look that seemed to say:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve come to take me away from this disgraceful\r\nscene!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said that the people at the Stores had no right to allow great\r\nsavage things like those other dogs to be put with respectable people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndogs, and that she had a great mind to summon somebody.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of fox-terriers; and, therefore, I do not blame\r\nMontmorency for his tendency to row with cats; but he wished he had not\r\ngiven way to it that morning.\r\n\r\nWe were, as I have said, returning from a dip, and half-way up the High\r\nStreet a cat darted out from one of the houses in front of us, and\r\nbegan to trot across the road. Montmorency gave a cry of joy\xe2\x80\x94the cry of\r\na stern warrior who sees his enemy given over to his hands\xe2\x80\x94the sort of\r\ncry Cromwell might have uttered when the Scots came down the hill\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nflew after his prey.\r\n\r\nHis victim was a large black Tom. I never saw a larger cat, nor a\r\nmore disreputable-looking cat. It had lost half its tail, one of its\r\nears, and a fairly appreciable proportion of its nose. It was a long,\r\nsinewy-looking animal. It had a calm, contented air about it.\r\n\r\nMontmorency went for that poor cat at the rate of twenty miles an hour;\r\nbut the cat did not hurry up\xe2\x80\x94did not seem to have grasped the idea\r\nthat its life was in danger. It trotted quietly on until its would-be\r\nassassin was within a yard of it, and then it turned round and sat down\r\nin the middle of the road, and looked at Montmorency with a gentle,\r\ninquiring expression, that said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! You want me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMontmorency does not lack pluck; but there was something about the look\r\nof that cat that might have chilled the heart of the boldest dog. He\r\nstopped abruptly, and looked back at Tom.\r\n\r\nNeither spoke; but the conversation that one could imagine was clearly\r\nas follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nTHE CAT: \xe2\x80\x9cCan I do anything for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMONTMORENCY: \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no, thanks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE CAT: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you mind speaking, if you really want anything, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMONTMORENCY (_backing down the High Street_): \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no\xe2\x80\x94not at\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94certainly\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you trouble. I\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a mistake. I\r\nthought I knew you. Sorry I disturbed you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE CAT: \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all\xe2\x80\x94quite a pleasure. Sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything,\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMONTMORENCY (_still backing_): \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, thanks\xe2\x80\x94not at all\xe2\x80\x94very kind\r\nof you. Good morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTHE CAT: \xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen the cat rose, and continued his trot; and Montmorency, fitting\r\nwhat he calls his tail carefully into its groove, came back to us, and\r\ntook up an unimportant position in the rear.\r\n\r\nTo this day, if you say the word \xe2\x80\x9cCats!\xe2\x80\x9d to Montmorency, he will\r\nvisibly shrink and look up piteously at you, as if to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe did our marketing after breakfast, and revictualled the boat for\r\nthree days. George said we ought to take vegetables\xe2\x80\x94that it was\r\nunhealthy not to eat vegetables. He said they were easy enough to cook,\r\nand that he would see to that; so we got ten pounds of potatoes, a\r\nbushel of peas, and a few cabbages. We got a beefsteak pie, a couple of\r\ngooseberry tarts, and a leg of mutton from the hotel; and fruit, and\r\ncakes, and bread and butter, and jam, and bacon and eggs, and other\r\nthings we foraged round about the town for.\r\n\r\nOur departure from Marlow I regard as one of our greatest successes.\r\nIt was dignified and impressive, without being ostentatious. We had\r\ninsisted at all the shops we had been to that the things should be sent\r\nwith us then and there. None of your \xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, I will send them off at\r\nonce: the boy will be down there before you are, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d and then fooling\r\nabout on the landing-stage, and going back to the shop twice to have a\r\nrow about them, for us. We waited while the basket was packed, and took\r\nthe boy with us.\r\n\r\nWe went to a good many shops, adopting this principle at each one; and\r\nthe consequence was that, by the time we had finished, we had as fine\r\na collection of boys with baskets following us around as heart could\r\ndesire; and our final march down the middle of the High Street, to the\r\nriver, must have been as imposing a spectacle as Marlow had seen for\r\nmany a long day.\r\n\r\nThe order of the procession was as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                      Montmorency, carrying a stick.\r\n         Two disreputable-looking curs, friends of Montmorency\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n        George, carrying coats and rugs, and smoking a short pipe.\r\n                 Harris, trying to walk with easy grace,\r\n          while carrying a bulged-out Gladstone bag in one hand\r\n                 and a bottle of lime-juice in the other.\r\n                    Greengrocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy and baker\xe2\x80\x99s boy,\r\n                              with baskets.\r\n                  Boots from the hotel, carrying hamper.\r\n                     Confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s boy, with basket.\r\n                        Grocer\xe2\x80\x99s boy, with basket.\r\n                             Long-haired dog.\r\n                     Cheesemonger\xe2\x80\x99s boy, with basket.\r\n                         Odd man carrying a bag.\r\n        Bosom companion of odd man, with his hands in his pockets,\r\n                          smoking a short clay.\r\n                      Fruiterer\xe2\x80\x99s boy, with basket.\r\n             Myself, carrying three hats and a pair of boots,\r\n                and trying to look as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it.\r\n                   Six small boys, and four stray dogs.\r\n\r\nWhen we got down to the landing-stage, the boatman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see, sir; was yours a steam-launch or a house-boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Picture: The bring of the provisions] On our informing him it was a\r\ndouble-sculling skiff, he seemed surprised.\r\n\r\nWe had a good deal of trouble with steam launches that morning. It was\r\njust before the Henley week, and they were going up in large numbers;\r\nsome by themselves, some towing houseboats. I do hate steam launches: I\r\nsuppose every rowing man does. I never see a steam launch but I feel I\r\nshould like to lure it to a lonely part of the river, and there, in the\r\nsilence and the solitude, strangle it.\r\n\r\nThere is a blatant bumptiousness about a steam launch that has the\r\nknack of rousing every evil instinct in my nature, and I yearn for the\r\ngood old days, when you could go about and tell people what you thought\r\nof them with a hatchet and a bow and arrows. The expression on the face\r\nof the man who, with his hands in his pockets, stands by the stern,\r\nsmoking a cigar, is sufficient to excuse a breach of the peace by\r\nitself; and the lordly whistle for you to get out of the way would, I\r\nam confident, ensure a verdict of \xe2\x80\x9cjustifiable homicide\xe2\x80\x9d from any jury\r\nof river men.\r\n\r\nThey used to _have_ to whistle for us to get out of their way. If I\r\nmay do so, without appearing boastful, I think I can honestly say that\r\nour one small boat, during that week, caused more annoyance and delay\r\nand aggravation to the steam launches that we came across than all the\r\nother craft on the river put together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteam launch, coming!\xe2\x80\x9d one of us would cry out, on sighting the enemy\r\nin the distance; and, in an instant, everything was got ready to\r\nreceive her. I would take the lines, and Harris and George would sit\r\ndown beside me, all of us with our backs to the launch, and the boat\r\nwould drift out quietly into mid-stream.\r\n\r\nOn would come the launch, whistling, and on we would go, drifting. At\r\nabout a hundred yards off, she would start whistling like mad, and the\r\npeople would come and lean over the side, and roar at us; but we never\r\nheard them! Harris would be telling us an anecdote about his mother,\r\nand George and I would not have missed a word of it for worlds.\r\n\r\nThen that launch would give one final shriek of a whistle that would\r\nnearly burst the boiler, and she would reverse her engines, and blow\r\noff steam, and swing round and get aground; everyone on board of it\r\nwould rush to the bow and yell at us, and the people on the bank would\r\nstand and shout to us, and all the other passing boats would stop and\r\njoin in, till the whole river for miles up and down was in a state\r\nof frantic commotion. And then Harris would break off in the most\r\ninteresting part of his narrative, and look up with mild surprise, and\r\nsay to George:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, George, bless me, if here isn\xe2\x80\x99t a steam launch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd George would answer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you know, I _thought_ I heard something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUpon which we would get nervous and confused, and not know how to get\r\nthe boat out of the way, and the people in the launch would crowd round\r\nand instruct us:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPull your right\xe2\x80\x94you, you idiot! back with your left. No, not _you_\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nother one\xe2\x80\x94leave the lines alone, can\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94now, both together. NOT\r\n_that_ way. Oh, you\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen they would lower a boat and come to our assistance; and, after\r\nquarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s effort, would get us clean out of their way, so\r\nthat they could go on; and we would thank them so much, and ask them to\r\ngive us a tow. But they never would.\r\n\r\nAnother good way we discovered of irritating the aristocratic type of\r\nsteam launch, was to mistake them for a beanfeast, and ask them if they\r\nwere Messrs. Cubit\xe2\x80\x99s lot or the Bermondsey Good Templars, and could\r\nthey lend us a saucepan.\r\n\r\nOld ladies, not accustomed to the river, are always intensely nervous\r\nof steam launches. I remember going up once from Staines to Windsor\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nstretch of water peculiarly rich in these mechanical monstrosities\xe2\x80\x94with\r\na party containing three ladies of this description. It was very\r\nexciting. At the first glimpse of every steam launch that came in view,\r\nthey insisted on landing and sitting down on the bank until it was out\r\nof sight again. They said they were very sorry, but that they owed it\r\nto their families not to be fool-hardy.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves short of water at Hambledon Lock; so we took our jar\r\nand went up to the lock-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s house to beg for some.\r\n\r\nGeorge was our spokesman. He put on a winning smile, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please could you spare us a little water?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9ctake as much as you want, and\r\nleave the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you so much,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured George, looking about him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x94where\r\ndo you keep it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always in the same place my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d was the stolid reply: \xe2\x80\x9cjust\r\nbehind you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, turning round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless us, where\xe2\x80\x99s your eyes?\xe2\x80\x9d was the man\xe2\x80\x99s comment, as he\r\ntwisted George round and pointed up and down the stream. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenough of it to see, ain\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed George, grasping the idea; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we can\xe2\x80\x99t drink the\r\nriver, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but you can drink _some_ of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhat _I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ drunk for the last fifteen years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge told him that his appearance, after the course, did not seem a\r\nsufficiently good advertisement for the brand; and that he would prefer\r\nit out of a pump.\r\n\r\nWe got some from a cottage a little higher up. I daresay _that_ was\r\nonly river water, if we had known. But we did not know, so it was all\r\nright. What the eye does not see, the stomach does not get upset over.\r\n\r\nWe tried river water once, later on in the season, but it was not a\r\nsuccess. We were coming down stream, and had pulled up to have tea in a\r\nbackwater near Windsor. Our jar was empty, and it was a case of going\r\nwithout our tea or taking water from the river. Harris was for chancing\r\nit. He said it must be all right if we boiled the water. He said that\r\nthe various germs of poison present in the water would be killed by the\r\nboiling. So we filled our kettle with Thames backwater, and boiled it;\r\nand very careful we were to see that it did boil.\r\n\r\nWe had made the tea, and were just settling down comfortably to\r\ndrink it, when George, with his cup half-way to his lips, paused and\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harris and I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that!\xe2\x80\x9d said George, looking westward.\r\n\r\n[Picture: The dog] Harris and I followed his gaze, and saw, coming down\r\ntowards us on the sluggish current, a dog. It was one of the quietest\r\nand peacefullest dogs I have ever seen. I never met a dog who seemed\r\nmore contented\xe2\x80\x94more easy in its mind. It was floating dreamily on its\r\nback, with its four legs stuck up straight into the air. It was what I\r\nshould call a full-bodied dog, with a well-developed chest. On he came,\r\nserene, dignified, and calm, until he was abreast of our boat, and\r\nthere, among the rushes, he eased up, and settled down cosily for the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nGeorge said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any tea, and emptied his cup into the water.\r\nHarris did not feel thirsty, either, and followed suit. I had drunk\r\nhalf mine, but I wished I had not.\r\n\r\nI asked George if he thought I was likely to have typhoid.\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no;\xe2\x80\x9d he thought I had a very good chance indeed of\r\nescaping it. Anyhow, I should know in about a fortnight, whether I had\r\nor had not.\r\n\r\nWe went up the backwater to Wargrave. It is a short cut, leading out\r\nof the right-hand bank about half a mile above Marsh Lock, and is well\r\nworth taking, being a pretty, shady little piece of stream, besides\r\nsaving nearly half a mile of distance.\r\n\r\nOf course, its entrance is studded with posts and chains, and\r\nsurrounded with notice boards, menacing all kinds of torture,\r\nimprisonment, and death to everyone who dares set scull upon its\r\nwaters\xe2\x80\x94I wonder some of these riparian boors don\xe2\x80\x99t claim the air of\r\nthe river and threaten everyone with forty shillings fine who breathes\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94but the posts and chains a little skill will easily avoid; and as\r\nfor the boards, you might, if you have five minutes to spare, and there\r\nis nobody about, take one or two of them down and throw them into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nHalf-way up the backwater, we got out and lunched; and it was during\r\nthis lunch that George and I received rather a trying shock.\r\n\r\nHarris received a shock, too; but I do not think Harris\xe2\x80\x99s shock could\r\nhave been anything like so bad as the shock that George and I had over\r\nthe business.\r\n\r\nYou see, it was in this way: we were sitting in a meadow, about ten\r\nyards from the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, and we had just settled down comfortably\r\nto feed. Harris had the beefsteak pie between his knees, and was\r\ncarving it, and George and I were waiting with our plates ready.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you got a spoon there?\xe2\x80\x9d says Harris; \xe2\x80\x9cI want a spoon to help the\r\ngravy with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hamper was close behind us, and George and I both turned round to\r\nreach one out. We were not five seconds getting it. When we looked\r\nround again, Harris and the pie were gone!\r\n\r\nIt was a wide, open field. There was not a tree or a bit of hedge for\r\nhundreds of yards. He could not have tumbled into the river, because we\r\nwere on the water side of him, and he would have had to climb over us\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nGeorge and I gazed all about. Then we gazed at each other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he been snatched up to heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d hardly have taken the pie too,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\nThere seemed weight in this objection, and we discarded the heavenly\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the truth of the matter is,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested George, descending to\r\nthe commonplace and practicable, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there has been an earthquake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he added, with a touch of sadness in his voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been carving that pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, we turned our eyes once more towards the spot where Harris\r\nand the pie had last been seen on earth; and there, as our blood froze\r\nin our veins and our hair stood up on end, we saw Harris\xe2\x80\x99s head\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnothing but his head\xe2\x80\x94sticking bolt upright among the tall grass, the\r\nface very red, and bearing upon it an expression of great indignation!\r\n\r\nGeorge was the first to recover.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cand tell us whether you are alive or dead\xe2\x80\x94and where\r\nis the rest of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t be a stupid ass!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris\xe2\x80\x99s head. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you did it\r\non purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid what?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed George and I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, put me to sit here\xe2\x80\x94darn silly trick! Here, catch hold of the pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Picture: Rescuing the pie] And out of the middle of the earth, as it\r\nseemed to us, rose the pie\xe2\x80\x94very much mixed up and damaged; and, after\r\nit, scrambled Harris\xe2\x80\x94tumbled, grubby, and wet.\r\n\r\nHe had been sitting, without knowing it, on the very verge of a small\r\ngully, the long grass hiding it from view; and in leaning a little back\r\nhe had shot over, pie and all.\r\n\r\nHe said he had never felt so surprised in all his life, as when he\r\nfirst felt himself going, without being able to conjecture in the\r\nslightest what had happened. He thought at first that the end of the\r\nworld had come.\r\n\r\nHarris believes to this day that George and I planned it all\r\nbeforehand. Thus does unjust suspicion follow even the most blameless\r\nfor, as the poet says, \xe2\x80\x9cWho shall escape calumny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWho, indeed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wargrave.\xe2\x80\x94Waxworks.\xe2\x80\x94Sonning.\xe2\x80\x94Our stew.\xe2\x80\x94Montmorency is\r\n    sarcastic.\xe2\x80\x94Fight between Montmorency and the tea-kettle.\xe2\x80\x94George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n    banjo studies.\xe2\x80\x94Meet with discouragement.\xe2\x80\x94Difficulties in the way of\r\n    the musical amateur.\xe2\x80\x94Learning to play the bagpipes.\xe2\x80\x94Harris feels sad\r\n    after supper.\xe2\x80\x94George and I go for a walk.\xe2\x80\x94Return hungry and\r\n    wet.\xe2\x80\x94There is a strangeness about Harris.\xe2\x80\x94Harris and the swans, a\r\n    remarkable story.\xe2\x80\x94Harris has a troubled night.\r\n\r\nWe caught a breeze, after lunch, which took us gently up past Wargrave\r\nand Shiplake. Mellowed in the drowsy sunlight of a summer\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon,\r\nWargrave, nestling where the river bends, makes a sweet old picture as\r\nyou pass it, and one that lingers long upon the retina of memory.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge and Dragon\xe2\x80\x9d at Wargrave boasts a sign, painted on the one\r\nside by Leslie, R.A., and on the other by Hodgson of that ilk. Leslie\r\nhas depicted the fight; Hodgson has imagined the scene, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the\r\nFight\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94George, the work done, enjoying his pint of beer.\r\n\r\nDay, the author of _Sandford and Merton_, lived and\xe2\x80\x94more credit to the\r\nplace still\xe2\x80\x94was killed at Wargrave. In the church is a memorial to Mrs.\r\nSarah Hill, who bequeathed 1 pound annually, to be divided at Easter,\r\nbetween two boys and two girls who \xe2\x80\x9chave never been undutiful to their\r\nparents; who have never been known to swear or to tell untruths,\r\nto steal, or to break windows.\xe2\x80\x9d Fancy giving up all that for five\r\nshillings a year! It is not worth it.\r\n\r\nIt is rumoured in the town that once, many years ago, a boy appeared\r\nwho really never had done these things\xe2\x80\x94or at all events, which was all\r\nthat was required or could be expected, had never been known to do\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94and thus won the crown of glory. He was exhibited for three weeks\r\nafterwards in the Town Hall, under a glass case.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of the money since no one knows. They say it is always\r\nhanded over to the nearest wax-works show.\r\n\r\nShiplake is a pretty village, but it cannot be seen from the river,\r\nbeing upon the hill. Tennyson was married in Shiplake Church.\r\n\r\nThe river up to Sonning winds in and out through many islands, and\r\nis very placid, hushed, and lonely. Few folk, except at twilight, a\r\npair or two of rustic lovers, walk along its banks. \xe2\x80\x99Arry and Lord\r\nFitznoodle have been left behind at Henley, and dismal, dirty Reading\r\nis not yet reached. It is a part of the river in which to dream of\r\nbygone days, and vanished forms and faces, and things that might have\r\nbeen, but are not, confound them.\r\n\r\nWe got out at Sonning, and went for a walk round the village. It is\r\nthe most fairy-like little nook on the whole river. It is more like\r\na stage village than one built of bricks and mortar. Every house is\r\nsmothered in roses, and now, in early June, they were bursting forth\r\nin clouds of dainty splendour. If you stop at Sonning, put up at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBull,\xe2\x80\x9d behind the church. It is a veritable picture of an old country\r\ninn, with green, square courtyard in front, where, on seats beneath the\r\ntrees, the old men group of an evening to drink their ale and gossip\r\nover village politics; with low, quaint rooms and latticed windows, and\r\nawkward stairs and winding passages.\r\n\r\nWe roamed about sweet Sonning for an hour or so, and then, it being\r\ntoo late to push on past Reading, we decided to go back to one of the\r\nShiplake islands, and put up there for the night. It was still early\r\nwhen we got settled, and George said that, as we had plenty of time, it\r\nwould be a splendid opportunity to try a good, slap-up supper. He said\r\nhe would show us what could be done up the river in the way of cooking,\r\nand suggested that, with the vegetables and the remains of the cold\r\nbeef and general odds and ends, we should make an Irish stew.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a fascinating idea. George gathered wood and made a fire, and\r\nHarris and I started to peel the potatoes. I should never have thought\r\nthat peeling potatoes was such an undertaking. The job turned out to\r\nbe the biggest thing of its kind that I had ever been in. We began\r\ncheerfully, one might almost say skittishly, but our light-heartedness\r\nwas gone by the time the first potato was finished. The more we peeled,\r\nthe more peel there seemed to be left on; by the time we had got all\r\nthe peel off and all the eyes out, there was no potato left\xe2\x80\x94at least\r\nnone worth speaking of. George came and had a look at it\xe2\x80\x94it was about\r\nthe size of a pea-nut. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that won\xe2\x80\x99t do! You\xe2\x80\x99re wasting them. You must scrape them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we scraped them, and that was harder work than peeling. They are\r\nsuch an extraordinary shape, potatoes\xe2\x80\x94all bumps and warts and hollows.\r\nWe worked steadily for five-and-twenty minutes, and did four potatoes.\r\nThen we struck. We said we should require the rest of the evening for\r\nscraping ourselves.\r\n\r\nI never saw such a thing as potato-scraping for making a fellow in a\r\nmess. It seemed difficult to believe that the potato-scrapings in which\r\nHarris and I stood, half smothered, could have come off four potatoes.\r\nIt shows you what can be done with economy and care.\r\n\r\nGeorge said it was absurd to have only four potatoes in an Irish stew,\r\nso we washed half-a-dozen or so more, and put them in without peeling.\r\nWe also put in a cabbage and about half a peck of peas. George stirred\r\nit all up, and then he said that there seemed to be a lot of room to\r\nspare, so we overhauled both the hampers, and picked out all the odds\r\nand ends and the remnants, and added them to the stew. There were half\r\na pork pie and a bit of cold boiled bacon left, and we put them in.\r\nThen George found half a tin of potted salmon, and he emptied that into\r\nthe pot.\r\n\r\nHe said that was the advantage of Irish stew: you got rid of such a lot\r\nof things. I fished out a couple of eggs that had got cracked, and put\r\nthose in. George said they would thicken the gravy.\r\n\r\nI forget the other ingredients, but I know nothing was wasted; and I\r\nremember that, towards the end, Montmorency, who had evinced great\r\ninterest in the proceedings throughout, strolled away with an earnest\r\nand thoughtful air, reappearing, a few minutes afterwards, with a dead\r\nwater-rat in his mouth, which he evidently wished to present as his\r\ncontribution to the dinner; whether in a sarcastic spirit, or with a\r\ngenuine desire to assist, I cannot say.\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion as to whether the rat should go in or not.\r\nHarris said that he thought it would be all right, mixed up with the\r\nother things, and that every little helped; but George stood up for\r\nprecedent. He said he had never heard of water-rats in Irish stew, and\r\nhe would rather be on the safe side, and not try experiments.\r\n\r\nHarris said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you never try a new thing, how can you tell what it\xe2\x80\x99s like? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen such as you that hamper the world\xe2\x80\x99s progress. Think of the man who\r\nfirst tried German sausage!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a great success, that Irish stew. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I ever enjoyed\r\na meal more. There was something so fresh and piquant about it. One\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalate gets so tired of the old hackneyed things: here was a dish with\r\na new flavour, with a taste like nothing else on earth.\r\n\r\nAnd it was nourishing, too. As George said, there was good stuff in\r\nit. The peas and potatoes might have been a bit softer, but we all had\r\ngood teeth, so that did not matter much: and as for the gravy, it was a\r\npoem\xe2\x80\x94a little too rich, perhaps, for a weak stomach, but nutritious.\r\n\r\nWe finished up with tea and cherry tart. Montmorency had a fight with\r\nthe kettle during tea-time, and came off a poor second.\r\n\r\nThroughout the trip, he had manifested great curiosity concerning\r\nthe kettle. He would sit and watch it, as it boiled, with a puzzled\r\nexpression, and would try and rouse it every now and then by growling\r\nat it. When it began to splutter and steam, he regarded it as a\r\nchallenge, and would want to fight it, only, at that precise moment,\r\nsome one would always dash up and bear off his prey before he could get\r\nat it.\r\n\r\nTo-day he determined he would be beforehand. At the first sound\r\nthe kettle made, he rose, growling, and advanced towards it in a\r\nthreatening attitude. It was only a little kettle, but it was full of\r\npluck, and it up and spit at him.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Montmorency and the kettle] \xe2\x80\x9cAh! would ye!\xe2\x80\x9d growled\r\nMontmorency, showing his teeth; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach ye to cheek a hard-working,\r\nrespectable dog; ye miserable, long-nosed, dirty-looking scoundrel, ye.\r\nCome on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he rushed at that poor little kettle, and seized it by the spout.\r\n\r\nThen, across the evening stillness, broke a blood-curdling yelp, and\r\nMontmorency left the boat, and did a constitutional three times round\r\nthe island at the rate of thirty-five miles an hour, stopping every now\r\nand then to bury his nose in a bit of cool mud.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Montmorency regarded the kettle with a mixture of awe,\r\nsuspicion, and hate. Whenever he saw it he would growl and back at a\r\nrapid rate, with his tail shut down, and the moment it was put upon the\r\nstove he would promptly climb out of the boat, and sit on the bank,\r\ntill the whole tea business was over.\r\n\r\nGeorge got out his banjo after supper, and wanted to play it, but\r\nHarris objected: he said he had got a headache, and did not feel strong\r\nenough to stand it. George thought the music might do him good\xe2\x80\x94said\r\nmusic often soothed the nerves and took away a headache; and he twanged\r\ntwo or three notes, just to show Harris what it was like.\r\n\r\nHarris said he would rather have the headache.\r\n\r\nGeorge has never learned to play the banjo to this day. He has had\r\ntoo much all-round discouragement to meet. He tried on two or three\r\nevenings, while we were up the river, to get a little practice, but it\r\nwas never a success. Harris\xe2\x80\x99s language used to be enough to unnerve any\r\nman; added to which, Montmorency would sit and howl steadily, right\r\nthrough the performance. It was not giving the man a fair chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he want to howl like that for when I\xe2\x80\x99m playing?\xe2\x80\x9d George would\r\nexclaim indignantly, while taking aim at him with a boot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to play like that for when he is howling?\xe2\x80\x9d Harris\r\nwould retort, catching the boot. \xe2\x80\x9cYou let him alone. He can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nhowling. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a musical ear, and your playing _makes_ him howl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo George determined to postpone study of the banjo until he reached\r\nhome. But he did not get much opportunity even there. Mrs. P. used\r\nto come up and say she was very sorry\xe2\x80\x94for herself, she liked to hear\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94but the lady upstairs was in a very delicate state, and the doctor\r\nwas afraid it might injure the child.\r\n\r\nThen George tried taking it out with him late at night, and practising\r\nround the square. But the inhabitants complained to the police about\r\nit, and a watch was set for him one night, and he was captured. The\r\nevidence against him was very clear, and he was bound over to keep the\r\npeace for six months.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to lose heart in the business after that. He did make one\r\nor two feeble efforts to take up the work again when the six months\r\nhad elapsed, but there was always the same coldness\xe2\x80\x94the same want of\r\nsympathy on the part of the world to fight against; and, after awhile,\r\nhe despaired altogether, and advertised the instrument for sale at a\r\ngreat sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cowner having no further use for same\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and took to\r\nlearning card tricks instead.\r\n\r\nIt must be disheartening work learning a musical instrument. You would\r\nthink that Society, for its own sake, would do all it could to assist a\r\nman to acquire the art of playing a musical instrument. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n\r\nI knew a young fellow once, who was studying to play the bagpipes, and\r\nyou would be surprised at the amount of opposition he had to contend\r\nwith. Why, not even from the members of his own family did he receive\r\nwhat you could call active encouragement. His father was dead against\r\nthe business from the beginning, and spoke quite unfeelingly on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMy friend used to get up early in the morning to practise, but he\r\nhad to give that plan up, because of his sister. She was somewhat\r\nreligiously inclined, and she said it seemed such an awful thing to\r\nbegin the day like that.\r\n\r\nSo he sat up at night instead, and played after the family had gone to\r\nbed, but that did not do, as it got the house such a bad name. People,\r\ngoing home late, would stop outside to listen, and then put it about\r\nall over the town, the next morning, that a fearful murder had been\r\ncommitted at Mr. Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s the night before; and would describe how\r\nthey had heard the victim\xe2\x80\x99s shrieks and the brutal oaths and curses\r\nof the murderer, followed by the prayer for mercy, and the last dying\r\ngurgle of the corpse.\r\n\r\nSo they let him practise in the day-time, in the back-kitchen with all\r\nthe doors shut; but his more successful passages could generally be\r\nheard in the sitting-room, in spite of these precautions, and would\r\naffect his mother almost to tears.\r\n\r\nShe said it put her in mind of her poor father (he had been swallowed\r\nby a shark, poor man, while bathing off the coast of New Guinea\xe2\x80\x94where\r\nthe connection came in, she could not explain).\r\n\r\nThen they knocked up a little place for him at the bottom of the\r\ngarden, about quarter of a mile from the house, and made him take the\r\nmachine down there when he wanted to work it; and sometimes a visitor\r\nwould come to the house who knew nothing of the matter, and they would\r\nforget to tell him all about it, and caution him, and he would go out\r\nfor a stroll round the garden and suddenly get within earshot of those\r\nbagpipes, without being prepared for it, or knowing what it was. If he\r\nwere a man of strong mind, it only gave him fits; but a person of mere\r\naverage intellect it usually sent mad.\r\n\r\nThere is, it must be confessed, something very sad about the early\r\nefforts of an amateur in bagpipes. I have felt that myself when\r\nlistening to my young friend. They appear to be a trying instrument to\r\nperform upon. You have to get enough breath for the whole tune before\r\nyou start\xe2\x80\x94at least, so I gathered from watching Jefferson.\r\n\r\nHe would begin magnificently with a wild, full, come-to-the-battle sort\r\nof a note, that quite roused you. But he would get more and more piano\r\nas he went on, and the last verse generally collapsed in the middle\r\nwith a splutter and a hiss.\r\n\r\nYou want to be in good health to play the bagpipes.\r\n\r\nYoung Jefferson only learnt to play one tune on those bagpipes;\r\nbut I never heard any complaints about the insufficiency of his\r\nrepertoire\xe2\x80\x94none whatever. This tune was \xe2\x80\x9cThe Campbells are Coming,\r\nHooray\xe2\x80\x94Hooray!\xe2\x80\x9d so he said, though his father always held that it was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Blue Bells of Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9d Nobody seemed quite sure what it was\r\nexactly, but they all agreed that it sounded Scotch.\r\n\r\nStrangers were allowed three guesses, and most of them guessed a\r\ndifferent tune each time.\r\n\r\nHarris was disagreeable after supper,\xe2\x80\x94I think it must have been the\r\nstew that had upset him: he is not used to high living,\xe2\x80\x94so George and\r\nI left him in the boat, and settled to go for a mouch round Henley. He\r\nsaid he should have a glass of whisky and a pipe, and fix things up for\r\nthe night. We were to shout when we returned, and he would row over\r\nfrom the island and fetch us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go to sleep, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d we said as we started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot much fear of that while this stew\xe2\x80\x99s on,\xe2\x80\x9d he grunted, as he pulled\r\nback to the island.\r\n\r\nHenley was getting ready for the regatta, and was full of bustle.\r\nWe met a goodish number of men we knew about the town, and in their\r\npleasant company the time slipped by somewhat quickly; so that it was\r\nnearly eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock before we set off on our four-mile walk home\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nwe had learned to call our little craft by this time.\r\n\r\nIt was a dismal night, coldish, with a thin rain falling; and as we\r\ntrudged through the dark, silent fields, talking low to each other, and\r\nwondering if we were going right or not, we thought of the cosy boat,\r\nwith the bright light streaming through the tight-drawn canvas; of\r\nHarris and Montmorency, and the whisky, and wished that we were there.\r\n\r\nWe conjured up the picture of ourselves inside, tired and a little\r\nhungry; of the gloomy river and the shapeless trees; and, like a giant\r\nglow-worm underneath them, our dear old boat, so snug and warm and\r\ncheerful. We could see ourselves at supper there, pecking away at cold\r\nmeat, and passing each other chunks of bread; we could hear the cheery\r\nclatter of our knives, the laughing voices, filling all the space, and\r\noverflowing through the opening out into the night. And we hurried on\r\nto realise the vision.\r\n\r\nWe struck the tow-path at length, and that made us happy; because\r\nprior to this we had not been sure whether we were walking towards the\r\nriver or away from it, and when you are tired and want to go to bed\r\nuncertainties like that worry you. We passed Skiplake as the clock was\r\nstriking the quarter to twelve; and then George said, thoughtfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to remember which of the islands it was, do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, beginning to grow thoughtful too, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. How many\r\nare there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly four,\xe2\x80\x9d answered George. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be all right, if he\xe2\x80\x99s awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if not?\xe2\x80\x9d I queried; but we dismissed that train of thought.\r\n\r\nWe shouted when we came opposite the first island, but there was no\r\nresponse; so we went to the second, and tried there, and obtained the\r\nsame result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I remember now,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cit was the third one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd we ran on hopefully to the third one, and hallooed.\r\n\r\nNo answer!\r\n\r\nThe case was becoming serious. it was now past midnight. The hotels\r\nat Skiplake and Henley would be crammed; and we could not go round,\r\nknocking up cottagers and householders in the middle of the night, to\r\nknow if they let apartments! George suggested walking back to Henley\r\nand assaulting a policeman, and so getting a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging in the\r\nstation-house. But then there was the thought, \xe2\x80\x9cSuppose he only hits us\r\nback and refuses to lock us up!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe could not pass the whole night fighting policemen. Besides, we did\r\nnot want to overdo the thing and get six months.\r\n\r\nWe despairingly tried what seemed in the darkness to be the fourth\r\nisland, but met with no better success. The rain was coming down fast\r\nnow, and evidently meant to last. We were wet to the skin, and cold and\r\nmiserable. We began to wonder whether there were only four islands or\r\nmore, or whether we were near the islands at all, or whether we were\r\nanywhere within a mile of where we ought to be, or in the wrong part\r\nof the river altogether; everything looked so strange and different in\r\nthe darkness. We began to understand the sufferings of the Babes in the\r\nWood.\r\n\r\nJust when we had given up all hope\xe2\x80\x94yes, I know that is always the\r\ntime that things do happen in novels and tales; but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\r\nI resolved, when I began to write this book, that I would be strictly\r\ntruthful in all things; and so I will be, even if I have to employ\r\nhackneyed phrases for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ just when we had given up all hope, and I must therefore say\r\nso. Just when we had given up all hope, then, I suddenly caught sight,\r\na little way below us, of a strange, weird sort of glimmer flickering\r\namong the trees on the opposite bank. For an instant I thought of\r\nghosts: it was such a shadowy, mysterious light. The next moment it\r\nflashed across me that it was our boat, and I sent up such a yell\r\nacross the water that made the night seem to shake in its bed.\r\n\r\nWe waited breathless for a minute, and then\xe2\x80\x94oh! divinest music of the\r\ndarkness!\xe2\x80\x94we heard the answering bark of Montmorency. We shouted back\r\nloud enough to wake the Seven Sleepers\xe2\x80\x94I never could understand myself\r\nwhy it should take more noise to wake seven sleepers than one\xe2\x80\x94and,\r\nafter what seemed an hour, but what was really, I suppose, about five\r\nminutes, we saw the lighted boat creeping slowly over the blackness,\r\nand heard Harris\xe2\x80\x99s sleepy voice asking where we were.\r\n\r\nThere was an unaccountable strangeness about Harris. It was something\r\nmore than mere ordinary tiredness. He pulled the boat against a part of\r\nthe bank from which it was quite impossible for us to get into it, and\r\nimmediately went to sleep. It took us an immense amount of screaming\r\nand roaring to wake him up again and put some sense into him; but we\r\nsucceeded at last, and got safely on board.\r\n\r\nHarris had a sad expression on him, so we noticed, when we got into the\r\nboat. He gave you the idea of a man who had been through trouble. We\r\nasked him if anything had happened, and he said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n[Picture: Swans] \xe2\x80\x9cSwans!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt seemed we had moored close to a swan\xe2\x80\x99s nest, and, soon after George\r\nand I had gone, the female swan came back, and kicked up a row about\r\nit. Harris had chivied her off, and she had gone away, and fetched up\r\nher old man. Harris said he had had quite a fight with these two swans;\r\nbut courage and skill had prevailed in the end, and he had defeated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHalf-an-hour afterwards they returned with eighteen other swans! It\r\nmust have been a fearful battle, so far as we could understand Harris\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount of it. The swans had tried to drag him and Montmorency out of\r\nthe boat and drown them; and he had defended himself like a hero for\r\nfour hours, and had killed the lot, and they had all paddled away to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many swans did you say there were?\xe2\x80\x9d asked George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThirty-two,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harris, sleepily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said eighteen just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d grunted Harris; \xe2\x80\x9cI said twelve. Think I can\xe2\x80\x99t count?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat were the real facts about these swans we never found out. We\r\nquestioned Harris on the subject in the morning, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nswans?\xe2\x80\x9d and seemed to think that George and I had been dreaming.\r\n\r\nOh, how delightful it was to be safe in the boat, after our trials and\r\nfears! We ate a hearty supper, George and I, and we should have had\r\nsome toddy after it, if we could have found the whisky, but we could\r\nnot. We examined Harris as to what he had done with it; but he did not\r\nseem to know what we meant by \xe2\x80\x9cwhisky,\xe2\x80\x9d or what we were talking about\r\nat all. Montmorency looked as if he knew something, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nI slept well that night, and should have slept better if it had not\r\nbeen for Harris. I have a vague recollection of having been woke up at\r\nleast a dozen times during the night by Harris wandering about the boat\r\nwith the lantern, looking for his clothes. He seemed to be worrying\r\nabout his clothes all night.\r\n\r\nTwice he routed up George and myself to see if we were lying on his\r\ntrousers. George got quite wild the second time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the thunder do you want your trousers for, in the middle of the\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked indignantly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you lie down, and go to sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found him in trouble, the next time I awoke, because he could not\r\nfind his socks; and my last hazy remembrance is of being rolled over on\r\nmy side, and of hearing Harris muttering something about its being an\r\nextraordinary thing where his umbrella could have got to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nHousehold duties.\xe2\x80\x94Love of work.\xe2\x80\x94The old river hand, what he\r\ndoes and what he tells you he has done.\xe2\x80\x94Scepticism of the new\r\ngeneration.\xe2\x80\x94Early boating recollections.\xe2\x80\x94Rafting.\xe2\x80\x94George does the thing\r\nin style.\xe2\x80\x94The old boatman, his method.\xe2\x80\x94So calm, so full of peace.\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nbeginner.\xe2\x80\x94Punting.\xe2\x80\x94A sad accident.\xe2\x80\x94Pleasures of friendship.\xe2\x80\x94Sailing, my\r\nfirst experience.\xe2\x80\x94Possible reason why we were not drowned.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Woman at housework] We woke late the next morning, and,\r\nat Harris\xe2\x80\x99s earnest desire, partook of a plain breakfast, with \xe2\x80\x9cnon\r\ndainties.\xe2\x80\x9d Then we cleaned up, and put everything straight (a continual\r\nlabour, which was beginning to afford me a pretty clear insight into\r\na question that had often posed me\xe2\x80\x94namely, how a woman with the work\r\nof only one house on her hands manages to pass away her time), and, at\r\nabout ten, set out on what we had determined should be a good day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nWe agreed that we would pull this morning, as a change from towing; and\r\nHarris thought the best arrangement would be that George and I should\r\nscull, and he steer. I did not chime in with this idea at all; I said I\r\nthought Harris would have been showing a more proper spirit if he had\r\nsuggested that he and George should work, and let me rest a bit. It\r\nseemed to me that I was doing more than my fair share of the work on\r\nthis trip, and I was beginning to feel strongly on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt always does seem to me that I am doing more work than I should\r\ndo. It is not that I object to the work, mind you; I like work: it\r\nfascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours. I love to keep it by\r\nme: the idea of getting rid of it nearly breaks my heart.\r\n\r\nYou cannot give me too much work; to accumulate work has almost become\r\na passion with me: my study is so full of it now, that there is hardly\r\nan inch of room for any more. I shall have to throw out a wing soon.\r\n\r\nAnd I am careful of my work, too. Why, some of the work that I have by\r\nme now has been in my possession for years and years, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na finger-mark on it. I take a great pride in my work; I take it down\r\nnow and then and dust it. No man keeps his work in a better state of\r\npreservation than I do.\r\n\r\nBut, though I crave for work, I still like to be fair. I do not ask for\r\nmore than my proper share.\r\n\r\nBut I get it without asking for it\xe2\x80\x94at least, so it appears to me\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthis worries me.\r\n\r\nGeorge says he does not think I need trouble myself on the subject. He\r\nthinks it is only my over-scrupulous nature that makes me fear I am\r\nhaving more than my due; and that, as a matter of fact, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nhalf as much as I ought. But I expect he only says this to comfort me.\r\n\r\nIn a boat, I have always noticed that it is the fixed idea of each\r\nmember of the crew that he is doing everything. Harris\xe2\x80\x99s notion was,\r\nthat it was he alone who had been working, and that both George and I\r\nhad been imposing upon him. George, on the other hand, ridiculed the\r\nidea of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s having done anything more than eat and sleep, and had\r\na cast-iron opinion that it was he\xe2\x80\x94George himself\xe2\x80\x94who had done all the\r\nlabour worth speaking of.\r\n\r\nHe said he had never been out with such a couple of lazily skulks as\r\nHarris and I.\r\n\r\nThat amused Harris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy old George talking about work!\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, about\r\nhalf-an-hour of it would kill him. Have you ever seen George work?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, turning to me.\r\n\r\nI agreed with Harris that I never had\xe2\x80\x94most certainly not since we had\r\nstarted on this trip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how _you_ can know much about it, one way or the\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x9d George retorted on Harris; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99m blest if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nasleep half the time. Have you ever seen Harris fully awake, except at\r\nmeal-time?\xe2\x80\x9d asked George, addressing me.\r\n\r\nTruth compelled me to support George. Harris had been very little good\r\nin the boat, so far as helping was concerned, from the beginning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, hang it all, I\xe2\x80\x99ve done more than old J., anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined\r\nHarris.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t very well have done less,\xe2\x80\x9d added George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose J. thinks he is the passenger,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Harris.\r\n\r\nAnd that was their gratitude to me for having brought them and their\r\nwretched old boat all the way up from Kingston, and for having\r\nsuperintended and managed everything for them, and taken care of them,\r\nand slaved for them. It is the way of the world.\r\n\r\nWe settled the present difficulty by arranging that Harris and George\r\nshould scull up past Reading, and that I should tow the boat on from\r\nthere. Pulling a heavy boat against a strong stream has few attractions\r\nfor me now. There was a time, long ago, when I used to clamour for the\r\nhard work: now I like to give the youngsters a chance.\r\n\r\nI notice that most of the old river hands are similarly retiring,\r\nwhenever there is any stiff pulling to be done. You can always tell\r\nthe old river hand by the way in which he stretches himself out upon\r\nthe cushions at the bottom of the boat, and encourages the rowers by\r\ntelling them anecdotes about the marvellous feats he performed last\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing hard work!\xe2\x80\x9d he drawls, between his contented\r\nwhiffs, addressing the two perspiring novices, who have been grinding\r\naway steadily up stream for the last hour and a half; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy, Jim Biffles\r\nand Jack and I, last season, pulled up from Marlow to Goring in one\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x94never stopped once. Do you remember that, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJack, who has made himself a bed up in the prow of all the rugs and\r\ncoats he can collect, and who has been lying there asleep for the last\r\ntwo hours, partially wakes up on being thus appealed to, and recollects\r\nall about the matter, and also remembers that there was an unusually\r\nstrong stream against them all the way\xe2\x80\x94likewise a stiff wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout thirty-four miles, I suppose, it must have been,\xe2\x80\x9d adds the first\r\nspeaker, reaching down another cushion to put under his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94no; don\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerate, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d murmurs Jack, reprovingly;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthirty-three at the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Jack and Tom, quite exhausted by this conversational effort, drop\r\noff to sleep once more. And the two simple-minded youngsters at the\r\nsculls feel quite proud of being allowed to row such wonderful oarsmen\r\nas Jack and Tom, and strain away harder than ever.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young man, I used to listen to these tales from my elders,\r\nand take them in, and swallow them, and digest every word of them,\r\nand then come up for more; but the new generation do not seem to have\r\nthe simple faith of the old times. We\xe2\x80\x94George, Harris, and myself\xe2\x80\x94took\r\na \xe2\x80\x9craw \xe2\x80\x99un\xe2\x80\x9d up with us once last season, and we plied him with the\r\ncustomary stretchers about the wonderful things we had done all the way\r\nup.\r\n\r\nWe gave him all the regular ones\xe2\x80\x94the time-honoured lies that have done\r\nduty up the river with every boating-man for years past\xe2\x80\x94and added seven\r\nentirely original ones that we had invented for ourselves, including\r\na really quite likely story, founded, to a certain extent, on an all\r\nbut true episode, which had actually happened in a modified degree\r\nsome years ago to friends of ours\xe2\x80\x94a story that a mere child could have\r\nbelieved without injuring itself, much.\r\n\r\nAnd that young man mocked at them all, and wanted us to repeat the\r\nfeats then and there, and to bet us ten to one that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nWe got to chatting about our rowing experiences this morning, and to\r\nrecounting stories of our first efforts in the art of oarsmanship.\r\nMy own earliest boating recollection is of five of us contributing\r\nthreepence each and taking out a curiously constructed craft on the\r\nRegent\xe2\x80\x99s Park lake, drying ourselves subsequently, in the park-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlodge.\r\n\r\nAfter that, having acquired a taste for the water, I did a good deal\r\nof rafting in various suburban brickfields\xe2\x80\x94an exercise providing more\r\ninterest and excitement than might be imagined, especially when you are\r\nin the middle of the pond and the proprietor of the materials of which\r\nthe raft is constructed suddenly appears on the bank, with a big stick\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nYour first sensation on seeing this gentleman is that, somehow or\r\nother, you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel equal to company and conversation, and that, if\r\nyou could do so without appearing rude, you would rather avoid meeting\r\nhim; and your object is, therefore, to get off on the opposite side of\r\nthe pond to which he is, and to go home quietly and quickly, pretending\r\nnot to see him. He, on the contrary is yearning to take you by the\r\nhand, and talk to you.\r\n\r\nIt appears that he knows your father, and is intimately acquainted\r\nwith yourself, but this does not draw you towards him. He says he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nteach you to take his boards and make a raft of them; but, seeing\r\nthat you know how to do this pretty well already, the offer, though\r\ndoubtless kindly meant, seems a superfluous one on his part, and you\r\nare reluctant to put him to any trouble by accepting it.\r\n\r\nHis anxiety to meet you, however, is proof against all your coolness,\r\nand the energetic manner in which he dodges up and down the pond so as\r\nto be on the spot to greet you when you land is really quite flattering.\r\n\r\nIf he be of a stout and short-winded build, you can easily avoid his\r\nadvances; but, when he is of the youthful and long-legged type, a\r\nmeeting is inevitable. The interview is, however, extremely brief,\r\nmost of the conversation being on his part, your remarks being mostly\r\nof an exclamatory and mono-syllabic order, and as soon as you can tear\r\nyourself away you do so.\r\n\r\nI devoted some three months to rafting, and, being then as proficient\r\nas there was any need to be at that branch of the art, I determined to\r\ngo in for rowing proper, and joined one of the Lea boating clubs.\r\n\r\nBeing out in a boat on the river Lea, especially on Saturday\r\nafternoons, soon makes you smart at handling a craft, and spry at\r\nescaping being run down by roughs or swamped by barges; and it also\r\naffords plenty of opportunity for acquiring the most prompt and\r\ngraceful method of lying down flat at the bottom of the boat so as to\r\navoid being chucked out into the river by passing tow-lines.\r\n\r\nBut it does not give you style. It was not till I came to the Thames\r\nthat I got style. My style of rowing is very much admired now. People\r\nsay it is so quaint.\r\n\r\nGeorge never went near the water until he was sixteen. Then he and\r\neight other gentlemen of about the same age went down in a body to Kew\r\none Saturday, with the idea of hiring a boat there, and pulling to\r\nRichmond and back; one of their number, a shock-headed youth, named\r\nJoskins, who had once or twice taken out a boat on the Serpentine, told\r\nthem it was jolly fun, boating!\r\n\r\nThe tide was running out pretty rapidly when they reached the\r\nlanding-stage, and there was a stiff breeze blowing across the river,\r\nbut this did not trouble them at all, and they proceeded to select\r\ntheir boat.\r\n\r\nThere was an eight-oared racing outrigger drawn up on the stage; that\r\nwas the one that took their fancy. They said they\xe2\x80\x99d have that one,\r\nplease. The boatman was away, and only his boy was in charge. The boy\r\ntried to damp their ardour for the outrigger, and showed them two or\r\nthree very comfortable-looking boats of the family-party build, but\r\nthose would not do at all; the outrigger was the boat they thought they\r\nwould look best in.\r\n\r\nSo the boy launched it, and they took off their coats and prepared to\r\ntake their seats. The boy suggested that George, who, even in those\r\ndays, was always the heavy man of any party, should be number four.\r\nGeorge said he should be happy to be number four, and promptly stepped\r\ninto bow\xe2\x80\x99s place, and sat down with his back to the stern. They got him\r\ninto his proper position at last, and then the others followed.\r\n\r\nA particularly nervous boy was appointed cox, and the steering\r\nprinciple explained to him by Joskins. Joskins himself took stroke. He\r\ntold the others that it was simple enough; all they had to do was to\r\nfollow him.\r\n\r\nThey said they were ready, and the boy on the landing stage took a\r\nboat-hook and shoved him off.\r\n\r\nWhat then followed George is unable to describe in detail. He has a\r\nconfused recollection of having, immediately on starting, received\r\na violent blow in the small of the back from the butt-end of number\r\nfive\xe2\x80\x99s scull, at the same time that his own seat seemed to disappear\r\nfrom under him by magic, and leave him sitting on the boards. He also\r\nnoticed, as a curious circumstance, that number two was at the same\r\ninstant lying on his back at the bottom of the boat, with his legs in\r\nthe air, apparently in a fit.\r\n\r\nThey passed under Kew Bridge, broadside, at the rate of eight miles an\r\nhour. Joskins being the only one who was rowing. George, on recovering\r\nhis seat, tried to help him, but, on dipping his oar into the water, it\r\nimmediately, to his intense surprise, disappeared under the boat, and\r\nnearly took him with it.\r\n\r\nAnd then \xe2\x80\x9ccox\xe2\x80\x9d threw both rudder lines over-board, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\nHow they got back George never knew, but it took them just forty\r\nminutes. A dense crowd watched the entertainment from Kew Bridge with\r\nmuch interest, and everybody shouted out to them different directions.\r\nThree times they managed to get the boat back through the arch, and\r\nthree times they were carried under it again, and every time \xe2\x80\x9ccox\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nlooked up and saw the bridge above him he broke out into renewed sobs.\r\n\r\nGeorge said he little thought that afternoon that he should ever come\r\nto really like boating.\r\n\r\nHarris is more accustomed to sea rowing than to river work, and says\r\nthat, as an exercise, he prefers it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I remember taking a small\r\nboat out at Eastbourne last summer: I used to do a good deal of sea\r\nrowing years ago, and I thought I should be all right; but I found I\r\nhad forgotten the art entirely. When one scull was deep down underneath\r\nthe water, the other would be flourishing wildly about in the air. To\r\nget a grip of the water with both at the same time I had to stand up.\r\nThe parade was crowded with nobility and gentry, and I had to pull past\r\nthem in this ridiculous fashion. I landed half-way down the beach, and\r\nsecured the services of an old boatman to take me back.\r\n\r\nI like to watch an old boatman rowing, especially one who has been\r\nhired by the hour. There is something so beautifully calm and restful\r\nabout his method. It is so free from that fretful haste, that\r\nvehement striving, that is every day becoming more and more the bane\r\nof nineteenth-century life. He is not for ever straining himself to\r\npass all the other boats. If another boat overtakes him and passes\r\nhim it does not annoy him; as a matter of fact, they all do overtake\r\nhim and pass him\xe2\x80\x94all those that are going his way. This would trouble\r\nand irritate some people; the sublime equanimity of the hired boatman\r\nunder the ordeal affords us a beautiful lesson against ambition and\r\nuppishness.\r\n\r\nPlain practical rowing of the get-the-boat-along order is not a very\r\ndifficult art to acquire, but it takes a good deal of practice before\r\na man feels comfortable, when rowing past girls. It is the \xe2\x80\x9ctime\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\nworries a youngster. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s jolly funny,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, as for the twentieth\r\ntime within five minutes he disentangles his sculls from yours; \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nget on all right when I\xe2\x80\x99m by myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo see two novices try to keep time with one another is very amusing.\r\nBow finds it impossible to keep pace with stroke, because stroke rows\r\nin such an extraordinary fashion. Stroke is intensely indignant at\r\nthis, and explains that what he has been endeavouring to do for the\r\nlast ten minutes is to adapt his method to bow\xe2\x80\x99s limited capacity. Bow,\r\nin turn, then becomes insulted, and requests stroke not to trouble his\r\nhead about him (bow), but to devote his mind to setting a sensible\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Two novices in a boat]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr, shall _I_ take stroke?\xe2\x80\x9d he adds, with the evident idea that that\r\nwould at once put the whole matter right.\r\n\r\nThey splash along for another hundred yards with still moderate\r\nsuccess, and then the whole secret of their trouble bursts upon stroke\r\nlike a flash of inspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what it is: you\xe2\x80\x99ve got my sculls,\xe2\x80\x9d he cries, turning to\r\nbow; \xe2\x80\x9cpass yours over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wondering how it was I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get on\r\nwith these,\xe2\x80\x9d answers bow, quite brightening up, and most willingly\r\nassisting in the exchange. \xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ we shall be all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they are not\xe2\x80\x94not even then. Stroke has to stretch his arms nearly\r\nout of their sockets to reach his sculls now; while bow\xe2\x80\x99s pair, at each\r\nrecovery, hit him a violent blow in the chest. So they change back\r\nagain, and come to the conclusion that the man has given them the wrong\r\nset altogether; and over their mutual abuse of this man they become\r\nquite friendly and sympathetic.\r\n\r\nGeorge said he had often longed to take to punting for a change.\r\nPunting is not as easy as it looks. As in rowing, you soon learn how\r\nto get along and handle the craft, but it takes long practice before\r\nyou can do this with dignity and without getting the water all up your\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\nOne young man I knew had a very sad accident happen to him the first\r\ntime he went punting. He had been getting on so well that he had grown\r\nquite cheeky over the business, and was walking up and down the punt,\r\nworking his pole with a careless grace that was quite fascinating to\r\nwatch. Up he would march to the head of the punt, plant his pole, and\r\nthen run along right to the other end, just like an old punter. Oh! it\r\nwas grand.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Man and pole] And it would all have gone on being grand if he\r\nhad not unfortunately, while looking round to enjoy the scenery, taken\r\njust one step more than there was any necessity for, and walked off\r\nthe punt altogether. The pole was firmly fixed in the mud, and he was\r\nleft clinging to it while the punt drifted away. It was an undignified\r\nposition for him. A rude boy on the bank immediately yelled out to a\r\nlagging chum to \xe2\x80\x9churry up and see a real monkey on a stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not go to his assistance, because, as ill-luck would have it,\r\nwe had not taken the proper precaution to bring out a spare pole with\r\nus. I could only sit and look at him. His expression as the pole slowly\r\nsank with him I shall never forget; there was so much thought in it.\r\n\r\nI watched him gently let down into the water, and saw him scramble out,\r\nsad and wet. I could not help laughing, he looked such a ridiculous\r\nfigure. I continued to chuckle to myself about it for some time, and\r\nthen it was suddenly forced in upon me that really I had got very\r\nlittle to laugh at when I came to think of it. Here was I, alone in\r\na punt, without a pole, drifting helplessly down mid-stream\xe2\x80\x94possibly\r\ntowards a weir.\r\n\r\nI began to feel very indignant with my friend for having stepped\r\noverboard and gone off in that way. He might, at all events, have left\r\nme the pole.\r\n\r\nI drifted on for about a quarter of a mile, and then I came in sight of\r\na fishing-punt moored in mid-stream, in which sat two old fishermen.\r\nThey saw me bearing down upon them, and they called out to me to keep\r\nout of their way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t try,\xe2\x80\x9d they answered.\r\n\r\nI explained the matter to them when I got nearer, and they caught me\r\nand lent me a pole. The weir was just fifty yards below. I am glad they\r\nhappened to be there.\r\n\r\nThe first time I went punting was in company with three other fellows;\r\nthey were going to show me how to do it. We could not all start\r\ntogether, so I said I would go down first and get out the punt, and\r\nthen I could potter about and practice a bit until they came.\r\n\r\nI could not get a punt out that afternoon, they were all engaged; so I\r\nhad nothing else to do but to sit down on the bank, watching the river,\r\nand waiting for my friends.\r\n\r\nI had not been sitting there long before my attention became attracted\r\nto a man in a punt who, I noticed with some surprise, wore a jacket\r\nand cap exactly like mine. He was evidently a novice at punting, and\r\nhis performance was most interesting. You never knew what was going\r\nto happen when he put the pole in; he evidently did not know himself.\r\nSometimes he shot up stream and sometimes he shot down stream, and at\r\nother times he simply spun round and came up the other side of the\r\npole. And with every result he seemed equally surprised and annoyed.\r\n\r\nThe people about the river began to get quite absorbed in him after\r\na while, and to make bets with one another as to what would be the\r\noutcome of his next push.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time my friends arrived on the opposite bank, and\r\nthey stopped and watched him too. His back was towards them, and they\r\nonly saw his jacket and cap. From this they immediately jumped to the\r\nconclusion that it was I, their beloved companion, who was making an\r\nexhibition of himself, and their delight knew no bounds. They commenced\r\nto chaff him unmercifully.\r\n\r\nI did not grasp their mistake at first, and I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cHow rude of\r\nthem to go on like that, with a perfect stranger, too!\xe2\x80\x9d But before I\r\ncould call out and reprove them, the explanation of the matter occurred\r\nto me, and I withdrew behind a tree.\r\n\r\nOh, how they enjoyed themselves, ridiculing that young man! For five\r\ngood minutes they stood there, shouting ribaldry at him, deriding him,\r\nmocking him, jeering at him. They peppered him with stale jokes, they\r\neven made a few new ones and threw at him. They hurled at him all the\r\nprivate family jokes belonging to our set, and which must have been\r\nperfectly unintelligible to him. And then, unable to stand their brutal\r\njibes any longer, he turned round on them, and they saw his face!\r\n\r\nI was glad to notice that they had sufficient decency left in them to\r\nlook very foolish. They explained to him that they had thought he was\r\nsome one they knew. They said they hoped he would not deem them capable\r\nof so insulting any one except a personal friend of their own.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Bathing] Of course their having mistaken him for a friend\r\nexcused it. I remember Harris telling me once of a bathing experience\r\nhe had at Boulogne. He was swimming about there near the beach, when\r\nhe felt himself suddenly seized by the neck from behind, and forcibly\r\nplunged under water. He struggled violently, but whoever had got hold\r\nof him seemed to be a perfect Hercules in strength, and all his efforts\r\nto escape were unavailing. He had given up kicking, and was trying to\r\nturn his thoughts upon solemn things, when his captor released him.\r\n\r\nHe regained his feet, and looked round for his would-be murderer. The\r\nassassin was standing close by him, laughing heartily, but the moment\r\nhe caught sight of Harris\xe2\x80\x99s face, as it emerged from the water, he\r\nstarted back and seemed quite concerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really beg your pardon,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered confusedly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I took you\r\nfor a friend of mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHarris thought it was lucky for him the man had not mistaken him for a\r\nrelation, or he would probably have been drowned outright.\r\n\r\nSailing is a thing that wants knowledge and practice too\xe2\x80\x94though, as a\r\nboy, I did not think so. I had an idea it came natural to a body, like\r\nrounders and touch. I knew another boy who held this view likewise, and\r\nso, one windy day, we thought we would try the sport. We were stopping\r\ndown at Yarmouth, and we decided we would go for a trip up the Yare. We\r\nhired a sailing boat at the yard by the bridge, and started off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather a rough day,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man to us, as we put off: \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\r\ntake in a reef and luff sharp when you get round the bend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe said we would make a point of it, and left him with a cheery\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-morning,\xe2\x80\x9d wondering to ourselves how you \xe2\x80\x9cluffed,\xe2\x80\x9d and where we\r\nwere to get a \xe2\x80\x9creef\xe2\x80\x9d from, and what we were to do with it when we had\r\ngot it.\r\n\r\nWe rowed until we were out of sight of the town, and then, with a\r\nwide stretch of water in front of us, and the wind blowing a perfect\r\nhurricane across it, we felt that the time had come to commence\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nHector\xe2\x80\x94I think that was his name\xe2\x80\x94went on pulling while I unrolled the\r\nsail. It seemed a complicated job, but I accomplished it at length, and\r\nthen came the question, which was the top end?\r\n\r\nBy a sort of natural instinct, we, of course, eventually decided that\r\nthe bottom was the top, and set to work to fix it upside-down. But\r\nit was a long time before we could get it up, either that way or any\r\nother way. The impression on the mind of the sail seemed to be that we\r\nwere playing at funerals, and that I was the corpse and itself was the\r\nwinding-sheet.\r\n\r\nWhen it found that this was not the idea, it hit me over the head with\r\nthe boom, and refused to do anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWet it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hector; \xe2\x80\x9cdrop it over and get it wet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said people in ships always wetted the sails before they put them\r\nup. So I wetted it; but that only made matters worse than they were\r\nbefore. A dry sail clinging to your legs and wrapping itself round your\r\nhead is not pleasant, but, when the sail is sopping wet, it becomes\r\nquite vexing.\r\n\r\nWe did get the thing up at last, the two of us together. We fixed it,\r\nnot exactly upside down\xe2\x80\x94more sideways like\xe2\x80\x94and we tied it up to the\r\nmast with the painter, which we cut off for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThat the boat did not upset I simply state as a fact. Why it did not\r\nupset I am unable to offer any reason. I have often thought about\r\nthe matter since, but I have never succeeded in arriving at any\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nPossibly the result may have been brought about by the natural\r\nobstinacy of all things in this world. The boat may possibly have come\r\nto the conclusion, judging from a cursory view of our behaviour, that\r\nwe had come out for a morning\xe2\x80\x99s suicide, and had thereupon determined\r\nto disappoint us. That is the only suggestion I can offer.\r\n\r\nBy clinging like grim death to the gunwale, we just managed to keep\r\ninside the boat, but it was exhausting work. Hector said that pirates\r\nand other seafaring people generally lashed the rudder to something\r\nor other, and hauled in the main top-jib, during severe squalls, and\r\nthought we ought to try to do something of the kind; but I was for\r\nletting her have her head to the wind.\r\n\r\nAs my advice was by far the easiest to follow, we ended by adopting it,\r\nand contrived to embrace the gunwale and give her her head.\r\n\r\nThe boat travelled up stream for about a mile at a pace I have never\r\nsailed at since, and don\xe2\x80\x99t want to again. Then, at a bend, she heeled\r\nover till half her sail was under water. Then she righted herself by a\r\nmiracle and flew for a long low bank of soft mud.\r\n\r\nThat mud-bank saved us. The boat ploughed its way into the middle of it\r\nand then stuck. Finding that we were once more able to move according\r\nto our ideas, instead of being pitched and thrown about like peas in a\r\nbladder, we crept forward, and cut down the sail.\r\n\r\nWe had had enough sailing. We did not want to overdo the thing and\r\nget a surfeit of it. We had had a sail\xe2\x80\x94a good all-round exciting,\r\ninteresting sail\xe2\x80\x94and now we thought we would have a row, just for a\r\nchange like.\r\n\r\nWe took the sculls and tried to push the boat off the mud, and, in\r\ndoing so, we broke one of the sculls. After that we proceeded with\r\ngreat caution, but they were a wretched old pair, and the second one\r\ncracked almost easier than the first, and left us helpless.\r\n\r\nThe mud stretched out for about a hundred yards in front of us, and\r\nbehind us was the water. The only thing to be done was to sit and wait\r\nuntil someone came by.\r\n\r\nIt was not the sort of day to attract people out on the river, and it\r\nwas three hours before a soul came in sight. It was an old fisherman\r\nwho, with immense difficulty, at last rescued us, and we were towed\r\nback in an ignominious fashion to the boat-yard.\r\n\r\nWhat between tipping the man who had brought us home, and paying for\r\nthe broken sculls, and for having been out four hours and a half, it\r\ncost us a pretty considerable number of weeks\xe2\x80\x99 pocket-money, that sail.\r\nBut we learned experience, and they say that is always cheap at any\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nReading.\xe2\x80\x94We are towed by steam launch.\xe2\x80\x94Irritating behaviour of small\r\nboats.\xe2\x80\x94How they get in the way of steam launches.\xe2\x80\x94George and Harris\r\nagain shirk their work.\xe2\x80\x94Rather a hackneyed story.\xe2\x80\x94Streatley and Goring.\r\n\r\nWe came in sight of Reading about eleven. The river is dirty and\r\ndismal here. One does not linger in the neighbourhood of Reading.\r\nThe town itself is a famous old place, dating from the dim days of\r\nKing Ethelred, when the Danes anchored their warships in the Kennet,\r\nand started from Reading to ravage all the land of Wessex; and here\r\nEthelred and his brother Alfred fought and defeated them, Ethelred\r\ndoing the praying and Alfred the fighting.\r\n\r\nIn later years, Reading seems to have been regarded as a handy place\r\nto run down to, when matters were becoming unpleasant in London.\r\nParliament generally rushed off to Reading whenever there was a plague\r\non at Westminster; and, in 1625, the Law followed suit, and all the\r\ncourts were held at Reading. It must have been worth while having a\r\nmere ordinary plague now and then in London to get rid of both the\r\nlawyers and the Parliament.\r\n\r\nDuring the Parliamentary struggle, Reading was besieged by the Earl of\r\nEssex, and, a quarter of a century later, the Prince of Orange routed\r\nKing James\xe2\x80\x99s troops there.\r\n\r\nHenry I. lies buried at Reading, in the Benedictine abbey founded by\r\nhim there, the ruins of which may still be seen; and, in this same\r\nabbey, great John of Gaunt was married to the Lady Blanche.\r\n\r\nAt Reading lock we came up with a steam launch, belonging to some\r\nfriends of mine, and they towed us up to within about a mile of\r\nStreatley. It is very delightful being towed up by a launch. I prefer\r\nit myself to rowing. The run would have been more delightful still, if\r\nit had not been for a lot of wretched small boats that were continually\r\ngetting in the way of our launch, and, to avoid running down which, we\r\nhad to be continually easing and stopping. It is really most annoying,\r\nthe manner in which these rowing boats get in the way of one\xe2\x80\x99s launch\r\nup the river; something ought to done to stop it.\r\n\r\nAnd they are so confoundedly impertinent, too, over it. You can whistle\r\ntill you nearly burst your boiler before they will trouble themselves\r\nto hurry. I would have one or two of them run down now and then, if I\r\nhad my way, just to teach them all a lesson.\r\n\r\nThe river becomes very lovely from a little above Reading. The railway\r\nrather spoils it near Tilehurst, but from Mapledurham up to Streatley\r\nit is glorious. A little above Mapledurham lock you pass Hardwick\r\nHouse, where Charles I. played bowls. The neighbourhood of Pangbourne,\r\nwhere the quaint little Swan Inn stands, must be as familiar to the\r\n_habitues_ of the Art Exhibitions as it is to its own inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMy friends\xe2\x80\x99 launch cast us loose just below the grotto, and then Harris\r\nwanted to make out that it was my turn to pull. This seemed to me most\r\nunreasonable. It had been arranged in the morning that I should bring\r\nthe boat up to three miles above Reading. Well, here we were, ten miles\r\nabove Reading! Surely it was now their turn again.\r\n\r\nI could not get either George or Harris to see the matter in its proper\r\nlight, however; so, to save argument, I took the sculls. I had not been\r\npulling for more than a minute or so, when George noticed something\r\nblack floating on the water, and we drew up to it. George leant over,\r\nas we neared it, and laid hold of it. And then he drew back with a cry,\r\nand a blanched face.\r\n\r\nIt was the dead body of a woman. It lay very lightly on the water, and\r\nthe face was sweet and calm. It was not a beautiful face; it was too\r\nprematurely aged-looking, too thin and drawn, to be that; but it was a\r\ngentle, lovable face, in spite of its stamp of pinch and poverty, and\r\nupon it was that look of restful peace that comes to the faces of the\r\nsick sometimes when at last the pain has left them.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us\xe2\x80\x94we having no desire to be kept hanging about\r\ncoroners\xe2\x80\x99 courts\xe2\x80\x94some men on the bank had seen the body too, and now\r\ntook charge of it from us.\r\n\r\nWe found out the woman\xe2\x80\x99s story afterwards. Of course it was the old,\r\nold vulgar tragedy. She had loved and been deceived\xe2\x80\x94or had deceived\r\nherself. Anyhow, she had sinned\xe2\x80\x94some of us do now and then\xe2\x80\x94and her\r\nfamily and friends, naturally shocked and indignant, had closed their\r\ndoors against her.\r\n\r\nLeft to fight the world alone, with the millstone of her shame around\r\nher neck, she had sunk ever lower and lower. For a while she had kept\r\nboth herself and the child on the twelve shillings a week that twelve\r\nhours\xe2\x80\x99 drudgery a day procured her, paying six shillings out of it for\r\nthe child, and keeping her own body and soul together on the remainder.\r\n\r\nSix shillings a week does not keep body and soul together very\r\nunitedly. They want to get away from each other when there is only\r\nsuch a very slight bond as that between them; and one day, I suppose,\r\nthe pain and the dull monotony of it all had stood before her eyes\r\nplainer than usual, and the mocking spectre had frightened her. She had\r\nmade one last appeal to friends, but, against the chill wall of their\r\nrespectability, the voice of the erring outcast fell unheeded; and then\r\nshe had gone to see her child\xe2\x80\x94had held it in her arms and kissed it, in\r\na weary, dull sort of way, and without betraying any particular emotion\r\nof any kind, and had left it, after putting into its hand a penny box\r\nof chocolate she had bought it, and afterwards, with her last few\r\nshillings, had taken a ticket and come down to Goring.\r\n\r\n                      [Picture: Woman in the water]\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the bitterest thoughts of her life must have centred\r\nabout the wooded reaches and the bright green meadows around Goring;\r\nbut women strangely hug the knife that stabs them, and, perhaps, amidst\r\nthe gall, there may have mingled also sunny memories of sweetest hours,\r\nspent upon those shadowed deeps over which the great trees bend their\r\nbranches down so low.\r\n\r\nShe had wandered about the woods by the river\xe2\x80\x99s brink all day, and\r\nthen, when evening fell and the grey twilight spread its dusky robe\r\nupon the waters, she stretched her arms out to the silent river that\r\nhad known her sorrow and her joy. And the old river had taken her into\r\nits gentle arms, and had laid her weary head upon its bosom, and had\r\nhushed away the pain.\r\n\r\nThus had she sinned in all things\xe2\x80\x94sinned in living and in dying. God\r\nhelp her! and all other sinners, if any more there be.\r\n\r\nGoring on the left bank and Streatley on the right are both or\r\neither charming places to stay at for a few days. The reaches down\r\nto Pangbourne woo one for a sunny sail or for a moonlight row, and\r\nthe country round about is full of beauty. We had intended to push\r\non to Wallingford that day, but the sweet smiling face of the river\r\nhere lured us to linger for a while; and so we left our boat at the\r\nbridge, and went up into Streatley, and lunched at the \xe2\x80\x9cBull,\xe2\x80\x9d much to\r\nMontmorency\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThey say that the hills on each ride of the stream here once joined\r\nand formed a barrier across what is now the Thames, and that then the\r\nriver ended there above Goring in one vast lake. I am not in a position\r\neither to contradict or affirm this statement. I simply offer it.\r\n\r\nIt is an ancient place, Streatley, dating back, like most river-side\r\ntowns and villages, to British and Saxon times. Goring is not nearly so\r\npretty a little spot to stop at as Streatley, if you have your choice;\r\nbut it is passing fair enough in its way, and is nearer the railway in\r\ncase you want to slip off without paying your hotel bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWashing day.\xe2\x80\x94Fish and fishers.\xe2\x80\x94On the art of angling.\xe2\x80\x94A conscientious\r\nfly-fisher.\xe2\x80\x94A fishy story.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Washing line] We stayed two days at Streatley, and got our\r\nclothes washed. We had tried washing them ourselves, in the river,\r\nunder George\xe2\x80\x99s superintendence, and it had been a failure. Indeed, it\r\nhad been more than a failure, because we were worse off after we had\r\nwashed our clothes than we were before. Before we had washed them, they\r\nhad been very, very dirty, it is true; but they were just wearable.\r\n_After_ we had washed them\xe2\x80\x94well, the river between Reading and Henley\r\nwas much cleaner, after we had washed our clothes in it, than it was\r\nbefore. All the dirt contained in the river between Reading and Henley,\r\nwe collected, during that wash, and worked it into our clothes.\r\n\r\nThe washerwoman at Streatley said she felt she owed it to herself to\r\ncharge us just three times the usual prices for that wash. She said it\r\nhad not been like washing, it had been more in the nature of excavating.\r\n\r\nWe paid the bill without a murmur.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Streatley and Goring is a great fishing centre.\r\nThere is some excellent fishing to be had here. The river abounds in\r\npike, roach, dace, gudgeon, and eels, just here; and you can sit and\r\nfish for them all day.\r\n\r\nSome people do. They never catch them. I never knew anybody catch\r\nanything, up the Thames, except minnows and dead cats, but that has\r\nnothing to do, of course, with fishing! The local fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s guide\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word about catching anything. All it says is the place\r\nis \xe2\x80\x9ca good station for fishing;\xe2\x80\x9d and, from what I have seen of the\r\ndistrict, I am quite prepared to bear out this statement.\r\n\r\nThere is no spot in the world where you can get more fishing, or where\r\nyou can fish for a longer period. Some fishermen come here and fish for\r\na day, and others stop and fish for a month. You can hang on and fish\r\nfor a year, if you want to: it will be all the same.\r\n\r\nThe _Angler\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Thames_ says that \xe2\x80\x9cjack and perch are also\r\nto be had about here,\xe2\x80\x9d but there the _Angler\xe2\x80\x99s Guide_ is wrong. Jack\r\nand perch may _be_ about there. Indeed, I know for a fact that they\r\nare. You can _see_ them there in shoals, when you are out for a walk\r\nalong the banks: they come and stand half out of the water with their\r\nmouths open for biscuits. And, if you go for a bathe, they crowd round,\r\nand get in your way, and irritate you. But they are not to be \xe2\x80\x9chad\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\na bit of worm on the end of a hook, nor anything like it\xe2\x80\x94not they!\r\n\r\nI am not a good fisherman myself. I devoted a considerable amount of\r\nattention to the subject at one time, and was getting on, as I thought,\r\nfairly well; but the old hands told me that I should never be any real\r\ngood at it, and advised me to give it up. They said that I was an\r\nextremely neat thrower, and that I seemed to have plenty of gumption\r\nfor the thing, and quite enough constitutional laziness. But they\r\nwere sure I should never make anything of a fisherman. I had not got\r\nsufficient imagination.\r\n\r\nThey said that as a poet, or a shilling shocker, or a reporter, or\r\nanything of that kind, I might be satisfactory, but that, to gain any\r\nposition as a Thames angler, would require more play of fancy, more\r\npower of invention than I appeared to possess.\r\n\r\nSome people are under the impression that all that is required to\r\nmake a good fisherman is the ability to tell lies easily and without\r\nblushing; but this is a mistake. Mere bald fabrication is useless;\r\nthe veriest tyro can manage that. It is in the circumstantial\r\ndetail, the embellishing touches of probability, the general air of\r\nscrupulous\xe2\x80\x94almost of pedantic\xe2\x80\x94veracity, that the experienced angler is\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nAnybody can come in and say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I caught fifteen dozen perch\r\nyesterday evening;\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLast Monday I landed a gudgeon, weighing\r\neighteen pounds, and measuring three feet from the tip to the tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is no art, no skill, required for that sort of thing. It shows\r\npluck, but that is all.\r\n\r\nNo; your accomplished angler would scorn to tell a lie, that way. His\r\nmethod is a study in itself.\r\n\r\nHe comes in quietly with his hat on, appropriates the most comfortable\r\nchair, lights his pipe, and commences to puff in silence. He lets the\r\nyoungsters brag away for a while, and then, during a momentary lull, he\r\nremoves the pipe from his mouth, and remarks, as he knocks the ashes\r\nout against the bars:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I had a haul on Tuesday evening that it\xe2\x80\x99s not much good my\r\ntelling anybody about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! why\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d they ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect anybody would believe me if I did,\xe2\x80\x9d replies the\r\nold fellow calmly, and without even a tinge of bitterness in his tone,\r\nas he refills his pipe, and requests the landlord to bring him three of\r\nScotch, cold.\r\n\r\nThere is a pause after this, nobody feeling sufficiently sure of\r\nhimself to contradict the old gentleman. So he has to go on by himself\r\nwithout any encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it myself if\r\nanybody told it to me, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, for all that. I had been\r\nsitting there all the afternoon and had caught literally nothing\xe2\x80\x94except\r\na few dozen dace and a score of jack; and I was just about giving it up\r\nas a bad job when I suddenly felt a rather smart pull at the line. I\r\nthought it was another little one, and I went to jerk it up. Hang me,\r\nif I could move the rod! It took me half-an-hour\xe2\x80\x94half-an-hour, sir!\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nland that fish; and every moment I thought the line was going to snap!\r\nI reached him at last, and what do you think it was? A sturgeon! a\r\nforty pound sturgeon! taken on a line, sir! Yes, you may well look\r\nsurprised\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll have another three of Scotch, landlord, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he goes on to tell of the astonishment of everybody who saw\r\nit; and what his wife said, when he got home, and of what Joe Buggles\r\nthought about it.\r\n\r\nI asked the landlord of an inn up the river once, if it did not injure\r\nhim, sometimes, listening to the tales that the fishermen about there\r\ntold him; and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no; not now, sir. It did used to knock me over a bit at first,\r\nbut, lor love you! me and the missus we listens to \xe2\x80\x99em all day now.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re used to, you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re used to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew a young man once, he was a most conscientious fellow, and, when\r\nhe took to fly-fishing, he determined never to exaggerate his hauls by\r\nmore than twenty-five per cent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have caught forty fish,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I will tell people that\r\nI have caught fifty, and so on. But I will not lie any more than that,\r\nbecause it is sinful to lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the twenty-five per cent. plan did not work well at all. He never\r\nwas able to use it. The greatest number of fish he ever caught in one\r\nday was three, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t add twenty-five per cent. to three\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nleast, not in fish.\r\n\r\nSo he increased his percentage to thirty-three-and-a-third; but that,\r\nagain, was awkward, when he had only caught one or two; so, to simplify\r\nmatters, he made up his mind to just double the quantity.\r\n\r\nHe stuck to this arrangement for a couple of months, and then he grew\r\ndissatisfied with it. Nobody believed him when he told them that he\r\nonly doubled, and he, therefore, gained no credit that way whatever,\r\nwhile his moderation put him at a disadvantage among the other anglers.\r\nWhen he had really caught three small fish, and said he had caught six,\r\nit used to make him quite jealous to hear a man, whom he knew for a\r\nfact had only caught one, going about telling people he had landed two\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\nSo, eventually, he made one final arrangement with himself, which he\r\nhas religiously held to ever since, and that was to count each fish\r\nthat he caught as ten, and to assume ten to begin with. For example,\r\nif he did not catch any fish at all, then he said he had caught ten\r\nfish\xe2\x80\x94you could never catch less than ten fish by his system; that was\r\nthe foundation of it. Then, if by any chance he really did catch one\r\nfish, he called it twenty, while two fish would count thirty, three\r\nforty, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple and easily worked plan, and there has been some talk\r\nlately of its being made use of by the angling fraternity in general.\r\nIndeed, the Committee of the Thames Angler\xe2\x80\x99s Association did recommend\r\nits adoption about two years ago, but some of the older members opposed\r\nit. They said they would consider the idea if the number were doubled,\r\nand each fish counted as twenty.\r\n\r\nIf ever you have an evening to spare, up the river, I should advise\r\nyou to drop into one of the little village inns, and take a seat in\r\nthe tap-room. You will be nearly sure to meet one or two old rod-men,\r\nsipping their toddy there, and they will tell you enough fishy stories,\r\nin half an hour, to give you indigestion for a month.\r\n\r\nGeorge and I\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what had become of Harris; he had gone out\r\nand had a shave, early in the afternoon, and had then come back and\r\nspent full forty minutes in pipeclaying his shoes, we had not seen him\r\nsince\xe2\x80\x94George and I, therefore, and the dog, left to ourselves, went\r\nfor a walk to Wallingford on the second evening, and, coming home, we\r\ncalled in at a little river-side inn, for a rest, and other things.\r\n\r\nWe went into the parlour and sat down. There was an old fellow there,\r\nsmoking a long clay pipe, and we naturally began chatting.\r\n\r\nHe told us that it had been a fine day to-day, and we told him that it\r\nhad been a fine day yesterday, and then we all told each other that we\r\nthought it would be a fine day to-morrow; and George said the crops\r\nseemed to be coming up nicely.\r\n\r\nAfter that it came out, somehow or other, that we were strangers in the\r\nneighbourhood, and that we were going away the next morning.\r\n\r\n[Picture: The trout] Then a pause ensued in the conversation, during\r\nwhich our eyes wandered round the room. They finally rested upon a\r\ndusty old glass-case, fixed very high up above the chimney-piece, and\r\ncontaining a trout. It rather fascinated me, that trout; it was such a\r\nmonstrous fish. In fact, at first glance, I thought it was a cod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman, following the direction of my gaze, \xe2\x80\x9cfine\r\nfellow that, ain\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite uncommon,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured; and George asked the old man how much he\r\nthought it weighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEighteen pounds six ounces,\xe2\x80\x9d said our friend, rising and taking down\r\nhis coat. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit wur sixteen year ago, come the third\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 next month, that I landed him. I caught him just below the bridge\r\nwith a minnow. They told me he wur in the river, and I said I\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nhim, and so I did. You don\xe2\x80\x99t see many fish that size about here now,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking. Good-night, gentlemen, good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd out he went, and left us alone.\r\n\r\nWe could not take our eyes off the fish after that. It really was a\r\nremarkably fine fish. We were still looking at it, when the local\r\ncarrier, who had just stopped at the inn, came to the door of the room\r\nwith a pot of beer in his hand, and he also looked at the fish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-sized trout, that,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, turning round to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you may well say that, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the man; and then, after a\r\npull at his beer, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here, sir, when that fish\r\nwas caught?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d we told him. We were strangers in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the carrier, \xe2\x80\x9cthen, of course, how should you? It was nearly\r\nfive years ago that I caught that trout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! was it you who caught it, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the genial old fellow. \xe2\x80\x9cI caught him just below the\r\nlock\xe2\x80\x94leastways, what was the lock then\xe2\x80\x94one Friday afternoon; and the\r\nremarkable thing about it is that I caught him with a fly. I\xe2\x80\x99d gone out\r\npike fishing, bless you, never thinking of a trout, and when I saw that\r\nwhopper on the end of my line, blest if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite take me aback.\r\nWell, you see, he weighed twenty-six pound. Good-night, gentlemen,\r\ngood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive minutes afterwards, a third man came in, and described how _he_\r\nhad caught it early one morning, with bleak; and then he left, and a\r\nstolid, solemn-looking, middle-aged individual came in, and sat down\r\nover by the window.\r\n\r\nNone of us spoke for a while; but, at length, George turned to the new\r\ncomer, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, I hope you will forgive the liberty that we\xe2\x80\x94perfect\r\nstrangers in the neighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94are taking, but my friend here and\r\nmyself would be so much obliged if you would tell us how you caught\r\nthat trout up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, who told you I caught that trout!\xe2\x80\x9d was the surprised query.\r\n\r\nWe said that nobody had told us so, but somehow or other we felt\r\ninstinctively that it was he who had done it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a most remarkable thing\xe2\x80\x94most remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\nstolid stranger, laughing; \xe2\x80\x9cbecause, as a matter of fact, you are quite\r\nright. I did catch it. But fancy your guessing it like that. Dear me,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s really a most remarkable thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he went on, and told us how it had taken him half an hour\r\nto land it, and how it had broken his rod. He said he had weighed\r\nit carefully when he reached home, and it had turned the scale at\r\nthirty-four pounds.\r\n\r\nHe went in his turn, and when he was gone, the landlord came in to us.\r\nWe told him the various histories we had heard about his trout, and he\r\nwas immensely amused, and we all laughed very heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFancy Jim Bates and Joe Muggles and Mr. Jones and old Billy Maunders\r\nall telling you that they had caught it. Ha! ha! ha! Well, that is\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x9d said the honest old fellow, laughing heartily. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are\r\nthe sort to give it _me_, to put up in _my_ parlour, if _they_ had\r\ncaught it, they are! Ha! ha! ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he told us the real history of the fish. It seemed that he had\r\ncaught it himself, years ago, when he was quite a lad; not by any art\r\nor skill, but by that unaccountable luck that appears to always wait\r\nupon a boy when he plays the wag from school, and goes out fishing on a\r\nsunny afternoon, with a bit of string tied on to the end of a tree.\r\n\r\nHe said that bringing home that trout had saved him from a whacking,\r\nand that even his school-master had said it was worth the rule-of-three\r\nand practice put together.\r\n\r\nHe was called out of the room at this point, and George and I again\r\nturned our gaze upon the fish.\r\n\r\nIt really was a most astonishing trout. The more we looked at it, the\r\nmore we marvelled at it.\r\n\r\nIt excited George so much that he climbed up on the back of a chair to\r\nget a better view of it.\r\n\r\nAnd then the chair slipped, and George clutched wildly at the\r\ntrout-case to save himself, and down it came with a crash, George and\r\nthe chair on top of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t injured the fish, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried in alarm, rushing up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, rising cautiously and looking about.\r\n\r\nBut he had. That trout lay shattered into a thousand fragments\xe2\x80\x94I say\r\na thousand, but they may have only been nine hundred. I did not count\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe thought it strange and unaccountable that a stuffed trout should\r\nbreak up into little pieces like that.\r\n\r\nAnd so it would have been strange and unaccountable, if it had been a\r\nstuffed trout, but it was not.\r\n\r\nThat trout was plaster-of-Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocks.\xe2\x80\x94George and I are\r\nphotographed.\xe2\x80\x94Wallingford.\xe2\x80\x94Dorchester.\xe2\x80\x94Abingdon.\xe2\x80\x94A family man.\xe2\x80\x94A good\r\nspot for drowning.\xe2\x80\x94A difficult bit of water.\xe2\x80\x94Demoralizing effect of\r\nriver air.\r\n\r\nWe left Streatley early the next morning, and pulled up to Culham, and\r\nslept under the canvas, in the backwater there.\r\n\r\nThe river is not extraordinarily interesting between Streatley and\r\nWallingford. From Cleve you get a stretch of six and a half miles\r\nwithout a lock. I believe this is the longest uninterrupted stretch\r\nanywhere above Teddington, and the Oxford Club make use of it for their\r\ntrial eights.\r\n\r\nBut however satisfactory this absence of locks may be to rowing-men, it\r\nis to be regretted by the mere pleasure-seeker.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I am fond of locks. They pleasantly break the monotony of\r\nthe pull. I like sitting in the boat and slowly rising out of the cool\r\ndepths up into new reaches and fresh views; or sinking down, as it\r\nwere, out of the world, and then waiting, while the gloomy gates creak,\r\nand the narrow strip of day-light between them widens till the fair\r\nsmiling river lies full before you, and you push your little boat out\r\nfrom its brief prison on to the welcoming waters once again.\r\n\r\nThey are picturesque little spots, these locks. The stout old\r\nlock-keeper, or his cheerful-looking wife, or bright-eyed daughter,\r\nare pleasant folk to have a passing chat with. {287} You meet other\r\nboats there, and river gossip is exchanged. The Thames would not be the\r\nfairyland it is without its flower-decked locks.\r\n\r\nTalking of locks reminds me of an accident George and I very nearly had\r\none summer\xe2\x80\x99s morning at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day, and the lock was crowded; and, as is a common\r\npractice up the river, a speculative photographer was taking a picture\r\nof us all as we lay upon the rising waters.\r\n\r\nI did not catch what was going on at first, and was, therefore,\r\nextremely surprised at noticing George hurriedly smooth out his\r\ntrousers, ruffle up his hair, and stick his cap on in a rakish manner\r\nat the back of his head, and then, assuming an expression of mingled\r\naffability and sadness, sit down in a graceful attitude, and try to\r\nhide his feet.\r\n\r\nMy first idea was that he had suddenly caught sight of some girl he\r\nknew, and I looked about to see who it was. Everybody in the lock\r\nseemed to have been suddenly struck wooden. They were all standing or\r\nsitting about in the most quaint and curious attitudes I have ever seen\r\noff a Japanese fan. All the girls were smiling. Oh, they did look so\r\nsweet! And all the fellows were frowning, and looking stern and noble.\r\n\r\nAnd then, at last, the truth flashed across me, and I wondered if I\r\nshould be in time. Ours was the first boat, and it would be unkind of\r\nme to spoil the man\xe2\x80\x99s picture, I thought.\r\n\r\nSo I faced round quickly, and took up a position in the prow, where I\r\nleant with careless grace upon the hitcher, in an attitude suggestive\r\nof agility and strength. I arranged my hair with a curl over the\r\nforehead, and threw an air of tender wistfulness into my expression,\r\nmingled with a touch of cynicism, which I am told suits me.\r\n\r\nAs we stood, waiting for the eventful moment, I heard someone behind\r\ncall out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHi! look at your nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not turn round to see what was the matter, and whose nose it\r\nwas that was to be looked at. I stole a side-glance at George\xe2\x80\x99s nose!\r\nIt was all right\xe2\x80\x94at all events, there was nothing wrong with it that\r\ncould be altered. I squinted down at my own, and that seemed all that\r\ncould be expected also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at your nose, you stupid ass!\xe2\x80\x9d came the same voice again, louder.\r\n\r\nAnd then another voice cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPush your nose out, can\xe2\x80\x99t you, you\xe2\x80\x94you two with the dog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither George nor I dared to turn round. The man\xe2\x80\x99s hand was on the\r\ncap, and the picture might be taken any moment. Was it us they were\r\ncalling to? What was the matter with our noses? Why were they to be\r\npushed out!\r\n\r\nBut now the whole lock started yelling, and a stentorian voice from the\r\nback shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at your boat, sir; you in the red and black caps. It\xe2\x80\x99s your two\r\ncorpses that will get taken in that photo, if you ain\xe2\x80\x99t quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe looked then, and saw that the nose of our boat had got fixed under\r\nthe woodwork of the lock, while the in-coming water was rising all\r\naround it, and tilting it up. In another moment we should be over.\r\nQuick as thought, we each seized an oar, and a vigorous blow against\r\nthe side of the lock with the butt-ends released the boat, and sent us\r\nsprawling on our backs.\r\n\r\n[Picture: The photograph] We did not come out well in that photograph,\r\nGeorge and I. Of course, as was to be expected, our luck ordained it,\r\nthat the man should set his wretched machine in motion at the precise\r\nmoment that we were both lying on our backs with a wild expression of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I? and what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d on our faces, and our four feet waving\r\nmadly in the air.\r\n\r\nOur feet were undoubtedly the leading article in that photograph.\r\nIndeed, very little else was to be seen. They filled up the foreground\r\nentirely. Behind them, you caught glimpses of the other boats, and bits\r\nof the surrounding scenery; but everything and everybody else in the\r\nlock looked so utterly insignificant and paltry compared with our feet,\r\nthat all the other people felt quite ashamed of themselves, and refused\r\nto subscribe to the picture.\r\n\r\nThe owner of one steam launch, who had bespoke six copies, rescinded\r\nthe order on seeing the negative. He said he would take them if anybody\r\ncould show him his launch, but nobody could. It was somewhere behind\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s right foot.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of unpleasantness over the business. The\r\nphotographer thought we ought to take a dozen copies each, seeing that\r\nthe photo was about nine-tenths us, but we declined. We said we had no\r\nobjection to being photo\xe2\x80\x99d full-length, but we preferred being taken\r\nthe right way up.\r\n\r\nWallingford, six miles above Streatley, is a very ancient town, and has\r\nbeen an active centre for the making of English history. It was a rude,\r\nmud-built town in the time of the Britons, who squatted there, until\r\nthe Roman legions evicted them; and replaced their clay-baked walls by\r\nmighty fortifications, the trace of which Time has not yet succeeded in\r\nsweeping away, so well those old-world masons knew how to build.\r\n\r\nBut Time, though he halted at Roman walls, soon crumbled Romans to\r\ndust; and on the ground, in later years, fought savage Saxons and huge\r\nDanes, until the Normans came.\r\n\r\nIt was a walled and fortified town up to the time of the Parliamentary\r\nWar, when it suffered a long and bitter siege from Fairfax. It fell at\r\nlast, and then the walls were razed.\r\n\r\nFrom Wallingford up to Dorchester the neighbourhood of the river grows\r\nmore hilly, varied, and picturesque. Dorchester stands half a mile from\r\nthe river. It can be reached by paddling up the Thame, if you have a\r\nsmall boat; but the best way is to leave the river at Day\xe2\x80\x99s Lock, and\r\ntake a walk across the fields. Dorchester is a delightfully peaceful\r\nold place, nestling in stillness and silence and drowsiness.\r\n\r\nDorchester, like Wallingford, was a city in ancient British times;\r\nit was then called Caer Doren, \xe2\x80\x9cthe city on the water.\xe2\x80\x9d In more\r\nrecent times the Romans formed a great camp here, the fortifications\r\nsurrounding which now seem like low, even hills. In Saxon days it was\r\nthe capital of Wessex. It is very old, and it was very strong and great\r\nonce. Now it sits aside from the stirring world, and nods and dreams.\r\n\r\nRound Clifton Hampden, itself a wonderfully pretty village,\r\nold-fashioned, peaceful, and dainty with flowers, the river scenery\r\nis rich and beautiful. If you stay the night on land at Clifton, you\r\ncannot do better than put up at the \xe2\x80\x9cBarley Mow.\xe2\x80\x9d It is, without\r\nexception, I should say, the quaintest, most old-world inn up the\r\nriver. It stands on the right of the bridge, quite away from the\r\nvillage. Its low-pitched gables and thatched roof and latticed windows\r\ngive it quite a story-book appearance, while inside it is even still\r\nmore once-upon-a-timeyfied.\r\n\r\nIt would not be a good place for the heroine of a modern novel to stay\r\nat. The heroine of a modern novel is always \xe2\x80\x9cdivinely tall,\xe2\x80\x9d and she is\r\never \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing herself up to her full height.\xe2\x80\x9d At the \xe2\x80\x9cBarley Mow\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nwould bump her head against the ceiling each time she did this.\r\n\r\nIt would also be a bad house for a drunken man to put up at. There are\r\ntoo many surprises in the way of unexpected steps down into this room\r\nand up into that; and as for getting upstairs to his bedroom, or ever\r\nfinding his bed when he got up, either operation would be an utter\r\nimpossibility to him.\r\n\r\nWe were up early the next morning, as we wanted to be in Oxford by the\r\nafternoon. It is surprising how early one _can_ get up, when camping\r\nout. One does not yearn for \xe2\x80\x9cjust another five minutes\xe2\x80\x9d nearly so much,\r\nlying wrapped up in a rug on the boards of a boat, with a Gladstone bag\r\nfor a pillow, as one does in a featherbed. We had finished breakfast,\r\nand were through Clifton Lock by half-past eight.\r\n\r\nFrom Clifton to Culham the river banks are flat, monotonous, and\r\nuninteresting, but, after you get through Culhalm Lock\xe2\x80\x94the coldest and\r\ndeepest lock on the river\xe2\x80\x94the landscape improves.\r\n\r\nAt Abingdon, the river passes by the streets. Abingdon is a typical\r\ncountry town of the smaller order\xe2\x80\x94quiet, eminently respectable, clean,\r\nand desperately dull. It prides itself on being old, but whether it\r\ncan compare in this respect with Wallingford and Dorchester seems\r\ndoubtful. A famous abbey stood here once, and within what is left of\r\nits sanctified walls they brew bitter ale nowadays.\r\n\r\nIn St. Nicholas Church, at Abingdon, there is a monument to John\r\nBlackwall and his wife Jane, who both, after leading a happy married\r\nlife, died on the very same day, August 21, 1625; and in St. Helen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nChurch, it is recorded that W. Lee, who died in 1637, \xe2\x80\x9chad in his\r\nlifetime issue from his loins two hundred lacking but three.\xe2\x80\x9d If you\r\nwork this out you will find that Mr. W. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s family numbered one\r\nhundred and ninety-seven. Mr. W. Lee\xe2\x80\x94five times Mayor of Abingdon\xe2\x80\x94was,\r\nno doubt, a benefactor to his generation, but I hope there are not many\r\nof his kind about in this overcrowded nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nFrom Abingdon to Nuneham Courteney is a lovely stretch. Nuneham Park\r\nis well worth a visit. It can be viewed on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The\r\nhouse contains a fine collection of pictures and curiosities, and the\r\ngrounds are very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe pool under Sandford lasher, just behind the lock, is a very good\r\nplace to drown yourself in. The undercurrent is terribly strong, and if\r\nyou once get down into it you are all right. An obelisk marks the spot\r\nwhere two men have already been drowned, while bathing there; and the\r\nsteps of the obelisk are generally used as a diving-board by young men\r\nnow who wish to see if the place really _is_ dangerous.\r\n\r\n                          [Picture: River scene]\r\n\r\nIffley Lock and Mill, a mile before you reach Oxford, is a favourite\r\nsubject with the river-loving brethren of the brush. The real article,\r\nhowever, is rather disappointing, after the pictures. Few things, I\r\nhave noticed, come quite up to the pictures of them, in this world.\r\n\r\nWe passed through Iffley Lock at about half-past twelve, and then,\r\nhaving tidied up the boat and made all ready for landing, we set to\r\nwork on our last mile.\r\n\r\nBetween Iffley and Oxford is the most difficult bit of the river I\r\nknow. You want to be born on that bit of water, to understand it. I\r\nhave been over it a fairish number of times, but I have never been able\r\nto get the hang of it. The man who could row a straight course from\r\nOxford to Iffley ought to be able to live comfortably, under one roof,\r\nwith his wife, his mother-in-law, his elder sister, and the old servant\r\nwho was in the family when he was a baby.\r\n\r\nFirst the current drives you on to the right bank, and then on to the\r\nleft, then it takes you out into the middle, turns you round three\r\ntimes, and carries you up stream again, and always ends by trying to\r\nsmash you up against a college barge.\r\n\r\nOf course, as a consequence of this, we got in the way of a good many\r\nother boats, during the mile, and they in ours, and, of course, as a\r\nconsequence of that, a good deal of bad language occurred.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it should be, but everybody is always so exceptionally\r\nirritable on the river. Little mishaps, that you would hardly notice on\r\ndry land, drive you nearly frantic with rage, when they occur on the\r\nwater. When Harris or George makes an ass of himself on dry land, I\r\nsmile indulgently; when they behave in a chuckle-head way on the river,\r\nI use the most blood-curdling language to them. When another boat gets\r\nin my way, I feel I want to take an oar and kill all the people in it.\r\n\r\nThe mildest tempered people, when on land, become violent and\r\nblood-thirsty when in a boat. I did a little boating once with a young\r\nlady. She was naturally of the sweetest and gentlest disposition\r\nimaginable, but on the river it was quite awful to hear her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, drat the man!\xe2\x80\x9d she would exclaim, when some unfortunate sculler\r\nwould get in her way; \xe2\x80\x9cwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t he look where he\xe2\x80\x99s going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, bother the silly old thing!\xe2\x80\x9d she would say indignantly, when\r\nthe sail would not go up properly. And she would catch hold of it, and\r\nshake it quite brutally.\r\n\r\nYet, as I have said, when on shore she was kind-hearted and amiable\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Man at the lock] [Picture: Man at the lock] The air of the\r\nriver has a demoralising effect upon one\xe2\x80\x99s temper, and this it is,\r\nI suppose, which causes even barge men to be sometimes rude to one\r\nanother, and to use language which, no doubt, in their calmer moments\r\nthey regret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOxford.\xe2\x80\x94Montmorency\xe2\x80\x99s idea of Heaven.\xe2\x80\x94The hired up-river boat,\r\nits beauties and advantages.\xe2\x80\x94The \xe2\x80\x9cPride of the Thames.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94The\r\nweather changes.\xe2\x80\x94The river under different aspects.\xe2\x80\x94Not a cheerful\r\nevening.\xe2\x80\x94Yearnings for the unattainable.\xe2\x80\x94The cheery chat goes\r\nround.\xe2\x80\x94George performs upon the banjo.\xe2\x80\x94A mournful melody.\xe2\x80\x94Another wet\r\nday.\xe2\x80\x94Flight.\xe2\x80\x94A little supper and a toast.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Dog running] We spent two very pleasant days at Oxford. There\r\nare plenty of dogs in the town of Oxford. Montmorency had eleven fights\r\non the first day, and fourteen on the second, and evidently thought he\r\nhad got to heaven.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Dogs fighting] Among folk too constitutionally weak, or too\r\nconstitutionally lazy, whichever it may be, to relish up-stream work,\r\nit is a common practice to get a boat at Oxford, and row down. For the\r\nenergetic, however, the up-stream journey is certainly to be preferred.\r\nIt does not seem good to be always going with the current. There is\r\nmore satisfaction in squaring one\xe2\x80\x99s back, and fighting against it, and\r\nwinning one\xe2\x80\x99s way forward in spite of it\xe2\x80\x94at least, so I feel, when\r\nHarris and George are sculling and I am steering.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Dog running] To those who do contemplate making Oxford their\r\nstarting-place, I would say, take your own boat\xe2\x80\x94unless, of course, you\r\ncan take someone else\xe2\x80\x99s without any possible danger of being found\r\nout. The boats that, as a rule, are let for hire on the Thames above\r\nMarlow, are very good boats. They are fairly water-tight; and so long\r\nas they are handled with care, they rarely come to pieces, or sink.\r\nThere are places in them to sit down on, and they are complete with all\r\nthe necessary arrangements\xe2\x80\x94or nearly all\xe2\x80\x94to enable you to row them and\r\nsteer them.\r\n\r\nBut they are not ornamental. The boat you hire up the river above\r\nMarlow is not the sort of boat in which you can flash about and give\r\nyourself airs. The hired up-river boat very soon puts a stop to any\r\nnonsense of that sort on the part of its occupants. That is its\r\nchief\xe2\x80\x94one may say, its only recommendation.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Dog] The man in the hired up-river boat is modest and\r\nretiring. He likes to keep on the shady side, underneath the trees, and\r\nto do most of his travelling early in the morning or late at night,\r\nwhen there are not many people about on the river to look at him.\r\n\r\nWhen the man in the hired up-river boat sees anyone he knows, he gets\r\nout on to the bank, and hides behind a tree.\r\n\r\nI was one of a party who hired an up-river boat one summer, for a few\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 trip. We had none of us ever seen the hired up-river boat before;\r\nand we did not know what it was when we did see it.\r\n\r\nWe had written for a boat\xe2\x80\x94a double sculling skiff; and when we went\r\ndown with our bags to the yard, and gave our names, the man said:\r\n\r\n[Picture: The Pride of the Thames] \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; you\xe2\x80\x99re the party that\r\nwrote for a double sculling skiff. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Jim, fetch round\r\n_The Pride of the Thames_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy went, and re-appeared five minutes afterwards, struggling\r\nwith an antediluvian chunk of wood, that looked as though it had been\r\nrecently dug out of somewhere, and dug out carelessly, so as to have\r\nbeen unnecessarily damaged in the process.\r\n\r\nMy own idea, on first catching sight of the object, was that it was a\r\nRoman relic of some sort,\xe2\x80\x94relic of _what_ I do not know, possibly of a\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of the upper Thames is rich in Roman relics, and my\r\nsurmise seemed to me a very probable one; but our serious young man,\r\nwho is a bit of a geologist, pooh-poohed my Roman relic theory, and\r\nsaid it was clear to the meanest intellect (in which category he seemed\r\nto be grieved that he could not conscientiously include mine) that\r\nthe thing the boy had found was the fossil of a whale; and he pointed\r\nout to us various evidences proving that it must have belonged to the\r\npreglacial period.\r\n\r\nTo settle the dispute, we appealed to the boy. We told him not to\r\nbe afraid, but to speak the plain truth: Was it the fossil of a\r\npre-Adamite whale, or was it an early Roman coffin?\r\n\r\nThe boy said it was _The Pride of the Thames_.\r\n\r\nWe thought this a very humorous answer on the part of the boy at first,\r\nand somebody gave him twopence as a reward for his ready wit; but when\r\nhe persisted in keeping up the joke, as we thought, too long, we got\r\nvexed with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, my lad!\xe2\x80\x9d said our captain sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t let us have any\r\nnonsense. You take your mother\xe2\x80\x99s washing-tub home again, and bring us a\r\nboat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boat-builder himself came up then, and assured us, on his word, as\r\na practical man, that the thing really was a boat\xe2\x80\x94was, in fact, _the_\r\nboat, the \xe2\x80\x9cdouble sculling skiff\xe2\x80\x9d selected to take us on our trip down\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nWe grumbled a good deal. We thought he might, at least, have had it\r\nwhitewashed or tarred\xe2\x80\x94had _something_ done to it to distinguish it from\r\na bit of a wreck; but he could not see any fault in it.\r\n\r\nHe even seemed offended at our remarks. He said he had picked us out\r\nthe best boat in all his stock, and he thought we might have been more\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\nHe said it, _The Pride of the Thames_, had been in use, just as it now\r\nstood (or rather as it now hung together), for the last forty years, to\r\n_his_ knowledge, and nobody had complained of it before, and he did not\r\nsee why we should be the first to begin.\r\n\r\nWe argued no more.\r\n\r\nWe fastened the so-called boat together with some pieces of string,\r\ngot a bit of wall-paper and pasted over the shabbier places, said our\r\nprayers, and stepped on board.\r\n\r\nThey charged us thirty-five shillings for the loan of the remnant\r\nfor six days; and we could have bought the thing out-and-out for\r\nfour-and-sixpence at any sale of drift-wood round the coast.\r\n\r\nThe weather changed on the third day,\xe2\x80\x94Oh! I am talking about our\r\npresent trip now,\xe2\x80\x94and we started from Oxford upon our homeward journey\r\nin the midst of a steady drizzle.\r\n\r\nThe river\xe2\x80\x94with the sunlight flashing from its dancing wavelets, gilding\r\ngold the grey-green beech-trunks, glinting through the dark, cool wood\r\npaths, chasing shadows o\xe2\x80\x99er the shallows, flinging diamonds from the\r\nmill-wheels, throwing kisses to the lilies, wantoning with the weirs\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwhite waters, silvering moss-grown walls and bridges, brightening every\r\ntiny townlet, making sweet each lane and meadow, lying tangled in the\r\nrushes, peeping, laughing, from each inlet, gleaming gay on many a far\r\nsail, making soft the air with glory\xe2\x80\x94is a golden fairy stream.\r\n\r\nBut the river\xe2\x80\x94chill and weary, with the ceaseless rain-drops falling on\r\nits brown and sluggish waters, with a sound as of a woman, weeping low\r\nin some dark chamber; while the woods, all dark and silent, shrouded in\r\ntheir mists of vapour, stand like ghosts upon the margin; silent ghosts\r\nwith eyes reproachful, like the ghosts of evil actions, like the ghosts\r\nof friends neglected\xe2\x80\x94is a spirit-haunted water through the land of vain\r\nregrets.\r\n\r\nSunlight is the life-blood of Nature. Mother Earth looks at us with\r\nsuch dull, soulless eyes, when the sunlight has died away from out of\r\nher. It makes us sad to be with her then; she does not seem to know\r\nus or to care for us. She is as a widow who has lost the husband she\r\nloved, and her children touch her hand, and look up into her eyes, but\r\ngain no smile from her.\r\n\r\nWe rowed on all that day through the rain, and very melancholy work\r\nit was. We pretended, at first, that we enjoyed it. We said it was a\r\nchange, and that we liked to see the river under all its different\r\naspects. We said we could not expect to have it all sunshine, nor\r\nshould we wish it. We told each other that Nature was beautiful, even\r\nin her tears.\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: The boat in the rain]\r\n\r\nIndeed, Harris and I were quite enthusiastic about the business, for\r\nthe first few hours. And we sang a song about a gipsy\xe2\x80\x99s life, and how\r\ndelightful a gipsy\xe2\x80\x99s existence was!\xe2\x80\x94free to storm and sunshine, and to\r\nevery wind that blew!\xe2\x80\x94and how he enjoyed the rain, and what a lot of\r\ngood it did him; and how he laughed at people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\r\n\r\nGeorge took the fun more soberly, and stuck to the umbrella.\r\n\r\nWe hoisted the cover before we had lunch, and kept it up all the\r\nafternoon, just leaving a little space in the bow, from which one of us\r\ncould paddle and keep a look-out. In this way we made nine miles, and\r\npulled up for the night a little below Day\xe2\x80\x99s Lock.\r\n\r\nI cannot honestly say that we had a merry evening. The rain poured\r\ndown with quiet persistency. Everything in the boat was damp and\r\nclammy. Supper was not a success. Cold veal pie, when you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel\r\nhungry, is apt to cloy. I felt I wanted whitebait and a cutlet; Harris\r\nbabbled of soles and white-sauce, and passed the remains of his pie to\r\nMontmorency, who declined it, and, apparently insulted by the offer,\r\nwent and sat over at the other end of the boat by himself.\r\n\r\nGeorge requested that we would not talk about these things, at all\r\nevents until he had finished his cold boiled beef without mustard.\r\n\r\nWe played penny nap after supper. We played for about an hour and a\r\nhalf, by the end of which time George had won fourpence\xe2\x80\x94George always\r\nis lucky at cards\xe2\x80\x94and Harris and I had lost exactly twopence each.\r\n\r\nWe thought we would give up gambling then. As Harris said, it breeds an\r\nunhealthy excitement when carried too far. George offered to go on and\r\ngive us our revenge; but Harris and I decided not to battle any further\r\nagainst Fate.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we mixed ourselves some toddy, and sat round and talked.\r\nGeorge told us about a man he had known, who had come up the river\r\ntwo years ago and who had slept out in a damp boat on just such\r\nanother night as that was, and it had given him rheumatic fever, and\r\nnothing was able to save him, and he had died in great agony ten days\r\nafterwards. George said he was quite a young man, and was engaged to be\r\nmarried. He said it was one of the saddest things he had ever known.\r\n\r\nAnd that put Harris in mind of a friend of his, who had been in the\r\nVolunteers, and who had slept out under canvas one wet night down at\r\nAldershot, \xe2\x80\x9con just such another night as this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris; and he\r\nhad woke up in the morning a cripple for life. Harris said he would\r\nintroduce us both to the man when we got back to town; it would make\r\nour hearts bleed to see him.\r\n\r\nThis naturally led to some pleasant chat about sciatica, fevers,\r\nchills, lung diseases, and bronchitis; and Harris said how very awkward\r\nit would be if one of us were taken seriously ill in the night, seeing\r\nhow far away we were from a doctor.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be a desire for something frolicksome to follow upon\r\nthis conversation, and in a weak moment I suggested that George should\r\nget out his banjo, and see if he could not give us a comic song.\r\n\r\nI will say for George that he did not want any pressing. There was no\r\nnonsense about having left his music at home, or anything of that sort.\r\nHe at once fished out his instrument, and commenced to play \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Lovely\r\nBlack Eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had always regarded \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Lovely Black Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d as rather a commonplace\r\ntune until that evening. The rich vein of sadness that George extracted\r\nfrom it quite surprised me.\r\n\r\nThe desire that grew upon Harris and myself, as the mournful strains\r\nprogressed, was to fall upon each other\xe2\x80\x99s necks and weep; but by great\r\neffort we kept back the rising tears, and listened to the wild yearnful\r\nmelody in silence.\r\n\r\nWhen the chorus came we even made a desperate effort to be merry. We\r\nre-filled our glasses and joined in; Harris, in a voice trembling with\r\nemotion, leading, and George and I following a few words behind:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cTwo lovely black eyes;\r\n          Oh! what a surprise!\r\n    Only for telling a man he was wrong,\r\n          Two\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere we broke down. The unutterable pathos of George\xe2\x80\x99s accompaniment\r\nto that \xe2\x80\x9ctwo\xe2\x80\x9d we were, in our then state of depression, unable to bear.\r\nHarris sobbed like a little child, and the dog howled till I thought\r\nhis heart or his jaw must surely break.\r\n\r\nGeorge wanted to go on with another verse. He thought that when he had\r\ngot a little more into the tune, and could throw more \xe2\x80\x9cabandon,\xe2\x80\x9d as it\r\nwere, into the rendering, it might not seem so sad. The feeling of the\r\nmajority, however, was opposed to the experiment.\r\n\r\nThere being nothing else to do, we went to bed\xe2\x80\x94that is, we undressed\r\nourselves, and tossed about at the bottom of the boat for some three or\r\nfour hours. After which, we managed to get some fitful slumber until\r\nfive a.m., when we all got up and had breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe second day was exactly like the first. The rain continued to pour\r\ndown, and we sat, wrapped up in our mackintoshes, underneath the canvas,\r\nand drifted slowly down.\r\n\r\nOne of us\xe2\x80\x94I forget which one now, but I rather think it was\r\nmyself\xe2\x80\x94made a few feeble attempts during the course of the morning to\r\nwork up the old gipsy foolishness about being children of Nature and\r\nenjoying the wet; but it did not go down well at all. That\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI care not for the rain, not I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nwas so painfully evident, as expressing the sentiments of each of us,\r\nthat to sing it seemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\nOn one point we were all agreed, and that was that, come what might,\r\nwe would go through with this job to the bitter end. We had come out\r\nfor a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment on the river, and a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment\r\non the river we meant to have. If it killed us! well, that would be a\r\nsad thing for our friends and relations, but it could not be helped. We\r\nfelt that to give in to the weather in a climate such as ours would be\r\na most disastrous precedent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only two days more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris, \xe2\x80\x9cand we are young and strong.\r\nWe may get over it all right, after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock we began to discuss our arrangements for the\r\nevening. We were a little past Goring then, and we decided to paddle on\r\nto Pangbourne, and put up there for the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother jolly evening!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured George.\r\n\r\nWe sat and mused on the prospect. We should be in at Pangbourne by\r\nfive. We should finish dinner at, say, half-past six. After that we\r\ncould walk about the village in the pouring rain until bed-time; or we\r\ncould sit in a dimly-lit bar-parlour and read the almanac.\r\n\r\n[Picture: Lady in skirt] \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the Alhambra would be almost more\r\nlively,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris, venturing his head outside the cover for a moment\r\nand taking a survey of the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a little supper at the --- {311} to follow,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, half\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it\xe2\x80\x99s almost a pity we\xe2\x80\x99ve made up our minds to stick to this boat,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nanswered Harris; and then there was silence for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we _hadn\xe2\x80\x99t_ made up our minds to contract our certain deaths in\r\nthis bally old coffin,\xe2\x80\x9d observed George, casting a glance of intense\r\nmalevolence over the boat, \xe2\x80\x9cit might be worth while to mention that\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a train leaves Pangbourne, I know, soon after five, which would\r\njust land us in town in comfortable time to get a chop, and then go on\r\nto the place you mentioned afterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody spoke. We looked at one another, and each one seemed to see his\r\nown mean and guilty thoughts reflected in the faces of the others. In\r\nsilence, we dragged out and overhauled the Gladstone. We looked up the\r\nriver and down the river; not a soul was in sight!\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later, three figures, followed by a shamed-looking dog,\r\nmight have been seen creeping stealthily from the boat-house at the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwan\xe2\x80\x9d towards the railway station, dressed in the following neither\r\nneat nor gaudy costume:\r\n\r\nBlack leather shoes, dirty; suit of boating flannels, very dirty; brown\r\nfelt hat, much battered; mackintosh, very wet; umbrella.\r\n\r\nWe had deceived the boatman at Pangbourne. We had not had the face to\r\ntell him that we were running away from the rain. We had left the boat,\r\nand all it contained, in his charge, with instructions that it was to\r\nbe ready for us at nine the next morning. If, we said\xe2\x80\x94_if_ anything\r\nunforeseen should happen, preventing our return, we would write to him.\r\n\r\nWe reached Paddington at seven, and drove direct to the restaurant\r\nI have before described, where we partook of a light meal, left\r\nMontmorency, together with suggestions for a supper to be ready at\r\nhalf-past ten, and then continued our way to Leicester Square.\r\n\r\nWe attracted a good deal of attention at the Alhambra. On our\r\npresenting ourselves at the paybox we were gruffly directed to go round\r\nto Castle Street, and were informed that we were half-an-hour behind\r\nour time.\r\n\r\nWe convinced the man, with some difficulty, that we were _not_ \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nworld-renowned contortionists from the Himalaya Mountains,\xe2\x80\x9d and he took\r\nour money and let us pass.\r\n\r\nInside we were a still greater success. Our fine bronzed countenances\r\nand picturesque clothes were followed round the place with admiring\r\ngaze. We were the cynosure of every eye.\r\n\r\nIt was a proud moment for us all.\r\n\r\nWe adjourned soon after the first ballet, and wended our way back to\r\nthe restaurant, where supper was already awaiting us.\r\n\r\nI must confess to enjoying that supper. For about ten days we seemed\r\nto have been living, more or less, on nothing but cold meat, cake, and\r\nbread and jam. It had been a simple, a nutritious diet; but there had\r\nbeen nothing exciting about it, and the odour of Burgundy, and the\r\nsmell of French sauces, and the sight of clean napkins and long loaves,\r\nknocked as a very welcome visitor at the door of our inner man.\r\n\r\nWe pegged and quaffed away in silence for a while, until the time\r\ncame when, instead of sitting bolt upright, and grasping the knife\r\nand fork firmly, we leant back in our chairs and worked slowly and\r\ncarelessly\xe2\x80\x94when we stretched out our legs beneath the table, let our\r\nnapkins fall, unheeded, to the floor, and found time to more critically\r\nexamine the smoky ceiling than we had hitherto been able to do\xe2\x80\x94when we\r\nrested our glasses at arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length upon the table, and felt good, and\r\nthoughtful, and forgiving.\r\n\r\nThen Harris, who was sitting next the window, drew aside the curtain\r\nand looked out upon the street.\r\n\r\nIt glistened darkly in the wet, the dim lamps flickered with each gust,\r\nthe rain splashed steadily into the puddles and trickled down the\r\nwater-spouts into the running gutters. A few soaked wayfarers hurried\r\npast, crouching beneath their dripping umbrellas, the women holding up\r\ntheir skirts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harris, reaching his hand out for his glass, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have had\r\na pleasant trip, and my hearty thanks for it to old Father Thames\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nthink we did well to chuck it when we did. Here\xe2\x80\x99s to Three Men well out\r\nof a Boat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Montmorency, standing on his hind legs, before the window, peering\r\nout into the night, gave a short bark of decided concurrence with the\r\ntoast.\r\n\r\n                   [Picture: Neptune drinking a toast]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n{287} Or rather _were_.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
