CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTHE PARSONAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll true histories contain instruction; though, in some, the treasure\r\nmay be hard to find, and when found, so trivial in quantity, that the\r\ndry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensates for the trouble of cracking\r\nthe nut. Whether this be the case with my history or not, I am hardly\r\ncompetent to judge. I sometimes think it might prove useful to some,\r\nand entertaining to others; but the world may judge for itself.\r\nShielded by my own obscurity, and by the lapse of years, and a few\r\nfictitious names, I do not fear to venture; and will candidly lay\r\nbefore the public what I would not disclose to the most intimate\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nMy father was a clergyman of the north of England, who was deservedly\r\nrespected by all who knew him; and, in his younger days, lived pretty\r\ncomfortably on the joint income of a small incumbency and a snug little\r\nproperty of his own. My mother, who married him against the wishes of\r\nher friends, was a squire\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and a woman of spirit. In vain it\r\nwas represented to her, that if she became the poor parson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, she\r\nmust relinquish her carriage and her lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid, and all the luxuries\r\nand elegancies of affluence; which to her were little less than the\r\nnecessaries of life. A carriage and a lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid were great\r\nconveniences; but, thank heaven, she had feet to carry her, and hands\r\nto minister to her own necessities. An elegant house and spacious\r\ngrounds were not to be despised; but she would rather live in a cottage\r\nwith Richard Grey than in a palace with any other man in the world.\r\n\r\nFinding arguments of no avail, her father, at length, told the lovers\r\nthey might marry if they pleased; but, in so doing, his daughter would\r\nforfeit every fraction of her fortune. He expected this would cool the\r\nardour of both; but he was mistaken. My father knew too well my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s superior worth not to be sensible that she was a valuable\r\nfortune in herself: and if she would but consent to embellish his\r\nhumble hearth he should be happy to take her on any terms; while she,\r\non her part, would rather labour with her own hands than be divided\r\nfrom the man she loved, whose happiness it would be her joy to make,\r\nand who was already one with her in heart and soul. So her fortune went\r\nto swell the purse of a wiser sister, who had married a rich nabob; and\r\nshe, to the wonder and compassionate regret of all who knew her, went\r\nto bury herself in the homely village parsonage among the hills of \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\nAnd yet, in spite of all this, and in spite of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s high spirit\r\nand my father\xe2\x80\x99s whims, I believe you might search all England through,\r\nand fail to find a happier couple.\r\n\r\nOf six children, my sister Mary and myself were the only two that\r\nsurvived the perils of infancy and early childhood. I, being the\r\nyounger by five or six years, was always regarded as _the_ child, and\r\nthe pet of the family: father, mother, and sister, all combined to\r\nspoil me\xe2\x80\x94not by foolish indulgence, to render me fractious and\r\nungovernable, but by ceaseless kindness, to make me too helpless and\r\ndependent\xe2\x80\x94too unfit for buffeting with the cares and turmoils of life.\r\n\r\nMary and I were brought up in the strictest seclusion. My mother, being\r\nat once highly accomplished, well informed, and fond of employment,\r\ntook the whole charge of our education on herself, with the exception\r\nof Latin\xe2\x80\x94which my father undertook to teach us\xe2\x80\x94so that we never even\r\nwent to school; and, as there was no society in the neighbourhood, our\r\nonly intercourse with the world consisted in a stately tea-party, now\r\nand then, with the principal farmers and tradespeople of the vicinity\r\n(just to avoid being stigmatized as too proud to consort with our\r\nneighbours), and an annual visit to our paternal grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s; where\r\nhimself, our kind grandmamma, a maiden aunt, and two or three elderly\r\nladies and gentlemen, were the only persons we ever saw. Sometimes our\r\nmother would amuse us with stories and anecdotes of her younger days,\r\nwhich, while they entertained us amazingly, frequently awoke\xe2\x80\x94in _me_,\r\nat least\xe2\x80\x94a secret wish to see a little more of the world.\r\n\r\nI thought she must have been very happy: but she never seemed to regret\r\npast times. My father, however, whose temper was neither tranquil nor\r\ncheerful by nature, often unduly vexed himself with thinking of the\r\nsacrifices his dear wife had made for him; and troubled his head with\r\nrevolving endless schemes for the augmentation of his little fortune,\r\nfor her sake and ours. In vain my mother assured him she was quite\r\nsatisfied; and if he would but lay by a little for the children, we\r\nshould all have plenty, both for time present and to come: but saving\r\nwas not my father\xe2\x80\x99s forte. He would not run in debt (at least, my\r\nmother took good care he should not), but while he had money he must\r\nspend it: he liked to see his house comfortable, and his wife and\r\ndaughters well clothed, and well attended; and besides, he was\r\ncharitably disposed, and liked to give to the poor, according to his\r\nmeans: or, as some might think, beyond them.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, a kind friend suggested to him a means of doubling\r\nhis private property at one stroke; and further increasing it,\r\nhereafter, to an untold amount. This friend was a merchant, a man of\r\nenterprising spirit and undoubted talent, who was somewhat straitened\r\nin his mercantile pursuits for want of capital; but generously proposed\r\nto give my father a fair share of his profits, if he would only entrust\r\nhim with what he could spare; and he thought he might safely promise\r\nthat whatever sum the latter chose to put into his hands, it should\r\nbring him in cent. per cent. The small patrimony was speedily sold, and\r\nthe whole of its price was deposited in the hands of the friendly\r\nmerchant; who as promptly proceeded to ship his cargo, and prepare for\r\nhis voyage.\r\n\r\nMy father was delighted, so were we all, with our brightening\r\nprospects. For the present, it is true, we were reduced to the narrow\r\nincome of the curacy; but my father seemed to think there was no\r\nnecessity for scrupulously restricting our expenditure to that; so,\r\nwith a standing bill at Mr. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s, another at Smith\xe2\x80\x99s, and a third\r\nat Hobson\xe2\x80\x99s, we got along even more comfortably than before: though my\r\nmother affirmed we had better keep within bounds, for our prospects of\r\nwealth were but precarious, after all; and if my father would only\r\ntrust everything to her management, he should never feel himself\r\nstinted: but he, for once, was incorrigible.\r\n\r\nWhat happy hours Mary and I have passed while sitting at our work by\r\nthe fire, or wandering on the heath-clad hills, or idling under the\r\nweeping birch (the only considerable tree in the garden), talking of\r\nfuture happiness to ourselves and our parents, of what we would do, and\r\nsee, and possess; with no firmer foundation for our goodly\r\nsuperstructure than the riches that were expected to flow in upon us\r\nfrom the success of the worthy merchant\xe2\x80\x99s speculations. Our father was\r\nnearly as bad as ourselves; only that he affected not to be so much in\r\nearnest: expressing his bright hopes and sanguine expectations in jests\r\nand playful sallies, that always struck me as being exceedingly witty\r\nand pleasant. Our mother laughed with delight to see him so hopeful and\r\nhappy: but still she feared he was setting his heart too much upon the\r\nmatter; and once I heard her whisper as she left the room, \xe2\x80\x9cGod grant\r\nhe be not disappointed! I know not how he would bear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDisappointed he was; and bitterly, too. It came like a thunder-clap on\r\nus all, that the vessel which contained our fortune had been wrecked,\r\nand gone to the bottom with all its stores, together with several of\r\nthe crew, and the unfortunate merchant himself. I was grieved for him;\r\nI was grieved for the overthrow of all our air-built castles: but, with\r\nthe elasticity of youth, I soon recovered the shock.\r\n\r\nThough riches had charms, poverty had no terrors for an inexperienced\r\ngirl like me. Indeed, to say the truth, there was something\r\nexhilarating in the idea of being driven to straits, and thrown upon\r\nour own resources. I only wished papa, mamma, and Mary were all of the\r\nsame mind as myself; and then, instead of lamenting past calamities we\r\nmight all cheerfully set to work to remedy them; and the greater the\r\ndifficulties, the harder our present privations, the greater should be\r\nour cheerfulness to endure the latter, and our vigour to contend\r\nagainst the former.\r\n\r\nMary did not lament, but she brooded continually over the misfortune,\r\nand sank into a state of dejection from which no effort of mine could\r\nrouse her. I could not possibly bring her to regard the matter on its\r\nbright side as I did: and indeed I was so fearful of being charged with\r\nchildish frivolity, or stupid insensibility, that I carefully kept most\r\nof my bright ideas and cheering notions to myself; well knowing they\r\ncould not be appreciated.\r\n\r\nMy mother thought only of consoling my father, and paying our debts and\r\nretrenching our expenditure by every available means; but my father was\r\ncompletely overwhelmed by the calamity: health, strength, and spirits\r\nsank beneath the blow, and he never wholly recovered them. In vain my\r\nmother strove to cheer him, by appealing to his piety, to his courage,\r\nto his affection for herself and us. That very affection was his\r\ngreatest torment: it was for our sakes he had so ardently longed to\r\nincrease his fortune\xe2\x80\x94it was our interest that had lent such brightness\r\nto his hopes, and that imparted such bitterness to his present\r\ndistress. He now tormented himself with remorse at having neglected my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s advice; which would at least have saved him from the\r\nadditional burden of debt\xe2\x80\x94he vainly reproached himself for having\r\nbrought her from the dignity, the ease, the luxury of her former\r\nstation to toil with him through the cares and toils of poverty. It was\r\ngall and wormwood to his soul to see that splendid, highly-accomplished\r\nwoman, once so courted and admired, transformed into an active managing\r\nhousewife, with hands and head continually occupied with household\r\nlabours and household economy. The very willingness with which she\r\nperformed these duties, the cheerfulness with which she bore her\r\nreverses, and the kindness which withheld her from imputing the\r\nsmallest blame to him, were all perverted by this ingenious\r\nself-tormentor into further aggravations of his sufferings. And thus\r\nthe mind preyed upon the body, and disordered the system of the nerves,\r\nand they in turn increased the troubles of the mind, till by action and\r\nreaction his health was seriously impaired; and not one of us could\r\nconvince him that the aspect of our affairs was not half so gloomy, so\r\nutterly hopeless, as his morbid imagination represented it to be.\r\n\r\nThe useful pony phaeton was sold, together with the stout, well-fed\r\npony\xe2\x80\x94the old favourite that we had fully determined should end its days\r\nin peace, and never pass from our hands; the little coach-house and\r\nstable were let; the servant boy, and the more efficient (being the\r\nmore expensive) of the two maid-servants, were dismissed. Our clothes\r\nwere mended, turned, and darned to the utmost verge of decency; our\r\nfood, always plain, was now simplified to an unprecedented\r\ndegree\xe2\x80\x94except my father\xe2\x80\x99s favourite dishes; our coals and candles were\r\npainfully economized\xe2\x80\x94the pair of candles reduced to one, and that most\r\nsparingly used; the coals carefully husbanded in the half-empty grate:\r\nespecially when my father was out on his parish duties, or confined to\r\nbed through illness\xe2\x80\x94then we sat with our feet on the fender, scraping\r\nthe perishing embers together from time to time, and occasionally\r\nadding a slight scattering of the dust and fragments of coal, just to\r\nkeep them alive. As for our carpets, they in time were worn threadbare,\r\nand patched and darned even to a greater extent than our garments. To\r\nsave the expense of a gardener, Mary and I undertook to keep the garden\r\nin order; and all the cooking and household work that could not easily\r\nbe managed by one servant-girl, was done by my mother and sister, with\r\na little occasional help from me: only a little, because, though a\r\nwoman in my own estimation, I was still a child in theirs; and my\r\nmother, like most active, managing women, was not gifted with very\r\nactive daughters: for this reason\xe2\x80\x94that being so clever and diligent\r\nherself, she was never tempted to trust her affairs to a deputy, but,\r\non the contrary, was willing to act and think for others as well as for\r\nnumber one; and whatever was the business in hand, she was apt to think\r\nthat no one could do it so well as herself: so that whenever I offered\r\nto assist her, I received such an answer as\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, love, you cannot\r\nindeed\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here you can do. Go and help your sister, or get\r\nher to take a walk with you\xe2\x80\x94tell her she must not sit so much, and stay\r\nso constantly in the house as she does\xe2\x80\x94she may well look thin and\r\ndejected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary, mamma says I\xe2\x80\x99m to help you; or get you to take a walk with me;\r\nshe says you may well look thin and dejected, if you sit so constantly\r\nin the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp me you cannot, Agnes; and I cannot go out with _you_\xe2\x80\x94I have far\r\ntoo much to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let me help you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot, indeed, dear child. Go and practise your music, or play\r\nwith the kitten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was always plenty of sewing on hand; but I had not been taught to\r\ncut out a single garment, and except plain hemming and seaming, there\r\nwas little I could do, even in that line; for they both asserted that\r\nit was far easier to do the work themselves than to prepare it for me:\r\nand besides, they liked better to see me prosecuting my studies, or\r\namusing myself\xe2\x80\x94it was time enough for me to sit bending over my work,\r\nlike a grave matron, when my favourite little pussy was become a steady\r\nold cat. Under such circumstances, although I was not many degrees more\r\nuseful than the kitten, my idleness was not entirely without excuse.\r\n\r\nThrough all our troubles, I never but once heard my mother complain of\r\nour want of money. As summer was coming on she observed to Mary and me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a desirable thing it would be for your papa to spend a few weeks\r\nat a watering-place. I am convinced the sea-air and the change of scene\r\nwould be of incalculable service to him. But then, you see, there\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\nmoney,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a sigh. We both wished exceedingly that the\r\nthing might be done, and lamented greatly that it could not. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nwell!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no use complaining. Possibly something might be\r\ndone to further the project after all. Mary, you are a beautiful\r\ndrawer. What do you say to doing a few more pictures in your best\r\nstyle, and getting them framed, with the water-coloured drawings you\r\nhave already done, and trying to dispose of them to some liberal\r\npicture-dealer, who has the sense to discern their merits?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I should be delighted if you think they _could_ be sold; and\r\nfor anything worth while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth while trying, however, my dear: do you procure the\r\ndrawings, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll endeavour to find a purchaser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish _I_ could do something,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou, Agnes! well, who knows? You draw pretty well, too: if you choose\r\nsome simple piece for your subject, I daresay you will be able to\r\nproduce something we shall all be proud to exhibit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have another scheme in my head, mamma, and have had long, only I\r\ndid not like to mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! pray tell us what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to be a governess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mother uttered an exclamation of surprise, and laughed. My sister\r\ndropped her work in astonishment, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9c_You_ a governess,\r\nAgnes! What can you be dreaming of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything so _very_ extraordinary in it. I do not\r\npretend to be able to instruct great girls; but surely I could teach\r\nlittle ones: and I should like it so much: I am so fond of children. Do\r\nlet me, mamma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my love, you have not learned to take care of _yourself _yet: and\r\nyoung children require more judgment and experience to manage than\r\nelder ones.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, mamma, I am above eighteen, and quite able to take care of\r\nmyself, and others too. You do not know half the wisdom and prudence I\r\npossess, because I have never been tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat would you do in a house full of\r\nstrangers, without me or mamma to speak and act for you\xe2\x80\x94with a parcel\r\nof children, besides yourself, to attend to; and no one to look to for\r\nadvice? You would not even know what clothes to put on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think, because I always do as you bid me, I have no judgment of my\r\nown: but only try me\xe2\x80\x94that is all I ask\xe2\x80\x94and you shall see what I can\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that moment my father entered and the subject of our discussion was\r\nexplained to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my little Agnes a governess!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, and, in spite of his\r\ndejection, he laughed at the idea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, papa, don\xe2\x80\x99t _you_ say anything against it: I should like it so\r\nmuch; and I am sure I could manage delightfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my darling, we could not spare you.\xe2\x80\x9d And a tear glistened in his\r\neye as he added\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! afflicted as we are, surely we are not brought\r\nto that pass yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no necessity whatever for such a\r\nstep; it is merely a whim of her own. So you must hold your tongue, you\r\nnaughty girl; for, though you are so ready to leave us, you know very\r\nwell we cannot part with _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was silenced for that day, and for many succeeding ones; but still I\r\ndid not wholly relinquish my darling scheme. Mary got her drawing\r\nmaterials, and steadily set to work. I got mine too; but while I drew,\r\nI thought of other things. How delightful it would be to be a\r\ngoverness! To go out into the world; to enter upon a new life; to act\r\nfor myself; to exercise my unused faculties; to try my unknown powers;\r\nto earn my own maintenance, and something to comfort and help my\r\nfather, mother, and sister, besides exonerating them from the provision\r\nof my food and clothing; to show papa what his little Agnes could do;\r\nto convince mamma and Mary that I was not quite the helpless,\r\nthoughtless being they supposed. And then, how charming to be entrusted\r\nwith the care and education of children! Whatever others said, I felt I\r\nwas fully competent to the task: the clear remembrance of my own\r\nthoughts in early childhood would be a surer guide than the\r\ninstructions of the most mature adviser. I had but to turn from my\r\nlittle pupils to myself at their age, and I should know, at once, how\r\nto win their confidence and affections: how to waken the contrition of\r\nthe erring; how to embolden the timid and console the afflicted; how to\r\nmake Virtue practicable, Instruction desirable, and Religion lovely and\r\ncomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Delightful task!\r\nTo teach the young idea how to shoot!\r\n\r\n\r\nTo train the tender plants, and watch their buds unfolding day by day!\r\n\r\nInfluenced by so many inducements, I determined still to persevere;\r\nthough the fear of displeasing my mother, or distressing my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings, prevented me from resuming the subject for several days. At\r\nlength, again, I mentioned it to my mother in private; and, with some\r\ndifficulty, got her to promise to assist me with her endeavours. My\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s reluctant consent was next obtained, and then, though Mary\r\nstill sighed her disapproval, my dear, kind mother began to look out\r\nfor a situation for me. She wrote to my father\xe2\x80\x99s relations, and\r\nconsulted the newspaper advertisements\xe2\x80\x94her own relations she had long\r\ndropped all communication with: a formal interchange of occasional\r\nletters was all she had ever had since her marriage, and she would not\r\nat any time have applied to them in a case of this nature. But so long\r\nand so entire had been my parents\xe2\x80\x99 seclusion from the world, that many\r\nweeks elapsed before a suitable situation could be procured. At last,\r\nto my great joy, it was decreed that I should take charge of the young\r\nfamily of a certain Mrs. Bloomfield; whom my kind, prim aunt Grey had\r\nknown in her youth, and asserted to be a very nice woman. Her husband\r\nwas a retired tradesman, who had realized a very comfortable fortune;\r\nbut could not be prevailed upon to give a greater salary than\r\ntwenty-five pounds to the instructress of his children. I, however, was\r\nglad to accept this, rather than refuse the situation\xe2\x80\x94which my parents\r\nwere inclined to think the better plan.\r\n\r\nBut some weeks more were yet to be devoted to preparation. How long,\r\nhow tedious those weeks appeared to me! Yet they were happy ones in the\r\nmain\xe2\x80\x94full of bright hopes and ardent expectations. With what peculiar\r\npleasure I assisted at the making of my new clothes, and, subsequently,\r\nthe packing of my trunks! But there was a feeling of bitterness\r\nmingling with the latter occupation too; and when it was done\xe2\x80\x94when all\r\nwas ready for my departure on the morrow, and the last night at home\r\napproached\xe2\x80\x94a sudden anguish seemed to swell my heart. My dear friends\r\nlooked so sad, and spoke so very kindly, that I could scarcely keep my\r\neyes from overflowing: but I still affected to be gay. I had taken my\r\nlast ramble with Mary on the moors, my last walk in the garden, and\r\nround the house; I had fed, with her, our pet pigeons for the last\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94the pretty creatures that we had tamed to peck their food from our\r\nhands: I had given a farewell stroke to all their silky backs as they\r\ncrowded in my lap. I had tenderly kissed my own peculiar favourites,\r\nthe pair of snow-white fantails; I had played my last tune on the old\r\nfamiliar piano, and sung my last song to papa: not the last, I hoped,\r\nbut the last for what appeared to me a very long time. And, perhaps,\r\nwhen I did these things again it would be with different feelings:\r\ncircumstances might be changed, and this house might never be my\r\nsettled home again. My dear little friend, the kitten, would certainly\r\nbe changed: she was already growing a fine cat; and when I returned,\r\neven for a hasty visit at Christmas, would, most likely, have forgotten\r\nboth her playmate and her merry pranks. I had romped with her for the\r\nlast time; and when I stroked her soft bright fur, while she lay\r\npurring herself to sleep in my lap, it was with a feeling of sadness I\r\ncould not easily disguise. Then at bed-time, when I retired with Mary\r\nto our quiet little chamber, where already my drawers were cleared out\r\nand my share of the bookcase was empty\xe2\x80\x94and where, hereafter, she would\r\nhave to sleep alone, in dreary solitude, as she expressed it\xe2\x80\x94my heart\r\nsank more than ever: I felt as if I had been selfish and wrong to\r\npersist in leaving her; and when I knelt once more beside our little\r\nbed, I prayed for a blessing on her and on my parents more fervently\r\nthan ever I had done before. To conceal my emotion, I buried my face in\r\nmy hands, and they were presently bathed in tears. I perceived, on\r\nrising, that she had been crying too: but neither of us spoke; and in\r\nsilence we betook ourselves to our repose, creeping more closely\r\ntogether from the consciousness that we were to part so soon.\r\n\r\nBut the morning brought a renewal of hope and spirits. I was to depart\r\nearly; that the conveyance which took me (a gig, hired from Mr. Smith,\r\nthe draper, grocer, and tea-dealer of the village) might return the\r\nsame day. I rose, washed, dressed, swallowed a hasty breakfast,\r\nreceived the fond embraces of my father, mother, and sister, kissed the\r\ncat\xe2\x80\x94to the great scandal of Sally, the maid\xe2\x80\x94shook hands with her,\r\nmounted the gig, drew my veil over my face, and then, but not till\r\nthen, burst into a flood of tears. The gig rolled on; I looked back; my\r\ndear mother and sister were still standing at the door, looking after\r\nme, and waving their adieux. I returned their salute, and prayed God to\r\nbless them from my heart: we descended the hill, and I could see them\r\nno more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a coldish mornin\xe2\x80\x99 for you, Miss Agnes,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Smith; \xe2\x80\x9cand a\r\ndarksome \xe2\x80\x99un too; but we\xe2\x80\x99s happen get to yon spot afore there come much\r\nrain to signify.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, as calmly as I could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s comed a good sup last night too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this cold wind will happen keep it off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere ended our colloquy. We crossed the valley, and began to ascend the\r\nopposite hill. As we were toiling up, I looked back again; there was\r\nthe village spire, and the old grey parsonage beyond it, basking in a\r\nslanting beam of sunshine\xe2\x80\x94it was but a sickly ray, but the village and\r\nsurrounding hills were all in sombre shade, and I hailed the wandering\r\nbeam as a propitious omen to my home. With clasped hands I fervently\r\nimplored a blessing on its inhabitants, and hastily turned away; for I\r\nsaw the sunshine was departing; and I carefully avoided another glance,\r\nlest I should see it in gloomy shadow, like the rest of the landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nFIRST LESSONS IN THE ART OF INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we drove along, my spirits revived again, and I turned, with\r\npleasure, to the contemplation of the new life upon which I was\r\nentering. But though it was not far past the middle of September, the\r\nheavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to render the day\r\nextremely cold and dreary; and the journey seemed a very long one, for,\r\nas Smith observed, the roads were \xe2\x80\x9cvery heavy\xe2\x80\x9d; and certainly, his\r\nhorse was very heavy too: it crawled up the hills, and crept down them,\r\nand only condescended to shake its sides in a trot where the road was\r\nat a dead level or a very gentle slope, which was rarely the case in\r\nthose rugged regions; so that it was nearly one o\xe2\x80\x99clock before we\r\nreached the place of our destination. Yet, after all, when we entered\r\nthe lofty iron gateway, when we drove softly up the smooth, well-rolled\r\ncarriage-road, with the green lawn on each side, studded with young\r\ntrees, and approached the new but stately mansion of Wellwood, rising\r\nabove its mushroom poplar-groves, my heart failed me, and I wished it\r\nwere a mile or two farther off. For the first time in my life I must\r\nstand alone: there was no retreating now. I must enter that house, and\r\nintroduce myself among its strange inhabitants. But how was it to be\r\ndone? True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to my retired life and the\r\nprotecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that many a girl\r\nof fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and\r\ngreater ease and self-possession, than I was. Yet, if Mrs. Bloomfield\r\nwere a kind, motherly woman, I might do very well, after all; and the\r\nchildren, of course, I should soon be at ease with them\xe2\x80\x94and Mr.\r\nBloomfield, I hoped, I should have but little to do with.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe calm, be calm, whatever happens,\xe2\x80\x9d I said within myself; and truly I\r\nkept this resolution so well, and was so fully occupied in steadying my\r\nnerves and stifling the rebellious flutter of my heart, that when I was\r\nadmitted into the hall and ushered into the presence of Mrs.\r\nBloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite salutation; and it\r\nafterwards struck me, that the little I did say was spoken in the tone\r\nof one half-dead or half-asleep. The lady, too, was somewhat chilly in\r\nher manner, as I discovered when I had time to reflect. She was a tall,\r\nspare, stately woman, with thick black hair, cold grey eyes, and\r\nextremely sallow complexion.\r\n\r\nWith due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me\r\nthere to take a little refreshment. I was somewhat dismayed at my\r\nappearance on looking in the glass: the cold wind had swelled and\r\nreddened my hands, uncurled and entangled my hair, and dyed my face of\r\na pale purple; add to this my collar was horridly crumpled, my frock\r\nsplashed with mud, my feet clad in stout new boots, and as the trunks\r\nwere not brought up, there was no remedy; so having smoothed my hair as\r\nwell as I could, and repeatedly twitched my obdurate collar, I\r\nproceeded to clomp down the two flights of stairs, philosophizing as I\r\nwent; and with some difficulty found my way into the room where Mrs.\r\nBloomfield awaited me.\r\n\r\nShe led me into the dining-room, where the family luncheon had been\r\nlaid out. Some beefsteaks and half-cold potatoes were set before me;\r\nand while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I\r\nthought) and endeavouring to sustain something like a\r\nconversation\xe2\x80\x94consisting chiefly of a succession of commonplace remarks,\r\nexpressed with frigid formality: but this might be more my fault than\r\nhers, for I really could _not_ converse. In fact, my attention was\r\nalmost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from ravenous appetite, but\r\nfrom distress at the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of\r\nmy hands, almost palsied by their five-hours\xe2\x80\x99 exposure to the bitter\r\nwind. I would gladly have eaten the potatoes and let the meat alone,\r\nbut having got a large piece of the latter on to my plate, I could not\r\nbe so impolite as to leave it; so, after many awkward and unsuccessful\r\nattempts to cut it with the knife, or tear it with the fork, or pull it\r\nasunder between them, sensible that the awful lady was a spectator to\r\nthe whole transaction, I at last desperately grasped the knife and fork\r\nin my fists, like a child of two years old, and fell to work with all\r\nthe little strength I possessed. But this needed some apology\xe2\x80\x94with a\r\nfeeble attempt at a laugh, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy hands are so benumbed with the\r\ncold that I can scarcely handle my knife and fork.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI daresay you would find it cold,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she with a cool, immutable\r\ngravity that did not serve to reassure me.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony was concluded, she led me into the sitting-room\r\nagain, where she rang and sent for the children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will find them not very far advanced in their attainments,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have had so little time to attend to their education\r\nmyself, and we have thought them too young for a governess till now;\r\nbut I think they are clever children, and very apt to learn, especially\r\nthe little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock\xe2\x80\x94a generous,\r\nnoble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for\r\nalways speaking the truth. He seems to scorn deception\xe2\x80\x9d (this was good\r\nnews). \xe2\x80\x9cHis sister Mary Ann will require watching,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nshe is a very good girl upon the whole; though I wish her to be kept\r\nout of the nursery as much as possible, as she is now almost six years\r\nold, and might acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her\r\ncrib to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to\r\noverlook her washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she\r\nneed have nothing further to do with the nursery maid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment my young\r\npupils entered the apartment, with their two younger sisters. Master\r\nTom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven, with a somewhat wiry\r\nframe, flaxen hair, blue eyes, small turned-up nose, and fair\r\ncomplexion. Mary Ann was a tall girl too, somewhat dark like her\r\nmother, but with a round full face and a high colour in her cheeks. The\r\nsecond sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl; Mrs. Bloomfield\r\nassured me she was a remarkably gentle child, and required\r\nencouragement: she had not learned anything yet; but in a few days, she\r\nwould be four years old, and then she might take her first lesson in\r\nthe alphabet, and be promoted to the schoolroom. The remaining one was\r\nHarriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two,\r\nthat I coveted more than all the rest\xe2\x80\x94but with her I had nothing to do.\r\n\r\nI talked to my little pupils as well as I could, and tried to render\r\nmyself agreeable; but with little success I fear, for their mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence kept me under an unpleasant restraint. They, however, were\r\nremarkably free from shyness. They seemed bold, lively children, and I\r\nhoped I should soon be on friendly terms with them\xe2\x80\x94the little boy\r\nespecially, of whom I had heard such a favourable character from his\r\nmamma. In Mary Ann there was a certain affected simper, and a craving\r\nfor notice, that I was sorry to observe. But her brother claimed all my\r\nattention to himself; he stood bolt upright between me and the fire,\r\nwith his hands behind his back, talking away like an orator,\r\noccasionally interrupting his discourse with a sharp reproof to his\r\nsisters when they made too much noise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tom, what a darling you are!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his mother. \xe2\x80\x9cCome and kiss\r\ndear mamma; and then won\xe2\x80\x99t you show Miss Grey your schoolroom, and your\r\nnice new books?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t kiss _you_, mamma; but I _will_ show Miss Grey my schoolroom,\r\nand my new books.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _my_ schoolroom, and _my_ new books, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Ann. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmine too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re _mine_,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he decisively. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along, Miss Grey\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nescort you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the room and books had been shown, with some bickerings between\r\nthe brother and sister that I did my utmost to appease or mitigate,\r\nMary Ann brought me her doll, and began to be very loquacious on the\r\nsubject of its fine clothes, its bed, its chest of drawers, and other\r\nappurtenances; but Tom told her to hold her clamour, that Miss Grey\r\nmight see his rocking-horse, which, with a most important bustle, he\r\ndragged forth from its corner into the middle of the room, loudly\r\ncalling on me to attend to it. Then, ordering his sister to hold the\r\nreins, he mounted, and made me stand for ten minutes, watching how\r\nmanfully he used his whip and spurs. Meantime, however, I admired Mary\r\nAnn\xe2\x80\x99s pretty doll, and all its possessions; and then told Master Tom he\r\nwas a capital rider, but I hoped he would not use his whip and spurs so\r\nmuch when he rode a real pony.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I will!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laying on with redoubled ardour. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll cut\r\ninto him like smoke! Eeh! my word! but he shall sweat for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was very shocking; but I hoped in time to be able to work a\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you must put on your bonnet and shawl,\xe2\x80\x9d said the little hero, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you my garden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd _mine_,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Ann.\r\n\r\nTom lifted his fist with a menacing gesture; she uttered a loud, shrill\r\nscream, ran to the other side of me, and made a face at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely, Tom, you would not strike your sister! I hope I shall _never_\r\nsee you do that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will sometimes: I\xe2\x80\x99m obliged to do it now and then to keep her in\r\norder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not your business to keep her in order, you know\xe2\x80\x94that is\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now go and put on your bonnet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94it is so very cloudy and cold, it seems likely to\r\nrain;\xe2\x80\x94and you know I have had a long drive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter\xe2\x80\x94you _must_ come; I shall allow of no excuses,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\nconsequential little gentleman. And, as it was the first day of our\r\nacquaintance, I thought I might as well indulge him. It was too cold\r\nfor Mary Ann to venture, so she stayed with her mamma, to the great\r\nrelief of her brother, who liked to have me all to himself.\r\n\r\nThe garden was a large one, and tastefully laid out; besides several\r\nsplendid dahlias, there were some other fine flowers still in bloom:\r\nbut my companion would not give me time to examine them: I must go with\r\nhim, across the wet grass, to a remote sequestered corner, the most\r\nimportant place in the grounds, because it contained _his_ garden.\r\nThere were two round beds, stocked with a variety of plants. In one\r\nthere was a pretty little rose-tree. I paused to admire its lovely\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind that!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s only _Mary\r\nAnn\xe2\x80\x99s_ garden; look, THIS is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter I had observed every flower, and listened to a disquisition on\r\nevery plant, I was permitted to depart; but first, with great pomp, he\r\nplucked a polyanthus and presented it to me, as one conferring a\r\nprodigious favour. I observed, on the grass about his garden, certain\r\napparatus of sticks and corn, and asked what they were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTraps for birds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you catch them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa says they do harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you do with them when you catch them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDifferent things. Sometimes I give them to the cat; sometimes I cut\r\nthem in pieces with my penknife; but the next, I mean to roast alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor two reasons: first, to see how long it will live\xe2\x80\x94and then, to see\r\nwhat it will taste like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it is extremely wicked to do such things? Remember,\r\nthe birds can feel as well as you; and think, how would you like it\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing! I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bird, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t feel what I do to\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will have to feel it some time, Tom: you have heard where\r\nwicked people go to when they die; and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave off torturing\r\ninnocent birds, remember, you will have to go there, and suffer just\r\nwhat you have made them suffer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, pooh! I shan\xe2\x80\x99t. Papa knows how I treat them, and he never blames\r\nme for it: he says it is just what _he_ used to do when _he_ was a boy.\r\nLast summer, he gave me a nest full of young sparrows, and he saw me\r\npulling off their legs and wings, and heads, and never said anything;\r\nexcept that they were nasty things, and I must not let them soil my\r\ntrousers: and Uncle Robson was there too, and he laughed, and said I\r\nwas a fine boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what would your mamma say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care! she says it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity to kill the pretty singing\r\nbirds, but the naughty sparrows, and mice, and rats, I may do what I\r\nlike with. So now, Miss Grey, you see it is _not_ wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still think it is, Tom; and perhaps your papa and mamma would think\r\nso too, if they thought much about it. However,\xe2\x80\x9d I internally added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey may say what they please, but I am determined you shall do\r\nnothing of the kind, as long as I have power to prevent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe next took me across the lawn to see his mole-traps, and then into\r\nthe stack-yard to see his weasel-traps: one of which, to his great joy,\r\ncontained a dead weasel; and then into the stable to see, not the fine\r\ncarriage-horses, but a little rough colt, which he informed me had been\r\nbred on purpose for him, and he was to ride it as soon as it was\r\nproperly trained. I tried to amuse the little fellow, and listened to\r\nall his chatter as complacently as I could; for I thought if he had any\r\naffections at all, I would endeavour to win them; and then, in time, I\r\nmight be able to show him the error of his ways: but I looked in vain\r\nfor that generous, noble spirit his mother talked of; though I could\r\nsee he was not without a certain degree of quickness and penetration,\r\nwhen he chose to exert it.\r\n\r\nWhen we re-entered the house it was nearly tea-time. Master Tom told me\r\nthat, as papa was from home, he and I and Mary Ann were to have tea\r\nwith mamma, for a treat; for, on such occasions, she always dined at\r\nluncheon-time with them, instead of at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Soon after tea,\r\nMary Ann went to bed, but Tom favoured us with his company and\r\nconversation till eight. After he was gone, Mrs. Bloomfield further\r\nenlightened me on the subject of her children\xe2\x80\x99s dispositions and\r\nacquirements, and on what they were to learn, and how they were to be\r\nmanaged, and cautioned me to mention their defects to no one but\r\nherself. My mother had warned me before to mention them as little as\r\npossible to _her_, for people did not like to be told of their\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x99s faults, and so I concluded I was to keep silence on them\r\naltogether. About half-past nine, Mrs. Bloomfield invited me to partake\r\nof a frugal supper of cold meat and bread. I was glad when that was\r\nover, and she took her bedroom candlestick and retired to rest; for\r\nthough I wished to be pleased with her, her company was extremely\r\nirksome to me; and I could not help feeling that she was cold, grave,\r\nand forbidding\xe2\x80\x94the very opposite of the kind, warm-hearted matron my\r\nhopes had depicted her to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nA FEW MORE LESSONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI rose next morning with a feeling of hopeful exhilaration, in spite of\r\nthe disappointments already experienced; but I found the dressing of\r\nMary Ann was no light matter, as her abundant hair was to be smeared\r\nwith pomade, plaited in three long tails, and tied with bows of ribbon:\r\na task my unaccustomed fingers found great difficulty in performing.\r\nShe told me her nurse could do it in half the time, and, by keeping up\r\na constant fidget of impatience, contrived to render me still longer.\r\nWhen all was done, we went into the schoolroom, where I met my other\r\npupil, and chatted with the two till it was time to go down to\r\nbreakfast. That meal being concluded, and a few civil words having been\r\nexchanged with Mrs. Bloomfield, we repaired to the schoolroom again,\r\nand commenced the business of the day. I found my pupils very backward,\r\nindeed; but Tom, though averse to every species of mental exertion, was\r\nnot without abilities. Mary Ann could scarcely read a word, and was so\r\ncareless and inattentive that I could hardly get on with her at all.\r\nHowever, by dint of great labour and patience, I managed to get\r\nsomething done in the course of the morning, and then accompanied my\r\nyoung charge out into the garden and adjacent grounds, for a little\r\nrecreation before dinner. There we got along tolerably together, except\r\nthat I found they had no notion of going with me: I must go with them,\r\nwherever they chose to lead me. I must run, walk, or stand, exactly as\r\nit suited their fancy. This, I thought, was reversing the order of\r\nthings; and I found it doubly disagreeable, as on this as well as\r\nsubsequent occasions, they seemed to prefer the dirtiest places and the\r\nmost dismal occupations. But there was no remedy; either I must follow\r\nthem, or keep entirely apart from them, and thus appear neglectful of\r\nmy charge. To-day, they manifested a particular attachment to a well at\r\nthe bottom of the lawn, where they persisted in dabbling with sticks\r\nand pebbles for above half an hour. I was in constant fear that their\r\nmother would see them from the window, and blame me for allowing them\r\nthus to draggle their clothes and wet their feet and hands, instead of\r\ntaking exercise; but no arguments, commands, or entreaties could draw\r\nthem away. If _she_ did not see them, some one else did\xe2\x80\x94a gentleman on\r\nhorseback had entered the gate and was proceeding up the road; at the\r\ndistance of a few paces from us he paused, and calling to the children\r\nin a waspish penetrating tone, bade them \xe2\x80\x9ckeep out of that water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9c(I suppose it _is_ Miss Grey), I am surprised\r\nthat you should allow them to dirty their clothes in that manner! Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see how Miss Bloomfield has soiled her frock? and that Master\r\nBloomfield\xe2\x80\x99s socks are quite wet? and both of them without gloves?\r\nDear, dear! Let me _request_ that in future you will keep them _decent_\r\nat least!\xe2\x80\x9d so saying, he turned away, and continued his ride up to the\r\nhouse. This was Mr. Bloomfield. I was surprised that he should nominate\r\nhis children Master and Miss Bloomfield; and still more so, that he\r\nshould speak so uncivilly to me, their governess, and a perfect\r\nstranger to himself. Presently the bell rang to summon us in. I dined\r\nwith the children at one, while he and his lady took their luncheon at\r\nthe same table. His conduct there did not greatly raise him in my\r\nestimation. He was a man of ordinary stature\xe2\x80\x94rather below than\r\nabove\xe2\x80\x94and rather thin than stout, apparently between thirty and forty\r\nyears of age: he had a large mouth, pale, dingy complexion, milky blue\r\neyes, and hair the colour of a hempen cord. There was a roast leg of\r\nmutton before him: he helped Mrs. Bloomfield, the children, and me,\r\ndesiring me to cut up the children\xe2\x80\x99s meat; then, after twisting about\r\nthe mutton in various directions, and eyeing it from different points,\r\nhe pronounced it not fit to be eaten, and called for the cold beef.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with the mutton, my dear?\xe2\x80\x9d asked his mate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite overdone. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you taste, Mrs. Bloomfield, that all the\r\ngoodness is roasted out of it? And can\xe2\x80\x99t you see that all that nice,\r\nred gravy is completely dried away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think the _beef_ will suit you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe beef was set before him, and he began to carve, but with the most\r\nrueful expressions of discontent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with the _beef_, Mr. Bloomfield? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I thought\r\nit was very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it _was_ very nice. A nicer joint could not be; but it is\r\n_quite_ spoiled,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, dolefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so! Why, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see how it is cut? Dear\xe2\x80\x94dear! it is quite\r\nshocking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must have cut it wrong in the kitchen, then, for I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\r\ncarved it quite properly here, yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo _doubt_ they cut it wrong in the kitchen\xe2\x80\x94the savages! Dear\xe2\x80\x94dear!\r\nDid ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely ruined?\r\nBut remember that, in future, when a decent dish leaves this table,\r\nthey shall not _touch_ it in the kitchen. Remember _that_, Mrs.\r\nBloomfield!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the ruinous state of the beef, the gentleman managed to\r\ncut himself some delicate slices, part of which he ate in silence. When\r\nhe next spoke, it was, in a less querulous tone, to ask what there was\r\nfor dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurkey and grouse,\xe2\x80\x9d was the concise reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what besides?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of fish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_You don\xe2\x80\x99t know_?\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, looking solemnly up from his plate, and\r\nsuspending his knife and fork in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I told the cook to get some fish\xe2\x80\x94I did not particularize what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that beats everything! A lady professes to keep house, and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know what fish is for dinner! professes to order fish, and\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t specify what!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, Mr. Bloomfield, you will order dinner yourself in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing more was said; and I was very glad to get out of the room with\r\nmy pupils; for I never felt so ashamed and uncomfortable in my life for\r\nanything that was not my own fault.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we applied to lessons again: then went out again; then\r\nhad tea in the schoolroom; then I dressed Mary Ann for dessert; and\r\nwhen she and her brother had gone down to the dining-room, I took the\r\nopportunity of beginning a letter to my dear friends at home: but the\r\nchildren came up before I had half completed it. At seven I had to put\r\nMary Ann to bed; then I played with Tom till eight, when he, too, went;\r\nand I finished my letter and unpacked my clothes, which I had hitherto\r\nfound no opportunity for doing, and, finally, went to bed myself.\r\n\r\nBut this is a very favourable specimen of a day\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings.\r\n\r\nMy task of instruction and surveillance, instead of becoming easier as\r\nmy charges and I got better accustomed to each other, became more\r\narduous as their characters unfolded. The name of governess, I soon\r\nfound, was a mere mockery as applied to me: my pupils had no more\r\nnotion of obedience than a wild, unbroken colt. The habitual fear of\r\ntheir father\xe2\x80\x99s peevish temper, and the dread of the punishments he was\r\nwont to inflict when irritated, kept them generally within bounds in\r\nhis immediate presence. The girls, too, had some fear of their mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanger; and the boy might occasionally be bribed to do as she bid him by\r\nthe hope of reward; but I had no rewards to offer; and as for\r\npunishments, I was given to understand, the parents reserved that\r\nprivilege to themselves; and yet they expected me to keep my pupils in\r\norder. Other children might be guided by the fear of anger and the\r\ndesire of approbation; but neither the one nor the other had any effect\r\nupon these.\r\n\r\nMaster Tom, not content with refusing to be ruled, must needs set up as\r\na ruler, and manifested a determination to keep, not only his sisters,\r\nbut his governess in order, by violent manual and pedal applications;\r\nand, as he was a tall, strong boy of his years, this occasioned no\r\ntrifling inconvenience. A few sound boxes on the ear, on such\r\noccasions, might have settled the matter easily enough: but as, in that\r\ncase, he might make up some story to his mother which she would be sure\r\nto believe, as she had such unshaken faith in his veracity\xe2\x80\x94though I had\r\nalready discovered it to be by no means unimpeachable\xe2\x80\x94I determined to\r\nrefrain from striking him, even in self-defence; and, in his most\r\nviolent moods, my only resource was to throw him on his back and hold\r\nhis hands and feet till the frenzy was somewhat abated. To the\r\ndifficulty of preventing him from doing what he ought not, was added\r\nthat of forcing him to do what he ought. Often he would positively\r\nrefuse to learn, or to repeat his lessons, or even to look at his book.\r\nHere, again, a good birch rod might have been serviceable; but, as my\r\npowers were so limited, I must make the best use of what I had.\r\n\r\nAs there were no settled hours for study and play, I resolved to give\r\nmy pupils a certain task, which, with moderate attention, they could\r\nperform in a short time; and till this was done, however weary I was,\r\nor however perverse they might be, nothing short of parental\r\ninterference should induce me to suffer them to leave the schoolroom,\r\neven if I should sit with my chair against the door to keep them in.\r\nPatience, Firmness, and Perseverance were my only weapons; and these I\r\nresolved to use to the utmost. I determined always strictly to fulfil\r\nthe threats and promises I made; and, to that end, I must be cautious\r\nto threaten and promise nothing that I could not perform. Then, I would\r\ncarefully refrain from all useless irritability and indulgence of my\r\nown ill-temper: when they behaved tolerably, I would be as kind and\r\nobliging as it was in my power to be, in order to make the widest\r\npossible distinction between good and bad conduct; I would reason with\r\nthem, too, in the simplest and most effective manner. When I reproved\r\nthem, or refused to gratify their wishes, after a glaring fault, it\r\nshould be more in sorrow than in anger: their little hymns and prayers\r\nI would make plain and clear to their understanding; when they said\r\ntheir prayers at night and asked pardon for their offences, I would\r\nremind them of the sins of the past day, solemnly, but in perfect\r\nkindness, to avoid raising a spirit of opposition; penitential hymns\r\nshould be said by the naughty, cheerful ones by the comparatively good;\r\nand every kind of instruction I would convey to them, as much as\r\npossible, by entertaining discourse\xe2\x80\x94apparently with no other object\r\nthan their present amusement in view.\r\n\r\nBy these means I hoped in time both to benefit the children and to gain\r\nthe approbation of their parents; and also to convince my friends at\r\nhome that I was not so wanting in skill and prudence as they supposed.\r\nI knew the difficulties I had to contend with were great; but I knew\r\n(at least I believed) unremitting patience and perseverance could\r\novercome them; and night and morning I implored Divine assistance to\r\nthis end. But either the children were so incorrigible, the parents so\r\nunreasonable, or myself so mistaken in my views, or so unable to carry\r\nthem out, that my best intentions and most strenuous efforts seemed\r\nproductive of no better result than sport to the children,\r\ndissatisfaction to their parents, and torment to myself.\r\n\r\nThe task of instruction was as arduous for the body as the mind. I had\r\nto run after my pupils to catch them, to carry or drag them to the\r\ntable, and often forcibly to hold them there till the lesson was done.\r\nTom I frequently put into a corner, seating myself before him in a\r\nchair, with a book which contained the little task that must be said or\r\nread, before he was released, in my hand. He was not strong enough to\r\npush both me and the chair away, so he would stand twisting his body\r\nand face into the most grotesque and singular contortions\xe2\x80\x94laughable, no\r\ndoubt, to an unconcerned spectator, but not to me\xe2\x80\x94and uttering loud\r\nyells and doleful outcries, intended to represent weeping but wholly\r\nwithout the accompaniment of tears. I knew this was done solely for the\r\npurpose of annoying me; and, therefore, however I might inwardly\r\ntremble with impatience and irritation, I manfully strove to suppress\r\nall visible signs of molestation, and affected to sit with calm\r\nindifference, waiting till it should please him to cease this pastime,\r\nand prepare for a run in the garden, by casting his eye on the book and\r\nreading or repeating the few words he was required to say. Sometimes he\r\nwas determined to do his writing badly; and I had to hold his hand to\r\nprevent him from purposely blotting or disfiguring the paper.\r\nFrequently I threatened that, if he did not do better, he should have\r\nanother line: then he would stubbornly refuse to write this line; and\r\nI, to save my word, had finally to resort to the expedient of holding\r\nhis fingers upon the pen, and forcibly drawing his hand up and down,\r\ntill, in spite of his resistance, the line was in some sort completed.\r\n\r\nYet Tom was by no means the most unmanageable of my pupils: sometimes,\r\nto my great joy, he would have the sense to see that his wisest policy\r\nwas to finish his tasks, and go out and amuse himself till I and his\r\nsisters came to join him; which frequently was not at all, for Mary Ann\r\nseldom followed his example in this particular: she apparently\r\npreferred rolling on the floor to any other amusement: down she would\r\ndrop like a leaden weight; and when I, with great difficulty, had\r\nsucceeded in rooting her thence, I had still to hold her up with one\r\narm, while with the other I held the book from which she was to read or\r\nspell her lesson. As the dead weight of the big girl of six became too\r\nheavy for one arm to bear, I transferred it to the other; or, if both\r\nwere weary of the burden, I carried her into a corner, and told her she\r\nmight come out when she should find the use of her feet, and stand up:\r\nbut she generally preferred lying there like a log till dinner or\r\ntea-time, when, as I could not deprive her of her meals, she must be\r\nliberated, and would come crawling out with a grin of triumph on her\r\nround, red face. Often she would stubbornly refuse to pronounce some\r\nparticular word in her lesson; and now I regret the lost labour I have\r\nhad in striving to conquer her obstinacy. If I had passed it over as a\r\nmatter of no consequence, it would have been better for both parties,\r\nthan vainly striving to overcome it as I did; but I thought it my\r\nabsolute duty to crush this vicious tendency in the bud: and so it was,\r\nif I could have done it; and had my powers been less limited, I might\r\nhave enforced obedience; but, as it was, it was a trial of strength\r\nbetween her and me, in which she generally came off victorious; and\r\nevery victory served to encourage and strengthen her for a future\r\ncontest. In vain I argued, coaxed, entreated, threatened, scolded; in\r\nvain I kept her in from play, or, if obliged to take her out, refused\r\nto play with her, or to speak kindly or have anything to do with her;\r\nin vain I tried to set before her the advantages of doing as she was\r\nbid, and being loved, and kindly treated in consequence, and the\r\ndisadvantages of persisting in her absurd perversity. Sometimes, when\r\nshe would ask me to do something for her, I would answer,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will,\r\nMary Ann, if you will only say that word. Come! you\xe2\x80\x99d better say it at\r\nonce, and have no more trouble about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, of course, I can do nothing for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith me, at her age, or under, neglect and disgrace were the most\r\ndreadful of punishments; but on her they made no impression. Sometimes,\r\nexasperated to the utmost pitch, I would shake her violently by the\r\nshoulder, or pull her long hair, or put her in the corner; for which\r\nshe punished me with loud, shrill, piercing screams, that went through\r\nmy head like a knife. She knew I hated this, and when she had shrieked\r\nher utmost, would look into my face with an air of vindictive\r\nsatisfaction, exclaiming,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_, then! _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ for you!\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nshriek again and again, till I was forced to stop my ears. Often these\r\ndreadful cries would bring Mrs. Bloomfield up to inquire what was the\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary Ann is a naughty girl, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are these shocking screams?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is screaming in a passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never heard such a dreadful noise! You might be killing her. Why is\r\nshe not out with her brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot get her to finish her lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mary Ann must be a _good_ girl, and finish her lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d This was\r\nblandly spoken to the child. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope I shall _never_ hear such\r\nterrible cries again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd fixing her cold, stony eyes upon me with a look that could not be\r\nmistaken, she would shut the door, and walk away. Sometimes I would try\r\nto take the little obstinate creature by surprise, and casually ask her\r\nthe word while she was thinking of something else; frequently she would\r\nbegin to say it, and then suddenly check herself, with a provoking look\r\nthat seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! I\xe2\x80\x99m too sharp for you; you shan\xe2\x80\x99t trick it out\r\nof me, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, I pretended to forget the whole affair; and talked\r\nand played with her as usual, till night, when I put her to bed; then\r\nbending over her, while she lay all smiles and good humour, just before\r\ndeparting, I said, as cheerfully and kindly as before\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mary Ann,\r\njust tell me that word before I kiss you good-night. You are a good\r\ngirl now, and, of course, you will say it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I can\xe2\x80\x99t kiss you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn vain I expressed my sorrow; in vain I lingered for some symptom of\r\ncontrition; she really \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d and I left her alone, and in\r\ndarkness, wondering most of all at this last proof of insensate\r\nstubbornness. In _my_ childhood I could not imagine a more afflictive\r\npunishment than for my mother to refuse to kiss me at night: the very\r\nidea was terrible. More than the idea I never felt, for, happily, I\r\nnever committed a fault that was deemed worthy of such penalty; but\r\nonce I remember, for some transgression of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s, our mother\r\nthought proper to inflict it upon her: what _she_ felt, I cannot tell;\r\nbut my sympathetic tears and suffering for her sake I shall not soon\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nAnother troublesome trait in Mary Ann was her incorrigible propensity\r\nto keep running into the nursery, to play with her little sisters and\r\nthe nurse. This was natural enough, but, as it was against her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpress desire, I, of course, forbade her to do so, and did my utmost\r\nto keep her with me; but that only increased her relish for the\r\nnursery, and the more I strove to keep her out of it, the oftener she\r\nwent, and the longer she stayed, to the great dissatisfaction of Mrs.\r\nBloomfield, who, I well knew, would impute all the blame of the matter\r\nto me. Another of my trials was the dressing in the morning: at one\r\ntime she would not be washed; at another she would not be dressed,\r\nunless she might wear some particular frock, that I knew her mother\r\nwould not like her to have; at another she would scream and run away if\r\nI attempted to touch her hair. So that, frequently, when, after much\r\ntrouble and toil, I had, at length, succeeded in bringing her down, the\r\nbreakfast was nearly half over; and black looks from \xe2\x80\x9cmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d and testy\r\nobservations from \xe2\x80\x9cpapa,\xe2\x80\x9d spoken at me, if not to me, were sure to be\r\nmy meed: for few things irritated the latter so much as want of\r\npunctuality at meal times. Then, among the minor annoyances, was my\r\ninability to satisfy Mrs. Bloomfield with her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s dress; and the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s hair \xe2\x80\x9cwas never fit to be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes, as a powerful\r\nreproach to me, she would perform the office of tire woman herself, and\r\nthen complain bitterly of the trouble it gave her.\r\n\r\nWhen little Fanny came into the schoolroom, I hoped she would be mild\r\nand inoffensive, at least; but a few days, if not a few hours, sufficed\r\nto destroy the illusion: I found her a mischievous, intractable little\r\ncreature, given up to falsehood and deception, young as she was, and\r\nalarmingly fond of exercising her two favourite weapons of offence and\r\ndefence: that of spitting in the faces of those who incurred her\r\ndispleasure, and bellowing like a bull when her unreasonable desires\r\nwere not gratified. As she, generally, was pretty quiet in her parents\xe2\x80\x99\r\npresence, and they were impressed with the notion of her being a\r\nremarkably gentle child, her falsehoods were readily believed, and her\r\nloud uproars led them to suspect harsh and injudicious treatment on my\r\npart; and when, at length, her bad disposition became manifest even to\r\ntheir prejudiced eyes, I felt that the whole was attributed to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a naughty girl Fanny is getting!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Bloomfield would say to\r\nher spouse. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you observe, my dear, how she is altered since she\r\nentered the schoolroom? She will soon be as bad as the other two; and,\r\nI am sorry to say, they have quite deteriorated of late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may say that,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking that same\r\nmyself. I thought when we got them a governess they\xe2\x80\x99d improve; but,\r\ninstead of that, they get worse and worse: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is with\r\ntheir learning, but their habits, I know, make no sort of improvement;\r\nthey get rougher, and dirtier, and more unseemly every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew this was all pointed at me; and these, and all similar\r\ninnuendoes, affected me far more deeply than any open accusations would\r\nhave done; for against the latter I should have been roused to speak in\r\nmy own defence: now I judged it my wisest plan to subdue every\r\nresentful impulse, suppress every sensitive shrinking, and go on\r\nperseveringly, doing my best; for, irksome as my situation was, I\r\nearnestly wished to retain it. I thought, if I could struggle on with\r\nunremitting firmness and integrity, the children would in time become\r\nmore humanized: every month would contribute to make them some little\r\nwiser, and, consequently, more manageable; for a child of nine or ten\r\nas frantic and ungovernable as these at six and seven would be a\r\nmaniac.\r\n\r\nI flattered myself I was benefiting my parents and sister by my\r\ncontinuance here; for small as the salary was, I still was earning\r\nsomething, and with strict economy I could easily manage to have\r\nsomething to spare for them, if they would favour me by taking it. Then\r\nit was by my own will that I had got the place: I had brought all this\r\ntribulation on myself, and I was determined to bear it; nay, more than\r\nthat, I did not even regret the step I had taken. I longed to show my\r\nfriends that, even now, I was competent to undertake the charge, and\r\nable to acquit myself honourably to the end; and if ever I felt it\r\ndegrading to submit so quietly, or intolerable to toil so constantly, I\r\nwould turn towards my home, and say within myself\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThey may crush, but they shall not subdue me!\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis of thee that I think, not of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Christmas I was allowed to visit home; but my holiday was only of\r\na fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s duration: \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Bloomfield, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, as you\r\nhad seen your friends so lately, you would not care for a longer stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI left her to think so still: but she little knew how long, how\r\nwearisome those fourteen weeks of absence had been to me; how intensely\r\nI had longed for my holidays, how greatly I was disappointed at their\r\ncurtailment. Yet she was not to blame in this. I had never told her my\r\nfeelings, and she could not be expected to divine them; I had not been\r\nwith her a full term, and she was justified in not allowing me a full\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nTHE GRANDMAMMA\r\n\r\n\r\nI spare my readers the account of my delight on coming home, my\r\nhappiness while there\xe2\x80\x94enjoying a brief space of rest and liberty in\r\nthat dear, familiar place, among the loving and the loved\xe2\x80\x94and my sorrow\r\non being obliged to bid them, once more, a long adieu.\r\n\r\nI returned, however, with unabated vigour to my work\xe2\x80\x94a more arduous\r\ntask than anyone can imagine, who has not felt something like the\r\nmisery of being charged with the care and direction of a set of\r\nmischievous, turbulent rebels, whom his utmost exertions cannot bind to\r\ntheir duty; while, at the same time, he is responsible for their\r\nconduct to a higher power, who exacts from him what cannot be achieved\r\nwithout the aid of the superior\xe2\x80\x99s more potent authority; which, either\r\nfrom indolence, or the fear of becoming unpopular with the said\r\nrebellious gang, the latter refuses to give. I can conceive few\r\nsituations more harassing than that wherein, however you may long for\r\nsuccess, however you may labour to fulfil your duty, your efforts are\r\nbaffled and set at nought by those beneath you, and unjustly censured\r\nand misjudged by those above.\r\n\r\nI have not enumerated half the vexatious propensities of my pupils, or\r\nhalf the troubles resulting from my heavy responsibilities, for fear of\r\ntrespassing too much upon the reader\xe2\x80\x99s patience; as, perhaps, I have\r\nalready done; but my design in writing the few last pages was not to\r\namuse, but to benefit those whom it might concern; he that has no\r\ninterest in such matters will doubtless have skipped them over with a\r\ncursory glance, and, perhaps, a malediction against the prolixity of\r\nthe writer; but if a parent has, therefrom, gathered any useful hint,\r\nor an unfortunate governess received thereby the slightest benefit, I\r\nam well rewarded for my pains.\r\n\r\nTo avoid trouble and confusion, I have taken my pupils one by one, and\r\ndiscussed their various qualities; but this can give no adequate idea\r\nof being worried by the whole three together; when, as was often the\r\ncase, all were determined to \xe2\x80\x9cbe naughty, and to tease Miss Grey, and\r\nput her in a passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSometimes, on such occasions, the thought has suddenly occurred to\r\nme\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf they could see me now!\xe2\x80\x9d meaning, of course, my friends at home;\r\nand the idea of how they would pity me has made me pity myself\xe2\x80\x94so\r\ngreatly that I have had the utmost difficulty to restrain my tears: but\r\nI have restrained them, till my little tormentors were gone to dessert,\r\nor cleared off to bed (my only prospects of deliverance), and then, in\r\nall the bliss of solitude, I have given myself up to the luxury of an\r\nunrestricted burst of weeping. But this was a weakness I did not often\r\nindulge: my employments were too numerous, my leisure moments too\r\nprecious, to admit of much time being given to fruitless lamentations.\r\n\r\nI particularly remember one wild, snowy afternoon, soon after my return\r\nin January: the children had all come up from dinner, loudly declaring\r\nthat they meant \xe2\x80\x9cto be naughty;\xe2\x80\x9d and they had well kept their\r\nresolution, though I had talked myself hoarse, and wearied every muscle\r\nin my throat, in the vain attempt to reason them out of it. I had got\r\nTom pinned up in a corner, whence, I told him, he should not escape\r\ntill he had done his appointed task. Meantime, Fanny had possessed\r\nherself of my work-bag, and was rifling its contents\xe2\x80\x94and spitting into\r\nit besides. I told her to let it alone, but to no purpose, of course.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurn it, Fanny!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom: and _this_ command she hastened to obey. I\r\nsprang to snatch it from the fire, and Tom darted to the door. \xe2\x80\x9cMary\r\nAnn, throw her desk out of the window!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he: and my precious desk,\r\ncontaining my letters and papers, my small amount of cash, and all my\r\nvaluables, was about to be precipitated from the three-storey window. I\r\nflew to rescue it. Meanwhile Tom had left the room, and was rushing\r\ndown the stairs, followed by Fanny. Having secured my desk, I ran to\r\ncatch them, and Mary Ann came scampering after. All three escaped me,\r\nand ran out of the house into the garden, where they plunged about in\r\nthe snow, shouting and screaming in exultant glee.\r\n\r\nWhat must I do? If I followed them, I should probably be unable to\r\ncapture one, and only drive them farther away; if I did not, how was I\r\nto get them in? And what would their parents think of me, if they saw\r\nor heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless, and\r\nbootless, in the deep soft snow? While I stood in this perplexity, just\r\nwithout the door, trying, by grim looks and angry words, to awe them\r\ninto subjection, I heard a voice behind me, in harshly piercing tones,\r\nexclaiming,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey! Is it possible? What, in the devil\xe2\x80\x99s name, can you be\r\nthinking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get them in, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, turning round, and beholding Mr.\r\nBloomfield, with his hair on end, and his pale blue eyes bolting from\r\ntheir sockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I INSIST upon their being got in!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, approaching nearer,\r\nand looking perfectly ferocious.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, sir, you must call them yourself, if you please, for they won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlisten to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, stepping back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in with you, you filthy brats; or I\xe2\x80\x99ll horsewhip you every one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nroared he; and the children instantly obeyed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, you see!\xe2\x80\x94they\r\ncome at the first word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when _you_ speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s very strange, that when you\xe2\x80\x99ve the care of \xe2\x80\x99em you\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nbetter control over \xe2\x80\x99em than that!\xe2\x80\x94Now, there they are\xe2\x80\x94gone upstairs\r\nwith their nasty snowy feet! Do go after \xe2\x80\x99em and see them made decent,\r\nfor heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s mother was then staying in the house; and, as I\r\nascended the stairs and passed the drawing-room door, I had the\r\nsatisfaction of hearing the old lady declaiming aloud to her\r\ndaughter-in-law to this effect (for I could only distinguish the most\r\nemphatic words)\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious heavens!\xe2\x80\x94never in all my life\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x94get their death as sure as\xe2\x80\x94!\r\nDo you think, my dear, she\xe2\x80\x99s a _proper person_? Take my word for it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heard no more; but that sufficed.\r\n\r\nThe senior Mrs. Bloomfield had been very attentive and civil to me; and\r\ntill now I had thought her a nice, kind-hearted, chatty old body. She\r\nwould often come to me and talk in a confidential strain; nodding and\r\nshaking her head, and gesticulating with hands and eyes, as a certain\r\nclass of old ladies are wont to do; though I never knew one that\r\ncarried the peculiarity to so great an extent. She would even\r\nsympathise with me for the trouble I had with the children, and express\r\nat times, by half sentences, interspersed with nods and knowing winks,\r\nher sense of the injudicious conduct of their mamma in so restricting\r\nmy power, and neglecting to support me with her authority. Such a mode\r\nof testifying disapprobation was not much to my taste; and I generally\r\nrefused to take it in, or understand anything more than was openly\r\nspoken; at least, I never went farther than an implied acknowledgment\r\nthat, if matters were otherwise ordered my task would be a less\r\ndifficult one, and I should be better able to guide and instruct my\r\ncharge; but now I must be doubly cautious. Hitherto, though I saw the\r\nold lady had her defects (of which one was a proneness to proclaim her\r\nperfections), I had always been wishful to excuse them, and to give her\r\ncredit for all the virtues she professed, and even imagine others yet\r\nuntold. Kindness, which had been the food of my life through so many\r\nyears, had lately been so entirely denied me, that I welcomed with\r\ngrateful joy the slightest semblance of it. No wonder, then, that my\r\nheart warmed to the old lady, and always gladdened at her approach and\r\nregretted her departure.\r\n\r\nBut now, the few words luckily or unluckily heard in passing had wholly\r\nrevolutionized my ideas respecting her: now I looked upon her as\r\nhypocritical and insincere, a flatterer, and a spy upon my words and\r\ndeeds. Doubtless it would have been my interest still to meet her with\r\nthe same cheerful smile and tone of respectful cordiality as before;\r\nbut I could not, if I would: my manner altered with my feelings, and\r\nbecame so cold and shy that she could not fail to notice it. She soon\r\ndid notice it, and _her_ manner altered too: the familiar nod was\r\nchanged to a stiff bow, the gracious smile gave place to a glare of\r\nGorgon ferocity; her vivacious loquacity was entirely transferred from\r\nme to \xe2\x80\x9cthe darling boy and girls,\xe2\x80\x9d whom she flattered and indulged more\r\nabsurdly than ever their mother had done.\r\n\r\nI confess I was somewhat troubled at this change: I feared the\r\nconsequences of her displeasure, and even made some efforts to recover\r\nthe ground I had lost\xe2\x80\x94and with better apparent success than I could\r\nhave anticipated. At one time, I, merely in common civility, asked\r\nafter her cough; immediately her long visage relaxed into a smile, and\r\nshe favoured me with a particular history of that and her other\r\ninfirmities, followed by an account of her pious resignation, delivered\r\nin the usual emphatic, declamatory style, which no writing can portray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s one remedy for all, my dear, and that\xe2\x80\x99s resignation\xe2\x80\x9d (a\r\ntoss of the head), \xe2\x80\x9cresignation to the will of heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d (an uplifting\r\nof the hands and eyes). \xe2\x80\x9cIt has always supported me through all my\r\ntrials, and always will do\xe2\x80\x9d (a succession of nods). \xe2\x80\x9cBut then, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neverybody that can say that\xe2\x80\x9d (a shake of the head); \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m one of the\r\npious ones, Miss Grey!\xe2\x80\x9d (a very significant nod and toss). \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, thank\r\nheaven, I always was\xe2\x80\x9d (another nod), \xe2\x80\x9cand I glory in it!\xe2\x80\x9d (an emphatic\r\nclasping of the hands and shaking of the head). And with several texts\r\nof Scripture, misquoted or misapplied, and religious exclamations so\r\nredolent of the ludicrous in the style of delivery and manner of\r\nbringing in, if not in the expressions themselves, that I decline\r\nrepeating them, she withdrew; tossing her large head in high\r\ngood-humour\xe2\x80\x94with herself at least\xe2\x80\x94and left me hoping that, after all,\r\nshe was rather weak than wicked.\r\n\r\nAt her next visit to Wellwood House, I went so far as to say I was glad\r\nto see her looking so well. The effect of this was magical: the words,\r\nintended as a mark of civility, were received as a flattering\r\ncompliment; her countenance brightened up, and from that moment she\r\nbecame as gracious and benign as heart could wish\xe2\x80\x94in outward semblance\r\nat least. From what I now saw of her, and what I heard from the\r\nchildren, I know that, in order to gain her cordial friendship, I had\r\nbut to utter a word of flattery at each convenient opportunity: but\r\nthis was against my principles; and for lack of this, the capricious\r\nold dame soon deprived me of her favour again, and I believe did me\r\nmuch secret injury.\r\n\r\nShe could not greatly influence her daughter-in-law against me,\r\nbecause, between that lady and herself there was a mutual\r\ndislike\xe2\x80\x94chiefly shown by her in secret detractions and calumniations;\r\nby the other, in an excess of frigid formality in her demeanour; and no\r\nfawning flattery of the elder could thaw away the wall of ice which the\r\nyounger interposed between them. But with her son, the old lady had\r\nbetter success: he would listen to all she had to say, provided she\r\ncould soothe his fretful temper, and refrain from irritating him by her\r\nown asperities; and I have reason to believe that she considerably\r\nstrengthened his prejudice against me. She would tell him that I\r\nshamefully neglected the children, and even his wife did not attend to\r\nthem as she ought; and that he must look after them himself, or they\r\nwould all go to ruin.\r\n\r\nThus urged, he would frequently give himself the trouble of watching\r\nthem from the windows during their play; at times, he would follow them\r\nthrough the grounds, and too often came suddenly upon them while they\r\nwere dabbling in the forbidden well, talking to the coachman in the\r\nstables, or revelling in the filth of the farm-yard\xe2\x80\x94and I, meanwhile,\r\nwearily standing by, having previously exhausted my energy in vain\r\nattempts to get them away. Often, too, he would unexpectedly pop his\r\nhead into the schoolroom while the young people were at meals, and find\r\nthem spilling their milk over the table and themselves, plunging their\r\nfingers into their own or each other\xe2\x80\x99s mugs, or quarrelling over their\r\nvictuals like a set of tiger\xe2\x80\x99s cubs. If I were quiet at the moment, I\r\nwas conniving at their disorderly conduct; if (as was frequently the\r\ncase) I happened to be exalting my voice to enforce order, I was using\r\nundue violence, and setting the girls a bad example by such\r\nungentleness of tone and language.\r\n\r\nI remember one afternoon in spring, when, owing to the rain, they could\r\nnot go out; but, by some amazing good fortune, they had all finished\r\ntheir lessons, and yet abstained from running down to tease their\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x94a trick that annoyed me greatly, but which, on rainy days, I\r\nseldom could prevent their doing; because, below, they found novelty\r\nand amusement\xe2\x80\x94especially when visitors were in the house; and their\r\nmother, though she bid me keep them in the schoolroom, would never\r\nchide them for leaving it, or trouble herself to send them back. But\r\nthis day they appeared satisfied with their present abode, and what is\r\nmore wonderful still, seemed disposed to play together without\r\ndepending on me for amusement, and without quarrelling with each other.\r\nTheir occupation was a somewhat puzzling one: they were all squatted\r\ntogether on the floor by the window, over a heap of broken toys and a\r\nquantity of birds\xe2\x80\x99 eggs\xe2\x80\x94or rather egg-shells, for the contents had\r\nluckily been abstracted. These shells they had broken up and were\r\npounding into small fragments, to what end I could not imagine; but so\r\nlong as they were quiet and not in positive mischief, I did not care;\r\nand, with a feeling of unusual repose, I sat by the fire, putting the\r\nfinishing stitches to a frock for Mary Ann\xe2\x80\x99s doll; intending, when that\r\nwas done, to begin a letter to my mother. Suddenly the door opened, and\r\nthe dingy head of Mr. Bloomfield looked in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll very quiet here! What are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo harm _to-day_,\r\nat least,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I. But he was of a different opinion. Advancing to\r\nthe window, and seeing the children\xe2\x80\x99s occupations, he testily\r\nexclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world are you about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re grinding egg-shells, papa!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _dare_ you make such a mess, you little devils? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what\r\nconfounded work you\xe2\x80\x99re making of the carpet?\xe2\x80\x9d (the carpet was a plain\r\nbrown drugget). \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey, did you know what they were doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew it! and you actually sat there and permitted them to go on\r\nwithout a word of reproof!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they were doing any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAny harm! Why, look there! Just look at that carpet, and see\xe2\x80\x94was there\r\never anything like it in a Christian house before? No wonder your room\r\nis not fit for a pigsty\xe2\x80\x94no wonder your pupils are worse than a litter\r\nof pigs!\xe2\x80\x94no wonder\xe2\x80\x94oh! I declare, it puts me quite past my patience\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand he departed, shutting the door after him with a bang that made the\r\nchildren laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt puts me quite past my patience too!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered I, getting up; and,\r\nseizing the poker, I dashed it repeatedly into the cinders, and stirred\r\nthem up with unwonted energy; thus easing my irritation under pretence\r\nof mending the fire.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Mr. Bloomfield was continually looking in to see if the\r\nschoolroom was in order; and, as the children were continually\r\nlittering the floor with fragments of toys, sticks, stones, stubble,\r\nleaves, and other rubbish, which I could not prevent their bringing, or\r\noblige them to gather up, and which the servants refused to \xe2\x80\x9cclean\r\nafter them,\xe2\x80\x9d I had to spend a considerable portion of my valuable\r\nleisure moments on my knees upon the floor, in painsfully reducing\r\nthings to order. Once I told them that they should not taste their\r\nsupper till they had picked up everything from the carpet; Fanny might\r\nhave hers when she had taken up a certain quantity, Mary Ann when she\r\nhad gathered twice as many, and Tom was to clear away the rest.\r\nWonderful to state, the girls did their part; but Tom was in such a\r\nfury that he flew upon the table, scattered the bread and milk about\r\nthe floor, struck his sisters, kicked the coals out of the coal-pan,\r\nattempted to overthrow the table and chairs, and seemed inclined to\r\nmake a Douglas-larder of the whole contents of the room: but I seized\r\nupon him, and, sending Mary Ann to call her mamma, held him, in spite\r\nof kicks, blows, yells, and execrations, till Mrs. Bloomfield made her\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nAnd when the matter was explained to her, all she did was to send for\r\nthe nursery-maid to put the room in order, and bring Master Bloomfield\r\nhis supper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom, triumphantly, looking up from his viands with\r\nhis mouth almost too full for speech. \xe2\x80\x9cThere now, Miss Grey! you see\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve got my supper in spite of you: and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t picked up a single\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe only person in the house who had any real sympathy for me was the\r\nnurse; for she had suffered like afflictions, though in a smaller\r\ndegree; as she had not the task of teaching, nor was she so responsible\r\nfor the conduct of her charge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Grey!\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have some trouble with them\r\nchilder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have, indeed, Betty; and I daresay you know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I do so! But I don\xe2\x80\x99t vex myself o\xe2\x80\x99er \xe2\x80\x99em as you do. And then, you\r\nsee, I hit \xe2\x80\x99em a slap sometimes: and them little \xe2\x80\x99uns\xe2\x80\x94I gives \xe2\x80\x99em a\r\ngood whipping now and then: there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else will do for \xe2\x80\x99em, as\r\nwhat they say. Howsoever, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my place for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you, Betty? I heard you were going to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, bless you, yes! Missis gave me warning a three wik sin\xe2\x80\x9d. She told\r\nme afore Christmas how it mud be, if I hit \xe2\x80\x99em again; but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhold my hand off \xe2\x80\x99em at nothing. I know not how _you_ do, for Miss Mary\r\nAnn\xe2\x80\x99s worse by the half nor her sisters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHE UNCLE\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the old lady, there was another relative of the family, whose\r\nvisits were a great annoyance to me\xe2\x80\x94this was \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Robson,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nBloomfield\xe2\x80\x99s brother; a tall, self-sufficient fellow, with dark hair\r\nand sallow complexion like his sister, a nose that seemed to disdain\r\nthe earth, and little grey eyes, frequently half-closed, with a mixture\r\nof real stupidity and affected contempt of all surrounding objects. He\r\nwas a thick-set, strongly-built man, but he had found some means of\r\ncompressing his waist into a remarkably small compass; and that,\r\ntogether with the unnatural stillness of his form, showed that the\r\nlofty-minded, manly Mr. Robson, the scorner of the female sex, was not\r\nabove the foppery of stays. He seldom deigned to notice me; and, when\r\nhe did, it was with a certain supercilious insolence of tone and manner\r\nthat convinced me he was no gentleman: though it was intended to have a\r\ncontrary effect. But it was not for that I disliked his coming, so much\r\nas for the harm he did the children\xe2\x80\x94encouraging all their evil\r\npropensities, and undoing in a few minutes the little good it had taken\r\nme months of labour to achieve.\r\n\r\nFanny and little Harriet he seldom condescended to notice; but Mary Ann\r\nwas something of a favourite. He was continually encouraging her\r\ntendency to affectation (which I had done my utmost to crush), talking\r\nabout her pretty face, and filling her head with all manner of\r\nconceited notions concerning her personal appearance (which I had\r\ninstructed her to regard as dust in the balance compared with the\r\ncultivation of her mind and manners); and I never saw a child so\r\nsusceptible of flattery as she was. Whatever was wrong, in either her\r\nor her brother, he would encourage by laughing at, if not by actually\r\npraising: people little know the injury they do to children by laughing\r\nat their faults, and making a pleasant jest of what their true friends\r\nhave endeavoured to teach them to hold in grave abhorrence.\r\n\r\nThough not a positive drunkard, Mr. Robson habitually swallowed great\r\nquantities of wine, and took with relish an occasional glass of brandy\r\nand water. He taught his nephew to imitate him in this to the utmost of\r\nhis ability, and to believe that the more wine and spirits he could\r\ntake, and the better he liked them, the more he manifested his bold,\r\nand manly spirit, and rose superior to his sisters. Mr. Bloomfield had\r\nnot much to say against it, for his favourite beverage was gin and\r\nwater; of which he took a considerable portion every day, by dint of\r\nconstant sipping\xe2\x80\x94and to that I chiefly attributed his dingy complexion\r\nand waspish temper.\r\n\r\nMr. Robson likewise encouraged Tom\xe2\x80\x99s propensity to persecute the lower\r\ncreation, both by precept and example. As he frequently came to course\r\nor shoot over his brother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s grounds, he would bring his\r\nfavourite dogs with him; and he treated them so brutally that, poor as\r\nI was, I would have given a sovereign any day to see one of them bite\r\nhim, provided the animal could have done it with impunity. Sometimes,\r\nwhen in a very complacent mood, he would go a-birds\xe2\x80\x99-nesting with the\r\nchildren, a thing that irritated and annoyed me exceedingly; as, by\r\nfrequent and persevering attempts, I flattered myself I had partly\r\nshown them the evil of this pastime, and hoped, in time, to bring them\r\nto some general sense of justice and humanity; but ten minutes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbirds\xe2\x80\x99-nesting with uncle Robson, or even a laugh from him at some\r\nrelation of their former barbarities, was sufficient at once to destroy\r\nthe effect of my whole elaborate course of reasoning and persuasion.\r\nHappily, however, during that spring, they never, but once, got\r\nanything but empty nests, or eggs\xe2\x80\x94being too impatient to leave them\r\ntill the birds were hatched; that once, Tom, who had been with his\r\nuncle into the neighbouring plantation, came running in high glee into\r\nthe garden, with a brood of little callow nestlings in his hands. Mary\r\nAnn and Fanny, whom I was just bringing out, ran to admire his spoils,\r\nand to beg each a bird for themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not one!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Tom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all mine; uncle Robson gave them to me\xe2\x80\x94one, two, three, four,\r\nfive\xe2\x80\x94you shan\xe2\x80\x99t touch one of them! no, not one, for your lives!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued he, exultingly; laying the nest on the ground, and standing\r\nover it with his legs wide apart, his hands thrust into his\r\nbreeches-pockets, his body bent forward, and his face twisted into all\r\nmanner of contortions in the ecstasy of his delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you shall see me fettle \xe2\x80\x99em off. My word, but I _will_ wallop \xe2\x80\x99em?\r\nSee if I don\xe2\x80\x99t now. By gum! but there\xe2\x80\x99s rare sport for me in that\r\nnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Tom,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not allow you to torture those birds. They\r\nmust either be killed at once or carried back to the place you took\r\nthem from, that the old birds may continue to feed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where that is, Madam: it\xe2\x80\x99s only me and uncle Robson\r\nthat knows that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me, I shall kill them myself\xe2\x80\x94much as I hate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou daren\xe2\x80\x99t. You daren\xe2\x80\x99t touch them for your life! because you know\r\npapa and mamma, and uncle Robson, would be angry. Ha, ha! I\xe2\x80\x99ve caught\r\nyou there, Miss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do what I think right in a case of this sort without\r\nconsulting any one. If your papa and mamma don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to approve of\r\nit, I shall be sorry to offend them; but your uncle Robson\xe2\x80\x99s opinions,\r\nof course, are nothing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying\xe2\x80\x94urged by a sense of duty\xe2\x80\x94at the risk of both making myself\r\nsick and incurring the wrath of my employers\xe2\x80\x94I got a large flat stone,\r\nthat had been reared up for a mouse-trap by the gardener; then, having\r\nonce more vainly endeavoured to persuade the little tyrant to let the\r\nbirds be carried back, I asked what he intended to do with them. With\r\nfiendish glee he commenced a list of torments; and while he was busied\r\nin the relation, I dropped the stone upon his intended victims and\r\ncrushed them flat beneath it. Loud were the outcries, terrible the\r\nexecrations, consequent upon this daring outrage; uncle Robson had been\r\ncoming up the walk with his gun, and was just then pausing to kick his\r\ndog. Tom flew towards him, vowing he would make him kick me instead of\r\nJuno. Mr. Robson leant upon his gun, and laughed excessively at the\r\nviolence of his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s passion, and the bitter maledictions and\r\nopprobrious epithets he heaped upon me. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _are_ a good \xe2\x80\x99un!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nexclaimed he, at length, taking up his weapon and proceeding towards\r\nthe house. \xe2\x80\x9cDamme, but the lad has some spunk in him, too. Curse me, if\r\never I saw a nobler little scoundrel than that. He\xe2\x80\x99s beyond petticoat\r\ngovernment already: by God! he defies mother, granny, governess, and\r\nall! Ha, ha, ha! Never mind, Tom, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you another brood\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do, Mr. Robson, I shall kill them too,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, and having honoured me with a broad stare\xe2\x80\x94which,\r\ncontrary to his expectations, I sustained without flinching\xe2\x80\x94he turned\r\naway with an air of supreme contempt, and stalked into the house. Tom\r\nnext went to tell his mamma. It was not her way to say much on any\r\nsubject; but, when she next saw me, her aspect and demeanour were\r\ndoubly dark and chilled. After some casual remark about the weather,\r\nshe observed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, Miss Grey, you should think it necessary to\r\ninterfere with Master Bloomfield\xe2\x80\x99s amusements; he was very much\r\ndistressed about your destroying the birds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Master Bloomfield\xe2\x80\x99s amusements consist in injuring sentient\r\ncreatures,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it my duty to interfere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seemed to have forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the creatures\r\nwere all created for our convenience.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought that doctrine admitted some doubt, but merely replied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIf\r\nthey were, we have no right to torment them for our amusement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9ca child\xe2\x80\x99s amusement is scarcely to be weighed\r\nagainst the welfare of a soulless brute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, for the child\xe2\x80\x99s own sake, it ought not to be encouraged to have\r\nsuch amusements,\xe2\x80\x9d answered I, as meekly as I could, to make up for such\r\nunusual pertinacity. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain\r\nmercy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! of course; but that refers to our conduct towards each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The merciful man shows mercy to his beast,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to add.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think _you_ have not shown much mercy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, with a short,\r\nbitter laugh; \xe2\x80\x9ckilling the poor birds by wholesale in that shocking\r\nmanner, and putting the dear boy to such misery for a mere whim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI judged it prudent to say no more. This was the nearest approach to a\r\nquarrel I ever had with Mrs. Bloomfield; as well as the greatest number\r\nof words I ever exchanged with her at one time, since the day of my\r\nfirst arrival.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Robson and old Mrs. Bloomfield were not the only guests whose\r\ncoming to Wellwood House annoyed me; every visitor disturbed me more or\r\nless; not so much because they neglected me (though I did feel their\r\nconduct strange and disagreeable in that respect), as because I found\r\nit impossible to keep my pupils away from them, as I was repeatedly\r\ndesired to do: Tom must talk to them, and Mary Ann must be noticed by\r\nthem. Neither the one nor the other knew what it was to feel any degree\r\nof shamefacedness, or even common modesty. They would indecently and\r\nclamorously interrupt the conversation of their elders, tease them with\r\nthe most impertinent questions, roughly collar the gentlemen, climb\r\ntheir knees uninvited, hang about their shoulders or rifle their\r\npockets, pull the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 gowns, disorder their hair, tumble their\r\ncollars, and importunately beg for their trinkets.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bloomfield had the sense to be shocked and annoyed at all this,\r\nbut she had not sense to prevent it: she expected me to prevent it. But\r\nhow could I\xe2\x80\x94when the guests, with their fine clothes and new faces,\r\ncontinually flattered and indulged them, out of complaisance to their\r\nparents\xe2\x80\x94how could I, with my homely garments, every-day face, and\r\nhonest words, draw them away? I strained every nerve to do so: by\r\nstriving to amuse them, I endeavoured to attract them to my side; by\r\nthe exertion of such authority as I possessed, and by such severity as\r\nI dared to use, I tried to deter them from tormenting the guests; and\r\nby reproaching their unmannerly conduct, to make them ashamed to repeat\r\nit. But they knew no shame; they scorned authority which had no terrors\r\nto back it; and as for kindness and affection, either they had no\r\nhearts, or such as they had were so strongly guarded, and so well\r\nconcealed, that I, with all my efforts, had not yet discovered how to\r\nreach them.\r\n\r\nBut soon my trials in this quarter came to a close\xe2\x80\x94sooner than I either\r\nexpected or desired; for one sweet evening towards the close of May, as\r\nI was rejoicing in the near approach of the holidays, and\r\ncongratulating myself upon having made some progress with my pupils (as\r\nfar as their learning went, at least, for I _had_ instilled _something_\r\ninto their heads, and I had, at length, brought them to be a little\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nvery little\xe2\x80\x94more rational about getting their lessons done in time to\r\nleave some space for recreation, instead of tormenting themselves and\r\nme all day long to no purpose), Mrs. Bloomfield sent for me, and calmly\r\ntold me that after Midsummer my services would be no longer required.\r\nShe assured me that my character and general conduct were\r\nunexceptionable; but the children had made so little improvement since\r\nmy arrival that Mr. Bloomfield and she felt it their duty to seek some\r\nother mode of instruction. Though superior to most children of their\r\nyears in abilities, they were decidedly behind them in attainments;\r\ntheir manners were uncultivated, and their tempers unruly. And this she\r\nattributed to a want of sufficient firmness, and diligent, persevering\r\ncare on my part.\r\n\r\nUnshaken firmness, devoted diligence, unwearied perseverance, unceasing\r\ncare, were the very qualifications on which I had secretly prided\r\nmyself; and by which I had hoped in time to overcome all difficulties,\r\nand obtain success at last. I wished to say something in my own\r\njustification; but in attempting to speak, I felt my voice falter; and\r\nrather than testify any emotion, or suffer the tears to overflow that\r\nwere already gathering in my eyes, I chose to keep silence, and bear\r\nall like a self-convicted culprit.\r\n\r\nThus was I dismissed, and thus I sought my home. Alas! what would they\r\nthink of me? unable, after all my boasting, to keep my place, even for\r\na single year, as governess to three small children, whose mother was\r\nasserted by my own aunt to be a \xe2\x80\x9cvery nice woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Having been thus\r\nweighed in the balance and found wanting, I need not hope they would be\r\nwilling to try me again. And this was an unwelcome thought; for vexed,\r\nharassed, disappointed as I had been, and greatly as I had learned to\r\nlove and value my home, I was not yet weary of adventure, nor willing\r\nto relax my efforts. I knew that all parents were not like Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBloomfield, and I was certain all children were not like theirs. The\r\nnext family must be different, and any change must be for the better. I\r\nhad been seasoned by adversity, and tutored by experience, and I longed\r\nto redeem my lost honour in the eyes of those whose opinion was more\r\nthan that of all the world to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE PARSONAGE AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few months I remained peaceably at home, in the quiet enjoyment\r\nof liberty and rest, and genuine friendship, from all of which I had\r\nfasted so long; and in the earnest prosecution of my studies, to\r\nrecover what I had lost during my stay at Wellwood House, and to lay in\r\nnew stores for future use. My father\xe2\x80\x99s health was still very infirm,\r\nbut not materially worse than when I last saw him; and I was glad I had\r\nit in my power to cheer him by my return, and to amuse him with singing\r\nhis favourite songs.\r\n\r\nNo one triumphed over my failure, or said I had better have taken his\r\nor her advice, and quietly stayed at home. All were glad to have me\r\nback again, and lavished more kindness than ever upon me, to make up\r\nfor the sufferings I had undergone; but not one would touch a shilling\r\nof what I had so cheerfully earned and so carefully saved, in the hope\r\nof sharing it with them. By dint of pinching here, and scraping there,\r\nour debts were already nearly paid. Mary had had good success with her\r\ndrawings; but our father had insisted upon _her_ likewise keeping all\r\nthe produce of her industry to herself. All we could spare from the\r\nsupply of our humble wardrobe and our little casual expenses, he\r\ndirected us to put into the savings\xe2\x80\x99-bank; saying, we knew not how soon\r\nwe might be dependent on that alone for support: for he felt he had not\r\nlong to be with us, and what would become of our mother and us when he\r\nwas gone, God only knew!\r\n\r\nDear papa! if he had troubled himself less about the afflictions that\r\nthreatened us in case of his death, I am convinced that dreaded event\r\nwould not have taken place so soon. My mother would never suffer him to\r\nponder on the subject if she could help it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Richard!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she, on one occasion, \xe2\x80\x9cif you would but\r\ndismiss such gloomy subjects from your mind, you would live as long as\r\nany of us; at least you would live to see the girls married, and\r\nyourself a happy grandfather, with a canty old dame for your\r\ncompanion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mother laughed, and so did my father: but his laugh soon perished in\r\na dreary sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_They_ married\xe2\x80\x94poor penniless things!\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cwho will take them I\r\nwonder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, nobody shall that isn\xe2\x80\x99t thankful for them. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I penniless\r\nwhen you took me? and you _pretended_, at least, to be vastly pleased\r\nwith your acquisition. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter whether they get married or\r\nnot: we can devise a thousand honest ways of making a livelihood. And I\r\nwonder, Richard, you can think of bothering your head about our\r\n_poverty_ in case of your death; as if _that_ would be anything\r\ncompared with the calamity of losing you\xe2\x80\x94an affliction that you well\r\nknow would swallow up all others, and which you ought to do your utmost\r\nto preserve us from: and there is nothing like a cheerful mind for\r\nkeeping the body in health.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Alice, it is wrong to keep repining as I do, but I cannot help\r\nit: you must bear with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ bear with you, if I can alter you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied my mother: but\r\nthe harshness of her words was undone by the earnest affection of her\r\ntone and pleasant smile, that made my father smile again, less sadly\r\nand less transiently than was his wont.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as soon as I could find an opportunity of speaking\r\nwith her alone, \xe2\x80\x9cmy money is but little, and cannot last long; if I\r\ncould increase it, it would lessen papa\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety, on one subject at\r\nleast. I cannot draw like Mary, and so the best thing I could do would\r\nbe to look out for another situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you would actually try again, Agnes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, I would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, my dear, I should have thought you had had enough of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody is not like Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome are worse,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not many, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m sure all children are not\r\nlike theirs; for I and Mary were not: we always did as you bid us,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally: but then, I did not spoil you; and you were not perfect\r\nangels after all: Mary had a fund of quiet obstinacy, and you were\r\nsomewhat faulty in regard to temper; but you were very good children on\r\nthe whole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I was sulky sometimes, and I should have been glad to see these\r\nchildren sulky sometimes too; for then I could have understood them:\r\nbut they never were, for they _could_ not be offended, nor hurt, nor\r\nashamed: they could not be unhappy in any way, except when they were in\r\na passion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if they _could_ not, it was not their fault: you cannot expect\r\nstone to be as pliable as clay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but still it is very unpleasant to live with such unimpressible,\r\nincomprehensible creatures. You cannot love them; and if you could,\r\nyour love would be utterly thrown away: they could neither return it,\r\nnor value, nor understand it. But, however, even if I should stumble on\r\nsuch a family again, which is quite unlikely, I have all this\r\nexperience to begin with, and I should manage better another time; and\r\nthe end and aim of this preamble is, let me try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my girl, you are not easily discouraged, I see: I am glad of\r\nthat. But, let me tell you, you are a good deal paler and thinner than\r\nwhen you first left home; and we cannot have you undermining your\r\nhealth to hoard up money either for yourself or others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary tells me I am changed too; and I don\xe2\x80\x99t much wonder at it, for I\r\nwas in a constant state of agitation and anxiety all day long: but next\r\ntime I am determined to take things coolly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some further discussion, my mother promised once more to assist\r\nme, provided I would wait and be patient; and I left her to broach the\r\nmatter to my father, when and how she deemed it most advisable: never\r\ndoubting her ability to obtain his consent. Meantime, I searched, with\r\ngreat interest, the advertising columns of the newspapers, and wrote\r\nanswers to every \xe2\x80\x9cWanted a Governess\xe2\x80\x9d that appeared at all eligible;\r\nbut all my letters, as well as the replies, when I got any, were\r\ndutifully shown to my mother; and she, to my chagrin, made me reject\r\nthe situations one after another: these were low people, these were too\r\nexacting in their demands, and these too niggardly in their\r\nremuneration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour talents are not such as every poor clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\npossesses, Agnes,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, \xe2\x80\x9cand you must not throw them away.\r\nRemember, you promised to be patient: there is no need of hurry: you\r\nhave plenty of time before you, and may have many chances yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt length, she advised me to put an advertisement, myself, in the\r\npaper, stating my qualifications, &c.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMusic, singing, drawing, French, Latin, and German,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9care no\r\nmean assemblage: many will be glad to have so much in one instructor;\r\nand this time, you shall try your fortune in a somewhat higher\r\nfamily\xe2\x80\x94in that of some genuine, thoroughbred gentleman; for such are\r\nfar more likely to treat you with proper respect and consideration than\r\nthose purse-proud tradespeople and arrogant upstarts. I have known\r\nseveral among the higher ranks who treated their governesses quite as\r\none of the family; though some, I allow, are as insolent and exacting\r\nas any one else can be: for there are bad and good in all classes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe advertisement was quickly written and despatched. Of the two\r\nparties who answered it, but one would consent to give me fifty pounds,\r\nthe sum my mother bade me name as the salary I should require; and\r\nhere, I hesitated about engaging myself, as I feared the children would\r\nbe too old, and their parents would require some one more showy, or\r\nmore experienced, if not more accomplished than I. But my mother\r\ndissuaded me from declining it on that account: I should do vastly\r\nwell, she said, if I would only throw aside my diffidence, and acquire\r\na little more confidence in myself. I was just to give a plain, true\r\nstatement of my acquirements and qualifications, and name what\r\nstipulations I chose to make, and then await the result. The only\r\nstipulation I ventured to propose, was that I might be allowed two\r\nmonths\xe2\x80\x99 holidays during the year to visit my friends, at Midsummer and\r\nChristmas. The unknown lady, in her reply, made no objection to this,\r\nand stated that, as to my acquirements, she had no doubt I should be\r\nable to give satisfaction; but in the engagement of governesses she\r\nconsidered those things as but subordinate points; as being situated in\r\nthe neighbourhood of O\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, she could get masters to supply any\r\ndeficiencies in that respect: but, in her opinion, next to\r\nunimpeachable morality, a mild and cheerful temper and obliging\r\ndisposition were the most essential requisities.\r\n\r\nMy mother did not relish this at all, and now made many objections to\r\nmy accepting the situation; in which my sister warmly supported her:\r\nbut, unwilling to be balked again, I overruled them all; and, having\r\nfirst obtained the consent of my father (who had, a short time\r\npreviously, been apprised of these transactions), I wrote a most\r\nobliging epistle to my unknown correspondent, and, finally, the bargain\r\nwas concluded.\r\n\r\nIt was decreed that on the last day of January I was to enter upon my\r\nnew office as governess in the family of Mr. Murray, of Horton Lodge,\r\nnear O\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, about seventy miles from our village: a formidable distance\r\nto me, as I had never been above twenty miles from home in all the\r\ncourse of my twenty years\xe2\x80\x99 sojourn on earth; and as, moreover, every\r\nindividual in that family and in the neighbourhood was utterly unknown\r\nto myself and all my acquaintances. But this rendered it only the more\r\npiquant to me. I had now, in some measure, got rid of the _mauvaise\r\nhonte_ that had formerly oppressed me so much; there was a pleasing\r\nexcitement in the idea of entering these unknown regions, and making my\r\nway alone among its strange inhabitants. I now flattered myself I was\r\ngoing to see something in the world: Mr. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s residence was near a\r\nlarge town, and not in a manufacturing district, where the people had\r\nnothing to do but to make money; his rank from what I could gather,\r\nappeared to be higher than that of Mr. Bloomfield; and, doubtless, he\r\nwas one of those genuine thoroughbred gentry my mother spoke of, who\r\nwould treat his governess with due consideration as a respectable\r\nwell-educated lady, the instructor and guide of his children, and not a\r\nmere upper servant. Then, my pupils being older, would be more\r\nrational, more teachable, and less troublesome than the last; they\r\nwould be less confined to the schoolroom, and not require that constant\r\nlabour and incessant watching; and, finally, bright visions mingled\r\nwith my hopes, with which the care of children and the mere duties of a\r\ngoverness had little or nothing to do. Thus, the reader will see that I\r\nhad no claim to be regarded as a martyr to filial piety, going forth to\r\nsacrifice peace and liberty for the sole purpose of laying up stores\r\nfor the comfort and support of my parents: though certainly the comfort\r\nof my father, and the future support of my mother, had a large share in\r\nmy calculations; and fifty pounds appeared to me no ordinary sum. I\r\nmust have decent clothes becoming my station; I must, it seemed, put\r\nout my washing, and also pay for my four annual journeys between Horton\r\nLodge and home; but with strict attention to economy, surely twenty\r\npounds, or little more, would cover those expenses, and then there\r\nwould be thirty for the bank, or little less: what a valuable addition\r\nto our stock! Oh, I must struggle to keep this situation, whatever it\r\nmight be! both for my own honour among my friends and for the solid\r\nservices I might render them by my continuance there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nHORTON LODGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 31st of January was a wild, tempestuous day: there was a strong\r\nnorth wind, with a continual storm of snow drifting on the ground and\r\nwhirling through the air. My friends would have had me delay my\r\ndeparture, but fearful of prejudicing my employers against me by such\r\nwant of punctuality at the commencement of my undertaking, I persisted\r\nin keeping the appointment.\r\n\r\nI will not inflict upon my readers an account of my leaving home on\r\nthat dark winter morning: the fond farewells, the long, long journey to\r\nO\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, the solitary waitings in inns for coaches or trains\xe2\x80\x94for there were\r\nsome railways then\xe2\x80\x94and, finally, the meeting at O\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 with Mr. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservant, who had been sent with the phaeton to drive me from thence to\r\nHorton Lodge. I will just state that the heavy snow had thrown such\r\nimpediments in the way of both horses and steam-engines, that it was\r\ndark some hours before I reached my journey\xe2\x80\x99s end, and that a most\r\nbewildering storm came on at last, which made the few miles\xe2\x80\x99 space\r\nbetween O\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and Horton Lodge a long and formidable passage. I sat\r\nresigned, with the cold, sharp snow drifting through my veil and\r\nfilling my lap, seeing nothing, and wondering how the unfortunate horse\r\nand driver could make their way even as well as they did; and indeed it\r\nwas but a toilsome, creeping style of progression, to say the best of\r\nit. At length we paused; and, at the call of the driver, someone\r\nunlatched and rolled back upon their creaking hinges what appeared to\r\nbe the park gates. Then we proceeded along a smoother road, whence,\r\noccasionally, I perceived some huge, hoary mass gleaming through the\r\ndarkness, which I took to be a portion of a snow-clad tree. After a\r\nconsiderable time we paused again, before the stately portico of a\r\nlarge house with long windows descending to the ground.\r\n\r\nI rose with some difficulty from under the superincumbent snowdrift,\r\nand alighted from the carriage, expecting that a kind and hospitable\r\nreception would indemnify me for the toils and hardships of the day. A\r\ngentlemanly person in black opened the door, and admitted me into a\r\nspacious hall, lighted by an amber-coloured lamp suspended from the\r\nceiling; he led me through this, along a passage, and opening the door\r\nof a back room, told me that was the schoolroom. I entered, and found\r\ntwo young ladies and two young gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94my future pupils, I supposed.\r\nAfter a formal greeting, the elder girl, who was trifling over a piece\r\nof canvas and a basket of German wools, asked if I should like to go\r\nupstairs. I replied in the affirmative, of course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatilda, take a candle, and show her her room,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\nMiss Matilda, a strapping hoyden of about fourteen, with a short frock\r\nand trousers, shrugged her shoulders and made a slight grimace, but\r\ntook a candle and proceeded before me up the back stairs (a long,\r\nsteep, double flight), and through a long, narrow passage, to a small\r\nbut tolerably comfortable room. She then asked me if I would take some\r\ntea or coffee. I was about to answer No; but remembering that I had\r\ntaken nothing since seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock that morning, and feeling faint in\r\nconsequence, I said I would take a cup of tea. Saying she would tell\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrown,\xe2\x80\x9d the young lady departed; and by the time I had divested myself\r\nof my heavy, wet cloak, shawl, bonnet, &c., a mincing damsel came to\r\nsay the young ladies desired to know whether I would take my tea up\r\nthere or in the schoolroom. Under the plea of fatigue I chose to take\r\nit there. She withdrew; and, after a while, returned again with a small\r\ntea-tray, and placed it on the chest of drawers, which served as a\r\ndressing-table. Having civilly thanked her, I asked at what time I\r\nshould be expected to rise in the morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young ladies and gentlemen breakfast at half-past eight, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she; \xe2\x80\x9cthey rise early; but, as they seldom do any lessons before\r\nbreakfast, I should think it will do if you rise soon after seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI desired her to be so kind as to call me at seven, and, promising to\r\ndo so, she withdrew. Then, having broken my long fast on a cup of tea\r\nand a little thin bread and butter, I sat down beside the small,\r\nsmouldering fire, and amused myself with a hearty fit of crying; after\r\nwhich, I said my prayers, and then, feeling considerably relieved,\r\nbegan to prepare for bed. Finding that none of my luggage was brought\r\nup, I instituted a search for the bell; and failing to discover any\r\nsigns of such a convenience in any corner of the room, I took my candle\r\nand ventured through the long passage, and down the steep stairs, on a\r\nvoyage of discovery. Meeting a well-dressed female on the way, I told\r\nher what I wanted; but not without considerable hesitation, as I was\r\nnot quite sure whether it was one of the upper servants, or Mrs. Murray\r\nherself: it happened, however, to be the lady\xe2\x80\x99s-maid. With the air of\r\none conferring an unusual favour, she vouchsafed to undertake the\r\nsending up of my things; and when I had re-entered my room, and waited\r\nand wondered a long time (greatly fearing that she had forgotten or\r\nneglected to perform her promise, and doubting whether to keep waiting\r\nor go to bed, or go down again), my hopes, at length, were revived by\r\nthe sound of voices and laughter, accompanied by the tramp of feet\r\nalong the passage; and presently the luggage was brought in by a\r\nrough-looking maid and a man, neither of them very respectful in their\r\ndemeanour to me. Having shut the door upon their retiring footsteps,\r\nand unpacked a few of my things, I betook myself to rest; gladly\r\nenough, for I was weary in body and mind.\r\n\r\nIt was with a strange feeling of desolation, mingled with a strong\r\nsense of the novelty of my situation, and a joyless kind of curiosity\r\nconcerning what was yet unknown, that I awoke the next morning; feeling\r\nlike one whirled away by enchantment, and suddenly dropped from the\r\nclouds into a remote and unknown land, widely and completely isolated\r\nfrom all he had ever seen or known before; or like a thistle-seed borne\r\non the wind to some strange nook of uncongenial soil, where it must lie\r\nlong enough before it can take root and germinate, extracting\r\nnourishment from what appears so alien to its nature: if, indeed, it\r\never can. But this gives no proper idea of my feelings at all; and no\r\none that has not lived such a retired, stationary life as mine, can\r\npossibly imagine what they were: hardly even if he has known what it is\r\nto awake some morning, and find himself in Port Nelson, in New Zealand,\r\nwith a world of waters between himself and all that knew him.\r\n\r\nI shall not soon forget the peculiar feeling with which I raised my\r\nblind and looked out upon the unknown world: a wide, white wilderness\r\nwas all that met my gaze; a waste of\r\n\r\nDeserts tossed in snow,\r\nAnd heavy laden groves.\r\n\r\n\r\nI descended to the schoolroom with no remarkable eagerness to join my\r\npupils, though not without some feeling of curiosity respecting what a\r\nfurther acquaintance would reveal. One thing, among others of more\r\nobvious importance, I determined with myself\xe2\x80\x94I must begin with calling\r\nthem Miss and Master. It seemed to me a chilling and unnatural piece of\r\npunctilio between the children of a family and their instructor and\r\ndaily companion; especially where the former were in their early\r\nchildhood, as at Wellwood House; but even there, my calling the little\r\nBloomfields by their simple names had been regarded as an offensive\r\nliberty: as their parents had taken care to show me, by carefully\r\ndesignating them _Master_ and _Miss_ Bloomfield, &c., in speaking to\r\nme. I had been very slow to take the hint, because the whole affair\r\nstruck me as so very absurd; but now I determined to be wiser, and\r\nbegin at once with as much form and ceremony as any member of the\r\nfamily would be likely to require: and, indeed, the children being so\r\nmuch older, there would be less difficulty; though the little words\r\nMiss and Master seemed to have a surprising effect in repressing all\r\nfamiliar, open-hearted kindness, and extinguishing every gleam of\r\ncordiality that might arise between us.\r\n\r\nAs I cannot, like Dogberry, find it in my heart to bestow all my\r\ntediousness upon the reader, I will not go on to bore him with a minute\r\ndetail of all the discoveries and proceedings of this and the following\r\nday. No doubt he will be amply satisfied with a slight sketch of the\r\ndifferent members of the family, and a general view of the first year\r\nor two of my sojourn among them.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the head: Mr. Murray was, by all accounts, a blustering,\r\nroystering, country squire: a devoted fox-hunter, a skilful\r\nhorse-jockey and farrier, an active, practical farmer, and a hearty\r\n_bon vivant_. By all accounts, I say; for, except on Sundays, when he\r\nwent to church, I never saw him from month to month: unless, in\r\ncrossing the hall or walking in the grounds, the figure of a tall,\r\nstout gentleman, with scarlet cheeks and crimson nose, happened to come\r\nacross me; on which occasions, if he passed near enough to speak, an\r\nunceremonious nod, accompanied by a \xe2\x80\x9cMorning, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d or some such\r\nbrief salutation, was usually vouchsafed. Frequently, indeed, his loud\r\nlaugh reached me from afar; and oftener still I heard him swearing and\r\nblaspheming against the footmen, groom, coachman, or some other hapless\r\ndependant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Murray was a handsome, dashing lady of forty, who certainly\r\nrequired neither rouge nor padding to add to her charms; and whose\r\nchief enjoyments were, or seemed to be, in giving or frequenting\r\nparties, and in dressing at the very top of the fashion. I did not see\r\nher till eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the morning after my arrival; when she\r\nhonoured me with a visit, just as my mother might step into the kitchen\r\nto see a new servant-girl: yet not so, either, for my mother would have\r\nseen her immediately after her arrival, and not waited till the next\r\nday; and, moreover, she would have addressed her in a more kind and\r\nfriendly manner, and given her some words of comfort as well as a plain\r\nexposition of her duties; but Mrs. Murray did neither the one nor the\r\nother. She just stepped into the schoolroom on her return from ordering\r\ndinner in the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s room, bade me good-morning, stood for two\r\nminutes by the fire, said a few words about the weather and the \xe2\x80\x9crather\r\nrough\xe2\x80\x9d journey I must have had yesterday; petted her youngest child\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nboy of ten\xe2\x80\x94who had just been wiping his mouth and hands on her gown,\r\nafter indulging in some savoury morsel from the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s store;\r\ntold me what a sweet, good boy he was; and then sailed out, with a\r\nself-complacent smile upon her face: thinking, no doubt, that she had\r\ndone quite enough for the present, and had been delightfully\r\ncondescending into the bargain. Her children evidently held the same\r\nopinion, and I alone thought otherwise.\r\n\r\nAfter this she looked in upon me once or twice, during the absence of\r\nmy pupils, to enlighten me concerning my duties towards them. For the\r\ngirls she seemed anxious only to render them as superficially\r\nattractive and showily accomplished as they could possibly be made,\r\nwithout present trouble or discomfort to themselves; and I was to act\r\naccordingly\xe2\x80\x94to study and strive to amuse and oblige, instruct, refine,\r\nand polish, with the least possible exertion on their part, and no\r\nexercise of authority on mine. With regard to the two boys, it was much\r\nthe same; only instead of accomplishments, I was to get the greatest\r\npossible quantity of Latin grammar and Valpy\xe2\x80\x99s Delectus into their\r\nheads, in order to fit them for school\xe2\x80\x94the greatest possible quantity\r\nat least _without_ trouble to themselves. John might be a \xe2\x80\x9clittle\r\nhigh-spirited,\xe2\x80\x9d and Charles might be a little \xe2\x80\x9cnervous and tedious\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut at all events, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope _you_ will keep your\r\ntemper, and be mild and patient throughout; especially with the dear\r\nlittle Charles; he is so extremely nervous and susceptible, and so\r\nutterly unaccustomed to anything but the tenderest treatment. You will\r\nexcuse my naming these things to you; for the fact is, I have hitherto\r\nfound all the governesses, even the very best of them, faulty in this\r\nparticular. They wanted that meek and quiet spirit, which St. Matthew,\r\nor some of them, says is better than the putting on of apparel\xe2\x80\x94you will\r\nknow the passage to which I allude, for you are a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\nBut I have no doubt you will give satisfaction in this respect as well\r\nas the rest. And remember, on all occasions, when any of the young\r\npeople do anything improper, if persuasion and gentle remonstrance will\r\nnot do, let one of the others come and tell me; for I can speak to them\r\nmore plainly than it would be proper for you to do. And make them as\r\nhappy as you can, Miss Grey, and I dare say you will do very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI observed that while Mrs. Murray was so extremely solicitous for the\r\ncomfort and happiness of her children, and continually talking about\r\nit, she never once mentioned mine; though they were at home, surrounded\r\nby friends, and I an alien among strangers; and I did not yet know\r\nenough of the world, not to be considerably surprised at this anomaly.\r\n\r\nMiss Murray, otherwise Rosalie, was about sixteen when I came, and\r\ndecidedly a very pretty girl; and in two years longer, as time more\r\ncompletely developed her form and added grace to her carriage and\r\ndeportment, she became positively beautiful; and that in no common\r\ndegree. She was tall and slender, yet not thin; perfectly formed,\r\nexquisitely fair, though not without a brilliant, healthy bloom; her\r\nhair, which she wore in a profusion of long ringlets, was of a very\r\nlight brown inclining to yellow; her eyes were pale blue, but so clear\r\nand bright that few would wish them darker; the rest of her features\r\nwere small, not quite regular, and not remarkably otherwise: but\r\naltogether you could not hesitate to pronounce her a very lovely girl.\r\nI wish I could say as much for mind and disposition as I can for her\r\nform and face.\r\n\r\nYet think not I have any dreadful disclosures to make: she was lively,\r\nlight-hearted, and could be very agreeable, with those who did not\r\ncross her will. Towards me, when I first came, she was cold and\r\nhaughty, then insolent and overbearing; but, on a further acquaintance,\r\nshe gradually laid aside her airs, and in time became as deeply\r\nattached to me as it was possible for _her_ to be to one of my\r\ncharacter and position: for she seldom lost sight, for above half an\r\nhour at a time, of the fact of my being a hireling and a poor curate\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter. And yet, upon the whole, I believe she respected me more than\r\nshe herself was aware of; because I was the only person in the house\r\nwho steadily professed good principles, habitually spoke the truth, and\r\ngenerally endeavoured to make inclination bow to duty; and this I say,\r\nnot, of course, in commendation of myself, but to show the unfortunate\r\nstate of the family to which my services were, for the present,\r\ndevoted. There was no member of it in whom I regretted this sad want of\r\nprinciple so much as Miss Murray herself; not only because she had\r\ntaken a fancy to me, but because there was so much of what was pleasant\r\nand prepossessing in herself, that, in spite of her failings, I really\r\nliked her\xe2\x80\x94when she did not rouse my indignation, or ruffle my temper by\r\n_too_ great a display of her faults. These, however, I would fain\r\npersuade myself were rather the effect of her education than her\r\ndisposition: she had never been perfectly taught the distinction\r\nbetween right and wrong; she had, like her brothers and sisters, been\r\nsuffered, from infancy, to tyrannize over nurses, governesses, and\r\nservants; she had not been taught to moderate her desires, to control\r\nher temper or bridle her will, or to sacrifice her own pleasure for the\r\ngood of others. Her temper being naturally good, she was never violent\r\nor morose, but from constant indulgence, and habitual scorn of reason,\r\nshe was often testy and capricious; her mind had never been cultivated:\r\nher intellect, at best, was somewhat shallow; she possessed\r\nconsiderable vivacity, some quickness of perception, and some talent\r\nfor music and the acquisition of languages, but till fifteen she had\r\ntroubled herself to acquire nothing;\xe2\x80\x94then the love of display had\r\nroused her faculties, and induced her to apply herself, but only to the\r\nmore showy accomplishments. And when I came it was the same: everything\r\nwas neglected but French, German, music, singing, dancing, fancy-work,\r\nand a little drawing\xe2\x80\x94such drawing as might produce the greatest show\r\nwith the smallest labour, and the principal parts of which were\r\ngenerally done by me. For music and singing, besides my occasional\r\ninstructions, she had the attendance of the best master the country\r\nafforded; and in these accomplishments, as well as in dancing, she\r\ncertainly attained great proficiency. To music, indeed, she devoted too\r\nmuch of her time, as, governess though I was, I frequently told her;\r\nbut her mother thought that if _she_ liked it, she _could_ not give too\r\nmuch time to the acquisition of so attractive an art. Of fancy-work I\r\nknew nothing but what I gathered from my pupil and my own observation;\r\nbut no sooner was I initiated, than she made me useful in twenty\r\ndifferent ways: all the tedious parts of her work were shifted on to my\r\nshoulders; such as stretching the frames, stitching in the canvas,\r\nsorting the wools and silks, putting in the grounds, counting the\r\nstitches, rectifying mistakes, and finishing the pieces she was tired\r\nof.\r\n\r\nAt sixteen, Miss Murray was something of a romp, yet not more so than\r\nis natural and allowable for a girl of that age, but at seventeen, that\r\npropensity, like all other things, began to give way to the ruling\r\npassion, and soon was swallowed up in the all-absorbing ambition to\r\nattract and dazzle the other sex. But enough of her: now let us turn to\r\nher sister.\r\n\r\nMiss Matilda Murray was a veritable hoyden, of whom little need be\r\nsaid. She was about two years and a half younger than her sister; her\r\nfeatures were larger, her complexion much darker. She might possibly\r\nmake a handsome woman; but she was far too big-boned and awkward ever\r\nto be called a pretty girl, and at present she cared little about it.\r\nRosalie knew all her charms, and thought them even greater than they\r\nwere, and valued them more highly than she ought to have done, had they\r\nbeen three times as great; Matilda thought she was well enough, but\r\ncared little about the matter; still less did she care about the\r\ncultivation of her mind, and the acquisition of ornamental\r\naccomplishments. The manner in which she learnt her lessons and\r\npractised her music was calculated to drive any governess to despair.\r\nShort and easy as her tasks were, if done at all, they were slurred\r\nover, at any time and in any way; but generally at the least convenient\r\ntimes, and in the way least beneficial to herself, and least\r\nsatisfactory to me: the short half-hour of practising was horribly\r\nstrummed through; she, meantime, unsparingly abusing me, either for\r\ninterrupting her with corrections, or for not rectifying her mistakes\r\nbefore they were made, or something equally unreasonable. Once or\r\ntwice, I ventured to remonstrate with her seriously for such irrational\r\nconduct; but on each of those occasions, I received such reprehensive\r\nexpostulations from her mother, as convinced me that, if I wished to\r\nkeep the situation, I must even let Miss Matilda go on in her own way.\r\n\r\nWhen her lessons were over, however, her ill-humour was generally over\r\ntoo: while riding her spirited pony, or romping with the dogs or her\r\nbrothers and sister, but especially with her dear brother John, she was\r\nas happy as a lark. As an animal, Matilda was all right, full of life,\r\nvigour, and activity; as an intelligent being, she was barbarously\r\nignorant, indocile, careless and irrational; and, consequently, very\r\ndistressing to one who had the task of cultivating her understanding,\r\nreforming her manners, and aiding her to acquire those ornamental\r\nattainments which, unlike her sister, she despised as much as the rest.\r\nHer mother was partly aware of her deficiencies, and gave me many a\r\nlecture as to how I should try to form her tastes, and endeavour to\r\nrouse and cherish her dormant vanity; and, by insinuating, skilful\r\nflattery, to win her attention to the desired objects\xe2\x80\x94which I would not\r\ndo; and how I should prepare and smooth the path of learning till she\r\ncould glide along it without the least exertion to herself: which I\r\ncould not, for nothing can be taught to any purpose without some little\r\nexertion on the part of the learner.\r\n\r\nAs a moral agent, Matilda was reckless, headstrong, violent, and\r\nunamenable to reason. One proof of the deplorable state of her mind\r\nwas, that from her father\xe2\x80\x99s example she had learned to swear like a\r\ntrooper. Her mother was greatly shocked at the \xe2\x80\x9cunlady-like trick,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwondered \xe2\x80\x9chow she had picked it up.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can soon break her of it,\r\nMiss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said she: \xe2\x80\x9cit is only a habit; and if you will just gently\r\nremind her every time she does so, I am sure she will soon lay it\r\naside.\xe2\x80\x9d I not only \xe2\x80\x9cgently reminded\xe2\x80\x9d her, I tried to impress upon her\r\nhow wrong it was, and how distressing to the ears of decent people: but\r\nall in vain: I was only answered by a careless laugh, and, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss\r\nGrey, how shocked you are! I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad!\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cWell! I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it;\r\npapa shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taught me: I learned it all from him; and maybe a\r\nbit from the coachman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer brother John, _alias_ Master Murray, was about eleven when I came:\r\na fine, stout, healthy boy, frank and good-natured in the main, and\r\nmight have been a decent lad had he been properly educated; but now he\r\nwas as rough as a young bear, boisterous, unruly, unprincipled,\r\nuntaught, unteachable\xe2\x80\x94at least, for a governess under his mother\xe2\x80\x99s eye.\r\nHis masters at school might be able to manage him better\xe2\x80\x94for to school\r\nhe was sent, greatly to my relief, in the course of a year; in a state,\r\nit is true, of scandalous ignorance as to Latin, as well as the more\r\nuseful though more neglected things: and this, doubtless, would all be\r\nlaid to the account of his education having been entrusted to an\r\nignorant female teacher, who had presumed to take in hand what she was\r\nwholly incompetent to perform. I was not delivered from his brother\r\ntill full twelve months after, when he also was despatched in the same\r\nstate of disgraceful ignorance as the former.\r\n\r\nMaster Charles was his mother\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar darling. He was little more\r\nthan a year younger than John, but much smaller, paler, and less active\r\nand robust; a pettish, cowardly, capricious, selfish little fellow,\r\nonly active in doing mischief, and only clever in inventing falsehoods:\r\nnot simply to hide his faults, but, in mere malicious wantonness, to\r\nbring odium upon others. In fact, Master Charles was a very great\r\nnuisance to me: it was a trial of patience to live with him peaceably;\r\nto watch over him was worse; and to teach him, or pretend to teach him,\r\nwas inconceivable. At ten years old, he could not read correctly the\r\neasiest line in the simplest book; and as, according to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprinciple, he was to be told every word, before he had time to hesitate\r\nor examine its orthography, and never even to be informed, as a\r\nstimulant to exertion, that other boys were more forward than he, it is\r\nnot surprising that he made but little progress during the two years I\r\nhad charge of his education. His minute portions of Latin grammar, &c.,\r\nwere to be repeated over to him, till he chose to say he knew them, and\r\nthen he was to be helped to say them; if he made mistakes in his little\r\neasy sums in arithmetic, they were to be shown him at once, and the sum\r\ndone for him, instead of his being left to exercise his faculties in\r\nfinding them out himself; so that, of course, he took no pains to avoid\r\nmistakes, but frequently set down his figures at random, without any\r\ncalculation at all.\r\n\r\nI did not invariably confine myself to these rules: it was against my\r\nconscience to do so; but I seldom could venture to deviate from them in\r\nthe slightest degree, without incurring the wrath of my little pupil,\r\nand subsequently of his mamma; to whom he would relate my\r\ntransgressions maliciously exaggerated, or adorned with embellishments\r\nof his own; and often, in consequence, was I on the point of losing or\r\nresigning my situation. But, for their sakes at home, I smothered my\r\npride and suppressed my indignation, and managed to struggle on till my\r\nlittle tormentor was despatched to school; his father declaring that\r\nhome education was \xe2\x80\x9cno go for him, it was plain; his mother spoiled him\r\noutrageously, and his governess could make no hand of him at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few more observations about Horton Lodge and its ongoings, and I have\r\ndone with dry description for the present. The house was a very\r\nrespectable one; superior to Mr. Bloomfield\xe2\x80\x99s, both in age, size, and\r\nmagnificence: the garden was not so tastefully laid out; but instead of\r\nthe smooth-shaven lawn, the young trees guarded by palings, the grove\r\nof upstart poplars, and the plantation of firs, there was a wide park,\r\nstocked with deer, and beautified by fine old trees. The surrounding\r\ncountry itself was pleasant, as far as fertile fields, flourishing\r\ntrees, quiet green lanes, and smiling hedges with wild-flowers\r\nscattered along their banks, could make it; but it was depressingly\r\nflat to one born and nurtured among the rugged hills of \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n\r\nWe were situated nearly two miles from the village church, and,\r\nconsequently, the family carriage was put in requisition every Sunday\r\nmorning, and sometimes oftener. Mr. and Mrs. Murray generally thought\r\nit sufficient to show themselves at church once in the course of the\r\nday; but frequently the children preferred going a second time to\r\nwandering about the grounds all the day with nothing to do. If some of\r\nmy pupils chose to walk and take me with them, it was well for me; for\r\notherwise my position in the carriage was to be crushed into the corner\r\nfarthest from the open window, and with my back to the horses: a\r\nposition which invariably made me sick; and if I were not actually\r\nobliged to leave the church in the middle of the service, my devotions\r\nwere disturbed with a feeling of languor and sickliness, and the\r\ntormenting fear of its becoming worse: and a depressing headache was\r\ngenerally my companion throughout the day, which would otherwise have\r\nbeen one of welcome rest, and holy, calm enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very odd, Miss Grey, that the carriage should always make you\r\nsick: it never makes _me_,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Matilda,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor me either,\xe2\x80\x9d said her sister; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I dare say it would, if I sat\r\nwhere she does\xe2\x80\x94such a nasty, horrid place, Miss Grey; I wonder how you\r\ncan bear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am obliged to bear it, since no choice is left me,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I might have\r\nanswered; but in tenderness for their feelings I only replied,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\r\nis but a short way, and if I am not sick in church, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf I were called upon to give a description of the usual divisions and\r\narrangements of the day, I should find it a very difficult matter. I\r\nhad all my meals in the schoolroom with my pupils, at such times as\r\nsuited their fancy: sometimes they would ring for dinner before it was\r\nhalf cooked; sometimes they would keep it waiting on the table for\r\nabove an hour, and then be out of humour because the potatoes were\r\ncold, and the gravy covered with cakes of solid fat; sometimes they\r\nwould have tea at four; frequently, they would storm at the servants\r\nbecause it was not in precisely at five; and when these orders were\r\nobeyed, by way of encouragement to punctuality, they would keep it on\r\nthe table till seven or eight.\r\n\r\nTheir hours of study were managed in much the same way; my judgment or\r\nconvenience was never once consulted. Sometimes Matilda and John would\r\ndetermine \xe2\x80\x9cto get all the plaguy business over before breakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsend the maid to call me up at half-past five, without any scruple or\r\napology; sometimes, I was told to be ready precisely at six, and,\r\nhaving dressed in a hurry, came down to an empty room, and after\r\nwaiting a long time in suspense, discovered that they had changed their\r\nminds, and were still in bed; or, perhaps, if it were a fine summer\r\nmorning, Brown would come to tell me that the young ladies and\r\ngentlemen had taken a holiday, and were gone out; and then I was kept\r\nwaiting for breakfast till I was almost ready to faint: they having\r\nfortified themselves with something before they went.\r\n\r\nOften they would do their lessons in the open air; which I had nothing\r\nto say against: except that I frequently caught cold by sitting on the\r\ndamp grass, or from exposure to the evening dew, or some insidious\r\ndraught, which seemed to have no injurious effect on them. It was quite\r\nright that they should be hardy; yet, surely, they might have been\r\ntaught some consideration for others who were less so. But I must not\r\nblame them for what was, perhaps, my own fault; for I never made any\r\nparticular objections to sitting where they pleased; foolishly choosing\r\nto risk the consequences, rather than trouble them for my convenience.\r\nTheir indecorous manner of doing their lessons was quite as remarkable\r\nas the caprice displayed in their choice of time and place. While\r\nreceiving my instructions, or repeating what they had learned, they\r\nwould lounge upon the sofa, lie on the rug, stretch, yawn, talk to each\r\nother, or look out of the window; whereas, I could not so much as stir\r\nthe fire, or pick up the handkerchief I had dropped, without being\r\nrebuked for inattention by one of my pupils, or told that \xe2\x80\x9cmamma would\r\nnot like me to be so careless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe servants, seeing in what little estimation the governess was held\r\nby both parents and children, regulated their behaviour by the same\r\nstandard. I have frequently stood up for them, at the risk of some\r\ninjury to myself, against the tyranny and injustice of their young\r\nmasters and mistresses; and I always endeavoured to give them as little\r\ntrouble as possible: but they entirely neglected my comfort, despised\r\nmy requests, and slighted my directions. All servants, I am convinced,\r\nwould not have done so; but domestics in general, being ignorant and\r\nlittle accustomed to reason and reflection, are too easily corrupted by\r\nthe carelessness and bad example of those above them; and these, I\r\nthink, were not of the best order to begin with.\r\n\r\nI sometimes felt myself degraded by the life I led, and ashamed of\r\nsubmitting to so many indignities; and sometimes I thought myself a\r\nfool for caring so much about them, and feared I must be sadly wanting\r\nin Christian humility, or that charity which \xe2\x80\x9csuffereth long and is\r\nkind, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, beareth all things,\r\nendureth all things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, with time and patience, matters began to be slightly ameliorated:\r\nslowly, it is true, and almost imperceptibly; but I got rid of my male\r\npupils (that was no trifling advantage), and the girls, as I intimated\r\nbefore concerning one of them, became a little less insolent, and began\r\nto show some symptoms of esteem. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey was a queer creature: she\r\nnever flattered, and did not praise them half enough; but whenever she\r\ndid speak favourably of them, or anything belonging to them, they could\r\nbe quite sure her approbation was sincere. She was very obliging,\r\nquiet, and peaceable in the main, but there were some things that put\r\nher out of temper: they did not much care for that, to be sure, but\r\nstill it was better to keep her in tune; as when she was in a good\r\nhumour she would talk to them, and be very agreeable and amusing\r\nsometimes, in her way; which was quite different to mamma\xe2\x80\x99s, but still\r\nvery well for a change. She had her own opinions on every subject, and\r\nkept steadily to them\xe2\x80\x94very tiresome opinions they often were; as she\r\nwas always thinking of what was right and what was wrong, and had a\r\nstrange reverence for matters connected with religion, and an\r\nunaccountable liking to good people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE \xe2\x80\x9cCOMING OUT\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eighteen, Miss Murray was to emerge from the quiet obscurity of the\r\nschoolroom into the full blaze of the fashionable world\xe2\x80\x94as much of it,\r\nat least, as could be had out of London; for her papa could not be\r\npersuaded to leave his rural pleasures and pursuits, even for a few\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x99 residence in town. She was to make her _d\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xbbt_ on the third of\r\nJanuary, at a magnificent ball, which her mamma proposed to give to all\r\nthe nobility and choice gentry of O\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and its neighbourhood for twenty\r\nmiles round. Of course, she looked forward to it with the wildest\r\nimpatience, and the most extravagant anticipations of delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, one evening, a month before the all-important\r\nday, as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting letter of my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94which I had just glanced at in the morning to see that it\r\ncontained no very bad news, and kept till now, unable before to find a\r\nquiet moment for reading it,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey, do put away that dull, stupid\r\nletter, and listen to me! I\xe2\x80\x99m sure my talk must be far more amusing\r\nthan that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seated herself on the low stool at my feet; and I, suppressing a\r\nsigh of vexation, began to fold up the epistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should tell the good people at home not to bore you with such long\r\nletters,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cand, above all, do bid them write on proper\r\nnote-paper, and not on those great vulgar sheets. You should see the\r\ncharming little lady-like notes mamma writes to her friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe good people at home,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cknow very well that the longer\r\ntheir letters are, the better I like them. I should be very sorry to\r\nreceive a charming little lady-like note from any of them; and I\r\nthought you were too much of a lady yourself, Miss Murray, to talk\r\nabout the \xe2\x80\x98vulgarity\xe2\x80\x99 of writing on a large sheet of paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I only said it to tease you. But now I want to talk about the\r\nball; and to tell you that you positively must put off your holidays\r\ntill it is over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x94I shall not be present at the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but you will see the rooms decked out before it begins, and hear\r\nthe music, and, above all, see me in my splendid new dress. I shall be\r\nso charming, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to worship me\xe2\x80\x94you really must stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see you very much; but I shall have many\r\nopportunities of seeing you equally charming, on the occasion of some\r\nof the numberless balls and parties that are to be, and I cannot\r\ndisappoint my friends by postponing my return so long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind your friends! Tell them we won\xe2\x80\x99t let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, to say the truth, it would be a disappointment to myself: I long\r\nto see them as much as they to see me\xe2\x80\x94perhaps more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but it is such a short time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNearly a fortnight by my computation; and, besides, I cannot bear the\r\nthoughts of a Christmas spent from home: and, moreover, my sister is\r\ngoing to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she\xe2\x80\x94when?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot till next month; but I want to be there to assist her in making\r\npreparations, and to make the best of her company while we have her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only got the news in this letter, which you stigmatize as dull\r\nand stupid, and won\xe2\x80\x99t let me read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo whom is she to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Mr. Richardson, the vicar of a neighbouring parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; only comfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; only decent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; only middling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mercy! what a wretch! What sort of a house is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA quiet little vicarage, with an ivy-clad porch, an old-fashioned\r\ngarden, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stop!\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ll make me sick. How _can_ she bear it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect she\xe2\x80\x99ll not only be able to bear it, but to be very happy. You\r\ndid not ask me if Mr. Richardson were a good, wise, or amiable man; I\r\ncould have answered Yes, to all these questions\xe2\x80\x94at least so Mary\r\nthinks, and I hope she will not find herself mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut\xe2\x80\x94miserable creature! how can she think of spending her life there,\r\ncooped up with that nasty old man; and no hope of change?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not old: he\xe2\x80\x99s only six or seven and thirty; and she herself is\r\ntwenty-eight, and as sober as if she were fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that\xe2\x80\x99s better then\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re well matched; but do they call him the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98worthy vicar\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but if they do, I believe he merits the epithet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy, how shocking! and will she wear a white apron and make pies and\r\npuddings?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the white apron, but I dare say she will make pies\r\nand puddings now and then; but that will be no great hardship, as she\r\nhas done it before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet,\r\ncarrying tracts and bone soup to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s poor parishioners?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not clear about that; but I dare say she will do her best to make\r\nthem comfortable in body and mind, in accordance with our mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexample.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE BALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Murray, immediately I entered the\r\nschoolroom, after having taken off my outdoor garments, upon returning\r\nfrom my four weeks\xe2\x80\x99 recreation, \xe2\x80\x9cNow\xe2\x80\x94shut the door, and sit down, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you all about the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94damn it, no!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Miss Matilda. \xe2\x80\x9cHold your tongue, can\xe2\x80\x99t ye?\r\nand let me tell her about my new mare\xe2\x80\x94_such_ a splendour, Miss Grey! a\r\nfine blood mare\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo be quiet, Matilda; and let me tell my news first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Rosalie; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be such a damned long time over it\xe2\x80\x94she shall\r\nhear me first\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll be hanged if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear, Miss Matilda, that you\xe2\x80\x99ve not got rid of that\r\nshocking habit yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it: but I\xe2\x80\x99ll never say a wicked word again, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll only listen to me, and tell Rosalie to hold her confounded\r\ntongue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRosalie remonstrated, and I thought I should have been torn in pieces\r\nbetween them; but Miss Matilda having the loudest voice, her sister at\r\nlength gave in, and suffered her to tell her story first: so I was\r\ndoomed to hear a long account of her splendid mare, its breeding and\r\npedigree, its paces, its action, its spirit, &c., and of her own\r\namazing skill and courage in riding it; concluding with an assertion\r\nthat she could clear a five-barred gate \xe2\x80\x9clike winking,\xe2\x80\x9d that papa said\r\nshe might hunt the next time the hounds met, and mamma had ordered a\r\nbright scarlet hunting-habit for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Matilda! what stories you are telling!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed her sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d answered she, no whit abashed, \xe2\x80\x9cI know I _could_ clear a\r\nfive-barred gate, if I tried, and papa _will_ say I may hunt, and mamma\r\n_will_ order the habit when I ask it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now get along,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Murray; \xe2\x80\x9cand do, dear Matilda, try\r\nto be a little more lady-like. Miss Grey, I wish you would tell her not\r\nto use such shocking words; she will call her horse a mare: it is so\r\ninconceivably shocking! and then she uses such dreadful expressions in\r\ndescribing it: she must have learned it from the grooms. It nearly puts\r\nme into fits when she begins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI learned it from papa, you ass! and his jolly friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nyoung lady, vigorously cracking a hunting-whip, which she habitually\r\ncarried in her hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m as good judge of horseflesh as the best of\r\n\xe2\x80\x99m.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now get along, you shocking girl! I really shall take a fit if\r\nyou go on in such a way. And now, Miss Grey, attend to me; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ntell you about the ball. You must be dying to hear about it, I know.\r\nOh, _such_ a ball! You never saw or heard, or read, or dreamt of\r\nanything like it in all your life. The decorations, the entertainment,\r\nthe supper, the music were indescribable! and then the guests! There\r\nwere two noblemen, three baronets, and five titled ladies, and other\r\nladies and gentlemen innumerable. The ladies, of course, were of no\r\nconsequence to me, except to put me in a good humour with myself, by\r\nshowing how ugly and awkward most of them were; and the best, mamma\r\ntold me,\xe2\x80\x94the most transcendent beauties among them, were nothing to me.\r\nAs for me, Miss Grey\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m so _sorry_ you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see me! I was\r\n_charming_\xe2\x80\x94wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I, Matilda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiddling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I really was\xe2\x80\x94at least so mamma said\xe2\x80\x94and Brown and Williamson.\r\nBrown said she was sure no gentleman could set eyes on me without\r\nfalling in love that minute; and so I may be allowed to be a little\r\nvain. I know you think me a shocking, conceited, frivolous girl; but\r\nthen, you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t attribute it _all_ to my personal attractions:\r\nI give some praise to the hairdresser, and some to my exquisitely\r\nlovely dress\xe2\x80\x94you must see it to-morrow\xe2\x80\x94white gauze over pink satin\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nso _sweetly_ made! and a necklace and bracelet of beautiful, large\r\npearls!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt you looked very charming: but should that delight you\r\nso very much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no!\xe2\x80\x94not that alone: but, then, I was so much admired; and I made\r\nso _many_ conquests in that one night\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99d be astonished to hear\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what good will they do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat good! Think of any woman asking that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I should think one conquest would be enough; and too much,\r\nunless the subjugation were mutual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, but you know I never agree with you on those points. Now, wait a\r\nbit, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you my principal admirers\xe2\x80\x94those who made themselves\r\nvery conspicuous that night and after: for I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to two parties\r\nsince. Unfortunately the two noblemen, Lord G\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and Lord F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, were\r\nmarried, or I might have condescended to be particularly gracious to\r\n_them_; as it was, I did not: though Lord F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, who hates his wife, was\r\nevidently much struck with me. He asked me to dance with him twice\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nis a charming dancer, by-the-by, and so am I: you can\xe2\x80\x99t think how well\r\nI did\xe2\x80\x94I was astonished at myself. My lord was very complimentary\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94rather too much so in fact\xe2\x80\x94and I thought proper to be a little\r\nhaughty and repellent; but I had the pleasure of seeing his nasty,\r\ncross wife ready to perish with spite and vexation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Murray! you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say that such a thing could really\r\ngive you pleasure? However cross or\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s very wrong;\xe2\x80\x94but never mind! I mean to be good some\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94only don\xe2\x80\x99t preach now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good creature. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you\r\nhalf yet. Let me see. Oh! I was going to tell you how many\r\nunmistakeable admirers I had:\xe2\x80\x94Sir Thomas Ashby was one,\xe2\x80\x94Sir Hugh\r\nMeltham and Sir Broadley Wilson are old codgers, only fit companions\r\nfor papa and mamma. Sir Thomas is young, rich, and gay; but an ugly\r\nbeast, nevertheless: however, mamma says I should not mind that after a\r\nfew months\xe2\x80\x99 acquaintance. Then, there was Henry Meltham, Sir Hugh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyounger son; rather good-looking, and a pleasant fellow to flirt with:\r\nbut _being_ a younger son, that is all he is good for; then there was\r\nyoung Mr. Green, rich enough, but of no family, and a great stupid\r\nfellow, a mere country booby! and then, our good rector, Mr. Hatfield:\r\nan _humble_ admirer he ought to consider himself; but I fear he has\r\nforgotten to number humility among his stock of Christian virtues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas Mr. Hatfield at the ball?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure. Did you think he was too good to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought be might consider it unclerical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy no means. He did not profane his cloth by dancing; but it was with\r\ndifficulty he could refrain, poor man: he looked as if he were dying to\r\nask my hand just for _one_ set; and\xe2\x80\x94oh! by-the-by\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s got a new\r\ncurate: that seedy old fellow Mr. Bligh has got his long-wished-for\r\nliving at last, and is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the new one like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _such_ a beast! Weston his name is. I can give you his description\r\nin three words\xe2\x80\x94an insensate, ugly, stupid blockhead. That\xe2\x80\x99s four, but\r\nno matter\xe2\x80\x94enough of _him_ now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen she returned to the ball, and gave me a further account of her\r\ndeportment there, and at the several parties she had since attended;\r\nand further particulars respecting Sir Thomas Ashby and Messrs.\r\nMeltham, Green, and Hatfield, and the ineffaceable impression she had\r\nwrought upon each of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, which of the four do you like best?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, suppressing my\r\nthird or fourth yawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI detest them all!\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, shaking her bright ringlets in\r\nvivacious scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means, I suppose, \xe2\x80\x98I like them all\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94but which most?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I really detest them all; but Harry Meltham is the handsomest and\r\nmost amusing, and Mr. Hatfield the cleverest, Sir Thomas the wickedest,\r\nand Mr. Green the most stupid. But the one I\xe2\x80\x99m to have, I suppose, if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m doomed to have any of them, is Sir Thomas Ashby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely not, if he\xe2\x80\x99s so wicked, and if you dislike him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind his being wicked: he\xe2\x80\x99s all the better for that; and\r\nas for disliking him\xe2\x80\x94I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t greatly object to being Lady Ashby of\r\nAshby Park, if I must marry. But if I could be always young, I would be\r\nalways single. I should like to enjoy myself thoroughly, and coquet\r\nwith all the world, till I am on the verge of being called an old maid;\r\nand then, to escape the infamy of that, after having made ten thousand\r\nconquests, to break all their hearts save one, by marrying some\r\nhigh-born, rich, indulgent husband, whom, on the other hand, fifty\r\nladies were dying to have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, as long as you entertain these views, keep single by all means,\r\nand never marry at all: not even to escape the infamy of\r\nold-maidenhood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Grey, what do you think of the new curate?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss\r\nMurray, on our return from church the Sunday after the recommencement\r\nof our duties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can scarcely tell,\xe2\x80\x9d was my reply: \xe2\x80\x9cI have not even heard him\r\npreach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but you saw him, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I cannot pretend to judge of a man\xe2\x80\x99s character by a single\r\ncursory glance at his face.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t he ugly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did not strike me as being particularly so; I don\xe2\x80\x99t dislike that\r\ncast of countenance: but the only thing I particularly noticed about\r\nhim was his style of reading; which appeared to me good\xe2\x80\x94infinitely\r\nbetter, at least, than Mr. Hatfield\xe2\x80\x99s. He read the Lessons as if he\r\nwere bent on giving full effect to every passage; it seemed as if the\r\nmost careless person could not have helped attending, nor the most\r\nignorant have failed to understand; and the prayers he read as if he\r\nwere not reading at all, but praying earnestly and sincerely from his\r\nown heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s all he is good for: he can plod through the service\r\nwell enough; but he has not a single idea beyond it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know perfectly well; I am an excellent judge in such matters.\r\nDid you see how he went out of church? stumping along\xe2\x80\x94as if there were\r\nnobody there but himself\xe2\x80\x94never looking to the right hand or the left,\r\nand evidently thinking of nothing but just getting out of the church,\r\nand, perhaps, home to his dinner: his great stupid head could contain\r\nno other idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you would have had him cast a glance into the squire\xe2\x80\x99s pew,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid I, laughing at the vehemence of her hostility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! I should have been highly indignant if he had dared to do such\r\na thing!\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, haughtily tossing her head; then, after a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, she added\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well! I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99s good enough\r\nfor his place: but I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I\xe2\x80\x99m not dependent on _him_ for\r\namusement\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Did you see how Mr. Hatfield hurried out to get a\r\nbow from me, and be in time to put us into the carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered I; internally adding, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thought it somewhat\r\nderogatory to his dignity as a clergyman to come flying from the pulpit\r\nin such eager haste to shake hands with the squire, and hand his wife\r\nand daughters into their carriage: and, moreover, I owe him a grudge\r\nfor nearly shutting me out of it\xe2\x80\x9d; for, in fact, though I was standing\r\nbefore his face, close beside the carriage steps, waiting to get in, he\r\nwould persist in putting them up and closing the door, till one of the\r\nfamily stopped him by calling out that the governess was not in yet;\r\nthen, without a word of apology, he departed, wishing them\r\ngood-morning, and leaving the footman to finish the business.\r\n\r\n_Nota bene_.\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Hatfield never spoke to me, neither did Sir Hugh or\r\nLady Meltham, nor Mr. Harry or Miss Meltham, nor Mr. Green or his\r\nsisters, nor any other lady or gentleman who frequented that church:\r\nnor, in fact, any one that visited at Horton Lodge.\r\n\r\nMiss Murray ordered the carriage again, in the afternoon, for herself\r\nand her sister: she said it was too cold for them to enjoy themselves\r\nin the garden; and besides, she believed Harry Meltham would be at\r\nchurch. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smiling slyly at her own fair image in the\r\nglass, \xe2\x80\x9che has been a most exemplary attendant at church these last few\r\nSundays: you would think he was quite a good Christian. And you may go\r\nwith us, Miss Grey: I want you to see him; he is so greatly improved\r\nsince he returned from abroad\xe2\x80\x94you can\xe2\x80\x99t think! And besides, then you\r\nwill have an opportunity of seeing the beautiful Mr. Weston again, and\r\nof hearing him preach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did hear him preach, and was decidedly pleased with the evangelical\r\ntruth of his doctrine, as well as the earnest simplicity of his manner,\r\nand the clearness and force of his style. It was truly refreshing to\r\nhear such a sermon, after being so long accustomed to the dry, prosy\r\ndiscourses of the former curate, and the still less edifying harangues\r\nof the rector. Mr. Hatfield would come sailing up the aisle, or rather\r\nsweeping along like a whirlwind, with his rich silk gown flying behind\r\nhim and rustling against the pew doors, mount the pulpit like a\r\nconqueror ascending his triumphal car; then, sinking on the velvet\r\ncushion in an attitude of studied grace, remain in silent prostration\r\nfor a certain time; then mutter over a Collect, and gabble through the\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer, rise, draw off one bright lavender glove, to give the\r\ncongregation the benefit of his sparkling rings, lightly pass his\r\nfingers through his well-curled hair, flourish a cambric handkerchief,\r\nrecite a very short passage, or, perhaps, a mere phrase of Scripture,\r\nas a head-piece to his discourse, and, finally, deliver a composition\r\nwhich, as a composition, might be considered good, though far too\r\nstudied and too artificial to be pleasing to me: the propositions were\r\nwell laid down, the arguments logically conducted; and yet, it was\r\nsometimes hard to listen quietly throughout, without some slight\r\ndemonstrations of disapproval or impatience.\r\n\r\nHis favourite subjects were church discipline, rites and ceremonies,\r\napostolical succession, the duty of reverence and obedience to the\r\nclergy, the atrocious criminality of dissent, the absolute necessity of\r\nobserving all the forms of godliness, the reprehensible presumption of\r\nindividuals who attempted to think for themselves in matters connected\r\nwith religion, or to be guided by their own interpretations of\r\nScripture, and, occasionally (to please his wealthy parishioners) the\r\nnecessity of deferential obedience from the poor to the rich\xe2\x80\x94supporting\r\nhis maxims and exhortations throughout with quotations from the\r\nFathers: with whom he appeared to be far better acquainted than with\r\nthe Apostles and Evangelists, and whose importance he seemed to\r\nconsider at least equal to theirs. But now and then he gave us a sermon\r\nof a different order\xe2\x80\x94what some would call a very good one; but sunless\r\nand severe: representing the Deity as a terrible taskmaster rather than\r\na benevolent father. Yet, as I listened, I felt inclined to think the\r\nman was sincere in all he said: he must have changed his views, and\r\nbecome decidedly religious, gloomy and austere, yet still devout. But\r\nsuch illusions were usually dissipated, on coming out of church, by\r\nhearing his voice in jocund colloquy with some of the Melthams or\r\nGreens, or, perhaps, the Murrays themselves; probably laughing at his\r\nown sermon, and hoping that he had given the rascally people something\r\nto think about; perchance, exulting in the thought that old Betty\r\nHolmes would now lay aside the sinful indulgence of her pipe, which had\r\nbeen her daily solace for upwards of thirty years: that George Higgins\r\nwould be frightened out of his Sabbath evening walks, and Thomas\r\nJackson would be sorely troubled in his conscience, and shaken in his\r\nsure and certain hope of a joyful resurrection at the last day.\r\n\r\nThus, I could not but conclude that Mr. Hatfield was one of those who\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them upon men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders, while they themselves will not move them with one of their\r\nfingers\xe2\x80\x9d; and who \xe2\x80\x9cmake the word of God of none effect by their\r\ntraditions, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\xe2\x80\x9d I was well\r\npleased to observe that the new curate resembled him, as far as I could\r\nsee, in none of these particulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Grey, what do you think of him now?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Murray, as\r\nwe took our places in the carriage after service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo harm still,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo harm!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated she in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean, I think no worse of him than I did before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo worse! I should think not indeed\xe2\x80\x94quite the contrary! Is he not\r\ngreatly improved?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; very much indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I; for I had now discovered that\r\nit was Harry Meltham she meant, not Mr. Weston. That gentleman had\r\neagerly come forward to speak to the young ladies: a thing he would\r\nhardly have ventured to do had their mother been present; he had\r\nlikewise politely handed them into the carriage. He had not attempted\r\nto shut me out, like Mr. Hatfield; neither, of course, had he offered\r\nme his assistance (I should not have accepted it, if he had), but as\r\nlong as the door remained open he had stood smirking and chatting with\r\nthem, and then lifted his hat and departed to his own abode: but I had\r\nscarcely noticed him all the time. My companions, however, had been\r\nmore observant; and, as we rolled along, they discussed between them\r\nnot only his looks, words, and actions, but every feature of his face,\r\nand every article of his apparel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shan\xe2\x80\x99t have him all to yourself, Rosalie,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Matilda at\r\nthe close of this discussion; \xe2\x80\x9cI like him: I know he\xe2\x80\x99d make a nice,\r\njolly companion for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re quite welcome to him, Matilda,\xe2\x80\x9d replied her sister, in a\r\ntone of affected indifference.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m sure,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the other, \xe2\x80\x9che admires me quite as much as he\r\ndoes you; doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he, Miss Grey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I\xe2\x80\x99m not acquainted with his sentiments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but he _does_ though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy _dear_ Matilda! nobody will ever admire you till you get rid of\r\nyour rough, awkward manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, stuff! Harry Meltham likes such manners; and so do papa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you _may_ captivate old men, and younger sons; but nobody else,\r\nI am sure, will ever take a fancy to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care: I\xe2\x80\x99m not always grabbing after money, like you and mamma.\r\nIf my husband is able to keep a few good horses and dogs, I shall be\r\nquite satisfied; and all the rest may go to the devil!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you use such shocking expressions, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure no real gentleman\r\nwill ever venture to come near you. Really, Miss Grey, you should not\r\nlet her do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly prevent it, Miss Murray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x99re quite mistaken, Matilda, in supposing that Harry Meltham\r\nadmires you: I assure you he does nothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMatilda was beginning an angry reply; but, happily, our journey was now\r\nat an end; and the contention was cut short by the footman opening the\r\ncarriage-door, and letting down the steps for our descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE COTTAGERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I had now only one regular pupil\xe2\x80\x94though she contrived to give me as\r\nmuch trouble as three or four ordinary ones, and though her sister\r\nstill took lessons in German and drawing\xe2\x80\x94I had considerably more time\r\nat my own disposal than I had ever been blessed with before, since I\r\nhad taken upon me the governess\xe2\x80\x99s yoke; which time I devoted partly to\r\ncorrespondence with my friends, partly to reading, study, and the\r\npractice of music, singing, &c., partly to wandering in the grounds or\r\nadjacent fields, with my pupils if they wanted me, alone if they did\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nOften, when they had no more agreeable occupation at hand, the Misses\r\nMurray would amuse themselves with visiting the poor cottagers on their\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s estate, to receive their flattering homage, or to hear the old\r\nstories or gossiping news of the garrulous old women; or, perhaps, to\r\nenjoy the purer pleasure of making the poor people happy with their\r\ncheering presence and their occasional gifts, so easily bestowed, so\r\nthankfully received. Sometimes, I was called upon to accompany one or\r\nboth of the sisters in these visits; and sometimes I was desired to go\r\nalone, to fulfil some promise which they had been more ready to make\r\nthan to perform; to carry some small donation, or read to one who was\r\nsick or seriously disposed: and thus I made a few acquaintances among\r\nthe cottagers; and, occasionally, I went to see them on my own account.\r\n\r\nI generally had more satisfaction in going alone than with either of\r\nthe young ladies; for they, chiefly owing to their defective education,\r\ncomported themselves towards their inferiors in a manner that was\r\nhighly disagreeable for me to witness. They never, in thought,\r\nexchanged places with them; and, consequently, had no consideration for\r\ntheir feelings, regarding them as an order of beings entirely different\r\nfrom themselves. They would watch the poor creatures at their meals,\r\nmaking uncivil remarks about their food, and their manner of eating;\r\nthey would laugh at their simple notions and provincial expressions,\r\ntill some of them scarcely durst venture to speak; they would call the\r\ngrave elderly men and women old fools and silly old blockheads to their\r\nfaces: and all this without meaning to offend. I could see that the\r\npeople were often hurt and annoyed by such conduct, though their fear\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cgrand ladies\xe2\x80\x9d prevented them from testifying any resentment;\r\nbut _they_ never perceived it. They thought that, as these cottagers\r\nwere poor and untaught, they must be stupid and brutish; and as long as\r\nthey, their superiors, condescended to talk to them, and to give them\r\nshillings and half-crowns, or articles of clothing, they had a right to\r\namuse themselves, even at their expense; and the people must adore them\r\nas angels of light, condescending to minister to their necessities, and\r\nenlighten their humble dwellings.\r\n\r\nI made many and various attempts to deliver my pupils from these\r\ndelusive notions without alarming their pride\xe2\x80\x94which was easily\r\noffended, and not soon appeased\xe2\x80\x94but with little apparent result; and I\r\nknow not which was the more reprehensible of the two: Matilda was more\r\nrude and boisterous; but from Rosalie\xe2\x80\x99s womanly age and lady-like\r\nexterior better things were expected: yet she was as provokingly\r\ncareless and inconsiderate as a giddy child of twelve.\r\n\r\nOne bright day in the last week of February, I was walking in the park,\r\nenjoying the threefold luxury of solitude, a book, and pleasant\r\nweather; for Miss Matilda had set out on her daily ride, and Miss\r\nMurray was gone in the carriage with her mamma to pay some morning\r\ncalls. But it struck me that I ought to leave these selfish pleasures,\r\nand the park with its glorious canopy of bright blue sky, the west wind\r\nsounding through its yet leafless branches, the snow-wreaths still\r\nlingering in its hollows, but melting fast beneath the sun, and the\r\ngraceful deer browsing on its moist herbage already assuming the\r\nfreshness and verdure of spring\xe2\x80\x94and go to the cottage of one Nancy\r\nBrown, a widow, whose son was at work all day in the fields, and who\r\nwas afflicted with an inflammation in the eyes; which had for some time\r\nincapacitated her from reading: to her own great grief, for she was a\r\nwoman of a serious, thoughtful turn of mind. I accordingly went, and\r\nfound her alone, as usual, in her little, close, dark cottage, redolent\r\nof smoke and confined air, but as tidy and clean as she could make it.\r\nShe was seated beside her little fire (consisting of a few red cinders\r\nand a bit of stick), busily knitting, with a small sackcloth cushion at\r\nher feet, placed for the accommodation of her gentle friend the cat,\r\nwho was seated thereon, with her long tail half encircling her velvet\r\npaws, and her half-closed eyes dreamily gazing on the low, crooked\r\nfender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Nancy, how are you to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, middling, Miss, i\xe2\x80\x99 myseln\xe2\x80\x94my eyes is no better, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a deal\r\neasier i\xe2\x80\x99 my mind nor I have been,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, rising to welcome me\r\nwith a contented smile; which I was glad to see, for Nancy had been\r\nsomewhat afflicted with religious melancholy. I congratulated her upon\r\nthe change. She agreed that it was a great blessing, and expressed\r\nherself \xe2\x80\x9cright down thankful for it\xe2\x80\x9d; adding, \xe2\x80\x9cIf it please God to\r\nspare my sight, and make me so as I can read my Bible again, I think I\r\nshall be as happy as a queen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope He will, Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I; \xe2\x80\x9cand, meantime, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and read\r\nto you now and then, when I have a little time to spare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith expressions of grateful pleasure, the poor woman moved to get me a\r\nchair; but, as I saved her the trouble, she busied herself with\r\nstirring the fire, and adding a few more sticks to the decaying embers;\r\nand then, taking her well-used Bible from the shelf, dusted it\r\ncarefully, and gave it me. On my asking if there was any particular\r\npart she should like me to read, she answered\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Grey, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all the same to you, I should like to hear\r\nthat chapter in the First Epistle of St. John, that says, \xe2\x80\x98God is love,\r\nand he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a little searching, I found these words in the fourth chapter.\r\nWhen I came to the seventh verse she interrupted me, and, with needless\r\napologies for such a liberty, desired me to read it very slowly, that\r\nshe might take it all in, and dwell on every word; hoping I would\r\nexcuse her, as she was but a \xe2\x80\x9csimple body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe wisest person,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cmight think over each of these verses\r\nfor an hour, and be all the better for it; and I would rather read them\r\nslowly than not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAccordingly, I finished the chapter as slowly as need be, and at the\r\nsame time as impressively as I could; my auditor listened most\r\nattentively all the while, and sincerely thanked me when I had done. I\r\nsat still about half a minute to give her time to reflect upon it;\r\nwhen, somewhat to my surprise, she broke the pause by asking me how I\r\nliked Mr. Weston?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, a little startled by the suddenness of the\r\nquestion; \xe2\x80\x9cI think he preaches very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, he does so; and talks well too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does. Maybe, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him\xe2\x80\x94not to talk to him much, yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never see any one to talk to\xe2\x80\x94except the young ladies of the\r\nHall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh; they\xe2\x80\x99re nice, kind young ladies; but they can\xe2\x80\x99t talk as he does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he comes to see you, Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does, Miss; and I\xe2\x80\x99se thankful for it. He comes to see all us poor\r\nbodies a deal ofter nor Maister Bligh, or th\xe2\x80\x99 Rector ever did; an\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwell he does, for he\xe2\x80\x99s always welcome: we can\xe2\x80\x99t say as much for th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nRector\xe2\x80\x94there is \xe2\x80\x9cat says they\xe2\x80\x99re fair feared on him. When he comes into\r\na house, they say he\xe2\x80\x99s sure to find summut wrong, and begin a-calling\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em as soon as he crosses th\xe2\x80\x99 doorstuns: but maybe he thinks it his\r\nduty like to tell \xe2\x80\x99em what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. And very oft he comes o\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to\r\nreprove folk for not coming to church, or not kneeling an\xe2\x80\x99 standing\r\nwhen other folk does, or going to the Methody chapel, or summut o\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nsort: but I can\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x99at he ever fund much fault wi\xe2\x80\x99 me. He came to\r\nsee me once or twice, afore Maister Weston come, when I was so ill\r\ntroubled in my mind; and as I had only very poor health besides, I made\r\nbold to send for him\xe2\x80\x94and he came right enough. I was sore distressed,\r\nMiss Grey\xe2\x80\x94thank God, it\xe2\x80\x99s owered now\xe2\x80\x94but when I took my Bible, I could\r\nget no comfort of it at all. That very chapter \xe2\x80\x9cat you\xe2\x80\x99ve just been\r\nreading troubled me as much as aught\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98He that loveth not, knoweth not\r\nGod.\xe2\x80\x99 It seemed fearsome to me; for I felt that I loved neither God nor\r\nman as I should do, and could not, if I tried ever so. And th\xe2\x80\x99 chapter\r\nafore, where it says,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98He that is born of God cannot commit sin.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nanother place where it says,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Love is the fulfilling of the Law.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nmany, many others, Miss: I should fair weary you out, if I was to tell\r\nthem all. But all seemed to condemn me, and to show me \xe2\x80\x9cat I was not in\r\nthe right way; and as I knew not how to get into it, I sent our Bill to\r\nbeg Maister Hatfield to be as kind as look in on me some day and when\r\nhe came, I telled him all my troubles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did he say, Nancy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Miss, he seemed to scorn me. I might be mista\xe2\x80\x99en\xe2\x80\x94but he like gave\r\na sort of a whistle, and I saw a bit of a smile on his face; and he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s all stuff! You\xe2\x80\x99ve been among the Methodists, my good\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x99 But I telled him I\xe2\x80\x99d never been near the Methodies. And then he\r\nsaid,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98you must come to church, where you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the\r\nScriptures properly explained, instead of sitting poring over your\r\nBible at home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I telled him I always used coming to church when I had my health;\r\nbut this very cold winter weather I hardly durst venture so far\xe2\x80\x94and me\r\nso bad wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 rheumatic and all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he says, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99ll do your rheumatiz good to hobble to church:\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like exercise for the rheumatiz. You can walk about the\r\nhouse well enough; why can\xe2\x80\x99t you walk to church? The fact is,\xe2\x80\x99 says he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re getting too fond of your ease. It\xe2\x80\x99s always easy to find excuses\r\nfor shirking one\xe2\x80\x99s duty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, you know, Miss Grey, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so. However, I telled him I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntry. \xe2\x80\x98But please, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98if I do go to church, what the better\r\nshall I be? I want to have my sins blotted out, and to feel that they\r\nare remembered no more against me, and that the love of God is shed\r\nabroad in my heart; and if I can get no good by reading my Bible an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaying my prayers at home, what good shall I get by going to church?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The church,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98is the place appointed by God for His worship.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s your duty to go there as often as you can. If you want comfort,\r\nyou must seek it in the path of duty,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 a deal more he said, but I\r\ncannot remember all his fine words. However, it all came to this, that\r\nI was to come to church as oft as ever I could, and bring my\r\nprayer-book with me, an\xe2\x80\x99 read up all the sponsers after the clerk, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nstand, an\xe2\x80\x99 kneel, an\xe2\x80\x99 sit, an\xe2\x80\x99 do all as I should, and take the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSupper at every opportunity, an\xe2\x80\x99 hearken his sermons, and Maister\r\nBligh\xe2\x80\x99s, an\xe2\x80\x99 it \xe2\x80\x99ud be all right: if I went on doing my duty, I should\r\nget a blessing at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But if you get no comfort that way,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s all up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98should you think I\xe2\x80\x99m a reprobate?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 says he\xe2\x80\x94he says, \xe2\x80\x98if you do your best to get to heaven and\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t manage it, you must be one of those that seek to enter in at the\r\nstrait gate and shall not be able.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 then he asked me if I\xe2\x80\x99d seen any of the ladies o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 Hall about\r\nthat mornin\xe2\x80\x99; so I telled him where I had seen the young misses go on\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 Moss Lane;\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 he kicked my poor cat right across th\xe2\x80\x99 floor, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwent after \xe2\x80\x99em as gay as a lark: but I was very sad. That last word o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhis fair sunk into my heart, an\xe2\x80\x99 lay there like a lump o\xe2\x80\x99 lead, till I\r\nwas weary to bear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowsever, I follered his advice: I thought he meant it all for th\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbest, though he _had_ a queer way with him. But you know, Miss, he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrich an\xe2\x80\x99 young, and such like cannot right understand the thoughts of a\r\npoor old woman such as me. But, howsever, I did my best to do all as he\r\nbade me\xe2\x80\x94but maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m plaguing you, Miss, wi\xe2\x80\x99 my chatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, Nancy! Go on, and tell me all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my rheumatiz got better\xe2\x80\x94I know not whether wi\xe2\x80\x99 going to church\r\nor not, but one frosty Sunday I got this cold i\xe2\x80\x99 my eyes. Th\xe2\x80\x99\r\ninflammation didn\xe2\x80\x99t come on all at once like, but bit by bit\xe2\x80\x94but I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to tell you about my eyes, I was talking about my trouble\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 mind;\xe2\x80\x94and to tell the truth, Miss Grey, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was anyways\r\neased by coming to church\xe2\x80\x94nought to speak on, at least: I like got my\r\nhealth better; but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t mend my soul. I hearkened and hearkened\r\nthe ministers, and read an\xe2\x80\x99 read at my prayer-book; but it was all like\r\nsounding brass and a tinkling cymbal: the sermons I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand, an\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 prayer-book only served to show me how wicked I\r\nwas, that I could read such good words an\xe2\x80\x99 never be no better for it,\r\nand oftens feel it a sore labour an\xe2\x80\x99 a heavy task beside, instead of a\r\nblessing and a privilege as all good Christians does. It seemed like as\r\nall were barren an\xe2\x80\x99 dark to me. And then, them dreadful words, \xe2\x80\x98Many\r\nshall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.\xe2\x80\x99 They like as they fair\r\ndried up my sperrit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut one Sunday, when Maister Hatfield gave out about the sacrament, I\r\nnoticed where he said, \xe2\x80\x98If there be any of you that cannot quiet his\r\nown conscience, but requireth further comfort or counsel, let him come\r\nto me, or some other discreet and learned minister of God\xe2\x80\x99s word, and\r\nopen his grief!\xe2\x80\x99 So next Sunday morning, afore service, I just looked\r\ninto the vestry, an\xe2\x80\x99 began a-talking to th\xe2\x80\x99 Rector again. I hardly\r\ncould fashion to take such a liberty, but I thought when my soul was at\r\nstake I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stick at a trifle. But he said he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t time to\r\nattend to me then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And, indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to say to you but what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said\r\nbefore. Take the sacrament, of course, and go on doing your duty; and\r\nif that won\xe2\x80\x99t serve you, nothing will. So don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me any more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo then, I went away. But I heard Maister Weston\xe2\x80\x94Maister Weston was\r\nthere, Miss\xe2\x80\x94this was his first Sunday at Horton, you know, an\xe2\x80\x99 he was\r\ni\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 vestry in his surplice, helping th\xe2\x80\x99 Rector on with his gown\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Nancy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I heard him ask Maister Hatfield who I was, an\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s a canting old fool.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was very ill grieved, Miss Grey; but I went to my seat, and I\r\ntried to do my duty as aforetime: but I like got no peace. An\xe2\x80\x99 I even\r\ntook the sacrament; but I felt as though I were eating and drinking to\r\nmy own damnation all th\xe2\x80\x99 time. So I went home, sorely troubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut next day, afore I\xe2\x80\x99d gotten fettled up\xe2\x80\x94for indeed, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99d no\r\nheart to sweeping an\xe2\x80\x99 fettling, an\xe2\x80\x99 washing pots; so I sat me down i\xe2\x80\x99\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 muck\xe2\x80\x94who should come in but Maister Weston! I started siding stuff\r\nthen, an\xe2\x80\x99 sweeping an\xe2\x80\x99 doing; and I expected he\xe2\x80\x99d begin a-calling me\r\nfor my idle ways, as Maister Hatfield would a\xe2\x80\x99 done; but I was\r\nmista\xe2\x80\x99en: he only bid me good-mornin\xe2\x80\x99 like, in a quiet dacent way. So I\r\ndusted him a chair, an\xe2\x80\x99 fettled up th\xe2\x80\x99 fireplace a bit; but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nforgotten th\xe2\x80\x99 Rector\xe2\x80\x99s words, so says I, \xe2\x80\x98I wonder, sir, you should\r\ngive yourself that trouble, to come so far to see a \xe2\x80\x9ccanting old fool,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsuch as me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe seemed taken aback at that; but he would fain persuade me \xe2\x80\x9cat the\r\nRector was only in jest; and when that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do, he says, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nNancy, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think so much about it: Mr. Hatfield was a little\r\nout of humour just then: you know we\xe2\x80\x99re none of us perfect\xe2\x80\x94even Moses\r\nspoke unadvisedly with his lips. But now sit down a minute, if you can\r\nspare the time, and tell me all your doubts and fears; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to\r\nremove them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I sat me down anent him. He was quite a stranger, you know, Miss\r\nGrey, and even _younger_ nor Maister Hatfield, I believe; and I had\r\nthought him not so pleasant-looking as him, and rather a bit crossish,\r\nat first, to look at; but he spake so civil like\xe2\x80\x94and when th\xe2\x80\x99 cat, poor\r\nthing, jumped on to his knee, he only stroked her, and gave a bit of a\r\nsmile: so I thought that was a good sign; for once, when she did so to\r\nth\xe2\x80\x99 Rector, he knocked her off, like as it might be in scorn and anger,\r\npoor thing. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect a cat to know manners like a\r\nChristian, you know, Miss Grey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; of course not, Nancy. But what did Mr. Weston say then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said nought; but he listened to me as steady an\xe2\x80\x99 patient as could\r\nbe, an\xe2\x80\x99 never a bit o\xe2\x80\x99 scorn about him; so I went on, an\xe2\x80\x99 telled him\r\nall, just as I\xe2\x80\x99ve telled you\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 more too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Hatfield was quite right in telling you to\r\npersevere in doing your duty; but in advising you to go to church and\r\nattend to the service, and so on, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that was the whole of\r\na Christian\xe2\x80\x99s duty: he only thought you might there learn what more was\r\nto be done, and be led to take delight in those exercises, instead of\r\nfinding them a task and a burden. And if you had asked him to explain\r\nthose words that trouble you so much, I think he would have told you,\r\nthat if many shall seek to enter in at the strait gate and shall not be\r\nable, it is their own sins that hinder them; just as a man with a large\r\nsack on his back might wish to pass through a narrow doorway, and find\r\nit impossible to do so unless he would leave his sack behind him. But\r\nyou, Nancy, I dare say, have no sins that you would not gladly throw\r\naside, if you knew how?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Indeed, sir, you speak truth,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98you know the first and great commandment\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nsecond, which is like unto it\xe2\x80\x94on which two commandments hang all the\r\nlaw and the prophets? You say you cannot love God; but it strikes me\r\nthat if you rightly consider who and what He is, you cannot help it. He\r\nis your father, your best friend: every blessing, everything good,\r\npleasant, or useful, comes from Him; and everything evil, everything\r\nyou have reason to hate, to shun, or to fear, comes from Satan\xe2\x80\x94_His_\r\nenemy as well as ours. And for _this_ cause was God manifest in the\r\nflesh, that He might destroy the works of the Devil: in one word, God\r\nis LOVE; and the more of love we have within us, the nearer we are to\r\nHim and the more of His spirit we possess.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98if I can always think on these things, I think I\r\nmight well love God: but how can I love my neighbours, when they vex\r\nme, and be so contrary and sinful as some on \xe2\x80\x99em is?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It may seem a hard matter,\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98to love our neighbours, who\r\nhave so much of what is evil about them, and whose faults so often\r\nawaken the evil that lingers within ourselves; but remember that _He_\r\nmade them, and _He_ loves them; and whosoever loveth him that begat,\r\nloveth him that is begotten also. And if God so loveth us, that He gave\r\nHis only begotten Son to die for us, we ought also to love one another.\r\nBut if you cannot feel positive affection for those who do not care for\r\nyou, you can at least try to do to them as you would they should do\r\nunto you: you can endeavour to pity their failings and excuse their\r\noffences, and to do all the good you can to those about you. And if you\r\naccustom yourself to this, Nancy, the very effort itself will make you\r\nlove them in some degree\xe2\x80\x94to say nothing of the goodwill your kindness\r\nwould beget in them, though they might have little else that is good\r\nabout them. If we love God and wish to serve Him, let us try to be like\r\nHim, to do His work, to labour for His glory\xe2\x80\x94which is the good of\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94to hasten the coming of His kingdom, which is the peace and\r\nhappiness of all the world: however powerless we may seem to be, in\r\ndoing all the good we can through life, the humblest of us may do much\r\ntowards it: and let us dwell in love, that He may dwell in us and we in\r\nHim. The more happiness we bestow, the more we shall receive, even\r\nhere; and the greater will be our reward in heaven when we rest from\r\nour labours.\xe2\x80\x99 I believe, Miss, them is his very words, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em ower many a time. An\xe2\x80\x99 then he took that Bible, an\xe2\x80\x99 read bits here\r\nand there, an\xe2\x80\x99 explained \xe2\x80\x99em as clear as the day: and it seemed like as\r\na new light broke in on my soul; an\xe2\x80\x99 I felt fair aglow about my heart,\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 only wished poor Bill an\xe2\x80\x99 all the world could ha\xe2\x80\x99 been there, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nheard it all, and rejoiced wi\xe2\x80\x99 me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter he was gone, Hannah Rogers, one o\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 neighbours, came in and\r\nwanted me to help her to wash. I telled her I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just then, for I\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t set on th\xe2\x80\x99 potaties for th\xe2\x80\x99 dinner, nor washed up th\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast\r\nstuff yet. So then she began a-calling me for my nasty idle ways. I was\r\na little bit vexed at first, but I never said nothing wrong to her: I\r\nonly telled her like all in a quiet way, \xe2\x80\x99at I\xe2\x80\x99d had th\xe2\x80\x99 new parson to\r\nsee me; but I\xe2\x80\x99d get done as quick as ever I could, an\xe2\x80\x99 then come an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhelp her. So then she softened down; and my heart like as it warmed\r\ntowards her, an\xe2\x80\x99 in a bit we was very good friends. An\xe2\x80\x99 so it is, Miss\r\nGrey, \xe2\x80\x98a soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up\r\nanger.\xe2\x80\x99 It isn\xe2\x80\x99t only in them you speak to, but in yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true, Nancy, if we could always remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, if we could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did Mr. Weston ever come to see you again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, many a time; and since my eyes has been so bad, he\xe2\x80\x99s sat an\xe2\x80\x99 read\r\nto me by the half-hour together: but you know, Miss, he has other folks\r\nto see, and other things to do\xe2\x80\x94God bless him! An\xe2\x80\x99 that next Sunday he\r\npreached _such_ a sermon! His text was, \xe2\x80\x98Come unto me all ye that\r\nlabour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,\xe2\x80\x99 and them two\r\nblessed verses that follows. You wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, Miss, you was with your\r\nfriends then\xe2\x80\x94but it made me _so_ happy! And I _am_ happy now, thank\r\nGod! an\xe2\x80\x99 I take a pleasure, now, in doing little bits o\xe2\x80\x99 jobs for my\r\nneighbours\xe2\x80\x94such as a poor old body \xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s half blind can do; and they\r\ntake it kindly of me, just as he said. You see, Miss, I\xe2\x80\x99m knitting a\r\npair o\xe2\x80\x99 stockings now;\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re for Thomas Jackson: he\xe2\x80\x99s a queerish old\r\nbody, an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ve had many a bout at threaping, one anent t\xe2\x80\x99other; an\xe2\x80\x99 at\r\ntimes we\xe2\x80\x99ve differed sorely. So I thought I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do better nor knit\r\nhim a pair o\xe2\x80\x99 warm stockings; an\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt to like him a deal better,\r\npoor old man, sin\xe2\x80\x99 I began. It\xe2\x80\x99s turned out just as Maister Weston\r\nsaid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad to see you so happy, Nancy, and so wise: but I\r\nmust go now; I shall be wanted at the Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; and bidding her\r\ngood-bye, I departed, promising to come again when I had time, and\r\nfeeling nearly as happy as herself.\r\n\r\nAt another time I went to read to a poor labourer who was in the last\r\nstage of consumption. The young ladies had been to see him, and somehow\r\na promise of reading had been extracted from them; but it was too much\r\ntrouble, so they begged me to do it instead. I went, willingly enough;\r\nand there too I was gratified with the praises of Mr. Weston, both from\r\nthe sick man and his wife. The former told me that he derived great\r\ncomfort and benefit from the visits of the new parson, who frequently\r\ncame to see him, and was \xe2\x80\x9canother guess sort of man\xe2\x80\x9d to Mr. Hatfield;\r\nwho, before the other\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at Horton, had now and then paid him a\r\nvisit; on which occasions he would always insist upon having the\r\ncottage-door kept open, to admit the fresh air for his own convenience,\r\nwithout considering how it might injure the sufferer; and having opened\r\nhis prayer-book and hastily read over a part of the Service for the\r\nSick, would hurry away again: if he did not stay to administer some\r\nharsh rebuke to the afflicted wife, or to make some thoughtless, not to\r\nsay heartless, observation, rather calculated to increase than diminish\r\nthe troubles of the suffering pair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereas,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cMaister Weston \xe2\x80\x99ull pray with me quite in a\r\ndifferent fashion, an\xe2\x80\x99 talk to me as kind as owt; an\xe2\x80\x99 oft read to me\r\ntoo, an\xe2\x80\x99 sit beside me just like a brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust for all the world!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed his wife; \xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x80\x99 about a three wik\r\nsin\xe2\x80\x99, when he seed how poor Jem shivered wi\xe2\x80\x99 cold, an\xe2\x80\x99 what pitiful\r\nfires we kept, he axed if wer stock of coals was nearly done. I telled\r\nhim it was, an\xe2\x80\x99 we was ill set to get more: but you know, mum, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink o\xe2\x80\x99 him helping us; but, howsever, he sent us a sack o\xe2\x80\x99 coals next\r\nday; an\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ve had good fires ever sin\xe2\x80\x99: and a great blessing it is,\r\nthis winter time. But that\xe2\x80\x99s his way, Miss Grey: when he comes into a\r\npoor body\xe2\x80\x99s house a-seein\xe2\x80\x99 sick folk, he like notices what they most\r\nstand i\xe2\x80\x99 need on; an\xe2\x80\x99 if he thinks they can\xe2\x80\x99t readily get it therseln,\r\nhe never says nowt about it, but just gets it for \xe2\x80\x99em. An\xe2\x80\x99 it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\neverybody \xe2\x80\x99at \xe2\x80\x99ud do that, \xe2\x80\x99at has as little as he has: for you know,\r\nmum, he\xe2\x80\x99s nowt at all to live on but what he gets fra\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 Rector, an\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s little enough they say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI remembered then, with a species of exultation, that he had frequently\r\nbeen styled a vulgar brute by the amiable Miss Murray, because he wore\r\na silver watch, and clothes not quite so bright and fresh as Mr.\r\nHatfield\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIn returning to the Lodge I felt very happy, and thanked God that I had\r\nnow something to think about; something to dwell on as a relief from\r\nthe weary monotony, the lonely drudgery, of my present life: for I\r\n_was_ lonely. Never, from month to month, from year to year, except\r\nduring my brief intervals of rest at home, did I see one creature to\r\nwhom I could open my heart, or freely speak my thoughts with any hope\r\nof sympathy, or even comprehension: never one, unless it were poor\r\nNancy Brown, with whom I could enjoy a single moment of real social\r\nintercourse, or whose conversation was calculated to render me better,\r\nwiser, or happier than before; or who, as far as I could see, could be\r\ngreatly benefited by mine. My only companions had been unamiable\r\nchildren, and ignorant, wrong-headed girls; from whose fatiguing folly,\r\nunbroken solitude was often a relief most earnestly desired and dearly\r\nprized. But to be restricted to such associates was a serious evil,\r\nboth in its immediate effects and the consequences that were likely to\r\nensue. Never a new idea or stirring thought came to me from without;\r\nand such as rose within me were, for the most part, miserably crushed\r\nat once, or doomed to sicken or fade away, because they could not see\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nHabitual associates are known to exercise a great influence over each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s minds and manners. Those whose actions are for ever before our\r\neyes, whose words are ever in our ears, will naturally lead us, albeit\r\nagainst our will, slowly, gradually, imperceptibly, perhaps, to act and\r\nspeak as they do. I will not presume to say how far this irresistible\r\npower of assimilation extends; but if one civilised man were doomed to\r\npass a dozen years amid a race of intractable savages, unless he had\r\npower to improve them, I greatly question whether, at the close of that\r\nperiod, he would not have become, at least, a barbarian himself. And I,\r\nas I could not make my young companions better, feared exceedingly that\r\nthey would make me worse\xe2\x80\x94would gradually bring my feelings, habits,\r\ncapacities, to the level of their own; without, however, imparting to\r\nme their lightheartedness and cheerful vivacity.\r\n\r\nAlready, I seemed to feel my intellect deteriorating, my heart\r\npetrifying, my soul contracting; and I trembled lest my very moral\r\nperceptions should become deadened, my distinctions of right and wrong\r\nconfounded, and all my better faculties be sunk, at last, beneath the\r\nbaneful influence of such a mode of life. The gross vapours of earth\r\nwere gathering around me, and closing in upon my inward heaven; and\r\nthus it was that Mr. Weston rose at length upon me, appearing like the\r\nmorning star in my horizon, to save me from the fear of utter darkness;\r\nand I rejoiced that I had now a subject for contemplation that was\r\nabove me, not beneath. I was glad to see that all the world was not\r\nmade up of Bloomfields, Murrays, Hatfields, Ashbys, &c.; and that human\r\nexcellence was not a mere dream of the imagination. When we hear a\r\nlittle good and no harm of a person, it is easy and pleasant to imagine\r\nmore: in short, it is needless to analyse all my thoughts; but Sunday\r\nwas now become a day of peculiar delight to me (I was now almost\r\nbroken-in to the back corner in the carriage), for I liked to hear\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and I liked to see him, too; though I knew he was not handsome, or\r\neven what is called agreeable, in outward aspect; but, certainly, he\r\nwas not ugly.\r\n\r\nIn stature he was a little, a very little, above the middle size; the\r\noutline of his face would be pronounced too square for beauty, but to\r\nme it announced decision of character; his dark brown hair was not\r\ncarefully curled, like Mr. Hatfield\xe2\x80\x99s, but simply brushed aside over a\r\nbroad white forehead; the eyebrows, I suppose, were too projecting, but\r\nfrom under those dark brows there gleamed an eye of singular power,\r\nbrown in colour, not large, and somewhat deep-set, but strikingly\r\nbrilliant, and full of expression; there was character, too, in the\r\nmouth, something that bespoke a man of firm purpose and an habitual\r\nthinker; and when he smiled\xe2\x80\x94but I will not speak of that yet, for, at\r\nthe time I mention, I had never seen him smile: and, indeed, his\r\ngeneral appearance did not impress me with the idea of a man given to\r\nsuch a relaxation, nor of such an individual as the cottagers described\r\nhim. I had early formed my opinion of him; and, in spite of Miss\r\nMurray\xe2\x80\x99s objurgations: was fully convinced that he was a man of strong\r\nsense, firm faith, and ardent piety, but thoughtful and stern: and when\r\nI found that, to his other good qualities, was added that of true\r\nbenevolence and gentle, considerate kindness, the discovery, perhaps,\r\ndelighted me the more, as I had not been prepared to expect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE SHOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in March:\r\nfor, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I seldom could\r\nlook upon an hour as entirely my own; since, where everything was left\r\nto the caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister, there could be no order\r\nor regularity. Whatever occupation I chose, when not actually busied\r\nabout them or their concerns, I had, as it were, to keep my loins\r\ngirded, my shoes on my feet, and my staff in my hand; for not to be\r\nimmediately forthcoming when called for, was regarded as a grave and\r\ninexcusable offence: not only by my pupils and their mother, but by the\r\nvery servant, who came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re to go to the schoolroom _directly_, mum, the young ladies is\r\nWAITING!!\xe2\x80\x9d Climax of horror! actually waiting for their governess!!!\r\n\r\nBut this time I was pretty sure of an hour or two to myself; for\r\nMatilda was preparing for a long ride, and Rosalie was dressing for a\r\ndinner-party at Lady Ashby\xe2\x80\x99s: so I took the opportunity of repairing to\r\nthe widow\xe2\x80\x99s cottage, where I found her in some anxiety about her cat,\r\nwhich had been absent all day. I comforted her with as many anecdotes\r\nof that animal\xe2\x80\x99s roving propensities as I could recollect. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m feared\r\no\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 gamekeepers,\xe2\x80\x9d said she: \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all \xe2\x80\x99at I think on. If th\xe2\x80\x99 young\r\ngentlemen had been at home, I should a\xe2\x80\x99 thought they\xe2\x80\x99d been setting\r\ntheir dogs at her, an\xe2\x80\x99 worried her, poor thing, as they did _many_ a\r\npoor thing\xe2\x80\x99s cat; but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t that to be feared on now.\xe2\x80\x9d Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\r\nwere better, but still far from well: she had been trying to make a\r\nSunday shirt for her son, but told me she could only bear to do a\r\nlittle bit at it now and then, so that it progressed but slowly, though\r\nthe poor lad wanted it sadly. So I proposed to help her a little, after\r\nI had read to her, for I had plenty of time that evening, and need not\r\nreturn till dusk. She thankfully accepted the offer. \xe2\x80\x9cAn\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a\r\nbit o\xe2\x80\x99 company for me too, Miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cI like as I feel lonesome\r\nwithout my cat.\xe2\x80\x9d But when I had finished reading, and done the half of\r\na seam, with Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s capacious brass thimble fitted on to my finger by\r\nmeans of a roll of paper, I was disturbed by the entrance of Mr.\r\nWeston, with the identical cat in his arms. I now saw that he could\r\nsmile, and very pleasantly too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done you a piece of good service, Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d he began: then seeing\r\nme, he acknowledged my presence by a slight bow. I should have been\r\ninvisible to Hatfield, or any other gentleman of those parts. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndelivered your cat,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the hands, or rather the gun,\r\nof Mr. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s gamekeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the grateful old woman, ready to weep for\r\njoy as she received her favourite from his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t let it go near the\r\nrabbit-warren, for the gamekeeper swears he\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot it if he sees it\r\nthere again: he would have done so to-day, if I had not been in time to\r\nstop him. I believe it is raining, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, more quietly,\r\nobserving that I had put aside my work, and was preparing to depart.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let me disturb you\xe2\x80\x94I shan\xe2\x80\x99t stay two minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll _both_ stay while this shower gets owered,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nancy, as she\r\nstirred the fire, and placed another chair beside it; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat! there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can see better here, thank you, Nancy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, taking my work to\r\nthe window, where she had the goodness to suffer me to remain\r\nunmolested, while she got a brush to remove the cat\xe2\x80\x99s hairs from Mr.\r\nWeston\xe2\x80\x99s coat, carefully wiped the rain from his hat, and gave the cat\r\nits supper, busily talking all the time: now thanking her clerical\r\nfriend for what he had done; now wondering how the cat had found out\r\nthe warren; and now lamenting the probable consequences of such a\r\ndiscovery. He listened with a quiet, good-natured smile, and at length\r\ntook a seat in compliance with her pressing invitations, but repeated\r\nthat he did not mean to stay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have another place to go to,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I see\xe2\x80\x9d (glancing at the\r\nbook on the table) \xe2\x80\x9csomeone else has been reading to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; Miss Grey has been as kind as read me a chapter; an\xe2\x80\x99 now\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s helping me with a shirt for our Bill\xe2\x80\x94but I\xe2\x80\x99m feared she\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\ncold there. Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come to th\xe2\x80\x99 fire, Miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, Nancy, I\xe2\x80\x99m quite warm. I must go as soon as this shower\r\nis over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss! You said you could stop while dusk!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the provoking old\r\nwoman, and Mr. Weston seized his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNay, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she, \xe2\x80\x9cpray don\xe2\x80\x99t go now, while it rains so fast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it strikes me I\xe2\x80\x99m keeping your visitor away from the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re not, Mr. Weston,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, hoping there was no harm in a\r\nfalsehood of that description.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sure!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Nancy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, there\xe2\x80\x99s lots o\xe2\x80\x99 room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, half-jestingly, as if he felt it necessary to\r\nchange the present subject, whether he had anything particular to say\r\nor not, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would make my peace with the squire, when you see\r\nhim. He was by when I rescued Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s cat, and did not quite approve of\r\nthe deed. I told him I thought he might better spare all his rabbits\r\nthan she her cat, for which audacious assertion he treated me to some\r\nrather ungentlemanly language; and I fear I retorted a trifle too\r\nwarmly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, lawful sir! I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t fall out wi\xe2\x80\x99 th\xe2\x80\x99 maister for sake o\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmy cat! he cannot bide answering again\xe2\x80\x94can th\xe2\x80\x99 maister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s no matter, Nancy: I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about it, really; I said\r\nnothing _very_ uncivil; and I suppose Mr. Murray is accustomed to use\r\nrather strong language when he\xe2\x80\x99s heated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, sir: it\xe2\x80\x99s a pity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, I really must go. I have to visit a place a mile beyond this;\r\nand you would not have me to return in the dark: besides, it has nearly\r\ndone raining now\xe2\x80\x94so good-evening, Nancy. Good-evening, Miss Grey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-evening, Mr. Weston; but don\xe2\x80\x99t depend upon me for making your\r\npeace with Mr. Murray, for I never see him\xe2\x80\x94to speak to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be helped then,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, in dolorous\r\nresignation: then, with a peculiar half-smile, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cBut never\r\nmind; I imagine the squire has more to apologise for than I;\xe2\x80\x9d and left\r\nthe cottage.\r\n\r\nI went on with my sewing as long as I could see, and then bade Nancy\r\ngood-evening; checking her too lively gratitude by the undeniable\r\nassurance that I had only done for her what she would have done for me,\r\nif she had been in my place and I in hers. I hastened back to Horton\r\nLodge, where, having entered the schoolroom, I found the tea-table all\r\nin confusion, the tray flooded with slops, and Miss Matilda in a most\r\nferocious humour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey, whatever have you been about? I\xe2\x80\x99ve had tea half an hour\r\nago, and had to make it myself, and drink it all alone! I wish you\r\nwould come in sooner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see Nancy Brown. I thought you would not be back from\r\nyour ride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I ride in the rain, I should like to know. That damned\r\npelting shower was vexatious enough\xe2\x80\x94coming on when I was just in full\r\nswing: and then to come and find nobody in to tea! and you know I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake the tea as I like it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think of the shower,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I (and, indeed, the thought of\r\nits driving her home had never entered my head).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of course; you were under shelter yourself, and you never thought\r\nof other people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bore her coarse reproaches with astonishing equanimity, even with\r\ncheerfulness; for I was sensible that I had done more good to Nancy\r\nBrown than harm to her: and perhaps some other thoughts assisted to\r\nkeep up my spirits, and impart a relish to the cup of cold, overdrawn\r\ntea, and a charm to the otherwise unsightly table; and\xe2\x80\x94I had almost\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94to Miss Matilda\xe2\x80\x99s unamiable face. But she soon betook herself to\r\nthe stables, and left me to the quiet enjoyment of my solitary meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nTHE PRIMROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Murray now always went twice to church, for she so loved\r\nadmiration that she could not bear to lose a single opportunity of\r\nobtaining it; and she was so sure of it wherever she showed herself,\r\nthat, whether Harry Meltham and Mr. Green were there or not, there was\r\ncertain to be somebody present who would not be insensible to her\r\ncharms, besides the Rector, whose official capacity generally obliged\r\nhim to attend. Usually, also, if the weather permitted, both she and\r\nher sister would walk home; Matilda, because she hated the confinement\r\nof the carriage; she, because she disliked the privacy of it, and\r\nenjoyed the company that generally enlivened the first mile of the\r\njourney in walking from the church to Mr. Green\xe2\x80\x99s park-gates: near\r\nwhich commenced the private road to Horton Lodge, which lay in the\r\nopposite direction, while the highway conducted in a straightforward\r\ncourse to the still more distant mansion of Sir Hugh Meltham. Thus\r\nthere was always a chance of being accompanied, so far, either by Harry\r\nMeltham, with or without Miss Meltham, or Mr. Green, with perhaps one\r\nor both of his sisters, and any gentlemen visitors they might have.\r\n\r\nWhether I walked with the young ladies or rode with their parents,\r\ndepended upon their own capricious will: if they chose to \xe2\x80\x9ctake\xe2\x80\x9d me, I\r\nwent; if, for reasons best known to themselves, they chose to go alone,\r\nI took my seat in the carriage. I liked walking better, but a sense of\r\nreluctance to obtrude my presence on anyone who did not desire it,\r\nalways kept me passive on these and similar occasions; and I never\r\ninquired into the causes of their varying whims. Indeed, this was the\r\nbest policy\xe2\x80\x94for to submit and oblige was the governess\xe2\x80\x99s part, to\r\nconsult their own pleasure was that of the pupils. But when I did walk,\r\nthe first half of journey was generally a great nuisance to me. As none\r\nof the before-mentioned ladies and gentlemen ever noticed me, it was\r\ndisagreeable to walk beside them, as if listening to what they said, or\r\nwishing to be thought one of them, while they talked over me, or\r\nacross; and if their eyes, in speaking, chanced to fall on me, it\r\nseemed as if they looked on vacancy\xe2\x80\x94as if they either did not see me,\r\nor were very desirous to make it appear so. It was disagreeable, too,\r\nto walk behind, and thus appear to acknowledge my own inferiority; for,\r\nin truth, I considered myself pretty nearly as good as the best of\r\nthem, and wished them to know that I did so, and not to imagine that I\r\nlooked upon myself as a mere domestic, who knew her own place too well\r\nto walk beside such fine ladies and gentlemen as they were\xe2\x80\x94though her\r\nyoung ladies might choose to have her with them, and even condescend to\r\nconverse with her when no better company were at hand. Thus\xe2\x80\x94I am almost\r\nashamed to confess it\xe2\x80\x94but indeed I gave myself no little trouble in my\r\nendeavours (if I did keep up with them) to appear perfectly unconscious\r\nor regardless of their presence, as if I were wholly absorbed in my own\r\nreflections, or the contemplation of surrounding objects; or, if I\r\nlingered behind, it was some bird or insect, some tree or flower, that\r\nattracted my attention, and having duly examined that, I would pursue\r\nmy walk alone, at a leisurely pace, until my pupils had bidden adieu to\r\ntheir companions and turned off into the quiet private road.\r\n\r\nOne such occasion I particularly well remember; it was a lovely\r\nafternoon about the close of March; Mr. Green and his sisters had sent\r\ntheir carriage back empty, in order to enjoy the bright sunshine and\r\nbalmy air in a sociable walk home along with their visitors, Captain\r\nSomebody and Lieutenant Somebody-else (a couple of military fops), and\r\nthe Misses Murray, who, of course, contrived to join them. Such a party\r\nwas highly agreeable to Rosalie; but not finding it equally suitable to\r\nmy taste, I presently fell back, and began to botanise and entomologise\r\nalong the green banks and budding hedges, till the company was\r\nconsiderably in advance of me, and I could hear the sweet song of the\r\nhappy lark; then my spirit of misanthropy began to melt away beneath\r\nthe soft, pure air and genial sunshine; but sad thoughts of early\r\nchildhood, and yearnings for departed joys, or for a brighter future\r\nlot, arose instead. As my eyes wandered over the steep banks covered\r\nwith young grass and green-leaved plants, and surmounted by budding\r\nhedges, I longed intensely for some familiar flower that might recall\r\nthe woody dales or green hill-sides of home: the brown moorlands, of\r\ncourse, were out of the question. Such a discovery would make my eyes\r\ngush out with water, no doubt; but that was one of my greatest\r\nenjoyments now. At length I descried, high up between the twisted roots\r\nof an oak, three lovely primroses, peeping so sweetly from their\r\nhiding-place that the tears already started at the sight; but they grew\r\nso high above me, that I tried in vain to gather one or two, to dream\r\nover and to carry with me: I could not reach them unless I climbed the\r\nbank, which I was deterred from doing by hearing a footstep at that\r\nmoment behind me, and was, therefore, about to turn away, when I was\r\nstartled by the words, \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to gather them for you, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nspoken in the grave, low tones of a well-known voice. Immediately the\r\nflowers were gathered, and in my hand. It was Mr. Weston, of course\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nelse would trouble himself to do so much for _me_?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thanked him; whether warmly or coldly, I cannot tell: but certain I\r\nam that I did not express half the gratitude I felt. It was foolish,\r\nperhaps, to feel any gratitude at all; but it seemed to me, at that\r\nmoment, as if this were a remarkable instance of his good-nature: an\r\nact of kindness, which I could not repay, but never should forget: so\r\nutterly unaccustomed was I to receive such civilities, so little\r\nprepared to expect them from anyone within fifty miles of Horton Lodge.\r\nYet this did not prevent me from feeling a little uncomfortable in his\r\npresence; and I proceeded to follow my pupils at a much quicker pace\r\nthan before; though, perhaps, if Mr. Weston had taken the hint, and let\r\nme pass without another word, I might have repeated it an hour after:\r\nbut he did not. A somewhat rapid walk for me was but an ordinary pace\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour young ladies have left you alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are occupied with more agreeable company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble yourself to overtake them.\xe2\x80\x9d I slackened my pace;\r\nbut next moment regretted having done so: my companion did not speak;\r\nand I had nothing in the world to say, and feared he might be in the\r\nsame predicament. At length, however, he broke the pause by asking,\r\nwith a certain quiet abruptness peculiar to himself, if I liked\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; very much,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cwild-flowers especially.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_I_ like wild-flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cothers I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about, because I\r\nhave no particular associations connected with them\xe2\x80\x94except one or two.\r\nWhat are your favourite flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrimroses, bluebells, and heath-blossoms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot violets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; because, as you say, I have no particular associations connected\r\nwith them; for there are no sweet violets among the hills and valleys\r\nround my home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be a great consolation to you to have a home, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nobserved my companion after a short pause: \xe2\x80\x9chowever remote, or however\r\nseldom visited, still it is something to look to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so much that I think I could not live without it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I,\r\nwith an enthusiasm of which I immediately repented; for I thought it\r\nmust have sounded essentially silly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, you could,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a thoughtful smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ties that\r\nbind us to life are tougher than you imagine, or than anyone can who\r\nhas not felt how roughly they may be pulled without breaking. You might\r\nbe miserable without a home, but even _you_ could live; and not so\r\nmiserably as you suppose. The human heart is like india-rubber; a\r\nlittle swells it, but a great deal will not burst it. If \xe2\x80\x98little more\r\nthan nothing will disturb it, little less than all things will suffice\xe2\x80\x99\r\nto break it. As in the outer members of our frame, there is a vital\r\npower inherent in itself that strengthens it against external violence.\r\nEvery blow that shakes it will serve to harden it against a future\r\nstroke; as constant labour thickens the skin of the hand, and\r\nstrengthens its muscles instead of wasting them away: so that a day of\r\narduous toil, that might excoriate a lady\xe2\x80\x99s palm, would make no\r\nsensible impression on that of a hardy ploughman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI speak from experience\xe2\x80\x94partly my own. There was a time when I thought\r\nas you do\xe2\x80\x94at least, I was fully persuaded that home and its affections\r\nwere the only things that made life tolerable: that, if deprived of\r\nthese, existence would become a burden hard to be endured; but now I\r\nhave no home\xe2\x80\x94unless you would dignify my two hired rooms at Horton by\r\nsuch a name;\xe2\x80\x94and not twelve months ago I lost the last and dearest of\r\nmy early friends; and yet, not only I live, but I am not wholly\r\ndestitute of hope and comfort, even for this life: though I must\r\nacknowledge that I can seldom enter even an humble cottage at the close\r\nof day, and see its inhabitants peaceably gathered around their\r\ncheerful hearth, without a feeling _almost_ of envy at their domestic\r\nenjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happiness lies before you yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said I: \xe2\x80\x9cyou are\r\nnow only in the commencement of your journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best of happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cis mine already\xe2\x80\x94the power and the\r\nwill to be useful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe now approached a stile communicating with a footpath that conducted\r\nto a farm-house, where, I suppose, Mr. Weston purposed to make himself\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cuseful;\xe2\x80\x9d for he presently took leave of me, crossed the stile, and\r\ntraversed the path with his usual firm, elastic tread, leaving me to\r\nponder his words as I continued my course alone. I had heard before\r\nthat he had lost his mother not many months before he came. She then\r\nwas the last and dearest of his early friends; and he had _no home_. I\r\npitied him from my heart: I almost wept for sympathy. And this, I\r\nthought, accounted for the shade of premature thoughtfulness that so\r\nfrequently clouded his brow, and obtained for him the reputation of a\r\nmorose and sullen disposition with the charitable Miss Murray and all\r\nher kin. \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9che is not so miserable as I should be under\r\nsuch a deprivation: he leads an active life; and a wide field for\r\nuseful exertion lies before him. He can _make_ friends; and he can make\r\na home too, if he pleases; and, doubtless, he will please some time.\r\nGod grant the partner of that home may be worthy of his choice, and\r\nmake it a happy one\xe2\x80\x94such a home as he deserves to have! And how\r\ndelightful it would be to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d But no matter what I thought.\r\n\r\nI began this book with the intention of concealing nothing; that those\r\nwho liked might have the benefit of perusing a fellow-creature\xe2\x80\x99s heart:\r\nbut we have some thoughts that all the angels in heaven are welcome to\r\nbehold, but not our brother-men\xe2\x80\x94not even the best and kindest amongst\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Greens had taken themselves to their own abode, and\r\nthe Murrays had turned down the private road, whither I hastened to\r\nfollow them. I found the two girls warm in an animated discussion on\r\nthe respective merits of the two young officers; but on seeing me\r\nRosalie broke off in the middle of a sentence to exclaim, with\r\nmalicious glee\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-ho, Miss Grey! you\xe2\x80\x99re come at last, are you? No _wonder_ you\r\nlingered so long behind; and no _wonder_ you always stand up so\r\nvigorously for Mr. Weston when I abuse him. Ah-ha! I see it all now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, come, Miss Murray, don\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, attempting a\r\ngood-natured laugh; \xe2\x80\x9cyou know such nonsense can make no impression on\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut she still went on talking such intolerable stuff\xe2\x80\x94her sister helping\r\nher with appropriate fiction coined for the occasion\xe2\x80\x94that I thought it\r\nnecessary to say something in my own justification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat folly all this is!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s road happened\r\nto be the same as mine for a few yards, and if he chose to exchange a\r\nword or two in passing, what is there so remarkable in that? I assure\r\nyou, I never spoke to him before: except once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? where? and when?\xe2\x80\x9d cried they eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s cottage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh-ha! you\xe2\x80\x99ve met him there, have you?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Rosalie, with\r\nexultant laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! now, Matilda, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found out why she\xe2\x80\x99s so fond\r\nof going to Nancy Brown\xe2\x80\x99s! She goes there to flirt with Mr. Weston.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, that is not worth contradicting\xe2\x80\x94I only saw him there once, I\r\ntell you\xe2\x80\x94and how could I know he was coming?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIrritated as I was at their foolish mirth and vexatious imputations,\r\nthe uneasiness did not continue long: when they had had their laugh\r\nout, they returned again to the captain and lieutenant; and, while they\r\ndisputed and commented upon them, my indignation rapidly cooled; the\r\ncause of it was quickly forgotten, and I turned my thoughts into a\r\npleasanter channel. Thus we proceeded up the park, and entered the\r\nhall; and as I ascended the stairs to my own chamber, I had but one\r\nthought within me: my heart was filled to overflowing with one single\r\nearnest wish. Having entered the room, and shut the door, I fell upon\r\nmy knees and offered up a fervent but not impetuous prayer: \xe2\x80\x9cThy will\r\nbe done,\xe2\x80\x9d I strove to say throughout; but, \xe2\x80\x9cFather, all things are\r\npossible with Thee, and may it be Thy will,\xe2\x80\x9d was sure to follow. That\r\nwish\xe2\x80\x94that prayer\xe2\x80\x94both men and women would have scorned me for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\r\nFather, _Thou_ wilt _not_ despise!\xe2\x80\x9d I said, and felt that it was true.\r\nIt seemed to me that another\xe2\x80\x99s welfare was at least as ardently\r\nimplored for as my own; nay, even _that_ was the principal object of my\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x99s desire. I might have been deceiving myself; but that idea gave\r\nme confidence to ask, and power to hope I did not ask in vain. As for\r\nthe primroses, I kept two of them in a glass in my room until they were\r\ncompletely withered, and the housemaid threw them out; and the petals\r\nof the other I pressed between the leaves of my Bible\xe2\x80\x94I have them\r\nstill, and mean to keep them always.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE RECTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day was as fine as the preceding one. Soon after\r\nbreakfast Miss Matilda, having galloped and blundered through a few\r\nunprofitable lessons, and vengeably thumped the piano for an hour, in a\r\nterrible humour with both me and it, because her mamma would not give\r\nher a holiday, had betaken herself to her favourite places of resort,\r\nthe yards, the stables, and the dog-kennels; and Miss Murray was gone\r\nforth to enjoy a quiet ramble with a new fashionable novel for her\r\ncompanion, leaving me in the schoolroom hard at work upon a\r\nwater-colour drawing which I had promised to do for her, and which she\r\ninsisted upon my finishing that day.\r\n\r\nAt my feet lay a little rough terrier. It was the property of Miss\r\nMatilda; but she hated the animal, and intended to sell it, alleging\r\nthat it was quite spoiled. It was really an excellent dog of its kind;\r\nbut she affirmed it was fit for nothing, and had not even the sense to\r\nknow its own mistress.\r\n\r\nThe fact was she had purchased it when but a small puppy, insisting at\r\nfirst that no one should touch it but herself; but soon becoming tired\r\nof so helpless and troublesome a nursling, she had gladly yielded to my\r\nentreaties to be allowed to take charge of it; and I, by carefully\r\nnursing the little creature from infancy to adolescence, of course, had\r\nobtained its affections: a reward I should have greatly valued, and\r\nlooked upon as far outweighing all the trouble I had had with it, had\r\nnot poor Snap\xe2\x80\x99s grateful feelings exposed him to many a harsh word and\r\nmany a spiteful kick and pinch from his owner, and were he not now in\r\ndanger of being \xe2\x80\x9cput away\xe2\x80\x9d in consequence, or transferred to some\r\nrough, stony-hearted master. But how could I help it? I could not make\r\nthe dog hate me by cruel treatment, and she would not propitiate him by\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nHowever, while I thus sat, working away with my pencil, Mrs. Murray\r\ncame, half-sailing, half-bustling, into the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d she began,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdear! how can you sit at your drawing such a\r\nday as this?\xe2\x80\x9d (She thought I was doing it for my own pleasure.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n_wonder_ you don\xe2\x80\x99t put on your bonnet and go out with the young\r\nladies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Miss Murray is reading; and Miss Matilda is amusing\r\nherself with her dogs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would try to amuse Miss Matilda yourself a little more, I think\r\nshe would not be driven to seek amusement in the companionship of dogs\r\nand horses and grooms, so much as she is; and if you would be a little\r\nmore cheerful and conversable with Miss Murray, she would not so often\r\ngo wandering in the fields with a book in her hand. However, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to vex you,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, seeing, I suppose, that my cheeks burned\r\nand my hand trembled with some unamiable emotion. \xe2\x80\x9cDo, pray, try not to\r\nbe so touchy\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no speaking to you else. And tell me if you know\r\nwhere Rosalie is gone: and why she likes to be so much alone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe says she likes to be alone when she has a new book to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why can\xe2\x80\x99t she read it in the park or the garden?\xe2\x80\x94why should she go\r\ninto the fields and lanes? And how is it that that Mr. Hatfield so\r\noften finds her out? She told me last week he\xe2\x80\x99d walked his horse by her\r\nside all up Moss Lane; and now I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it was he I saw, from my\r\ndressing-room window, walking so briskly past the park-gates, and on\r\ntowards the field where she so frequently goes. I wish you would go and\r\nsee if she is there; and just gently remind her that it is not proper\r\nfor a young lady of her rank and prospects to be wandering about by\r\nherself in that manner, exposed to the attentions of anyone that\r\npresumes to address her; like some poor neglected girl that has no park\r\nto walk in, and no friends to take care of her: and tell her that her\r\npapa would be extremely angry if he knew of her treating Mr. Hatfield\r\nin the familiar manner that I fear she does; and\xe2\x80\x94oh! if you\xe2\x80\x94if _any_\r\ngoverness had but half a mother\xe2\x80\x99s watchfulness\xe2\x80\x94half a mother\xe2\x80\x99s anxious\r\ncare, I should be saved this trouble; and you would see at once the\r\nnecessity of keeping your eye upon her, and making your company\r\nagreeable to\xe2\x80\x94 Well, go\xe2\x80\x94go; there\xe2\x80\x99s no time to be lost,\xe2\x80\x9d cried she,\r\nseeing that I had put away my drawing materials, and was waiting in the\r\ndoorway for the conclusion of her address.\r\n\r\nAccording to her prognostications, I found Miss Murray in her favourite\r\nfield just without the park; and, unfortunately, not alone; for the\r\ntall, stately figure of Mr. Hatfield was slowly sauntering by her side.\r\n\r\nHere was a poser for me. It was my duty to interrupt the _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_:\r\nbut how was it to be done? Mr. Hatfield could not to be driven away by\r\nso insignificant person as I; and to go and place myself on the other\r\nside of Miss Murray, and intrude my unwelcome presence upon her without\r\nnoticing her companion, was a piece of rudeness I could not be guilty\r\nof: neither had I the courage to cry aloud from the top of the field\r\nthat she was wanted elsewhere. So I took the intermediate course of\r\nwalking slowly but steadily towards them; resolving, if my approach\r\nfailed to scare away the beau, to pass by and tell Miss Murray her\r\nmamma wanted her.\r\n\r\nShe certainly looked very charming as she strolled, lingering along\r\nunder the budding horse-chestnut trees that stretched their long arms\r\nover the park-palings; with her closed book in one hand, and in the\r\nother a graceful sprig of myrtle, which served her as a very pretty\r\nplaything; her bright ringlets escaping profusely from her little\r\nbonnet, and gently stirred by the breeze, her fair cheek flushed with\r\ngratified vanity, her smiling blue eyes, now slyly glancing towards her\r\nadmirer, now gazing downward at her myrtle sprig. But Snap, running\r\nbefore me, interrupted her in the midst of some half-pert, half-playful\r\nrepartee, by catching hold of her dress and vehemently tugging thereat;\r\ntill Mr. Hatfield, with his cane, administered a resounding thwack upon\r\nthe animal\xe2\x80\x99s skull, and sent it yelping back to me with a clamorous\r\noutcry that afforded the reverend gentleman great amusement: but seeing\r\nme so near, he thought, I suppose, he might as well be taking his\r\ndeparture; and, as I stooped to caress the dog, with ostentatious pity\r\nto show my disapproval of his severity, I heard him say: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall I\r\nsee you again, Miss Murray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt church, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, \xe2\x80\x9cunless your business chances to\r\nbring you here again at the precise moment when I happen to be walking\r\nby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could always manage to have business here, if I knew precisely when\r\nand where to find you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I would, I could not inform you, for I am so immethodical, I\r\nnever can tell to-day what I shall do to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen give me that, meantime, to comfort me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, half jestingly\r\nand half in earnest, extending his hand for the sprig of myrtle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, I shan\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo! _pray_ do! I shall be the most miserable of men if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. You\r\ncannot be so cruel as to deny me a favour so easily granted and yet so\r\nhighly prized!\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded he as ardently as if his life depended on it.\r\n\r\nBy this time I stood within a very few yards of them, impatiently\r\nwaiting his departure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere then! take it and go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosalie.\r\n\r\nHe joyfully received the gift, murmured something that made her blush\r\nand toss her head, but with a little laugh that showed her displeasure\r\nwas entirely affected; and then with a courteous salutation withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see such a man, Miss Grey?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning to me; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nso _glad_ you came! I thought I never _should_ get rid of him; and I\r\nwas so terribly afraid of papa seeing him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he been with you long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not long, but he\xe2\x80\x99s so extremely impertinent: and he\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nhanging about, pretending his business or his clerical duties require\r\nhis attendance in these parts, and really watching for poor me, and\r\npouncing upon me wherever he sees me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your mamma thinks you ought not to go beyond the park or garden\r\nwithout some discreet, matronly person like me to accompany you, and\r\nkeep off all intruders. She descried Mr. Hatfield hurrying past the\r\npark-gates, and forthwith despatched me with instructions to seek you\r\nup and to take care of you, and likewise to warn\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, mamma\xe2\x80\x99s so tiresome! As if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take care of myself. She\r\nbothered me before about Mr. Hatfield; and I told her she might trust\r\nme: I never should forget my rank and station for the most delightful\r\nman that ever breathed. I wish he would go down on his knees to-morrow,\r\nand implore me to be his wife, that I might just show her how mistaken\r\nshe is in supposing that I could ever\xe2\x80\x94Oh, it provokes me so! To think\r\nthat I could be such a fool as to fall in _love_! It is quite beneath\r\nthe dignity of a woman to do such a thing. Love! I detest the word! As\r\napplied to one of our sex, I think it a perfect insult. A preference I\r\n_might_ acknowledge; but never for one like poor Mr. Hatfield, who has\r\nnot seven hundred a year to bless himself with. I like to talk to him,\r\nbecause he\xe2\x80\x99s so clever and amusing\xe2\x80\x94I wish Sir Thomas Ashby were half as\r\nnice; besides, I must have _somebody_ to flirt with, and no one else\r\nhas the sense to come here; and when we go out, mamma won\xe2\x80\x99t let me\r\nflirt with anybody but Sir Thomas\xe2\x80\x94if he\xe2\x80\x99s there; and if he\xe2\x80\x99s _not_\r\nthere, I\xe2\x80\x99m bound hand and foot, for fear somebody should go and make up\r\nsome exaggerated story, and put it into his head that I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged, or\r\nlikely to be engaged, to somebody else; or, what is more probable, for\r\nfear his nasty old mother should see or hear of my ongoings, and\r\nconclude that I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fit wife for her excellent son: as if the said\r\nson were not the greatest scamp in Christendom; and as if any woman of\r\ncommon decency were not a world too good for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really so, Miss Murray? and does your mamma know it, and yet\r\nwish you to marry him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure, she does! She knows more against him than I do, I believe:\r\nshe keeps it from me lest I should be discouraged; not knowing how\r\nlittle I care about such things. For it\xe2\x80\x99s no great matter, really:\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right when he\xe2\x80\x99s married, as mamma says; and reformed rakes\r\nmake the best husbands, _everybody_ knows. I only wish he were not so\r\nugly\xe2\x80\x94_that\xe2\x80\x99s_ all _I_ think about: but then there\xe2\x80\x99s no choice here in\r\nthe country; and papa _will not_ let us go to London\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I should think Mr. Hatfield would be far better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so he would, if he were lord of Ashby Park\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s not a doubt of\r\nit: but the fact is, I _must_ have Ashby Park, whoever shares it with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Hatfield thinks you like him all this time; you don\xe2\x80\x99t consider\r\nhow bitterly he will be disappointed when he finds himself mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No_, indeed! It will be a proper punishment for his presumption\xe2\x80\x94for\r\never _daring_ to think I could like him. I should enjoy nothing so much\r\nas lifting the veil from his eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sooner you do it the better then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I tell you, I like to amuse myself with him. Besides, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nreally think I like him. I take good care of that: you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\ncleverly I manage. He may presume to think he can induce me to like\r\nhim; for which I shall punish him as he deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t give too much reason for such presumption\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I.\r\n\r\nBut all my exhortations were in vain: they only made her somewhat more\r\nsolicitous to disguise her wishes and her thoughts from me. She talked\r\nno more to me about the Rector; but I could see that her mind, if not\r\nher heart, was fixed upon him still, and that she was intent upon\r\nobtaining another interview: for though, in compliance with her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s request, I was now constituted the companion of her rambles\r\nfor a time, she still persisted in wandering in the fields and lanes\r\nthat lay in the nearest proximity to the road; and, whether she talked\r\nto me or read the book she carried in her hand, she kept continually\r\npausing to look round her, or gaze up the road to see if anyone was\r\ncoming; and if a horseman trotted by, I could tell by her unqualified\r\nabuse of the poor equestrian, whoever he might be, that she hated him\r\n_because_ he was not Mr. Hatfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is not so indifferent to him as she believes\r\nherself to be, or would have others to believe her; and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nanxiety is not so wholly causeless as she affirms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThree days passed away, and he did not make his appearance. On the\r\nafternoon of the fourth, as we were walking beside the park-palings in\r\nthe memorable field, each furnished with a book (for I always took care\r\nto provide myself with something to be doing when she did not require\r\nme to talk), she suddenly interrupted my studies by exclaiming\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Miss Grey! do be so kind as to go and see Mark Wood, and take his\r\nwife half-a-crown from me\xe2\x80\x94I should have given or sent it a week ago,\r\nbut quite forgot. There!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, throwing me her purse, and speaking\r\nvery fast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind getting it out now, but take the purse and give\r\nthem what you like; I would go with you, but I want to finish this\r\nvolume. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and meet you when I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it. Be quick, will\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94oh, wait; hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you better read to him a bit? Run to the house\r\nand get some sort of a good book. Anything will do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did as I was desired; but, suspecting something from her hurried\r\nmanner and the suddenness of the request, I just glanced back before I\r\nquitted the field, and there was Mr. Hatfield about to enter at the\r\ngate below. By sending me to the house for a book, she had just\r\nprevented my meeting him on the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind!\xe2\x80\x9d thought I, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99ll be no great harm done. Poor Mark\r\nwill be glad of the half-crown, and perhaps of the good book too; and\r\nif the Rector does steal Miss Rosalie\xe2\x80\x99s heart, it will only humble her\r\npride a little; and if they do get married at last, it will only save\r\nher from a worse fate; and she will be quite a good enough partner for\r\nhim, and he for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMark Wood was the consumptive labourer whom I mentioned before. He was\r\nnow rapidly wearing away. Miss Murray, by her liberality, obtained\r\nliterally the blessing of him that was ready to perish; for though the\r\nhalf-crown could be of very little service to him, he was glad of it\r\nfor the sake of his wife and children, so soon to be widowed and\r\nfatherless. After I had sat a few minutes, and read a little for the\r\ncomfort and edification of himself and his afflicted wife, I left them;\r\nbut I had not proceeded fifty yards before I encountered Mr. Weston,\r\napparently on his way to the same abode. He greeted me in his usual\r\nquiet, unaffected way, stopped to inquire about the condition of the\r\nsick man and his family, and with a sort of unconscious, brotherly\r\ndisregard to ceremony took from my hand the book out of which I had\r\nbeen reading, turned over its pages, made a few brief but very sensible\r\nremarks, and restored it; then told me about some poor sufferer he had\r\njust been visiting, talked a little about Nancy Brown, made a few\r\nobservations upon my little rough friend the terrier, that was frisking\r\nat his feet, and finally upon the beauty of the weather, and departed.\r\n\r\nI have omitted to give a detail of his words, from a notion that they\r\nwould not interest the reader as they did me, and not because I have\r\nforgotten them. No; I remember them well; for I thought them over and\r\nover again in the course of that day and many succeeding ones, I know\r\nnot how often; and recalled every intonation of his deep, clear voice,\r\nevery flash of his quick, brown eye, and every gleam of his pleasant,\r\nbut too transient smile. Such a confession will look very absurd, I\r\nfear: but no matter: I have written it: and they that read it will not\r\nknow the writer.\r\n\r\nWhile I was walking along, happy within, and pleased with all around,\r\nMiss Murray came hastening to meet me; her buoyant step, flushed cheek,\r\nand radiant smiles showing that she, too, was happy, in her own way.\r\nRunning up to me, she put her arm through mine, and without waiting to\r\nrecover breath, began\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Grey, think yourself highly honoured,\r\nfor I\xe2\x80\x99m come to tell you my news before I\xe2\x80\x99ve breathed a word of it to\r\nanyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _such_ news! In the first place, you must know that Mr. Hatfield\r\ncame upon me just after you were gone. I was in such a way for fear\r\npapa or mamma should see him; but you know I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t call you back\r\nagain, and so!\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear! I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you all about it now, for there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMatilda, I see, in the park, and I must go and open my budget to her.\r\nBut, however, Hatfield was most uncommonly audacious, unspeakably\r\ncomplimentary, and unprecedentedly tender\xe2\x80\x94tried to be so, at least\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed very well in _that_, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not his vein. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ntell you all he said another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did _you_ say\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m more interested in that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that, too, at some future period. I happened to be in a\r\nvery good humour just then; but, though I was complaisant and gracious\r\nenough, I took care not to compromise myself in any possible way. But,\r\nhowever, the conceited wretch chose to interpret my amiability of\r\ntemper his own way, and at length presumed upon my indulgence so\r\nfar\xe2\x80\x94what do you think?\xe2\x80\x94he actually made me an offer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI proudly drew myself up, and with the greatest coolness expressed my\r\nastonishment at such an occurrence, and hoped he had seen nothing in my\r\nconduct to justify his expectations. You should have _seen_ how his\r\ncountenance fell! He went perfectly white in the face. I assured him\r\nthat I esteemed him and all that, but could not possibly accede to his\r\nproposals; and if I did, papa and mamma could never be brought to give\r\ntheir consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But if they could,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98would yours be wanting?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Certainly, Mr. Hatfield,\xe2\x80\x99 I replied, with a cool decision which\r\nquelled all hope at once. Oh, if you had seen how dreadfully mortified\r\nhe was\xe2\x80\x94how crushed to the earth by his disappointment! really, I almost\r\npitied him myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more desperate attempt, however, he made. After a silence of\r\nconsiderable duration, during which he struggled to be calm, and I to\r\nbe grave\xe2\x80\x94for I felt a strong propensity to laugh\xe2\x80\x94which would have\r\nruined all\xe2\x80\x94he said, with the ghost of a smile\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98But tell me plainly,\r\nMiss Murray, if I had the wealth of Sir Hugh Meltham, or the prospects\r\nof his eldest son, would you still refuse me? Answer me truly, upon\r\nyour honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98That would make no difference whatever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great lie, but he looked so confident in his own attractions\r\nstill, that I determined not to leave him one stone upon another. He\r\nlooked me full in the face; but I kept my countenance so well that he\r\ncould not imagine I was saying anything more than the actual truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then it\xe2\x80\x99s all over, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking as if he could have\r\ndied on the spot with vexation and the intensity of his despair. But he\r\nwas angry as well as disappointed. There was he, suffering so\r\nunspeakably, and there was I, the pitiless cause of it all, so utterly\r\nimpenetrable to all the artillery of his looks and words, so calmly\r\ncold and proud, he could not but feel some resentment; and with\r\nsingular bitterness he began\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I certainly did not expect this, Miss\r\nMurray. I might say something about your past conduct, and the hopes\r\nyou have led me to foster, but I forbear, on condition\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No conditions, Mr. Hatfield!\xe2\x80\x99 said I, now truly indignant at his\r\ninsolence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then let me beg it as a favour,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, lowering his voice at\r\nonce, and taking a humbler tone: \xe2\x80\x98let me entreat that you will not\r\nmention this affair to anyone whatever. If you will keep silence about\r\nit, there need be no unpleasantness on either side\xe2\x80\x94nothing, I mean,\r\nbeyond what is quite unavoidable: for my own feelings I will endeavour\r\nto keep to myself, if I cannot annihilate them\xe2\x80\x94I will try to forgive,\r\nif I cannot forget the cause of my sufferings. I will not suppose, Miss\r\nMurray, that you know how deeply you have injured me. I would not have\r\nyou aware of it; but if, in addition to the injury you have already\r\ndone me\xe2\x80\x94pardon me, but, whether innocently or not, you _have_ done\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and if you add to it by giving publicity to this unfortunate affair,\r\nor naming it _at all_, you will find that I too can speak, and though\r\nyou scorned my love, you will hardly scorn my\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stopped, but he bit his bloodless lip, and looked so terribly\r\nfierce that I was quite frightened. However, my pride upheld me still,\r\nand I answered disdainfully; \xe2\x80\x98I do not know what motive you suppose I\r\ncould have for naming it to anyone, Mr. Hatfield; but if I were\r\ndisposed to do so, you would not deter me by threats; and it is\r\nscarcely the part of a gentleman to attempt it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pardon me, Miss Murray,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I have loved you so intensely\xe2\x80\x94I do\r\nstill adore you so deeply, that I would not willingly offend you; but\r\nthough I never have loved, and never _can_ love any woman as I have\r\nloved you, it is equally certain that I never was so ill-treated by\r\nany. On the contrary, I have always found your sex the kindest and most\r\ntender and obliging of God\xe2\x80\x99s creation, till now.\xe2\x80\x99 (Think of the\r\nconceited fellow saying that!) \xe2\x80\x98And the novelty and harshness of the\r\nlesson you have taught me to-day, and the bitterness of being\r\ndisappointed in the only quarter on which the happiness of my life\r\ndepended, must excuse any appearance of asperity. If my presence is\r\ndisagreeable to you, Miss Murray,\xe2\x80\x99 he said (for I was looking about me\r\nto show how little I cared for him, so he thought I was tired of him, I\r\nsuppose)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98if my presence is disagreeable to you, Miss Murray, you have\r\nonly to promise me the favour I named, and I will relieve you at once.\r\nThere are many ladies\xe2\x80\x94some even in this parish\xe2\x80\x94who would be delighted\r\nto accept what you have so scornfully trampled under your feet. They\r\nwould be naturally inclined to hate one whose surpassing loveliness has\r\nso completely estranged my heart from them and blinded me to their\r\nattractions; and a single hint of the truth from me to one of these\r\nwould be sufficient to raise such a talk against you as would seriously\r\ninjure your prospects, and diminish your chance of success with any\r\nother gentleman you or your mamma might design to entangle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What do your mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 said I, ready to stamp with passion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I mean that this affair from beginning to end appears to me like a\r\ncase of arrant flirtation, to say the least of it\xe2\x80\x94such a case as you\r\nwould find it rather inconvenient to have blazoned through the world:\r\nespecially with the additions and exaggerations of your female rivals,\r\nwho would be too glad to publish the matter, if I only gave them a\r\nhandle to it. But I promise you, on the faith of a gentleman, that no\r\nword or syllable that could tend to your prejudice shall ever escape my\r\nlips, provided you will\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Well, well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention it,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98You may rely upon my\r\nsilence, if that can afford you any consolation.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You promise it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered; for I wanted to get rid of him now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Farewell, then!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, in a most doleful, heart-sick tone; and\r\nwith a look where pride vainly struggled against despair, he turned and\r\nwent away: longing, no doubt, to get home, that he might shut himself\r\nup in his study and cry\xe2\x80\x94if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t burst into tears before he gets\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have broken your promise already,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, truly horrified at\r\nher perfidy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! it\xe2\x80\x99s only to you; I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t repeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, I shall not: but you say you are going to tell your sister;\r\nand she will tell your brothers when they come home, and Brown\r\nimmediately, if you do not tell her yourself; and Brown will blazon it,\r\nor be the means of blazoning it, throughout the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, she won\xe2\x80\x99t. We shall not tell her at all, unless it be\r\nunder the promise of the strictest secrecy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can you expect her to keep her promises better than her more\r\nenlightened mistress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, she shan\xe2\x80\x99t hear it then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Murray, somewhat\r\nsnappishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will tell your mamma, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued I; \xe2\x80\x9cand she will\r\ntell your papa.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I shall tell mamma\xe2\x80\x94that is the very thing that pleases me so\r\nmuch. I shall now be able to convince her how mistaken she was in her\r\nfears about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ it, is it? I was wondering what it was that delighted you\r\nso much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and another thing is, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve humbled Mr. Hatfield so\r\ncharmingly; and another\xe2\x80\x94why, you must allow me some share of female\r\nvanity: I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be without that most essential attribute of\r\nour sex\xe2\x80\x94and if you had seen poor Hatfield\xe2\x80\x99s intense eagerness in making\r\nhis ardent declaration and his flattering proposal, and his agony of\r\nmind, that no effort of pride could conceal, on being refused, you\r\nwould have allowed I had some cause to be gratified.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe greater his agony, I should think, the less your cause for\r\ngratification.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the young lady, shaking herself with vexation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou either can\xe2\x80\x99t understand me, or you won\xe2\x80\x99t. If I had not confidence\r\nin your magnanimity, I should think you envied me. But you will,\r\nperhaps, comprehend this cause of pleasure\xe2\x80\x94which is as great as\r\nany\xe2\x80\x94namely, that I am delighted with myself for my prudence, my\r\nself-command, my heartlessness, if you please. I was not a bit taken by\r\nsurprise, not a bit confused, or awkward, or foolish; I just acted and\r\nspoke as I ought to have done, and was completely my own mistress\r\nthroughout. And here was a man, decidedly good-looking\xe2\x80\x94Jane and Susan\r\nGreen call him bewitchingly handsome\xe2\x80\x94I suppose they\xe2\x80\x99re two of the\r\nladies he pretends would be so glad to have him; but, however, he was\r\ncertainly a very clever, witty, agreeable companion\xe2\x80\x94not what you call\r\nclever, but just enough to make him entertaining; and a man one needn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe ashamed of anywhere, and would not soon grow tired of; and to\r\nconfess the truth, I rather liked him\xe2\x80\x94better even, of late, than Harry\r\nMeltham\xe2\x80\x94and he evidently idolised me; and yet, though he came upon me\r\nall alone and unprepared, I had the wisdom, and the pride, and the\r\nstrength to refuse him\xe2\x80\x94and so scornfully and coolly as I did: I have\r\ngood reason to be proud of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you equally proud of having told him that his having the\r\nwealth of Sir Hugh Meltham would make no difference to you, when that\r\nwas not the case; and of having promised to tell no one of his\r\nmisadventure, apparently without the slightest intention of keeping\r\nyour promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course! what else could I do? You would not have had me\xe2\x80\x94but I see,\r\nMiss Grey, you\xe2\x80\x99re not in a good temper. Here\xe2\x80\x99s Matilda; I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what\r\nshe and mamma have to say about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe left me, offended at my want of sympathy, and thinking, no doubt,\r\nthat I envied her. I did not\xe2\x80\x94at least, I firmly believed I did not. I\r\nwas sorry for her; I was amazed, disgusted at her heartless vanity; I\r\nwondered why so much beauty should be given to those who made so bad a\r\nuse of it, and denied to some who would make it a benefit to both\r\nthemselves and others.\r\n\r\nBut, God knows best, I concluded. There are, I suppose, some men as\r\nvain, as selfish, and as heartless as she is, and, perhaps, such women\r\nmay be useful to punish them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nTHE WALK\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear! I wish Hatfield had not been so precipitate!\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosalie\r\nnext day at four P.M., as, with a portentous yawn, she laid down her\r\nworsted-work and looked listlessly towards the window. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no\r\ninducement to go out now; and nothing to look forward to. The days will\r\nbe so long and dull when there are no parties to enliven them; and\r\nthere are none this week, or next either, that I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPity you were so cross to him,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Matilda, to whom this\r\nlamentation was addressed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never come again: and I suspect you\r\nliked him after all. I hoped you would have taken him for your beau,\r\nand left dear Harry to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumph! my beau must be an Adonis indeed, Matilda, the admired of all\r\nbeholders, if I am to be contented with him alone. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to lose\r\nHatfield, I confess; but the first decent man, or number of men, that\r\ncome to supply his place, will be more than welcome. It\xe2\x80\x99s Sunday\r\nto-morrow\xe2\x80\x94I do wonder how he\xe2\x80\x99ll look, and whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to go\r\nthrough the service. Most likely he\xe2\x80\x99ll pretend he\xe2\x80\x99s got a cold, and\r\nmake Mr. Weston do it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot he!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Matilda, somewhat contemptuously. \xe2\x80\x9cFool as he is,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s not so soft as that comes to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer sister was slightly offended; but the event proved Matilda was\r\nright: the disappointed lover performed his pastoral duties as usual.\r\nRosalie, indeed, affirmed he looked very pale and dejected: he might be\r\na little paler; but the difference, if any, was scarcely perceptible.\r\nAs for his dejection, I certainly did not hear his laugh ringing from\r\nthe vestry as usual, nor his voice loud in hilarious discourse; though\r\nI did hear it uplifted in rating the sexton in a manner that made the\r\ncongregation stare; and, in his transits to and from the pulpit and the\r\ncommunion-table, there was more of solemn pomp, and less of that\r\nirreverent, self-confident, or rather self-delighted imperiousness with\r\nwhich he usually swept along\xe2\x80\x94that air that seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou all\r\nreverence and adore me, I know; but if anyone does not, I defy him to\r\nthe teeth!\xe2\x80\x9d But the most remarkable change was, that he never once\r\nsuffered his eyes to wander in the direction of Mr. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s pew, and\r\ndid not leave the church till we were gone.\r\n\r\nMr. Hatfield had doubtless received a very severe blow; but his pride\r\nimpelled him to use every effort to conceal the effects of it. He had\r\nbeen disappointed in his certain hope of obtaining not only a\r\nbeautiful, and, to him, highly attractive wife, but one whose rank and\r\nfortune might give brilliance to far inferior charms: he was likewise,\r\nno doubt, intensely mortified by his repulse, and deeply offended at\r\nthe conduct of Miss Murray throughout. It would have given him no\r\nlittle consolation to have known how disappointed she was to find him\r\napparently so little moved, and to see that he was able to refrain from\r\ncasting a single glance at her throughout both services; though, she\r\ndeclared, it showed he was thinking of her all the time, or his eyes\r\nwould have fallen upon her, if it were only by chance: but if they had\r\nso chanced to fall, she would have affirmed it was because they could\r\nnot resist the attraction. It might have pleased him, too, in some\r\ndegree, to have seen how dull and dissatisfied she was throughout that\r\nweek (the greater part of it, at least), for lack of her usual source\r\nof excitement; and how often she regretted having \xe2\x80\x9cused him up so\r\nsoon,\xe2\x80\x9d like a child that, having devoured its plumcake too hastily,\r\nsits sucking its fingers, and vainly lamenting its greediness.\r\n\r\nAt length I was called upon, one fine morning, to accompany her in a\r\nwalk to the village. Ostensibly she went to get some shades of Berlin\r\nwool, at a tolerably respectable shop that was chiefly supported by the\r\nladies of the vicinity: really\xe2\x80\x94I trust there is no breach of charity in\r\nsupposing that she went with the idea of meeting either with the Rector\r\nhimself, or some other admirer by the way; for as we went along, she\r\nkept wondering \xe2\x80\x9cwhat Hatfield would do or say, if we met him,\xe2\x80\x9d &c. &c.;\r\nas we passed Mr. Green\xe2\x80\x99s park-gates, she \xe2\x80\x9cwondered whether he was at\r\nhome\xe2\x80\x94great stupid blockhead\xe2\x80\x9d; as Lady Meltham\xe2\x80\x99s carriage passed us, she\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwondered what Mr. Harry was doing this fine day\xe2\x80\x9d; and then began to\r\nabuse his elder brother for being \xe2\x80\x9csuch a fool as to get married and go\r\nand live in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you wanted to live in London yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because it\xe2\x80\x99s so dull here: but then he makes it still duller by\r\ntaking himself off: and if he were not married I might have him instead\r\nof that odious Sir Thomas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, observing the prints of a horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet on the somewhat miry road,\r\nshe \xe2\x80\x9cwondered whether it was a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s horse,\xe2\x80\x9d and finally\r\nconcluded it was, for the impressions were too small to have been made\r\nby a \xe2\x80\x9cgreat clumsy cart-horse\xe2\x80\x9d; and then she \xe2\x80\x9cwondered who the rider\r\ncould be,\xe2\x80\x9d and whether we should meet him coming back, for she was sure\r\nhe had only passed that morning; and lastly, when we entered the\r\nvillage and saw only a few of its humble inhabitants moving about, she\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwondered why the stupid people couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep in their houses; she was\r\nsure she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see their ugly faces, and dirty, vulgar\r\nclothes\xe2\x80\x94it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for that she came to Horton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmid all this, I confess, I wondered, too, in secret, whether we should\r\nmeet, or catch a glimpse of somebody else; and as we passed his\r\nlodgings, I even went so far as to wonder whether he was at the window.\r\nOn entering the shop, Miss Murray desired me to stand in the doorway\r\nwhile she transacted her business, and tell her if anyone passed. But\r\nalas! there was no one visible besides the villagers, except Jane and\r\nSusan Green coming down the single street, apparently returning from a\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid things!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered she, as she came out after having concluded\r\nher bargain. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they have their dolt of a brother with them?\r\neven he would be better than nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe greeted them, however, with a cheerful smile, and protestations of\r\npleasure at the happy meeting equal to their own. They placed\r\nthemselves one on each side of her, and all three walked away chatting\r\nand laughing as young ladies do when they get together, if they be but\r\non tolerably intimate terms. But I, feeling myself to be one too many,\r\nleft them to their merriment and lagged behind, as usual on such\r\noccasions: I had no relish for walking beside Miss Green or Miss Susan\r\nlike one deaf and dumb, who could neither speak nor be spoken to.\r\n\r\nBut this time I was not long alone. It struck me, first, as very odd,\r\nthat just as I was thinking about Mr. Weston he should come up and\r\naccost me; but afterwards, on due reflection, I thought there was\r\nnothing odd about it, unless it were the fact of his speaking to me;\r\nfor on such a morning and so near his own abode, it was natural enough\r\nthat he should be about; and as for my thinking of him, I had been\r\ndoing that, with little intermission, ever since we set out on our\r\njourney; so there was nothing remarkable in that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are alone again, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of people are those ladies\xe2\x80\x94the Misses Green?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s strange\xe2\x80\x94when you live so near and see them so often!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose they are lively, good-tempered girls; but I imagine\r\nyou must know them better than I do, yourself, for I never exchanged a\r\nword with either of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? They don\xe2\x80\x99t strike me as being particularly reserved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely they are not so to people of their own class; but they\r\nconsider themselves as moving in quite a different sphere from me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe made no reply to this: but after a short pause, he said,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s these things, Miss Grey, that make you think you could not live\r\nwithout a home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly. The fact is I am too socially disposed to be able to live\r\ncontentedly without a friend; and as the only friends I have, or am\r\nlikely to have, are at home, if it\xe2\x80\x94or rather, if they were gone\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\nnot say I could not live\xe2\x80\x94but I would rather not live in such a desolate\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why do you say the only friends you are likely to have? Are you so\r\nunsociable that you cannot make friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I never made one yet; and in my present position there is no\r\npossibility of doing so, or even of forming a common acquaintance. The\r\nfault may be partly in myself, but I hope not altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fault is partly in society, and partly, I should think, in your\r\nimmediate neighbours: and partly, too, in yourself; for many ladies, in\r\nyour position, would make themselves be noticed and accounted of. But\r\nyour pupils should be companions for you in some degree; they cannot be\r\nmany years younger than yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, they are good company sometimes; but I cannot call them\r\nfriends, nor would they think of bestowing such a name on me\xe2\x80\x94they have\r\nother companions better suited to their tastes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are too wise for them. How do you amuse yourself when\r\nalone\xe2\x80\x94do you read much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReading is my favourite occupation, when I have leisure for it and\r\nbooks to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFrom speaking of books in general, he passed to different books in\r\nparticular, and proceeded by rapid transitions from topic to topic,\r\ntill several matters, both of taste and opinion, had been discussed\r\nconsiderably within the space of half an hour, but without the\r\nembellishment of many observations from himself; he being evidently\r\nless bent upon communicating his own thoughts and predilections, than\r\non discovering mine. He had not the tact, or the art, to effect such a\r\npurpose by skilfully drawing out my sentiments or ideas through the\r\nreal or apparent statement of his own, or leading the conversation by\r\nimperceptible gradations to such topics as he wished to advert to: but\r\nsuch gentle abruptness, and such single-minded straightforwardness,\r\ncould not possibly offend me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should he interest himself at all in my moral and intellectual\r\ncapacities: what is it to him what I think or feel?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked myself.\r\nAnd my heart throbbed in answer to the question.\r\n\r\nBut Jane and Susan Green soon reached their home. As they stood\r\nparleying at the park-gates, attempting to persuade Miss Murray to come\r\nin, I wished Mr. Weston would go, that she might not see him with me\r\nwhen she turned round; but, unfortunately, his business, which was to\r\npay one more visit to poor Mark Wood, led him to pursue the same path\r\nas we did, till nearly the close of our journey. When, however, he saw\r\nthat Rosalie had taken leave of her friends and I was about to join\r\nher, he would have left me and passed on at a quicker pace; but, as he\r\ncivilly lifted his hat in passing her, to my surprise, instead of\r\nreturning the salute with a stiff, ungracious bow, she accosted him\r\nwith one of her sweetest smiles, and, walking by his side, began to\r\ntalk to him with all imaginable cheerfulness and affability; and so we\r\nproceeded all three together.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause in the conversation, Mr. Weston made some remark\r\naddressed particularly to me, as referring to something we had been\r\ntalking of before; but before I could answer, Miss Murray replied to\r\nthe observation and enlarged upon it: he rejoined; and, from thence to\r\nthe close of the interview, she engrossed him entirely to herself. It\r\nmight be partly owing to my own stupidity, my want of tact and\r\nassurance: but I felt myself wronged: I trembled with apprehension; and\r\nI listened with envy to her easy, rapid flow of utterance, and saw with\r\nanxiety the bright smile with which she looked into his face from time\r\nto time: for she was walking a little in advance, for the purpose (as I\r\njudged) of being seen as well as heard. If her conversation was light\r\nand trivial, it was amusing, and she was never at a loss for something\r\nto say, or for suitable words to express it in. There was nothing pert\r\nor flippant in her manner now, as when she walked with Mr. Hatfield,\r\nthere was only a gentle, playful kind of vivacity, which I thought must\r\nbe peculiarly pleasing to a man of Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s disposition and\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone she began to laugh, and muttered to herself, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought I could do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo what?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFix that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that he will go home and dream of me. I have shot him through\r\nthe heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy many infallible proofs: more especially the look he gave me when he\r\nwent away. It was not an impudent look\xe2\x80\x94I exonerate him from that\xe2\x80\x94it was\r\na look of reverential, tender adoration. Ha, ha! he\xe2\x80\x99s not quite such a\r\nstupid blockhead as I thought him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made no answer, for my heart was in my throat, or something like it,\r\nand I could not trust myself to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cO God, avert it!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried,\r\ninternally\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor his sake, not for mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Murray made several trivial observations as we passed up the park,\r\nto which (in spite of my reluctance to let one glimpse of my feelings\r\nappear) I could only answer by monosyllables. Whether she intended to\r\ntorment me, or merely to amuse herself, I could not tell\xe2\x80\x94and did not\r\nmuch care; but I thought of the poor man and his one lamb, and the rich\r\nman with his thousand flocks; and I dreaded I knew not what for Mr.\r\nWeston, independently of my own blighted hopes.\r\n\r\nRight glad was I to get into the house, and find myself alone once more\r\nin my own room. My first impulse was to sink into the chair beside the\r\nbed; and laying my head on the pillow, to seek relief in a passionate\r\nburst of tears: there was an imperative craving for such an indulgence;\r\nbut, alas! I must restrain and swallow back my feelings still: there\r\nwas the bell\xe2\x80\x94the odious bell for the schoolroom dinner; and I must go\r\ndown with a calm face, and smile, and laugh, and talk nonsense\xe2\x80\x94yes, and\r\neat, too, if possible, as if all was right, and I was just returned\r\nfrom a pleasant walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nTHE SUBSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nNext Sunday was one of the gloomiest of April days\xe2\x80\x94a day of thick, dark\r\nclouds, and heavy showers. None of the Murrays were disposed to attend\r\nchurch in the afternoon, excepting Rosalie: she was bent upon going as\r\nusual; so she ordered the carriage, and I went with her: nothing loth,\r\nof course, for at church I might look without fear of scorn or censure\r\nupon a form and face more pleasing to me than the most beautiful of\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s creations; I might listen without disturbance to a voice more\r\ncharming than the sweetest music to my ears; I might seem to hold\r\ncommunion with that soul in which I felt so deeply interested, and\r\nimbibe its purest thoughts and holiest aspirations, with no alloy to\r\nsuch felicity except the secret reproaches of my conscience, which\r\nwould too often whisper that I was deceiving my own self, and mocking\r\nGod with the service of a heart more bent upon the creature than the\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nSometimes, such thoughts would give me trouble enough; but sometimes I\r\ncould quiet them with thinking\xe2\x80\x94it is not the man, it is his goodness\r\nthat I love. \xe2\x80\x9cWhatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,\r\nwhatsoever things are honest and of good report, think on these\r\nthings.\xe2\x80\x9d We do well to worship God in His works; and I know none of\r\nthem in which so many of His attributes\xe2\x80\x94so much of His own spirit\r\nshines, as in this His faithful servant; whom to know and not to\r\nappreciate, were obtuse insensibility in me, who have so little else to\r\noccupy my heart.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the conclusion of the service, Miss Murray\r\nleft the church. We had to stand in the porch, for it was raining, and\r\nthe carriage was not yet come. I wondered at her coming forth so\r\nhastily, for neither young Meltham nor Squire Green was there; but I\r\nsoon found it was to secure an interview with Mr. Weston as he came\r\nout, which he presently did. Having saluted us both, he would have\r\npassed on, but she detained him; first with observations upon the\r\ndisagreeable weather, and then with asking if he would be so kind as to\r\ncome some time to-morrow to see the granddaughter of the old woman who\r\nkept the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge, for the girl was ill of a fever, and wished to\r\nsee him. He promised to do so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at what time will you be most likely to come, Mr. Weston? The old\r\nwoman will like to know when to expect you\xe2\x80\x94you know such people think\r\nmore about having their cottages in order when decent people come to\r\nsee them than we are apt to suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere was a wonderful instance of consideration from the thoughtless\r\nMiss Murray. Mr. Weston named an hour in the morning at which he would\r\nendeavour to be there. By this time the carriage was ready, and the\r\nfootman was waiting, with an open umbrella, to escort Miss Murray\r\nthrough the churchyard. I was about to follow; but Mr. Weston had an\r\numbrella too, and offered me the benefit of its shelter, for it was\r\nraining heavily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the rain,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. I always lacked common\r\nsense when taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t _like_ it, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x94an umbrella will do you no harm at\r\nany rate,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with a smile that showed he was not offended; as\r\na man of worse temper or less penetration would have been at such a\r\nrefusal of his aid. I could not deny the truth of his assertion, and so\r\nwent with him to the carriage; he even offered me his hand on getting\r\nin: an unnecessary piece of civility, but I accepted that too, for fear\r\nof giving offence. One glance he gave, one little smile at parting\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas but for a moment; but therein I read, or thought I read, a meaning\r\nthat kindled in my heart a brighter flame of hope than had ever yet\r\narisen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have sent the footman back for you, Miss Grey, if you\xe2\x80\x99d waited\r\na moment\xe2\x80\x94you needn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\nRosalie, with a very unamiable cloud upon her pretty face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would have come without an umbrella, but Mr. Weston offered me the\r\nbenefit of his, and I could not have refused it more than I did without\r\noffending him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, smiling placidly; for my inward happiness\r\nmade that amusing, which would have wounded me at another time.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was now in motion. Miss Murray bent forwards, and looked\r\nout of the window as we were passing Mr. Weston. He was pacing\r\nhomewards along the causeway, and did not turn his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStupid ass!\xe2\x80\x9d cried she, throwing herself back again in the seat. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost by not looking this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has he lost?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA bow from me, that would have raised him to the seventh heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made no answer. I saw she was out of humour, and I derived a secret\r\ngratification from the fact, not that she was vexed, but that she\r\nthought she had reason to be so. It made me think my hopes were not\r\nentirely the offspring of my wishes and imagination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to take up Mr. Weston instead of Mr. Hatfield,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\ncompanion, after a short pause, resuming something of her usual\r\ncheerfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ball at Ashby Park takes place on Tuesday, you know;\r\nand mamma thinks it very likely that Sir Thomas will propose to me\r\nthen: such things are often done in the privacy of the ball-room, when\r\ngentlemen are most easily ensnared, and ladies most enchanting. But if\r\nI am to be married so soon, I must make the best of the present time: I\r\nam determined Hatfield shall not be the only man who shall lay his\r\nheart at my feet, and implore me to accept the worthless gift in vain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean Mr. Weston to be one of your victims,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with\r\naffected indifference, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will have to make such overtures yourself\r\nthat you will find it difficult to draw back when he asks you to fulfil\r\nthe expectations you have raised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose he will ask me to marry him, nor should I desire it:\r\nthat would be rather too much presumption! but I intend him to feel my\r\npower. He has felt it already, indeed: but he shall _acknowledge_ it\r\ntoo; and what visionary hopes he may have, he must keep to himself, and\r\nonly amuse me with the result of them\xe2\x80\x94for a time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that some kind spirit would whisper those words in his ear,\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\ninwardly exclaimed. I was far too indignant to hazard a reply to her\r\nobservation aloud; and nothing more was said about Mr. Weston that day,\r\nby me or in my hearing. But next morning, soon after breakfast, Miss\r\nMurray came into the schoolroom, where her sister was employed at her\r\nstudies, or rather her lessons, for studies they were not, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatilda, I want you to take a walk with me about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t, Rosalie! I have to give orders about my new bridle and\r\nsaddle-cloth, and speak to the rat-catcher about his dogs: Miss Grey\r\nmust go with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosalie; and calling her sister to the window,\r\nshe whispered an explanation in her ear; upon which the latter\r\nconsented to go.\r\n\r\nI remembered that eleven was the hour at which Mr. Weston proposed to\r\ncome to the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge; and remembering that, I beheld the whole\r\ncontrivance. Accordingly, at dinner, I was entertained with a long\r\naccount of how Mr. Weston had overtaken them as they were walking along\r\nthe road; and how they had had a long walk and talk with him, and\r\nreally found him quite an agreeable companion; and how he must have\r\nbeen, and evidently was, delighted with them and their amazing\r\ncondescension, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nCONFESSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I am in the way of confessions I may as well acknowledge that, about\r\nthis time, I paid more attention to dress than ever I had done before.\r\nThis is not saying much\xe2\x80\x94for hitherto I had been a little neglectful in\r\nthat particular; but now, also, it was no uncommon thing to spend as\r\nmuch as two minutes in the contemplation of my own image in the glass;\r\nthough I never could derive any consolation from such a study. I could\r\ndiscover no beauty in those marked features, that pale hollow cheek,\r\nand ordinary dark brown hair; there might be intellect in the forehead,\r\nthere might be expression in the dark grey eyes, but what of that?\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nlow Grecian brow, and large black eyes devoid of sentiment would be\r\nesteemed far preferable. It is foolish to wish for beauty. Sensible\r\npeople never either desire it for themselves or care about it in\r\nothers. If the mind be but well cultivated, and the heart well\r\ndisposed, no one ever cares for the exterior. So said the teachers of\r\nour childhood; and so say we to the children of the present day. All\r\nvery judicious and proper, no doubt; but are such assertions supported\r\nby actual experience?\r\n\r\nWe are naturally disposed to love what gives us pleasure, and what more\r\npleasing than a beautiful face\xe2\x80\x94when we know no harm of the possessor at\r\nleast? A little girl loves her bird\xe2\x80\x94Why? Because it lives and feels;\r\nbecause it is helpless and harmless? A toad, likewise, lives and feels,\r\nand is equally helpless and harmless; but though she would not hurt a\r\ntoad, she cannot love it like the bird, with its graceful form, soft\r\nfeathers, and bright, speaking eyes. If a woman is fair and amiable,\r\nshe is praised for both qualities, but especially the former, by the\r\nbulk of mankind: if, on the other hand, she is disagreeable in person\r\nand character, her plainness is commonly inveighed against as her\r\ngreatest crime, because, to common observers, it gives the greatest\r\noffence; while, if she is plain and good, provided she is a person of\r\nretired manners and secluded life, no one ever knows of her goodness,\r\nexcept her immediate connections. Others, on the contrary, are disposed\r\nto form unfavourable opinions of her mind, and disposition, if it be\r\nbut to excuse themselves for their instinctive dislike of one so\r\nunfavoured by nature; and _vice vers\xc3\xa2_ with her whose angel form\r\nconceals a vicious heart, or sheds a false, deceitful charm over\r\ndefects and foibles that would not be tolerated in another. They that\r\nhave beauty, let them be thankful for it, and make a good use of it,\r\nlike any other talent; they that have it not, let them console\r\nthemselves, and do the best they can without it: certainly, though\r\nliable to be over-estimated, it is a gift of God, and not to be\r\ndespised. Many will feel this who have felt that they could love, and\r\nwhose hearts tell them that they are worthy to be loved again; while\r\nyet they are debarred, by the lack of this or some such seeming trifle,\r\nfrom giving and receiving that happiness they seem almost made to feel\r\nand to impart. As well might the humble glowworm despise that power of\r\ngiving light without which the roving fly might pass her and repass her\r\na thousand times, and never rest beside her: she might hear her winged\r\ndarling buzzing over and around her; he vainly seeking her, she longing\r\nto be found, but with no power to make her presence known, no voice to\r\ncall him, no wings to follow his flight;\xe2\x80\x94the fly must seek another\r\nmate, the worm must live and die alone.\r\n\r\nSuch were some of my reflections about this period. I might go on\r\nprosing more and more, I might dive much deeper, and disclose other\r\nthoughts, propose questions the reader might be puzzled to answer, and\r\ndeduce arguments that might startle his prejudices, or, perhaps,\r\nprovoke his ridicule, because he could not comprehend them; but I\r\nforbear.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, let us return to Miss Murray. She accompanied her mamma\r\nto the ball on Tuesday; of course splendidly attired, and delighted\r\nwith her prospects and her charms. As Ashby Park was nearly ten miles\r\ndistant from Horton Lodge, they had to set out pretty early, and I\r\nintended to have spent the evening with Nancy Brown, whom I had not\r\nseen for a long time; but my kind pupil took care I should spend it\r\nneither there nor anywhere else beyond the limits of the schoolroom, by\r\ngiving me a piece of music to copy, which kept me closely occupied till\r\nbed-time. About eleven next morning, as soon as she had left her room,\r\nshe came to tell me her news. Sir Thomas had indeed proposed to her at\r\nthe ball; an event which reflected great credit on her mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsagacity, if not upon her skill in contrivance. I rather incline to the\r\nbelief that she had first laid her plans, and then predicted their\r\nsuccess. The offer had been accepted, of course, and the bridegroom\r\nelect was coming that day to settle matters with Mr. Murray.\r\n\r\nRosalie was pleased with the thoughts of becoming mistress of Ashby\r\nPark; she was elated with the prospect of the bridal ceremony and its\r\nattendant splendour and \xc3\xa9clat, the honeymoon spent abroad, and the\r\nsubsequent gaieties she expected to enjoy in London and elsewhere; she\r\nappeared pretty well pleased too, for the time being, with Sir Thomas\r\nhimself, because she had so lately seen him, danced with him, and been\r\nflattered by him; but, after all, she seemed to shrink from the idea of\r\nbeing so soon united: she wished the ceremony to be delayed some\r\nmonths, at least; and I wished it too. It seemed a horrible thing to\r\nhurry on the inauspicious match, and not to give the poor creature time\r\nto think and reason on the irrevocable step she was about to take. I\r\nmade no pretension to \xe2\x80\x9ca mother\xe2\x80\x99s watchful, anxious care,\xe2\x80\x9d but I was\r\namazed and horrified at Mrs. Murray\xe2\x80\x99s heartlessness, or want of thought\r\nfor the real good of her child; and by my unheeded warnings and\r\nexhortations, I vainly strove to remedy the evil. Miss Murray only\r\nlaughed at what I said; and I soon found that her reluctance to an\r\nimmediate union arose chiefly from a desire to do what execution she\r\ncould among the young gentlemen of her acquaintance, before she was\r\nincapacitated from further mischief of the kind. It was for this cause\r\nthat, before confiding to me the secret of her engagement, she had\r\nextracted a promise that I would not mention a word on the subject to\r\nany one. And when I saw this, and when I beheld her plunge more\r\nrecklessly than ever into the depths of heartless coquetry, I had no\r\nmore pity for her. \xe2\x80\x9cCome what will,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, \xe2\x80\x9cshe deserves it. Sir\r\nThomas cannot be too bad for her; and the sooner she is incapacitated\r\nfrom deceiving and injuring others the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wedding was fixed for the first of June. Between that and the\r\ncritical ball was little more than six weeks; but, with Rosalie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccomplished skill and resolute exertion, much might be done, even\r\nwithin that period; especially as Sir Thomas spent most of the interim\r\nin London; whither he went up, it was said, to settle affairs with his\r\nlawyer, and make other preparations for the approaching nuptials. He\r\nendeavoured to supply the want of his presence by a pretty constant\r\nfire of billets-doux; but these did not attract the neighbours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nattention, and open their eyes, as personal visits would have done; and\r\nold Lady Ashby\xe2\x80\x99s haughty, sour spirit of reserve withheld her from\r\nspreading the news, while her indifferent health prevented her coming\r\nto visit her future daughter-in-law; so that, altogether, this affair\r\nwas kept far closer than such things usually are.\r\n\r\nRosalie would sometimes show her lover\xe2\x80\x99s epistles to me, to convince me\r\nwhat a kind, devoted husband he would make. She showed me the letters\r\nof another individual, too, the unfortunate Mr. Green, who had not the\r\ncourage, or, as she expressed it, the \xe2\x80\x9cspunk,\xe2\x80\x9d to plead his cause in\r\nperson, but whom one denial would not satisfy: he must write again and\r\nagain. He would not have done so if he could have seen the grimaces his\r\nfair idol made over his moving appeals to her feelings, and heard her\r\nscornful laughter, and the opprobrious epithets she heaped upon him for\r\nhis perseverance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell him, at once, that you are engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to know that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he knew it, his\r\nsisters and everybody would know it, and then there would be an end of\r\nmy\xe2\x80\x94ahem! And, besides, if I told him that, he would think my engagement\r\nwas the only obstacle, and that I would have him if I were free; which\r\nI could not bear that any man should think, and he, of all others, at\r\nleast. Besides, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for his letters,\xe2\x80\x9d she added,\r\ncontemptuously; \xe2\x80\x9che may write as often as he pleases, and look as great\r\na calf as he likes when I meet him; it only amuses me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeantime, young Meltham was pretty frequent in his visits to the house\r\nor transits past it; and, judging by Matilda\xe2\x80\x99s execrations and\r\nreproaches, her sister paid more attention to him than civility\r\nrequired; in other words, she carried on as animated a flirtation as\r\nthe presence of her parents would admit. She made some attempts to\r\nbring Mr. Hatfield once more to her feet; but finding them\r\nunsuccessful, she repaid his haughty indifference with still loftier\r\nscorn, and spoke of him with as much disdain and detestation as she had\r\nformerly done of his curate. But, amid all this, she never for a moment\r\nlost sight of Mr. Weston. She embraced every opportunity of meeting\r\nhim, tried every art to fascinate him, and pursued him with as much\r\nperseverance as if she really loved him and no other, and the happiness\r\nof her life depended upon eliciting a return of affection. Such conduct\r\nwas completely beyond my comprehension. Had I seen it depicted in a\r\nnovel, I should have thought it unnatural; had I heard it described by\r\nothers, I should have deemed it a mistake or an exaggeration; but when\r\nI saw it with my own eyes, and suffered from it too, I could only\r\nconclude that excessive vanity, like drunkenness, hardens the heart,\r\nenslaves the faculties, and perverts the feelings; and that dogs are\r\nnot the only creatures which, when gorged to the throat, will yet gloat\r\nover what they cannot devour, and grudge the smallest morsel to a\r\nstarving brother.\r\n\r\nShe now became extremely beneficent to the poor cottagers. Her\r\nacquaintance among them was more widely extended, her visits to their\r\nhumble dwellings were more frequent and excursive than they had ever\r\nbeen before. Hereby, she earned among them the reputation of a\r\ncondescending and very charitable young lady; and their encomiums were\r\nsure to be repeated to Mr. Weston: whom also she had thus a daily\r\nchance of meeting in one or other of their abodes, or in her transits\r\nto and fro; and often, likewise, she could gather, through their\r\ngossip, to what places he was likely to go at such and such a time,\r\nwhether to baptize a child, or to visit the aged, the sick, the sad, or\r\nthe dying; and most skilfully she laid her plans accordingly. In these\r\nexcursions she would sometimes go with her sister\xe2\x80\x94whom, by some means,\r\nshe had persuaded or bribed to enter into her schemes\xe2\x80\x94sometimes alone,\r\nnever, now, with me; so that I was debarred the pleasure of seeing Mr.\r\nWeston, or hearing his voice even in conversation with another: which\r\nwould certainly have been a very great pleasure, however hurtful or\r\nhowever fraught with pain. I could not even see him at church: for Miss\r\nMurray, under some trivial pretext, chose to take possession of that\r\ncorner in the family pew which had been mine ever since I came; and,\r\nunless I had the presumption to station myself between Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMurray, I must sit with my back to the pulpit, which I accordingly did.\r\n\r\nNow, also, I never walked home with my pupils: they said their mamma\r\nthought it did not look well to see three people out of the family\r\nwalking, and only two going in the carriage; and, as they greatly\r\npreferred walking in fine weather, I should be honoured by going with\r\nthe seniors. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides,\xe2\x80\x9d said they, \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t walk as fast as we\r\ndo; you know you\xe2\x80\x99re always lagging behind.\xe2\x80\x9d I knew these were false\r\nexcuses, but I made no objections, and never contradicted such\r\nassertions, well knowing the motives which dictated them. And in the\r\nafternoons, during those six memorable weeks, I never went to church at\r\nall. If I had a cold, or any slight indisposition, they took advantage\r\nof that to make me stay at home; and often they would tell me they were\r\nnot going again that day, themselves, and then pretend to change their\r\nminds, and set off without telling me: so managing their departure that\r\nI never discovered the change of purpose till too late. Upon their\r\nreturn home, on one of these occasions, they entertained me with an\r\nanimated account of a conversation they had had with Mr. Weston as they\r\ncame along. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he asked if you were ill, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matilda;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut we told him you were quite well, only you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come to\r\nchurch\xe2\x80\x94so he\xe2\x80\x99ll think you\xe2\x80\x99re turned wicked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll chance meetings on week-days were likewise carefully prevented;\r\nfor, lest I should go to see poor Nancy Brown or any other person, Miss\r\nMurray took good care to provide sufficient employment for all my\r\nleisure hours. There was always some drawing to finish, some music to\r\ncopy, or some work to do, sufficient to incapacitate me from indulging\r\nin anything beyond a short walk about the grounds, however she or her\r\nsister might be occupied.\r\n\r\nOne morning, having sought and waylaid Mr. Weston, they returned in\r\nhigh glee to give me an account of their interview. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he asked after\r\nyou again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matilda, in spite of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s silent but\r\nimperative intimation that she should hold her tongue. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wondered why\r\nyou were never with us, and thought you must have delicate health, as\r\nyou came out so seldom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t Matilda\xe2\x80\x94what nonsense you\xe2\x80\x99re talking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Rosalie, what a lie! He did, you know; and you said\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nRosalie\xe2\x80\x94hang it!\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t be pinched so! And, Miss Grey, Rosalie told\r\nhim you were quite well, but you were always so buried in your books\r\nthat you had no pleasure in anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea he must have of me!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes old Nancy ever inquire about me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and we tell her you are so fond of reading and drawing that you\r\ncan do nothing else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the case though; if you had told her I was so busy I could\r\nnot come to see her, it would have been nearer the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Murray, suddenly kindling up;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have plenty of time to yourself now, when you have so\r\nlittle teaching to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no use beginning to dispute with such indulged, unreasoning\r\ncreatures: so I held my peace. I was accustomed, now, to keeping\r\nsilence when things distasteful to my ear were uttered; and now, too, I\r\nwas used to wearing a placid smiling countenance when my heart was\r\nbitter within me. Only those who have felt the like can imagine my\r\nfeelings, as I sat with an assumption of smiling indifference,\r\nlistening to the accounts of those meetings and interviews with Mr.\r\nWeston, which they seemed to find such pleasure in describing to me;\r\nand hearing things asserted of him which, from the character of the\r\nman, I knew to be exaggerations and perversions of the truth, if not\r\nentirely false\xe2\x80\x94things derogatory to him, and flattering to\r\nthem\xe2\x80\x94especially to Miss Murray\xe2\x80\x94which I burned to contradict, or, at\r\nleast, to show my doubts about, but dared not; lest, in expressing my\r\ndisbelief, I should display my interest too. Other things I heard,\r\nwhich I felt or feared were indeed too true: but I must still conceal\r\nmy anxiety respecting him, my indignation against them, beneath a\r\ncareless aspect; others, again, mere hints of something said or done,\r\nwhich I longed to hear more of, but could not venture to inquire. So\r\npassed the weary time. I could not even comfort myself with saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will soon be married; and then there may be hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSoon after her marriage the holidays would come; and when I returned\r\nfrom home, most likely, Mr. Weston would be gone, for I was told that\r\nhe and the Rector could not agree (the Rector\xe2\x80\x99s fault, of course), and\r\nhe was about to remove to another place.\r\n\r\nNo\xe2\x80\x94besides my hope in God, my only consolation was in thinking that,\r\nthough he know it not, I was more worthy of his love than Rosalie\r\nMurray, charming and engaging as she was; for I could appreciate his\r\nexcellence, which she could not: I would devote my life to the\r\npromotion of his happiness; she would destroy his happiness for the\r\nmomentary gratification of her own vanity. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if he could but know\r\nthe difference!\xe2\x80\x9d I would earnestly exclaim. \xe2\x80\x9cBut no! I would not have\r\nhim see my heart: yet, if he could but know her hollowness, her\r\nworthless, heartless frivolity, he would then be safe, and I should\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94_almost_ happy, though I might never see him more!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI fear, by this time, the reader is well nigh disgusted with the folly\r\nand weakness I have so freely laid before him. I never disclosed it\r\nthen, and would not have done so had my own sister or my mother been\r\nwith me in the house. I was a close and resolute dissembler\xe2\x80\x94in this one\r\ncase at least. My prayers, my tears, my wishes, fears, and\r\nlamentations, were witnessed by myself and heaven alone.\r\n\r\nWhen we are harassed by sorrows or anxieties, or long oppressed by any\r\npowerful feelings which we must keep to ourselves, for which we can\r\nobtain and seek no sympathy from any living creature, and which yet we\r\ncannot, or will not wholly crush, we often naturally seek relief in\r\npoetry\xe2\x80\x94and often find it, too\xe2\x80\x94whether in the effusions of others, which\r\nseem to harmonize with our existing case, or in our own attempts to\r\ngive utterance to those thoughts and feelings in strains less musical,\r\nperchance, but more appropriate, and therefore more penetrating and\r\nsympathetic, and, for the time, more soothing, or more powerful to\r\nrouse and to unburden the oppressed and swollen heart. Before this\r\ntime, at Wellwood House and here, when suffering from home-sick\r\nmelancholy, I had sought relief twice or thrice at this secret source\r\nof consolation; and now I flew to it again, with greater avidity than\r\never, because I seemed to need it more. I still preserve those relics\r\nof past sufferings and experience, like pillars of witness set up in\r\ntravelling through the vale of life, to mark particular occurrences.\r\nThe footsteps are obliterated now; the face of the country may be\r\nchanged; but the pillar is still there, to remind me how all things\r\nwere when it was reared. Lest the reader should be curious to see any\r\nof these effusions, I will favour him with one short specimen: cold and\r\nlanguid as the lines may seem, it was almost a passion of grief to\r\nwhich they owed their being:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nOh, they have robbed me of the hope\r\n    My spirit held so dear;\r\nThey will not let me hear that voice\r\n    My soul delights to hear.\r\n\r\nThey will not let me see that face\r\n    I so delight to see;\r\nAnd they have taken all thy smiles,\r\n    And all thy love from me.\r\n\r\nWell, let them seize on all they can;\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    One treasure still is mine,\xe2\x80\x94\r\nA heart that loves to think on thee,\r\n    And feels the worth of thine.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, at least, they could not deprive me of that: I could think of him\r\nday and night; and I could feel that he was worthy to be thought of.\r\nNobody knew him as I did; nobody could appreciate him as I did; nobody\r\ncould love him as I\xe2\x80\x94could, if I might: but there was the evil. What\r\nbusiness had I to think so much of one that never thought of me? Was it\r\nnot foolish? was it not wrong? Yet, if I found such deep delight in\r\nthinking of him, and if I kept those thoughts to myself, and troubled\r\nno one else with them, where was the harm of it? I would ask myself.\r\nAnd such reasoning prevented me from making any sufficient effort to\r\nshake off my fetters.\r\n\r\nBut, if those thoughts brought delight, it was a painful, troubled\r\npleasure, too near akin to anguish; and one that did me more injury\r\nthan I was aware of. It was an indulgence that a person of more wisdom\r\nor more experience would doubtless have denied herself. And yet, how\r\ndreary to turn my eyes from the contemplation of that bright object and\r\nforce them to dwell on the dull, grey, desolate prospect around: the\r\njoyless, hopeless, solitary path that lay before me. It was wrong to be\r\nso joyless, so desponding; I should have made God my friend, and to do\r\nHis will the pleasure and the business of my life; but faith was weak,\r\nand passion was too strong.\r\n\r\nIn this time of trouble I had two other causes of affliction. The first\r\nmay seem a trifle, but it cost me many a tear: Snap, my little dumb,\r\nrough-visaged, but bright-eyed, warm-hearted companion, the only thing\r\nI had to love me, was taken away, and delivered over to the tender\r\nmercies of the village rat-catcher, a man notorious for his brutal\r\ntreatment of his canine slaves. The other was serious enough; my\r\nletters from home gave intimation that my father\xe2\x80\x99s health was worse. No\r\nboding fears were expressed, but I was grown timid and despondent, and\r\ncould not help fearing that some dreadful calamity awaited us there. I\r\nseemed to see the black clouds gathering round my native hills, and to\r\nhear the angry muttering of a storm that was about to burst, and\r\ndesolate our hearth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nMIRTH AND MOURNING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 1st of June arrived at last: and Rosalie Murray was transmuted into\r\nLady Ashby. Most splendidly beautiful she looked in her bridal costume.\r\nUpon her return from church, after the ceremony, she came flying into\r\nthe schoolroom, flushed with excitement, and laughing, half in mirth,\r\nand half in reckless desperation, as it seemed to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Miss Grey, I\xe2\x80\x99m Lady Ashby!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s done, my fate is\r\nsealed: there\xe2\x80\x99s no drawing back now. I\xe2\x80\x99m come to receive your\r\ncongratulations and bid you good-by; and then I\xe2\x80\x99m off for Paris, Rome,\r\nNaples, Switzerland, London\xe2\x80\x94oh, dear! what a deal I shall see and hear\r\nbefore I come back again. But don\xe2\x80\x99t forget me: I shan\xe2\x80\x99t forget you,\r\nthough I\xe2\x80\x99ve been a naughty girl. Come, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you congratulate me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot congratulate you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9ctill I know whether this\r\nchange is really for the better: but I sincerely hope it is; and I wish\r\nyou true happiness and the best of blessings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good-by, the carriage is waiting, and they\xe2\x80\x99re calling me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave me a hasty kiss, and was hurrying away; but, suddenly\r\nreturning, embraced me with more affection than I thought her capable\r\nof evincing, and departed with tears in her eyes. Poor girl! I really\r\nloved her then; and forgave her from my heart all the injury she had\r\ndone me\xe2\x80\x94and others also: she had not half known it, I was sure; and I\r\nprayed God to pardon her too.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of that day of festal sadness, I was left to my\r\nown devices. Being too much unhinged for any steady occupation, I\r\nwandered about with a book in my hand for several hours, more thinking\r\nthan reading, for I had many things to think about. In the evening, I\r\nmade use of my liberty to go and see my old friend Nancy once again; to\r\napologize for my long absence (which must have seemed so neglectful and\r\nunkind) by telling her how busy I had been; and to talk, or read, or\r\nwork for her, whichever might be most acceptable, and also, of course,\r\nto tell her the news of this important day: and perhaps to obtain a\r\nlittle information from her in return, respecting Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x99s expected\r\ndeparture. But of this she seemed to know nothing, and I hoped, as she\r\ndid, that it was all a false report. She was very glad to see me; but,\r\nhappily, her eyes were now so nearly well that she was almost\r\nindependent of my services. She was deeply interested in the wedding;\r\nbut while I amused her with the details of the festive day, the\r\nsplendours of the bridal party and of the bride herself, she often\r\nsighed and shook her head, and wished good might come of it; she\r\nseemed, like me, to regard it rather as a theme for sorrow than\r\nrejoicing. I sat a long time talking to her about that and other\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94but no one came.\r\n\r\nShall I confess that I sometimes looked towards the door with a\r\nhalf-expectant wish to see it open and give entrance to Mr. Weston, as\r\nhad happened once before? and that, returning through the lanes and\r\nfields, I often paused to look round me, and walked more slowly than\r\nwas at all necessary\xe2\x80\x94for, though a fine evening, it was not a hot\r\none\xe2\x80\x94and, finally, felt a sense of emptiness and disappointment at\r\nhaving reached the house without meeting or even catching a distant\r\nglimpse of any one, except a few labourers returning from their work?\r\n\r\nSunday, however, was approaching: I should see him then: for now that\r\nMiss Murray was gone, I could have my old corner again. I should see\r\nhim, and by look, speech, and manner, I might judge whether the\r\ncircumstance of her marriage had very much afflicted him. Happily I\r\ncould perceive no shadow of a difference: he wore the same aspect as he\r\nhad worn two months ago\xe2\x80\x94voice, look, manner, all alike unchanged: there\r\nwas the same keen-sighted, unclouded truthfulness in his discourse, the\r\nsame forcible clearness in his style, the same earnest simplicity in\r\nall he said and did, that made itself, not marked by the eye and ear,\r\nbut felt upon the hearts of his audience.\r\n\r\nI walked home with Miss Matilda; but _he did not join us_. Matilda was\r\nnow sadly at a loss for amusement, and wofully in want of a companion:\r\nher brothers at school, her sister married and gone, she too young to\r\nbe admitted into society; for which, from Rosalie\xe2\x80\x99s example, she was in\r\nsome degree beginning to acquire a taste\xe2\x80\x94a taste at least for the\r\ncompany of certain classes of gentlemen; at this dull time of year\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nhunting going on, no shooting even\xe2\x80\x94for, though she might not join in\r\nthat, it was _something_ to see her father or the gamekeeper go out\r\nwith the dogs, and to talk with them on their return, about the\r\ndifferent birds they had bagged. Now, also, she was denied the solace\r\nwhich the companionship of the coachman, grooms, horses, greyhounds,\r\nand pointers might have afforded; for her mother having,\r\nnotwithstanding the disadvantages of a country life, so satisfactorily\r\ndisposed of her elder daughter, the pride of her heart had begun\r\nseriously to turn her attention to the younger; and, being truly\r\nalarmed at the roughness of her manners, and thinking it high time to\r\nwork a reform, had been roused at length to exert her authority, and\r\nprohibited entirely the yards, stables, kennels, and coach-house. Of\r\ncourse, she was not implicitly obeyed; but, indulgent as she had\r\nhitherto been, when once her spirit was roused, her temper was not so\r\ngentle as she required that of her governesses to be, and her will was\r\nnot to be thwarted with impunity. After many a scene of contention\r\nbetween mother and daughter, many a violent outbreak which I was\r\nashamed to witness, in which the father\xe2\x80\x99s authority was often called in\r\nto confirm with oaths and threats the mother\xe2\x80\x99s slighted\r\nprohibitions\xe2\x80\x94for even _he_ could see that \xe2\x80\x9cTilly, though she would have\r\nmade a fine lad, was not quite what a young lady ought to be\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Matilda\r\nat length found that her easiest plan was to keep clear of the\r\nforbidden regions; unless she could now and then steal a visit without\r\nher watchful mother\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge.\r\n\r\nAmid all this, let it not be imagined that I escaped without many a\r\nreprimand, and many an implied reproach, that lost none of its sting\r\nfrom not being openly worded; but rather wounded the more deeply,\r\nbecause, from that very reason, it seemed to preclude self-defence.\r\nFrequently, I was told to amuse Miss Matilda with other things, and to\r\nremind her of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s precepts and prohibitions. I did so to the\r\nbest of my power: but she would not be amused against her will, and\r\ncould not against her taste; and though I went beyond mere reminding,\r\nsuch gentle remonstrances as I could use were utterly ineffectual.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Dear_ Miss Grey! it is the _strangest_ thing. I suppose you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp it, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not in your nature\xe2\x80\x94but I _wonder_ you can\xe2\x80\x99t win the\r\nconfidence of that girl, and make your society at _least_ as agreeable\r\nto her as that of Robert or Joseph!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can talk the best about the things in which she is most\r\ninterested,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! that is a strange confession, _however_, to come from her\r\n_governess_! Who is to form a young lady\xe2\x80\x99s tastes, I wonder, if the\r\ngoverness doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do it? I have known governesses who have so\r\ncompletely identified themselves with the reputation of their young\r\nladies for elegance and propriety in mind and manners, that they would\r\nblush to speak a word against them; and to hear the slightest blame\r\nimputed to their pupils was worse than to be censured in their own\r\npersons\xe2\x80\x94and I really think it very natural, for my part.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course: the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s proficiency and elegance is of more\r\nconsequence to the governess than her own, as well as to the world. If\r\nshe wishes to prosper in her vocation she must devote all her energies\r\nto her business: all her ideas and all her ambition will tend to the\r\naccomplishment of that one object. When we wish to decide upon the\r\nmerits of a governess, we naturally look at the young ladies she\r\nprofesses to have educated, and judge accordingly. The _judicious_\r\ngoverness knows this: she knows that, while she lives in obscurity\r\nherself, her pupils\xe2\x80\x99 virtues and defects will be open to every eye; and\r\nthat, unless she loses sight of herself in their cultivation, she need\r\nnot hope for success. You see, Miss Grey, it is just the same as any\r\nother trade or profession: they that wish to prosper must devote\r\nthemselves body and soul to their calling; and if they begin to yield\r\nto indolence or self-indulgence they are speedily distanced by wiser\r\ncompetitors: there is little to choose between a person that ruins her\r\npupils by neglect, and one that corrupts them by her example. You will\r\nexcuse my dropping these little hints: you know it is all for your own\r\ngood. Many ladies would speak to you much more strongly; and many would\r\nnot trouble themselves to speak at all, but quietly look out for a\r\nsubstitute. That, of course, would be the _easiest_ plan: but I know\r\nthe advantages of a place like this to a person in your situation; and\r\nI have no desire to part with you, as I am sure you would do very well\r\nif you will only think of these things and try to exert yourself a\r\n_little_ more: then, I am convinced, you would _soon_ acquire that\r\ndelicate tact which alone is wanting to give you a proper influence\r\nover the mind of your pupil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to give the lady some idea of the fallacy of her\r\nexpectations; but she sailed away as soon as she had concluded her\r\nspeech. Having said what she wished, it was no part of her plan to\r\nawait my answer: it was my business to hear, and not to speak.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I have said, Matilda at length yielded in some degree to\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s authority (pity it had not been exerted before); and being\r\nthus deprived of almost every source of amusement, there was nothing\r\nfor it but to take long rides with the groom and long walks with the\r\ngoverness, and to visit the cottages and farmhouses on her father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nestate, to kill time in chatting with the old men and women that\r\ninhabited them. In one of these walks, it was our chance to meet Mr.\r\nWeston. This was what I had long desired; but now, for a moment, I\r\nwished either he or I were away: I felt my heart throb so violently\r\nthat I dreaded lest some outward signs of emotion should appear; but I\r\nthink he hardly glanced at me, and I was soon calm enough. After a\r\nbrief salutation to both, he asked Matilda if she had lately heard from\r\nher sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was at Paris when she wrote, and very well,\r\nand very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe spoke the last word emphatically, and with a glance impertinently\r\nsly. He did not seem to notice it, but replied, with equal emphasis,\r\nand very seriously\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she will continue to be so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it likely?\xe2\x80\x9d I ventured to inquire: for Matilda had\r\nstarted off in pursuit of her dog, that was chasing a leveret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas may be a better man than I\r\nsuppose; but, from all I have heard and seen, it seems a pity that one\r\nso young and gay, and\xe2\x80\x94and interesting, to express many things by one\r\nword\xe2\x80\x94whose greatest, if not her only fault, appears to be\r\nthoughtlessness\xe2\x80\x94no trifling fault to be sure, since it renders the\r\npossessor liable to almost every other, and exposes him to so many\r\ntemptations\xe2\x80\x94but it seems a pity that she should be thrown away on such\r\na man. It was her mother\xe2\x80\x99s wish, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and her own too, I think, for she always laughed at my attempts\r\nto dissuade her from the step.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did attempt it? Then, at least, you will have the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that it is no fault of yours, if any harm should come of it. As\r\nfor Mrs. Murray, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how she can justify her conduct: if I had\r\nsufficient acquaintance with her, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems unnatural: but some people think rank and wealth the chief\r\ngood; and, if they can secure that for their children, they think they\r\nhave done their duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue: but is it not strange that persons of experience, who have been\r\nmarried themselves, should judge so falsely?\xe2\x80\x9d Matilda now came panting\r\nback, with the lacerated body of the young hare in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it your intention to kill that hare, or to save it, Miss Murray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Mr. Weston, apparently puzzled at her gleeful countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pretended to want to save it,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, honestly enough, \xe2\x80\x9cas it\r\nwas so glaringly out of season; but I was better pleased to see it\r\nlolled. However, you can both witness that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it: Prince\r\nwas determined to have her; and he clutched her by the back, and killed\r\nher in a minute! Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it a noble chase?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery! for a young lady after a leveret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a quiet sarcasm in the tone of his reply which was not lost\r\nupon her; she shrugged her shoulders, and, turning away with a\r\nsignificant \xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d asked me how I had enjoyed the fun. I replied that\r\nI saw no fun in the matter; but admitted that I had not observed the\r\ntransaction very narrowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you see how it doubled\xe2\x80\x94just like an old hare? and didn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nhear it scream?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say I did not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cried out just like a child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor little thing! What will you do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along\xe2\x80\x94I shall leave it in the first house we come to. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to take it home, for fear papa should scold me for letting the dog\r\nkill it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Weston was now gone, and we too went on our way; but as we\r\nreturned, after having deposited the hare in a farm-house, and\r\ndemolished some spice-cake and currant-wine in exchange, we met him\r\nreturning also from the execution of his mission, whatever it might be.\r\nHe carried in his hand a cluster of beautiful bluebells, which he\r\noffered to me; observing, with a smile, that though he had seen so\r\nlittle of me for the last two months, he had not forgotten that\r\nbluebells were numbered among my favourite flowers. It was done as a\r\nsimple act of goodwill, without compliment or remarkable courtesy, or\r\nany look that could be construed into \xe2\x80\x9creverential, tender adoration\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(_vide_ Rosalie Murray); but still, it was something to find my\r\nunimportant saying so well remembered: it was something that he had\r\nnoticed so accurately the time I had ceased to be visible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was told,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were a perfect bookworm, Miss Grey: so\r\ncompletely absorbed in your studies that you were lost to every other\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite true!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Matilda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Weston: don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it: it\xe2\x80\x99s a scandalous libel. These young\r\nladies are too fond of making random assertions at the expense of their\r\nfriends; and you ought to be careful how you listen to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope _this_ assertion is groundless, at any rate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Do you particularly object to ladies studying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but I object to anyone so devoting himself or herself to study, as\r\nto lose sight of everything else. Except under peculiar circumstances,\r\nI consider very close and constant study as a waste of time, and an\r\ninjury to the mind as well as the body.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have neither the time nor the inclination for such\r\ntransgressions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe parted again.\r\n\r\nWell! what is there remarkable in all this? Why have I recorded it?\r\nBecause, reader, it was important enough to give me a cheerful evening,\r\na night of pleasing dreams, and a morning of felicitous hopes.\r\nShallow-brained cheerfulness, foolish dreams, unfounded hopes, you\r\nwould say; and I will not venture to deny it: suspicions to that effect\r\narose too frequently in my own mind. But our wishes are like tinder:\r\nthe flint and steel of circumstances are continually striking out\r\nsparks, which vanish immediately, unless they chance to fall upon the\r\ntinder of our wishes; then, they instantly ignite, and the flame of\r\nhope is kindled in a moment.\r\n\r\nBut alas! that very morning, my flickering flame of hope was dismally\r\nquenched by a letter from my mother, which spoke so seriously of my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s increasing illness, that I feared there was little or no\r\nchance of his recovery; and, close at hand as the holidays were, I\r\nalmost trembled lest they should come too late for me to meet him in\r\nthis world. Two days after, a letter from Mary told me his life was\r\ndespaired of, and his end seemed fast approaching. Then, immediately, I\r\nsought permission to anticipate the vacation, and go without delay.\r\nMrs. Murray stared, and wondered at the unwonted energy and boldness\r\nwith which I urged the request, and thought there was no occasion to\r\nhurry; but finally gave me leave: stating, however, that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\nneed to be in such agitation about the matter\xe2\x80\x94it might prove a false\r\nalarm after all; and if not\xe2\x80\x94why, it was only in the common course of\r\nnature: we must all die some time; and I was not to suppose myself the\r\nonly afflicted person in the world;\xe2\x80\x9d and concluding with saying I might\r\nhave the phaeton to take me to O\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd instead of _repining_, Miss\r\nGrey, be thankful for the _privileges_ you enjoy. There\xe2\x80\x99s many a poor\r\nclergyman whose family would be plunged into ruin by the event of his\r\ndeath; but you, you see, have influential friends ready to continue\r\ntheir patronage, and to show you every consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked her for her \xe2\x80\x9cconsideration,\xe2\x80\x9d and flew to my room to make some\r\nhurried preparations for my departure. My bonnet and shawl being on,\r\nand a few things hastily crammed into my largest trunk, I descended.\r\nBut I might have done the work more leisurely, for no one else was in a\r\nhurry; and I had still a considerable time to wait for the phaeton. At\r\nlength it came to the door, and I was off: but, oh, what a dreary\r\njourney was that! how utterly different from my former passages\r\nhomewards! Being too late for the last coach to \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, I had to hire a cab\r\nfor ten miles, and then a car to take me over the rugged hills.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past ten before I reached home. They were not in bed.\r\n\r\nMy mother and sister both met me in the passage\xe2\x80\x94sad\xe2\x80\x94silent\xe2\x80\x94pale! I was\r\nso much shocked and terror-stricken that I could not speak, to ask the\r\ninformation I so much longed yet dreaded to obtain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgnes!\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, struggling to repress some strong emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Agnes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mary, and burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is he?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, gasping for the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the reply I had anticipated: but the shock seemed none the less\r\ntremendous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father\xe2\x80\x99s mortal remains had been consigned to the tomb; and we, with\r\nsad faces and sombre garments, sat lingering over the frugal\r\nbreakfast-table, revolving plans for our future life. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstrong mind had not given way beneath even this affliction: her spirit,\r\nthough crushed, was not broken. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s wish was that I should go back\r\nto Horton Lodge, and that our mother should come and live with her and\r\nMr. Richardson at the vicarage: she affirmed that he wished it no less\r\nthan herself, and that such an arrangement could not fail to benefit\r\nall parties; for my mother\xe2\x80\x99s society and experience would be of\r\ninestimable value to them, and they would do all they could to make her\r\nhappy. But no arguments or entreaties could prevail: my mother was\r\ndetermined not to go. Not that she questioned, for a moment, the kind\r\nwishes and intentions of her daughter; but she affirmed that so long as\r\nGod spared her health and strength, she would make use of them to earn\r\nher own livelihood, and be chargeable to no one; whether her dependence\r\nwould be felt as a burden or not. If she could afford to reside as a\r\nlodger in \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 vicarage, she would choose that house before all others as\r\nthe place of her abode; but not being so circumstanced, she would never\r\ncome under its roof, except as an occasional visitor: unless sickness\r\nor calamity should render her assistance really needful, or until age\r\nor infirmity made her incapable of maintaining herself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mary,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cif Richardson and you have anything to spare,\r\nyou must lay it aside for your family; and Agnes and I must gather\r\nhoney for ourselves. Thanks to my having had daughters to educate, I\r\nhave not forgotten my accomplishments. God willing, I will check this\r\nvain repining,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, while the tears coursed one another down her\r\ncheeks in spite of her efforts; but she wiped them away, and resolutely\r\nshaking back her head, continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI will exert myself, and look out\r\nfor a small house, commodiously situated in some populous but healthy\r\ndistrict, where we will take a few young ladies to board and educate\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nwe can get them\xe2\x80\x94and as many day pupils as will come, or as we can\r\nmanage to instruct. Your father\xe2\x80\x99s relations and old friends will be\r\nable to send us some pupils, or to assist us with their\r\nrecommendations, no doubt: I shall not apply to my own. What say you to\r\nit, Agnes? will you be willing to leave your present situation and\r\ntry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite willing, mamma; and the money I have saved will do to furnish\r\nthe house. It shall be taken from the bank directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it is wanted: we must get the house, and settle on preliminaries\r\nfirst.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary offered to lend the little she possessed; but my mother declined\r\nit, saying that we must begin on an economical plan; and she hoped that\r\nthe whole or part of mine, added to what we could get by the sale of\r\nthe furniture, and what little our dear papa had contrived to lay aside\r\nfor her since the debts were paid, would be sufficient to last us till\r\nChristmas; when, it was hoped, something would accrue from our united\r\nlabours. It was finally settled that this should be our plan; and that\r\ninquiries and preparations should immediately be set on foot; and while\r\nmy mother busied herself with these, I should return to Horton Lodge at\r\nthe close of my four weeks\xe2\x80\x99 vacation, and give notice for my final\r\ndeparture when things were in train for the speedy commencement of our\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nWe were discussing these affairs on the morning I have mentioned, about\r\na fortnight after my father\xe2\x80\x99s death, when a letter was brought in for\r\nmy mother, on beholding which the colour mounted to her face\xe2\x80\x94lately\r\npale enough with anxious watchings and excessive sorrow. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom my\r\nfather!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured she, as she hastily tore off the cover. It was many\r\nyears since she had heard from any of her own relations before.\r\nNaturally wondering what the letter might contain, I watched her\r\ncountenance while she read it, and was somewhat surprised to see her\r\nbite her lip and knit her brows as if in anger. When she had done, she\r\nsomewhat irreverently cast it on the table, saying with a scornful\r\nsmile,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour grandpapa has been so kind as to write to me. He says he has no\r\ndoubt I have long repented of my \xe2\x80\x98unfortunate marriage,\xe2\x80\x99 and if I will\r\nonly acknowledge this, and confess I was wrong in neglecting his\r\nadvice, and that I have justly suffered for it, he will make a lady of\r\nme once again\xe2\x80\x94if that be possible after my long degradation\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nremember my girls in his will. Get my desk, Agnes, and send these\r\nthings away: I will answer the letter directly. But first, as I may be\r\ndepriving you both of a legacy, it is just that I should tell you what\r\nI mean to say. I shall say that he is mistaken in supposing that I can\r\nregret the birth of my daughters (who have been the pride of my life,\r\nand are likely to be the comfort of my old age), or the thirty years I\r\nhave passed in the company of my best and dearest friend;\xe2\x80\x94that, had our\r\nmisfortunes been three times as great as they were (unless they had\r\nbeen of my bringing on), I should still the more rejoice to have shared\r\nthem with your father, and administered what consolation I was able;\r\nand, had his sufferings in illness been ten times what they were, I\r\ncould not regret having watched over and laboured to relieve\r\nthem;\xe2\x80\x94that, if he had married a richer wife, misfortunes and trials\r\nwould no doubt have come upon him still; while I am egotist enough to\r\nimagine that no other woman could have cheered him through them so\r\nwell: not that I am superior to the rest, but I was made for him, and\r\nhe for me; and I can no more repent the hours, days, years of happiness\r\nwe have spent together, and which neither could have had without the\r\nother, than I can the privilege of having been his nurse in sickness,\r\nand his comfort in affliction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill this do, children?\xe2\x80\x94or shall I say we are all very sorry for what\r\nhas happened during the last thirty years, and my daughters wish they\r\nhad never been born; but since they have had that misfortune, they will\r\nbe thankful for any trifle their grandpapa will be kind enough to\r\nbestow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course, we both applauded our mother\xe2\x80\x99s resolution; Mary cleared away\r\nthe breakfast things; I brought the desk; the letter was quickly\r\nwritten and despatched; and, from that day, we heard no more of our\r\ngrandfather, till we saw his death announced in the newspaper a\r\nconsiderable time after\xe2\x80\x94all his worldly possessions, of course, being\r\nleft to our wealthy unknown cousins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE FAREWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nA house in A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, the fashionable watering-place, was hired for our\r\nseminary; and a promise of two or three pupils was obtained to commence\r\nwith. I returned to Horton Lodge about the middle of July, leaving my\r\nmother to conclude the bargain for the house, to obtain more pupils, to\r\nsell off the furniture of our old abode, and to fit out the new one.\r\n\r\nWe often pity the poor, because they have no leisure to mourn their\r\ndeparted relatives, and necessity obliges them to labour through their\r\nseverest afflictions: but is not active employment the best remedy for\r\noverwhelming sorrow\xe2\x80\x94the surest antidote for despair? It may be a rough\r\ncomforter: it may seem hard to be harassed with the cares of life when\r\nwe have no relish for its enjoyments; to be goaded to labour when the\r\nheart is ready to break, and the vexed spirit implores for rest only to\r\nweep in silence: but is not labour better than the rest we covet? and\r\nare not those petty, tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual\r\nbrooding over the great affliction that oppresses us? Besides, we\r\ncannot have cares, and anxieties, and toil, without hope\xe2\x80\x94if it be but\r\nthe hope of fulfilling our joyless task, accomplishing some needful\r\nproject, or escaping some further annoyance. At any rate, I was glad my\r\nmother had so much employment for every faculty of her action-loving\r\nframe. Our kind neighbours lamented that she, once so exalted in wealth\r\nand station, should be reduced to such extremity in her time of sorrow;\r\nbut I am persuaded that she would have suffered thrice as much had she\r\nbeen left in affluence, with liberty to remain in that house, the scene\r\nof her early happiness and late affliction, and no stern necessity to\r\nprevent her from incessantly brooding over and lamenting her\r\nbereavement.\r\n\r\nI will not dilate upon the feelings with which I left the old house,\r\nthe well-known garden, the little village church\xe2\x80\x94then doubly dear to\r\nme, because my father, who, for thirty years, had taught and prayed\r\nwithin its walls, lay slumbering now beneath its flags\xe2\x80\x94and the old bare\r\nhills, delightful in their very desolation, with the narrow vales\r\nbetween, smiling in green wood and sparkling water\xe2\x80\x94the house where I\r\nwas born, the scene of all my early associations, the place where\r\nthroughout life my earthly affections had been centred;\xe2\x80\x94and left them\r\nto return no more! True, I was going back to Horton Lodge, where, amid\r\nmany evils, one source of pleasure yet remained: but it was pleasure\r\nmingled with excessive pain; and my stay, alas! was limited to six\r\nweeks. And even of that precious time, day after day slipped by and I\r\ndid not see him: except at church, I never saw him for a fortnight\r\nafter my return. It seemed a long time to me: and, as I was often out\r\nwith my rambling pupil, of course hopes would keep rising, and\r\ndisappointments would ensue; and then, I would say to my own heart,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a convincing proof\xe2\x80\x94if you would but have the sense to see it,\r\nor the candour to acknowledge it\xe2\x80\x94that he does not care for you. If he\r\nonly thought _half_ as much about you as you do about him, he would\r\nhave contrived to meet you many times ere this: you must know that, by\r\nconsulting your own feelings. Therefore, have done with this nonsense:\r\nyou have no ground for hope: dismiss, at once, these hurtful thoughts\r\nand foolish wishes from your mind, and turn to your own duty, and the\r\ndull blank life that lies before you. You might have known such\r\nhappiness was not for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I saw him at last. He came suddenly upon me as I was crossing a\r\nfield in returning from a visit to Nancy Brown, which I had taken the\r\nopportunity of paying while Matilda Murray was riding her matchless\r\nmare. He must have heard of the heavy loss I had sustained: he\r\nexpressed no sympathy, offered no condolence: but almost the first\r\nwords he uttered were,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow is your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d And this was no\r\nmatter-of-course question, for I never told him that I had a mother: he\r\nmust have learned the fact from others, if he knew it at all; and,\r\nbesides, there was sincere goodwill, and even deep, touching,\r\nunobtrusive sympathy in the tone and manner of the inquiry. I thanked\r\nhim with due civility, and told him she was as well as could be\r\nexpected. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will she do?\xe2\x80\x9d was the next question. Many would have\r\ndeemed it an impertinent one, and given an evasive reply; but such an\r\nidea never entered my head, and I gave a brief but plain statement of\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s plans and prospects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you will leave this place shortly?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, in a month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused a minute, as if in thought. When he spoke again, I hoped it\r\nwould be to express his concern at my departure; but it was only to\r\nsay,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI should think you will be willing enough to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94for some things,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor _some_ things only\xe2\x80\x94I wonder what should make you regret it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was annoyed at this in some degree; because it embarrassed me: I had\r\nonly one reason for regretting it; and that was a profound secret,\r\nwhich he had no business to trouble me about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy should you suppose that I dislike the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me so yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d was the decisive reply. \xe2\x80\x9cYou said, at least,\r\nthat you could not live contentedly, without a friend; and that you had\r\nno friend here, and no possibility of making one\xe2\x80\x94and, besides, I know\r\nyou _must_ dislike it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you remember rightly, I said, or meant to say, I could not live\r\ncontentedly without a friend in the world: I was not so unreasonable as\r\nto require one always near me. I think I could be happy in a house full\r\nof enemies, if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d but no; that sentence must not be continued\xe2\x80\x94I paused,\r\nand hastily added,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, besides, we cannot well leave a place where we\r\nhave lived for two or three years, without some feeling of regret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you regret to part with Miss Murray, your sole remaining pupil\r\nand companion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say I shall in some degree: it was not without sorrow I parted\r\nwith her sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Miss Matilda is quite as good\xe2\x80\x94better in one respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s honest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the other is not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not call her _dis_honest; but it must be confessed she\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlittle artful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Artful_ is she?\xe2\x80\x94I saw she was giddy and vain\xe2\x80\x94and now,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nafter a pause, \xe2\x80\x9cI can well believe she was artful too; but so\r\nexcessively so as to assume an aspect of extreme simplicity and\r\nunguarded openness. Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d continued he, musingly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat accounts for\r\nsome little things that puzzled me a trifle before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that, he turned the conversation to more general subjects. He did\r\nnot leave me till we had nearly reached the park-gates: he had\r\ncertainly stepped a little out of his way to accompany me so far, for\r\nhe now went back and disappeared down Moss Lane, the entrance of which\r\nwe had passed some time before. Assuredly I did not regret this\r\ncircumstance: if sorrow had any place in my heart, it was that he was\r\ngone at last\xe2\x80\x94that he was no longer walking by my side, and that that\r\nshort interval of delightful intercourse was at an end. He had not\r\nbreathed a word of love, or dropped one hint of tenderness or\r\naffection, and yet I had been supremely happy. To be near him, to hear\r\nhim talk as he did talk, and to feel that he thought me worthy to be so\r\nspoken to\xe2\x80\x94capable of understanding and duly appreciating such\r\ndiscourse\xe2\x80\x94was enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Edward Weston, I could indeed be happy in a house full of\r\nenemies, if I had but one friend, who truly, deeply, and faithfully\r\nloved me; and if that friend were you\xe2\x80\x94though we might be far\r\napart\xe2\x80\x94seldom to hear from each other, still more seldom to meet\xe2\x80\x94though\r\ntoil, and trouble, and vexation might surround me, still\xe2\x80\x94it would be\r\ntoo much happiness for me to dream of! Yet who can tell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I within\r\nmyself, as I proceeded up the park,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwho can tell what this one month\r\nmay bring forth? I have lived nearly three-and-twenty years, and I have\r\nsuffered much, and tasted little pleasure yet; is it likely my life all\r\nthrough will be so clouded? Is it not possible that God may hear my\r\nprayers, disperse these gloomy shadows, and grant me some beams of\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s sunshine yet? Will He entirely deny to me those blessings\r\nwhich are so freely given to others, who neither ask them nor\r\nacknowledge them when received? May I not still hope and trust? I did\r\nhope and trust for a while: but, alas, alas! the time ebbed away: one\r\nweek followed another, and, excepting one distant glimpse and two\r\ntransient meetings\xe2\x80\x94during which scarcely anything was said\xe2\x80\x94while I was\r\nwalking with Miss Matilda, I saw nothing of him: except, of course, at\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the last Sunday was come, and the last service. I was often on\r\nthe point of melting into tears during the sermon\xe2\x80\x94the last I was to\r\nhear from him: the best I should hear from anyone, I was well assured.\r\nIt was over\xe2\x80\x94the congregation were departing; and I must follow. I had\r\nthen seen him, and heard his voice, too, probably for the last time. In\r\nthe churchyard, Matilda was pounced upon by the two Misses Green. They\r\nhad many inquiries to make about her sister, and I know not what\r\nbesides. I only wished they would have done, that we might hasten back\r\nto Horton Lodge: I longed to seek the retirement of my own room, or\r\nsome sequestered nook in the grounds, that I might deliver myself up to\r\nmy feelings\xe2\x80\x94to weep my last farewell, and lament my false hopes and\r\nvain delusions. Only this once, and then adieu to fruitless\r\ndreaming\xe2\x80\x94thenceforth, only sober, solid, sad reality should occupy my\r\nmind. But while I thus resolved, a low voice close beside me said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuppose you are going this week, Miss Grey?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. I was\r\nvery much startled; and had I been at all hysterically inclined, I\r\ncertainly should have committed myself in some way then. Thank God, I\r\nwas not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Weston, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to bid you good-bye\xe2\x80\x94it is not likely I\r\nshall see you again before you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Mr. Weston,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. Oh, how I struggled to say it calmly! I\r\ngave him my hand. He retained it a few seconds in his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible we may meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cwill it be of any\r\nconsequence to you whether we do or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I should be very glad to see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI _could_ say no less. He kindly pressed my hand, and went. Now, I was\r\nhappy again\xe2\x80\x94though more inclined to burst into tears than ever. If I\r\nhad been forced to speak at that moment, a succession of sobs would\r\nhave inevitably ensued; and as it was, I could not keep the water out\r\nof my eyes. I walked along with Miss Murray, turning aside my face, and\r\nneglecting to notice several successive remarks, till she bawled out\r\nthat I was either deaf or stupid; and then (having recovered my\r\nself-possession), as one awakened from a fit of abstraction, I suddenly\r\nlooked up and asked what she had been saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Horton Lodge, and went to join my mother in our new abode at\r\nA\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. I found her well in health, resigned in spirit, and even cheerful,\r\nthough subdued and sober, in her general demeanour. We had only three\r\nboarders and half a dozen day-pupils to commence with; but by due care\r\nand diligence we hoped ere long to increase the number of both.\r\n\r\nI set myself with befitting energy to discharge the duties of this new\r\nmode of life. I call it _new_, for there was, indeed, a considerable\r\ndifference between working with my mother in a school of our own, and\r\nworking as a hireling among strangers, despised and trampled upon by\r\nold and young; and for the first few weeks I was by no means unhappy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible we may meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwill it be of any consequence\r\nto you whether we do or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Those words still rang in my ear and\r\nrested on my heart: they were my secret solace and support. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nsee him again.\xe2\x80\x94He will come; or he will write.\xe2\x80\x9d No promise, in fact,\r\nwas too bright or too extravagant for Hope to whisper in my ear. I did\r\nnot believe half of what she told me: I pretended to laugh at it all;\r\nbut I was far more credulous than I myself supposed; otherwise, why did\r\nmy heart leap up when a knock was heard at the front door, and the\r\nmaid, who opened it, came to tell my mother a gentleman wished to see\r\nher? and why was I out of humour for the rest of the day, because it\r\nproved to be a music-master come to offer his services to our school?\r\nand what stopped my breath for a moment, when the postman having\r\nbrought a couple of letters, my mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cHere, Agnes, this is for\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d and threw one of them to me? and what made the hot blood rush\r\ninto my face when I saw it was directed in a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s hand? and\r\nwhy\xe2\x80\x94oh! why did that cold, sickening sense of disappointment fall upon\r\nme, when I had torn open the cover and found it was _only_ a letter\r\nfrom Mary, which, for some reason or other, her husband had directed\r\nfor her?\r\n\r\nWas it then come to this\xe2\x80\x94that I should be _disappointed_ to receive a\r\nletter from my only sister: and because it was not written by a\r\ncomparative stranger? Dear Mary! and she had written it so kindly\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthinking I should be so pleased to have it!\xe2\x80\x94I was not worthy to read\r\nit! And I believe, in my indignation against myself, I should have put\r\nit aside till I had schooled myself into a better frame of mind, and\r\nwas become more deserving of the honour and privilege of its perusal:\r\nbut there was my mother looking on, and wishful to know what news it\r\ncontained; so I read it and delivered it to her, and then went into the\r\nschoolroom to attend to the pupils: but amidst the cares of copies and\r\nsums\xe2\x80\x94in the intervals of correcting errors here, and reproving\r\nderelictions of duty there, I was inwardly taking myself to task with\r\nfar sterner severity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fool you must be,\xe2\x80\x9d said my head to my\r\nheart, or my sterner to my softer self;\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chow could you ever dream that\r\nhe would write to you? What grounds have you for such a hope\xe2\x80\x94or that he\r\nwill see you, or give himself any trouble about you\xe2\x80\x94or even think of\r\nyou again?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat grounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and then Hope set before me that last,\r\nshort interview, and repeated the words I had so faithfully treasured\r\nin my memory. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what was there in that?\xe2\x80\x94Who ever hung his\r\nhopes upon so frail a twig? What was there in those words that any\r\ncommon acquaintance might not say to another? Of course, it was\r\npossible you might meet again: he might have said so if you had been\r\ngoing to New Zealand; but that did not imply any _intention_ of seeing\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94and then, as to the question that followed, anyone might ask that:\r\nand how did you answer?\xe2\x80\x94Merely with a stupid, commonplace reply, such\r\nas you would have given to Master Murray, or anyone else you had been\r\non tolerably civil terms with.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut, then,\xe2\x80\x9d persisted Hope, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tone\r\nand manner in which he spoke.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that is nonsense! he always speaks\r\nimpressively; and at that moment there were the Greens and Miss Matilda\r\nMurray just before, and other people passing by, and he was obliged to\r\nstand close beside you, and to speak very low, unless he wished\r\neverybody to hear what he said, which\xe2\x80\x94though it was nothing at all\r\nparticular\xe2\x80\x94of course, he would rather not.\xe2\x80\x9d But then, above all, that\r\nemphatic, yet gentle pressure of the hand, which seemed to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Trust_ me;\xe2\x80\x9d and many other things besides\xe2\x80\x94too delightful, almost too\r\nflattering, to be repeated even to one\xe2\x80\x99s self. \xe2\x80\x9cEgregious folly\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nabsurd to require contradiction\xe2\x80\x94mere inventions of the imagination,\r\nwhich you ought to be ashamed of. If you would but consider your own\r\nunattractive exterior, your unamiable reserve, your foolish\r\ndiffidence\xe2\x80\x94which must make you appear cold, dull, awkward, and perhaps\r\nill-tempered too;\xe2\x80\x94if you had but rightly considered these from the\r\nbeginning, you would never have harboured such presumptuous thoughts:\r\nand now that you have been so foolish, pray repent and amend, and let\r\nus have no more of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I implicitly obeyed my own injunctions: but such\r\nreasoning as this became more and more effective as time wore on, and\r\nnothing was seen or heard of Mr. Weston; until, at last, I gave up\r\nhoping, for even my heart acknowledged it was all in vain. But still, I\r\nwould think of him: I would cherish his image in my mind; and treasure\r\nevery word, look, and gesture that my memory could retain; and brood\r\nover his excellences and his peculiarities, and, in fact, all I had\r\nseen, heard, or imagined respecting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgnes, this sea air and change of scene do you no good, I think: I\r\nnever saw you look so wretched. It must be that you sit too much, and\r\nallow the cares of the schoolroom to worry you. You must learn to take\r\nthings easy, and to be more active and cheerful; you must take exercise\r\nwhenever you can get it, and leave the most tiresome duties to me: they\r\nwill only serve to exercise my patience, and, perhaps, try my temper a\r\nlittle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo said my mother, as we sat at work one morning during the Easter\r\nholidays. I assured her that my employments were not at all oppressive;\r\nthat I was well; or, if there was anything amiss, it would be gone as\r\nsoon as the trying months of spring were over: when summer came I\r\nshould be as strong and hearty as she could wish to see me: but\r\ninwardly her observation startled me. I knew my strength was declining,\r\nmy appetite had failed, and I was grown listless and desponding;\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nif, indeed, he could never care for me, and I could never see him\r\nmore\xe2\x80\x94if I was forbidden to minister to his happiness\xe2\x80\x94forbidden, for\r\never, to taste the joys of love, to bless, and to be blessed\xe2\x80\x94then, life\r\nmust be a burden, and if my heavenly Father would call me away, I\r\nshould be glad to rest. But it would not do to die and leave my mother.\r\nSelfish, unworthy daughter, to forget her for a moment! Was not her\r\nhappiness committed in a great measure to my charge?\xe2\x80\x94and the welfare of\r\nour young pupils too? Should I shrink from the work that God had set\r\nbefore me, because it was not fitted to my taste? Did not He know best\r\nwhat I should do, and where I ought to labour?\xe2\x80\x94and should I long to\r\nquit His service before I had finished my task, and expect to enter\r\ninto His rest without having laboured to earn it? \xe2\x80\x9cNo; by His help I\r\nwill arise and address myself diligently to my appointed duty. If\r\nhappiness in this world is not for me, I will endeavour to promote the\r\nwelfare of those around me, and my reward shall be hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d So said\r\nI in my heart; and from that hour I only permitted my thoughts to\r\nwander to Edward Weston\xe2\x80\x94or at least to dwell upon him now and then\xe2\x80\x94as a\r\ntreat for rare occasions: and, whether it was really the approach of\r\nsummer or the effect of these good resolutions, or the lapse of time,\r\nor all together, tranquillity of mind was soon restored; and bodily\r\nhealth and vigour began likewise, slowly, but surely, to return.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, I received a letter from Lady Ashby, late Miss Murray.\r\nShe had written to me twice or thrice before, from the different stages\r\nof her bridal tour, always in good spirits, and professing to be very\r\nhappy. I wondered every time that she had not forgotten me, in the\r\nmidst of so much gaiety and variety of scene. At length, however, there\r\nwas a pause; and it seemed she had forgotten me, for upwards of seven\r\nmonths passed away and no letter. Of course, I did not break my heart\r\nabout _that_, though I often wondered how she was getting on; and when\r\nthis last epistle so unexpectedly arrived, I was glad enough to receive\r\nit. It was dated from Ashby Park, where she was come to settle down at\r\nlast, having previously divided her time between the continent and the\r\nmetropolis. She made many apologies for having neglected me so long,\r\nassured me she had not forgotten me, and had often intended to write,\r\n&c. &c., but had always been prevented by something. She acknowledged\r\nthat she had been leading a very dissipated life, and I should think\r\nher very wicked and very thoughtless; but, notwithstanding that, she\r\nthought a great deal, and, among other things, that she should vastly\r\nlike to see me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been several days here already,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not a single friend with us, and are likely to be very dull.\r\nYou know I never had a fancy for living with my husband like two\r\nturtles in a nest, were he the most delightful creature that ever wore\r\na coat; so do take pity upon me and come. I suppose your Midsummer\r\nholidays commence in June, the same as other people\xe2\x80\x99s; therefore you\r\ncannot plead want of time; and you must and shall come\xe2\x80\x94in fact, I shall\r\ndie if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. I want you to visit me as a friend, and stay a long\r\ntime. There is nobody with me, as I told you before, but Sir Thomas and\r\nold Lady Ashby: but you needn\xe2\x80\x99t mind them\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble us but little\r\nwith their company. And you shall have a room to yourself, whenever you\r\nlike to retire to it, and plenty of books to read when my company is\r\nnot sufficiently amusing. I forget whether you like babies; if you do,\r\nyou may have the pleasure of seeing mine\xe2\x80\x94the most charming child in the\r\nworld, no doubt; and all the more so, that I am not troubled with\r\nnursing it\xe2\x80\x94I was determined I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered with that.\r\nUnfortunately, it is a girl, and Sir Thomas has never forgiven me: but,\r\nhowever, if you will only come, I promise you shall be its governess as\r\nsoon as it can speak; and you shall bring it up in the way it should\r\ngo, and make a better woman of it than its mamma. And you shall see my\r\npoodle, too: a splendid little charmer imported from Paris: and two\r\nfine Italian paintings of great value\xe2\x80\x94I forget the artist. Doubtless\r\nyou will be able to discover prodigious beauties in them, which you\r\nmust point out to me, as I only admire by hearsay; and many elegant\r\ncuriosities besides, which I purchased at Rome and elsewhere; and,\r\nfinally, you shall see my new home\xe2\x80\x94the splendid house and grounds I\r\nused to covet so greatly. Alas! how far the promise of anticipation\r\nexceeds the pleasure of possession! There\xe2\x80\x99s a fine sentiment! I assure\r\nyou I am become quite a grave old matron: pray come, if it be only to\r\nwitness the wonderful change. Write by return of post, and tell me when\r\nyour vacation commences, and say that you will come the day after, and\r\nstay till the day before it closes\xe2\x80\x94in mercy to\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours affectionately,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cROSALIE ASHBY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nI showed this strange epistle to my mother, and consulted her on what I\r\nought to do. She advised me to go; and I went\xe2\x80\x94willing enough to see\r\nLady Ashby, and her baby, too, and to do anything I could to benefit\r\nher, by consolation or advice; for I imagined she must be unhappy, or\r\nshe would not have applied to me thus\xe2\x80\x94but feeling, as may readily be\r\nconceived, that, in accepting the invitation, I made a great sacrifice\r\nfor her, and did violence to my feelings in many ways, instead of being\r\ndelighted with the honourable distinction of being entreated by the\r\nbaronet\xe2\x80\x99s lady to visit her as a friend. However, I determined my visit\r\nshould be only for a few days at most; and I will not deny that I\r\nderived some consolation from the idea that, as Ashby Park was not very\r\nfar from Horton, I might possibly see Mr. Weston, or, at least, hear\r\nsomething about him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE VISIT\r\n\r\n\r\nAshby Park was certainly a very delightful residence. The mansion was\r\nstately without, commodious and elegant within; the park was spacious\r\nand beautiful, chiefly on account of its magnificent old trees, its\r\nstately herds of deer, its broad sheet of water, and the ancient woods\r\nthat stretched beyond it: for there was no broken ground to give\r\nvariety to the landscape, and but very little of that undulating swell\r\nwhich adds so greatly to the charm of park scenery. And so, this was\r\nthe place Rosalie Murray had so longed to call her own, that she must\r\nhave a share of it, on whatever terms it might be offered\xe2\x80\x94whatever\r\nprice was to be paid for the title of mistress, and whoever was to be\r\nher partner in the honour and bliss of such a possession! Well I am not\r\ndisposed to censure her now.\r\n\r\nShe received me very kindly; and, though I was a poor clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, a governess, and a schoolmistress, she welcomed me with\r\nunaffected pleasure to her home; and\xe2\x80\x94what surprised me rather\xe2\x80\x94took some\r\npains to make my visit agreeable. I could see, it is true, that she\r\nexpected me to be greatly struck with the magnificence that surrounded\r\nher; and, I confess, I was rather annoyed at her evident efforts to\r\nreassure me, and prevent me from being overwhelmed by so much\r\ngrandeur\xe2\x80\x94too much awed at the idea of encountering her husband and\r\nmother-in-law, or too much ashamed of my own humble appearance. I was\r\nnot ashamed of it at all; for, though plain, I had taken good care not\r\nto be shabby or mean, and should have been pretty considerably at my\r\nease, if my condescending hostess had not taken such manifest pains to\r\nmake me so; and, as for the magnificence that surrounded her, nothing\r\nthat met my eyes struck me or affected me half so much as her own\r\naltered appearance. Whether from the influence of fashionable\r\ndissipation, or some other evil, a space of little more than twelve\r\nmonths had had the effect that might be expected from as many years, in\r\nreducing the plumpness of her form, the freshness of her complexion,\r\nthe vivacity of her movements, and the exuberance of her spirits.\r\n\r\nI wished to know if she was unhappy; but I felt it was not my province\r\nto inquire: I might endeavour to win her confidence; but, if she chose\r\nto conceal her matrimonial cares from me, I would trouble her with no\r\nobtrusive questions. I, therefore, at first, confined myself to a few\r\ngeneral inquiries about her health and welfare, and a few commendations\r\non the beauty of the park, and of the little girl that should have been\r\na boy: a small delicate infant of seven or eight weeks old, whom its\r\nmother seemed to regard with no remarkable degree of interest or\r\naffection, though full as much as I expected her to show.\r\n\r\nShortly after my arrival, she commissioned her maid to conduct me to my\r\nroom and see that I had everything I wanted; it was a small,\r\nunpretending, but sufficiently comfortable apartment. When I descended\r\nthence\xe2\x80\x94having divested myself of all travelling encumbrances, and\r\narranged my toilet with due consideration for the feelings of my lady\r\nhostess, she conducted me herself to the room I was to occupy when I\r\nchose to be alone, or when she was engaged with visitors, or obliged to\r\nbe with her mother-in-law, or otherwise prevented, as she said, from\r\nenjoying the pleasure of my society. It was a quiet, tidy little\r\nsitting-room; and I was not sorry to be provided with such a harbour of\r\nrefuge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd some time,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI will show you the library: I never\r\nexamined its shelves, but, I daresay, it is full of wise books; and you\r\nmay go and burrow among them whenever you please. And now you shall\r\nhave some tea\xe2\x80\x94it will soon be dinner-time, but I thought, as you were\r\naccustomed to dine at one, you would perhaps like better to have a cup\r\nof tea about this time, and to dine when we lunch: and then, you know,\r\nyou can have your tea in this room, and that will save you from having\r\nto dine with Lady Ashby and Sir Thomas: which would be rather\r\nawkward\xe2\x80\x94at least, not awkward, but rather\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94you know what I mean. I\r\nthought you mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like it so well\xe2\x80\x94especially as we may have other\r\nladies and gentlemen to dine with us occasionally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI would much rather have it as you say, and, if\r\nyou have no objection, I should prefer having all my meals in this\r\nroom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, I imagine, it would be more agreeable to Lady Ashby and Sir\r\nThomas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate it would be more agreeable to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe made some faint objections, but soon conceded; and I could see that\r\nthe proposal was a considerable relief to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, come into the drawing-room,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the dressing\r\nbell; but I won\xe2\x80\x99t go yet: it\xe2\x80\x99s no use dressing when there\xe2\x80\x99s no one to\r\nsee you; and I want to have a little discourse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room was certainly an imposing apartment, and very\r\nelegantly furnished; but I saw its young mistress glance towards me as\r\nwe entered, as if to notice how I was impressed by the spectacle, and\r\naccordingly I determined to preserve an aspect of stony indifference,\r\nas if I saw nothing at all remarkable. But this was only for a moment:\r\nimmediately conscience whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I disappoint her to save\r\nmy pride? No\xe2\x80\x94rather let me sacrifice my pride to give her a little\r\ninnocent gratification.\xe2\x80\x9d And I honestly looked round, and told her it\r\nwas a noble room, and very tastefully furnished. She said little, but I\r\nsaw she was pleased.\r\n\r\nShe showed me her fat French poodle, that lay curled up on a silk\r\ncushion, and the two fine Italian paintings: which, however, she would\r\nnot give me time to examine, but, saying I must look at them some other\r\nday, insisted upon my admiring the little jewelled watch she had\r\npurchased in Geneva; and then she took me round the room to point out\r\nsundry articles of _vertu_ she had brought from Italy: an elegant\r\nlittle timepiece, and several busts, small graceful figures, and vases,\r\nall beautifully carved in white marble. She spoke of these with\r\nanimation, and heard my admiring comments with a smile of pleasure:\r\nthat soon, however, vanished, and was followed by a melancholy sigh; as\r\nif in consideration of the insufficiency of all such baubles to the\r\nhappiness of the human heart, and their woeful inability to supply its\r\ninsatiate demands.\r\n\r\nThen, stretching herself upon a couch, she motioned me to a capacious\r\neasy-chair that stood opposite\xe2\x80\x94not before the fire, but before a wide\r\nopen window; for it was summer, be it remembered; a sweet, warm evening\r\nin the latter half of June. I sat for a moment in silence, enjoying the\r\nstill, pure air, and the delightful prospect of the park that lay\r\nbefore me, rich in verdure and foliage, and basking in yellow sunshine,\r\nrelieved by the long shadows of declining day. But I must take\r\nadvantage of this pause: I had inquiries to make, and, like the\r\nsubstance of a lady\xe2\x80\x99s postscript, the most important must come last. So\r\nI began with asking after Mr. and Mrs. Murray, and Miss Matilda and the\r\nyoung gentlemen.\r\n\r\nI was told that papa had the gout, which made him very ferocious; and\r\nthat he would not give up his choice wines, and his substantial dinners\r\nand suppers, and had quarrelled with his physician, because the latter\r\nhad dared to say that no medicine could cure him while he lived so\r\nfreely; that mamma and the rest were well. Matilda was still wild and\r\nreckless, but she had got a fashionable governess, and was considerably\r\nimproved in her manners, and soon to be introduced to the world; and\r\nJohn and Charles (now at home for the holidays) were, by all accounts,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfine, bold, unruly, mischievous boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are the other people getting on?\xe2\x80\x9d said I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe Greens, for\r\ninstance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mr. Green is heart-broken, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, with a languid\r\nsmile: \xe2\x80\x9che hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got over his disappointment yet, and never will, I\r\nsuppose. He\xe2\x80\x99s doomed to be an old bachelor; and his sisters are doing\r\ntheir best to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the Melthams?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, they\xe2\x80\x99re jogging on as usual, I suppose: but I know very little\r\nabout any of them\xe2\x80\x94except Harry,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, blushing slightly, and\r\nsmiling again. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw a great deal of him while we were in London; for,\r\nas soon as he heard we were there, he came up under pretence of\r\nvisiting his brother, and either followed me, like a shadow, wherever I\r\nwent, or met me, like a reflection, at every turn. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t look so\r\nshocked, Miss Grey; I was very discreet, I assure you, but, you know,\r\none can\xe2\x80\x99t help being admired. Poor fellow! He was not my only\r\nworshipper; though he was certainly the most conspicuous, and, I think,\r\nthe most devoted among them all. And that detestable\xe2\x80\x94ahem\xe2\x80\x94and Sir\r\nThomas chose to take offence at him\xe2\x80\x94or my profuse expenditure, or\r\nsomething\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know what\xe2\x80\x94and hurried me down to the country\r\nat a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice; where I\xe2\x80\x99m to play the hermit, I suppose, for\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she bit her lip, and frowned vindictively upon the fair domain she\r\nhad once so coveted to call her own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Hatfield,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is become of him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain she brightened up, and answered gaily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh! he made up to an\r\nelderly spinster, and married her, not long since; weighing her heavy\r\npurse against her faded charms, and expecting to find that solace in\r\ngold which was denied him in love\xe2\x80\x94ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94except Mr. Weston: what is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone from Horton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long since? and where is he gone to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, yawning\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexcept that he went\r\nabout a month ago\xe2\x80\x94I never asked where\xe2\x80\x9d(I would have asked whether it\r\nwas to a living or merely another curacy, but thought it better not);\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the people made a great rout about his leaving,\xe2\x80\x9d continued she,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmuch to Mr. Hatfield\xe2\x80\x99s displeasure; for Hatfield didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him,\r\nbecause he had too much influence with the common people, and because\r\nhe was not sufficiently tractable and submissive to him\xe2\x80\x94and for some\r\nother unpardonable sins, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what. But now I positively must\r\ngo and dress: the second bell will ring directly, and if I come to\r\ndinner in this guise, I shall never hear the end of it from Lady Ashby.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a strange thing one can\xe2\x80\x99t be mistress in one\xe2\x80\x99s own house! Just\r\nring the bell, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send for my maid, and tell them to get you some\r\ntea. Only think of that intolerable woman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x94your maid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo;\xe2\x80\x94my mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x94and my unfortunate mistake! Instead of letting\r\nher take herself off to some other house, as she offered to do when I\r\nmarried, I was fool enough to ask her to live here still, and direct\r\nthe affairs of the house for me; because, in the first place, I hoped\r\nwe should spend the greater part of the year, in town, and in the\r\nsecond place, being so young and inexperienced, I was frightened at the\r\nidea of having a houseful of servants to manage, and dinners to order,\r\nand parties to entertain, and all the rest of it, and I thought she\r\nmight assist me with her experience; never dreaming she would prove a\r\nusurper, a tyrant, an incubus, a spy, and everything else that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndetestable. I wish she was dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe then turned to give her orders to the footman, who had been\r\nstanding bolt upright within the door for the last half minute, and had\r\nheard the latter part of her animadversions; and, of course, made his\r\nown reflections upon them, notwithstanding the inflexible, wooden\r\ncountenance he thought proper to preserve in the drawing-room. On my\r\nremarking afterwards that he must have heard her, she replied\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no\r\nmatter! I never care about the footmen; they\xe2\x80\x99re mere automatons: it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnothing to them what their superiors say or do; they won\xe2\x80\x99t dare to\r\nrepeat it; and as to what they think\xe2\x80\x94if they presume to think at all\xe2\x80\x94of\r\ncourse, nobody cares for that. It would be a pretty thing indeed, it we\r\nwere to be tongue-tied by our servants!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she ran off to make her hasty toilet, leaving me to pilot my\r\nway back to my sitting-room, where, in due time, I was served with a\r\ncup of tea. After that, I sat musing on Lady Ashby\xe2\x80\x99s past and present\r\ncondition; and on what little information I had obtained respecting Mr.\r\nWeston, and the small chance there was of ever seeing or hearing\r\nanything more of him throughout my quiet, drab-colour life: which,\r\nhenceforth, seemed to offer no alternative between positive rainy days,\r\nand days of dull grey clouds without downfall. At length, however, I\r\nbegan to weary of my thoughts, and to wish I knew where to find the\r\nlibrary my hostess had spoken of; and to wonder whether I was to remain\r\nthere doing nothing till bed-time.\r\n\r\nAs I was not rich enough to possess a watch, I could not tell how time\r\nwas passing, except by observing the slowly lengthening shadows from\r\nthe window; which presented a side view, including a corner of the\r\npark, a clump of trees whose topmost branches had been colonized by an\r\ninnumerable company of noisy rooks, and a high wall with a massive\r\nwooden gate: no doubt communicating with the stable-yard, as a broad\r\ncarriage-road swept up to it from the park. The shadow of this wall\r\nsoon took possession of the whole of the ground as far as I could see,\r\nforcing the golden sunlight to retreat inch by inch, and at last take\r\nrefuge in the very tops of the trees. Ere long, even they were left in\r\nshadow\xe2\x80\x94the shadow of the distant hills, or of the earth itself; and, in\r\nsympathy for the busy citizens of the rookery, I regretted to see their\r\nhabitation, so lately bathed in glorious light, reduced to the sombre,\r\nwork-a-day hue of the lower world, or of my own world within. For a\r\nmoment, such birds as soared above the rest might still receive the\r\nlustre on their wings, which imparted to their sable plumage the hue\r\nand brilliance of deep red gold; at last, that too departed. Twilight\r\ncame stealing on; the rooks became more quiet; I became more weary, and\r\nwished I were going home to-morrow. At length it grew dark; and I was\r\nthinking of ringing for a candle, and betaking myself to bed, when my\r\nhostess appeared, with many apologies for having neglected me so long,\r\nand laying all the blame upon that \xe2\x80\x9cnasty old woman,\xe2\x80\x9d as she called her\r\nmother-in-law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t sit with her in the drawing-room while Sir Thomas is\r\ntaking his wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would never forgive me; and then, if I\r\nleave the room the instant he comes\xe2\x80\x94as I have done once or twice\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nan unpardonable offence against her dear Thomas. _She_ never showed\r\nsuch disrespect to _her_ husband: and as for affection, wives never\r\nthink of that now-a-days, she supposes: but things were different in\r\n_her_ time\xe2\x80\x94as if there was any good to be done by staying in the room,\r\nwhen he does nothing but grumble and scold when he\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad humour,\r\ntalk disgusting nonsense when he\xe2\x80\x99s in a good one, and go to sleep on\r\nthe sofa when he\xe2\x80\x99s too stupid for either; which is most frequently the\r\ncase now, when he has nothing to do but to sot over his wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut could you not try to occupy his mind with something better; and\r\nengage him to give up such habits? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have powers of\r\npersuasion, and qualifications for amusing a gentleman, which many\r\nladies would be glad to possess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you think I would lay myself out for his amusement! No: that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot _my_ idea of a wife. It\xe2\x80\x99s the husband\xe2\x80\x99s part to please the wife,\r\nnot hers to please him; and if he isn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with her as she\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94and thankful to possess her too\xe2\x80\x94he isn\xe2\x80\x99t worthy of her, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\r\nAnd as for persuasion, I assure you I shan\xe2\x80\x99t trouble myself with that:\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve enough to do to bear with him as he is, without attempting to work\r\na reform. But I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I left you so long alone, Miss Grey. How have\r\nyou passed the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChiefly in watching the rooks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy, how dull you must have been! I really must show you the\r\nlibrary; and you must ring for everything you want, just as you would\r\nin an inn, and make yourself comfortable. I have selfish reasons for\r\nwishing to make you happy, because I want you to stay with me, and not\r\nfulfil your horrid threat of running away in a day or two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t let me keep you out of the drawing-room any longer\r\nto-night, for at present I am tired and wish to go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nTHE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nI came down a little before eight, next morning, as I knew by the\r\nstriking of a distant clock. There was no appearance of breakfast. I\r\nwaited above an hour before it came, still vainly longing for access to\r\nthe library; and, after that lonely repast was concluded, I waited\r\nagain about an hour and a half in great suspense and discomfort,\r\nuncertain what to do. At length Lady Ashby came to bid me good-morning.\r\nShe informed me she had only just breakfasted, and now wanted me to\r\ntake an early walk with her in the park. She asked how long I had been\r\nup, and on receiving my answer, expressed the deepest regret, and again\r\npromised to show me the library. I suggested she had better do so at\r\nonce, and then there would be no further trouble either with\r\nremembering or forgetting. She complied, on condition that I would not\r\nthink of reading, or bothering with the books now; for she wanted to\r\nshow me the gardens, and take a walk in the park with me, before it\r\nbecame too hot for enjoyment; which, indeed, was nearly the case\r\nalready. Of course I readily assented; and we took our walk\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nAs we were strolling in the park, talking of what my companion had seen\r\nand heard during her travelling experience, a gentleman on horseback\r\nrode up and passed us. As he turned, in passing, and stared me full in\r\nthe face, I had a good opportunity of seeing what he was like. He was\r\ntall, thin, and wasted, with a slight stoop in the shoulders, a pale\r\nface, but somewhat blotchy, and disagreeably red about the eyelids,\r\nplain features, and a general appearance of languor and flatness,\r\nrelieved by a sinister expression in the mouth and the dull, soulless\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI detest that man!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Lady Ashby, with bitter emphasis, as he\r\nslowly trotted by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, unwilling to suppose that she should so speak of\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir Thomas Ashby,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, with dreary composure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you _detest_ him, Miss Murray?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, for I was too much\r\nshocked to remember her name at the moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do, Miss Grey, and despise him too; and if you knew him you\r\nwould not blame me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you knew what he was before you married him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I only thought so: I did not half know him really. I know you\r\nwarned me against it, and I wish I had listened to you: but it\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nlate to regret that now. And besides, mamma ought to have known better\r\nthan either of us, and she never said anything against it\xe2\x80\x94quite the\r\ncontrary. And then I thought he adored me, and would let me have my own\r\nway: he did pretend to do so at first, but now he does not care a bit\r\nabout me. Yet I should not care for that: he might do as he pleased, if\r\nI might only be free to amuse myself and to stay in London, or have a\r\nfew friends down here: but _he will_ do as he pleases, and I must be a\r\nprisoner and a slave. The moment he saw I could enjoy myself without\r\nhim, and that others knew my value better than himself, the selfish\r\nwretch began to accuse me of coquetry and extravagance; and to abuse\r\nHarry Meltham, whose shoes he was not worthy to clean. And then he must\r\nneeds have me down in the country, to lead the life of a nun, lest I\r\nshould dishonour him or bring him to ruin; as if he had not been ten\r\ntimes worse every way, with his betting-book, and his gaming-table, and\r\nhis opera-girls, and his Lady This and Mrs. That\xe2\x80\x94yes, and his bottles\r\nof wine, and glasses of brandy-and-water too! Oh, I would give ten\r\nthousand worlds to be Miss Murray again! It is _too_ bad to feel life,\r\nhealth, and beauty wasting away, unfelt and unenjoyed, for such a brute\r\nas that!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed she, fairly bursting into tears in the bitterness\r\nof her vexation.\r\n\r\nOf course, I pitied her exceedingly; as well for her false idea of\r\nhappiness and disregard of duty, as for the wretched partner with whom\r\nher fate was linked. I said what I could to comfort her, and offered\r\nsuch counsels as I thought she most required: advising her, first, by\r\ngentle reasoning, by kindness, example, and persuasion, to try to\r\nameliorate her husband; and then, when she had done all she could, if\r\nshe still found him incorrigible, to endeavour to abstract herself from\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94to wrap herself up in her own integrity, and trouble herself as\r\nlittle about him as possible. I exhorted her to seek consolation in\r\ndoing her duty to God and man, to put her trust in Heaven, and solace\r\nherself with the care and nurture of her little daughter; assuring her\r\nshe would be amply rewarded by witnessing its progress in strength and\r\nwisdom, and receiving its genuine affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t devote myself entirely to a child,\xe2\x80\x9d said she; \xe2\x80\x9cit may\r\ndie\xe2\x80\x94which is not at all improbable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, with care, many a delicate infant has become a strong man or\r\nwoman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it may grow so intolerably like its father that I shall hate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not likely; it is a little girl, and strongly resembles its\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter; I should like it better if it were a boy\xe2\x80\x94only that its\r\nfather will leave it no inheritance that he can possibly squander away.\r\nWhat pleasure can I have in seeing a girl grow up to eclipse me, and\r\nenjoy those pleasures that I am for ever debarred from? But supposing I\r\ncould be so generous as to take delight in this, still it is _only_ a\r\nchild; and I can\xe2\x80\x99t centre all my hopes in a child: that is only one\r\ndegree better than devoting oneself to a dog. And as for all the wisdom\r\nand goodness you have been trying to instil into me\xe2\x80\x94that is all very\r\nright and proper, I daresay, and if I were some twenty years older, I\r\nmight fructify by it: but people must enjoy themselves when they are\r\nyoung; and if others won\xe2\x80\x99t let them\xe2\x80\x94why, they must hate them for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best way to enjoy yourself is to do what is right and hate nobody.\r\nThe end of Religion is not to teach us how to die, but how to live; and\r\nthe earlier you become wise and good, the more of happiness you secure.\r\nAnd now, Lady Ashby, I have one more piece of advice to offer you,\r\nwhich is, that you will not make an enemy of your mother-in-law. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget into the way of holding her at arms\xe2\x80\x99 length, and regarding her with\r\njealous distrust. I never saw her, but I have heard good as well as\r\nevil respecting her; and I imagine that, though cold and haughty in her\r\ngeneral demeanour, and even exacting in her requirements, she has\r\nstrong affections for those who can reach them; and, though so blindly\r\nattached to her son, she is not without good principles, or incapable\r\nof hearing reason. If you would but conciliate her a little, and adopt\r\na friendly, open manner\xe2\x80\x94and even confide your grievances to her\xe2\x80\x94real\r\ngrievances, such as you have a right to complain of\xe2\x80\x94it is my firm\r\nbelief that she would, in time, become your faithful friend, and a\r\ncomfort and support to you, instead of the incubus you describe her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBut I fear my advice had little effect upon the unfortunate young lady;\r\nand, finding I could render myself so little serviceable, my residence\r\nat Ashby Park became doubly painful. But still, I must stay out that\r\nday and the following one, as I had promised to do so: though,\r\nresisting all entreaties and inducements to prolong my visit further, I\r\ninsisted upon departing the next morning; affirming that my mother\r\nwould be lonely without me, and that she impatiently expected my\r\nreturn. Nevertheless, it was with a heavy heart that I bade adieu to\r\npoor Lady Ashby, and left her in her princely home. It was no slight\r\nadditional proof of her unhappiness, that she should so cling to the\r\nconsolation of my presence, and earnestly desire the company of one\r\nwhose general tastes and ideas were so little congenial to her own\xe2\x80\x94whom\r\nshe had completely forgotten in her hour of prosperity, and whose\r\npresence would be rather a nuisance than a pleasure, if she could but\r\nhave half her heart\xe2\x80\x99s desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTHE SANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur school was not situated in the heart of the town: on entering A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\nfrom the north-west there is a row of respectable-looking houses, on\r\neach side of the broad, white road, with narrow slips of garden-ground\r\nbefore them, Venetian blinds to the windows, and a flight of steps\r\nleading to each trim, brass-handled door. In one of the largest of\r\nthese habitations dwelt my mother and I, with such young ladies as our\r\nfriends and the public chose to commit to our charge. Consequently, we\r\nwere a considerable distance from the sea, and divided from it by a\r\nlabyrinth of streets and houses. But the sea was my delight; and I\r\nwould often gladly pierce the town to obtain the pleasure of a walk\r\nbeside it, whether with the pupils, or alone with my mother during the\r\nvacations. It was delightful to me at all times and seasons, but\r\nespecially in the wild commotion of a rough sea-breeze, and in the\r\nbrilliant freshness of a summer morning.\r\n\r\nI awoke early on the third morning after my return from Ashby Park\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsun was shining through the blind, and I thought how pleasant it would\r\nbe to pass through the quiet town and take a solitary ramble on the\r\nsands while half the world was in bed. I was not long in forming the\r\nresolution, nor slow to act upon it. Of course I would not disturb my\r\nmother, so I stole noiselessly downstairs, and quietly unfastened the\r\ndoor. I was dressed and out, when the church clock struck a quarter to\r\nsix. There was a feeling of freshness and vigour in the very streets;\r\nand when I got free of the town, when my foot was on the sands and my\r\nface towards the broad, bright bay, no language can describe the effect\r\nof the deep, clear azure of the sky and ocean, the bright morning\r\nsunshine on the semicircular barrier of craggy cliffs surmounted by\r\ngreen swelling hills, and on the smooth, wide sands, and the low rocks\r\nout at sea\xe2\x80\x94looking, with their clothing of weeds and moss, like little\r\ngrass-grown islands\xe2\x80\x94and above all, on the brilliant, sparkling waves.\r\nAnd then, the unspeakable purity\xe2\x80\x94and freshness of the air! There was\r\njust enough heat to enhance the value of the breeze, and just enough\r\nwind to keep the whole sea in motion, to make the waves come bounding\r\nto the shore, foaming and sparkling, as if wild with glee. Nothing else\r\nwas stirring\xe2\x80\x94no living creature was visible besides myself. My\r\nfootsteps were the first to press the firm, unbroken sands;\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nbefore had trampled them since last night\xe2\x80\x99s flowing tide had\r\nobliterated the deepest marks of yesterday, and left them fair and\r\neven, except where the subsiding water had left behind it the traces of\r\ndimpled pools and little running streams.\r\n\r\nRefreshed, delighted, invigorated, I walked along, forgetting all my\r\ncares, feeling as if I had wings to my feet, and could go at least\r\nforty miles without fatigue, and experiencing a sense of exhilaration\r\nto which I had been an entire stranger since the days of early youth.\r\nAbout half-past six, however, the grooms began to come down to air\r\ntheir masters\xe2\x80\x99 horses\xe2\x80\x94first one, and then another, till there were some\r\ndozen horses and five or six riders: but that need not trouble me, for\r\nthey would not come as far as the low rocks which I was now\r\napproaching. When I had reached these, and walked over the moist,\r\nslippery sea-weed (at the risk of floundering into one of the numerous\r\npools of clear, salt water that lay between them), to a little mossy\r\npromontory with the sea splashing round it, I looked back again to see\r\nwho next was stirring. Still, there were only the early grooms with\r\ntheir horses, and one gentleman with a little dark speck of a dog\r\nrunning before him, and one water-cart coming out of the town to get\r\nwater for the baths. In another minute or two, the distant bathing\r\nmachines would begin to move, and then the elderly gentlemen of regular\r\nhabits and sober quaker ladies would be coming to take their salutary\r\nmorning walks. But however interesting such a scene might be, I could\r\nnot wait to witness it, for the sun and the sea so dazzled my eyes in\r\nthat direction, that I could but afford one glance; and then I turned\r\nagain to delight myself with the sight and the sound of the sea,\r\ndashing against my promontory\xe2\x80\x94with no prodigious force, for the swell\r\nwas broken by the tangled sea-weed and the unseen rocks beneath;\r\notherwise I should soon have been deluged with spray. But the tide was\r\ncoming in; the water was rising; the gulfs and lakes were filling; the\r\nstraits were widening: it was time to seek some safer footing; so I\r\nwalked, skipped, and stumbled back to the smooth, wide sands, and\r\nresolved to proceed to a certain bold projection in the cliffs, and\r\nthen return.\r\n\r\nPresently, I heard a snuffling sound behind me and then a dog came\r\nfrisking and wriggling to my feet. It was my own Snap\xe2\x80\x94the little dark,\r\nwire-haired terrier! When I spoke his name, he leapt up in my face and\r\nyelled for joy. Almost as much delighted as himself, I caught the\r\nlittle creature in my arms, and kissed him repeatedly. But how came he\r\nto be there? He could not have dropped from the sky, or come all that\r\nway alone: it must be either his master, the rat-catcher, or somebody\r\nelse that had brought him; so, repressing my extravagant caresses, and\r\nendeavouring to repress his likewise, I looked round, and beheld\xe2\x80\x94Mr.\r\nWeston!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour dog remembers you well, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, warmly grasping the\r\nhand I offered him without clearly knowing what I was about. \xe2\x80\x9cYou rise\r\nearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot often so early as this,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, with amazing composure,\r\nconsidering all the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow far do you purpose to extend your walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of returning\xe2\x80\x94it must be almost time, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe consulted his watch\xe2\x80\x94a gold one now\xe2\x80\x94and told me it was only five\r\nminutes past seven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, doubtless, you have had a long enough walk,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning\r\ntowards the town, to which I now proceeded leisurely to retrace my\r\nsteps; and he walked beside me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what part of the town do you live?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he. \xe2\x80\x9cI never could\r\ndiscover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever could discover? Had he endeavoured to do so then? I told him the\r\nplace of our abode. He asked how we prospered in our affairs. I told\r\nhim we were doing very well\xe2\x80\x94that we had had a considerable addition to\r\nour pupils after the Christmas vacation, and expected a still further\r\nincrease at the close of this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be an accomplished instructor,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is my mother,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cshe manages things so well, and is\r\nso active, and clever, and kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know your mother. Will you introduce me to her some\r\ntime, if I call?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, willingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you allow me the privilege of an old friend, of looking in\r\nupon you now and then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if\xe2\x80\x94I suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a very foolish answer, but the truth was, I considered that I\r\nhad no right to invite anyone to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house without her\r\nknowledge; and if I had said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, if my mother does not object,\xe2\x80\x9d it\r\nwould appear as if by his question I understood more than was expected;\r\nso, _supposing_ she would not, I added, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so:\xe2\x80\x9d but of course I\r\nshould have said something more sensible and more polite, if I had had\r\nmy wits about me. We continued our walk for a minute in silence; which,\r\nhowever, was shortly relieved (no small relief to me) by Mr. Weston\r\ncommenting upon the brightness of the morning and the beauty of the\r\nbay, and then upon the advantages A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 possessed over many other\r\nfashionable places of resort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t ask what brings me to A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nrich enough to come for my own pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you had left Horton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear, then, that I had got the living of F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nF\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 was a village about two miles distant from A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cwe live so completely out of the world, even here, that\r\nnews seldom reaches me through any quarter; except through the medium\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 _Gazette_. But I hope you like your new parish; and that I\r\nmay congratulate you on the acquisition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect to like my parish better a year or two hence, when I have\r\nworked certain reforms I have set my heart upon\xe2\x80\x94or, at least,\r\nprogressed some steps towards such an achievement. But you may\r\ncongratulate me now; for I find it very agreeable to _have_ a parish\r\nall to myself, with nobody to interfere with me\xe2\x80\x94to thwart my plans or\r\ncripple my exertions: and besides, I have a respectable house in a\r\nrather pleasant neighbourhood, and three hundred pounds a year; and, in\r\nfact, I have nothing but solitude to complain of, and nothing but a\r\ncompanion to wish for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked at me as he concluded: and the flash of his dark eyes seemed\r\nto set my face on fire; greatly to my own discomfiture, for to evince\r\nconfusion at such a juncture was intolerable. I made an effort,\r\ntherefore, to remedy the evil, and disclaim all personal application of\r\nthe remark by a hasty, ill-expressed reply, to the effect that, if he\r\nwaited till he was well known in the neighbourhood, he might have\r\nnumerous opportunities for supplying his want among the residents of\r\nF\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 and its vicinity, or the visitors of A\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, if he required so ample a\r\nchoice: not considering the compliment implied by such an assertion,\r\ntill his answer made me aware of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so presumptuous as to believe that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthough you\r\ntell it me; but if it were so, I am rather particular in my notions of\r\na companion for life, and perhaps I might not find one to suit me among\r\nthe ladies you mention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you require perfection, you never will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not\xe2\x80\x94I have no right to require it, as being so far from perfect\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by a water-cart lumbering past\r\nus, for we were now come to the busy part of the sands; and, for the\r\nnext eight or ten minutes, between carts and horses, and asses, and\r\nmen, there was little room for social intercourse, till we had turned\r\nour backs upon the sea, and begun to ascend the precipitous road\r\nleading into the town. Here my companion offered me his arm, which I\r\naccepted, though not with the intention of using it as a support.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t often come on to the sands, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have\r\nwalked there many times, both morning and evening, since I came, and\r\nnever seen you till now; and several times, in passing through the\r\ntown, too, I have looked about for your school\xe2\x80\x94but I did not think of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 Road; and once or twice I made inquiries, but without obtaining\r\nthe requisite information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we had surmounted the acclivity, I was about to withdraw my arm\r\nfrom his, but by a slight tightening of the elbow was tacitly informed\r\nthat such was not his will, and accordingly desisted. Discoursing on\r\ndifferent subjects, we entered the town, and passed through several\r\nstreets. I saw that he was going out of his way to accompany me,\r\nnotwithstanding the long walk that was yet before him; and, fearing\r\nthat he might be inconveniencing himself from motives of politeness, I\r\nobserved\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI fear I am taking you out of your way, Mr. Weston\xe2\x80\x94I believe\r\nthe road to F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 lies quite in another direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you at the end of the next street,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when will you come to see mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow\xe2\x80\x94God willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe end of the next street was nearly the conclusion of my journey. He\r\nstopped there, however, bid me good-morning, and called Snap, who\r\nseemed a little doubtful whether to follow his old mistress or his new\r\nmaster, but trotted away upon being summoned by the latter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t offer to restore him to you, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Weston,\r\nsmiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied I, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that he has a good master; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite satisfied.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take it for granted that I am a good one, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man and the dog departed, and I returned home, full of gratitude to\r\nheaven for so much bliss, and praying that my hopes might not again be\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Agnes, you must not take such long walks again before\r\nbreakfast,\xe2\x80\x9d said my mother, observing that I drank an extra cup of\r\ncoffee and ate nothing\xe2\x80\x94pleading the heat of the weather, and the\r\nfatigue of my long walk as an excuse. I certainly did feel feverish and\r\ntired too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always do things by extremes: now, if you had taken a _short_ walk\r\nevery morning, and would continue to do so, it would do you good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, mamma, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is worse than lying in bed or bending over your books: you\r\nhave quite put yourself into a fever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nI was racking my brains with thinking how to tell her about Mr. Weston,\r\nfor she must know he was coming to-morrow. However, I waited till the\r\nbreakfast things were removed, and I was more calm and cool; and then,\r\nhaving sat down to my drawing, I began\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI met an old friend on the\r\nsands to-day, mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn old friend! Who could it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo old friends, indeed. One was a dog;\xe2\x80\x9d and then I reminded her of\r\nSnap, whose history I had recounted before, and related the incident of\r\nhis sudden appearance and remarkable recognition; \xe2\x80\x9cand the other,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncontinued I, \xe2\x80\x9cwas Mr. Weston, the curate of Horton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Weston! I never heard of him before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have: I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned him several times, I believe: but you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you speak of Mr. Hatfield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Hatfield was the rector, and Mr. Weston the curate: I used to\r\nmention him sometimes in contradistinction to Mr. Hatfield, as being a\r\nmore efficient clergyman. However, he was on the sands this morning\r\nwith the dog\xe2\x80\x94he had bought it, I suppose, from the rat-catcher; and he\r\nknew me as well as it did\xe2\x80\x94probably through its means: and I had a\r\nlittle conversation with him, in the course of which, as he asked about\r\nour school, I was led to say something about you, and your good\r\nmanagement; and he said he should like to know you, and asked if I\r\nwould introduce him to you, if he should take the liberty of calling\r\nto-morrow; so I said I would. Was I right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. What kind of a man is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very _respectable_ man, I think: but you will see him to-morrow. He\r\nis the new vicar of F\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, and as he has only been there a few weeks, I\r\nsuppose he has made no friends yet, and wants a little society.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe morrow came. What a fever of anxiety and expectation I was in from\r\nbreakfast till noon\xe2\x80\x94at which time he made his appearance! Having\r\nintroduced him to my mother, I took my work to the window, and sat down\r\nto await the result of the interview. They got on extremely well\r\ntogether\xe2\x80\x94greatly to my satisfaction, for I had felt very anxious about\r\nwhat my mother would think of him. He did not stay long that time: but\r\nwhen he rose to take leave, she said she should be happy to see him,\r\nwhenever he might find it convenient to call again; and when he was\r\ngone, I was gratified by hearing her say,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a very\r\nsensible man. But why did you sit back there, Agnes,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\ntalk so little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you talked so well, mamma, I thought you required no\r\nassistance from me: and, besides, he was your visitor, not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that, he often called upon us\xe2\x80\x94several times in the course of a\r\nweek. He generally addressed most of his conversation to my mother: and\r\nno wonder, for she could converse. I almost envied the unfettered,\r\nvigorous fluency of her discourse, and the strong sense evinced by\r\neverything she said\xe2\x80\x94and yet, I did not; for, though I occasionally\r\nregretted my own deficiencies for his sake, it gave me very great\r\npleasure to sit and hear the two beings I loved and honoured above\r\nevery one else in the world, discoursing together so amicably, so\r\nwisely, and so well. I was not always silent, however; nor was I at all\r\nneglected. I was quite as much noticed as I would wish to be: there was\r\nno lack of kind words and kinder looks, no end of delicate attentions,\r\ntoo fine and subtle to be grasped by words, and therefore\r\nindescribable\xe2\x80\x94but deeply felt at heart.\r\n\r\nCeremony was quickly dropped between us: Mr. Weston came as an expected\r\nguest, welcome at all times, and never deranging the economy of our\r\nhousehold affairs. He even called me \xe2\x80\x9cAgnes:\xe2\x80\x9d the name had been timidly\r\nspoken at first, but, finding it gave no offence in any quarter, he\r\nseemed greatly to prefer that appellation to \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Grey;\xe2\x80\x9d and so did I.\r\nHow tedious and gloomy were those days in which he did not come! And\r\nyet not miserable; for I had still the remembrance of the last visit\r\nand the hope of the next to cheer me. But when two or three days passed\r\nwithout my seeing him, I certainly felt very anxious\xe2\x80\x94absurdly,\r\nunreasonably so; for, of course, he had his own business and the\r\naffairs of his parish to attend to. And I dreaded the close of the\r\nholidays, when _my_ business also would begin, and I should be\r\nsometimes unable to see him, and sometimes\xe2\x80\x94when my mother was in the\r\nschoolroom\xe2\x80\x94obliged to be with him alone: a position I did not at all\r\ndesire, in the house; though to meet him out of doors, and walk beside\r\nhim, had proved by no means disagreeable.\r\n\r\nOne evening, however, in the last week of the vacation, he\r\narrived\xe2\x80\x94unexpectedly: for a heavy and protracted thunder-shower during\r\nthe afternoon had almost destroyed my hopes of seeing him that day; but\r\nnow the storm was over, and the sun was shining brightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA beautiful evening, Mrs. Grey!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as he entered. \xe2\x80\x9cAgnes, I\r\nwant you to take a walk with me to \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d (he named a certain part of the\r\ncoast\xe2\x80\x94a bold hill on the land side, and towards the sea a steep\r\nprecipice, from the summit of which a glorious view is to be had). \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nrain has laid the dust, and cooled and cleared the air, and the\r\nprospect will be magnificent. Will you come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I go, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went to get ready, and was down again in a few minutes; though, of\r\ncourse, I took a little more pains with my attire than if I had merely\r\nbeen going out on some shopping expedition alone. The thunder-shower\r\nhad certainly had a most beneficial effect upon the weather, and the\r\nevening was most delightful. Mr. Weston would have me to take his arm;\r\nhe said little during our passage through the crowded streets, but\r\nwalked very fast, and appeared grave and abstracted. I wondered what\r\nwas the matter, and felt an indefinite dread that something unpleasant\r\nwas on his mind; and vague surmises, concerning what it might be,\r\ntroubled me not a little, and made me grave and silent enough. But\r\nthese fantasies vanished upon reaching the quiet outskirts of the town;\r\nfor as soon as we came within sight of the venerable old church, and\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 hill, with the deep blue beyond it, I found my companion was\r\ncheerful enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99ve been walking too fast for you, Agnes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he: \xe2\x80\x9cin my\r\nimpatience to be rid of the town, I forgot to consult your convenience;\r\nbut now we\xe2\x80\x99ll walk as slowly as you please. I see, by those light\r\nclouds in the west, there will be a brilliant sunset, and we shall be\r\nin time to witness its effect upon the sea, at the most moderate rate\r\nof progression.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we had got about half-way up the hill, we fell into silence again;\r\nwhich, as usual, he was the first to break.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy house is desolate yet, Miss Grey,\xe2\x80\x9d he smilingly observed, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am\r\nacquainted now with all the ladies in my parish, and several in this\r\ntown too; and many others I know by sight and by report; but not one of\r\nthem will suit me for a companion; in fact, there is only one person in\r\nthe world that will: and that is yourself; and I want to know your\r\ndecision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in earnest, Mr. Weston?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn earnest! How could you think I should jest on such a subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on mine, that rested on his arm: he must have felt it\r\ntremble\xe2\x80\x94but it was no great matter now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I have not been too precipitate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a serious tone.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have known that it was not my way to flatter and talk soft\r\nnonsense, or even to speak the admiration that I felt; and that a\r\nsingle word or glance of mine meant more than the honied phrases and\r\nfervent protestations of most other men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said something about not liking to leave my mother, and doing nothing\r\nwithout her consent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI settled everything with Mrs. Grey, while you were putting on your\r\nbonnet,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said I might have her consent, if I could\r\nobtain yours; and I asked her, in case I should be so happy, to come\r\nand live with us\xe2\x80\x94for I was sure you would like it better. But she\r\nrefused, saying she could now afford to employ an assistant, and would\r\ncontinue the school till she could purchase an annuity sufficient to\r\nmaintain her in comfortable lodgings; and, meantime, she would spend\r\nher vacations alternately with us and your sister, and should be quite\r\ncontented if you were happy. And so now I have overruled your\r\nobjections on her account. Have you any other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou love me then?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, fervently pressing my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I pause. My Diary, from which I have compiled these pages, goes\r\nbut little further. I could go on for years, but I will content myself\r\nwith adding, that I shall never forget that glorious summer evening,\r\nand always remember with delight that steep hill, and the edge of the\r\nprecipice where we stood together, watching the splendid sunset\r\nmirrored in the restless world of waters at our feet\xe2\x80\x94with hearts filled\r\nwith gratitude to heaven, and happiness, and love\xe2\x80\x94almost too full for\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after that, when my mother had supplied herself with an\r\nassistant, I became the wife of Edward Weston; and never have found\r\ncause to repent it, and am certain that I never shall. We have had\r\ntrials, and we know that we must have them again; but we bear them well\r\ntogether, and endeavour to fortify ourselves and each other against the\r\nfinal separation\xe2\x80\x94that greatest of all afflictions to the survivor. But,\r\nif we keep in mind the glorious heaven beyond, where both may meet\r\nagain, and sin and sorrow are unknown, surely that too may be borne;\r\nand, meantime, we endeavour to live to the glory of Him who has\r\nscattered so many blessings in our path.\r\n\r\nEdward, by his strenuous exertions, has worked surprising reforms in\r\nhis parish, and is esteemed and loved by its inhabitants\xe2\x80\x94as he\r\ndeserves; for whatever his faults may be as a man (and no one is\r\nentirely without), I defy anybody to blame him as a pastor, a husband,\r\nor a father.\r\n\r\nOur children, Edward, Agnes, and little Mary, promise well; their\r\neducation, for the time being, is chiefly committed to me; and they\r\nshall want no good thing that a mother\xe2\x80\x99s care can give. Our modest\r\nincome is amply sufficient for our requirements: and by practising the\r\neconomy we learnt in harder times, and never attempting to imitate our\r\nricher neighbours, we manage not only to enjoy comfort and contentment\r\nourselves, but to have every year something to lay by for our children,\r\nand something to give to those who need it.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think I have said sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spottiswode & Co.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\'s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
