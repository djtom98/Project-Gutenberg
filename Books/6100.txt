From the tip of her wing-trimmed hat to the toe\r\nof her low-heeled shoe she radiated health, capability, and alert\r\ndecision. Even her voice, as she greeted the maid that opened the\r\ndoor, vibrated with the joy of living.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Mary. Is my sister in?"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes, ma\'am, Mrs. Carew is in," hesitated the girl; "but--she gave\r\norders she\'d see no one."\r\n\r\n"Did she? Well, I\'m no one," smiled Miss Wetherby, "so she\'ll see me.\r\nDon\'t worry--I\'ll take the blame," she nodded, in answer to the\r\nfrightened remonstrance in the girl\'s eyes. "Where is she--in her\r\nsitting-room?"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes, ma\'am; but--that is, she said--" Miss Wetherby, however, was\r\nalready halfway up the broad stairway; and, with a despairing backward\r\nglance, the maid turned away.\r\n\r\nIn the hall above Della Wetherby unhesitatingly walked toward a\r\nhalf-open door, and knocked.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mary," answered a "dear-me-what-now" voice. "Haven\'t I--Oh,\r\nDella!" The voice grew suddenly warm with love and surprise. "You dear\r\ngirl, where did you come from?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s Della," smiled that young woman, blithely, already halfway\r\nacross the room. "I\'ve come from an over-Sunday at the beach with two\r\nof the other nurses, and I\'m on my way back to the Sanatorium now.\r\nThat is, I\'m here now, but I sha\'n\'t be long. I stepped in for--this,"\r\nshe finished, giving the owner of the "dear-me-what-now" voice a\r\nhearty kiss.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew frowned and drew back a little coldly. The slight touch of\r\njoy and animation that had come into her face fled, leaving only a\r\ndispirited fretfulness that was plainly very much at home there.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course! I might have known," she said. "You never stay--here."\r\n\r\n"Here!" Della Wetherby laughed merrily, and threw up her hands; then,\r\nabruptly, her voice and manner changed. She regarded her sister with\r\ngrave, tender eyes. "Ruth, dear, I couldn\'t--I just couldn\'t live in\r\nthis house. You know I couldn\'t," she finished gently.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew stirred irritably.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t see why not," she fenced.\r\n\r\nDella Wetherby shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you do, dear. You know I\'m entirely out of sympathy with it all:\r\nthe gloom, the lack of aim, the insistence on misery and bitterness."\r\n\r\n"But I AM miserable and bitter."\r\n\r\n"You ought not to be."\r\n\r\n"Why not? What have I to make me otherwise?"\r\n\r\nDella Wetherby gave an impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n"Ruth, look here," she challenged. "You\'re thirty-three years old. You\r\nhave good health--or would have, if you treated yourself properly--and\r\nyou certainly have an abundance of time and a superabundance of money.\r\nSurely anybody would say you ought to find SOMETHING to do this\r\nglorious morning besides sitting moped up in this tomb-like house with\r\ninstructions to the maid that you\'ll see no one."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t WANT to see anybody."\r\n\r\n"Then I\'d MAKE myself want to."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew sighed wearily and turned away her head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Della, why won\'t you ever understand? I\'m not like you. I\r\ncan\'t--forget."\r\n\r\nA swift pain crossed the younger woman\'s face.\r\n\r\n"You mean--Jamie, I suppose. I don\'t forget--that, dear. I couldn\'t,\r\nof course. But moping won\'t help us--find him."\r\n\r\n"As if I hadn\'t TRIED to find him, for eight long years--and by\r\nsomething besides moping," flashed Mrs. Carew, indignantly, with a sob\r\nin her voice.\r\n\r\n"Of course you have, dear," soothed the other, quickly; "and we shall\r\nkeep on hunting, both of us, till we do find him--or die. But THIS\r\nsort of thing doesn\'t help."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t want to do--anything else," murmured Ruth Carew,\r\ndrearily.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was silence. The younger woman sat regarding her\r\nsister with troubled, disapproving eyes.\r\n\r\n"Ruth," she said, at last, with a touch of exasperation, "forgive me,\r\nbut--are you always going to be like this? You\'re widowed, I\'ll admit;\r\nbut your married life lasted only a year, and your husband was much\r\nolder than yourself. You were little more than a child at the time,\r\nand that one short year can\'t seem much more than a dream now. Surely\r\nthat ought not to embitter your whole life!"\r\n\r\n"No, oh, no," murmured Mrs. Carew, still drearily.\r\n\r\n"Then ARE you going to be always like this?"\r\n\r\n"Well, of course, if I could find Jamie--"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, I know; but, Ruth, dear, isn\'t there anything in the world\r\nbut Jamie--to make you ANY happy?"\r\n\r\n"There doesn\'t seem to be, that I can think of," sighed Mrs. Carew,\r\nindifferently.\r\n\r\n"Ruth!" ejaculated her sister, stung into something very like anger.\r\nThen suddenly she laughed. "Oh, Ruth, Ruth, I\'d like to give you a\r\ndose of Pollyanna. I don\'t know any one who needs it more!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew stiffened a little.\r\n\r\n"Well, what pollyanna may be I don\'t know, but whatever it is, I don\'t\r\nwant it," she retorted sharply, nettled in her turn. "This isn\'t your\r\nbeloved Sanatorium, and I\'m not your patient to be dosed and bossed,\r\nplease remember."\r\n\r\nDella Wetherby\'s eyes danced, but her lips remained unsmiling.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna isn\'t a medicine, my dear," she said demurely, "--though I\r\nhave heard some people call her a tonic. Pollyanna is a little girl."\r\n\r\n"A child? Well, how should I know," retorted the other, still\r\naggrievedly. "You have your \'belladonna,\' so I\'m sure I don\'t see why\r\nnot \'pollyanna.\' Besides, you\'re always recommending something for me\r\nto take, and you distinctly said \'dose\'--and dose usually means\r\nmedicine, of a sort."\r\n\r\n"Well, Pollyanna IS a medicine--of a sort," smiled Della. "Anyway, the\r\nSanatorium doctors all declare that she\'s better than any medicine\r\nthey can give. She\'s a little girl, Ruth, twelve or thirteen years\r\nold, who was at the Sanatorium all last summer and most of the winter.\r\nI didn\'t see her but a month or two, for she left soon after I\r\narrived. But that was long enough for me to come fully under her\r\nspell. Besides, the whole Sanatorium is still talking Pollyanna, and\r\nplaying her game."\r\n\r\n"GAME!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," nodded Della, with a curious smile. "Her \'glad game.\' I\'ll\r\nnever forget my first introduction to it. One feature of her treatment\r\nwas particularly disagreeable and even painful. It came every Tuesday\r\nmorning, and very soon after my arrival it fell to my lot to give it\r\nto her. I was dreading it, for I knew from past experience with other\r\nchildren what to expect: fretfulness and tears, if nothing worse. To\r\nmy unbounded amazement she greeted me with a smile and said she was\r\nglad to see me; and, if you\'ll believe it, there was never so much as\r\na whimper from her lips through the whole ordeal, though I knew I was\r\nhurting her cruelly.\r\n\r\n"I fancy I must have said something that showed my surprise, for she\r\nexplained earnestly: \'Oh, yes, I used to feel that way, too, and I did\r\ndread it so, till I happened to think \'twas just like Nancy\'s\r\nwash-days, and I could be gladdest of all on TUESDAYS, \'cause there\r\nwouldn\'t be another one for a whole week.\'"\r\n\r\n"Why, how extraordinary!" frowned Mrs. Carew, not quite comprehending.\r\n"But, I\'m sure I don\'t see any GAME to that."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t, till later. Then she told me. It seems she was the\r\nmotherless daughter of a poor minister in the West, and was brought up\r\nby the Ladies\' Aid Society and missionary barrels. When she was a tiny\r\ngirl she wanted a doll, and confidently expected it in the next\r\nbarrel; but there turned out to be nothing but a pair of little\r\ncrutches.\r\n\r\n"The child cried, of course, and it was then that her father taught\r\nher the game of hunting for something to be glad about, in everything\r\nthat happened; and he said she could begin right then by being glad\r\nshe didn\'t NEED the crutches. That was the beginning. Pollyanna said\r\nit was a lovely game, and she\'d been playing it ever since; and that\r\nthe harder it was to find the glad part, the more fun it was, only\r\nwhen it was too AWFUL hard, like she had found it sometimes."\r\n\r\n"Why, how extraordinary!" murmured Mrs. Carew, still not entirely\r\ncomprehending.\r\n\r\n"You\'d think so--if you could see the results of that game in the\r\nSanatorium," nodded Della; "and Dr. Ames says he hears she\'s\r\nrevolutionized the whole town where she came from, just the same way.\r\nHe knows Dr. Chilton very well--the man that married Pollyanna\'s aunt.\r\nAnd, by the way, I believe that marriage was one of her ministrations.\r\nShe patched up an old lovers\' quarrel between them.\r\n\r\n"You see, two years ago, or more, Pollyanna\'s father died, and the\r\nlittle girl was sent East to this aunt. In October she was hurt by an\r\nautomobile, and was told she could never walk again. In April Dr.\r\nChilton sent her to the Sanatorium, and she was there till last\r\nMarch--almost a year. She went home practically cured. You should have\r\nseen the child! There was just one cloud to mar her happiness: that\r\nshe couldn\'t WALK all the way there. As near as I can gather, the\r\nwhole town turned out to meet her with brass bands and banners.\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t TELL about Pollyanna. One has to SEE her. And that\'s\r\nwhy I say I wish you could have a dose of Pollyanna. It would do you a\r\nworld of good."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew lifted her chin a little.\r\n\r\n"Really, indeed, I must say I beg to differ with you," she returned\r\ncoldly. "I don\'t care to be \'revolutionized,\' and I have no lovers\'\r\nquarrel to be patched up; and if there is ANYTHING that would be\r\ninsufferable to me, it would be a little Miss Prim with a long face\r\npreaching to me how much I had to be thankful for. I never could\r\nbear--" But a ringing laugh interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Ruth, Ruth," choked her sister, gleefully. "Miss Prim,\r\nindeed--POLLYANNA! Oh, oh, if only you could see that child now! But\r\nthere, I might have known. I SAID one couldn\'t TELL about Pollyanna.\r\nAnd of course you won\'t be apt to see her. But--Miss Prim, indeed!"\r\nAnd off she went into another gale of laughter. Almost at once,\r\nhowever, she sobered and gazed at her sister with the old troubled\r\nlook in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Seriously, dear, can\'t anything be done?" she pleaded. "You ought not\r\nto waste your life like this. Won\'t you try to get out a little more,\r\nand--meet people?"\r\n\r\n"Why should I, when I don\'t want to? I\'m tired of--people. You know\r\nsociety always bored me."\r\n\r\n"Then why not try some sort of work--charity?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew gave an impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n"Della, dear, we\'ve been all over this before. I do give money--lots\r\nof it, and that\'s enough. In fact, I\'m not sure but it\'s too much. I\r\ndon\'t believe in pauperizing people."\r\n\r\n"But if you\'d give a little of yourself, dear," ventured Della,\r\ngently. "If you could only get interested in something outside of your\r\nown life, it would help so much; and--"\r\n\r\n"Now, Della, dear," interrupted the elder sister, restively, "I love\r\nyou, and I love to have you come here; but I simply cannot endure\r\nbeing preached to. It\'s all very well for you to turn yourself into an\r\nangel of mercy and give cups of cold water, and bandage up broken\r\nheads, and all that. Perhaps YOU can forget Jamie that way; but I\r\ncouldn\'t. It would only make me think of him all the more, wondering\r\nif HE had any one to give him water and bandage up his head. Besides,\r\nthe whole thing would be very distasteful to me--mixing with all sorts\r\nand kinds of people like that."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever try it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no, of course not!" Mrs. Carew\'s voice was scornfully indignant.\r\n\r\n"Then how can you know--till you do try?" asked the young nurse,\r\nrising to her feet a little wearily. "But I must go, dear. I\'m to meet\r\nthe girls at the South Station. Our train goes at twelve-thirty. I\'m\r\nsorry if I\'ve made you cross with me," she finished, as she kissed her\r\nsister good-by.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not cross with you, Della," sighed Mrs. Carew; "but if you only\r\nwould understand!"\r\n\r\nOne minute later Della Wetherby made her way through the silent,\r\ngloomy halls, and out to the street. Face, step, and manner were very\r\ndifferent from what they had been when she tripped up the steps less\r\nthan half an hour before. All the alertness, the springiness, the joy\r\nof living were gone. For half a block she listlessly dragged one foot\r\nafter the other. Then, suddenly, she threw back her head and drew a\r\nlong breath.\r\n\r\n"One week in that house would kill me," she shuddered. "I don\'t\r\nbelieve even Pollyanna herself could so much as make a dent in the\r\ngloom! And the only thing she could be glad for there would be that\r\nshe didn\'t have to stay."\r\n\r\nThat this avowed disbelief in Pollyanna\'s ability to bring about a\r\nchange for the better in Mrs. Carew\'s home was not Della Wetherby\'s\r\nreal opinion, however, was quickly proved; for no sooner had the nurse\r\nreached the Sanatorium than she learned something that sent her flying\r\nback over the fifty-mile journey to Boston the very next day.\r\n\r\nSo exactly as before did she find circumstances at her sister\'s home\r\nthat it seemed almost as if Mrs. Carew had not moved since she left\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Ruth," she burst out eagerly, after answering her sister\'s surprised\r\ngreeting, "I just HAD to come, and you must, this once, yield to me\r\nand let me have my way. Listen! You can have that little Pollyanna\r\nhere, I think, if you will."\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t," returned Mrs. Carew, with chilly promptness.\r\n\r\nDella Wetherby did not seem to have heard. She plunged on excitedly.\r\n\r\n"When I got back yesterday I found that Dr. Ames had had a letter from\r\nDr. Chilton, the one who married Pollyanna\'s aunt, you know. Well, it\r\nseems in it he said he was going to Germany for the winter for a\r\nspecial course, and was going to take his wife with him, if he could\r\npersuade her that Pollyanna would be all right in some boarding school\r\nhere meantime. But Mrs. Chilton didn\'t want to leave Pollyanna in just\r\na school, and so he was afraid she wouldn\'t go. And now, Ruth, there\'s\r\nour chance. I want YOU to take Pollyanna this winter, and let her go\r\nto some school around here."\r\n\r\n"What an absurd idea, Della! As if I wanted a child here to bother\r\nwith!"\r\n\r\n"She won\'t bother a bit. She must be nearly or quite thirteen by this\r\ntime, and she\'s the most capable little thing you ever saw."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like \'capable\' children," retorted Mrs. Carew perversely--but\r\nshe laughed; and because she did laugh, her sister took sudden courage\r\nand redoubled her efforts.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the suddenness of the appeal, or the novelty of it.\r\nPerhaps it was because the story of Pollyanna had somehow touched Ruth\r\nCarew\'s heart. Perhaps it was only her unwillingness to refuse her\r\nsister\'s impassioned plea. Whatever it was that finally turned the\r\nscale, when Della Wetherby took her hurried leave half an hour later,\r\nshe carried with her Ruth Carew\'s promise to receive Pollyanna into\r\nher home.\r\n\r\n"But just remember," Mrs. Carew warned her at parting, "just remember\r\nthat the minute that child begins to preach to me and to tell me to\r\ncount my mercies, back she goes to you, and you may do what you please\r\nwith her. _I_ sha\'n\'t keep her!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll remember--but I\'m not worrying any," nodded the younger woman,\r\nin farewell. To herself she whispered, as she hurried away from the\r\nhouse: "Half my job is done. Now for the other half--to get Pollyanna\r\nto come. But she\'s just got to come. I\'ll write that letter so they\r\ncan\'t help letting her come!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSOME OLD FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Beldingsville that August day, Mrs. Chilton waited until Pollyanna\r\nhad gone to bed before she spoke to her husband about the letter that\r\nhad come in the morning mail. For that matter, she would have had to\r\nwait, anyway, for crowded office hours, and the doctor\'s two long\r\ndrives over the hills had left no time for domestic conferences.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-past nine, indeed, when the doctor entered his\r\nwife\'s sitting-room. His tired face lighted at sight of her, but at\r\nonce a perplexed questioning came to his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why, Polly, dear, what is it?" he asked concernedly.\r\n\r\nHis wife gave a rueful laugh.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a letter--though I didn\'t mean you should find out by just\r\nlooking at me."\r\n\r\n"Then you mustn\'t look so I can," he smiled. "But what is it?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton hesitated, pursed her lips, then picked up a letter near\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll read it to you," she said. "It\'s from a Miss Della Wetherby at\r\nDr. Ames\' Sanatorium."\r\n\r\n"All right. Fire away," directed the man, throwing himself at full\r\nlength on to the couch near his wife\'s chair.\r\n\r\nBut his wife did not at once "fire away." She got up first and covered\r\nher husband\'s recumbent figure with a gray worsted afghan. Mrs.\r\nChilton\'s wedding day was but a year behind her. She was forty-two\r\nnow. It seemed sometimes as if into that one short year of wifehood\r\nshe had tried to crowd all the loving service and "babying" that had\r\nbeen accumulating through twenty years of lovelessness and loneliness.\r\nNor did the doctor--who had been forty-five on his wedding day, and\r\nwho could remember nothing but loneliness and lovelessness--on his\r\npart object in the least to this concentrated "tending." He acted,\r\nindeed, as if he quite enjoyed it--though he was careful not to show\r\nit too ardently: he had discovered that Mrs. Polly had for so long\r\nbeen Miss Polly that she was inclined to retreat in a panic and dub\r\nher ministrations "silly," if they were received with too much notice\r\nand eagerness. So he contented himself now with a mere pat of her hand\r\nas she gave the afghan a final smooth, and settled herself to read the\r\nletter aloud.\r\n\r\n"My dear Mrs. Chilton," Della Wetherby had written. "Just six times I\r\nhave commenced a letter to you, and torn it up; so now I have decided\r\nnot to \'commence\' at all, but just to tell you what I want at once. I\r\nwant Pollyanna. May I have her?\r\n\r\n"I met you and your husband last March when you came on to take\r\nPollyanna home, but I presume you don\'t remember me. I am asking Dr.\r\nAmes (who does know me very well) to write your husband, so that you\r\nmay (I hope) not fear to trust your dear little niece to us.\r\n\r\n"I understand that you would go to Germany with your husband but for\r\nleaving Pollyanna; and so I am making so bold as to ask you to let us\r\ntake her. Indeed, I am begging you to let us have her, dear Mrs.\r\nChilton. And now let me tell you why.\r\n\r\n"My sister, Mrs. Carew, is a lonely, broken-hearted, discontented,\r\nunhappy woman. She lives in a world of gloom, into which no sunshine\r\npenetrates. Now I believe that if anything on earth can bring the\r\nsunshine into her life, it is your niece, Pollyanna. Won\'t you let her\r\ntry? I wish I could tell you what she has done for the Sanatorium\r\nhere, but nobody could TELL. You would have to see it. I long ago\r\ndiscovered that you can\'t TELL about Pollyanna. The minute you try to,\r\nshe sounds priggish and preachy, and--impossible. Yet you and I know\r\nshe is anything but that. You just have to bring Pollyanna on to the\r\nscene and let her speak for herself. And so I want to take her to my\r\nsister--and let her speak for herself. She would attend school, of\r\ncourse, but meanwhile I truly believe she would be healing the wound\r\nin my sister\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know how to end this letter. I believe it\'s harder than it\r\nwas to begin it. I\'m afraid I don\'t want to end it at all. I just want\r\nto keep talking and talking, for fear, if I stop, it\'ll give you a\r\nchance to say no. And so, if you ARE tempted to say that dreadful\r\nword, won\'t you please consider that--that I\'m still talking, and\r\ntelling you how much we want and need Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n                                    "Hopefully yours,\r\n\r\n                                    "DELLA WETHERBY."\r\n\r\n"There!" ejaculated Mrs. Chilton, as she laid the letter down. "Did\r\nyou ever read such a remarkable letter, or hear of a more\r\npreposterous, absurd request?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not so sure," smiled the doctor. "I don\'t think it\'s absurd\r\nto want Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"But--but the way she puts it--healing the wound in her sister\'s\r\nheart, and all that. One would think the child was some sort of--of\r\nmedicine!"\r\n\r\nThe doctor laughed outright, and raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not so sure but she is, Polly. I ALWAYS said I wished I\r\ncould prescribe her and buy her as I would a box of pills; and Charlie\r\nAmes says they always made it a point at the Sanatorium to give their\r\npatients a dose of Pollyanna as soon as possible after their arrival,\r\nduring the whole year she was there."\r\n\r\n"\'Dose,\' indeed!" scorned Mrs. Chilton.\r\n\r\n"Then--you don\'t think you\'ll let her go?"\r\n\r\n"Go? Why, of course not! Do you think I\'d let that child go to perfect\r\nstrangers like that?--and such strangers! Why, Thomas, I should expect\r\nthat that nurse would have her all bottled and labeled with full\r\ndirections on the outside how to take her, by the time I\'d got back\r\nfrom Germany."\r\n\r\nAgain the doctor threw back his head and laughed heartily, but only\r\nfor a moment. His face changed perceptibly as he reached into his\r\npocket for a letter.\r\n\r\n"I heard from Dr. Ames myself, this morning," he said, with an odd\r\nsomething in his voice that brought a puzzled frown to his wife\'s\r\nbrow. "Suppose I read you my letter now."\r\n\r\n"Dear Tom," he began. "Miss Della Wetherby has asked me to give her\r\nand her sister a \'character,\' which I am very glad to do. I have known\r\nthe Wetherby girls from babyhood. They come from a fine old family,\r\nand are thoroughbred gentlewomen. You need not fear on that score.\r\n\r\n"There were three sisters, Doris, Ruth, and Della. Doris married a man\r\nnamed John Kent, much against the family\'s wishes. Kent came from good\r\nstock, but was not much himself, I guess, and was certainly a very\r\neccentric, disagreeable man to deal with. He was bitterly angry at the\r\nWetherbys\' attitude toward him, and there was little communication\r\nbetween the families until the baby came. The Wetherbys worshiped the\r\nlittle boy, James--\'Jamie,\' as they called him. Doris, the mother,\r\ndied when the boy was four years old, and the Wetherbys were making\r\nevery effort to get the father to give the child entirely up to them,\r\nwhen suddenly Kent disappeared, taking the boy with him. He has never\r\nbeen heard from since, though a world-wide search has been made.\r\n\r\n"The loss practically killed old Mr. and Mrs. Wetherby. They both died\r\nsoon after. Ruth was already married and widowed. Her husband was a\r\nman named Carew, very wealthy, and much older than herself. He lived\r\nbut a year or so after marriage, and left her with a young son who\r\nalso died within a year.\r\n\r\n"From the time little Jamie disappeared, Ruth and Della seemed to have\r\nbut one object in life, and that was to find him. They have spent\r\nmoney like water, and have all but moved heaven and earth; but without\r\navail. In time Della took up nursing. She is doing splendid work, and\r\nhas become the cheerful, efficient, sane woman that she was meant to\r\nbe--though still never forgetting her lost nephew, and never leaving\r\nunfollowed any possible clew that might lead to his discovery.\r\n\r\n"But with Mrs. Carew it is quite different. After losing her own boy,\r\nshe seemed to concentrate all her thwarted mother-love on her sister\'s\r\nson. As you can imagine, she was frantic when he disappeared. That was\r\neight years ago--for her, eight long years of misery, gloom, and\r\nbitterness. Everything that money can buy, of course, is at her\r\ncommand; but nothing pleases her, nothing interests her. Della feels\r\nthat the time has come when she must be gotten out of herself, at all\r\nhazards; and Della believes that your wife\'s sunny little niece,\r\nPollyanna, possesses the magic key that will unlock the door to a new\r\nexistence for her. Such being the case, I hope you will see your way\r\nclear to granting her request. And may I add that I, too, personally,\r\nwould appreciate the favor; for Ruth Carew and her sister are very\r\nold, dear friends of my wife and myself; and what touches them touches\r\nus. As ever yours, CHARLIE."\r\n\r\nThe letter finished, there was a long silence, so long a silence that\r\nthe doctor uttered a quiet, "Well, Polly?"\r\n\r\nStill there was silence. The doctor, watching his wife\'s face closely,\r\nsaw that the usually firm lips and chin were trembling. He waited then\r\nquietly until his wife spoke.\r\n\r\n"How soon--do you think--they\'ll expect her?" she asked at last.\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself Dr. Chilton gave a slight start.\r\n\r\n"You--mean--that you WILL let her go?" he cried.\r\n\r\nHis wife turned indignantly.\r\n\r\n"Why, Thomas Chilton, what a question! Do you suppose, after a letter\r\nlike that, I could do anything BUT let her go? Besides, didn\'t Dr.\r\nAmes HIMSELF ask us to? Do you think, after what that man has done for\r\nPollyanna, that I\'d refuse him ANYTHING--no matter what it was?"\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear! I hope, now, that the doctor won\'t take it into his head\r\nto ask for--for YOU, my love," murmured the husband-of-a-year, with a\r\nwhimsical smile. But his wife only gave him a deservedly scornful\r\nglance, and said:\r\n\r\n"You may write Dr. Ames that we\'ll send Pollyanna; and ask him to tell\r\nMiss Wetherby to give us full instructions. It must be sometime before\r\nthe tenth of next month, of course, for you sail then; and I want to\r\nsee the child properly established myself before I leave, naturally."\r\n\r\n"When will you tell Pollyanna?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow, probably."\r\n\r\n"What will you tell her?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know--exactly; but not any more than I can\'t help, certainly.\r\nWhatever happens, Thomas, we don\'t want to spoil Pollyanna; and no\r\nchild could help being spoiled if she once got it into her head that\r\nshe was a sort of--of--"\r\n\r\n"Of medicine bottle with a label of full instructions for taking?"\r\ninterpolated the doctor, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes," sighed Mrs. Chilton. "It\'s her unconsciousness that saves the\r\nwhole thing. YOU know that, dear."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," nodded the man.\r\n\r\n"She knows, of course, that you and I, and half the town are playing\r\nthe game with her, and that we--we are wonderfully happier because we\r\nARE playing it." Mrs. Chilton\'s voice shook a little, then went on\r\nmore steadily. "But if, consciously, she should begin to be anything\r\nbut her own natural, sunny, happy little self, playing the game that\r\nher father taught her, she would be--just what that nurse said she\r\nsounded like--\'impossible.\' So, whatever I tell her, I sha\'n\'t tell\r\nher that she\'s going down to Mrs. Carew\'s to cheer her up," concluded\r\nMrs. Chilton, rising to her feet with decision, and putting away her\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n"Which is where I think you\'re wise," approved the doctor.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was told the next day; and this was the manner of it.\r\n\r\n"My dear," began her aunt, when the two were alone together that\r\nmorning, "how would you like to spend next winter in Boston?"\r\n\r\n"With you?"\r\n\r\n"No; I have decided to go with your uncle to Germany. But Mrs. Carew,\r\na dear friend of Dr. Ames, has asked you to come and stay with her for\r\nthe winter, and I think I shall let you go."\r\n\r\nPollyanna\'s face fell.\r\n\r\n"But in Boston I won\'t have Jimmy, or Mr. Pendleton, or Mrs. Snow, or\r\nanybody that I know, Aunt Polly."\r\n\r\n"No, dear; but you didn\'t have them when you came here--till you found\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a sudden smile.\r\n\r\n"Why, Aunt Polly, so I didn\'t! And that means that down to Boston\r\nthere are some Jimmys and Mr. Pendletons and Mrs. Snows waiting for me\r\nthat I don\'t know, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear."\r\n\r\n"Then I can be glad of that. I believe now, Aunt Polly, you know how\r\nto play the game better than I do. I never thought of the folks down\r\nthere waiting for me to know them. And there\'s such a lot of \'em, too!\r\nI saw some of them when I was there two years ago with Mrs. Gray. We\r\nwere there two whole hours, you know, on my way here from out West.\r\n\r\n"There was a man in the station--a perfectly lovely man who told me\r\nwhere to get a drink of water. Do you suppose he\'s there now? I\'d like\r\nto know him. And there was a nice lady with a little girl. They live\r\nin Boston. They said they did. The little girl\'s name was Susie Smith.\r\nPerhaps I could get to know them. Do you suppose I could? And there\r\nwas a boy, and another lady with a baby--only they lived in Honolulu,\r\nso probably I couldn\'t find them there now. But there\'d be Mrs. Carew,\r\nanyway. Who is Mrs. Carew, Aunt Polly? Is she a relation?"\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Pollyanna!" exclaimed Mrs. Chilton, half-laughingly,\r\nhalf-despairingly. "How do you expect anybody to keep up with your\r\ntongue, much less your thoughts, when they skip to Honolulu and back\r\nagain in two seconds! No, Mrs. Carew isn\'t any relation to us. She\'s\r\nMiss Della Wetherby\'s sister. Do you remember Miss Wetherby at the\r\nSanatorium?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n"HER sister? Miss Wetherby\'s sister? Oh, then she\'ll be lovely, I\r\nknow. Miss Wetherby was. I loved Miss Wetherby. She had little\r\nsmile-wrinkles all around her eyes and mouth, and she knew the NICEST\r\nstories. I only had her two months, though, because she only got there\r\na little while before I came away. At first I was sorry that I hadn\'t\r\nhad her ALL the time, but afterwards I was glad; for you see if I HAD\r\nhad her all the time, it would have been harder to say good-by than\r\n\'twas when I\'d only had her a little while. And now it\'ll seem as if I\r\nhad her again, \'cause I\'m going to have her sister."\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton drew in her breath and bit her lip.\r\n\r\n"But, Pollyanna, dear, you must not expect that they\'ll be quite\r\nalike," she ventured.\r\n\r\n"Why, they\'re SISTERS, Aunt Polly," argued the little girl, her eyes\r\nwidening; "and I thought sisters were always alike. We had two sets of\r\n\'em in the Ladies\' Aiders. One set was twins, and THEY were so alike\r\nyou couldn\'t tell which was Mrs. Peck and which was Mrs. Jones, until\r\na wart grew on Mrs. Jones\'s nose, then of course we could, because we\r\nlooked for the wart the first thing. And that\'s what I told her one\r\nday when she was complaining that people called her Mrs. Peck, and I\r\nsaid if they\'d only look for the wart as I did, they\'d know right off.\r\nBut she acted real cross--I mean displeased, and I\'m afraid she didn\'t\r\nlike it--though I don\'t see why; for I should have thought she\'d been\r\nglad there was something they could be told apart by, \'specially as\r\nshe was the president, and didn\'t like it when folks didn\'t ACT as if\r\nshe was the president--best seats and introductions and special\r\nattentions at church suppers, you know. But she didn\'t, and afterwards\r\nI heard Mrs. White tell Mrs. Rawson that Mrs. Jones had done\r\neverything she could think of to get rid of that wart, even to trying\r\nto put salt on a bird\'s tail. But I don\'t see how THAT could do any\r\ngood. Aunt Polly, DOES putting salt on a bird\'s tail help the warts on\r\npeople\'s noses?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not, child! How you do run on, Pollyanna, especially if you\r\nget started on those Ladies\' Aiders!"\r\n\r\n"Do I, Aunt Polly?" asked the little girl, ruefully. "And does it\r\nplague you? I don\'t mean to plague you, honestly, Aunt Polly. And,\r\nanyway, if I do plague you about those Ladies\' Aiders, you can be kind\r\no\' glad, for if I\'m thinking of the Aiders, I\'m sure to be thinking\r\nhow glad I am that I don\'t belong to them any longer, but have got an\r\naunt all my own. You can be glad of that, can\'t you, Aunt Polly?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, dear, of course I can, of course I can," laughed Mrs.\r\nChilton, rising to leave the room, and feeling suddenly very guilty\r\nthat she was conscious sometimes of a little of her old irritation\r\nagainst Pollyanna\'s perpetual gladness.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days, while letters concerning Pollyanna\'s winter\r\nstay in Boston were flying back and forth, Pollyanna herself was\r\npreparing for that stay by a series of farewell visits to her\r\nBeldingsville friends.\r\n\r\nEverybody in the little Vermont village knew Pollyanna now, and almost\r\neverybody was playing the game with her. The few who were not, were\r\nnot refraining because of ignorance of what the glad game was. So to\r\none house after another Pollyanna carried the news now that she was\r\ngoing down to Boston to spend the winter; and loudly rose the clamor\r\nof regret and remonstrance, all the way from Nancy in Aunt Polly\'s own\r\nkitchen to the great house on the hill where lived John Pendleton.\r\n\r\nNancy did not hesitate to say--to every one except her mistress--that\r\nSHE considered this Boston trip all foolishness, and that for her part\r\nshe would have been glad to take Miss Pollyanna home with her to the\r\nCorners, she would, she would; and then Mrs. Polly could have gone to\r\nGermany all she wanted to.\r\n\r\nOn the hill John Pendleton said practically the same thing, only he\r\ndid not hesitate to say it to Mrs. Chilton herself. As for Jimmy, the\r\ntwelve-year-old boy whom John Pendleton had taken into his home\r\nbecause Pollyanna wanted him to, and whom he had now adopted--because\r\nhe wanted to himself--as for Jimmy, Jimmy was indignant, and he was\r\nnot slow to show it.\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve just come," he reproached Pollyanna, in the tone of voice\r\na small boy is apt to use when he wants to hide the fact that he has a\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'ve been here ever since the last of March. Besides, it isn\'t\r\nas if I was going to stay. It\'s only for this winter."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care. You\'ve just been away for a whole year, \'most, and if\r\nI\'d s\'posed you was going away again right off, the first thing, I\r\nwouldn\'t have helped one mite to meet you with flags and bands and\r\nthings, that day you come from the Sanatorium."\r\n\r\n"Why, Jimmy Bean!" ejaculated Pollyanna, in amazed disapproval. Then,\r\nwith a touch of superiority born of hurt pride, she observed: "I\'m\r\nsure I didn\'t ASK you to meet me with bands and things--and you made\r\ntwo mistakes in that sentence. You shouldn\'t say \'you was\'; and I\r\nthink \'you come\' is wrong. It doesn\'t sound right, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Well, who cares if I did?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna\'s eyes grew still more disapproving.\r\n\r\n"You SAID you did--when you asked me this summer to tell you when you\r\nsaid things wrong, because Mr. Pendleton was trying to make you talk\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you\'d been brought up in a \'sylum without any folks that\r\ncared, instead of by a whole lot of old women who didn\'t have anything\r\nto do but tell you how to talk right, maybe you\'d say \'you was,\' and a\r\nwhole lot more worse things, Pollyanna Whittier!"\r\n\r\n"Why, Jimmy Bean!" flared Pollyanna. "My Ladies\' Aiders weren\'t old\r\nwomen--that is, not many of them, so very old," she corrected hastily,\r\nher usual proclivity for truth and literalness superseding her anger;\r\n"and--"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not Jimmy Bean, either," interrupted the boy, uptilting his\r\nchin.\r\n\r\n"You\'re--not-- Why, Jimmy Be-- --What do you mean?" demanded the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been adopted, LEGALLY. He\'s been intending to do it, all along,\r\nhe says, only he didn\'t get to it. Now he\'s done it. I\'m to be called\r\n\'Jimmy Pendleton\' and I\'m to call him Uncle John, only I ain\'t--are\r\nnot--I mean, I AM not used to it yet, so I hain\'t--haven\'t begun to\r\ncall him that, much."\r\n\r\nThe boy still spoke crossly, aggrievedly, but every trace of\r\ndispleasure had fled from the little girl\'s face at his words. She\r\nclapped her hands joyfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how splendid! Now you\'ve really got FOLKS--folks that care, you\r\nknow. And you won\'t ever have to explain that he wasn\'t BORN your\r\nfolks, \'cause your name\'s the same now. I\'m so glad, GLAD, GLAD!"\r\n\r\nThe boy got up suddenly from the stone wall where they had been\r\nsitting, and walked off. His cheeks felt hot, and his eyes smarted\r\nwith tears. It was to Pollyanna that he owed it all--this great good\r\nthat had come to him; and he knew it. And it was to Pollyanna that he\r\nhad just now been saying--\r\n\r\nHe kicked a small stone fiercely, then another, and another. He\r\nthought those hot tears in his eyes were going to spill over and roll\r\ndown his cheeks in spite of himself. He kicked another stone, then\r\nanother; then he picked up a third stone and threw it with all his\r\nmight. A minute later he strolled back to Pollyanna still sitting on\r\nthe stone wall.\r\n\r\n"I bet you I can hit that pine tree down there before you can," he\r\nchallenged airily.\r\n\r\n"Bet you can\'t," cried Pollyanna, scrambling down from her perch.\r\n\r\nThe race was not run after all, for Pollyanna remembered just in time\r\nthat running fast was yet one of the forbidden luxuries for her. But\r\nso far as Jimmy was concerned, it did not matter. His cheeks were no\r\nlonger hot, his eyes were not threatening to overflow with tears.\r\nJimmy was himself again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA DOSE OF POLLYANNA\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the eighth of September approached--the day Pollyanna was to\r\narrive--Mrs. Ruth Carew became more and more nervously exasperated\r\nwith herself. She declared that she had regretted just ONCE her\r\npromise to take the child--and that was ever since she had given it.\r\nBefore twenty-four hours had passed she had, indeed, written to her\r\nsister demanding that she be released from the agreement; but Della\r\nhad answered that it was quite too late, as already both she and Dr.\r\nAmes had written the Chiltons.\r\n\r\nSoon after that had come Della\'s letter saying that Mrs. Chilton had\r\ngiven her consent, and would in a few days come to Boston to make\r\narrangements as to school, and the like. So there was nothing to be\r\ndone, naturally, but to let matters take their course. Mrs. Carew\r\nrealized that, and submitted to the inevitable, but with poor grace.\r\nTrue, she tried to be decently civil when Della and Mrs. Chilton made\r\ntheir expected appearance; but she was very glad that limited time\r\nmade Mrs. Chilton\'s stay of very short duration, and full to the brim\r\nof business.\r\n\r\nIt was well, indeed, perhaps, that Pollyanna\'s arrival was to be at a\r\ndate no later than the eighth; for time, instead of reconciling Mrs.\r\nCarew to the prospective new member of her household, was filling her\r\nwith angry impatience at what she was pleased to call her "absurd\r\nyielding to Della\'s crazy scheme."\r\n\r\nNor was Della herself in the least unaware of her sister\'s state of\r\nmind. If outwardly she maintained a bold front, inwardly she was very\r\nfearful as to results; but on Pollyanna she was pinning her faith, and\r\nbecause she did pin her faith on Pollyanna, she determined on the bold\r\nstroke of leaving the little girl to begin her fight entirely unaided\r\nand alone. She contrived, therefore, that Mrs. Carew should meet them\r\nat the station upon their arrival; then, as soon as greetings and\r\nintroductions were over, she hurriedly pleaded a previous engagement\r\nand took herself off. Mrs. Carew, therefore, had scarcely time to look\r\nat her new charge before she found herself alone with the child.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Della, Della, you mustn\'t--I can\'t--" she called agitatedly,\r\nafter the retreating figure of the nurse.\r\n\r\nBut Della, if she heard, did not heed; and, plainly annoyed and vexed,\r\nMrs. Carew turned back to the child at her side.\r\n\r\n"What a shame! She didn\'t hear, did she?" Pollyanna was saying, her\r\neyes, also, wistfully following the nurse. "And I didn\'t WANT her to\r\ngo now a bit. But then, I\'ve got you, haven\'t I? I can be glad for\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you\'ve got me--and I\'ve got you," returned the lady, not\r\nvery graciously. "Come, we go this way," she directed, with a motion\r\ntoward the right.\r\n\r\nObediently Pollyanna turned and trotted at Mrs. Carew\'s side, through\r\nthe huge station; but she looked up once or twice rather anxiously\r\ninto the lady\'s unsmiling face. At last she spoke hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n"I expect maybe you thought--I\'d be pretty," she hazarded, in a\r\ntroubled voice.\r\n\r\n"P--pretty?" repeated Mrs. Carew.\r\n\r\n"Yes--with curls, you know, and all that. And of course you did wonder\r\nhow I DID look, just as I did you. Only I KNEW you\'d be pretty and\r\nnice, on account of your sister. I had her to go by, and you didn\'t\r\nhave anybody. And of course I\'m not pretty, on account of the\r\nfreckles, and it ISN\'T nice when you\'ve been expecting a PRETTY little\r\ngirl, to have one come like me; and--"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, child!" interrupted Mrs. Carew, a trifle sharply. "Come,\r\nwe\'ll see to your trunk now, then we\'ll go home. I had hoped that my\r\nsister would come with us; but it seems she didn\'t see fit--even for\r\nthis one night."\r\n\r\nPollyanna smiled and nodded.\r\n\r\n"I know; but she couldn\'t, probably. Somebody wanted her, I expect.\r\nSomebody was always wanting her at the Sanatorium. It\'s a bother, of\r\ncourse, when folks do want you all the time, isn\'t it?--\'cause you\r\ncan\'t have yourself when you want yourself, lots of times. Still, you\r\ncan be kind of glad for that, for it IS nice to be wanted, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply--perhaps because for the first time in her life\r\nMrs. Carew was wondering if anywhere in the world there was any one\r\nwho really wanted her--not that she WISHED to be wanted, of course,\r\nshe told herself angrily, pulling herself up with a jerk, and frowning\r\ndown at the child by her side.\r\n\r\nPollyanna did not see the frown. Pollyanna\'s eyes were on the hurrying\r\nthrongs about them.\r\n\r\n"My! what a lot of people," she was saying happily. "There\'s even more\r\nof them than there was the other time I was here; but I haven\'t seen\r\nanybody, yet, that I saw then, though I\'ve looked for them everywhere.\r\nOf course the lady and the little baby lived in Honolulu, so probably\r\nTHEY WOULDN\'T be here; but there was a little girl, Susie Smith--she\r\nlived right here in Boston. Maybe you know her though. Do you know\r\nSusie Smith?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t know Susie Smith," replied Mrs. Carew, dryly.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? She\'s awfully nice, and SHE\'S pretty--black curls, you\r\nknow; the kind I\'m going to have when I go to Heaven. But never mind;\r\nmaybe I can find her for you so you WILL know her. Oh, my! what a\r\nperfectly lovely automobile! And are we going to ride in it?" broke\r\noff Pollyanna, as they came to a pause before a handsome limousine,\r\nthe door of which a liveried chauffeur was holding open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'Oh, my! What a perfectly lovely automobile!\'"]\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur tried to hide a smile--and failed. Mrs. Carew, however,\r\nanswered with the weariness of one to whom "rides" are never anything\r\nbut a means of locomotion from one tiresome place to another probably\r\nquite as tiresome.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we\'re going to ride in it." Then "Home, Perkins," she added to\r\nthe deferential chauffeur.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my, is it yours?" asked Pollyanna, detecting the unmistakable air\r\nof ownership in her hostess\'s manner. "How perfectly lovely! Then you\r\nmust be rich--awfully--I mean EXCEEDINGLY rich, more than the kind\r\nthat just has carpets in every room and ice cream Sundays, like the\r\nWhites--one of my Ladies\' Aiders, you know. (That is, SHE was a\r\nLadies\' Aider.) I used to think THEY were rich, but I know now that\r\nbeing really rich means you\'ve got diamond rings and hired girls and\r\nsealskin coats, and dresses made of silk and velvet for every day, and\r\nan automobile. Have you got all those?"\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes, I suppose I have," admitted Mrs. Carew, with a faint\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Then you are rich, of course," nodded Pollyanna, wisely. "My Aunt\r\nPolly has them, too, only her automobile is a horse. My! but don\'t I\r\njust love to ride in these things," exulted Pollyanna, with a happy\r\nlittle bounce. "You see I never did before, except the one that ran\r\nover me. They put me IN that one after they\'d got me out from under\r\nit; but of course I didn\'t know about it, so I couldn\'t enjoy it.\r\nSince then I haven\'t been in one at all. Aunt Polly doesn\'t like them.\r\nUncle Tom does, though, and he wants one. He says he\'s got to have\r\none, in his business. He\'s a doctor, you know, and all the other\r\ndoctors in town have got them now. I don\'t know how it will come out.\r\nAunt Polly is all stirred up over it. You see, she wants Uncle Tom to\r\nhave what he wants, only she wants him to want what she wants him to\r\nwant. See?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew laughed suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear, I think I see," she answered demurely, though her eyes\r\nstill carried--for them--a most unusual twinkle.\r\n\r\n"All right," sighed Pollyanna contentedly. "I thought you would;\r\nstill, it did sound sort of mixed when I said it. Oh, Aunt Polly says\r\nshe wouldn\'t mind having an automobile, so much, if she could have the\r\nonly one there was in the world, so there wouldn\'t be any one else to\r\nrun into her; but--My! what a lot of houses!" broke off Pollyanna,\r\nlooking about her with round eyes of wonder. "Don\'t they ever stop?\r\nStill, there\'d have to be a lot of them for all those folks to live\r\nin, of course, that I saw at the station, besides all these here on\r\nthe streets. And of course where there ARE more folks, there are more\r\nto know. I love folks. Don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"LOVE FOLKS!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, just folks, I mean. Anybody--everybody."\r\n\r\n"Well, no, Pollyanna, I can\'t say that I do," replied Mrs. Carew,\r\ncoldly, her brows contracted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew\'s eyes had lost their twinkle. They were turned rather\r\nmistrustfully, indeed, on Pollyanna. To herself Mrs. Carew was saying:\r\n"Now for preachment number one, I suppose, on my duty to mix with my\r\nfellow-men, a la Sister Della!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? Oh, I do," sighed Pollyanna. "They\'re all so nice and so\r\ndifferent, you know. And down here there must be such a lot of them to\r\nbe nice and different. Oh, you don\'t know how glad I am so soon that I\r\ncame! I knew I would be, anyway, just as soon as I found out you were\r\nYOU--that is, Miss Wetherby\'s sister, I mean. I love Miss Wetherby, so\r\nI knew I should you, too; for of course you\'d be alike--sisters,\r\nso--even if you weren\'t twins like Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Peck--and they\r\nweren\'t quite alike, anyway, on account of the wart. But I reckon you\r\ndon\'t know what I mean, so I\'ll tell you."\r\n\r\nAnd thus it happened that Mrs. Carew, who had been steeling herself\r\nfor a preachment on social ethics, found herself, much to her surprise\r\nand a little to her discomfiture, listening to the story of a wart on\r\nthe nose of one Mrs. Peck, Ladies\' Aider.\r\n\r\nBy the time the story was finished the limousine had turned into\r\nCommonwealth Avenue, and Pollyanna immediately began to exclaim at the\r\nbeauty of a street which had such a "lovely big long yard all the way\r\nup and down through the middle of it," and which was all the nicer,\r\nshe said, "after all those little narrow streets."\r\n\r\n"Only I should think every one would want to live on it," she\r\ncommented enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n"Very likely; but that would hardly be possible," retorted Mrs. Carew,\r\nwith uplifted eyebrows.\r\n\r\nPollyanna, mistaking the expression on her face for one of\r\ndissatisfaction that her own home was not on the beautiful Avenue,\r\nhastened to make amends.\r\n\r\n"Why, no, of course not," she agreed. "And I didn\'t mean that the\r\nnarrower streets weren\'t just as nice," she hurried on; "and even\r\nbetter, maybe, because you could be glad you didn\'t have to go so far\r\nwhen you wanted to run across the way to borrow eggs or soda, and--Oh,\r\nbut DO you live here?" she interrupted herself, as the car came to a\r\nstop before the imposing Carew doorway. "Do you live here, Mrs.\r\nCarew?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, of course I live here," returned the lady, with just a\r\ntouch of irritation.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how glad, GLAD you must be to live in such a perfectly lovely\r\nplace!" exulted the little girl, springing to the sidewalk and looking\r\neagerly about her. "Aren\'t you glad?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew did not reply. With unsmiling lips and frowning brow she\r\nwas stepping from the limousine.\r\n\r\nFor the second time in five minutes, Pollyanna hastened to make\r\namends.\r\n\r\n"Of course I don\'t mean the kind of glad that\'s sinfully proud," she\r\nexplained, searching Mrs. Carew\'s face with anxious eyes. "Maybe you\r\nthought I did, same as Aunt Polly used to, sometimes. I don\'t mean the\r\nkind that\'s glad because you\'ve got something somebody else can\'t\r\nhave; but the kind that just--just makes you want to shout and yell\r\nand bang doors, you know, even if it isn\'t proper," she finished,\r\ndancing up and down on her toes.\r\n\r\nThe chauffeur turned his back precipitately, and busied himself with\r\nthe car. Mrs. Carew, still with unsmiling lips and frowning brow led\r\nthe way up the broad stone steps.\r\n\r\n"Come, Pollyanna," was all she said, crisply.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was five days later that Della Wetherby received the letter from\r\nher sister, and very eagerly she tore it open. It was the first that\r\nhad come since Pollyanna\'s arrival in Boston.\r\n\r\n"My dear Sister," Mrs. Carew had written. "For pity\'s sake, Della, why\r\ndidn\'t you give me some sort of an idea what to expect from this child\r\nyou have insisted upon my taking? I\'m nearly wild--and I simply can\'t\r\nsend her away. I\'ve tried to three times, but every time, before I get\r\nthe words out of my mouth, she stops them by telling me what a\r\nperfectly lovely time she is having, and how glad she is to be here,\r\nand how good I am to let her live with me while her Aunt Polly has\r\ngone to Germany. Now how, pray, in the face of that, can I turn around\r\nand say \'Well, won\'t you please go home; I don\'t want you\'? And the\r\nabsurd part of it is, I don\'t believe it has ever entered her head\r\nthat I don\'t WANT her here; and I can\'t seem to make it enter her\r\nhead, either.\r\n\r\n"Of course if she begins to preach, and to tell me to count my\r\nblessings, I SHALL send her away. You know I told you, to begin with,\r\nthat I wouldn\'t permit that. And I won\'t. Two or three times I have\r\nthought she was going to (preach, I mean), but so far she has always\r\nended up with some ridiculous story about those Ladies\' Aiders of\r\nhers; so the sermon gets sidetracked--luckily for her, if she wants to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\n"But, really, Della, she is impossible. Listen. In the first place she\r\nis wild with delight over the house. The very first day she got here\r\nshe begged me to open every room; and she was not satisfied until\r\nevery shade in the house was up, so that she might \'see all the\r\nperfectly lovely things,\' which, she declared, were even nicer than\r\nMr. John Pendleton\'s--whoever he may be, somebody in Beldingsville, I\r\nbelieve. Anyhow, he isn\'t a Ladies\' Aider. I\'ve found out that much.\r\n\r\n"Then, as if it wasn\'t enough to keep me running from room to room (as\r\nif I were the guide on a \'personally conducted\'), what did she do but\r\ndiscover a white satin evening gown that I hadn\'t worn for years, and\r\nbeseech me to put it on. And I did put it on--why, I can\'t imagine,\r\nonly that I found myself utterly helpless in her hands.\r\n\r\n"But that was only the beginning. She begged then to see everything\r\nthat I had, and she was so perfectly funny in her stories of the\r\nmissionary barrels, which she used to \'dress out of,\' that I had to\r\nlaugh--though I almost cried, too, to think of the wretched things\r\nthat poor child had to wear. Of course gowns led to jewels, and she\r\nmade such a fuss over my two or three rings that I foolishly opened\r\nthe safe, just to see her eyes pop out. And, Della, I thought that\r\nchild would go crazy. She put on to me every ring, brooch, bracelet,\r\nand necklace that I owned, and insisted on fastening both diamond\r\ntiaras in my hair (when she found out what they were), until there I\r\nsat, hung with pearls and diamonds and emeralds, and feeling like a\r\nheathen goddess in a Hindu temple, especially when that preposterous\r\nchild began to dance round and round me, clapping her hands and\r\nchanting, \'Oh, how perfectly lovely, how perfectly lovely! How I would\r\nlove to hang you on a string in the window--you\'d make such a\r\nbeautiful prism!\'\r\n\r\n"I was just going to ask her what on earth she meant by that when down\r\nshe dropped in the middle of the floor and began to cry. And what do\r\nyou suppose she was crying for? Because she was so glad she\'d got eyes\r\nthat could see! Now what do you think of that?\r\n\r\n"Of course this isn\'t all. It\'s only the beginning. Pollyanna has been\r\nhere four days, and she\'s filled every one of them full. She already\r\nnumbers among her friends the ash-man, the policeman on the beat, and\r\nthe paper boy, to say nothing of every servant in my employ. They seem\r\nactually bewitched with her, every one of them. But please do not\r\nthink _I_ am, for I\'m not. I would send the child back to you at once\r\nif I didn\'t feel obliged to fulfil my promise to keep her this winter.\r\nAs for her making me forget Jamie and my great sorrow--that is\r\nimpossible. She only makes me feel my loss all the more\r\nkeenly--because I have her instead of him. But, as I said, I shall\r\nkeep her--until she begins to preach. Then back she goes to you. But\r\nshe hasn\'t preached yet.\r\n\r\n                                    "Lovingly but distractedly yours,\r\n\r\n                                    "RUTH."\r\n\r\n"\'Hasn\'t preached yet,\' indeed!" chuckled Della Wetherby to herself,\r\nfolding up the closely-written sheets of her sister\'s letter. "Oh,\r\nRuth, Ruth! and yet you admit that you\'ve opened every room, raised\r\nevery shade, decked yourself in satin and jewels--and Pollyanna hasn\'t\r\nbeen there a week yet. But she hasn\'t preached--oh, no, she hasn\'t\r\npreached!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE GAME AND MRS. CAREW\r\n\r\n\r\nBoston, to Pollyanna, was a new experience, and certainly Pollyanna,\r\nto Boston--such part of it as was privileged to know her--was very\r\nmuch of a new experience.\r\n\r\nPollyanna said she liked Boston, but that she did wish it was not\r\nquite so big.\r\n\r\n"You see," she explained earnestly to Mrs. Carew, the day following\r\nher arrival, "I want to see and know it ALL, and I can\'t. It\'s just\r\nlike Aunt Polly\'s company dinners; there\'s so much to eat--I mean, to\r\nsee--that you don\'t eat--I mean, see--anything, because you\'re always\r\ntrying to decide what to eat--I mean, to see.\r\n\r\n"Of course you can be glad there IS such a lot," resumed Pollyanna,\r\nafter taking breath, "\'cause a whole lot of anything is nice--that is,\r\nGOOD things; not such things as medicine and funerals, of course!--but\r\nat the same time I couldn\'t used to help wishing Aunt Polly\'s company\r\ndinners could be spread out a little over the days when there wasn\'t\r\nany cake and pie; and I feel the same way about Boston. I wish I could\r\ntake part of it home with me up to Beldingsville so I\'d have SOMETHING\r\nnew next summer. But of course I can\'t. Cities aren\'t like frosted\r\ncake--and, anyhow, even the cake didn\'t keep very well. I tried it,\r\nand it dried up, \'specially the frosting. I reckon the time to take\r\nfrosting and good times is while they are going; so I want to see all\r\nI can now while I\'m here."\r\n\r\nPollyanna, unlike the people who think that to see the world one must\r\nbegin at the most distant point, began her "seeing Boston" by a\r\nthorough exploration of her immediate surroundings--the beautiful\r\nCommonwealth Avenue residence which was now her home. This, with her\r\nschool work, fully occupied her time and attention for some days.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to see, and so much to learn; and everything was so\r\nmarvelous and so beautiful, from the tiny buttons in the wall that\r\nflooded the rooms with light, to the great silent ballroom hung with\r\nmirrors and pictures. There were so many delightful people to know,\r\ntoo, for besides Mrs. Carew herself there were Mary, who dusted the\r\ndrawing-rooms, answered the bell, and accompanied Pollyanna to and\r\nfrom school each day; Bridget, who lived in the kitchen and cooked;\r\nJennie, who waited at table, and Perkins who drove the automobile. And\r\nthey were all so delightful--yet so different!\r\n\r\nPollyanna had arrived on a Monday, so it was almost a week before the\r\nfirst Sunday. She came downstairs that morning with a beaming\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"I love Sundays," she sighed happily.\r\n\r\n"Do you?" Mrs. Carew\'s voice had the weariness of one who loves no\r\nday.\r\n\r\n"Yes, on account of church, you know, and Sunday school. Which do you\r\nlike best, church, or Sunday school?"\r\n\r\n"Well, really, I--" began Mrs. Carew, who seldom went to church and\r\nnever went to Sunday school.\r\n\r\n"\'Tis hard to tell, isn\'t it?" interposed Pollyanna, with luminous but\r\nserious eyes. "But you see _I_ like church best, on account of father.\r\nYou know he was a minister, and of course he\'s really up in Heaven\r\nwith mother and the rest of us, but I try to imagine him down here,\r\nlots of times; and it\'s easiest in church, when the minister is\r\ntalking. I shut my eyes and imagine it\'s father up there; and it helps\r\nlots. I\'m so glad we can imagine things, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not so sure of that, Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but just think how much nicer our IMAGINED things are than our\r\nreally truly ones--that is, of course, yours aren\'t, because your REAL\r\nones are so nice." Mrs. Carew angrily started to speak, but Pollyanna\r\nwas hurrying on. "And of course MY real ones are ever so much nicer\r\nthan they used to be. But all that time I was hurt, when my legs\r\ndidn\'t go, I just had to keep imagining all the time, just as hard as\r\nI could. And of course now there are lots of times when I do it--like\r\nabout father, and all that. And so to-day I\'m just going to imagine\r\nit\'s father up there in the pulpit. What time do we go?"\r\n\r\n"GO?"\r\n\r\n"To church, I mean."\r\n\r\n"But, Pollyanna, I don\'t--that is, I\'d rather not--" Mrs. Carew\r\ncleared her throat and tried again to say that she was not going to\r\nchurch at all; that she almost never went. But with Pollyanna\'s\r\nconfident little face and happy eyes before her, she could not do it.\r\n\r\n"Why, I suppose--about quarter past ten--if we walk," she said then,\r\nalmost crossly. "It\'s only a little way."\r\n\r\nThus it happened that Mrs. Carew on that bright September morning\r\noccupied for the first time in months the Carew pew in the very\r\nfashionable and elegant church to which she had gone as a girl, and\r\nwhich she still supported liberally--so far as money went.\r\n\r\nTo Pollyanna that Sunday morning service was a great wonder and joy.\r\nThe marvelous music of the vested choir, the opalescent rays from the\r\njeweled windows, the impassioned voice of the preacher, and the\r\nreverent hush of the worshiping throng filled her with an ecstasy that\r\nleft her for a time almost speechless. Not until they were nearly home\r\ndid she fervently breathe:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Carew, I\'ve just been thinking how glad I am we don\'t have\r\nto live but just one day at a time!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew frowned and looked down sharply. Mrs. Carew was in no mood\r\nfor preaching. She had just been obliged to endure it from the pulpit,\r\nshe told herself angrily, and she would NOT listen to it from this\r\nchit of a child. Moreover, this "living one day at a time" theory was\r\na particularly pet doctrine of Della\'s. Was not Della always saying:\r\n"But you only have to live one minute at a time, Ruth, and any one can\r\nendure anything for one minute at a time!"\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Mrs. Carew now, tersely.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Only think what I\'d do if I had to live yesterday and to-day and\r\nto-morrow all at once," sighed Pollyanna. "Such a lot of perfectly\r\nlovely things, you know. But I\'ve had yesterday, and now I\'m living\r\nto-day, and I\'ve got to-morrow still coming, and next Sunday, too.\r\nHonestly, Mrs. Carew, if it wasn\'t Sunday now, and on this nice quiet\r\nstreet, I should just dance and shout and yell. I couldn\'t help it.\r\nBut it\'s being Sunday, so, I shall have to wait till I get home and\r\nthen take a hymn--the most rejoicingest hymn I can think of. What is\r\nthe most rejoicingest hymn? Do you know, Mrs. Carew?"\r\n\r\n"No, I can\'t say that I do," answered Mrs. Carew, faintly, looking\r\nvery much as if she were searching for something she had lost. For a\r\nwoman who expects, because things are so bad, to be told that she need\r\nstand only one day at a time, it is disarming, to say the least, to be\r\ntold that, because things are so good, it is lucky she does not HAVE\r\nto stand but one day at a time!\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the next morning, Pollyanna went to school for the first\r\ntime alone. She knew the way perfectly now, and it was only a short\r\nwalk. Pollyanna enjoyed her school very much. It was a small private\r\nschool for girls, and was quite a new experience, in its way; but\r\nPollyanna liked new experiences.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew, however, did not like new experiences, and she was having\r\na good many of them these days. For one who is tired of everything to\r\nbe in so intimate a companionship with one to whom everything is a\r\nfresh and fascinating joy must needs result in annoyance, to say the\r\nleast. And Mrs. Carew was more than annoyed. She was exasperated. Yet\r\nto herself she was forced to admit that if any one asked her why she\r\nwas exasperated, the only reason she could give would be "Because\r\nPollyanna is so glad"--and even Mrs. Carew would hardly like to give\r\nan answer like that.\r\n\r\nTo Della, however, Mrs. Carew did write that the word "glad" had got\r\non her nerves, and that sometimes she wished she might never hear it\r\nagain. She still admitted that Pollyanna had not preached--that she\r\nhad not even once tried to make her play the game. What the child did\r\ndo, however, was invariably to take Mrs. Carew\'s "gladness" as a\r\nmatter of course, which, to one who HAD no gladness, was most\r\nprovoking.\r\n\r\nIt was during the second week of Pollyanna\'s stay that Mrs. Carew\'s\r\nannoyance overflowed into irritable remonstrance. The immediate cause\r\nthereof was Pollyanna\'s glowing conclusion to a story about one of her\r\nLadies\' Aiders.\r\n\r\n"She was playing the game, Mrs. Carew. But maybe you don\'t know what\r\nthe game is. I\'ll tell you. It\'s a lovely game."\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Carew held up her hand.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Pollyanna," she demurred. "I know all about the game. My\r\nsister told me, and--and I must say that I--I should not care for it."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course not, Mrs. Carew!" exclaimed Pollyanna in quick\r\napology. "I didn\'t mean the game for you. You couldn\'t play it, of\r\ncourse."\r\n\r\n"I COULDN\'T play it!" ejaculated Mrs. Carew, who, though she WOULD not\r\nplay this silly game, was in no mood to be told that she COULD not.\r\n\r\n"Why, no, don\'t you see?" laughed Pollyanna, gleefully. "The game is\r\nto find something in everything to be glad about; and you couldn\'t\r\neven begin to hunt, for there isn\'t anything about you but what you\r\nCOULD be glad about. There wouldn\'t BE any game to it for you! Don\'t\r\nyou see?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew flushed angrily. In her annoyance she said more than\r\nperhaps she meant to say.\r\n\r\n"Well, no, Pollyanna, I can\'t say that I do," she differed coldly. "As\r\nit happens, you see, I can find nothing whatever to be--glad for."\r\n\r\nFor a moment Pollyanna stared blankly. Then she fell back in\r\namazement.\r\n\r\n"Why, MRS. CAREW!" she breathed.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is there--for me?" challenged the woman, forgetting all\r\nabout, for the moment, that she was never going to allow Pollyanna to\r\n"preach."\r\n\r\n"Why, there\'s--there\'s everything," murmured Pollyanna, still with\r\nthat dazed unbelief. "There--there\'s this beautiful house."\r\n\r\n"It\'s just a place to eat and sleep--and I don\'t want to eat and\r\nsleep."\r\n\r\n"But there are all these perfectly lovely things," faltered Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"I\'m tired of them."\r\n\r\n"And your automobile that will take you anywhere."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want to go anywhere."\r\n\r\nPollyanna quite gasped aloud.\r\n\r\n"But think of the people and things you could see, Mrs. Carew."\r\n\r\n"They would not interest me, Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nOnce again Pollyanna stared in amazement. The troubled frown on her\r\nface deepened.\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Carew, I don\'t see," she urged. "Always, before, there have\r\nbeen BAD things for folks to play the game on, and the badder they are\r\nthe more fun \'tis to get them out--find the things to be glad for, I\r\nmean. But where there AREN\'T any bad things, I shouldn\'t know how to\r\nplay the game myself."\r\n\r\nThere was no answer for a time. Mrs. Carew sat with her eyes out the\r\nwindow. Gradually the angry rebellion on her face changed to a look of\r\nhopeless sadness. Very slowly then she turned and said:\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, I had thought I wouldn\'t tell you this; but I\'ve decided\r\nthat I will. I\'m going to tell you why nothing that I have can make\r\nme--glad." And she began the story of Jamie, the little four-year-old\r\nboy who, eight long years before, had stepped as into another world,\r\nleaving the door fast shut between.\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve never seen him since--anywhere?" faltered Pollyanna, with\r\ntear-wet eyes, when the story was done.\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"But we\'ll find him, Mrs. Carew--I\'m sure we\'ll find him."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew shook her head sadly.\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t. I\'ve looked everywhere, even in foreign lands."\r\n\r\n"But he must be somewhere."\r\n\r\n"He may be--dead, Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a quick cry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, Mrs. Carew. Please don\'t say that! Let\'s imagine he\'s alive.\r\nWe CAN do that, and that\'ll help; and when we get him IMAGINED alive\r\nwe can just as well imagine we\'re going to find him. And that\'ll help\r\na whole lot more."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m afraid he\'s--dead, Pollyanna," choked Mrs. Carew.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know it for sure, do you?" besought the little girl,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n"N-no."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you\'re just imagining it," maintained Pollyanna, in\r\ntriumph. "And if you can imagine him dead, you can just as well\r\nimagine him alive, and it\'ll be a whole lot nicer while you\'re doing\r\nit. Don\'t you see? And some day, I\'m just sure you\'ll find him. Why,\r\nMrs. Carew, you CAN play the game now! You can play it on Jamie. You\r\ncan be glad every day, for every day brings you just one day nearer to\r\nthe time when you\'re going to find him. See?"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Carew did not "see." She rose drearily to her feet and said:\r\n\r\n"No, no, child! You don\'t understand--you don\'t understand. Now run\r\naway, please, and read, or do anything you like. My head aches. I\'m\r\ngoing to lie down."\r\n\r\nAnd Pollyanna, with a troubled, sober face, slowly left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPOLLYANNA TAKES A WALK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the second Saturday afternoon that Pollyanna took her\r\nmemorable walk. Heretofore Pollyanna had not walked out alone, except\r\nto go to and from school. That she would ever attempt to explore\r\nBoston streets by herself, never occurred to Mrs. Carew, hence she\r\nnaturally had never forbidden it. In Beldingsville, however, Pollyanna\r\nhad found--especially at the first--her chief diversion in strolling\r\nabout the rambling old village streets in search of new friends and\r\nnew adventures.\r\n\r\nOn this particular Saturday afternoon Mrs. Carew had said, as she\r\noften did say: "There, there, child, run away; please do. Go where you\r\nlike and do what you like, only don\'t, please, ask me any more\r\nquestions to-day!"\r\n\r\nUntil now, left to herself, Pollyanna had always found plenty to\r\ninterest her within the four walls of the house; for, if inanimate\r\nthings failed, there were yet Mary, Jennie, Bridget, and Perkins.\r\nTo-day, however, Mary had a headache, Jennie was trimming a new hat,\r\nBridget was making apple pies, and Perkins was nowhere to be found.\r\nMoreover it was a particularly beautiful September day, and nothing\r\nwithin the house was so alluring as the bright sunlight and balmy air\r\noutside. So outside Pollyanna went and dropped herself down on the\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nFor some time she watched in silence the well-dressed men, women, and\r\nchildren, who walked briskly by the house, or else sauntered more\r\nleisurely through the parkway that extended up and down the middle of\r\nthe Avenue. Then she got to her feet, skipped down the steps, and\r\nstood looking, first to the right, then to the left.\r\n\r\nPollyanna had decided that she, too, would take a walk. It was a\r\nbeautiful day for a walk, and not once, yet, had she taken one at\r\nall--not a REAL walk. Just going to and from school did not count. So\r\nshe would take one to-day. Mrs. Carew would not mind. Had she not told\r\nher to do just what she pleased so long as she asked no more\r\nquestions? And there was the whole long afternoon before her. Only\r\nthink what a lot one might see in a whole long afternoon! And it\r\nreally was such a beautiful day. She would go--this way! And with a\r\nlittle whirl and skip of pure joy, Pollyanna turned and walked\r\nblithely down the Avenue.\r\n\r\nInto the eyes of those she met Pollyanna smiled joyously. She was\r\ndisappointed--but not surprised--that she received no answering smile\r\nin return. She was used to that now--in Boston. She still smiled,\r\nhowever, hopefully: there might be some one, sometime, who would smile\r\nback.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew\'s home was very near the beginning of Commonwealth Avenue,\r\nso it was not long before Pollyanna found herself at the edge of a\r\nstreet crossing her way at right angles. Across the street, in all its\r\nautumn glory, lay what to Pollyanna was the most beautiful "yard" she\r\nhad ever seen--the Boston Public Garden.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Pollyanna hesitated, her eyes longingly fixed on the\r\nwealth of beauty before her. That it was the private grounds of some\r\nrich man or woman, she did not for a moment doubt. Once, with Dr. Ames\r\nat the Sanatorium, she had been taken to call on a lady who lived in a\r\nbeautiful house surrounded by just such walks and trees and\r\nflower-beds as these.\r\n\r\nPollyanna wanted now very much to cross the street and walk in those\r\ngrounds, but she doubted if she had the right. To be sure, others were\r\nthere, moving about, she could see; but they might be invited guests,\r\nof course. After she had seen two women, one man, and a little girl\r\nunhesitatingly enter the gate and walk briskly down the path, however,\r\nPollyanna concluded that she, too, might go. Watching her chance she\r\nskipped nimbly across the street and entered the Garden.\r\n\r\nIt was even more beautiful close at hand than it had been at a\r\ndistance. Birds twittered over her head, and a squirrel leaped across\r\nthe path ahead of her. On benches here and there sat men, women, and\r\nchildren. Through the trees flashed the sparkle of the sun on water;\r\nand from somewhere came the shouts of children and the sound of music.\r\n\r\nOnce again Pollyanna hesitated; then, a little timidly, she accosted a\r\nhandsomely-dressed young woman coming toward her.\r\n\r\n"Please, is this--a party?" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe young woman stared.\r\n\r\n"A party!" she repeated dazedly.\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m. I mean, is it all right for me--to be here?"\r\n\r\n"For you to be here? Why, of course. It\'s for--for everybody!"\r\nexclaimed the young woman.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s all right, then. I\'m glad I came," beamed Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nThe young woman said nothing; but she turned back and looked at\r\nPollyanna still dazedly as she hurried away.\r\n\r\nPollyanna, not at all surprised that the owner of this beautiful place\r\nshould be so generous as to give a party to everybody, continued on\r\nher way. At the turn of the path she came upon a small girl and a doll\r\ncarriage. She stopped with a glad little cry, but she had not said a\r\ndozen words before from somewhere came a young woman with hurrying\r\nsteps and a disapproving voice; a young woman who held out her hand to\r\nthe small girl, and said sharply:\r\n\r\n"Here, Gladys, Gladys, come away with me. Hasn\'t mama told you not to\r\ntalk to strange children?"\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not strange children," explained Pollyanna in eager defense.\r\n"I live right here in Boston, now, and--" But the young woman and the\r\nlittle girl dragging the doll carriage were already far down the path;\r\nand with a half-stifled sigh Pollyanna fell back. For a moment she\r\nstood silent, plainly disappointed; then resolutely she lifted her\r\nchin and went forward.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, I can be glad for that," she nodded to herself, "for\r\nnow maybe I\'ll find somebody even nicer--Susie Smith, perhaps, or even\r\nMrs. Carew\'s Jamie. Anyhow, I can IMAGINE I\'m going to find them; and\r\nif I don\'t find THEM, I can find SOMEBODY!" she finished, her wistful\r\neyes on the self-absorbed people all about her.\r\n\r\nUndeniably Pollyanna was lonesome. Brought up by her father and the\r\nLadies\' Aid Society in a small Western town, she had counted every\r\nhouse in the village her home, and every man, woman, and child her\r\nfriend. Coming to her aunt in Vermont at eleven years of age, she had\r\npromptly assumed that conditions would differ only in that the homes\r\nand the friends would be new, and therefore even more delightful,\r\npossibly, for they would be "different"--and Pollyanna did so love\r\n"different" things and people! Her first and always her supreme\r\ndelight in Beldingsville, therefore, had been her long rambles about\r\nthe town and the charming visits with the new friends she had made.\r\nQuite naturally, in consequence, Boston, as she first saw it, seemed\r\nto Pollyanna even more delightfully promising in its possibilities.\r\n\r\nThus far, however, Pollyanna had to admit that in one respect, at\r\nleast, it had been disappointing: she had been here nearly two weeks\r\nand she did not yet know the people who lived across the street, or\r\neven next door. More inexplicable still, Mrs. Carew herself did not\r\nknow many of them, and not any of them well. She seemed, indeed,\r\nutterly indifferent to her neighbors, which was most amazing from\r\nPollyanna\'s point of view; but nothing she could say appeared to\r\nchange Mrs. Carew\'s attitude in the matter at all.\r\n\r\n"They do not interest me, Pollyanna," was all she would say; and with\r\nthis, Pollyanna--whom they did interest very much--was forced to be\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nTo-day, on her walk, however, Pollyanna had started out with high\r\nhopes, yet thus far she seemed destined to be disappointed. Here all\r\nabout her were people who were doubtless most delightful--if she only\r\nknew them. But she did not know them. Worse yet, there seemed to be no\r\nprospect that she would know them, for they did not, apparently, wish\r\nto know her: Pollyanna was still smarting under the nurse\'s sharp\r\nwarning concerning "strange children."\r\n\r\n"Well, I reckon I\'ll just have to show \'em that I\'m not strange\r\nchildren," she said at last to herself, moving confidently forward\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nPursuant of this idea Pollyanna smiled sweetly into the eyes of the\r\nnext person she met, and said blithely:\r\n\r\n"It\'s a nice day, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Er--what? Oh, y-yes, it is," murmured the lady addressed, as she\r\nhastened on a little faster.\r\n\r\nTwice again Pollyanna tried the same experiment, but with like\r\ndisappointing results. Soon she came upon the little pond that she had\r\nseen sparkling in the sunlight through the trees. It was a beautiful\r\npond, and on it were several pretty little boats full of laughing\r\nchildren. As she watched them, Pollyanna felt more and more\r\ndissatisfied to remain by herself. It was then that, spying a man\r\nsitting alone not far away, she advanced slowly toward him and sat\r\ndown on the other end of the bench. Once Pollyanna would have danced\r\nunhesitatingly to the man\'s side and suggested acquaintanceship with a\r\ncheery confidence that had no doubt of a welcome; but recent rebuffs\r\nhad filled her with unaccustomed diffidence. Covertly she looked at\r\nthe man now.\r\n\r\nHe was not very good to look at. His garments, though new, were dusty,\r\nand plainly showed lack of care. They were of the cut and style\r\n(though Pollyanna of course did not know this) that the State gives\r\nits prisoners as a freedom suit. His face was a pasty white, and was\r\nadorned with a week\'s beard. His hat was pulled far down over his\r\neyes. With his hands in his pockets he sat idly staring at the ground.\r\n\r\nFor a long minute Pollyanna said nothing; then hopefully she began:\r\n\r\n"It IS a nice day, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThe man turned his head with a start.\r\n\r\n"Eh? Oh--er--what did you say?" he questioned, with a curiously\r\nfrightened look around to make sure the remark was addressed to him.\r\n\r\n"I said \'twas a nice day," explained Pollyanna in hurried earnestness;\r\n"but I don\'t care about that especially. That is, of course I\'m glad\r\nit\'s a nice day, but I said it just as a beginning to things, and I\'d\r\njust as soon talk about something else--anything else. It\'s only that\r\nI wanted you to talk--about something, you see."\r\n\r\nThe man gave a low laugh. Even to Pollyanna the laugh sounded a little\r\nqueer, though she did not know (as did the man) that a laugh to his\r\nlips had been a stranger for many months.\r\n\r\n"So you want me to talk, do you?" he said a little sadly. "Well, I\r\ndon\'t see but what I shall have to do it, then. Still, I should think\r\na nice little lady like you might find lots nicer people to talk to\r\nthan an old duffer like me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I like old duffers," exclaimed Pollyanna quickly; "that is, I\r\nlike the OLD part, and I don\'t know what a duffer is, so I can\'t\r\ndislike that. Besides, if you are a duffer, I reckon I like duffers.\r\nAnyhow, I like you," she finished, with a contented little settling of\r\nherself in her seat that carried conviction.\r\n\r\n"Humph! Well, I\'m sure I\'m flattered," smiled the man, ironically.\r\nThough his face and words expressed polite doubt, it might have been\r\nnoticed that he sat a little straighter on the bench. "And, pray, what\r\nshall we talk about?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s--it\'s infinitesimal to me. That means I don\'t care, doesn\'t it?"\r\nasked Pollyanna, with a beaming smile. "Aunt Polly says that, whatever\r\nI talk about, anyhow, I always bring up at the Ladies\' Aiders. But I\r\nreckon that\'s because they brought me up first, don\'t you? We might\r\ntalk about the party. I think it\'s a perfectly beautiful party--now\r\nthat I know some one."\r\n\r\n"P-party?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--this, you know--all these people here to-day. It IS a party,\r\nisn\'t it? The lady said it was for everybody, so I stayed--though I\r\nhaven\'t got to where the house is, yet, that\'s giving the party."\r\n\r\nThe man\'s lips twitched.\r\n\r\n"Well, little lady, perhaps it is a party, in a way," he smiled; "but\r\nthe \'house\' that\'s giving it is the city of Boston. This is the Public\r\nGarden--a public park, you understand, for everybody."\r\n\r\n"Is it? Always? And I may come here any time I want to? Oh, how\r\nperfectly lovely! That\'s even nicer than I thought it could be. I\'d\r\nworried for fear I couldn\'t ever come again, after to-day, you see.\r\nI\'m glad now, though, that I didn\'t know it just at the first, for\r\nit\'s all the nicer now. Nice things are nicer when you\'ve been\r\nworrying for fear they won\'t be nice, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps they are--if they ever turn out to be nice at all," conceded\r\nthe man, a little gloomily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I think so," nodded Pollyanna, not noticing the gloom. "But\r\nisn\'t it beautiful--here?" she gloried. "I wonder if Mrs. Carew knows\r\nabout it--that it\'s for anybody, so. Why, I should think everybody\r\nwould want to come here all the time, and just stay and look around."\r\n\r\nThe man\'s face hardened.\r\n\r\n"Well, there are a few people in the world who have got a job--who\'ve\r\ngot something to do besides just to come here and stay and look\r\naround; but I don\'t happen to be one of them."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you? Then you can be glad for that, can\'t you?" sighed\r\nPollyanna, her eyes delightedly following a passing boat.\r\n\r\nThe man\'s lips parted indignantly, but no words came. Pollyanna was\r\nstill talking.\r\n\r\n"I wish _I_ didn\'t have anything to do but that. I have to go to\r\nschool. Oh, I like school; but there\'s such a whole lot of things I\r\nlike better. Still I\'m glad I CAN go to school. I\'m \'specially glad\r\nwhen I remember how last winter I didn\'t think I could ever go again.\r\nYou see, I lost my legs for a while--I mean, they didn\'t go; and you\r\nknow you never know how much you use things, till you don\'t have \'em.\r\nAnd eyes, too. Did you ever think what a lot you do with eyes? I\r\ndidn\'t till I went to the Sanatorium. There was a lady there who had\r\njust got blind the year before. I tried to get her to play the\r\ngame--finding something to be glad about, you know--but she said she\r\ncouldn\'t; and if I wanted to know why, I might tie up my eyes with my\r\nhandkerchief for just one hour. And I did. It was awful. Did you ever\r\ntry it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, n-no, I didn\'t." A half-vexed, half-baffled expression was\r\ncoming to the man\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Well, don\'t. It\'s awful. You can\'t do anything--not anything that you\r\nwant to do. But I kept it on the whole hour. Since then I\'ve been so\r\nglad, sometimes--when I see something perfectly lovely like this, you\r\nknow--I\'ve been so glad I wanted to cry;--\'cause I COULD see it, you\r\nknow. She\'s playing the game now, though--that blind lady is. Miss\r\nWetherby told me."\r\n\r\n"The--GAME?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; the glad game. Didn\'t I tell you? Finding something in\r\neverything to be glad about. Well, she\'s found it now--about her eyes,\r\nyou know. Her husband is the kind of a man that goes to help make the\r\nlaws, and she had him ask for one that would help blind people,\r\n\'specially little babies. And she went herself and talked and told\r\nthose men how it felt to be blind. And they made it--that law. And\r\nthey said that she did more than anybody else, even her husband, to\r\nhelp make it, and that they didn\'t believe there would have been any\r\nlaw at all if it hadn\'t been for her. So now she says she\'s glad she\r\nlost her eyes, \'cause she\'s kept so many little babies from growing up\r\nto be blind like her. So you see she\'s playing it--the game. But I\r\nreckon you don\'t know about the game yet, after all; so I\'ll tell you.\r\nIt started this way." And Pollyanna, with her eyes on the shimmering\r\nbeauty all about her, told of the little pair of crutches of long ago,\r\nwhich should have been a doll.\r\n\r\nWhen the story was finished there was a long silence; then, a little\r\nabruptly the man got to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Oh, are you going away NOW?" she asked in open disappointment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m going now." He smiled down at her a little queerly.\r\n\r\n"But you\'re coming back sometime?"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head--but again he smiled.\r\n\r\n"I hope not--and I believe not, little girl. You see, I\'ve made a\r\ngreat discovery to-day. I thought I was down and out. I thought there\r\nwas no place for me anywhere--now. But I\'ve just discovered that I\'ve\r\ngot two eyes, two arms, and two legs. Now I\'m going to use them--and\r\nI\'m going to MAKE somebody understand that I know how to use them!"\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was gone.\r\n\r\n"Why, what a funny man!" mused Pollyanna. "Still, he was nice--and he\r\nwas different, too," she finished, rising to her feet and resuming her\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was now once more her usual cheerful self, and she stepped\r\nwith the confident assurance of one who has no doubt. Had not the man\r\nsaid that this was a public park, and that she had as good a right as\r\nanybody to be there? She walked nearer to the pond and crossed the\r\nbridge to the starting-place of the little boats. For some time she\r\nwatched the children happily, keeping a particularly sharp lookout for\r\nthe possible black curls of Susie Smith. She would have liked to take\r\na ride in the pretty boats, herself, but the sign said "Five cents" a\r\ntrip, and she did not have any money with her. She smiled hopefully\r\ninto the faces of several women, and twice she spoke tentatively. But\r\nno one spoke first to her, and those whom she addressed eyed her\r\ncoldly, and made scant response.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she turned her steps into still another path. Here she\r\nfound a white-faced boy in a wheel chair. She would have spoken to\r\nhim, but he was so absorbed in his book that she turned away after a\r\nmoment\'s wistful gazing. Soon then she came upon a pretty, but\r\nsad-looking young girl sitting alone, staring at nothing, very much as\r\nthe man had sat. With a contented little cry Pollyanna hurried\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how do you do?" she beamed. "I\'m so glad I found you! I\'ve been\r\nhunting ever so long for you," she asserted, dropping herself down on\r\nthe unoccupied end of the bench.\r\n\r\nThe pretty girl turned with a start, an eager look of expectancy in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" she exclaimed, falling back in plain disappointment. "I\r\nthought-- Why, what do you mean?" she demanded aggrievedly. "I never\r\nset eyes on you before in my life."\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t you, either," smiled Pollyanna; "but I\'ve been hunting\r\nfor you, just the same. That is, of course I didn\'t know you were\r\ngoing to be YOU exactly. It\'s just that I wanted to find some one that\r\nlooked lonesome, and that didn\'t have anybody. Like me, you know. So\r\nmany here to-day have got folks. See?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see," nodded the girl, falling back into her old listlessness.\r\n"But, poor little kid, it\'s too bad YOU should find it out--so soon."\r\n\r\n"Find what out?"\r\n\r\n"That the lonesomest place in all the world is in a crowd in a big\r\ncity."\r\n\r\nPollyanna frowned and pondered.\r\n\r\n"Is it? I don\'t see how it can be. I don\'t see how you can be lonesome\r\nwhen you\'ve got folks all around you. Still--" she hesitated, and the\r\nfrown deepened. "I WAS lonesome this afternoon, and there WERE folks\r\nall around me; only they didn\'t seem to--to think--or notice."\r\n\r\nThe pretty girl smiled bitterly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. They don\'t ever think--or notice, crowds don\'t."\r\n\r\n"But some folks do. We can be glad some do," urged Pollyanna. "Now\r\nwhen I--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, some do," interrupted the other. As she spoke she shivered\r\nand looked fearfully down the path beyond Pollyanna. "Some notice--too\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\nPollyanna shrank back in dismay. Repeated rebuffs that afternoon had\r\ngiven her a new sensitiveness.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean--me?" she stammered. "That you wished I\r\nhadn\'t--noticed--you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, kiddie! I meant--some one quite different from you. Some one\r\nthat hadn\'t ought to notice. I was glad to have you speak, only--I\r\nthought at first it was some one from home."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then you don\'t live here, either, any more than I do--I mean, for\r\nkeeps."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I live here now," sighed the girl; "that is, if you can call\r\nit living--what I do."\r\n\r\n"What do you do?" asked Pollyanna interestedly.\r\n\r\n"Do? I\'ll tell you what I do," cried the other, with sudden\r\nbitterness. "From morning till night I sell fluffy laces and perky\r\nbows to girls that laugh and talk and KNOW each other. Then I go home\r\nto a little back room up three flights just big enough to hold a lumpy\r\ncot-bed, a washstand with a nicked pitcher, one rickety chair, and me.\r\nIt\'s like a furnace in the summer and an ice box in the winter; but\r\nit\'s all the place I\'ve got, and I\'m supposed to stay in it--when I\r\nain\'t workin\'. But I\'ve come out to-day. I ain\'t goin\' to stay in that\r\nroom, and I ain\'t goin\' to go to any old library to read, neither.\r\nIt\'s our last half-holiday this year--and an extra one, at that; and\r\nI\'m going to have a good time--for once. I\'m just as young, and I like\r\nto laugh and joke just as well as them girls I sell bows to all day.\r\nWell, to-day I\'m going to laugh and joke."\r\n\r\nPollyanna smiled and nodded her approval.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you feel that way. I do, too. It\'s a lot more fun--to be\r\nhappy, isn\'t it? Besides, the Bible tells us to;--rejoice and be glad,\r\nI mean. It tells us to eight hundred times. Probably you know about\r\n\'em, though--the rejoicing texts."\r\n\r\nThe pretty girl shook her head. A queer look came to her face.\r\n\r\n"Well, no," she said dryly. "I can\'t say I WAS thinkin\'--of the\r\nBible."\r\n\r\n"Weren\'t you? Well, maybe not; but, you see, MY father was a minister,\r\nand he--"\r\n\r\n"A MINISTER?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Why, was yours, too?" cried Pollyanna, answering something she\r\nsaw in the other\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Y-yes." A faint color crept up to the girl\'s forehead.\r\n\r\n"Oh, and has he gone like mine to be with God and the angels?"\r\n\r\nThe girl turned away her head.\r\n\r\n"No. He\'s still living--back home," she answered, half under her\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how glad you must be," sighed Pollyanna, enviously. "Sometimes I\r\nget to thinking, if only I could just SEE father once--but you do see\r\nyour father, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Not often. You see, I\'m down--here."\r\n\r\n"But you CAN see him--and I can\'t, mine. He\'s gone to be with mother\r\nand the rest of us up in Heaven, and-- Have you got a mother, too--an\r\nearth mother?"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes." The girl stirred restlessly, and half moved as if to go.\r\n\r\n"Oh, then you can see both of them," breathed Pollyanna, unutterable\r\nlonging in her face. "Oh, how glad you must be! For there just isn\'t\r\nanybody, is there, that really CARES and notices quite so much as\r\nfathers and mothers. You see I know, for I had a father until I was\r\neleven years old; but, for a mother, I had Ladies\' Aiders for ever so\r\nlong, till Aunt Polly took me. Ladies\' Aiders are lovely, but of\r\ncourse they aren\'t like mothers, or even Aunt Pollys; and--"\r\n\r\nOn and on Pollyanna talked. Pollyanna was in her element now.\r\nPollyanna loved to talk. That there was anything strange or unwise or\r\neven unconventional in this intimate telling of her thoughts and her\r\nhistory to a total stranger on a Boston park bench did not once occur\r\nto Pollyanna. To Pollyanna all men, women, and children were friends,\r\neither known or unknown; and thus far she had found the unknown quite\r\nas delightful as the known, for with them there was always the\r\nexcitement of mystery and adventure--while they were changing from the\r\nunknown to the known.\r\n\r\nTo this young girl at her side, therefore, Pollyanna talked\r\nunreservedly of her father, her Aunt Polly, her Western home, and her\r\njourney East to Vermont. She told of new friends and old friends, and\r\nof course she told of the game. Pollyanna almost always told everybody\r\nof the game, either sooner or later. It was, indeed, so much a part of\r\nher very self that she could hardly have helped telling of it.\r\n\r\nAs for the girl--she said little. She was not now sitting in her old\r\nlistless attitude, however, and to her whole self had come a marked\r\nchange. The flushed cheeks, frowning brow, troubled eyes, and\r\nnervously working fingers were plainly the signs of some inward\r\nstruggle. From time to time she glanced apprehensively down the path\r\nbeyond Pollyanna, and it was after such a glance that she clutched the\r\nlittle girl\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"See here, kiddie, for just a minute don\'t you leave me. Do you hear?\r\nStay right where you are? There\'s a man I know comin\'; but no matter\r\nwhat he says, don\'t you pay no attention, and DON\'T YOU GO. I\'m goin\'\r\nto stay with YOU. See?"\r\n\r\nBefore Pollyanna could more than gasp her wonderment and surprise, she\r\nfound herself looking up into the face of a very handsome young\r\ngentleman, who had stopped before them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, here you are," he smiled pleasantly, lifting his hat to\r\nPollyanna\'s companion. "I\'m afraid I\'ll have to begin with an\r\napology--I\'m a little late."\r\n\r\n"It don\'t matter, sir," said the young girl, speaking hurriedly.\r\n"I--I\'ve decided not to go."\r\n\r\nThe young man gave a light laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, my clear, don\'t be hard on a chap because he\'s a little\r\nlate!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that, really," defended the girl, a swift red flaming into\r\nher cheeks. "I mean--I\'m not going."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" The man stopped smiling. He spoke sharply. "You said\r\nyesterday you\'d go."\r\n\r\n"I know; but I\'ve changed my mind. I told my little friend here--I\'d\r\nstay with her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but if you\'d rather go with this nice young gentleman," began\r\nPollyanna, anxiously; but she fell back silenced at the look the girl\r\ngave her.\r\n\r\n"I tell you I had NOT rather go. I\'m not going."\r\n\r\n"And, pray, why this sudden right-about face?" demanded the young man\r\nwith an expression that made him suddenly look, to Pollyanna, not\r\nquite so handsome. "Yesterday you said--"\r\n\r\n"I know I did," interrupted the girl, feverishly. "But I knew then\r\nthat I hadn\'t ought to. Let\'s call it--that I know it even better now.\r\nThat\'s all." And she turned away resolutely.\r\n\r\nIt was not all. The man spoke again, twice. He coaxed, then he sneered\r\nwith a hateful look in his eyes. At last he said something very low\r\nand angry, which Pollyanna did not understand. The next moment he\r\nwheeled about and strode away.\r\n\r\nThe girl watched him tensely till he passed quite out of sight, then,\r\nrelaxing, she laid a shaking hand on Pollyanna\'s arm.\r\n\r\n"Thanks, kiddie. I reckon I owe you--more than you know. Good-by."\r\n\r\n"But you aren\'t going away NOW!" bemoaned Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nThe girl sighed wearily.\r\n\r\n"I got to. He might come back, and next time I might not be able to--"\r\nShe clipped the words short and rose to her feet. For a moment she\r\nhesitated, then she choked bitterly: "You see, he\'s the kind\r\nthat--notices too much, and that hadn\'t ought to notice--ME--at all!"\r\nWith that she was gone.\r\n\r\n"Why, what a funny lady," murmured Pollyanna, looking wistfully after\r\nthe vanishing figure. "She was nice, but she was sort of different,\r\ntoo," she commented, rising to her feet and moving idly down the path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nJERRY TO THE RESCUE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Pollyanna reached the edge of the Garden at a\r\ncorner where two streets crossed. It was a wonderfully interesting\r\ncorner, with its hurrying cars, automobiles, carriages and\r\npedestrians. A huge red bottle in a drug-store window caught her eye,\r\nand from down the street came the sound of a hurdy-gurdy. Hesitating\r\nonly a moment Pollyanna darted across the corner and skipped lightly\r\ndown the street toward the entrancing music.\r\n\r\nPollyanna found much to interest her now. In the store windows were\r\nmarvelous objects, and around the hurdy-gurdy, when she had reached\r\nit, she found a dozen dancing children, most fascinating to watch. So\r\naltogether delightful, indeed, did this pastime prove to be that\r\nPollyanna followed the hurdy-gurdy for some distance, just to see\r\nthose children dance. Presently she found herself at a corner so busy\r\nthat a very big man in a belted blue coat helped the people across the\r\nstreet. For an absorbed minute she watched him in silence; then, a\r\nlittle timidly, she herself started to cross.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful experience. The big, blue-coated man saw her at\r\nonce and promptly beckoned to her. He even walked to meet her. Then,\r\nthrough a wide lane with puffing motors and impatient horses on either\r\nhand, she walked unscathed to the further curb. It gave her a\r\ndelightful sensation, so delightful that, after a minute, she walked\r\nback. Twice again, after short intervals, she trod the fascinating way\r\nso magically opened at the lifting of the big man\'s hand. But the last\r\ntime her conductor left her at the curb, he gave a puzzled frown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Twice again, after short intervals, she trod the\r\nfascinating way"]\r\n\r\n"See here, little girl, ain\'t you the same one what crossed a minute\r\nago?" he demanded. "And again before that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," beamed Pollyanna. "I\'ve been across four times!"\r\n\r\n"Well!" the officer began to bluster; but Pollyanna was still talking.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s been nicer every time!"\r\n\r\n"Oh-h, it has--has it?" mumbled the big man, lamely. Then, with a\r\nlittle more spirit he sputtered: "What do you think I\'m here for--just\r\nto tote you back and forth?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir," dimpled Pollyanna. "Of course you aren\'t just for me!\r\nThere are all these others. I know what you are. You\'re a policeman.\r\nWe\'ve got one of you out where I live at Mrs. Carew\'s, only he\'s the\r\nkind that just walks on the sidewalk, you know. I used to think you\r\nwere soldiers, on account of your gold buttons and blue hats; but I\r\nknow better now. Only I think you ARE a kind of a soldier, \'cause\r\nyou\'re so brave--standing here like this, right in the middle of all\r\nthese teams and automobiles, helping folks across."\r\n\r\n"Ho--ho! Brrrr!" spluttered the big man, coloring like a schoolboy and\r\nthrowing back his head with a hearty laugh. "Ho--ho! Just as if--" He\r\nbroke off with a quick lifting of his hand. The next moment he was\r\nescorting a plainly very much frightened little old lady from curb to\r\ncurb. If his step were a bit more pompous, and his chest a bit more\r\nfull, it must have been only an unconscious tribute to the watching\r\neyes of the little girl back at the starting-point. A moment later,\r\nwith a haughtily permissive wave of his hand toward the chafing\r\ndrivers and chauffeurs, he strolled back to Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was splendid!" she greeted him, with shining eyes. "I love\r\nto see you do it--and it\'s just like the Children of Israel crossing\r\nthe Red Sea, isn\'t it?--with you holding back the waves for the people\r\nto cross. And how glad you must be all the time, that you can do it! I\r\nused to think being a doctor was the very gladdest business there was,\r\nbut I reckon, after all, being a policeman is gladder yet--to help\r\nfrightened people like this, you know. And--" But with another\r\n"Brrrr!" and an embarrassed laugh, the big blue-coated man was back in\r\nthe middle of the street, and Pollyanna was all alone on the\r\ncurbstone.\r\n\r\nFor only a minute longer did Pollyanna watch her fascinating "Red\r\nSea," then, with a regretful backward glance, she turned away.\r\n\r\n"I reckon maybe I\'d better be going home now," she meditated. "It must\r\nbe \'most dinner time." And briskly she started to walk back by the way\r\nshe had come.\r\n\r\nNot until she had hesitated at several corners, and unwittingly made\r\ntwo false turns, did Pollyanna grasp the fact that "going back home"\r\nwas not to be so easy as she had thought it to be. And not until she\r\ncame to a building which she knew she had never seen before, did she\r\nfully realize that she had lost her way.\r\n\r\nShe was on a narrow street, dirty, and ill-paved. Dingy tenement\r\nblocks and a few unattractive stores were on either side. All about\r\nwere jabbering men and chattering women--though not one word of what\r\nthey said could Pollyanna understand. Moreover, she could not help\r\nseeing that the people looked at her very curiously, as if they knew\r\nshe did not belong there.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, already, she had asked her way, but in vain. No one\r\nseemed to know where Mrs. Carew lived; and, the last two times, those\r\naddressed had answered with a gesture and a jumble of words which\r\nPollyanna, after some thought, decided must be "Dutch," the kind the\r\nHaggermans--the only foreign family in Beldingsville--used.\r\n\r\nOn and on, down one street and up another, Pollyanna trudged. She was\r\nthoroughly frightened now. She was hungry, too, and very tired. Her\r\nfeet ached, and her eyes smarted with the tears she was trying so hard\r\nto hold back. Worse yet, it was unmistakably beginning to grow dark.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow," she choked to herself, "I\'m going to be glad I\'m lost,\r\n\'cause it\'ll be so nice when I get found. I CAN be glad for that!"\r\n\r\nIt was at a noisy corner where two broader streets crossed that\r\nPollyanna finally came to a dismayed stop. This time the tears quite\r\noverflowed, so that, lacking a handkerchief, she had to use the backs\r\nof both hands to wipe them away.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, kid, why the weeps?" queried a cheery voice. "What\'s up?"\r\n\r\nWith a relieved little cry Pollyanna turned to confront a small boy\r\ncarrying a bundle of newspapers under his arm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m so glad to see you!" she exclaimed. "I\'ve so wanted to see\r\nsome one who didn\'t talk Dutch!"\r\n\r\nThe small boy grinned.\r\n\r\n"Dutch nothin\'!" he scoffed. "You mean Dago, I bet ye."\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a slight frown.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, it--it wasn\'t English," she said doubtfully; "and they\r\ncouldn\'t answer my questions. But maybe you can. Do you know where\r\nMrs. Carew lives?"\r\n\r\n"Nix! You can search me."\r\n\r\n"Wha-at?" queried Pollyanna, still more doubtfully.\r\n\r\nThe boy grinned again.\r\n\r\n"I say not in mine. I guess I ain\'t acquainted with the lady."\r\n\r\n"But isn\'t there anybody anywhere that is?" implored Pollyanna. "You\r\nsee, I just went out for a walk and I got lost. I\'ve been ever and\r\never so far, but I can\'t find the house at all; and it\'s supper--I\r\nmean dinner time and getting dark. I want to get back. I MUST get\r\nback."\r\n\r\n"Gee! Well, I should worry!" sympathized the boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I\'m afraid Mrs. Carew\'ll worry, too," sighed Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Gorry! if you ain\'t the limit," chuckled the youth, unexpectedly.\r\n"But, say, listen! Don\'t ye know the name of the street ye want?"\r\n\r\n"No--only that it\'s some kind of an avenue," desponded Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"A avenOO, is it? Sure, now, some class to that! We\'re doin\' fine.\r\nWhat\'s the number of the house? Can ye tell me that? Just scratch your\r\nhead!"\r\n\r\n"Scratch--my--head?" Pollyanna frowned questioningly, and raised a\r\ntentative hand to her hair.\r\n\r\nThe boy eyed her with disdain.\r\n\r\n"Aw, come off yer perch! Ye ain\'t so dippy as all that. I say, don\'t\r\nye know the number of the house ye want?"\r\n\r\n"N-no, except there\'s a seven in it," returned Pollyanna, with a\r\nfaintly hopeful air.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t ye listen ter that?" gibed the scornful youth. "There\'s a seven\r\nin it--an\' she expects me ter know it when I see it!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I should know the house, if I could only see it," declared\r\nPollyanna, eagerly; "and I think I\'d know the street, too, on account\r\nof the lovely long yard running right up and down through the middle\r\nof it."\r\n\r\nThis time it was the boy who gave a puzzled frown.\r\n\r\n"YARD?" he queried, "in the middle of a street?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--trees and grass, you know, with a walk in the middle of it, and\r\nseats, and--" But the boy interrupted her with a whoop of delight.\r\n\r\n"Gee whiz! Commonwealth Avenue, sure as yer livin\'! Wouldn\'t that get\r\nyer goat, now?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do you know--do you, really?" besought Pollyanna. "That sounded\r\nlike it--only I don\'t know what you meant about the goat part. There\r\naren\'t any goats there. I don\'t think they\'d allow--"\r\n\r\n"Goats nothin\'!" scoffed the boy. "You bet yer sweet life I know where\r\n\'tis! Don\'t I tote Sir James up there to the Garden \'most ev\'ry day?\r\nAn\' I\'ll take YOU, too. Jest ye hang out here till I get on ter my job\r\nagain, an\' sell out my stock. Then we\'ll make tracks for that \'ere\r\nAvenue \'fore ye can say Jack Robinson."\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'ll take me--home?" appealed Pollyanna, still plainly not\r\nquite understanding.\r\n\r\n"Sure! It\'s a cinch--if you know the house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I know the house," replied the literal Pollyanna, anxiously,\r\n"but I don\'t know whether it\'s a--a cinch, or not. If it isn\'t, can\'t\r\nyou--"\r\n\r\nBut the boy only threw her another disdainful glance and darted off\r\ninto the thick of the crowd. A moment later Pollyanna heard his\r\nstrident call of "paper, paper! Herald, Globe,--paper, sir?"\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of relief Pollyanna stepped back into a doorway and\r\nwaited. She was tired, but she was happy. In spite of sundry puzzling\r\naspects of the case, she yet trusted the boy, and she had perfect\r\nconfidence that he could take her home.\r\n\r\n"He\'s nice, and I like him," she said to herself, following with her\r\neyes the boy\'s alert, darting figure. "But he does talk funny. His\r\nwords SOUND English, but some of them don\'t seem to make any sense\r\nwith the rest of what he says. But then, I\'m glad he found me,\r\nanyway," she finished with a contented little sigh.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the boy returned, his hands empty.\r\n\r\n"Come on, kid. All aboard," he called cheerily. "Now we\'ll hit the\r\ntrail for the Avenue. If I was the real thing, now, I\'d tote ye home\r\nin style in a buzzwagon; but seein\' as how I hain\'t got the dough,\r\nwe\'ll have ter hoof it."\r\n\r\nIt was, for the most part, a silent walk. Pollyanna, for once in her\r\nlife, was too tired to talk, even of the Ladies\' Aiders; and the boy\r\nwas intent on picking out the shortest way to his goal. When the\r\nPublic Garden was reached, Pollyanna did exclaim joyfully:\r\n\r\n"Oh, now I\'m \'most there! I remember this place. I had a perfectly\r\nlovely time here this afternoon. It\'s only a little bit of a ways home\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the stuff! Now we\'re gettin\' there," crowed the boy. "What\'d I\r\ntell ye? We\'ll just cut through here to the Avenue, an\' then it\'ll be\r\nup ter you ter find the house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can find the house," exulted Pollyanna, with all the confidence\r\nof one who has reached familiar ground.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark when Pollyanna led the way up the broad Carew steps.\r\nThe boy\'s ring at the bell was very quickly answered, and Pollyanna\r\nfound herself confronted by not only Mary, but by Mrs. Carew, Bridget,\r\nand Jennie as well. All four of the women were white-faced and\r\nanxious-eyed.\r\n\r\n"Child, child, where HAVE you been?" demanded Mrs. Carew, hurrying\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n"Why, I--I just went to walk," began Pollyanna, "and I got lost, and\r\nthis boy--"\r\n\r\n"Where did you find her?" cut in Mrs. Carew, turning imperiously to\r\nPollyanna\'s escort, who was, at the moment, gazing in frank admiration\r\nat the wonders about him in the brilliantly-lighted hall.\r\n\r\n"Where did you find her, boy?" she repeated sharply.\r\n\r\nFor a brief moment the boy met her gaze unflinchingly; then something\r\nvery like a twinkle came into his eyes, though his voice, when he\r\nspoke, was gravity itself.\r\n\r\n"Well, I found her \'round Bowdoin Square, but I reckon she\'d been\r\ndoin\' the North End, only she couldn\'t catch on ter the lingo of the\r\nDagos, so I don\'t think she give \'em the glad hand, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"The North End--that child--alone! Pollyanna!" shuddered Mrs. Carew.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wasn\'t alone, Mrs. Carew," fended Pollyanna. "There were ever\r\nand ever so many people there, weren\'t there, boy?"\r\n\r\nBut the boy, with an impish grin, was disappearing through the door.\r\n\r\nPollyanna learned many things during the next half-hour. She learned\r\nthat nice little girls do not take long walks alone in unfamiliar\r\ncities, nor sit on park benches and talk to strangers. She learned,\r\nalso, that it was only by a "perfectly marvelous miracle" that she had\r\nreached home at all that night, and that she had escaped many, many\r\nvery disagreeable consequences of her foolishness. She learned that\r\nBoston was not Beldingsville, and that she must not think it was.\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Carew," she finally argued despairingly, "I AM here, and I\r\ndidn\'t get lost for keeps. Seems as if I ought to be glad for that\r\ninstead of thinking all the time of the sorry things that might have\r\nhappened."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, child, I suppose so, I suppose so," sighed Mrs. Carew; "but\r\nyou have given me such a fright, and I want you to be sure, SURE, SURE\r\nnever to do it again. Now come, dear, you must be hungry."\r\n\r\nIt was just as she was dropping off to sleep that night that Pollyanna\r\nmurmured drowsily to herself:\r\n\r\n"The thing I\'m the very sorriest for of anything is that I didn\'t ask\r\nthat boy his name nor where he lived. Now I can\'t ever say thank you\r\nto him!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA NEW ACQUAINTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nPollyanna\'s movements were most carefully watched over after her\r\nadventurous walk; and, except to go to school, she was not allowed out\r\nof the house unless Mary or Mrs. Carew herself accompanied her. This,\r\nto Pollyanna, however, was no cross, for she loved both Mrs. Carew and\r\nMary, and delighted to be with them. They were, too, for a while, very\r\ngenerous with their time. Even Mrs. Carew, in her terror of what might\r\nhave happened, and her relief that it had not happened, exerted\r\nherself to entertain the child.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that, with Mrs. Carew, Pollyanna attended concerts\r\nand matinees, and visited the Public Library and the Art Museum; and\r\nwith Mary she took the wonderful "seeing Boston" trips, and visited\r\nthe State House and the Old South Church.\r\n\r\nGreatly as Pollyanna enjoyed the automobile, she enjoyed the trolley\r\ncars more, as Mrs. Carew, much to her surprise, found out one day.\r\n\r\n"Do we go in the trolley car?" Pollyanna asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"No. Perkins will take us," answered Mrs. Carew. Then, at the\r\nunmistakable disappointment in Pollyanna\'s face, she added in\r\nsurprise: "Why, I thought you liked the auto, child!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do," acceded Pollyanna, hurriedly; "and I wouldn\'t say\r\nanything, anyway, because of course I know it\'s cheaper than the\r\ntrolley car, and--"\r\n\r\n"\'Cheaper than the trolley car\'!" exclaimed Mrs. Carew, amazed into an\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes," explained Pollyanna, with widening eyes; "the trolley car\r\ncosts five cents a person, you know, and the auto doesn\'t cost\r\nanything, \'cause it\'s yours. And of course I LOVE the auto, anyway,"\r\nshe hurried on, before Mrs. Carew could speak. "It\'s only that there\r\nare so many more people in the trolley car, and it\'s such fun to watch\r\nthem! Don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no, Pollyanna, I can\'t say that I do," responded Mrs. Carew,\r\ndryly, as she turned away.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced, not two days later, Mrs. Carew heard something more of\r\nPollyanna and trolley cars--this time from Mary.\r\n\r\n"I mean, it\'s queer, ma\'am," explained Mary earnestly, in answer to a\r\nquestion her mistress had asked, "it\'s queer how Miss Pollyanna just\r\ngets \'round EVERYBODY--and without half trying. It isn\'t that she DOES\r\nanything. She doesn\'t. She just--just looks glad, I guess, that\'s all.\r\nBut I\'ve seen her get into a trolley car that was full of\r\ncross-looking men and women, and whimpering children, and in five\r\nminutes you wouldn\'t know the place. The men and women have stopped\r\nscowling, and the children have forgot what they\'re cryin\' for.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes it\'s just somethin\' that Miss Pollyanna has said to me, and\r\nthey\'ve heard it. Sometimes it\'s just the \'Thank you,\' she gives when\r\nsomebody insists on givin\' us their seat--and they\'re always doin\'\r\nthat--givin\' us seats, I mean. And sometimes it\'s the way she smiles\r\nat a baby or a dog. All dogs everywhere wag their tails at her,\r\nanyway, and all babies, big and little, smile and reach out to her. If\r\nwe get held up it\'s a joke, and if we take the wrong car, it\'s the\r\nfunniest thing that ever happened. And that\'s the way \'tis about\r\neverythin\'. One just can\'t stay grumpy, with Miss Pollyanna, even if\r\nyou\'re only one of a trolley car full of folks that don\'t know her."\r\n\r\n"Hm-m; very likely," murmured Mrs. Carew, turning away.\r\n\r\nOctober proved to be, that year, a particularly warm, delightful\r\nmonth, and as the golden days came and went, it was soon very evident\r\nthat to keep up with Pollyanna\'s eager little feet was a task which\r\nwould consume altogether too much of somebody\'s time and patience;\r\nand, while Mrs. Carew had the one, she had not the other, neither had\r\nshe the willingness to allow Mary to spend quite so much of HER time\r\n(whatever her patience might be) in dancing attendance to Pollyanna\'s\r\nwhims and fancies.\r\n\r\nTo keep the child indoors all through those glorious October\r\nafternoons was, of course, out of the question. Thus it came about\r\nthat, before long, Pollyanna found herself once more in the "lovely\r\nbig yard"--the Boston Public Garden--and alone. Apparently she was as\r\nfree as before, but in reality she was surrounded by a high stone wall\r\nof regulations.\r\n\r\nShe must not talk to strange men or women; she must not play with\r\nstrange children; and under no circumstances must she step foot\r\noutside the Garden except to come home. Furthermore, Mary, who had\r\ntaken her to the Garden and left her, made very sure that she knew the\r\nway home--that she knew just where Commonwealth Avenue came down to\r\nArlington Street across from the Garden. And always she must go home\r\nwhen the clock in the church tower said it was half-past four.\r\n\r\nPollyanna went often to the Garden after this. Occasionally she went\r\nwith some of the girls from school. More often she went alone. In\r\nspite of the somewhat irksome restrictions she enjoyed herself very\r\nmuch. She could WATCH the people even if she could not talk to them;\r\nand she could talk to the squirrels and pigeons and sparrows that so\r\neagerly came for the nuts and grain which she soon learned to carry to\r\nthem every time she went.\r\n\r\nPollyanna often looked for her old friends of that first day--the man\r\nwho was so glad he had his eyes and legs and arms, and the pretty\r\nyoung lady who would not go with the handsome man; but she never saw\r\nthem. She did frequently see the boy in the wheel chair, and she\r\nwished she could talk to him. The boy fed the birds and squirrels,\r\ntoo, and they were so tame that the doves would perch on his head and\r\nshoulders, and the squirrels would burrow in his pockets for nuts. But\r\nPollyanna, watching from a distance, always noticed one strange\r\ncircumstance: in spite of the boy\'s very evident delight in serving\r\nhis banquet, his supply of food always ran short almost at once; and\r\nthough he invariably looked fully as disappointed as did the squirrel\r\nafter a nutless burrowing, yet he never remedied the matter by\r\nbringing more food the next day--which seemed most short-sighted to\r\nPollyanna.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy was not playing with the birds and squirrels he was\r\nreading--always reading. In his chair were usually two or three worn\r\nbooks, and sometimes a magazine or two. He was nearly always to be\r\nfound in one especial place, and Pollyanna used to wonder how he got\r\nthere. Then, one unforgettable day, she found out. It was a school\r\nholiday, and she had come to the Garden in the forenoon; and it was\r\nsoon after she reached the place that she saw him being wheeled along\r\none of the paths by a snub-nosed, sandy-haired boy. She gave a keen\r\nglance into the sandy-haired boy\'s face, then ran toward him with a\r\nglad little cry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you--you! I know you--even if I don\'t know your name. You found\r\nme! Don\'t you remember? Oh, I\'m so glad to see you! I\'ve so wanted to\r\nsay thank you!"\r\n\r\n"Gee, if it ain\'t the swell little lost kid of the AveNOO!" grinned\r\nthe boy. "Well, what do you know about that! Lost again?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" exclaimed Pollyanna, dancing up and down on her toes in\r\nirrepressible joy. "I can\'t get lost any more--I have to stay right\r\nhere. And I mustn\'t talk, you know. But I can to you, for I KNOW you;\r\nand I can to him--after you introduce me," she finished, with a\r\nbeaming glance at the lame boy, and a hopeful pause.\r\n\r\nThe sandy-haired youth chuckled softly, and tapped the shoulder of the\r\nboy in the chair.\r\n\r\n"Listen ter that, will ye? Ain\'t that the real thing, now? Just you\r\nwait while I introDOOCE ye!" And he struck a pompous attitude. "Madam,\r\nthis is me friend, Sir James, Lord of Murphy\'s Alley, and--" But the\r\nboy in the chair interrupted him.\r\n\r\n"Jerry, quit your nonsense!" he cried vexedly. Then to Pollyanna he\r\nturned a glowing face. "I\'ve seen you here lots of times before. I\'ve\r\nwatched you feed the birds and squirrels--you always have such a lot\r\nfor them! And I think YOU like Sir Lancelot the best, too. Of course,\r\nthere\'s the Lady Rowena--but wasn\'t she rude to Guinevere\r\nyesterday--snatching her dinner right away from her like that?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna blinked and frowned, looking from one to the other of the\r\nboys in plain doubt. Jerry chuckled again. Then, with a final push he\r\nwheeled the chair into its usual position, and turned to go. Over his\r\nshoulder he called to Pollyanna:\r\n\r\n"Say, kid, jest let me put ye wise ter somethin\'. This chap ain\'t\r\ndrunk nor crazy. See? Them\'s jest names he\'s give his young friends\r\nhere,"--with a flourish of his arms toward the furred and feathered\r\ncreatures that were gathering from all directions. "An\' they ain\'t\r\neven names of FOLKS. They\'re just guys out of books. Are ye on? Yet\r\nhe\'d ruther feed them than feed hisself. Ain\'t he the limit? Ta-ta,\r\nSir James," he added, with a grimace, to the boy in the chair. "Buck\r\nup, now--nix on the no grub racket for you! See you later." And he was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was still blinking and frowning when the lame boy turned\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n"You mustn\'t mind Jerry. That\'s just his way. He\'d cut off his right\r\nhand for me--Jerry would; but he loves to tease. Where\'d you see him?\r\nDoes he know you? He didn\'t tell me your name."\r\n\r\n"I\'m Pollyanna Whittier. I was lost and he found me and took me home,"\r\nanswered Pollyanna, still a little dazedly.\r\n\r\n"I see. Just like him," nodded the boy. "Don\'t he tote me up here\r\nevery day?"\r\n\r\nA quick sympathy came to Pollyanna\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you walk--at all--er--Sir J-James?"\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed gleefully.\r\n\r\n"\'Sir James,\' indeed! That\'s only more of Jerry\'s nonsense. I ain\'t a\r\n\'Sir.\'"\r\n\r\nPollyanna looked clearly disappointed.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t? Nor a--a lord, like he said?"\r\n\r\n"I sure ain\'t."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hoped you were--like Little Lord Fauntleroy, you know,"\r\nrejoined Pollyanna. "And--"\r\n\r\nBut the boy interrupted her with an eager:\r\n\r\n"Do YOU know Little Lord Fauntleroy? And do you know about Sir\r\nLancelot, and the Holy Grail, and King Arthur and his Round Table, and\r\nthe Lady Rowena, and Ivanhoe, and all those? DO you?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave her head a dubious shake.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m afraid maybe I don\'t know ALL of \'em," she admitted. "Are\r\nthey all--in books?"\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got \'em here--some of \'em," he said. "I like to read \'em over\r\nand over. There\'s always SOMETHING new in \'em. Besides, I hain\'t got\r\nno others, anyway. These were father\'s. Here, you little rascal--quit\r\nthat!" he broke off in laughing reproof as a bushy-tailed squirrel\r\nleaped to his lap and began to nose in his pockets. "Gorry, guess we\'d\r\nbetter give them their dinner or they\'ll be tryin\' to eat us,"\r\nchuckled the boy. "That\'s Sir Lancelot. He\'s always first, you know."\r\n\r\nFrom somewhere the boy produced a small pasteboard box which he opened\r\nguardedly, mindful of the numberless bright little eyes that were\r\nwatching every move. All about him now sounded the whir and flutter of\r\nwings, the cooing of doves, the saucy twitter of the sparrows. Sir\r\nLancelot, alert and eager, occupied one arm of the wheel chair.\r\nAnother bushy-tailed little fellow, less venturesome, sat back on his\r\nhaunches five feet away. A third squirrel chattered noisily on a\r\nneighboring tree-branch.\r\n\r\nFrom the box the boy took a few nuts, a small roll, and a doughnut. At\r\nthe latter he looked longingly, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n"Did you--bring anything?" he asked then.\r\n\r\n"Lots--in here," nodded Pollyanna, tapping the paper bag she carried.\r\n\r\n"Oh, then perhaps I WILL eat it to-day," sighed the boy, dropping the\r\ndoughnut back into the box with an air of relief.\r\n\r\nPollyanna, on whom the significance of this action was quite lost,\r\nthrust her fingers into her own bag, and the banquet was on.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful hour. To Pollyanna it was, in a way, the most\r\nwonderful hour she had ever spent, for she had found some one who\r\ncould talk faster and longer than she could. This strange youth seemed\r\nto have an inexhaustible fund of marvelous stories of brave knights\r\nand fair ladies, of tournaments and battles. Moreover, so vividly did\r\nhe draw his pictures that Pollyanna saw with her own eyes the deeds of\r\nvalor, the knights in armor, and the fair ladies with their jeweled\r\ngowns and tresses, even though she was really looking at a flock of\r\nfluttering doves and sparrows and a group of frisking squirrels on a\r\nwide sweep of sunlit grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "It was a wonderful hour"]\r\n\r\nThe Ladies\' Aiders were forgotten. Even the glad game was not thought\r\nof. Pollyanna, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes was trailing\r\ndown the golden ages led by a romance-fed boy who--though she did not\r\nknow it--was trying to crowd into this one short hour of congenial\r\ncompanionship countless dreary days of loneliness and longing.\r\n\r\nNot until the noon bells sent Pollyanna hurrying homeward did she\r\nremember that she did not even yet know the boy\'s name.\r\n\r\n"I only know it isn\'t \'Sir James,\'" she sighed to herself, frowning\r\nwith vexation. "But never mind. I can ask him to-morrow."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nJAMIE\r\n\r\n\r\nPollyanna did not see the boy "to-morrow." It rained, and she could\r\nnot go to the Garden at all. It rained the next day, too. Even on the\r\nthird day she did not see him, for, though the sun came out bright and\r\nwarm, and though she went very early in the afternoon to the Garden\r\nand waited long, he did not come at all. But on the fourth day he was\r\nthere in his old place, and Pollyanna hastened forward with a joyous\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m so glad, GLAD to see you! But where\'ve you been? You weren\'t\r\nhere yesterday at all."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t. The pain wouldn\'t let me come yesterday," explained the\r\nlad, who was looking very white.\r\n\r\n"The PAIN! Oh, does it--ache?" stammered Pollyanna, all sympathy at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, always," nodded the boy, with a cheerfully matter-of-fact\r\nair. "Most generally I can stand it and come here just the same,\r\nexcept when it gets TOO bad, same as \'twas yesterday. Then I can\'t."\r\n\r\n"But how can you stand it--to have it ache--always?" gasped Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Why, I have to," answered the boy, opening his eyes a little wider.\r\n"Things that are so are SO, and they can\'t be any other way. So what\'s\r\nthe use thinking how they might be? Besides, the harder it aches one\r\nday, the nicer \'tis to have it let-up the next."\r\n\r\n"I know! That\'s like the ga--" began Pollyanna; but the boy\r\ninterrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Did you bring a lot this time?" he asked anxiously. "Oh, I hope you\r\ndid! You see I couldn\'t bring them any to-day. Jerry couldn\'t spare\r\neven a penny for peanuts this morning and there wasn\'t really enough\r\nstuff in the box for me this noon."\r\n\r\nPollyanna looked shocked.\r\n\r\n"You mean--that you didn\'t have enough to eat--yourself?--for YOUR\r\nluncheon?"\r\n\r\n"Sure!" smiled the boy. "But don\'t worry. Tisn\'t the first time--and\r\n\'twon\'t be the last. I\'m used to it. Hi, there! here comes Sir\r\nLancelot."\r\n\r\nPollyanna, however, was not thinking of squirrels.\r\n\r\n"And wasn\'t there any more at home?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, there\'s NEVER any left at home," laughed the boy. "You see,\r\nmumsey works out--stairs and washings--so she gets some of her feed in\r\nthem places, and Jerry picks his up where he can, except nights and\r\nmornings; he gets it with us then--if we\'ve got any."\r\n\r\nPollyanna looked still more shocked.\r\n\r\n"But what do you do when you don\'t have anything to eat?"\r\n\r\n"Go hungry, of course."\r\n\r\n"But I never HEARD of anybody who didn\'t have ANYTHING to eat," gasped\r\nPollyanna. "Of course father and I were poor, and we had to eat beans\r\nand fish balls when we wanted turkey. But we had SOMETHING. Why don\'t\r\nyou tell folks--all these folks everywhere, that live in these houses?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s the use?"\r\n\r\n"Why, they\'d give you something, of course!"\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed once more, this time a little queerly.\r\n\r\n"Guess again, kid. You\'ve got another one coming. Nobody I know is\r\ndishin\' out roast beef and frosted cakes for the askin\'. Besides, if\r\nyou didn\'t go hungry once in a while, you wouldn\'t know how good\r\n\'taters and milk can taste; and you wouldn\'t have so much to put in\r\nyour Jolly Book."\r\n\r\n"Your WHAT?"\r\n\r\nThe boy gave an embarrassed laugh and grew suddenly red.\r\n\r\n"Forget it! I didn\'t think, for a minute, but you was mumsey or\r\nJerry."\r\n\r\n"But what IS your Jolly Book?" pleaded Pollyanna. "Please tell me. Are\r\nthere knights and lords and ladies in that?"\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head. His eyes lost their laughter and grew dark and\r\nfathomless.\r\n\r\n"No; I wish\'t there was," he sighed wistfully. "But when you--you\r\ncan\'t even WALK, you can\'t fight battles and win trophies, and have\r\nfair ladies hand you your sword, and bestow upon you the golden\r\nguerdon." A sudden fire came to the boy\'s eyes. His chin lifted itself\r\nas if in response to a bugle call. Then, as suddenly, the fire died,\r\nand the boy fell back into his old listlessness.\r\n\r\n"You just can\'t do nothin\'," he resumed wearily, after a moment\'s\r\nsilence. "You just have to sit and think; and times like that your\r\nTHINK gets to be something awful. Mine did, anyhow. I wanted to go to\r\nschool and learn things--more things than just mumsey can teach me;\r\nand I thought of that. I wanted to run and play ball with the other\r\nboys; and I thought of that. I wanted to go out and sell papers with\r\nJerry; and I thought of that. I didn\'t want to be taken care of all my\r\nlife; and I thought of that."\r\n\r\n"I know, oh, I know," breathed Pollyanna, with shining eyes. "Didn\'t I\r\nlose MY legs for a while?"\r\n\r\n"Did you? Then you do know, some. But you\'ve got yours again. I\r\nhain\'t, you know," sighed the boy, the shadow in his eyes deepening.\r\n\r\n"But you haven\'t told me yet about--the Jolly Book," prompted\r\nPollyanna, after a minute.\r\n\r\nThe boy stirred and laughed shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, it ain\'t much, after all, except to me. YOU wouldn\'t\r\nsee much in it. I started it a year ago. I was feelin\' \'specially bad\r\nthat day. Nothin\' was right. For a while I grumped it out, just\r\nthinkin\'; and then I picked up one of father\'s books and tried to\r\nread. And the first thing I see was this: I learned it afterwards, so\r\nI can say it now.\r\n\r\n  "\'Pleasures lie thickest where no pleasures seem;\r\n  There\'s not a leaf that falls upon the ground\r\n  But holds some joy, of silence or of sound.\'\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Blanchard. Lyric Offerings. Hidden Joys.]\r\n\r\n"Well, I was mad. I wished I could put the guy that wrote that in my\r\nplace, and see what kind of joy he\'d find in my \'leaves.\' I was so mad\r\nI made up my mind I\'d prove he didn\'t know what he was talkin\' about,\r\nso I begun to hunt for \'em--the joys in my \'leaves,\' you know. I took\r\na little old empty notebook that Jerry had given me, and I said to\r\nmyself that I\'d write \'em down. Everythin\' that had anythin\' about it\r\nthat I liked I\'d put down in the book. Then I\'d just show how many\r\n\'joys\' I had."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" cried Pollyanna, absorbedly, as the boy paused for breath.\r\n\r\n"Well, I didn\'t expect to get many, but--do you know?--I got a lot.\r\nThere was somethin\' about \'most everythin\' that I liked a LITTLE, so\r\nin it had to go. The very first one was the book itself--that I\'d got\r\nit, you know, to write in. Then somebody give me a flower in a pot,\r\nand Jerry found a dandy book in the subway. After that it was really\r\nfun to hunt \'em out--I\'d find \'em in such queer places, sometimes.\r\nThen one day Jerry got hold of the little notebook, and found out what\r\n\'twas. Then he give it its name--the Jolly Book. And--and that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"All--ALL!" cried Pollyanna, delight and amazement struggling for the\r\nmastery on her glowing little face. "Why, that\'s the game! You\'re\r\nplaying the glad game, and don\'t know it--only you\'re playing it ever\r\nand ever so much better than I ever could! Why, I--I couldn\'t play it\r\nat all, I\'m afraid, if I--I didn\'t have enough to eat, and couldn\'t\r\never walk, or anything," she choked.\r\n\r\n"The game? What game? I don\'t know anything about any game," frowned\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\nPollyanna clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n"I know you don\'t--I know you don\'t, and that\'s why it\'s so perfectly\r\nlovely, and so--so wonderful! But listen. I\'ll tell you what the game\r\nis."\r\n\r\nAnd she told him.\r\n\r\n"Gee!" breathed the boy appreciatively, when she had finished. "Now\r\nwhat do you think of that!"\r\n\r\n"And here you are, playing MY game better than anybody I ever saw, and\r\nI don\'t even know your name yet, nor anything!" exclaimed Pollyanna,\r\nin almost awestruck tones. "But I want to;--I want to know\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! there\'s nothing to know," rejoined the boy, with a shrug.\r\n"Besides, see, here\'s poor Sir Lancelot and all the rest, waiting for\r\ntheir dinner," he finished.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, so they are," sighed Pollyanna, glancing impatiently at the\r\nfluttering and chattering creatures all about them. Recklessly she\r\nturned her bag upside down and scattered her supplies to the four\r\nwinds. "There, now, that\'s done, and we can talk again," she rejoiced.\r\n"And there\'s such a lot I want to know. First, please, what IS your\r\nname? I only know it isn\'t \'Sir James.\'"\r\n\r\nThe boy smiled.\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t; but that\'s what Jerry \'most always calls me. Mumsey and\r\nthe rest call me \'Jamie.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'JAMIE!\'" Pollyanna caught her breath and held it suspended. A wild\r\nhope had come to her eyes. It was followed almost instantly, however,\r\nby fearful doubt.\r\n\r\n"Does \'mumsey\' mean--mother?"\r\n\r\n"Sure!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna relaxed visibly. Her face fell. If this Jamie had a mother,\r\nhe could not, of course, be Mrs. Carew\'s Jamie, whose mother had died\r\nlong ago. Still, even as he was, he was wonderfully interesting.\r\n\r\n"But where do you live?" she catechized eagerly. "Is there anybody\r\nelse in your family but your mother and--and Jerry? Do you always come\r\nhere every day? Where is your Jolly Book? Mayn\'t I see it? Don\'t the\r\ndoctors say you can ever walk again? And where was it you said you got\r\nit?--this wheel chair, I mean."\r\n\r\nThe boy chuckled.\r\n\r\n"Say, how many of them questions do you expect me to answer all at\r\nonce? I\'ll begin at the last one, anyhow, and work backwards, maybe,\r\nif I don\'t forget what they be. I got this chair a year ago. Jerry\r\nknew one of them fellers what writes for papers, you know, and he put\r\nit in about me--how I couldn\'t ever walk, and all that, and--and the\r\nJolly Book, you see. The first thing I knew, a whole lot of men and\r\nwomen come one day toting this chair, and said \'twas for me. That\r\nthey\'d read all about me, and they wanted me to have it to remember\r\nthem by."\r\n\r\n"My! how glad you must have been!"\r\n\r\n"I was. It took a whole page of my Jolly Book to tell about that\r\nchair."\r\n\r\n"But can\'t you EVER walk again?" Pollyanna\'s eyes were blurred with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"It don\'t look like it. They said I couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but that\'s what they said about me, and then they sent me to Dr.\r\nAmes, and I stayed \'most a year; and HE made me walk. Maybe he could\r\nYOU!"\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head.\r\n\r\n"He couldn\'t--you see; I couldn\'t go to him, anyway. \'Twould cost too\r\nmuch. We\'ll just have to call it that I can\'t ever--walk again. But\r\nnever mind." The boy threw back his head impatiently. "I\'m trying not\r\nto THINK of that. You know what it is when--when your THINK gets to\r\ngoing."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, of course--and here I am talking about it!" cried\r\nPollyanna, penitently. "I SAID you knew how to play the game better\r\nthan I did, now. But go on. You haven\'t told me half, yet. Where do\r\nyou live? And is Jerry all the brothers and sisters you\'ve got?"\r\n\r\nA swift change came to the boy\'s face. His eyes glowed.\r\n\r\n"Yes--and he ain\'t mine, really. He ain\'t any relation, nor mumsey\r\nain\'t, neither. And only think how good they\'ve been to me!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" questioned Pollyanna, instantly on the alert. "Isn\'t\r\nthat--that \'mumsey\' your mother at all?"\r\n\r\n"No; and that\'s what makes--"\r\n\r\n"And haven\'t you got any mother?" interrupted Pollyanna, in growing\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"No; I never remember any mother, and father died six years ago."\r\n\r\n"How old were you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I was little. Mumsey says she guesses maybe I was about\r\nsix. That\'s when they took me, you see."\r\n\r\n"And your name is Jamie?" Pollyanna was holding her breath.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, I told you that."\r\n\r\n"And what\'s the other name?" Longingly, but fearfully, Pollyanna asked\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"YOU DON\'T KNOW!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember. I was too little, I suppose. Even the Murphys don\'t\r\nknow. They never knew me as anything but Jamie."\r\n\r\nA great disappointment came to Pollyanna\'s face, but almost\r\nimmediately a flash of thought drove the shadow away.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow, if you don\'t know what your name is, you can\'t know it\r\nisn\'t \'Kent\'!" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"\'Kent\'?" puzzled the boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes," began Pollyanna, all excitement. "You see, there was a little\r\nboy named Jamie Kent that--" She stopped abruptly and bit her lip. It\r\nhad occurred to Pollyanna that it would be kinder not to let this boy\r\nknow yet of her hope that he might be the lost Jamie. It would be\r\nbetter that she make sure of it before raising any expectations,\r\notherwise she might be bringing him sorrow rather than joy. She had\r\nnot forgotten how disappointed Jimmy Bean had been when she had been\r\nobliged to tell him that the Ladies\' Aid did not want him, and again\r\nwhen at first Mr. Pendleton had not wanted him, either. She was\r\ndetermined that she would not make the same mistake a third time; so\r\nvery promptly now she assumed an air of elaborate indifference on this\r\nmost dangerous subject, as she said:\r\n\r\n"But never mind about Jamie Kent. Tell me about yourself. I\'m SO\r\ninterested!"\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t anything to tell. I don\'t know anything nice," hesitated\r\nthe boy. "They said father was--was queer, and never talked. They\r\ndidn\'t even know his name. Everybody called him \'The Professor.\'\r\nMumsey says he and I lived in a little back room on the top floor of\r\nthe house in Lowell where they used to live. They were poor then, but\r\nthey wasn\'t near so poor as they are now. Jerry\'s father was alive\r\nthem days, and had a job."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, go on," prompted Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Well, mumsey says my father was sick a lot, and he got queerer and\r\nqueerer, so that they had me downstairs with them a good deal. I could\r\nwalk then, a little, but my legs wasn\'t right. I played with Jerry,\r\nand the little girl that died. Well, when father died there wasn\'t\r\nanybody to take me, and some men were goin\' to put me in an orphan\r\nasylum; but mumsey says I took on so, and Jerry took on so, that they\r\nsaid they\'d keep me. And they did. The little girl had just died, and\r\nthey said I might take her place. And they\'ve had me ever since. And I\r\nfell and got worse, and they\'re awful poor now, too, besides Jerry\'s\r\nfather dyin\'. But they\'ve kept me. Now ain\'t that what you call bein\'\r\npretty good to a feller?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, oh, yes," cried Pollyanna. "But they\'ll get their reward--I know\r\nthey\'ll get their reward!" Pollyanna was quivering with delight now.\r\nThe last doubt had fled. She had found the lost Jamie. She was sure of\r\nit. But not yet must she speak. First Mrs. Carew must see him.\r\nThen--THEN--! Even Pollyanna\'s imagination failed when it came to\r\npicturing the bliss in store for Mrs. Carew and Jamie at that glad\r\nreunion.\r\n\r\nShe sprang lightly to her feet in utter disregard of Sir Lancelot who\r\nhad come back and was nosing in her lap for more nuts.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to go now, but I\'ll come again to-morrow. Maybe I\'ll have a\r\nlady with me that you\'ll like to know. You\'ll be here to-morrow, won\'t\r\nyou?" she finished anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Sure, if it\'s pleasant. Jerry totes me up here \'most every mornin\'.\r\nThey fixed it so he could, you know; and I bring my dinner and stay\r\ntill four o\'clock. Jerry\'s good to me--he is!"\r\n\r\n"I know, I know," nodded Pollyanna. "And maybe you\'ll find somebody\r\nelse to be good to you, too," she caroled. With which cryptic\r\nstatement and a beaming smile, she was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPLANS AND PLOTTINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the way home Pollyanna made joyous plans. To-morrow, in some way or\r\nother, Mrs. Carew must be persuaded to go with her for a walk in the\r\nPublic Garden. Just how this was to be brought about Pollyanna did not\r\nknow; but brought about it must be.\r\n\r\nTo tell Mrs. Carew plainly that she had found Jamie, and wanted her to\r\ngo to see him, was out of the question. There was, of course, a bare\r\nchance that this might not be her Jamie; and if it were not, and if\r\nshe had thus raised in Mrs. Carew false hopes, the result might be\r\ndisastrous. Pollyanna knew, from what Mary had told her, that twice\r\nalready Mrs. Carew had been made very ill by the great disappointment\r\nof following alluring clues that had led to some boy very different\r\nfrom her dead sister\'s son. So Pollyanna knew that she could not tell\r\nMrs. Carew why she wanted her to go to walk to-morrow in the Public\r\nGarden. But there would be a way, declared Pollyanna to herself as she\r\nhappily hurried homeward.\r\n\r\nFate, however, as it happened, once more intervened in the shape of a\r\nheavy rainstorm; and Pollyanna did not have to more than look out of\r\ndoors the next morning to realize that there would be no Public Garden\r\nstroll that day. Worse yet, neither the next day nor the next saw the\r\nclouds dispelled; and Pollyanna spent all three afternoons wandering\r\nfrom window to window, peering up into the sky, and anxiously\r\ndemanding of every one: "DON\'T you think it looks a LITTLE like\r\nclearing up?"\r\n\r\nSo unusual was this behavior on the part of the cheery little girl,\r\nand so irritating was the constant questioning, that at last Mrs.\r\nCarew lost her patience.\r\n\r\n"For pity\'s sake, child, what is the trouble?" she cried. "I never\r\nknew you to fret so about the weather. Where\'s that wonderful glad\r\ngame of yours to-day?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna reddened and looked abashed.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, I reckon maybe I did forget the game this time," she\r\nadmitted. "And of course there IS something about it I can be glad\r\nfor, if I\'ll only hunt for it. I can be glad that--that it will HAVE\r\nto stop raining sometime \'cause God said he WOULDN\'T send another\r\nflood. But you see, I did so want it to be pleasant to-day."\r\n\r\n"Why, especially?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I--I just wanted to go to walk in the Public Garden." Pollyanna\r\nwas trying hard to speak unconcernedly. "I--I thought maybe you\'d like\r\nto go with me, too." Outwardly Pollyanna was nonchalance itself.\r\nInwardly, however, she was aquiver with excitement and suspense.\r\n\r\n"_I_ go to walk in the Public Garden?" queried Mrs. Carew, with brows\r\nslightly uplifted. "Thank you, no, I\'m afraid not," she smiled.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you--you wouldn\'t REFUSE!" faltered Pollyanna, in quick\r\npanic.\r\n\r\n"I have refused."\r\n\r\nPollyanna swallowed convulsively. She had grown really pale.\r\n\r\n"But, Mrs. Carew, please, PLEASE don\'t say you WON\'T go, when it gets\r\npleasant," she begged. "You see, for a--a special reason I wanted you\r\nto go--with me--just this once."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew frowned. She opened her lips to make the "no" more\r\ndecisive; but something in Pollyanna\'s pleading eyes must have changed\r\nthe words, for when they came they were a reluctant acquiescence.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, child, have your own way. But if I promise to go, YOU\r\nmust promise not to go near the window for an hour, and not to ask\r\nagain to-day if I think it\'s going to clear up."\r\n\r\n"Yes\'m, I will--I mean, I won\'t," palpitated Pollyanna. Then, as a\r\npale shaft of light that was almost a sunbeam, came aslant through the\r\nwindow, she cried joyously: "But you DO think it IS going to--Oh!" she\r\nbroke off in dismay, and ran from the room.\r\n\r\nUnmistakably it "cleared up" the next morning. But, though the sun\r\nshone brightly, there was a sharp chill in the air, and by afternoon,\r\nwhen Pollyanna came home from school, there was a brisk wind. In spite\r\nof protests, however, she insisted that it was a beautiful day out,\r\nand that she should be perfectly miserable if Mrs. Carew would not\r\ncome for a walk in the Public Garden. And Mrs. Carew went, though\r\nstill protesting.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, it was a fruitless journey. Together the\r\nimpatient woman and the anxious-eyed little girl hurried shiveringly\r\nup one path and down another. (Pollyanna, not finding the boy in his\r\naccustomed place, was making frantic search in every nook and corner\r\nof the Garden. To Pollyanna it seemed that she could not have it so.\r\nHere she was in the Garden, and here with her was Mrs. Carew; but not\r\nanywhere to be found was Jamie--and yet not one word could she say to\r\nMrs. Carew.) At last, thoroughly chilled and exasperated, Mrs. Carew\r\ninsisted on going home; and despairingly Pollyanna went.\r\n\r\nSorry days came to Pollyanna then. What to her was perilously near a\r\nsecond deluge--but according to Mrs. Carew was merely "the usual fall\r\nrains"--brought a series of damp, foggy, cold, cheerless days, filled\r\nwith either a dreary drizzle of rain, or, worse yet, a steady\r\ndownpour. If perchance occasionally there came a day of sunshine,\r\nPollyanna always flew to the Garden; but in vain. Jamie was never\r\nthere. It was the middle of November now, and even the Garden itself\r\nwas full of dreariness. The trees were bare, the benches almost empty,\r\nand not one boat was on the little pond. True, the squirrels and\r\npigeons were there, and the sparrows were as pert as ever, but to feed\r\nthem was almost more of a sorrow than a joy, for every saucy switch of\r\nSir Lancelot\'s feathery tail but brought bitter memories of the lad\r\nwho had given him his name--and who was not there.\r\n\r\n"And to think I didn\'t find out where he lived!" mourned Pollyanna to\r\nherself over and over again, as the days passed. "And he was Jamie--I\r\njust know he was Jamie. And now I\'ll have to wait and wait till spring\r\ncomes, and it\'s warm enough for him to come here again. And then,\r\nmaybe, _I_ sha\'n\'t be coming here by that time. O dear, O dear--and he\r\nWAS Jamie, I know he was Jamie!"\r\n\r\nThen, one dreary afternoon, the unexpected happened. Pollyanna,\r\npassing through the upper hallway heard angry voices in the hall\r\nbelow, one of which she recognized as being Mary\'s, while the\r\nother--the other--\r\n\r\nThe other voice was saying:\r\n\r\n"Not on yer life! It\'s nix on the beggin\' business. Do yer get me? I\r\nwants ter see the kid, Pollyanna. I got a message for her from--from\r\nSir James. Now beat it, will ye, and trot out the kid, if ye don\'t\r\nmind."\r\n\r\nWith a glad little cry Pollyanna turned and fairly flew down the\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m here, I\'m here, I\'m right here!" she panted, stumbling\r\nforward. "What is it? Did Jamie send you?"\r\n\r\nIn her excitement she had almost flung herself with outstretched arms\r\nupon the boy when Mary intercepted a shocked, restraining hand.\r\n\r\n"Miss Pollyanna, Miss Pollyanna, do you mean to say you know\r\nthis--this beggar boy?"\r\n\r\nThe boy flushed angrily; but before he could speak Pollyanna\r\ninterposed valiant championship.\r\n\r\n"He isn\'t a beggar boy. He belongs to one of my very best friends.\r\nBesides, he\'s the one that found me and brought me home that time I\r\nwas lost." Then to the boy she turned with impetuous questioning.\r\n"What is it? Did Jamie send you?"\r\n\r\n"Sure he did. He hit the hay a month ago, and he hain\'t been up\r\nsince."\r\n\r\n"He hit--what?" puzzled Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Hit the hay--went ter bed. He\'s sick, I mean, and he wants ter see\r\nye. Will ye come?"\r\n\r\n"Sick? Oh, I\'m so sorry!" grieved Pollyanna. "Of course I\'ll come.\r\nI\'ll go get my hat and coat right away."\r\n\r\n"Miss Pollyanna!" gasped Mary in stern disapproval. "As if Mrs. Carew\r\nwould let you go--ANYWHERE with a strange boy like this!"\r\n\r\n"But he isn\'t a strange boy," objected Pollyanna. "I\'ve known him ever\r\nso long, and I MUST go. I--"\r\n\r\n"What in the world is the meaning of this?" demanded Mrs. Carew icily\r\nfrom the drawing-room doorway. "Pollyanna, who is this boy, and what\r\nis he doing here?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna turned with a quick cry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Carew, you\'ll let me go, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Go where?"\r\n\r\n"To see my brother, ma\'am," cut in the boy hurriedly, and with an\r\nobvious effort to be very polite. "He\'s sort of off his feed, ye know,\r\nand he wouldn\'t give me no peace till I come up--after her," with an\r\nawkward gesture toward Pollyanna. "He thinks a sight an\' all of her."\r\n\r\n"I may go, mayn\'t I?" pleaded Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew frowned.\r\n\r\n"Go with this boy--YOU? Certainly not, Pollyanna! I wonder you are\r\nwild enough to think of it for a moment."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I want you to come, too," began Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"I? Absurd, child! That is impossible. You may give this boy here a\r\nlittle money, if you like, but--"\r\n\r\n"Thank ye, ma\'am, but I didn\'t come for money," resented the boy, his\r\neyes flashing. "I come for--her."\r\n\r\n"Yes, and Mrs. Carew, it\'s Jerry--Jerry Murphy, the boy that found me\r\nwhen I was lost, and brought me home," appealed Pollyanna. "NOW won\'t\r\nyou let me go?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew shook her head.\r\n\r\n"It is out of the question, Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"But he says Ja-- --the other boy is sick, and wants me!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that."\r\n\r\n"And I know him real well, Mrs. Carew. I do, truly. He reads\r\nbooks--lovely books, all full of knights and lords and ladies, and he\r\nfeeds the birds and squirrels and gives \'em names, and everything. And\r\nhe can\'t walk, and he doesn\'t have enough to eat, lots of days,"\r\npanted Pollyanna; "and he\'s been playing my glad game for a year, and\r\ndidn\'t know it. And he plays it ever and ever so much better than I\r\ndo. And I\'ve hunted and hunted for him, ever and ever so many days.\r\nHonest and truly, Mrs. Carew, I\'ve just GOT to see him," almost sobbed\r\nPollyanna. "I can\'t lose him again!"\r\n\r\nAn angry color flamed into Mrs. Carew\'s cheeks.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, this is sheer nonsense. I am surprised. I am amazed at you\r\nfor insisting upon doing something you know I disapprove of. I CAN NOT\r\nallow you to go with this boy. Now please let me hear no more about\r\nit."\r\n\r\nA new expression came to Pollyanna\'s face. With a look half-terrified,\r\nhalf-exalted, she lifted her chin and squarely faced Mrs. Carew.\r\nTremulously, but determinedly, she spoke.\r\n\r\n"Then I\'ll have to tell you. I didn\'t mean to--till I was sure. I\r\nwanted you to see him first. But now I\'ve got to tell. I can\'t lose\r\nhim again. I think, Mrs. Carew, he\'s--Jamie."\r\n\r\n"Jamie! Not--my--Jamie!" Mrs. Carew\'s face had grown very white.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!"\r\n\r\n"I know; but, please, his name IS Jamie, and he doesn\'t know the other\r\none. His father died when he was six years old, and he can\'t remember\r\nhis mother. He\'s twelve years old, he thinks. These folks took him in\r\nwhen his father died, and his father was queer, and didn\'t tell folks\r\nhis name, and--"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Carew had stopped her with a gesture. Mrs. Carew was even\r\nwhiter than before, but her eyes burned with a sudden fire.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll go at once," she said. "Mary, tell Perkins to have the car here\r\nas soon as possible. Pollyanna, get your hat and coat. Boy, wait here,\r\nplease. We\'ll be ready to go with you immediately." The next minute\r\nshe had hurried up-stairs.\r\n\r\nIn the hall the boy drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n"Gee whiz!" he muttered softly. "If we ain\'t goin\' ter go in a\r\nbuzz-wagon! Some class ter that! Gorry! what\'ll Sir James say?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nIN MURPHY\'S ALLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the opulent purr that seems to be peculiar to luxurious\r\nlimousines, Mrs. Carew\'s car rolled down Commonwealth Avenue and out\r\nupon Arlington Street to Charles. Inside sat a shining-eyed little\r\ngirl and a white-faced, tense woman. Outside, to give directions to\r\nthe plainly disapproving chauffeur, sat Jerry Murphy, inordinately\r\nproud and insufferably important.\r\n\r\nWhen the limousine came to a stop before a shabby doorway in a narrow,\r\ndirty alley, the boy leaped to the ground, and, with a ridiculous\r\nimitation of the liveried pomposities he had so often watched, threw\r\nopen the door of the car and stood waiting for the ladies to alight.\r\n\r\nPollyanna sprang out at once, her eyes widening with amazement and\r\ndistress as she looked about her. Behind her came Mrs. Carew, visibly\r\nshuddering as her gaze swept the filth, the sordidness, and the ragged\r\nchildren that swarmed shrieking and chattering out of the dismal\r\ntenements, and surrounded the car in a second.\r\n\r\nJerry waved his arms angrily.\r\n\r\n"Here, you, beat it!" he yelled to the motley throng. "This ain\'t no\r\nfree movies! CAN that racket and get a move on ye. Lively, now! We\r\ngotta get by. Jamie\'s got comp\'ny."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew shuddered again, and laid a trembling hand on Jerry\'s\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"Not--HERE!" she recoiled.\r\n\r\nBut the boy did not hear. With shoves and pushes from sturdy fists and\r\nelbows, he was making a path for his charges; and before Mrs. Carew\r\nknew quite how it was done, she found herself with the boy and\r\nPollyanna at the foot of a rickety flight of stairs in a dim,\r\nevil-smelling hallway.\r\n\r\nOnce more she put out a shaking hand.\r\n\r\n"Wait," she commanded huskily. "Remember! Don\'t either of you say a\r\nword about--about his being possibly the boy I\'m looking for. I must\r\nsee for myself first, and--question him."\r\n\r\n"Of course!" agreed Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Sure! I\'m on," nodded the boy. "I gotta go right off anyhow, so I\r\nwon\'t bother ye none. Now toddle easy up these \'ere stairs. There\'s\r\nalways holes, and most generally there\'s a kid or two asleep\r\nsomewheres. An\' the elevator ain\'t runnin\' ter-day," he gibed\r\ncheerfully. "We gotta go ter the top, too!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew found the "holes"--broken boards that creaked and bent\r\nfearsomely under her shrinking feet; and she found one "kid"--a\r\ntwo-year-old baby playing with an empty tin can on a string which he\r\nwas banging up and down the second flight of stairs. On all sides\r\ndoors were opened, now boldly, now stealthily, but always disclosing\r\nwomen with tousled heads or peering children with dirty faces.\r\nSomewhere a baby was wailing piteously. Somewhere else a man was\r\ncursing. Everywhere was the smell of bad whiskey, stale cabbage, and\r\nunwashed humanity.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the third and last stairway the boy came to a pause\r\nbefore a closed door.\r\n\r\n"I\'m just a-thinkin\' what Sir James\'ll say when he\'s wise ter the\r\nprize package I\'m bringin\' him," he whispered in a throaty voice. "I\r\nknow what mumsey\'ll do--she\'ll turn on the weeps in no time ter see\r\nJamie so tickled." The next moment he threw wide the door with a gay:\r\n"Here we be--an\' we come in a buzz-wagon! Ain\'t that goin\' some, Sir\r\nJames?"\r\n\r\nIt was a tiny room, cold and cheerless and pitifully bare, but\r\nscrupulously neat. There were here no tousled heads, no peering\r\nchildren, no odors of whiskey, cabbage, and unclean humanity. There\r\nwere two beds, three broken chairs, a dry-goods-box table, and a stove\r\nwith a faint glow of light that told of a fire not nearly brisk enough\r\nto heat even that tiny room. On one of the beds lay a lad with flushed\r\ncheeks and fever-bright eyes. Near him sat a thin, white-faced woman,\r\nbent and twisted with rheumatism.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew stepped into the room and, as if to steady herself, paused\r\na minute with her back to the wall. Pollyanna hurried forward with a\r\nlow cry just as Jerry, with an apologetic "I gotta go now; good-by!"\r\ndashed through the door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jamie, I\'m so glad I\'ve found you," cried Pollyanna. "You don\'t\r\nknow how I\'ve looked and looked for you every day. But I\'m so sorry\r\nyou\'re sick!"\r\n\r\nJamie smiled radiantly and held out a thin white hand.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t sorry--I\'m GLAD," he emphasized meaningly; "\'cause it\'s\r\nbrought you to see me. Besides, I\'m better now, anyway. Mumsey, this\r\nis the little girl, you know, that told me the glad game--and mumsey\'s\r\nplaying it, too," he triumphed, turning back to Pollyanna. "First she\r\ncried \'cause her back hurts too bad to let her work; then when I was\r\ntook worse she was GLAD she couldn\'t work, \'cause she could be here to\r\ntake care of me, you know."\r\n\r\nAt that moment Mrs. Carew hurried forward, her eyes half-fearfully,\r\nhalf-longingly on the face of the lame boy in the bed.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Mrs. Carew. I\'ve brought her to see you, Jamie," introduced\r\nPollyanna, in a tremulous voice.\r\n\r\nThe little twisted woman by the bed had struggled to her feet by this\r\ntime, and was nervously offering her chair. Mrs. Carew accepted it\r\nwithout so much as a glance. Her eyes were still on the boy in the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n"Your name is--Jamie?" she asked, with visible difficulty.\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am." The boy\'s bright eyes looked straight into hers.\r\n\r\n"What is your other name?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"He is not your son?" For the first time Mrs. Carew turned to the\r\ntwisted little woman who was still standing by the bed.\r\n\r\n"No, madam."\r\n\r\n"And you don\'t know his name?"\r\n\r\n"No, madam. I never knew it."\r\n\r\nWith a despairing gesture Mrs. Carew turned back to the boy.\r\n\r\n"But think, think--don\'t you remember ANYTHING of your name\r\nbut--Jamie?"\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head. Into his eyes was coming a puzzled wonder.\r\n\r\n"No, nothing."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you anything that belonged to your father, with possibly his\r\nname in it?"\r\n\r\n"There wasn\'t anythin\' worth savin\' but them books," interposed Mrs.\r\nMurphy. "Them\'s his. Maybe you\'d like to look at \'em," she suggested,\r\npointing to a row of worn volumes on a shelf across the room. Then, in\r\nplainly uncontrollable curiosity, she asked: "Was you thinkin\' you\r\nknew him, ma\'am?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," murmured Mrs. Carew, in a half-stifled voice, as she\r\nrose to her feet and crossed the room to the shelf of books.\r\n\r\nThere were not many--perhaps ten or a dozen. There was a volume of\r\nShakespeare\'s plays, an "Ivanhoe," a much-thumbed "Lady of the Lake,"\r\na book of miscellaneous poems, a coverless "Tennyson," a dilapidated\r\n"Little Lord Fauntleroy," and two or three books of ancient and\r\nmedieval history. But, though Mrs. Carew looked carefully through\r\nevery one, she found nowhere any written word. With a despairing sigh\r\nshe turned back to the boy and to the woman, both of whom now were\r\nwatching her with startled, questioning eyes.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d tell me--both of you--all you know about yourselves,"\r\nshe said brokenly, dropping herself once more into the chair by the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAnd they told her. It was much the same story that Jamie had told\r\nPollyanna in the Public Garden. There was little that was new, nothing\r\nthat was significant, in spite of the probing questions that Mrs.\r\nCarew asked. At its conclusion Jamie turned eager eyes on Mrs. Carew\'s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you knew--my father?" he begged.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew closed her eyes and pressed her hand to her head.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t--know," she answered. "But I think--not."\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a quick cry of keen disappointment, but as quickly she\r\nsuppressed it in obedience to Mrs. Carew\'s warning glance. With new\r\nhorror, however, she surveyed the tiny room.\r\n\r\nJamie, turning his wondering eyes from Mrs. Carew\'s face, suddenly\r\nawoke to his duties as host.\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t you good to come!" he said to Pollyanna, gratefully. "How\'s\r\nSir Lancelot? Do you ever go to feed him now?" Then, as Pollyanna did\r\nnot answer at once, he hurried on, his eyes going from her face to the\r\nsomewhat battered pink in a broken-necked bottle in the window. "Did\r\nyou see my posy? Jerry found it. Somebody dropped it and he picked it\r\nup. Ain\'t it pretty? And it SMELLS a little."\r\n\r\nBut Pollyanna did not seem even to have heard him. She was still\r\ngazing, wide-eyed about the room, clasping and unclasping her hands\r\nnervously.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see how you can ever play the game here at all, Jamie,"\r\nshe faltered. "I didn\'t suppose there could be anywhere such a\r\nperfectly awful place to live," she shuddered.\r\n\r\n"Ho!" scoffed Jamie, valiantly. "You\'d oughter see the Pikes\'\r\ndown-stairs. Theirs is a whole lot worse\'n this. You don\'t know what a\r\nlot of nice things there is about this room. Why, we get the sun in\r\nthat winder there for \'most two hours every day, when it shines. And\r\nif you get real near it you can see a whole lot of sky from it. If we\r\ncould only KEEP the room!--but you see we\'ve got to leave, we\'re\r\nafraid. And that\'s what\'s worrin\' us."\r\n\r\n"Leave!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. We got behind on the rent--mumsey bein\' sick so, and not earnin\'\r\nanythin\'." In spite of a courageously cheerful smile, Jamie\'s voice\r\nshook. "Mis\' Dolan down-stairs--the woman what keeps my wheel chair\r\nfor me, you know--is helpin\' us out this week. But of course she can\'t\r\ndo it always, and then we\'ll have to go--if Jerry don\'t strike it\r\nrich, or somethin\'."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but can\'t we--" began Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nShe stopped short. Mrs. Carew had risen to her feet abruptly with a\r\nhurried:\r\n\r\n"Come, Pollyanna, we must go." Then to the woman she turned wearily.\r\n"You won\'t have to leave. I\'ll send you money and food at once, and\r\nI\'ll mention your case to one of the charity organizations in which I\r\nam interested, and they will--"\r\n\r\nIn surprise she ceased speaking. The bent little figure of the woman\r\nopposite had drawn itself almost erect. Mrs. Murphy\'s cheeks were\r\nflushed. Her eyes showed a smouldering fire.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, no, Mrs. Carew," she said tremulously, but proudly. "We\'re\r\npoor--God knows; but we ain\'t charity folks."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" cried Mrs. Carew, sharply. "You\'re letting the woman\r\ndown-stairs help you. This boy said so."\r\n\r\n"I know; but that ain\'t charity," persisted the woman, still\r\ntremulously. "Mrs. Dolan is my FRIEND. She knows I\'D do HER a good\r\nturn just as quick--I have done \'em for her in times past. Help from\r\nFRIENDS ain\'t charity. They CARE; and that--that makes a difference.\r\nWe wa\'n\'t always as we are now, you see; and that makes it hurt all\r\nthe more--all this. Thank you; but we couldn\'t take--your money."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew frowned angrily. It had been a most disappointing,\r\nheart-breaking, exhausting hour for her. Never a patient woman, she\r\nwas exasperated now, besides being utterly tired out.\r\n\r\n"Very well, just as you please," she said coldly. Then, with vague\r\nirritation she added: "But why don\'t you go to your landlord and\r\ninsist that he make you even decently comfortable while you do stay?\r\nSurely you\'re entitled to something besides broken windows stuffed\r\nwith rags and papers! And those stairs that I came up are positively\r\ndangerous."\r\n\r\nMrs. Murphy sighed in a discouraged way. Her twisted little figure had\r\nfallen back into its old hopelessness.\r\n\r\n"We have tried to have something done, but it\'s never amounted to\r\nanything. We never see anybody but the agent, of course; and he says\r\nthe rents are too low for the owner to put out any more money on\r\nrepairs."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" snapped Mrs. Carew, with all the sharpness of a nervous,\r\ndistraught woman who has at last found an outlet for her exasperation.\r\n"It\'s shameful! What\'s more, I think it\'s a clear case of violation of\r\nthe law;--those stairs are, certainly. I shall make it my business to\r\nsee that he\'s brought to terms. What is the name of that agent, and\r\nwho is the owner of this delectable establishment?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know the name of the owner, madam; but the agent is Mr.\r\nDodge."\r\n\r\n"Dodge!" Mrs. Carew turned sharply, an odd look on her face. "You\r\ndon\'t mean--Henry Dodge?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, madam. His name is Henry, I think."\r\n\r\nA flood of color swept into Mrs. Carew\'s face, then receded, leaving\r\nit whiter than before.\r\n\r\n"Very well, I--I\'ll attend to it," she murmured, in a half-stifled\r\nvoice, turning away. "Come, Pollyanna, we must go now."\r\n\r\nOver at the bed Pollyanna was bidding Jamie a tearful good-by.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll come again. I\'ll come real soon," she promised brightly, as\r\nshe hurried through the door after Mrs. Carew.\r\n\r\nNot until they had picked their precarious way down the three long\r\nflights of stairs and through the jabbering, gesticulating crowd of\r\nmen, women, and children that surrounded the scowling Perkins and the\r\nlimousine, did Pollyanna speak again. But then she scarcely waited for\r\nthe irate chauffeur to slam the door upon them before she pleaded:\r\n\r\n"Dear Mrs. Carew, please, please say that it was Jamie! Oh, it would\r\nbe so nice for him to be Jamie."\r\n\r\n"But he isn\'t Jamie!"\r\n\r\n"O dear! Are you sure?"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s pause, then Mrs. Carew covered her face with her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n"No, I\'m not sure--and that\'s the tragedy of it," she moaned. "I don\'t\r\nthink he is; I\'m almost positive he isn\'t. But, of course, there IS a\r\nchance--and that\'s what\'s killing me."\r\n\r\n"Then can\'t you just THINK he\'s Jamie," begged Pollyanna, "and play he\r\nwas? Then you could take him home, and--" But Mrs. Carew turned\r\nfiercely.\r\n\r\n"Take that boy into my home when he WASN\'T Jamie? Never, Pollyanna! I\r\ncouldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"But if you CAN\'T help Jamie, I should think you\'d be so glad there\r\nwas some one like him you COULD help," urged Pollyanna, tremulously.\r\n"What if your Jamie was like this Jamie, all poor and sick, wouldn\'t\r\nyou want some one to take him in and comfort him, and--"\r\n"Don\'t--don\'t, Pollyanna," moaned Mrs. Carew, turning her head from\r\nside to side, in a frenzy of grief. "When I think that maybe,\r\nsomewhere, our Jamie is like that--" Only a choking sob finished the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just what I mean--that\'s just what I mean!" triumphed\r\nPollyanna, excitedly. "Don\'t you see? If this IS your Jamie, of course\r\nyou\'ll want him; and if it isn\'t, you couldn\'t be doing any harm to\r\nthe other Jamie by taking this one, and you\'d do a whole lot of good,\r\nfor you\'d make this one so happy--so happy! And then, by and by, if\r\nyou should find the real Jamie, you wouldn\'t have lost anything, but\r\nyou\'d have made two little boys happy instead of one; and--" But again\r\nMrs. Carew interrupted her.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t, Pollyanna, don\'t! I want to think--I want to think."\r\n\r\nTearfully Pollyanna sat back in her seat. By a very visible effort she\r\nkept still for one whole minute. Then, as if the words fairly bubbled\r\nforth of themselves, there came this:\r\n\r\n"Oh, but what an awful, awful place that was! I just wish the man that\r\nowned it had to live in it himself--and then see what he\'d have to be\r\nglad for!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew sat suddenly erect. Her face showed a curious change.\r\nAlmost as if in appeal she flung out her hand toward Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!" she cried. "Perhaps--she didn\'t know, Pollyanna. Perhaps she\r\ndidn\'t know. I\'m sure she didn\'t know--she owned a place like that.\r\nBut it will be fixed now--it will be fixed."\r\n\r\n"SHE! Is it a woman that owns it, and do you know her? And do you know\r\nthe agent, too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." Mrs. Carew bit her lips. "I know her, and I know the agent."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'m so glad," sighed Pollyanna. "Then it\'ll be all right now."\r\n\r\n"Well, it certainly will be--better," avowed Mrs. Carew with emphasis,\r\nas the car stopped before her own door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew spoke as if she knew what she was talking about. And\r\nperhaps, indeed, she did--better than she cared to tell Pollyanna.\r\nCertainly, before she slept that night, a letter left her hands\r\naddressed to one Henry Dodge, summoning him to an immediate conference\r\nas to certain changes and repairs to be made at once in tenements she\r\nowned. There were, moreover, several scathing sentences concerning\r\n"rag-stuffed windows," and "rickety stairways," that caused this same\r\nHenry Dodge to scowl angrily, and to say a sharp word behind his\r\nteeth--though at the same time he paled with something very like fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA SURPRISE FOR MRS. CAREW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter of repairs and improvements having been properly and\r\nefficiently attended to, Mrs. Carew told herself that she had done her\r\nduty, and that the matter was closed. She would forget it. The boy was\r\nnot Jamie--he could not be Jamie. That ignorant, sickly, crippled boy\r\nher dead sister\'s son? Impossible! She would cast the whole thing from\r\nher thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt was just here, however, that Mrs. Carew found herself against an\r\nimmovable, impassable barrier: the whole thing refused to be cast from\r\nher thoughts. Always before her eyes was the picture of that bare\r\nlittle room and the wistful-faced boy. Always in her ears was that\r\nheartbreaking "What if it WERE Jamie?" And always, too, there was\r\nPollyanna; for even though Mrs. Carew might (as she did) silence the\r\npleadings and questionings of the little girl\'s tongue, there was no\r\ngetting away from the prayers and reproaches of the little girl\'s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nTwice again in desperation Mrs. Carew went to see the boy, telling\r\nherself each time that only another visit was needed to convince her\r\nthat the boy was not the one she sought. But, even though while there\r\nin the boy\'s presence, she told herself that she WAS convinced, once\r\naway from it, the old, old questioning returned. At last, in still\r\ngreater desperation, she wrote to her sister, and told her the whole\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n"I had not meant to tell you," she wrote, after she had stated the\r\nbare facts of the case. "I thought it a pity to harrow you up, or to\r\nraise false hopes. I am so sure it is not he--and yet, even as I write\r\nthese words, I know I am NOT sure. That is why I want you to come--why\r\nyou must come. I must have you see him.\r\n\r\n"I wonder--oh, I wonder what you\'ll say! Of course we haven\'t seen our\r\nJamie since he was four years old. He would be twelve now. This boy is\r\ntwelve, I should judge. (He doesn\'t know his age.) He has hair and\r\neyes not unlike our Jamie\'s. He is crippled, but that condition came\r\nupon him through a fall, six years ago, and was made worse through\r\nanother one four years later. Anything like a complete description of\r\nhis father\'s appearance seems impossible to obtain; but what I have\r\nlearned contains nothing conclusive either for or against his being\r\npoor Doris\'s husband. He was called \'the Professor,\' was very queer,\r\nand seemed to own nothing save a few books. This might, or might not\r\nsignify. John Kent was certainly always queer, and a good deal of a\r\nBohemian in his tastes. Whether he cared for books or not I don\'t\r\nremember. Do you? And of course the title \'Professor\' might easily\r\nhave been assumed, if he wished, or it might have been merely given\r\nhim by others. As for this boy--I don\'t know, I don\'t know--but I do\r\nhope YOU will!\r\n\r\n                                    "Your distracted sister,\r\n\r\n                                    "RUTH."\r\n\r\nDella came at once, and she went immediately to see the boy; but she\r\ndid not "know." Like her sister, she said she did not think it was\r\ntheir Jamie, but at the same time there was that chance--it might be\r\nhe, after all. Like Pollyanna, however, she had what she thought was a\r\nvery satisfactory way out of the dilemma.\r\n\r\n"But why don\'t you take him, dear?" she proposed to her sister. "Why\r\ndon\'t you take him and adopt him? It would be lovely for him--poor\r\nlittle fellow--and--" But Mrs. Carew shuddered and would not even let\r\nher finish.\r\n\r\n"No, no, I can\'t, I can\'t!" she moaned. "I want my Jamie, my own\r\nJamie--or no one." And with a sigh Della gave it up and went back to\r\nher nursing.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Carew thought that this closed the matter, however, she was\r\nagain mistaken; for her days were still restless, and her nights were\r\nstill either sleepless or filled with dreams of a "may be" or a "might\r\nbe" masquerading as an "it is so." She was, moreover, having a\r\ndifficult time with Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was puzzled. She was filled with questionings and unrest.\r\nFor the first time in her life Pollyanna had come face to face with\r\nreal poverty. She knew people who did not have enough to eat, who wore\r\nragged clothing, and who lived in dark, dirty, and very tiny rooms.\r\nHer first impulse, of course, had been "to help." With Mrs. Carew she\r\nmade two visits to Jamie, and greatly did she rejoice at the changed\r\nconditions she found there after "that man Dodge" had "tended to\r\nthings." But this, to Pollyanna, was a mere drop in the bucket. There\r\nwere yet all those other sick-looking men, unhappy-looking women, and\r\nragged children out in the street--Jamie\'s neighbors. Confidently she\r\nlooked to Mrs. Carew for help for them, also.\r\n\r\n"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Carew, when she learned what was expected of\r\nher, "so you want the whole street to be supplied with fresh paper,\r\npaint, and new stairways, do you? Pray, is there anything else you\'d\r\nlike?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, lots of things," sighed Pollyanna, happily. "You see, there\r\nare so many things they need--all of them! And what fun it will be to\r\nget them! How I wish I was rich so I could help, too; but I\'m \'most as\r\nglad to be with you when you get them."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew quite gasped aloud in her amazement. She lost no\r\ntime--though she did lose not a little patience--in explaining that\r\nshe had no intention of doing anything further in "Murphy\'s Alley,"\r\nand that there was no reason why she should. No one would expect her\r\nto. She had canceled all possible obligations, and had even been\r\nreally very generous, any one would say, in what she had done for the\r\ntenement where lived Jamie and the Murphys. (That she owned the\r\ntenement building she did not think it necessary to state.) At some\r\nlength she explained to Pollyanna that there were charitable\r\ninstitutions, both numerous and efficient, whose business it was to\r\naid all the worthy poor, and that to these institutions she gave\r\nfrequently and liberally.\r\n\r\nEven then, however, Pollyanna was not convinced.\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see," she argued, "why it\'s any better, or even so nice,\r\nfor a whole lot of folks to club together and do what everybody would\r\nlike to do for themselves. I\'m sure I\'d much rather give Jamie a--a\r\nnice book, now, than to have some old Society do it; and I KNOW he\'d\r\nlike better to have me do it, too."\r\n\r\n"Very likely," returned Mrs. Carew, with some weariness and a little\r\nexasperation. "But it is just possible that it would not be so well\r\nfor Jamie as--as if that book were given by a body of people who knew\r\nwhat sort of one to select."\r\n\r\nThis led her to say much, also (none of which Pollyanna in the least\r\nunderstood), about "pauperizing the poor," the "evils of\r\nindiscriminate giving," and the "pernicious effect of unorganized\r\ncharity."\r\n\r\n"Besides," she added, in answer to the still perplexed expression on\r\nPollyanna\'s worried little face, "very likely if I offered help to\r\nthese people they would not take it. You remember Mrs. Murphy\r\ndeclined, at the first, to let me send food and clothing--though they\r\naccepted it readily enough from their neighbors on the first floor, it\r\nseems."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," sighed Pollyanna, turning away. "There\'s something\r\nthere somehow that I don\'t understand. But it doesn\'t seem right that\r\nWE should have such a lot of nice things, and that THEY shouldn\'t have\r\nanything, hardly."\r\n\r\nAs the days passed, this feeling on the part of Pollyanna increased\r\nrather than diminished; and the questions she asked and the comments\r\nshe made were anything but a relief to the state of mind in which Mrs.\r\nCarew herself was. Even the test of the glad game, in this case,\r\nPollyanna was finding to be very near a failure; for, as she expressed\r\nit:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how you can find anything about this poor-people business\r\nto be glad for. Of course we can be glad for ourselves that we aren\'t\r\npoor like them; but whenever I\'m thinking how glad I am for that, I\r\nget so sorry for them that I CAN\'T be glad any longer. Of course we\r\nCOULD be glad there were poor folks, because we could help them. But\r\nif we DON\'T help them, where\'s the glad part of that coming in?" And\r\nto this Pollyanna could find no one who could give her a satisfactory\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nEspecially she asked this question of Mrs. Carew; and Mrs. Carew,\r\nstill haunted by the visions of the Jamie that was, and the Jamie that\r\nmight be, grew only more restless, more wretched, and more utterly\r\ndespairing. Nor was she helped any by the approach of Christmas.\r\nNowhere was there glow of holly or flash of tinsel that did not carry\r\nits pang to her; for always to Mrs. Carew it but symbolized a child\'s\r\nempty stocking--a stocking that might be--Jamie\'s.\r\n\r\nFinally, a week before Christmas, she fought what she thought was the\r\nlast battle with herself. Resolutely, but with no real joy in her\r\nface, she gave terse orders to Mary, and summoned Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna," she began, almost harshly, "I have decided to--to take\r\nJamie. The car will be here at once. I\'m going after him now, and\r\nbring him home. You may come with me if you like."\r\n\r\nA great light transfigured Pollyanna\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, oh, oh, how glad I am!" she breathed. "Why, I\'m so glad I--I want\r\nto cry! Mrs. Carew, why is it, when you\'re the very gladdest of\r\nanything, you always want to cry?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, I\'m sure, Pollyanna," rejoined Mrs. Carew,\r\nabstractedly. On Mrs. Carew\'s face there was still no look of joy.\r\n\r\nOnce in the Murphys\' little one-room tenement, it did not take Mrs.\r\nCarew long to tell her errand. In a few short sentences she told the\r\nstory of the lost Jamie, and of her first hopes that this Jamie might\r\nbe he. She made no secret of her doubts that he was the one; at the\r\nsame time, she said she had decided to take him home with her and give\r\nhim every possible advantage. Then, a little wearily, she told what\r\nwere the plans she had made for him.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the bed Mrs. Murphy listened, crying softly. Across the\r\nroom Jerry Murphy, his eyes dilating, emitted an occasional low "Gee!\r\nCan ye beat that, now?" As to Jamie--Jamie, on the bed, had listened\r\nat first with the air of one to whom suddenly a door has opened into a\r\nlonged-for paradise; but gradually, as Mrs. Carew talked, a new look\r\ncame to his eyes. Very slowly he closed them, and turned away his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Carew ceased speaking there was a long silence before Jamie\r\nturned his head and answered. They saw then that his face was very\r\nwhite, and that his eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mrs. Carew, but--I can\'t go," he said simply.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t--what?" cried Mrs. Carew, as if she doubted the evidence of\r\nher own ears.\r\n\r\n"Jamie!" gasped Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, kid, what\'s eatin\' ye?" scowled Jerry, hurriedly coming\r\nforward. "Don\'t ye know a good thing when ye see it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but I can\'t--go," said the crippled boy, again.\r\n\r\n"But, Jamie, Jamie, think, THINK what it would mean to you!" quavered\r\nMrs. Murphy, at the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\n"I am a-thinkin\'," choked Jamie. "Don\'t you suppose I know what I\'m\r\ndoin\'--what I\'m givin\' up?" Then to Mrs. Carew he turned tear-wet\r\neyes. "I can\'t," he faltered. "I can\'t let you do all that for me. If\r\nyou--CARED it would be different. But you don\'t care--not really. You\r\ndon\'t WANT me--not ME. You want the real Jamie, and I ain\'t the real\r\nJamie. You don\'t think I am. I can see it in your face."\r\n\r\n"I know. But--but--" began Mrs. Carew, helplessly.\r\n\r\n"And it isn\'t as if--as if I was like other boys, and could walk,\r\neither," interrupted the cripple, feverishly. "You\'d get tired of me\r\nin no time. And I\'d see it comin\'. I couldn\'t stand it--to be a burden\r\nlike that. Of course, if you CARED--like mumsey here--" He threw out\r\nhis hand, choked back a sob, then turned his head away again. "I\'m not\r\nthe Jamie you want. I--can\'t--go," he said. With the words his thin,\r\nboyish hand fell clenched till the knuckles showed white against the\r\ntattered old shawl that covered the bed.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s breathless hush, then, very quietly, Mrs. Carew\r\ngot to her feet. Her face was colorless; but there was that in it that\r\nsilenced the sob that rose to Pollyanna\'s lips.\r\n\r\n"Come, Pollyanna," was all she said.\r\n\r\n"Well, if you ain\'t the fool limit!" babbled Jerry Murphy to the boy\r\non the bed, as the door closed a moment later.\r\n\r\nBut the boy on the bed was crying very much as if the closing door had\r\nbeen the one that had led to paradise--and that had closed now\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFROM BEHIND A COUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew was very angry. To have brought herself to the point where\r\nshe was willing to take this lame boy into her home, and then to have\r\nthe lad calmly refuse to come, was unbearable. Mrs. Carew was not in\r\nthe habit of having her invitations ignored, or her wishes scorned.\r\nFurthermore, now that she could not have the boy, she was conscious of\r\nan almost frantic terror lest he were, after all, the real Jamie. She\r\nknew then that her true reason for wanting him had been--not because\r\nshe cared for him, not even because she wished to help him and make\r\nhim happy--but because she hoped, by taking him, that she would ease\r\nher own mind, and forever silence that awful eternal questioning on\r\nher part: "What if he WERE her own Jamie?"\r\n\r\nIt certainly had not helped matters any that the boy had divined her\r\nstate of mind, and had given as the reason for his refusal that she\r\n"did not care." To be sure, Mrs. Carew now very proudly told herself\r\nthat she did not indeed "care," that he was NOT her sister\'s boy, and\r\nthat she would "forget all about it."\r\n\r\nBut she did not forget all about it. However insistently she might\r\ndisclaim responsibility and relationship, just as insistently\r\nresponsibility and relationship thrust themselves upon her in the\r\nshape of panicky doubts; and however resolutely she turned her\r\nthoughts to other matters, just so resolutely visions of a\r\nwistful-eyed boy in a poverty-stricken room loomed always before her.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there was Pollyanna. Clearly Pollyanna was not herself at\r\nall. In a most unPollyanna-like spirit she moped about the house,\r\nfinding apparently no interest anywhere.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I\'m not sick," she would answer, when remonstrated with, and\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\n"But what IS the trouble?"\r\n\r\n"Why, nothing. It--it\'s only that I was thinking of Jamie, you\r\nknow,--how HE hasn\'t got all these beautiful things--carpets, and\r\npictures, and curtains."\r\n\r\nIt was the same with her food. Pollyanna was actually losing her\r\nappetite; but here again she disclaimed sickness.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," she would sigh mournfully. "It\'s just that I don\'t seem\r\nhungry. Some way, just as soon as I begin to eat, I think of Jamie,\r\nand how HE doesn\'t have only old doughnuts and dry rolls; and then\r\nI--I don\'t want anything."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew, spurred by a feeling that she herself only dimly\r\nunderstood, and recklessly determined to bring about some change in\r\nPollyanna at all costs, ordered a huge tree, two dozen wreaths, and\r\nquantities of holly and Christmas baubles. For the first time in many\r\nyears the house was aflame and aglitter with scarlet and tinsel. There\r\nwas even to be a Christmas party, for Mrs. Carew had told Pollyanna to\r\ninvite half a dozen of her schoolgirl friends for the tree on\r\nChristmas Eve.\r\n\r\nBut even here Mrs. Carew met with disappointment; for, though\r\nPollyanna was always grateful, and at times interested and even\r\nexcited, she still carried frequently a sober little face. And in the\r\nend the Christmas party was more of a sorrow than a joy; for the first\r\nglimpse of the glittering tree sent her into a storm of sobs.\r\n\r\n"Why, Pollyanna!" ejaculated Mrs. Carew. "What in the world is the\r\nmatter now?"\r\n\r\n"N-n-nothing," wept Pollyanna. "It\'s only that it\'s so perfectly,\r\nperfectly beautiful that I just had to cry. I was thinking how Jamie\r\nwould love to see it."\r\n\r\nIt was then that Mrs. Carew\'s patience snapped.\r\n\r\n"\'Jamie, Jamie, Jamie\'!" she exclaimed. "Pollyanna, CAN\'T you stop\r\ntalking about that boy? You know perfectly well that it is not my\r\nfault that he is not here. I asked him to come here to live. Besides,\r\nwhere is that glad game of yours? I think it would be an excellent\r\nidea if you would play it on this."\r\n\r\n"I AM playing it," quavered Pollyanna. "And that\'s what I don\'t\r\nunderstand. I never knew it to act so funny. Why, before, when I\'ve\r\nbeen glad about things, I\'ve been happy. But now, about Jamie--I\'m so\r\nglad I\'ve got carpets and pictures and nice things to eat, and that I\r\ncan walk and run, and go to school, and all that; but the harder I\'m\r\nglad for myself, the sorrier I am for him. I never knew the game to\r\nact so funny, and I don\'t know what ails it. Do you?"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Carew, with a despairing gesture, merely turned away without\r\na word.\r\n\r\nIt was the day after Christmas that something so wonderful happened\r\nthat Pollyanna, for a time, almost forgot Jamie. Mrs. Carew had taken\r\nher shopping, and it was while Mrs. Carew was trying to decide between\r\na duchesse-lace and a point-lace collar, that Pollyanna chanced to spy\r\nfarther down the counter a face that looked vaguely familiar. For a\r\nmoment she regarded it frowningly; then, with a little cry, she ran\r\ndown the aisle.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s you--it IS you!" she exclaimed joyously to a girl who was\r\nputting into the show case a tray of pink bows. "I\'m so glad to see\r\nyou!"\r\n\r\nThe girl behind the counter lifted her head and stared at Pollyanna in\r\namazement. But almost immediately her dark, somber face lighted with a\r\nsmile of glad recognition.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, if it isn\'t my little Public Garden kiddie!" she\r\nejaculated.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I\'m so glad you remembered," beamed Pollyanna. "But you never\r\ncame again. I looked for you lots of times."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t. I had to work. That was our last half-holiday, and--Fifty\r\ncents, madam," she broke off, in answer to a sweet-faced old lady\'s\r\nquestion as to the price of a black-and-white bow on the counter.\r\n\r\n"Fifty cents? Hm-m!" The old lady fingered the bow, hesitated, then\r\nlaid it down with a sigh. "Hm, yes; well, it\'s very pretty, I\'m sure,\r\nmy dear," she said, as she passed on.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind her came two bright-faced girls who, with much\r\ngiggling and bantering, picked out a jeweled creation of scarlet\r\nvelvet, and a fairy-like structure of tulle and pink buds. As the\r\ngirls turned chattering away Pollyanna drew an ecstatic sigh.\r\n\r\n"Is this what you do all day? My, how glad you must be you chose\r\nthis!"\r\n\r\n"GLAD!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It must be such fun--such lots of folks, you know, and all\r\ndifferent! And you can talk to \'em. You HAVE to talk to \'em--it\'s your\r\nbusiness. I should love that. I think I\'ll do this when I grow up. It\r\nmust be such fun to see what they all buy!"\r\n\r\n"Fun! Glad!" bristled the girl behind the counter. "Well, child, I\r\nguess if you knew half--That\'s a dollar, madam," she interrupted\r\nherself hastily, in answer to a young woman\'s sharp question as to the\r\nprice of a flaring yellow bow of beaded velvet in the show case.\r\n\r\n"Well, I should think \'twas time you told me," snapped the young\r\nwoman. "I had to ask you twice."\r\n\r\nThe girl behind the counter bit her lip.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t hear you, madam."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help that. It is your business TO hear. You are paid for it,\r\naren\'t you? How much is that black one?"\r\n\r\n"Fifty cents."\r\n\r\n"And that blue one?"\r\n\r\n"One dollar."\r\n\r\n"No impudence, miss! You needn\'t be so short about it, or I shall\r\nreport you. Let me see that tray of pink ones."\r\n\r\nThe salesgirl\'s lips opened, then closed in a thin, straight line.\r\nObediently she reached into the show case and took out the tray of\r\npink bows; but her eyes flashed, and her hands shook visibly as she\r\nset the tray down on the counter. The young woman whom she was serving\r\npicked up five bows, asked the price of four of them, then turned away\r\nwith a brief:\r\n\r\n"I see nothing I care for."\r\n\r\n"Well," said the girl behind the counter, in a shaking voice, to the\r\nwide-eyed Pollyanna, "what do you think of my business now? Anything\r\nto be glad about there?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna giggled a little hysterically.\r\n\r\n"My, wasn\'t she cross? But she was kind of funny, too--don\'t you\r\nthink? Anyhow, you can be glad that--that they aren\'t ALL like HER,\r\ncan\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," said the girl, with a faint smile, "But I can tell you\r\nright now, kiddie, that glad game of yours you was tellin\' me about\r\nthat day in the Garden may be all very well for you; but--" Once more\r\nshe stopped with a tired: "Fifty cents, madam," in answer to a\r\nquestion from the other side of the counter.\r\n\r\n"Are you as lonesome as ever?" asked Pollyanna wistfully, when the\r\nsalesgirl was at liberty again.\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t say I\'ve given more\'n five parties, nor been to more\'n\r\nseven, since I saw you," replied the girl so bitterly that Pollyanna\r\ndetected the sarcasm.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but you did something nice Christmas, didn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I stayed in bed all day with my feet done up in rags and\r\nread four newspapers and one magazine. Then at night I hobbled out to\r\na restaurant where I had to blow in thirty-five cents for chicken pie\r\ninstead of a quarter."\r\n\r\n"But what ailed your feet?"\r\n\r\n"Blistered. Standin\' on \'em--Christmas rush."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" shuddered Pollyanna, sympathetically. "And you didn\'t have any\r\ntree, or party, or anything?" she cried, distressed and shocked.\r\n\r\n"Well, hardly!"\r\n\r\n"O dear! How I wish you could have seen mine!" sighed the little girl.\r\n"It was just lovely, and--But, oh, say!" she exclaimed joyously. "You\r\ncan see it, after all. It isn\'t gone yet. Now, can\'t you come out\r\nto-night, or to-morrow night, and--"\r\n\r\n"PollyANNA!" interrupted Mrs. Carew in her chilliest accents. "What in\r\nthe world does this mean? Where have you been? I have looked\r\neverywhere for you. I even went \'way back to the suit department."\r\n\r\nPollyanna turned with a happy little cry.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Carew, I\'m so glad you\'ve come," she rejoiced. "This\r\nis--well, I don\'t know her name yet, but I know HER, so it\'s all\r\nright. I met her in the Public Garden ever so long ago. And she\'s\r\nlonesome, and doesn\'t know anybody. And her father was a minister like\r\nmine, only he\'s alive. And she didn\'t have any Christmas tree only\r\nblistered feet and chicken pie; and I want her to see mine, you\r\nknow--the tree, I mean," plunged on Pollyanna, breathlessly. "I\'ve\r\nasked her to come out to-night, or to-morrow night. And you\'ll let me\r\nhave it all lighted up again, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'I don\'t know her name yet, but I know HER, so it\'s\r\nall right\'"]\r\n\r\n"Well, really, Pollyanna," began Mrs. Carew, in cold disapproval. But\r\nthe girl behind the counter interrupted with a voice quite as cold,\r\nand even more disapproving.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, madam. I\'ve no notion of goin\'."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but PLEASE," begged Pollyanna. "You don\'t know how I want you,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"I notice the lady ain\'t doin\' any askin\'," interrupted the salesgirl,\r\na little maliciously.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew flushed an angry red, and turned as if to go; but Pollyanna\r\ncaught her arm and held it, talking meanwhile almost frenziedly to the\r\ngirl behind the counter, who happened, at the moment, to be free from\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but she will, she will," Pollyanna was saying. "She wants you to\r\ncome--I know she does. Why, you don\'t know how good she is, and how\r\nmuch money she gives to--to charitable \'sociations and everything."\r\n\r\n"PollyANNA!" remonstrated Mrs. Carew, sharply. Once more she would\r\nhave gone, but this time she was held spellbound by the ringing scorn\r\nin the low, tense voice of the salesgirl.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I know! There\'s lots of \'em that\'ll give to RESCUE work.\r\nThere\'s always plenty of helpin\' hands stretched out to them that has\r\ngone wrong. And that\'s all right. I ain\'t findin\' no fault with that.\r\nOnly sometimes I wonder there don\'t some of \'em think of helpin\' the\r\ngirls BEFORE they go wrong. Why don\'t they give GOOD girls pretty\r\nhomes with books and pictures and soft carpets and music, and somebody\r\n\'round \'em to care? Maybe then there wouldn\'t be so many--Good\r\nheavens, what am I sayin\'?" she broke off, under her breath. Then,\r\nwith the old weariness, she turned to a young woman who had stopped\r\nbefore her and picked up a blue bow.\r\n\r\n"That\'s fifty cents, madam," Mrs. Carew heard, as she hurried\r\nPollyanna away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA WAITING AND A WINNING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a delightful plan. Pollyanna had it entirely formulated in\r\nabout five minutes; then she told Mrs. Carew. Mrs. Carew did not think\r\nit was a delightful plan, and she said so very distinctly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I\'m sure THEY\'LL think it is," argued Pollyanna, in reply to\r\nMrs. Carew\'s objections. "And just think how easy we can do it! The\r\ntree is just as it was--except for the presents, and we can get more\r\nof those. It won\'t be so very long till just New Year\'s Eve; and only\r\nthink how glad she\'ll be to come! Wouldn\'t YOU be, if you hadn\'t had\r\nanything for Christmas only blistered feet and chicken pie?"\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, what an impossible child you are!" frowned Mrs. Carew.\r\n"Even yet it doesn\'t seem to occur to you that we don\'t know this\r\nyoung person\'s name."\r\n\r\n"So we don\'t! And isn\'t it funny, when I feel that I know HER so\r\nwell?" smiled Pollyanna. "You see, we had such a good talk in the\r\nGarden that day, and she told me all about how lonesome she was, and\r\nthat she thought the lonesomest place in the world was in a crowd in a\r\nbig city, because folks didn\'t think nor notice. Oh, there was one\r\nthat noticed; but he noticed too much, she said, and he hadn\'t ought\r\nto notice her any--which is kind of funny, isn\'t it, when you come to\r\nthink of it. But anyhow, he came for her there in the Garden to go\r\nsomewhere with him, and she wouldn\'t go, and he was a real handsome\r\ngentleman, too--until he began to look so cross, just at the last.\r\nFolks aren\'t so pretty when they\'re cross, are they? Now there was a\r\nlady to-day looking at bows, and she said--well, lots of things that\r\nweren\'t nice, you know. And SHE didn\'t look pretty, either,\r\nafter--after she began to talk. But you will let me have the tree New\r\nYear\'s Eve, won\'t you, Mrs. Carew?--and invite this girl who sells\r\nbows, and Jamie? He\'s better, you know, now, and he COULD come. Of\r\ncourse Jerry would have to wheel him--but then, we\'d want Jerry,\r\nanyway."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course, JERRY!" exclaimed Mrs. Carew in ironic scorn. "But why\r\nstop with Jerry? I\'m sure Jerry has hosts of friends who would love to\r\ncome. And--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Carew, MAY I?" broke in Pollyanna, in uncontrollable\r\ndelight. "Oh, how good, GOOD, GOOD you are! I\'ve so wanted--" But Mrs.\r\nCarew fairly gasped aloud in surprise and dismay.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Pollyanna, I--" she began, protestingly. But Pollyanna,\r\nentirely mistaking the meaning of her interruption, plunged in again\r\nin stout championship.\r\n\r\n"Indeed you ARE good--just the bestest ever; and I sha\'n\'t let you say\r\nyou aren\'t. Now I reckon I\'ll have a party all right! There\'s Tommy\r\nDolan and his sister Jennie, and the two Macdonald children, and three\r\ngirls whose names I don\'t know that live under the Murphys, and a\r\nwhole lot more, if we have room for \'em. And only think how glad\r\nthey\'ll be when I tell \'em! Why, Mrs. Carew, seems to me as if I never\r\nknew anything so perfectly lovely in all my life--and it\'s all your\r\ndoings! Now mayn\'t I begin right away to invite \'em--so they\'ll KNOW\r\nwhat\'s coming to \'em?"\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Carew, who would not have believed such a thing possible,\r\nheard herself murmuring a faint "yes," which, she knew, bound her to\r\nthe giving of a Christmas-tree party on New Year\'s Eve to a dozen\r\nchildren from Murphy\'s Alley and a young salesgirl whose name she did\r\nnot know.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in Mrs. Carew\'s memory was still lingering a young girl\'s\r\n"Sometimes I wonder there don\'t some of \'em think of helpin\' the girls\r\nBEFORE they go wrong." Perhaps in her ears was still ringing\r\nPollyanna\'s story of that same girl who had found a crowd in a big\r\ncity the loneliest place in the world, yet who had refused to go with\r\nthe handsome man that had "noticed too much." Perhaps in Mrs. Carew\'s\r\nheart was the undefined hope that somewhere in it all lay the peace\r\nshe had so longed for. Perhaps it was a little of all three combined\r\nwith utter helplessness in the face of Pollyanna\'s amazing twisting of\r\nher irritated sarcasm into the wide-sweeping hospitality of a willing\r\nhostess. Whatever it was, the thing was done; and at once Mrs. Carew\r\nfound herself caught into a veritable whirl of plans and plottings,\r\nthe center of which was always Pollyanna and the party.\r\n\r\nTo her sister, Mrs. Carew wrote distractedly of the whole affair,\r\nclosing with:\r\n\r\n"What I\'m going to do I don\'t know; but I suppose I shall have to keep\r\nright on doing as I am doing. There is no other way. Of course, if\r\nPollyanna once begins to preach--but she hasn\'t yet; so I can\'t, with\r\na clear conscience, send her back to you."\r\n\r\nDella, reading this letter at the Sanatorium, laughed aloud at the\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n"\'Hasn\'t preached yet,\' indeed!" she chuckled to herself. "Bless her\r\ndear heart! And yet you, Ruth Carew, own up to giving two\r\nChristmas-tree parties within a week, and, as I happen to know, your\r\nhome, which used to be shrouded in death-like gloom, is aflame with\r\nscarlet and green from top to toe. But she hasn\'t preached yet--oh,\r\nno, she hasn\'t preached yet!"\r\n\r\nThe party was a great success. Even Mrs. Carew admitted that. Jamie,\r\nin his wheel chair, Jerry with his startling, but expressive\r\nvocabulary, and the girl (whose name proved to be Sadie Dean), vied\r\nwith each other in amusing the more diffident guests. Sadie Dean, much\r\nto the others\' surprise--and perhaps to her own--disclosed an intimate\r\nknowledge of the most fascinating games; and these games, with Jamie\'s\r\nstories and Jerry\'s good-natured banter, kept every one in gales of\r\nlaughter until supper and the generous distribution of presents from\r\nthe laden tree sent the happy guests home with tired sighs of content.\r\n\r\nIf Jamie (who with Jerry was the last to leave) looked about him a bit\r\nwistfully, no one apparently noticed it. Yet Mrs. Carew, when she bade\r\nhim good-night, said low in his ear, half impatiently, half\r\nembarrassedly:\r\n\r\n"Well, Jamie, have you changed your mind--about coming?"\r\n\r\nThe boy hesitated. A faint color stole into his cheeks. He turned and\r\nlooked into her eyes wistfully, searchingly. Then very slowly he shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"If it could always be--like to-night, I--could," he sighed. "But it\r\nwouldn\'t. There\'d be to-morrow, and next week, and next month, and\r\nnext year comin\'; and I\'d know before next week that I hadn\'t oughter\r\ncome."\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. Carew had thought that the New Year\'s Eve party was to end the\r\nmatter of Pollyanna\'s efforts in behalf of Sadie Dean, she was soon\r\nundeceived; for the very next morning Pollyanna began to talk of her.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m so glad I found her again," she prattled contentedly. "Even\r\nif I haven\'t been able to find the real Jamie for you, I\'ve found\r\nsomebody else for you to love--and of course you\'ll love to love her,\r\n\'cause it\'s just another way of loving Jamie."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew drew in her breath and gave a little gasp of exasperation.\r\nThis unfailing faith in her goodness of heart, and unhesitating belief\r\nin her desire to "help everybody" was most disconcerting, and\r\nsometimes most annoying. At the same time it was a most difficult\r\nthing to disclaim--under the circumstances, especially with\r\nPollyanna\'s happy, confident eyes full on her face.\r\n\r\n"But, Pollyanna," she objected impotently, at last, feeling very much\r\nas if she were struggling against invisible silken cords,\r\n"I--you--this girl really isn\'t Jamie, at all, you know."\r\n\r\n"I know she isn\'t," sympathized Pollyanna quickly. "And of course I\'m\r\njust as sorry she ISN\'T Jamie as can be. But she\'s somebody\'s\r\nJamie--that is, I mean she hasn\'t got anybody down here to love her\r\nand--and notice, you know; and so whenever you remember Jamie I should\r\nthink you couldn\'t be glad enough there was SOMEBODY you could help,\r\njust as you\'d want folks to help Jamie, wherever HE is."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew shivered and gave a little moan.\r\n\r\n"But I want MY Jamie," she grieved.\r\n\r\nPollyanna nodded with understanding eyes.\r\n\r\n"I know--the \'child\'s presence.\' Mr. Pendleton told me about it--only\r\nyou\'ve GOT the \'woman\'s hand.\'"\r\n\r\n"\'Woman\'s hand\'?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--to make a home, you know. He said that it took a woman\'s hand or\r\na child\'s presence to make a home. That was when he wanted me, and I\r\nfound him Jimmy, and he adopted him instead."\r\n\r\n"JIMMY?" Mrs. Carew looked up with the startled something in her eyes\r\nthat always came into them at the mention of any variant of that name.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Jimmy Bean."\r\n\r\n"Oh--BEAN," said Mrs. Carew, relaxing.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He was from an Orphan\'s Home, and he ran away. I found him. He\r\nsaid he wanted another kind of a home with a mother in it instead of a\r\nMatron. I couldn\'t find him the mother-part, but I found him Mr.\r\nPendleton, and he adopted him. His name is Jimmy Pendleton now."\r\n\r\n"But it was--Bean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was Bean."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Mrs. Carew, this time with a long sigh.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew saw a good deal of Sadie Dean during the days that followed\r\nthe New Year\'s Eve party. She saw a good deal of Jamie, too. In one\r\nway and another Pollyanna contrived to have them frequently at the\r\nhouse; and this, Mrs. Carew, much to her surprise and vexation, could\r\nnot seem to prevent. Her consent and even her delight were taken by\r\nPollyanna as so much a matter of course that she found herself\r\nhelpless to convince the child that neither approval nor satisfaction\r\nentered into the matter at all, as far as she was concerned.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Carew, whether she herself realized it or not, was learning\r\nmany things--things she never could have learned in the old days, shut\r\nup in her rooms, with orders to Mary to admit no one. She was learning\r\nsomething of what it means to be a lonely young girl in a big city,\r\nwith one\'s living to earn, and with no one to care--except one who\r\ncares too much, and too little.\r\n\r\n"But what did you mean?" she nervously asked Sadie Dean one evening;\r\n"what did you mean that first day in the store--what you said--about\r\nhelping the girls?"\r\n\r\nSadie Dean colored distressfully.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I was rude," she apologized.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that. Tell me what you meant. I\'ve thought of it so many\r\ntimes since."\r\n\r\nFor a moment the girl was silent; then, a little bitterly she said:\r\n\r\n"\'Twas because I knew a girl once, and I was thinkin\' of her. She came\r\nfrom my town, and she was pretty and good, but she wa\'n\'t over strong.\r\nFor a year we pulled together, sharin\' the same room, boiling our eggs\r\nover the same gas-jet, and eatin\' our hash and fish balls for supper\r\nat the same cheap restaurant. There was never anything to do evenin\'s\r\nbut to walk in the Common, or go to the movies, if we had the dime to\r\nblow in, or just stay in our room. Well, our room wasn\'t very\r\npleasant. It was hot in summer, and cold in winter, and the gas-jet\r\nwas so measly and so flickery that we couldn\'t sew or read, even if we\r\nhadn\'t been too fagged out to do either--which we \'most generally was.\r\nBesides, over our heads was a squeaky board that some one was always\r\nrockin\' on, and under us was a feller that was learnin\' to play the\r\ncornet. Did you ever hear any one learn to play the cornet?"\r\n\r\n"N-no, I don\'t think so," murmured Mrs. Carew.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ve missed a lot," said the girl, dryly. Then, after a\r\nmoment, she resumed her story.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes, \'specially at Christmas and holidays, we used to walk up\r\nhere on the Avenue, and other streets, huntin\' for windows where the\r\ncurtains were up, and we could look in. You see, we were pretty\r\nlonesome, them days \'specially, and we said it did us good to see\r\nhomes with folks, and lamps on the center-tables, and children playin\'\r\ngames; but we both of us knew that really it only made us feel worse\r\nthan ever, because we were so hopelessly out of it all. \'Twas even\r\nharder to see the automobiles, and the gay young folks in them,\r\nlaughing and chatting. You see, we were young, and I suspect we wanted\r\nto laugh and chatter. We wanted a good time, too; and, by and by--my\r\nchum began to have it--this good time.\r\n\r\n"Well, to make a long story short, we broke partnership one day, and\r\nshe went her way, and I mine. I didn\'t like the company she was\r\nkeepin\', and I said so. She wouldn\'t give \'em up, so we quit. I didn\'t\r\nsee her again for \'most two years, then I got a note from her, and I\r\nwent. This was just last month. She was in one of them rescue homes.\r\nIt was a lovely place; soft rugs, fine pictures, plants, flowers, and\r\nbooks, a piano, a beautiful room, and everything possible done for\r\nher. Rich women came in their automobiles and carriages to take her\r\ndriving, and she was taken to concerts and matinees. She was learnin\'\r\nstenography, and they were going to help her to a position just as\r\nsoon as she could take it. Everybody was wonderfully good to her, she\r\nsaid, and showed they wanted to help her in every way. But she said\r\nsomething else, too. She said:\r\n\r\n"\'Sadie, if they\'d taken one half the pains to show me they cared and\r\nwanted to help long ago when I was an honest, self-respectin\',\r\nhard-workin\' homesick girl--I wouldn\'t have been here for them to help\r\nnow.\' And--well, I never forgot it. That\'s all. It ain\'t that I\'m\r\nobjectin\' to the rescue work--it\'s a fine thing, and they ought to do\r\nit. Only I\'m thinkin\' there wouldn\'t be quite so much of it for them\r\nto do--if they\'d just show a little of their interest earlier in the\r\ngame."\r\n\r\n"But I thought--there were working-girls\' homes, and--and\r\nsettlement-houses that--that did that sort of thing," faltered Mrs.\r\nCarew in a voice that few of her friends would have recognized.\r\n\r\n"There are. Did you ever see the inside of one of them?"\r\n\r\n"Why, n-no; though I--I have given money to them." This time Mrs.\r\nCarew\'s voice was almost apologetically pleading in tone.\r\n\r\nSadie Dean smiled curiously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. There are lots of good women that have given money to\r\nthem--and have never seen the inside of one of them. Please don\'t\r\nunderstand that I\'m sayin\' anythin\' against the homes. I\'m not.\r\nThey\'re good things. They\'re almost the only thing that\'s doing\r\nanything to help; but they\'re only a drop in the bucket to what is\r\nreally needed. I tried one once; but there was an air about\r\nit--somehow I felt-- But there, what\'s the use? Probably they aren\'t\r\nall like that one, and maybe the fault was with me. If I should try to\r\ntell you, you wouldn\'t understand. You\'d have to live in it--and you\r\nhaven\'t even seen the inside of one. But I can\'t help wonderin\'\r\nsometimes why so many of those good women never seem to put the real\r\nHEART and INTEREST into the preventin\' that they do into the rescuin\'.\r\nBut there! I didn\'t mean to talk such a lot. But--you asked me."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I asked you," said Mrs. Carew in a half-stifled voice, as she\r\nturned away.\r\n\r\nNot only from Sadie Dean, however, was Mrs. Carew learning things\r\nnever learned before, but from Jamie, also.\r\n\r\nJamie was there a great deal. Pollyanna liked to have him there, and\r\nhe liked to be there. At first, to be sure, he had hesitated; but very\r\nsoon he had quieted his doubts and yielded to his longings by telling\r\nhimself (and Pollyanna) that, after all, visiting was not "staying for\r\nkeeps."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew often found the boy and Pollyanna contentedly settled on\r\nthe library window-seat, with the empty wheel chair close by.\r\nSometimes they were poring over a book. (She heard Jamie tell\r\nPollyanna one day that he didn\'t think he\'d mind so very much being\r\nlame if he had so many books as Mrs. Carew, and that he guessed he\'d\r\nbe so happy he\'d fly clean away if he had both books and legs.)\r\nSometimes the boy was telling stories, and Pollyanna was listening,\r\nwide-eyed and absorbed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew wondered at Pollyanna\'s interest--until one day she herself\r\nstopped and listened. After that she wondered no longer--but she\r\nlistened a good deal longer. Crude and incorrect as was much of the\r\nboy\'s language, it was always wonderfully vivid and picturesque, so\r\nthat Mrs. Carew found herself, hand in hand with Pollyanna, trailing\r\ndown the Golden Ages at the beck of a glowing-eyed boy.\r\n\r\nDimly Mrs. Carew was beginning to realize, too, something of what it\r\nmust mean, to be in spirit and ambition the center of brave deeds and\r\nwonderful adventures, while in reality one was only a crippled boy in\r\na wheel chair. But what Mrs. Carew did not realize was the part this\r\ncrippled boy was beginning to play in her own life. She did not\r\nrealize how much a matter of course his presence was becoming, nor how\r\ninterested she now was in finding something new "for Jamie to see."\r\nNeither did she realize how day by day he was coming to seem to her\r\nmore and more the lost Jamie, her dead sister\'s child.\r\n\r\nAs February, March, and April passed, however, and May came, bringing\r\nwith it the near approach of the date set for Pollyanna\'s home-going,\r\nMrs. Carew did suddenly awake to the knowledge of what that home-going\r\nwas to mean to her.\r\n\r\nShe was amazed and appalled. Up to now she had, in belief, looked\r\nforward with pleasure to the departure of Pollyanna. She had said that\r\nthen once again the house would be quiet, with the glaring sun shut\r\nout. Once again she would be at peace, and able to hide herself away\r\nfrom the annoying, tiresome world. Once again she would be free to\r\nsummon to her aching consciousness all those dear memories of the lost\r\nlittle lad who had so long ago stepped into that vast unknown and\r\nclosed the door behind him. All this she had believed would be the\r\ncase when Pollyanna should go home.\r\n\r\nBut now that Pollyanna was really going home, the picture was far\r\ndifferent. The "quiet house with the sun shut out" had become one that\r\npromised to be "gloomy and unbearable." The longed-for "peace" would\r\nbe "wretched loneliness"; and as for her being able to "hide herself\r\naway from the annoying, tiresome world," and "free to summon to her\r\naching consciousness all those dear memories of that lost little\r\nlad"--just as if anything could blot out those other aching memories\r\nof the new Jamie (who yet might be the old Jamie) with his pitiful,\r\npleading eyes!\r\n\r\nFull well now Mrs. Carew knew that without Pollyanna the house would\r\nbe empty; but that without the lad, Jamie, it would be worse than\r\nthat. To her pride this knowledge was not pleasing. To her heart it\r\nwas torture--since the boy had twice said that he would not come. For\r\na time, during those last few days of Pollyanna\'s stay, the struggle\r\nwas a bitter one, though pride always kept the ascendancy. Then, on\r\nwhat Mrs. Carew knew would be Jamie\'s last visit, her heart triumphed,\r\nand once more she asked Jamie to come and be to her the Jamie that was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nWhat she said she never could remember afterwards; but what the boy\r\nsaid, she never forgot. After all, it was compassed in six short\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nFor what seemed a long, long minute his eyes had searched her face;\r\nthen to his own had come a transfiguring light, as he breathed:\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! Why, you--CARE, now!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nJIMMY AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time Beldingsville did not literally welcome Pollyanna home with\r\nbrass bands and bunting--perhaps because the hour of her expected\r\narrival was known to but few of the townspeople. But there certainly\r\nwas no lack of joyful greetings on the part of everybody from the\r\nmoment she stepped from the railway train with her Aunt Polly and Dr.\r\nChilton. Nor did Pollyanna lose any time in starting on a round of\r\nfly-away minute calls on all her old friends. Indeed, for the next few\r\ndays, according to Nancy, "There wasn\'t no putting of your finger on\r\nher anywheres, for by the time you\'d got your finger down she wa\'n\'t\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nAnd always, everywhere she went, Pollyanna met the question: "Well,\r\nhow did you like Boston?" Perhaps to no one did she answer this more\r\nfully than she did to Mr. Pendleton. As was usually the case when this\r\nquestion was put to her, she began her reply with a troubled frown.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I liked it--I just loved it--some of it."\r\n\r\n"But not all of it?" smiled Mr. Pendleton.\r\n\r\n"No. There\'s parts of it--Oh, I was glad to be there," she explained\r\nhastily. "I had a perfectly lovely time, and lots of things were so\r\nqueer and different, you know--like eating dinner at night instead of\r\nnoons, when you ought to eat it. But everybody was so good to me, and\r\nI saw such a lot of wonderful things--Bunker Hill, and the Public\r\nGarden, and the Seeing Boston autos, and miles of pictures and statues\r\nand store-windows and streets that didn\'t have any end. And folks. I\r\nnever saw such a lot of folks."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m sure--I thought you liked folks," commented the man.\r\n\r\n"I do." Pollyanna frowned again and pondered. "But what\'s the use of\r\nsuch a lot of them if you don\'t know \'em? And Mrs. Carew wouldn\'t let\r\nme. She didn\'t know \'em herself. She said folks didn\'t, down there."\r\n\r\nThere was a slight pause, then, with a sigh, Pollyanna resumed.\r\n\r\n"I reckon maybe that\'s the part I don\'t like the most--that folks\r\ndon\'t know each other. It would be such a lot nicer if they did! Why,\r\njust think, Mr. Pendleton, there are lots of folks that live on dirty,\r\nnarrow streets, and don\'t even have beans and fish balls to eat, nor\r\nthings even as good as missionary barrels to wear. Then there are\r\nother folks--Mrs. Carew, and a whole lot like her--that live in\r\nperfectly beautiful houses, and have more things to eat and wear than\r\nthey know what to do with. Now if THOSE folks only knew the other\r\nfolks--" But Mr. Pendleton interrupted with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"My dear child, did it ever occur to you that these people don\'t CARE\r\nto know each other?" he asked quizzically.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but some of them do," maintained Pollyanna, in eager defense.\r\n"Now there\'s Sadie Dean--she sells bows, lovely bows in a big\r\nstore--she WANTS to know people; and I introduced her to Mrs. Carew,\r\nand we had her up to the house, and we had Jamie and lots of others\r\nthere, too; and she was SO glad to know them! And that\'s what made me\r\nthink that if only a lot of Mrs. Carew\'s kind could know the other\r\nkind--but of course _I_ couldn\'t do the introducing. I didn\'t know\r\nmany of them myself, anyway. But if they COULD know each other, so\r\nthat the rich people could give the poor people part of their money--"\r\n\r\nBut again Mr. Pendleton interrupted with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pollyanna, Pollyanna," he chuckled; "I\'m afraid you\'re getting\r\ninto pretty deep water. You\'ll be a rabid little socialist before you\r\nknow it."\r\n\r\n"A--what?" questioned the little girl, dubiously. "I--I don\'t think I\r\nknow what a socialist is. But I know what being SOCIABLE is--and I\r\nlike folks that are that. If it\'s anything like that, I don\'t mind\r\nbeing one, a mite. I\'d like to be one."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t doubt it, Pollyanna," smiled the man. "But when it comes to\r\nthis scheme of yours for the wholesale distribution of wealth--you\'ve\r\ngot a problem on your hands that you might have difficulty with."\r\n\r\nPollyanna drew a long sigh.\r\n\r\n"I know," she nodded. "That\'s the way Mrs. Carew talked. She says I\r\ndon\'t understand; that \'twould--er--pauperize her and be\r\nindiscriminate and pernicious, and--Well, it was SOMETHING like that,\r\nanyway," bridled the little girl, aggrievedly, as the man began to\r\nlaugh. "And, anyway, I DON\'T understand why some folks should have\r\nsuch a lot, and other folks shouldn\'t have anything; and I DON\'T like\r\nit. And if I ever have a lot I shall just give some of it to folks who\r\ndon\'t have any, even if it does make me pauperized and pernicious,\r\nand--" But Mr. Pendleton was laughing so hard now that Pollyanna,\r\nafter a moment\'s struggle, surrendered and laughed with him.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway," she reiterated, when she had caught her breath, "I\r\ndon\'t understand it, all the same."\r\n\r\n"No, dear, I\'m afraid you don\'t," agreed the man, growing suddenly\r\nvery grave and tender-eyed; "nor any of the rest of us, for that\r\nmatter. But, tell me," he added, after a minute, "who is this Jamie\r\nyou\'ve been talking so much about since you came?"\r\n\r\nAnd Pollyanna told him.\r\n\r\nIn talking of Jamie, Pollyanna lost her worried, baffled look.\r\nPollyanna loved to talk of Jamie. Here was something she understood.\r\nHere was no problem that had to deal with big, fearsome-sounding\r\nwords. Besides, in this particular instance--would not Mr. Pendleton\r\nbe especially interested in Mrs. Carew\'s taking the boy into her home,\r\nfor who better than himself could understand the need of a child\'s\r\npresence?\r\n\r\nFor that matter, Pollyanna talked to everybody about Jamie. She\r\nassumed that everybody would be as interested as she herself was. On\r\nmost occasions she was not disappointed in the interest shown; but one\r\nday she met with a surprise. It came through Jimmy Pendleton.\r\n\r\n"Say, look a-here," he demanded one afternoon, irritably. "Wasn\'t\r\nthere ANYBODY else down to Boston but just that everlasting \'Jamie\'?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Jimmy Bean, what do you mean?" cried Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nThe boy lifted his chin a little.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not Jimmy Bean. I\'m Jimmy Pendleton. And I mean that I should\r\nthink, from your talk, that there wasn\'t ANYBODY down to Boston but\r\njust that loony boy who calls them birds and squirrels \'Lady\r\nLancelot,\' and all that tommyrot."\r\n\r\n"Why, Jimmy Be--Pendleton!" gasped Pollyanna. Then, with some spirit:\r\n"Jamie isn\'t loony! He is a very nice boy. And he knows a lot--books\r\nand stories! Why, he can MAKE stories right out of his own head!\r\nBesides, it isn\'t \'Lady Lancelot,\'--it\'s \'Sir Lancelot.\' If you knew\r\nhalf as much as he does you\'d know that, too!" she finished, with\r\nflashing eyes.\r\n\r\nJimmy Pendleton flushed miserably and looked utterly wretched. Growing\r\nmore and more jealous moment by moment, still doggedly he held his\r\nground.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyhow," he scoffed, "I don\'t think much of his name. \'Jamie\'!\r\nHumph!--sounds sissy! And I know somebody else that said so, too."\r\n\r\n"Who was it?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n"WHO WAS IT?" demanded Pollyanna, more peremptorily.\r\n\r\n"Dad." The boy\'s voice was sullen.\r\n\r\n"Your--dad?" repeated Pollyanna, in amazement. "Why, how could he know\r\nJamie?"\r\n\r\n"He didn\'t. \'Twasn\'t about that Jamie. \'Twas about me." The boy still\r\nspoke sullenly, with his eyes turned away. Yet there was a curious\r\nsoftness in his voice that was always noticeable whenever he spoke of\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n"YOU!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. \'Twas just a little while before he died. We stopped \'most a\r\nweek with a farmer. Dad helped about the hayin\'--and I did, too, some.\r\nThe farmer\'s wife was awful good to me, and pretty quick she was\r\ncallin\' me \'Jamie.\' I don\'t know why, but she just did. And one day\r\nfather heard her. He got awful mad--so mad that I remembered it\r\nalways--what he said. He said \'Jamie\' wasn\'t no sort of a name for a\r\nboy, and that no son of his should ever be called it. He said \'twas a\r\nsissy name, and he hated it. \'Seems so I never saw him so mad as he\r\nwas that night. He wouldn\'t even stay to finish the work, but him and\r\nme took to the road again that night. I was kind of sorry, \'cause I\r\nliked her--the farmer\'s wife, I mean. She was good to me."\r\n\r\nPollyanna nodded, all sympathy and interest. It was not often that\r\nJimmy said much of that mysterious past life of his, before she had\r\nknown him.\r\n\r\n"And what happened next?" she prompted. Pollyanna had, for the moment,\r\nforgotten all about the original subject of the controversy--the name\r\n"Jamie" that was dubbed "sissy."\r\n\r\nThe boy sighed.\r\n\r\n"We just went on till we found another place. And \'twas there\r\ndad--died. Then they put me in the \'sylum."\r\n\r\n"And then you ran away and I found you that day, down by Mrs. Snow\'s,"\r\nexulted Pollyanna, softly. "And I\'ve known you ever since."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--and you\'ve known me ever since," repeated Jimmy--but in a\r\nfar different voice: Jimmy had suddenly come back to the present, and\r\nto his grievance. "But, then, I ain\'t \'JAMIE,\' you know," he finished\r\nwith scornful emphasis, as he turned loftily away, leaving a\r\ndistressed, bewildered Pollyanna behind him.\r\n\r\n"Well, anyway, I can be glad he doesn\'t always act like this," sighed\r\nthe little girl, as she mournfully watched the sturdy, boyish figure\r\nwith its disagreeable, amazing swagger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nAUNT POLLY TAKES ALARM\r\n\r\n\r\nPollyanna had been at home about a week when the letter from Della\r\nWetherby came to Mrs. Chilton.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could make you see what your little niece has done for my\r\nsister," wrote Miss Wetherby; "but I\'m afraid I can\'t. You would have\r\nto know what she was before. You did see her, to be sure, and perhaps\r\nyou saw something of the hush and gloom in which she has shrouded\r\nherself for so many years. But you can have no conception of her\r\nbitterness of heart, her lack of aim and interest, her insistence upon\r\neternal mourning.\r\n\r\n"Then came Pollyanna. Probably I didn\'t tell you, but my sister\r\nregretted her promise to take the child, almost the minute it was\r\ngiven; and she made the stern stipulation that the moment Pollyanna\r\nbegan to preach, back she should come to me. Well, she hasn\'t\r\npreached--at least, my sister says she hasn\'t; and my sister ought to\r\nknow. And yet--well, just let me tell you what I found when I went to\r\nsee her yesterday. Perhaps nothing else could give you a better idea\r\nof what that wonderful little Pollyanna of yours has accomplished.\r\n\r\n"To begin with, as I approached the house, I saw that nearly all the\r\nshades were up: they used to be down--\'way down to the sill. The\r\nminute I stepped into the hall I heard music--Parsifal. The\r\ndrawing-rooms were open, and the air was sweet with roses.\r\n\r\n"\'Mrs. Carew and Master Jamie are in the music-room,\' said the maid.\r\nAnd there I found them--my sister, and the youth she has taken into\r\nher home, listening to one of those modern contrivances that can hold\r\nan entire opera company, including the orchestra.\r\n\r\n"The boy was in a wheel chair. He was pale, but plainly beatifically\r\nhappy. My sister looked ten years younger. Her usually colorless\r\ncheeks showed a faint pink, and her eyes glowed and sparkled. A little\r\nlater, after I had talked a few minutes with the boy, my sister and I\r\nwent up-stairs to her own rooms; and there she talked to me--of Jamie.\r\nNot of the old Jamie, as she used to, with tear-wet eyes and hopeless\r\nsighs, but of the new Jamie--and there were no sighs nor tears now.\r\nThere was, instead, the eagerness of enthusiastic interest.\r\n\r\n"\'Della, he\'s wonderful,\' she began. \'Everything that is best in\r\nmusic, art, and literature seems to appeal to him in a perfectly\r\nmarvelous fashion, only, of course, he needs development and training.\r\nThat\'s what I\'m going to see that he gets. A tutor is coming\r\nto-morrow. Of course his language is something awful; at the same\r\ntime, he has read so many good books that his vocabulary is quite\r\namazing--and you should hear the stories he can reel off! Of course in\r\ngeneral education he is very deficient; but he\'s eager to learn, so\r\nthat will soon be remedied. He loves music, and I shall give him what\r\ntraining in that he wishes. I have already put in a stock of carefully\r\nselected records. I wish you could have seen his face when he first\r\nheard that Holy Grail music. He knows all about King Arthur and his\r\nRound Table, and he prattles of knights and lords and ladies as you\r\nand I do of the members of our own family--only sometimes I don\'t know\r\nwhether his Sir Lancelot means the ancient knight or a squirrel in the\r\nPublic Garden. And, Della, I believe he can be made to walk. I\'m going\r\nto have Dr. Ames see him, anyway, and--\'\r\n\r\n"And so on and on she talked, while I sat amazed and tongue-tied, but,\r\noh, so happy! I tell you all this, dear Mrs. Chilton, so you can see\r\nfor yourself how interested she is, how eagerly she is going to watch\r\nthis boy\'s growth and development, and how, in spite of herself, it is\r\nall going to change her attitude toward life. She CAN\'T do what she is\r\ndoing for this boy, Jamie, and not do for herself at the same time.\r\nNever again, I believe, will she be the soured, morose woman she was\r\nbefore. And it\'s all because of Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna! Dear child--and the best part of it is, she is so\r\nunconscious of the whole thing. I don\'t believe even my sister yet\r\nquite realizes what is taking place within her own heart and life, and\r\ncertainly Pollyanna doesn\'t--least of all does she realize the part\r\nshe played in the change.\r\n\r\n"And now, dear Mrs. Chilton, how can I thank you? I know I can\'t; so\r\nI\'m not even going to try. Yet in your heart I believe you know how\r\ngrateful I am to both you and Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n                                    "DELLA WETHERBY."\r\n\r\n"Well, it seems to have worked a cure, all right," smiled Dr. Chilton,\r\nwhen his wife had finished reading the letter to him.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise she lifted a quick, remonstrative hand.\r\n\r\n"Thomas, don\'t, please!" she begged.\r\n\r\n"Why, Polly, what\'s the matter? Aren\'t you glad that--that the\r\nmedicine worked?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton dropped despairingly back in her chair.\r\n\r\n"There you go again, Thomas," she sighed. "Of COURSE I\'m glad that\r\nthis misguided woman has forsaken the error of her ways and found that\r\nshe can be of use to some one. And of course I\'m glad that Pollyanna\r\ndid it. But I am not glad to have that child continually spoken of as\r\nif she were a--a bottle of medicine, or a \'cure.\' Don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! After all, where\'s the harm? I\'ve called Pollyanna a tonic\r\never since I knew her."\r\n\r\n"Harm! Thomas Chilton, that child is growing older every day. Do you\r\nwant to spoil her? Thus far she has been utterly unconscious of her\r\nextraordinary power. And therein lies the secret of her success. The\r\nminute she CONSCIOUSLY sets herself to reform somebody, you know as\r\nwell as I do that she will be simply impossible. Consequently, Heaven\r\nforbid that she ever gets it into her head that she\'s anything like a\r\ncure-all for poor, sick, suffering humanity."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! I wouldn\'t worry," laughed the doctor.\r\n\r\n"But I do worry, Thomas."\r\n\r\n"But, Polly, think of what she\'s done," argued the doctor. "Think of\r\nMrs. Snow and John Pendleton, and quantities of others--why, they\'re\r\nnot the same people at all that they used to be, any more than Mrs.\r\nCarew is. And Pollyanna did do it--bless her heart!"\r\n\r\n"I know she did," nodded Mrs. Polly Chilton, emphatically. "But I\r\ndon\'t want Pollyanna to know she did it! Oh, of course she knows it,\r\nin a way. She knows she taught them to play the glad game with her,\r\nand that they are lots happier in consequence. And that\'s all right.\r\nIt\'s a game--HER game, and they\'re playing it together. To you I will\r\nadmit that Pollyanna has preached to us one of the most powerful\r\nsermons I ever heard; but the minute SHE knows it--well, I don\'t want\r\nher to. That\'s all. And right now let me tell you that I\'ve decided\r\nthat I will go to Germany with you this fall. At first I thought I\r\nwouldn\'t. I didn\'t want to leave Pollyanna--and I\'m not going to leave\r\nher now. I\'m going to take her with me."\r\n\r\n"Take her with us? Good! Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got to. That\'s all. Furthermore, I should be glad to plan to\r\nstay a few years, just as you said you\'d like to. I want to get\r\nPollyanna away, quite away from Beldingsville for a while. I\'d like to\r\nkeep her sweet and unspoiled, if I can. And she shall not get silly\r\nnotions into her head if I can help myself. Why, Thomas Chilton, do we\r\nwant that child made an insufferable little prig?"\r\n\r\n"We certainly don\'t," laughed the doctor. "But, for that matter, I\r\ndon\'t believe anything or anybody could make her so. However, this\r\nGermany idea suits me to a T. You know I didn\'t want to come away when\r\nI did--if it hadn\'t been for Pollyanna. So the sooner we get back\r\nthere the better I\'m satisfied. And I\'d like to stay--for a little\r\npractice, as well as study."\r\n\r\n"Then that\'s settled." And Aunt Polly gave a satisfied sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWHEN POLLYANNA WAS EXPECTED\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Beldingsville was fairly aquiver with excitement. Not since\r\nPollyanna Whittier came home from the Sanatorium, WALKING, had there\r\nbeen such a chatter of talk over back-yard fences and on every street\r\ncorner. To-day, too, the center of interest was Pollyanna. Once again\r\nPollyanna was coming home--but so different a Pollyanna, and so\r\ndifferent a homecoming!\r\n\r\nPollyanna was twenty now. For six years she had spent her winters in\r\nGermany, her summers leisurely traveling with Dr. Chilton and his\r\nwife. Only once during that time had she been in Beldingsville, and\r\nthen it was for but a short four weeks the summer she was sixteen. Now\r\nshe was coming home--to stay, report said; she and her Aunt Polly.\r\n\r\nThe doctor would not be with them. Six months before, the town had\r\nbeen shocked and saddened by the news that the doctor had died\r\nsuddenly. Beldingsville had expected then that Mrs. Chilton and\r\nPollyanna would return at once to the old home. But they had not come.\r\nInstead had come word that the widow and her niece would remain abroad\r\nfor a time. The report said that, in entirely new surroundings, Mrs.\r\nChilton was trying to seek distraction and relief from her great\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nVery soon, however, vague rumors, and rumors not so vague, began to\r\nfloat through the town that, financially, all was not well with Mrs.\r\nPolly Chilton. Certain railroad stocks, in which it was known that the\r\nHarrington estate had been heavily interested, wavered uncertainly,\r\nthen tumbled into ruin and disaster. Other investments, according to\r\nreport, were in a most precarious condition. From the doctor\'s estate,\r\nlittle could be expected. He had not been a rich man, and his expenses\r\nhad been heavy for the past six years. Beldingsville was not\r\nsurprised, therefore, when, not quite six months after the doctor\'s\r\ndeath, word came that Mrs. Chilton and Pollyanna were coming home.\r\n\r\nOnce more the old Harrington homestead, so long closed and silent,\r\nshowed up-flung windows and wide-open doors. Once more Nancy--now Mrs.\r\nTimothy Durgin--swept and scrubbed and dusted until the old place\r\nshone in spotless order.\r\n\r\n"No, I hain\'t had no instructions ter do it; I hain\'t, I hain\'t,"\r\nNancy explained to curious friends and neighbors who halted at the\r\ngate, or came more boldly up to the doorways. "Mother Durgin\'s had the\r\nkey, \'course, and has come in regerler to air up and see that things\r\nwas all right; and Mis\' Chilton just wrote and said she and Miss\r\nPollyanna was comin\' this week Friday, and ter please see that the\r\nrooms and sheets was aired, and ter leave the key under the side-door\r\nmat on that day.\r\n\r\n"Under the mat, indeed! Just as if I\'d leave them two poor things ter\r\ncome into this house alone, and all forlorn like that--and me only a\r\nmile away, a-sittin\' in my own parlor like as if I was a fine lady an\'\r\nhadn\'t no heart at all, at all! Just as if the poor things hadn\'t\r\nenough ter stand without that--a-comin\' into this house an\' the doctor\r\ngone--bless his kind heart!--an\' never comin\' back. An\' no money, too.\r\nDid ye hear about that? An\' ain\'t it a shame, a shame! Think of Miss\r\nPolly--I mean, Mis\' Chilton--bein\' poor! My stars and stockings, I\r\ncan\'t sense it--I can\'t, I can\'t!"\r\n\r\nPerhaps to no one did Nancy speak so interestedly as she did to a\r\ntall, good-looking young fellow with peculiarly frank eyes and a\r\nparticularly winning smile, who cantered up to the side door on a\r\nmettlesome thoroughbred at ten o\'clock that Thursday morning. At the\r\nsame time, to no one did she talk with so much evident embarrassment,\r\nso far as the manner of address was concerned; for her tongue stumbled\r\nand blundered out a "Master Jimmy--er--Mr. Bean--I mean, Mr.\r\nPendleton, Master Jimmy!" with a nervous precipitation that sent the\r\nyoung man himself into a merry peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Nancy! Let it go at whatever comes handiest," he\r\nchuckled. "I\'ve found out what I wanted to know: Mrs. Chilton and her\r\nniece really are expected to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, they be, sir," courtesied Nancy, "--more\'s the pity! Not\r\nbut that I shall be glad enough ter see \'em, you understand, but it\'s\r\nthe WAY they\'re a-comin\'."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. I understand," nodded the youth, gravely, his eyes\r\nsweeping the fine old house before him. "Well, I suppose that part\r\ncan\'t be helped. But I\'m glad you\'re doing--just what you are doing.\r\nThat WILL help a whole lot," he finished with a bright smile, as he\r\nwheeled about and rode rapidly down the driveway.\r\n\r\nBack on the steps Nancy wagged her head wisely.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t surprised, Master Jimmy," she declared aloud, her admiring\r\neyes following the handsome figures of horse and man. "I ain\'t\r\nsurprised that you ain\'t lettin\' no grass grow under your feet \'bout\r\ninquirin\' for Miss Pollyanna. I said long ago \'twould come sometime,\r\nan\' it\'s bound to--what with your growin\' so handsome and tall. An\' I\r\nhope \'twill; I do, I do. It\'ll be just like a book, what with her\r\na-findin\' you an\' gettin\' you into that grand home with Mr. Pendleton.\r\nMy, but who\'d ever take you now for that little Jimmy Bean that used\r\nto be! I never did see such a change in anybody--I didn\'t, I didn\'t!"\r\nshe answered, with one last look at the rapidly disappearing figures\r\nfar down the road.\r\n\r\nSomething of the same thought must have been in the mind of John\r\nPendleton some time later that same morning, for, from the veranda of\r\nhis big gray house on Pendleton Hill, John Pendleton was watching the\r\nrapid approach of that same horse and rider; and in his eyes was an\r\nexpression very like the one that had been in Mrs. Nancy Durgin\'s. On\r\nhis lips, too, was an admiring "Jove! what a handsome pair!" as the\r\ntwo dashed by on the way to the stable.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later the youth came around the corner of the house and\r\nslowly ascended the veranda steps.\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy, is it true? Are they coming?" asked the man, with\r\nvisible eagerness.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow." The young fellow dropped himself into a chair.\r\n\r\nAt the crisp terseness of the answer, John Pendleton frowned. He threw\r\na quick look into the young man\'s face. For a moment he hesitated;\r\nthen, a little abruptly, he asked:\r\n\r\n"Why, son, what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Matter? Nothing, sir."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! I know better. You left here an hour ago so eager to be off\r\nthat wild horses could not have held you. Now you sit humped up in\r\nthat chair and look as if wild horses couldn\'t drag you out of it. If\r\nI didn\'t know better I\'d think you weren\'t glad that our friends are\r\ncoming."\r\n\r\nHe paused, evidently for a reply. But he did not get it.\r\n\r\n"Why, Jim, AREN\'T you glad they\'re coming?"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow laughed and stirred restlessly.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, of course."\r\n\r\n"Humph! You act like it."\r\n\r\nThe youth laughed again. A boyish red flamed into his face.\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s only that I was thinking--of Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna! Why, man alive, you\'ve done nothing but prattle of\r\nPollyanna ever since you came home from Boston and found she was\r\nexpected. I thought you were dying to see Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nThe other leaned forward with curious intentness.\r\n\r\n"That\'s exactly it! See? You said it a minute ago. It\'s just as if\r\nyesterday wild horses couldn\'t keep me from seeing Pollyanna; and now,\r\nto-day, when I know she\'s coming--they couldn\'t drag me to see her."\r\n\r\n"Why, JIM!"\r\n\r\nAt the shocked incredulity on John Pendleton\'s face, the younger man\r\nfell back in his chair with an embarrassed laugh.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. It sounds nutty, and I don\'t expect I can make you\r\nunderstand. But, somehow, I don\'t think--I ever wanted Pollyanna to\r\ngrow up. She was such a dear, just as she was. I like to think of her\r\nas I saw her last, her earnest, freckled little face, her yellow\r\npigtails, her tearful: \'Oh, yes, I\'m glad I\'m going; but I think I\r\nshall be a little gladder when I come back.\' That\'s the last time I\r\nsaw her. You know we were in Egypt that time she was here four years\r\nago."\r\n\r\n"I know. I see exactly what you mean, too. I think I felt the same\r\nway--till I saw her last winter in Rome."\r\n\r\nThe other turned eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Sure enough, you have seen her! Tell me about her."\r\n\r\nA shrewd twinkle came into John Pendleton\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I thought you didn\'t want to know Pollyanna--grown up."\r\n\r\nWith a grimace the young fellow tossed this aside.\r\n\r\n"Is she pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, ye young men!" shrugged John Pendleton, in mock despair. "Always\r\nthe first question--\'Is she pretty?\'!"\r\n\r\n"Well, is she?" insisted the youth.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll let you judge for yourself. If you--On second thoughts, though,\r\nI believe I won\'t. You might be too disappointed. Pollyanna isn\'t\r\npretty, so far as regular features, curls, and dimples go. In fact, to\r\nmy certain knowledge the great cross in Pollyanna\'s life thus far is\r\nthat she is so sure she isn\'t pretty. Long ago she told me that black\r\ncurls were one of the things she was going to have when she got to\r\nHeaven; and last year in Rome she said something else. It wasn\'t much,\r\nperhaps, so far as words went, but I detected the longing beneath. She\r\nsaid she did wish that sometime some one would write a novel with a\r\nheroine who had straight hair and a freckle on her nose; but that she\r\nsupposed she ought to be glad girls in books didn\'t have to have\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"That sounds like the old Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll still find her--Pollyanna," smiled the man, quizzically.\r\n"Besides, _I_ think she\'s pretty. Her eyes are lovely. She is the\r\npicture of health. She carries herself with all the joyous springiness\r\nof youth, and her whole face lights up so wonderfully when she talks\r\nthat you quite forget whether her features are regular or not."\r\n\r\n"Does she still--play the game?"\r\n\r\nJohn Pendleton smiled fondly.\r\n\r\n"I imagine she plays it, but she doesn\'t say much about it now, I\r\nfancy. Anyhow, she didn\'t to me, the two or three times I saw her."\r\n\r\nThere was a short silence; then, a little slowly, young Pendleton\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"I think that was one of the things that was worrying me. That game\r\nhas been so much to so many people. It has meant so much everywhere,\r\nall through the town! I couldn\'t bear to think of her giving it up and\r\nNOT playing it. At the same time I couldn\'t fancy a grown-up Pollyanna\r\nperpetually admonishing people to be glad for something. Someway,\r\nI--well, as I said, I--I just didn\'t want Pollyanna to grow up,\r\nanyhow."\r\n\r\n"Well, I wouldn\'t worry," shrugged the elder man, with a peculiar\r\nsmile. "Always, with Pollyanna, you know, it was the \'clearing-up\r\nshower,\' both literally and figuratively; and I think you\'ll find she\r\nlives up to the same principle now--though perhaps not quite in the\r\nsame way. Poor child, I fear she\'ll need some kind of game to make\r\nexistence endurable, for a while, at least."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean because Mrs. Chilton has lost her money? Are they so very\r\npoor, then?"\r\n\r\n"I suspect they are. In fact, they are in rather bad shape, so far as\r\nmoney matters go, as I happen to know. Mrs. Chilton\'s own fortune has\r\nshrunk unbelievably, and poor Tom\'s estate is very small, and\r\nhopelessly full of bad debts--professional services never paid for,\r\nand that never will be paid for. Tom could never say no when his help\r\nwas needed, and all the dead beats in town knew it and imposed on him\r\naccordingly. Expenses have been heavy with him lately. Besides, he\r\nexpected great things when he should have completed this special work\r\nin Germany. Naturally he supposed his wife and Pollyanna were more\r\nthan amply provided for through the Harrington estate; so he had no\r\nworry in that direction."\r\n\r\n"Hm-m; I see, I see. Too bad, too bad!"\r\n\r\n"But that isn\'t all. It was about two months after Tom\'s death that I\r\nsaw Mrs. Chilton and Pollyanna in Rome, and Mrs. Chilton then was in a\r\nterrible state. In addition to her sorrow, she had just begun to get\r\nan inkling of the trouble with her finances, and she was nearly\r\nfrantic. She refused to come home. She declared she never wanted to\r\nsee Beldingsville, or anybody in it, again. You see, she has always\r\nbeen a peculiarly proud woman, and it was all affecting her in a\r\nrather curious way. Pollyanna said that her aunt seemed possessed with\r\nthe idea that Beldingsville had not approved of her marrying Dr.\r\nChilton in the first place, at her age; and now that he was dead, she\r\nfelt that they were utterly out of sympathy in any grief that she\r\nmight show. She resented keenly, too, the fact that they must now know\r\nthat she was poor as well as widowed. In short, she had worked herself\r\nInto an utterly morbid, wretched state, as unreasonable as it was\r\nterrible. Poor little Pollyanna! It was a marvel to me how she stood\r\nit. All is, if Mrs. Chilton kept it up, and continues to keep it up,\r\nthat child will be a wreck. That\'s why I said Pollyanna would need\r\nsome kind of a game if ever anybody did."\r\n\r\n"The pity of it!--to think of that happening to Pollyanna!" exclaimed\r\nthe young man, in a voice that was not quite steady.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and you can see all is not right by the way they are coming\r\nto-day--so quietly, with not a word to anybody. That was Polly\r\nChilton\'s doings, I\'ll warrant. She didn\'t WANT to be met by anybody.\r\nI understand she wrote to no one but her Old Tom\'s wife, Mrs. Durgin,\r\nwho had the keys."\r\n\r\n"Yes, so Nancy told me--good old soul! She\'d got the whole house open,\r\nand had contrived somehow to make it look as if it wasn\'t a tomb of\r\ndead hopes and lost pleasures. Of course the grounds looked fairly\r\nwell, for Old Tom has kept them up, after a fashion. But it made my\r\nheart ache--the whole thing."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, then, curtly, John Pendleton suggested:\r\n\r\n"They ought to be met."\r\n\r\n"They will be met."\r\n\r\n"Are YOU going to the station?"\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\n"Then you know what train they\'re coming on."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. Neither does Nancy."\r\n\r\n"Then how will you manage?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to begin in the morning and go to every train till they\r\ncome," laughed the young man, a bit grimly. "Timothy\'s going, too,\r\nwith the family carriage. After all, there aren\'t many trains, anyway,\r\nthat they can come on, you know."\r\n\r\n"Hm-m, I know," said John Pendleton. "Jim, I admire your nerve, but\r\nnot your judgment. I\'m glad you\'re going to follow your nerve and not\r\nyour judgment, however--and I wish you good luck."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir," smiled the young man dolefully. "I need \'em--your\r\ngood wishes--all right, all right, as Nancy says."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nWHEN POLLYANNA CAME\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the train neared Beldingsville, Pollyanna watched her aunt\r\nanxiously. All day Mrs. Chilton had been growing more and more\r\nrestless, more and more gloomy; and Pollyanna was fearful of the time\r\nwhen the familiar home station should be reached.\r\n\r\nAs Pollyanna looked at her aunt, her heart ached. She was thinking\r\nthat she would not have believed it possible that any one could have\r\nchanged and aged so greatly in six short months. Mrs. Chilton\'s eyes\r\nwere lusterless, her cheeks pallid and shrunken, and her forehead\r\ncrossed and recrossed by fretful lines. Her mouth drooped at the\r\ncorners, and her hair was combed tightly back in the unbecoming\r\nfashion that had been hers when Pollyanna first had seen her, years\r\nbefore. All the softness and sweetness that seemed to have come to her\r\nwith her marriage had dropped from her like a cloak, leaving uppermost\r\nthe old hardness and sourness that had been hers when she was Miss\r\nPolly Harrington, unloved, and unloving.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna!" Mrs. Chilton\'s voice was incisive.\r\n\r\nPollyanna started guiltily. She had an uncomfortable feeling that her\r\naunt might have read her thoughts.\r\n\r\n"Yes, auntie."\r\n\r\n"Where is that black bag--the little one?"\r\n\r\n"Right here."\r\n\r\n"Well, I wish you\'d get out my black veil. We\'re nearly there."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s so hot and thick, auntie!"\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, I asked for that black veil. If you\'d please learn to do\r\nwhat I ask without arguing about it, it would be a great deal easier\r\nfor me. I want that veil. Do you suppose I\'m going to give all\r\nBeldingsville a chance to see how I \'take it\'?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, auntie, they\'d never be there in THAT spirit," protested\r\nPollyanna, hurriedly rummaging in the black bag for the much-wanted\r\nveil. "Besides, there won\'t be anybody there, anyway, to meet us. We\r\ndidn\'t tell any one we were coming, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. We didn\'t TELL any one to meet us. But we instructed\r\nMrs. Durgin to have the rooms aired and the key under the mat for\r\nto-day. Do you suppose Mary Durgin has kept that information to\r\nherself? Not much! Half the town knows we\'re coming to-day, and a\r\ndozen or more will \'happen around\' the station about train time. I\r\nknow them! They want to see what Polly Harrington POOR looks like.\r\nThey--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, auntie, auntie," begged Pollyanna, with tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n"If I wasn\'t so alone. If--the doctor were only here, and--" She\r\nstopped speaking and turned away her head. Her mouth worked\r\nconvulsively. "Where is--that veil?" she choked huskily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear. Here it is--right here," comforted Pollyanna, whose only\r\naim now, plainly, was to get the veil into her aunt\'s hands with all\r\nhaste. "And here we are now almost there. Oh, auntie, I do wish you\'d\r\nhad Old Tom or Timothy meet us!"\r\n\r\n"And ride home in state, as if we could AFFORD to keep such horses and\r\ncarriages? And when we know we shall have to sell them to-morrow? No,\r\nI thank you, Pollyanna. I prefer to use the public carriage, under\r\nthose circumstances."\r\n\r\n"I know, but--" The train came to a jolting, jarring stop, and only a\r\nfluttering sigh finished Pollyanna\'s sentence.\r\n\r\nAs the two women stepped to the platform, Mrs. Chilton, in her black\r\nveil, looked neither to the right nor the left. Pollyanna, however,\r\nwas nodding and smiling tearfully in half a dozen directions before\r\nshe had taken twice as many steps. Then, suddenly, she found herself\r\nlooking into a familiar, yet strangely unfamiliar face.\r\n\r\n"Why, it isn\'t--it IS--Jimmy!" she beamed, reaching forth a cordial\r\nhand. "That is, I suppose I should say \'MR. PENDLETON,\'" she corrected\r\nherself with a shy smile that said plainly: "Now that you\'ve grown so\r\ntall and fine!"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see you try it," challenged the youth, with a very\r\nJimmy-like tilt to his chin. He turned then to speak to Mrs. Chilton;\r\nbut that lady, with her head half averted, was hurrying on a little in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nHe turned back to Pollyanna, his eyes troubled and sympathetic.\r\n\r\n"If you\'d please come this way--both of you," he urged hurriedly.\r\n"Timothy is here with the carriage."\r\n\r\n"Oh, how good of him," cried Pollyanna, but with an anxious glance at\r\nthe somber veiled figure ahead. Timidly she touched her aunt\'s arm.\r\n"Auntie, dear, Timothy\'s here. He\'s come with the carriage. He\'s over\r\nthis side. And--this is Jimmy Bean, auntie. You remember Jimmy Bean!"\r\n\r\nIn her nervousness and embarrassment Pollyanna did not notice that she\r\nhad given the young man the old name of his boyhood. Mrs. Chilton,\r\nhowever, evidently did notice it. With palpable reluctance she turned\r\nand inclined her head ever so slightly.\r\n\r\n"Mr.--Pendleton is very kind, I am sure; but--I am sorry that he or\r\nTimothy took quite so much trouble," she said frigidly.\r\n\r\n"No trouble--no trouble at all, I assure you," laughed the young man,\r\ntrying to hide his embarrassment. "Now if you\'ll just let me have your\r\nchecks, so I can see to your baggage."\r\n\r\n"Thank you," began Mrs. Chilton, "but I am very sure we can--"\r\n\r\nBut Pollyanna, with a relieved little "thank you!" had already passed\r\nover the checks; and dignity demanded that Mrs. Chilton say no more.\r\n\r\nThe drive home was a silent one. Timothy, vaguely hurt at the\r\nreception he had met with at the hands of his former mistress, sat up\r\nin front stiff and straight, with tense lips. Mrs. Chilton, after a\r\nweary "Well, well, child, just as you please; I suppose we shall have\r\nto ride home in it now!" had subsided into stern gloom. Pollyanna,\r\nhowever, was neither stern, nor tense, nor gloomy. With eager, though\r\ntearful eyes she greeted each loved landmark as they came to it. Only\r\nonce did she speak, and that was to say:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t Jimmy fine? How he has improved! And hasn\'t he the nicest eyes\r\nand smile?"\r\n\r\nShe waited hopefully, but as there was no reply to this, she contented\r\nherself with a cheerful: "Well, I think he has, anyhow."\r\n\r\nTimothy had been both too aggrieved and too afraid to tell Mrs.\r\nChilton what to expect at home; so the wide-flung doors and\r\nflower-adorned rooms with Nancy courtesying on the porch were a\r\ncomplete surprise to Mrs. Chilton and Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Why, Nancy, how perfectly lovely!" cried Pollyanna, springing lightly\r\nto the ground. "Auntie, here\'s Nancy to welcome us. And only see how\r\ncharming she\'s made everything look!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna\'s voice was determinedly cheerful, though it shook audibly.\r\nThis home-coming without the dear doctor whom she had loved so well\r\nwas not easy for her; and if hard for her, she knew something of what\r\nit must be for her aunt. She knew, too, that the one thing her aunt\r\nwas dreading was a breakdown before Nancy, than which nothing could be\r\nworse in her eyes. Behind the heavy black veil the eyes were brimming\r\nand the lips were trembling, Pollyanna knew. She knew, too, that to\r\nhide these facts her aunt would probably seize the first opportunity\r\nfor faultfinding, and make her anger a cloak to hide the fact that her\r\nheart was breaking. Pollyanna was not surprised, therefore, to hear\r\nher aunt\'s few cold words of greeting to Nancy followed by a sharp:\r\n"Of course all this was very kind, Nancy; but, really, I would have\r\nmuch preferred that you had not done it."\r\n\r\nAll the joy fled from, Nancy\'s face. She looked hurt and frightened.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Miss Polly--I mean, Mis\' Chilton," she entreated; "it seemed\r\nas if I couldn\'t let you--"\r\n\r\n"There, there, never mind, Nancy," interrupted Mrs. Chilton. "I--I\r\ndon\'t want to talk about it." And, with her head proudly high, she\r\nswept out of the room. A minute later they heard the door of her\r\nbedroom shut up-stairs.\r\n\r\nNancy turned in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Miss Pollyanna, what is it? What have I done? I thought she\'d\r\nLIKE it. I meant it all right!"\r\n\r\n"Of course you did," wept Pollyanna, fumbling in her bag for her\r\nhandkerchief. "And \'twas lovely to have you do it, too,--just lovely."\r\n\r\n"But SHE didn\'t like it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did. But she didn\'t want to show she liked it. She was\r\nafraid if she did she\'d show--other things, and--Oh, Nancy, Nancy, I\'m\r\nso glad just to c-cry!" And Pollyanna was sobbing on Nancy\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"There, there, dear; so she shall, so she shall," soothed Nancy,\r\npatting the heaving shoulders with one hand, and trying, with the\r\nother, to make the corner of her apron serve as a handkerchief to wipe\r\nher own tears away.\r\n\r\n"You see, I mustn\'t--cry--before--HER," faltered Pollyanna; "and it\r\nWAS hard--coming here--the first time, you know, and all. And I KNEW\r\nhow she was feeling."\r\n\r\n"Of course, of course, poor lamb," crooned Nancy. "And to think the\r\nfirst thing _I_ should have done was somethin\' ter vex her, and--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but she wasn\'t vexed at that," corrected Pollyanna, agitatedly.\r\n"It\'s just her way, Nancy. You see, she doesn\'t like to show how badly\r\nshe feels about--about the doctor. And she\'s so afraid she WILL show\r\nit that she--she just takes anything for an excuse to--to talk about.\r\nShe does it to me, too, just the same. So I know all about it. See?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I see, I do, I do." Nancy\'s lips snapped together a little\r\nseverely, and her sympathetic pats, for the minute, were even more\r\nloving, if possible. "Poor lamb! I\'m glad I come, anyhow, for your\r\nsake."\r\n\r\n"Yes, so am I," breathed Pollyanna, gently drawing herself away and\r\nwiping her eyes. "There, I feel better. And I do thank you ever so\r\nmuch, Nancy, and I appreciate it. Now don\'t let us keep you when it\'s\r\ntime for you to go."\r\n\r\n"Ho! I\'m thinkin\' I\'ll stay for a spell," sniffed Nancy.\r\n\r\n"Stay! Why, Nancy, I thought you were married. Aren\'t you Timothy\'s\r\nwife?"\r\n\r\n"Sure! But he won\'t mind--for you. He\'d WANT me to stay--for you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but, Nancy, we couldn\'t let you," demurred Pollyanna. "We can\'t\r\nhave anybody--now, you know. I\'m going to do the work. Until we know\r\njust how things are, we shall live very economically, Aunt Polly\r\nsays."\r\n\r\n"Ho! as if I\'d take money from--" began Nancy, in bridling wrath; but\r\nat the expression on the other\'s face she stopped, and let her words\r\ndwindle off in a mumbling protest, as she hurried from the room to\r\nlook after her creamed chicken on the stove.\r\n\r\nNot until supper was over, and everything put in order, did Mrs.\r\nTimothy Durgin consent to drive away with her husband; then she went\r\nwith evident reluctance, and with many pleadings to be allowed to come\r\n"just ter help out a bit" at any time.\r\n\r\nAfter Nancy had gone, Pollyanna came into the living-room where Mrs.\r\nChilton was sitting alone, her hand over her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, dearie, shall I light up?" suggested Pollyanna, brightly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I suppose so."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t Nancy a dear to fix us all up so nice?"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n"Where in the world she found all these flowers I can\'t imagine. She\r\nhas them in every room down here, and in both bedrooms, too."\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a half-stifled sigh and threw a wistful glance into her\r\naunt\'s averted face. After a moment she began again hopefully.\r\n\r\n"I saw Old Tom in the garden. Poor man, his rheumatism is worse than\r\never. He was bent nearly double. He inquired very particularly for\r\nyou, and--"\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton turned with a sharp interruption.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, what are we going to do?"\r\n\r\n"Do? Why, the best we can, of course, dearie."\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton gave an impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Pollyanna, do be serious for once. You\'ll find it is\r\nserious, fast enough. WHAT are we going to DO? As you know, my income\r\nhas almost entirely stopped. Of course, some of the things are worth\r\nsomething, I suppose; but Mr. Hart says very few of them will pay\r\nanything at present. We have something in the bank, and a little\r\ncoming in, of course. And we have this house. But of what earthly use\r\nis the house? We can\'t eat it, or wear it. It\'s too big for us, the\r\nway we shall have to live; and we couldn\'t sell it for half what it\'s\r\nreally worth, unless we HAPPENED to find just the person that wanted\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Sell it! Oh, auntie, you wouldn\'t--this beautiful house full of\r\nlovely things!"\r\n\r\n"I may have to, Pollyanna. We have to eat--unfortunately."\r\n\r\n"I know it; and I\'m always SO hungry," mourned Pollyanna, with a\r\nrueful laugh. "Still, I suppose I ought to be glad my appetite is so\r\ngood."\r\n\r\n"Very likely. You\'d find something to be glad about, of course. But\r\nwhat shall we do, child? I do wish you\'d be serious for a minute."\r\n\r\nA quick change came to Pollyanna\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I am serious, Aunt Polly. I\'ve been thinking. I--I wish I could earn\r\nsome money."\r\n\r\n"Oh, child, child, to think of my ever living to hear you say that!"\r\nmoaned the woman; "--a daughter of the Harringtons having to earn her\r\nbread!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, but that isn\'t the way to look at it," laughed Pollyanna. "You\r\nought to be glad if a daughter of the Harringtons is SMART enough to\r\nearn her bread! That isn\'t any disgrace, Aunt Polly."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not; but it isn\'t very pleasant to one\'s pride, after the\r\nposition we\'ve always occupied in Beldingsville, Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nPollyanna did not seem to have heard. Her eyes were musingly fixed on\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n"If only I had some talent! If only I could do something better than\r\nanybody else in the world," she sighed at last. "I can sing a little,\r\nplay a little, embroider a little, and darn a little; but I can\'t do\r\nany of them well--not well enough to be paid for it.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'d like best to cook," she resumed, after a minute\'s\r\nsilence, "and keep house. You know I loved that in Germany winters,\r\nwhen Gretchen used to bother us so much by not coming when we wanted\r\nher. But I don\'t exactly want to go into other people\'s kitchens to do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"As if I\'d let you! Pollyanna!" shuddered Mrs. Chilton again.\r\n\r\n"And of course, to just work in our own kitchen here doesn\'t bring in\r\nanything," bemoaned Pollyanna, "--not any money, I mean. And it\'s\r\nmoney we need."\r\n\r\n"It most emphatically is," sighed Aunt Polly.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, broken at last by Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"To think that after all you\'ve done for me, auntie--to think that\r\nnow, if I only could, I\'d have such a splendid chance to help! And\r\nyet--I can\'t do it. Oh, why wasn\'t I born with something that\'s worth\r\nmoney?"\r\n\r\n"There, there, child, don\'t, don\'t! Of course, if the doctor--" The\r\nwords choked into silence.\r\n\r\nPollyanna looked up quickly, and sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, this will never do!" she exclaimed, with a complete\r\nchange of manner. "Don\'t you fret, auntie. What\'ll you wager that I\r\ndon\'t develop the most marvelous talent going, one of these days?\r\nBesides, _I_ think it\'s real exciting--all this. There\'s so much\r\nuncertainty in it. There\'s a lot of fun in wanting things--and then\r\nwatching for them to come. Just living along and KNOWING you\'re going\r\nto have everything you want is so--so humdrum, you know," she\r\nfinished, with a gay little laugh.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton, however, did not laugh. She only sighed and said:\r\n\r\n"Dear me, Pollyanna, what a child you are!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA MATTER OF ADJUSTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first few days at Beldingsville were not easy either for Mrs.\r\nChilton or for Pollyanna. They were days of adjustment; and days of\r\nadjustment are seldom easy.\r\n\r\nFrom travel and excitement it was not easy to put one\'s mind to the\r\nconsideration of the price of butter and the delinquencies of the\r\nbutcher. From having all one\'s time for one\'s own, it was not easy to\r\nfind always the next task clamoring to be done. Friends and neighbors\r\ncalled, too, and although Pollyanna welcomed them with glad\r\ncordiality, Mrs. Chilton, when possible, excused herself; and always\r\nshe said bitterly to Pollyanna:\r\n\r\n"Curiosity, I suppose, to see how Polly Harrington likes being poor."\r\n\r\nOf the doctor Mrs. Chilton seldom spoke, yet Pollyanna knew very well\r\nthat almost never was he absent from her thoughts; and that more than\r\nhalf her taciturnity was but her usual cloak for a deeper emotion\r\nwhich she did not care to show.\r\n\r\nJimmy Pendleton Pollyanna saw several times during that first month.\r\nHe came first with John Pendleton for a somewhat stiff and ceremonious\r\ncall--not that it was either stiff or ceremonious until after Aunt\r\nPolly came into the room; then it was both. For some reason Aunt Polly\r\nhad not excused herself on this occasion. After that Jimmy had come by\r\nhimself, once with flowers, once with a book for Aunt Polly, twice\r\nwith no excuse at all. Pollyanna welcomed him with frank pleasure\r\nalways. Aunt Polly, after that first time, did not see him at all.\r\n\r\nTo the most of their friends and acquaintances Pollyanna said little\r\nabout the change in their circumstances. To Jimmy, however, she talked\r\nfreely, and always her constant cry was: "If only I could do something\r\nto bring in some money!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting to be the most mercenary little creature you ever saw,"\r\nshe laughed dolefully. "I\'ve got so I measure everything with a dollar\r\nbill, and I actually think in quarters and dimes. You see, Aunt Polly\r\ndoes feel so poor!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a shame!" stormed Jimmy.\r\n\r\n"I know it. But, honestly, I think she feels a little poorer than she\r\nneeds to--she\'s brooded over it so. But I do wish I could help!"\r\n\r\nJimmy looked down at the wistful, eager face with its luminous eyes,\r\nand his own eyes softened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: See Frontispiece: "Jimmy looked down at the wistful,\r\neager face"]\r\n\r\n"What do you WANT to do--if you could do it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I want to cook and keep house," smiled Pollyanna, with a pensive\r\nsigh. "I just love to beat eggs and sugar, and hear the soda gurgle\r\nits little tune in the cup of sour milk. I\'m happy if I\'ve got a day\'s\r\nbaking before me. But there isn\'t any money in that--except in\r\nsomebody else\'s kitchen, of course. And I--I don\'t exactly love it\r\nwell enough for that!"\r\n\r\n"I should say not!" ejaculated the young fellow.\r\n\r\nOnce more he glanced down at the expressive face so near him. This\r\ntime a queer look came to the corners of his mouth. He pursed his\r\nlips, then spoke, a slow red mounting to his forehead.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course you might--marry. Have you thought of that--Miss\r\nPollyanna?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a merry laugh. Voice and manner were unmistakably those\r\nof a girl quite untouched by even the most far-reaching of Cupid\'s\r\ndarts.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, I shall never marry," she said blithely. "In the first place\r\nI\'m not pretty, you know; and in the second place, I\'m going to live\r\nwith Aunt Polly and take care of her."\r\n\r\n"Not pretty, eh?" smiled Pendleton, quizzically. "Did it\r\never--er--occur to you that there might be a difference of opinion on\r\nthat, Pollyanna?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna shook her head.\r\n\r\n"There couldn\'t be. I\'ve got a mirror, you see," she objected, with a\r\nmerry glance.\r\n\r\nIt sounded like coquetry. In any other girl it would have been\r\ncoquetry, Pendleton decided. But, looking into the face before him\r\nnow, Pendleton knew that it was not coquetry. He knew, too, suddenly,\r\nwhy Pollyanna had seemed so different from any girl he had ever known.\r\nSomething of her old literal way of looking at things still clung to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Why aren\'t you pretty?" he asked.\r\n\r\nEven as he uttered the question, and sure as he was of his estimate of\r\nPollyanna\'s character, Pendleton quite held his breath at his\r\ntemerity. He could not help thinking of how quickly any other girl he\r\nknew would have resented that implied acceptance of her claim to no\r\nbeauty. But Pollyanna\'s first words showed him that even this lurking\r\nfear of his was quite groundless.\r\n\r\n"Why, I just am not," she laughed, a little ruefully. "I wasn\'t made\r\nthat way. Maybe you don\'t remember, but long ago, when I was a little\r\ngirl, it always seemed to me that one of the nicest things Heaven was\r\ngoing to give me when I got there was black curls."\r\n\r\n"And is that your chief desire now?"\r\n\r\n"N-no, maybe not," hesitated Pollyanna. "But I still think I\'d like\r\nthem. Besides, my eyelashes aren\'t long enough, and my nose isn\'t\r\nGrecian, or Roman, or any of those delightfully desirable ones that\r\nbelong to a \'type.\' It\'s just NOSE. And my face is too long, or too\r\nshort, I\'ve forgotten which; but I measured it once with one of those\r\n\'correct-for-beauty\' tests, and it wasn\'t right, anyhow. And they said\r\nthe width of the face should be equal to five eyes, and the width of\r\nthe eyes equal to--to something else. I\'ve forgotten that, too--only\r\nthat mine wasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"What a lugubrious picture!" laughed Pendleton. Then, with his gaze\r\nadmiringly regarding the girl\'s animated face and expressive eyes, he\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n"Did you ever look in the mirror when you were talking, Pollyanna?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no, of course not!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'d better try it sometime."\r\n\r\n"What a funny idea! Imagine my doing it," laughed the girl. "What\r\nshall I say? Like this? \'Now, you, Pollyanna, what if your eyelashes\r\naren\'t long, and your nose is just a nose, be glad you\'ve got SOME\r\neyelashes and SOME nose!\'"\r\n\r\nPendleton joined in her laugh, but an odd expression came to his face.\r\n\r\n"Then you still play--the game," he said, a little diffidently.\r\n\r\nPollyanna turned soft eyes of wonder full upon him.\r\n\r\n"Why, of course! Why, Jimmy, I don\'t believe I could have lived--the\r\nlast six months--if it hadn\'t been for that blessed game." Her voice\r\nshook a little.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t heard you say much about it," he commented.\r\n\r\nShe changed color.\r\n\r\n"I know. I think I\'m afraid--of saying too much--to outsiders, who\r\ndon\'t care, you know. It wouldn\'t sound quite the same from me now, at\r\ntwenty, as it did when I was ten. I realize that, of course. Folks\r\ndon\'t like to be preached at, you know," she finished with a whimsical\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"I know," nodded the young fellow gravely. "But I wonder sometimes,\r\nPollyanna, if you really understand yourself what that game is, and\r\nwhat it has done for those who are playing it."\r\n\r\n"I know--what it has done for myself." Her voice was low, and her eyes\r\nwere turned away.\r\n\r\n"You see, it really WORKS, if you play it," he mused aloud, after a\r\nshort silence. "Somebody said once that it would revolutionize the\r\nworld if everybody would really play it. And I believe it would."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but some folks don\'t want to be revolutionized," smiled\r\nPollyanna. "I ran across a man in Germany last year. He had lost his\r\nmoney, and was in hard luck generally. Dear, dear, but he was gloomy!\r\nSomebody in my presence tried to cheer him up one day by saying,\r\n\'Come, come, things might be worse, you know!\' Dear, dear, but you\r\nshould have heard that man then!\r\n\r\n"\'If there is anything on earth that makes me mad clear through,\' he\r\nsnarled, \'it is to be told that things might be worse, and to be\r\nthankful for what I\'ve got left. These people who go around with an\r\neverlasting grin on their faces caroling forth that they are thankful\r\nthat they can breathe, or eat, or walk, or lie down, I have no use\r\nfor. I don\'t WANT to breathe, or eat, or walk, or lie down--if things\r\nare as they are now with me. And when I\'m told that I ought to be\r\nthankful for some such tommyrot as that, it makes me just want to go\r\nout and shoot somebody!\'"\r\n\r\n"Imagine what I\'D have gotten if I\'d have introduced the glad game to\r\nthat man!" laughed Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care. He needed it," answered Jimmy.\r\n\r\n"Of course he did--but he wouldn\'t have thanked me for giving it to\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. But, listen! As he was, under his present philosophy\r\nand scheme of living, he made himself and everybody else wretched,\r\ndidn\'t he? Well, just suppose he was playing the game. While he was\r\ntrying to hunt up something to be glad about in everything that had\r\nhappened to him, he COULDN\'T be at the same time grumbling and\r\ngrowling about how bad things were; so that much would be gained. He\'d\r\nbe a whole lot easier to live with, both for himself and for his\r\nfriends. Meanwhile, just thinking of the doughnut instead of the hole\r\ncouldn\'t make things any worse for him, and it might make things\r\nbetter; for it wouldn\'t give him such a gone feeling in the pit of his\r\nstomach, and his digestion would be better. I tell you, troubles are\r\npoor things to hug. They\'ve got too many prickers."\r\n\r\nPollyanna smiled appreciatively.\r\n\r\n"That makes me think of what I told a poor old lady once. She was one\r\nof my Ladies\' Aiders out West, and was one of the kind of people that\r\nreally ENJOYS being miserable and telling over her causes for\r\nunhappiness. I was perhaps ten years old, and was trying to teach her\r\nthe game. I reckon I wasn\'t having very good success, and evidently I\r\nat last dimly realized the reason, for I said to her triumphantly:\r\n\'Well, anyhow, you can be glad you\'ve got such a lot of things to make\r\nyou miserable, for you love to be miserable so well!\'"\r\n\r\n"Well, if that wasn\'t a good one on her," chuckled Jimmy.\r\n\r\nPollyanna raised her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid she didn\'t enjoy it any more than the man in Germany would\r\nhave if I\'d told him the same thing."\r\n\r\n"But they ought to be told, and you ought to tell--" Pendleton stopped\r\nshort with so queer an expression on his face that Pollyanna looked at\r\nhim in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Why, Jimmy, what is it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing. I was only thinking," he answered, puckering his lips.\r\n"Here I am urging you to do the very thing I was afraid you WOULD do\r\nbefore I saw you, you know. That is, I was afraid before I saw you,\r\nthat--that--" He floundered into a helpless pause, looking very red\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n"Well, Jimmy Pendleton," bridled the girl, "you needn\'t think you can\r\nstop there, sir. Now just what do you mean by all that, please?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, er--n-nothing, much."\r\n\r\n"I\'m waiting," murmured Pollyanna. Voice and manner were calm and\r\nconfident, though the eyes twinkled mischievously.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow hesitated, glanced at her smiling face, and\r\ncapitulated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, have it your own way," he shrugged. "It\'s only that I was\r\nworrying--a little--about that game, for fear you WOULD talk it just\r\nas you used to, you know, and--" But a merry peal of laughter\r\ninterrupted him.\r\n\r\n"There, what did I tell you? Even you were worried, it seems, lest I\r\nshould be at twenty just what I was at ten!"\r\n\r\n"N-no, I didn\'t mean--Pollyanna, honestly, I thought--of course I\r\nknew--" But Pollyanna only put her hands to her ears and went off into\r\nanother peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTWO LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was toward the latter part of June that the letter came to\r\nPollyanna from Della Wetherby.\r\n\r\n"I am writing to ask you a favor," Miss Wetherby wrote. "I am hoping\r\nyou can tell me of some quiet private family in Beldingsville that\r\nwill be willing to take my sister to board for the summer. There would\r\nbe three of them, Mrs. Carew, her secretary, and her adopted son,\r\nJamie. (You remember Jamie, don\'t you?) They do not like to go to an\r\nordinary hotel or boarding house. My sister is very tired, and the\r\ndoctor has advised her to go into the country for a complete rest and\r\nchange. He suggested Vermont or New Hampshire. We immediately thought\r\nof Beldingsville and you; and we wondered if you couldn\'t recommend\r\njust the right place to us. I told Ruth I would write you. They would\r\nlike to go right away, early in July, if possible. Would it be asking\r\ntoo much to request you to let us know as soon as you conveniently can\r\nif you do know of a place? Please address me here. My sister is with\r\nus here at the Sanatorium for a few weeks\' treatment.\r\n\r\n"Hoping for a favorable reply, I am,\r\n\r\n                                    "Most cordially yours,\r\n\r\n                                    "DELLA WETHERBY."\r\n\r\nFor the first few minutes after the letter was finished, Pollyanna sat\r\nwith frowning brow, mentally searching the homes of Beldingsville for\r\na possible boarding house for her old friends. Then a sudden something\r\ngave her thoughts a new turn, and with a joyous exclamation she\r\nhurried to her aunt in the living-room.\r\n\r\n"Auntie, auntie," she panted; "I\'ve got just the loveliest idea. I\r\ntold you something would happen, and that I\'d develop that wonderful\r\ntalent sometime. Well, I have. I have right now. Listen! I\'ve had a\r\nletter from Miss Wetherby, Mrs. Carew\'s sister--where I stayed that\r\nwinter in Boston, you know--and they want to come into the country to\r\nboard for the summer, and Miss Wetherby\'s written to see if I didn\'t\r\nknow a place for them. They don\'t want a hotel or an ordinary boarding\r\nhouse, you see. And at first I didn\'t know of one; but now I do. I do,\r\nAunt Polly! Just guess where \'tis."\r\n\r\n"Dear me, child," ejaculated Mrs. Chilton, "how you do run on! I\r\nshould think you were a dozen years old instead of a woman grown. Now\r\nwhat are you talking about?"\r\n\r\n"About a boarding place for Mrs. Carew and Jamie. I\'ve found it,"\r\nbabbled Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Indeed! Well, what of it? Of what possible interest can that be to\r\nme, child?" murmured Mrs. Chilton, drearily.\r\n\r\n"Because it\'s HERE. I\'m going to have them here, auntie."\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna!" Mrs. Chilton was sitting erect in horror.\r\n\r\n"Now, auntie, please don\'t say no--please don\'t," begged Pollyanna,\r\neagerly. "Don\'t you see? This is my chance, the chance I\'ve been\r\nwaiting for; and it\'s just dropped right into my hands. We can do it\r\nlovely. We have plenty of room, and you know I CAN cook and keep\r\nhouse. And now there\'d be money in it, for they\'d pay well, I know;\r\nand they\'d love to come, I\'m sure. There\'d be three of them--there\'s a\r\nsecretary with them."\r\n\r\n"But, Pollyanna, I can\'t! Turn this house into a boarding house?--the\r\nHarrington homestead a common boarding house? Oh, Pollyanna, I can\'t,\r\nI can\'t!"\r\n\r\n"But it wouldn\'t be a common boarding house, dear. \'Twill be an\r\nuncommon one. Besides, they\'re our friends. It would be like having\r\nour friends come to see us; only they\'d be PAYING guests, so meanwhile\r\nwe\'d be earning money--money that we NEED, auntie, money that we\r\nneed," she emphasized significantly.\r\n\r\nA spasm of hurt pride crossed Polly Chilton\'s face. With a low moan\r\nshe fell back in her chair.\r\n\r\n"But how could you do it?" she asked at last, faintly. "You couldn\'t\r\ndo the work part alone, child!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, of course not," chirped Pollyanna. (Pollyanna was on sure\r\nground now. She knew her point was won.) "But I could do the cooking\r\nand the overseeing, and I\'m sure I could get one of Nancy\'s younger\r\nsisters to help about the rest. Mrs. Durgin would do the laundry part\r\njust as she does now."\r\n\r\n"But, Pollyanna, I\'m not well at all--you know I\'m not. I couldn\'t do\r\nmuch."\r\n\r\n"Of course not. There\'s no reason why you should," scorned Pollyanna,\r\nloftily. "Oh, auntie, won\'t it be splendid? Why, it seems too good to\r\nbe true--money just dropped into my hands like that!"\r\n\r\n"Dropped into your hands, indeed! You still have some things to learn\r\nin this world, Pollyanna, and one is that summer boarders don\'t drop\r\nmoney into anybody\'s hands without looking very sharply to it that\r\nthey get ample return. By the time you fetch and carry and bake and\r\nbrew until you are ready to sink, and by the time you nearly kill\r\nyourself trying to serve everything to order from fresh-laid eggs to\r\nthe weather, you will believe what I tell you."\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'ll remember," laughed Pollyanna. "But I\'m not doing any\r\nworrying now; and I\'m going to hurry and write Miss Wetherby at once\r\nso I can give it to Jimmy Bean to mail when he comes out this\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton stirred restlessly.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, I do wish you\'d call that young man by his proper name.\r\nThat \'Bean\' gives me the shivers. His name is \'Pendleton\' now, as I\r\nunderstand it."\r\n\r\n"So it is," agreed Pollyanna, "but I do forget it half the time. I\r\neven call him that to his face, sometimes, and of course that\'s\r\ndreadful, when he really is adopted, and all. But you see I\'m so\r\nexcited," she finished, as she danced from the room.\r\n\r\nShe had the letter all ready for Jimmy when he called at four o\'clock.\r\nShe was still quivering--with excitement, and she lost no time in\r\ntelling her visitor what it was all about.\r\n\r\n"And I\'m crazy to see them, besides," she cried, when she had told him\r\nof her plans. "I\'ve never seen either of them since that winter. You\r\nknow I told you--didn\'t I tell you?--about Jamie."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, you told me." There was a touch of constraint in the young\r\nman\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"Well, isn\'t it splendid, if they can come?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I don\'t know as I should call it exactly splendid," he parried.\r\n\r\n"Not splendid that I\'ve got such a chance to help Aunt Polly out, for\r\neven this little while? Why, Jimmy, of course it\'s splendid."\r\n\r\n"Well, it strikes me that it\'s going to be rather HARD--for you,"\r\nbridled Jimmy, with more than a shade of irritation.\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course, in some ways. But I shall be so glad for the money\r\ncoming in that I\'ll think of that all the time. You see," she sighed,\r\n"how mercenary I am, Jimmy."\r\n\r\nFor a long minute there was no reply; then, a little abruptly, the\r\nyoung man asked:\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see, how old is this Jamie now?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna glanced up with a merry smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I remember--you never did like his name, \'Jamie,\'" she twinkled.\r\n"Never mind; he\'s adopted now, legally, I believe, and has taken the\r\nname of Carew. So you can call him that."\r\n\r\n"But that isn\'t telling me how old he is," reminded Jimmy, stiffly.\r\n\r\n"Nobody knows, exactly, I suppose. You know he couldn\'t tell; but I\r\nimagine he\'s about your age. I wonder how he is now. I\'ve asked all\r\nabout it in this letter, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you have!" Pendleton looked down at the letter in his hand and\r\nflipped it a little spitefully. He was thinking that he would like to\r\ndrop it, to tear it up, to give it to somebody, to throw it away, to\r\ndo anything with it--but mail it.\r\n\r\nJimmy knew perfectly well that he was jealous, that he always had been\r\njealous of this youth with the name so like and yet so unlike his own.\r\nNot that he was in love with Pollyanna, he assured himself wrathfully.\r\nHe was not that, of course. It was just that he did not care to have\r\nthis strange youth with the sissy name come to Beldingsville and be\r\nalways around to spoil all their good times. He almost said as much to\r\nPollyanna, but something stayed the words on his lips; and after a\r\ntime he took his leave, carrying the letter with him.\r\n\r\nThat Jimmy did not drop the letter, tear it up, give it to anybody, or\r\nthrow it away was evidenced a few days later, for Pollyanna received a\r\nprompt and delighted reply from Miss Wetherby; and when Jimmy came\r\nnext time he heard it read--or rather he heard part of it, for\r\nPollyanna prefaced the reading by saying:\r\n\r\n"Of course the first part is just where she says how glad they are to\r\ncome, and all that. I won\'t read that. But the rest I thought you\'d\r\nlike to hear, because you\'ve heard me talk so much about them.\r\nBesides, you\'ll know them yourself pretty soon, of course. I\'m\r\ndepending a whole lot on you, Jimmy, to help me make it pleasant for\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"Oh, are you!"\r\n\r\n"Now don\'t be sarcastic, just because you don\'t like Jamie\'s name,"\r\nreproved Pollyanna, with mock severity. "You\'ll like HIM, I\'m sure,\r\nwhen you know him; and you\'ll LOVE Mrs. Carew."\r\n\r\n"Will I, indeed?" retorted Jimmy huffily. "Well, that IS a serious\r\nprospect. Let us hope, if I do, the lady will be so gracious as to\r\nreciprocate."\r\n\r\n"Of course," dimpled Pollyanna. "Now listen, and I\'ll read to you\r\nabout her. This letter is from her sister, Della--Miss Wetherby, you\r\nknow, at the Sanatorium."\r\n\r\n"All right. Go ahead!" directed Jimmy, with a somewhat too evident\r\nattempt at polite interest. And Pollyanna, still smiling\r\nmischievously, began to read.\r\n\r\n"You ask me to tell you everything about everybody. That is a large\r\ncommission, but I\'ll do the best I can. To begin with, I think you\'ll\r\nfind my sister quite changed. The new interests that have come into\r\nher life during the last six years have done wonders for her. Just now\r\nshe is a bit thin and tired from overwork, but a good rest will soon\r\nremedy that, and you\'ll see how young and blooming and happy she\r\nlooks. Please notice I said HAPPY. That won\'t mean so much to you as\r\nit does to me, of course, for you were too young to realize quite how\r\nunhappy she was when you first knew her that winter in Boston. Life\r\nwas such a dreary, hopeless thing to her then; and now it is so full\r\nof interest and joy.\r\n\r\n"First she has Jamie, and when you see them together you won\'t need to\r\nbe told what he is to her. To be sure, we are no nearer knowing\r\nwhether he is the REAL Jamie, or not, but my sister loves him like an\r\nown son now, and has legally adopted him, as I presume you know.\r\n\r\n"Then she has her girls. Do you remember Sadie Dean, the salesgirl?\r\nWell, from getting interested in her, and trying to help her to a\r\nhappier living, my sister has broadened her efforts little by little,\r\nuntil she has scores of girls now who regard her as their own best and\r\nparticular good angel. She has started a Home for Working Girls along\r\nnew lines. Half a dozen wealthy and influential men and women are\r\nassociated with her, of course, but she is head and shoulders of the\r\nwhole thing, and never hesitates to give HERSELF to each and every one\r\nof the girls. You can imagine what that means in nerve strain. Her\r\nchief support and right-hand man is her secretary, this same Sadie\r\nDean. You\'ll find HER changed, too, yet she is the same old Sadie.\r\n\r\n"As for Jamie--poor Jamie! The great sorrow of his life is that he\r\nknows now he can never walk. For a time we all had hopes. He was here\r\nat the Sanatorium under Dr. Ames for a year, and he improved to such\r\nan extent that he can go now with crutches. But the poor boy will\r\nalways be a cripple--so far as his feet are concerned, but never as\r\nregards anything else. Someway, after you know Jamie, you seldom think\r\nof him as a cripple, his SOUL is so free. I can\'t explain it, but\r\nyou\'ll know what I mean when you see him; and he has retained, to a\r\nmarvelous degree, his old boyish enthusiasm and joy of living. There\r\nis just one thing--and only one, I believe--that would utterly quench\r\nthat bright spirit and cast him into utter despair; and that is to\r\nfind that he is not Jamie Kent, our nephew. So long has he brooded\r\nover this, and so ardently has he wished it, that he has come actually\r\nto believe that he IS the real Jamie; but if he isn\'t, I hope he will\r\nnever find it out."\r\n\r\n"There, that\'s all she says about them," announced Pollyanna, folding\r\nup the closely-written sheets in her hands. "But isn\'t that\r\ninteresting?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is!" There was a ring of genuineness in Jimmy\'s voice now.\r\nJimmy was thinking suddenly of what his own good legs meant to him. He\r\neven, for the moment, was willing that this poor crippled youth should\r\nhave a PART of Pollyanna\'s thoughts and attentions, if he were not so\r\npresuming as to claim too much of them, of course! "By George! it is\r\ntough for the poor chap, and no mistake."\r\n\r\n"Tough! You don\'t know anything about it, Jimmy Bean," choked\r\nPollyanna; "but _I_ do. _I_ couldn\'t walk once. _I_ KNOW!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course, of course," frowned the youth, moving restively in\r\nhis seat. Jimmy, looking into Pollyanna\'s sympathetic face and\r\nbrimming eyes was suddenly not so sure, after all, that he WAS willing\r\nto have this Jamie come to town--if just to THINK of him made\r\nPollyanna look like that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE PAYING GUESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe few intervening days before the expected arrival of "those\r\ndreadful people," as Aunt Polly termed her niece\'s paying guests, were\r\nbusy ones indeed for Pollyanna--but they were happy ones, too, as\r\nPollyanna refused to be weary, or discouraged, or dismayed, no matter\r\nhow puzzling were the daily problems she had to meet.\r\n\r\nSummoning Nancy, and Nancy\'s younger sister, Betty, to her aid,\r\nPollyanna systematically went through the house, room by room, and\r\narranged for the comfort and convenience of her expected boarders.\r\nMrs. Chilton could do but little to assist. In the first place she was\r\nnot well. In the second place her mental attitude toward the whole\r\nidea was not conducive to aid or comfort, for at her side stalked\r\nalways the Harrington pride of name and race, and on her lips was the\r\nconstant moan:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pollyanna, Pollyanna, to think of the Harrington homestead ever\r\ncoming to this!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t, dearie," Pollyanna at last soothed laughingly. "It\'s the\r\nCarews that are COMING TO THE HARRINGTON HOMESTEAD!"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Chilton was not to be so lightly diverted, and responded only\r\nwith a scornful glance and a deeper sigh, so Pollyanna was forced to\r\nleave her to travel alone her road of determined gloom.\r\n\r\nUpon the appointed day, Pollyanna with Timothy (who owned the\r\nHarrington horses now) went to the station to meet the afternoon\r\ntrain. Up to this hour there had been nothing but confidence and\r\njoyous anticipation in Pollyanna\'s heart. But with the whistle of the\r\nengine there came to her a veritable panic of doubt, shyness, and\r\ndismay. She realized suddenly what she, Pollyanna, almost alone and\r\nunaided, was about to do. She remembered Mrs. Carew\'s wealth,\r\nposition, and fastidious tastes. She recollected, too, that this would\r\nbe a new, tall, young-man Jamie, quite unlike the boy she had known.\r\n\r\nFor one awful moment she thought only of getting away--somewhere,\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n"Timothy, I--I feel sick. I\'m not well. I--tell \'em--er--not to come,"\r\nshe faltered, poising as if for flight.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am!" exclaimed the startled Timothy.\r\n\r\nOne glance into Timothy\'s amazed face was enough. Pollyanna laughed\r\nand threw back her shoulders alertly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing. Never mind! I didn\'t mean it, of course, Timothy.\r\nQuick--see! They\'re almost here," she panted. And Pollyanna hurried\r\nforward, quite herself once more.\r\n\r\nShe knew them at once. Even had there been any doubt in her mind, the\r\ncrutches in the hands of the tall, brown-eyed young man would have\r\npiloted her straight to her goal.\r\n\r\nThere were a brief few minutes of eager handclasps and incoherent\r\nexclamations, then, somehow, she found herself in the carriage with\r\nMrs. Carew at her side, and Jamie and Sadie Dean in front. She had a\r\nchance, then, for the first time, really to see her friends, and to\r\nnote the changes the six years had wrought.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Mrs. Carew, her first feeling was one of surprise. She\r\nhad forgotten that Mrs. Carew was so lovely. She had forgotten that\r\nthe eyelashes were so long, that the eyes they shaded were so\r\nbeautiful. She even caught herself thinking enviously of how exactly\r\nthat perfect face must tally, figure by figure, with that dread\r\nbeauty-test-table. But more than anything else she rejoiced in the\r\nabsence of the old fretful lines of gloom and bitterness.\r\n\r\nThen she turned to Jamie. Here again she was surprised, and for much\r\nthe same reason. Jamie, too, had grown handsome. To herself Pollyanna\r\ndeclared that he was really distinguished looking. His dark eyes,\r\nrather pale face, and dark, waving hair she thought most attractive.\r\nThen she caught a glimpse of the crutches at his side, and a spasm of\r\naching sympathy contracted her throat.\r\n\r\nFrom Jamie Pollyanna turned to Sadie Dean.\r\n\r\nSadie, so far as features went, looked much as she had when Pollyanna\r\nfirst saw her in the Public Garden; but Pollyanna did not need a\r\nsecond glance to know that Sadie, so far as hair, dress, temper,\r\nspeech, and disposition were concerned, was a very different Sadie\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThen Jamie spoke.\r\n\r\n"How good you were to let us come," he said to Pollyanna. "Do you know\r\nwhat I thought of when you wrote that we could come?"\r\n\r\n"Why, n-no, of course not," stammered Pollyanna. Pollyanna was still\r\nseeing the crutches at Jamie\'s side, and her throat was still\r\ntightened from that aching sympathy.\r\n\r\n"Well, I thought of the little maid in the Public Garden with her bag\r\nof peanuts for Sir Lancelot and Lady Guinevere, and I knew that you\r\nwere just putting us in their places, for if you had a bag of peanuts,\r\nand we had none, you wouldn\'t be happy till you\'d shared it with us."\r\n\r\n"A bag of peanuts, indeed!" laughed Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course in this case, your bag of peanuts happened to be airy\r\ncountry rooms, and cow\'s milk, and real eggs from a real hen\'s nest,"\r\nreturned Jamie whimsically; "but it amounts to the same thing. And\r\nmaybe I\'d better warn you--you remember how greedy Sir Lancelot\r\nwas;--well--" He paused meaningly.\r\n\r\n"All right, I\'ll take the risk," dimpled Pollyanna, thinking how glad\r\nshe was that Aunt Polly was not present to hear her worst predictions\r\nso nearly fulfilled thus early. "Poor Sir Lancelot! I wonder if\r\nanybody feeds him now, or if he\'s there at all."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he\'s there, he\'s fed," interposed Mrs. Carew, merrily. "This\r\nridiculous boy still goes down there at least once a week with his\r\npockets bulging with peanuts and I don\'t know what all. He can be\r\ntraced any time by the trail of small grains he leaves behind him; and\r\nhalf the time, when I order my cereal for breakfast it isn\'t\r\nforthcoming, because, forsooth, \'Master Jamie has fed it to the\r\npigeons, ma\'am!\'"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but let me tell you," plunged in Jamie, enthusiastically. And\r\nthe next minute Pollyanna found herself listening with all the old\r\nfascination to a story of a couple of squirrels in a sunlit garden.\r\nLater she saw what Della Wetherby had meant in her letter, for when\r\nthe house was reached, it came as a distinct shock to her to see Jamie\r\npick up his crutches and swing himself out of the carriage with their\r\naid. She knew then that already in ten short minutes he had made her\r\nforget that he was lame.\r\n\r\nTo Pollyanna\'s great relief that first dreaded meeting between Aunt\r\nPolly and the Carew party passed off much better than she had feared.\r\nThe newcomers were so frankly delighted with the old house and\r\neverything in it, that it was an utter impossibility for the mistress\r\nand owner of it all to continue her stiff attitude of disapproving\r\nresignation to their presence. Besides, as was plainly evident before\r\nan hour had passed, the personal charm and magnetism of Jamie had\r\npierced even Aunt Polly\'s armor of distrust; and Pollyanna knew that\r\nat least one of her own most dreaded problems was a problem no longer,\r\nfor already Aunt Polly was beginning to play the stately, yet gracious\r\nhostess to these, her guests.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding her relief at Aunt Polly\'s change of attitude,\r\nhowever, Pollyanna did not find that all was smooth sailing, by any\r\nmeans. There was work, and plenty of it, that must be done. Nancy\'s\r\nsister, Betty, was pleasant and willing, but she was not Nancy, as\r\nPollyanna soon found. She needed training, and training took time.\r\nPollyanna worried, too, for fear everything should not be quite right.\r\nTo Pollyanna, those days, a dusty chair was a crime and a fallen cake\r\na tragedy.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, after incessant arguments and pleadings on the\r\npart of Mrs. Carew and Jamie, Pollyanna came to take her tasks more\r\neasily, and to realize that the real crime and tragedy in her friends\'\r\neyes was, not the dusty chair nor the fallen cake, but the frown of\r\nworry and anxiety on her own face.\r\n\r\n"Just as if it wasn\'t enough for you to LET us come," Jamie declared,\r\n"without just killing yourself with work to get us something to eat."\r\n\r\n"Besides, we ought not to eat so much, anyway," Mrs. Carew laughed,\r\n"or else we shall get \'digestion,\' as one of my girls calls it when\r\nher food disagrees with her."\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful, after all, how easily the three new members of the\r\nfamily fitted into the daily life. Before twenty-four hours had\r\npassed, Mrs. Carew had gotten Mrs. Chilton to asking really interested\r\nquestions about the new Home for Working Girls, and Sadie Dean and\r\nJamie were quarreling over the chance to help with the pea-shelling or\r\nthe flower-picking.\r\n\r\nThe Carews had been at the Harrington homestead nearly a week when one\r\nevening John Pendleton and Jimmy called. Pollyanna had been hoping\r\nthey would come soon. She had, indeed, urged it very strongly before\r\nthe Carews came. She made the introductions now with visible pride.\r\n\r\n"You are such good friends of mine, I want you to know each other, and\r\nbe good friends together," she explained.\r\n\r\nThat Jimmy and Mr. Pendleton should be clearly impressed with the\r\ncharm and beauty of Mrs. Carew did not surprise Pollyanna in the\r\nleast; but the look that came into Mrs. Carew\'s face at sight of Jimmy\r\ndid surprise her very much. It was almost a look of recognition.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mr. Pendleton, haven\'t I met you before?" Mrs. Carew cried.\r\n\r\nJimmy\'s frank eyes met Mrs. Carew\'s gaze squarely, admiringly.\r\n\r\n"I think not," he smiled back at her. "I\'m sure I never have met you.\r\nI should have remembered it--if _I_ had met YOU," he bowed.\r\n\r\nSo unmistakable was his significant emphasis that everybody laughed,\r\nand John Pendleton chuckled:\r\n\r\n"Well done, son--for a youth of your tender years. I couldn\'t have\r\ndone half so well myself."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew flushed slightly and joined in the laugh.\r\n\r\n"No, but really," she urged; "joking aside, there certainly is a\r\nstrangely familiar something in your face. I think I must have SEEN\r\nyou somewhere, if I haven\'t actually met you."\r\n\r\n"And maybe you have," cried Pollyanna, "in Boston. Jimmy goes to Tech\r\nthere winters, you know. Jimmy\'s going to build bridges and dams, you\r\nsee--when he grows up, I mean," she finished with a merry glance at\r\nthe big six-foot fellow still standing before Mrs. Carew.\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed again--that is, everybody but Jamie; and only Sadie\r\nDean noticed that Jamie, instead of laughing, closed his eyes as if at\r\nthe sight of something that hurt. And only Sadie Dean knew how--and\r\nwhy--the subject was so quickly changed, for it was Sadie herself who\r\nchanged it. It was Sadie, too, who, when the opportunity came, saw to\r\nit that books and flowers and beasts and birds--things that Jamie knew\r\nand understood--were talked about as well as dams and bridges which\r\n(as Sadie knew), Jamie could never build. That Sadie did all this,\r\nhowever, was not realized by anybody, least of all by Jamie, the one\r\nwho most of all was concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen the call was over and the Pendletons had gone, Mrs. Carew\r\nreferred again to the curiously haunting feeling that somewhere she\r\nhad seen young Pendleton before.\r\n\r\n"I have, I know I have--somewhere," she declared musingly. "Of course\r\nit may have been in Boston; but--" She let the sentence remain\r\nunfinished; then, after a minute she added: "He\'s a fine young fellow,\r\nanyway. I like him."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad! I do, too," nodded Pollyanna. "I\'ve always liked Jimmy."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve known him some time, then?" queried Jamie, a little wistfully.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. I knew him years ago when I was a little girl, you know. He\r\nwas Jimmy Bean then."\r\n\r\n"Jimmy BEAN! Why, isn\'t he Mr. Pendleton\'s son?" asked Mrs. Carew, in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"No, only by adoption."\r\n\r\n"Adoption!" exclaimed Jamie. "Then HE isn\'t a real son any more than I\r\nam." There was a curious note of almost joy in the lad\'s voice.\r\n\r\n"No. Mr. Pendleton hasn\'t any children. He never married. He--he was\r\ngoing to, once, but he--he didn\'t." Pollyanna blushed and spoke with\r\nsudden diffidence. Pollyanna had never forgotten that it was her\r\nmother who, in the long ago, had said no to this same John Pendleton,\r\nand who had thus been responsible for the man\'s long, lonely years of\r\nbachelorhood.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew and Jamie, however, being unaware of this, and seeing now\r\nonly the blush on Pollyanna\'s cheek and the diffidence in her manner,\r\ndrew suddenly the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n"Is it possible," they asked themselves, "that this man, John\r\nPendleton, ever had a love affair with Pollyanna, child that she is?"\r\n\r\nNaturally they did not say this aloud; so, naturally, there was no\r\nanswer possible. Naturally, too, perhaps, the thought, though\r\nunspoken, was still not forgotten, but was tucked away in a corner of\r\ntheir minds for future reference--if need arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nSUMMER DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the Carews came, Pollyanna had told Jimmy that she was\r\ndepending on him to help her entertain them. Jimmy had not expressed\r\nhimself then as being overwhelmingly desirous to serve her in this\r\nway; but before the Carews had been in town a fortnight, he had shown\r\nhimself as not only willing but anxious,--judging by the frequency and\r\nlength of his calls, and the lavishness of his offers of the Pendleton\r\nhorses and motor cars.\r\n\r\nBetween him and Mrs. Carew there sprang up at once a warm friendship\r\nbased on what seemed to be a peculiarly strong attraction for each\r\nother. They walked and talked together, and even made sundry plans for\r\nthe Home for Working Girls, to be carried out the following winter\r\nwhen Jimmy should be in Boston. Jamie, too, came in for a good measure\r\nof attention, nor was Sadie Dean forgotten. Sadie, as Mrs. Carew\r\nplainly showed, was to be regarded as if she were quite one of the\r\nfamily; and Mrs. Carew was careful to see that she had full share in\r\nany plans for merrymaking.\r\n\r\nNor did Jimmy always come alone with his offers for entertainment.\r\nMore and more frequently John Pendleton appeared with him. Rides and\r\ndrives and picnics were planned and carried out, and long delightful\r\nafternoons were spent over books and fancy-work on the Harrington\r\nveranda.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was delighted. Not only were her paying guests being kept\r\nfrom any possibilities of ennui and homesickness, but her good\r\nfriends, the Carews, were becoming delightfully acquainted with her\r\nother good friends, the Pendletons. So, like a mother hen with a brood\r\nof chickens, she hovered over the veranda meetings, and did everything\r\nin her power to keep the group together and happy.\r\n\r\nNeither the Carews nor the Pendletons, however, were at all satisfied\r\nto have Pollyanna merely an onlooker in their pastimes, and very\r\nstrenuously they urged her to join them. They would not take no for an\r\nanswer, indeed, and Pollyanna very frequently found the way opened for\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Just as if we were going to have you poked up in this hot kitchen\r\nfrosting cake!" Jamie scolded one day, after he had penetrated the\r\nfastnesses of her domain. "It is a perfectly glorious morning, and\r\nwe\'re all going over to the Gorge and take our luncheon. And YOU are\r\ngoing with us."\r\n\r\n"But, Jamie, I can\'t--indeed I can\'t," refused Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Why not? You won\'t have dinner to get for us, for we sha\'n\'t be here\r\nto eat it."\r\n\r\n"But there\'s the--the luncheon."\r\n\r\n"Wrong again. We\'ll have the luncheon with us, so you CAN\'T stay home\r\nto get that. Now what\'s to hinder your going along WITH the luncheon,\r\neh?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Jamie, I--I can\'t. There\'s the cake to frost--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want it frosted."\r\n\r\n"And the dusting--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want it dusted."\r\n\r\n"And the ordering to do for to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Give us crackers and milk. We\'d lots rather have you and crackers and\r\nmilk than a turkey dinner and not you."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t begin to tell you the things I\'ve got to do to-day."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want you to begin to tell me," retorted Jamie, cheerfully. "I\r\nwant you to stop telling me. Come, put on your bonnet. I saw Betty in\r\nthe dining room, and she says she\'ll put our luncheon up. Now hurry."\r\n\r\n"Why, Jamie, you ridiculous boy, I can\'t go," laughed Pollyanna,\r\nholding feebly back, as he tugged at her dress-sleeve. "I can\'t go to\r\nthat picnic with you!"\r\n\r\nBut she went. She went not only then, but again and again. She could\r\nnot help going, indeed, for she found arrayed against her not only\r\nJamie, but Jimmy and Mr. Pendleton, to say nothing of Mrs. Carew and\r\nSadie Dean, and even Aunt Polly herself.\r\n\r\n"And of course I AM glad to go," she would sigh happily, when some\r\ndreary bit of work was taken out of her hands in spite of all\r\nprotesting. "But, surely, never before were there any boarders like\r\nmine--teasing for crackers-and-milk and cold things; and never before\r\nwas there a boarding mistress like me--running around the country\r\nafter this fashion!"\r\n\r\nThe climax came when one day John Pendleton (and Aunt Polly never\r\nceased to exclaim because it WAS John Pendleton)--suggested that they\r\nall go on a two weeks\' camping trip to a little lake up among the\r\nmountains forty miles from Beldingsville.\r\n\r\nThe idea was received with enthusiastic approbation by everybody\r\nexcept Aunt Polly. Aunt Polly said, privately, to Pollyanna, that it\r\nwas all very good and well and desirable that John Pendleton should\r\nhave gotten out of the sour, morose aloofness that had been his state\r\nfor so many years, but that it did not necessarily follow that it was\r\nequally desirable that he should be trying to turn himself into a\r\ntwenty-year-old boy again; and that was what, in her opinion, he\r\nseemed to be doing now! Publicly she contented herself with saying\r\ncoldly that SHE certainly should not go on any insane camping trip to\r\nsleep on damp ground and eat bugs and spiders, under the guise of\r\n"fun," nor did she think it a sensible thing for anybody over forty to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIf John Pendleton felt any wound from this shaft, he made no sign.\r\nCertainly there was no diminution of apparent interest and enthusiasm\r\non his part, and the plans for the camping expedition came on apace,\r\nfor it was unanimously decided that, even if Aunt Polly would not go,\r\nthat was no reason why the rest should not.\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Carew will be all the chaperon we need, anyhow," Jimmy had\r\ndeclared airily.\r\n\r\nFor a week, therefore, little was talked of but tents, food supplies,\r\ncameras, and fishing tackle, and little was done that was not a\r\npreparation in some way for the trip.\r\n\r\n"And let\'s make it the real thing," proposed Jimmy, eagerly, "--yes,\r\neven to Mrs. Chilton\'s bugs and spiders," he added, with a merry smile\r\nstraight into that lady\'s severely disapproving eyes. "None of your\r\nlog-cabin-central-dining-room idea for us! We want real camp-fires\r\nwith potatoes baked in the ashes, and we want to sit around and tell\r\nstories and roast corn on a stick."\r\n\r\n"And we want to swim and row and fish," chimed in Pollyanna. "And--"\r\nShe stopped suddenly, her eyes on Jamie\'s face. "That is, of course,"\r\nshe corrected quickly, "we wouldn\'t want to--to do those things all\r\nthe time. There\'d be a lot of QUIET things we\'d want to do, too--read\r\nand talk, you know."\r\n\r\nJamie\'s eyes darkened. His face grew a little white. His lips parted,\r\nbut before any words came, Sadie Dean was speaking.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but on camping trips and picnics, you know, we EXPECT to do\r\noutdoor stunts," she interposed feverishly; "and I\'m sure we WANT to.\r\nLast summer we were down in Maine, and you should have seen the fish\r\nMr. Carew caught. It was--You tell it," she begged, turning to Jamie.\r\n\r\nJamie laughed and shook his head.\r\n\r\n"They\'d never believe it," he objected; "--a fish story like that!"\r\n\r\n"Try us," challenged Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nJamie still shook his head--but the color had come back to his face,\r\nand his eyes were no longer somber as if with pain. Pollyanna,\r\nglancing at Sadie Dean, vaguely wondered why she suddenly settled back\r\nin her seat with so very evident an air of relief.\r\n\r\nAt last the appointed day came, and the start was made in John\r\nPendleton\'s big new touring car with Jimmy at the wheel. A whir, a\r\nthrobbing rumble, a chorus of good-bys, and they were off, with one\r\nlong shriek of the siren under Jimmy\'s mischievous fingers.\r\n\r\nIn after days Pollyanna often went back in her thoughts to that first\r\nnight in camp. The experience was so new and so wonderful in so many\r\nways.\r\n\r\nIt was four o\'clock when their forty-mile automobile journey came to\r\nan end. Since half-past three their big car had been ponderously\r\npicking its way over an old logging-road not designed for six-cylinder\r\nautomobiles. For the car itself, and for the hand at the wheel, this\r\npart of the trip was a most wearing one; but for the merry passengers,\r\nwho had no responsibility concerning hidden holes and muddy curves, it\r\nwas nothing but a delight growing more poignant with every new vista\r\nthrough the green arches, and with every echoing laugh that dodged the\r\nlow-hanging branches.\r\n\r\nThe site for the camp was one known to John Pendleton years before,\r\nand he greeted it now with a satisfied delight that was not unmingled\r\nwith relief.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how perfectly lovely!" chorused the others.\r\n\r\n"Glad you like it! I thought it would be about right," nodded John\r\nPendleton. "Still, I was a little anxious, after all, for these places\r\ndo change, you know, most remarkably sometimes. And of course this has\r\ngrown up to bushes a little--but not so but what we can easily clear\r\nit."\r\n\r\nEverybody fell to work then, clearing the ground, putting up the two\r\nlittle tents, unloading the automobile, building the camp fire, and\r\narranging the "kitchen and pantry."\r\n\r\nIt was then that Pollyanna began especially to notice Jamie, and to\r\nfear for him. She realized suddenly that the hummocks and hollows and\r\npine-littered knolls were not like a carpeted floor for a pair of\r\ncrutches, and she saw that Jamie was realizing it, too. She saw, also,\r\nthat in spite of his infirmity, he was trying to take his share in the\r\nwork; and the sight troubled her. Twice she hurried forward and\r\nintercepted him, taking from his arms the box he was trying to carry.\r\n\r\n"Here, let me take that," she begged. "You\'ve done enough." And the\r\nsecond time she added: "Do go and sit down somewhere to rest, Jamie.\r\nYou look so tired!"\r\n\r\nIf she had been watching closely she would have seen the quick color\r\nsweep to his forehead. But she was not watching, so she did not see\r\nit. She did see, however, to her intense surprise, Sadie Dean hurry\r\nforward a moment later, her arms full of boxes, and heard her cry:\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Carew, please, if you WOULD give me a lift with these!"\r\n\r\nThe next moment, Jamie, once more struggling with the problem of\r\nmanaging a bundle of boxes and two crutches, was hastening toward the\r\ntents.\r\n\r\nWith a quick word of protest on her tongue, Pollyanna turned to Sadie\r\nDean. But the protest died unspoken, for Sadie, her finger to her\r\nlips, was hurrying straight toward her.\r\n\r\n"I know you didn\'t think," she stammered in a low voice, as she\r\nreached Pollyanna\'s side. "But, don\'t you see?--it HURTS him--to have\r\nyou think he can\'t do things like other folks. There, look! See how\r\nhappy he is now."\r\n\r\nPollyanna looked, and she saw. She saw Jamie, his whole self alert,\r\ndeftly balance his weight on one crutch and swing his burden to the\r\nground. She saw the happy light on his face, and she heard him say\r\nnonchalantly:\r\n\r\n"Here\'s another contribution from Miss Dean. She asked me to bring\r\nthis over."\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, I see," breathed Pollyanna, turning to Sadie Dean. But\r\nSadie Dean had gone.\r\n\r\nPollyanna watched Jamie a good deal after that, though she was careful\r\nnot to let him, or any one else, see that she was watching him. And as\r\nshe watched, her heart ached. Twice she saw him essay a task and fail:\r\nonce with a box too heavy for him to lift; once with a folding-table\r\ntoo unwieldy for him to carry with his crutches. And each time she saw\r\nhis quick glance about him to see if others noticed. She saw, too,\r\nthat unmistakably he was getting very tired, and that his face, in\r\nspite of its gay smile, was looking white and drawn, as if he were in\r\npain.\r\n\r\n"I should think we might have known more," stormed Pollyanna hotly to\r\nherself, her eyes blinded with tears. "I should think we might have\r\nknown more than to have let him come to a place like this. Camping,\r\nindeed!--and with a pair of crutches! Why couldn\'t we have remembered\r\nbefore we started?"\r\n\r\nAn hour later, around the camp fire after supper, Pollyanna had her\r\nanswer to this question; for, with the glowing fire before her, and\r\nthe soft, fragrant dark all about her, she once more fell under the\r\nspell of the witchery that fell from Jamie\'s lips; and she once more\r\nforgot--Jamie\'s crutches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCOMRADES\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were a merry party--the six of them--and a congenial one. There\r\nseemed to be no end to the new delights that came with every new day,\r\nnot the least of which was the new charm of companionship that seemed\r\nto be a part of this new life they were living.\r\n\r\nAs Jamie said one night, when they were all sitting about the fire:\r\n\r\n"You see, we seem to know each other so much better up here in the\r\nwoods--better in a week than we would in a year in town."\r\n\r\n"I know it. I wonder why," murmured Mrs. Carew, her eyes dreamily\r\nfollowing the leaping blaze.\r\n\r\n"I think it\'s something in the air," sighed Pollyanna, happily.\r\n"There\'s something about the sky and the woods and the lake\r\nso--so--well, there just is; that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I think you mean, because the world is shut out," cried Sadie Dean,\r\nwith a curious little break in her voice. (Sadie had not joined in the\r\nlaugh that followed Pollyanna\'s limping conclusion.) "Up here\r\neverything is so real and true that we, too, can be our real true\r\nselves--not what the world SAYS we are because we are rich, or poor,\r\nor great, or humble; but what we really are, OURSELVES."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" scoffed Jimmy, airily. "All that sounds very fine; but the real\r\ncommon-sense reason is because we don\'t have any Mrs. Tom and Dick and\r\nHarry sitting on their side porches and commenting on every time we\r\nstir, and wondering among themselves where we are going, why we are\r\ngoing there, and how long we\'re intending to stay!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jimmy, how you do take the poetry out of things," reproached\r\nPollyanna, laughingly.\r\n\r\n"But that\'s my business," flashed Jimmy. "How do you suppose I\'m going\r\nto build dams and bridges if I don\'t see something besides poetry in\r\nthe waterfall?"\r\n\r\n"You can\'t, Pendleton! And it\'s the bridge--that counts--every time,"\r\ndeclared Jamie in a voice that brought a sudden hush to the group\r\nabout the fire. It was for only a moment, however, for almost at once\r\nSadie Dean broke the silence with a gay:\r\n\r\n"Pooh! I\'d rather have the waterfall every time, without ANY bridge\r\naround--to spoil the view!"\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed--and it was as if a tension somewhere snapped. Then\r\nMrs. Carew rose to her feet.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, children, your stern chaperon says it\'s bedtime!" And\r\nwith a merry chorus of good-nights the party broke up.\r\n\r\nAnd so the days passed. To Pollyanna they were wonderful days, and\r\nstill the most wonderful part was the charm of close companionship--a\r\ncompanionship that, while differing as to details with each one, was\r\nyet delightful with all.\r\n\r\nWith Sadie Dean she talked of the new Home, and of what a marvelous\r\nwork Mrs. Carew was doing. They talked, too, of the old days when\r\nSadie was selling bows behind the counter, and of what Mrs. Carew had\r\ndone for her. Pollyanna heard, also, something of the old father and\r\nmother "back home," and of the joy that Sadie, in her new position,\r\nhad been able to bring into their lives.\r\n\r\n"And after all it\'s really YOU that began it, you know," she said one\r\nday to Pollyanna. But Pollyanna only shook her head at this with an\r\nemphatic:\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! It was all Mrs. Carew."\r\n\r\nWith Mrs. Carew herself Pollyanna talked also of the Home, and of her\r\nplans for the girls. And once, in the hush of a twilight walk, Mrs.\r\nCarew spoke of herself and of her changed outlook on life. And she,\r\nlike Sadie Dean, said brokenly: "After all, it\'s really you that began\r\nit, Pollyanna." But Pollyanna, as in Sadie Dean\'s case, would have\r\nnone of this; and she began to talk of Jamie, and of what HE had done.\r\n\r\n"Jamie\'s a dear," Mrs. Carew answered affectionately. "And I love him\r\nlike an own son. He couldn\'t be dearer to me if he were really my\r\nsister\'s boy."\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t think he is?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. We\'ve never learned anything conclusive. Sometimes I\'m\r\nsure he is. Then again I doubt it. I think HE really believes he\r\nis--bless his heart! At all events, one thing is sure: he has good\r\nblood in him from somewhere. Jamie\'s no ordinary waif of the streets,\r\nyou know, with his talents; and the wonderful way he has responded to\r\nteaching and training proves it."\r\n\r\n"Of course," nodded Pollyanna. "And as long as you love him so well,\r\nit doesn\'t really matter, anyway, does it, whether he\'s the real Jamie\r\nor not?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew hesitated. Into her eyes crept the old somberness of\r\nheartache.\r\n\r\n"Not so far as he is concerned," she sighed, at last. "It\'s only that\r\nsometimes I get to thinking: if he isn\'t our Jamie, where is--Jamie\r\nKent? Is he well? Is he happy? Has he any one to love him? When I get\r\nto thinking like that, Pollyanna, I\'m nearly wild. I\'d give--everything\r\nI have in the world, it seems to me, to really KNOW that this boy is\r\nJamie Kent."\r\n\r\nPollyanna used to think of this conversation sometimes, in her after\r\ntalks with Jamie. Jamie was so sure of himself.\r\n\r\n"It\'s just somehow that I FEEL it\'s so," he said once to Pollyanna. "I\r\nbelieve I am Jamie Kent. I\'ve believed it quite a while. I\'m afraid\r\nI\'ve believed it so long now, that--that I just couldn\'t bear it, to\r\nfind out I wasn\'t he. Mrs. Carew has done so much for me; just think\r\nif, after all, I were only a stranger!"\r\n\r\n"But she--loves you, Jamie."\r\n\r\n"I know she does--and that would only hurt all the more--don\'t you\r\nsee?--because it would be hurting her. SHE wants me to be the real\r\nJamie. I know she does. Now if I could only DO something for her--make\r\nher proud of me in some way! If I could only do something to support\r\nmyself, even, like a man! But what can I do, with--these?" He spoke\r\nbitterly, and laid his hand on the crutches at his side.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was shocked and distressed. It was the first time she had\r\nheard Jamie speak of his infirmity since the old boyhood days.\r\nFrantically she cast about in her mind for just the right thing to\r\nsay; but before she had even thought of anything, Jamie\'s face had\r\nundergone a complete change.\r\n\r\n"But, there, forget it! I didn\'t mean to say it," he cried gaily. "And\r\n\'twas rank heresy to the game, wasn\'t it? I\'m sure I\'m GLAD I\'ve got\r\nthe crutches. They\'re a whole lot nicer than the wheel chair!"\r\n\r\n"And the Jolly Book--do you keep it now?" asked Pollyanna, in a voice\r\nthat trembled a little.\r\n\r\n"Sure! I\'ve got a whole library of jolly books now," he retorted.\r\n"They\'re all in leather, dark red, except the first one. That is the\r\nsame little old notebook that Jerry gave me."\r\n\r\n"Jerry! And I\'ve been meaning all the time to ask for him," cried\r\nPollyanna. "Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"In Boston; and his vocabulary is just as picturesque as ever, only he\r\nhas to tone it down at times. Jerry\'s still in the newspaper\r\nbusiness--but he\'s GETTING the news, not selling it. Reporting, you\r\nknow. I HAVE been able to help him and mumsey. And don\'t you suppose I\r\nwas glad? Mumsey\'s in a sanatorium for her rheumatism."\r\n\r\n"And is she better?"\r\n\r\n"Very much. She\'s coming out pretty soon, and going to housekeeping\r\nwith Jerry. Jerry\'s been making up some of his lost schooling during\r\nthese past few years. He\'s let me help him--but only as a loan. He\'s\r\nbeen very particular to stipulate that."\r\n\r\n"Of course," nodded Pollyanna, in approval. "He\'d want it that way,\r\nI\'m sure. I should. It isn\'t nice to be under obligations that you\r\ncan\'t pay. I know how it is. That\'s why I so wish I could help Aunt\r\nPolly out--after all she\'s done for me!"\r\n\r\n"But you are helping her this summer."\r\n\r\nPollyanna lifted her eyebrows.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'m keeping summer boarders. I look it, don\'t I?" she\r\nchallenged, with a flourish of her hands toward her surroundings.\r\n"Surely, never was a boarding-house mistress\'s task quite like mine!\r\nAnd you should have heard Aunt Polly\'s dire predictions of what summer\r\nboarders would be," she chuckled irrepressibly.\r\n\r\n"What was that?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna shook her head decidedly.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t possibly tell you. That\'s a dead secret. But--" She stopped\r\nand sighed, her face growing wistful again. "This isn\'t going to last,\r\nyou know. It can\'t. Summer boarders don\'t. I\'ve got to do something\r\nwinters. I\'ve been thinking. I believe--I\'ll write stories."\r\n\r\nJamie turned with a start.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll--what?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Write stories--to sell, you know. You needn\'t look so surprised! Lots\r\nof folks do that. I knew two girls in Germany who did."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever try it?" Jamie still spoke a little queerly.\r\n\r\n"N-no; not yet," admitted Pollyanna. Then, defensively, in answer to\r\nthe expression on his face, she bridled: "I TOLD you I was keeping\r\nsummer boarders now. I can\'t do both at once."\r\n\r\n"Of course not!"\r\n\r\nShe threw him a reproachful glance.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think I can ever do it?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t say so."\r\n\r\n"No; but you look it. I don\'t see why I can\'t. It isn\'t like singing.\r\nYou don\'t have to have a voice for it. And it isn\'t like an instrument\r\nthat you have to learn how to play."\r\n\r\n"I think it is--a little--like that." Jamie\'s voice was low. His eyes\r\nwere turned away.\r\n\r\n"How? What do you mean? Why, Jamie, just a pencil and paper, so--that\r\nisn\'t like learning to play the piano or violin!"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s silence. Then came the answer, still in that low,\r\ndiffident voice; still with the eyes turned away.\r\n\r\n"The instrument that you play on, Pollyanna, will be the great heart\r\nof the world; and to me that seems the most wonderful instrument of\r\nall--to learn. Under your touch, if you are skilful, it will respond\r\nwith smiles or tears, as you will."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'The instrument that you play on, Pollyanna, will be\r\nthe great heart of the world\'"]\r\n\r\nPollyanna drew a tremulous sigh. Her eyes grew wet.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jamie, how beautifully you do put things--always! I never thought\r\nof it that way. But it\'s so, isn\'t it? How I would love to do it!\r\nMaybe I couldn\'t do--all that. But I\'ve read stories in the magazines,\r\nlots of them. Seems as if I could write some like those, anyway. I\r\nLOVE to tell stories. I\'m always repeating those you tell, and I\r\nalways laugh and cry, too, just as I do when YOU tell them."\r\n\r\nJamie turned quickly.\r\n\r\n"DO they make you laugh and cry, Pollyanna--really?" There was a\r\ncurious eagerness in his voice.\r\n\r\n"Of course they do, and you know it, Jamie. And they used to long ago,\r\ntoo, in the Public Garden. Nobody can tell stories like you, Jamie.\r\nYOU ought to be the one writing stories; not I. And, say, Jamie, why\r\ndon\'t you? You could do it lovely, I know!"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. Jamie, apparently, did not hear; perhaps because\r\nhe called, at that instant, to a chipmunk that was scurrying through\r\nthe bushes near by.\r\n\r\nIt was not always with Jamie, nor yet with Mrs. Carew and Sadie Dean\r\nthat Pollyanna had delightful walks and talks, however; very often it\r\nwas with Jimmy, or John Pendleton.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was sure now that she had never before known John Pendleton.\r\nThe old taciturn moroseness seemed entirely gone since they came to\r\ncamp. He rowed and swam and fished and tramped with fully as much\r\nenthusiasm as did Jimmy himself, and with almost as much vigor. Around\r\nthe camp fire at night he quite rivaled Jamie with his story-telling\r\nof adventures, both laughable and thrilling, that had befallen him in\r\nhis foreign travels.\r\n\r\n"In the \'Desert of Sarah,\' Nancy used to call it," laughed Pollyanna\r\none night, as she joined the rest in begging for a story.\r\n\r\nBetter than all this, however, in Pollyanna\'s opinion, were the times\r\nwhen John Pendleton, with her alone, talked of her mother as he used\r\nto know her and love her, in the days long gone. That he did so talk\r\nwith her was a joy to Pollyanna, but a great surprise, too; for, never\r\nin the past, had John Pendleton talked so freely of the girl whom he\r\nhad so loved--hopelessly. Perhaps John Pendleton himself felt some of\r\nthe surprise, for once he said to Pollyanna, musingly:\r\n\r\n"I wonder why I\'m talking to you like this."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I love to have you," breathed Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know--but I wouldn\'t think I would do it. It must be, though,\r\nthat it\'s because you are so like her, as I knew her. You are very\r\nlike your mother, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought my mother was BEAUTIFUL!" cried Pollyanna, in\r\nunconcealed amazement.\r\n\r\nJohn Pendleton smiled quizzically.\r\n\r\n"She was, my dear."\r\n\r\nPollyanna looked still more amazed.\r\n\r\n"Then I don\'t see how I CAN be like her!"\r\n\r\nThe man laughed outright.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, if some girls had said that, I--well, never mind what I\'d\r\nsay. You little witch!--you poor, homely little Pollyanna!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna flashed a genuinely distressed reproof straight into the\r\nman\'s merry eyes.\r\n\r\n"Please, Mr. Pendleton, don\'t look like that, and don\'t tease\r\nme--about THAT. I\'d so LOVE to be beautiful--though of course it\r\nsounds silly to say it. And I HAVE a mirror, you know."\r\n\r\n"Then I advise you to look in it--when you\'re talking sometime,"\r\nobserved the man sententiously.\r\n\r\nPollyanna\'s eyes flew wide open.\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s just what Jimmy said," she cried.\r\n\r\n"Did he, indeed--the young rascal!" retorted John Pendleton, dryly.\r\nThen, with one of the curiously abrupt changes of manner peculiar to\r\nhim, he said, very low: "You have your mother\'s eyes and smile,\r\nPollyanna; and to me you are--beautiful."\r\n\r\nAnd Pollyanna, her eyes blinded with sudden hot tears, was silenced.\r\n\r\nDear as were these talks, however, they still were not quite like the\r\ntalks with Jimmy, to Pollyanna. For that matter, she and Jimmy did not\r\nneed to TALK to be happy. Jimmy was always so comfortable, and\r\ncomforting; whether they talked or not did not matter. Jimmy always\r\nunderstood. There was no pulling on her heart-strings for sympathy,\r\nwith Jimmy--Jimmy was delightfully big, and strong, and happy. Jimmy\r\nwas not sorrowing for a long-lost nephew, nor pining for the loss of a\r\nboyhood sweetheart. Jimmy did not have to swing himself painfully\r\nabout on a pair of crutches--all of which was so hard to see, and\r\nknow, and think of. With Jimmy one could be just glad, and happy, and\r\nfree. Jimmy was such a dear! He always rested one so--did Jimmy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n"TIED TO TWO STICKS"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the last day at camp that it happened. To Pollyanna it\r\nseemed such a pity that it should have happened at all, for it was the\r\nfirst cloud to bring a shadow of regret and unhappiness to her heart\r\nduring the whole trip, and she found herself futilely sighing:\r\n\r\n"I wish we\'d gone home day before yesterday; then it wouldn\'t have\r\nhappened."\r\n\r\nBut they had not gone home "day before yesterday," and it had\r\nhappened; and this was the manner of it.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of that last day they had all started on a\r\ntwo-mile tramp to "the Basin."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have one more bang-up fish dinner before we go," Jimmy had\r\nsaid. And the rest had joyfully agreed.\r\n\r\nWith luncheon and fishing tackle, therefore, they had made an early\r\nstart. Laughing and calling gaily to each other they followed the\r\nnarrow path through the woods, led by Jimmy, who best knew the way.\r\n\r\nAt first, close behind Jimmy had walked Pollyanna; but gradually she\r\nhad fallen back with Jamie, who was last in the line: Pollyanna had\r\nthought she detected on Jamie\'s face the expression which she had come\r\nto know was there only when he was attempting something that taxed\r\nalmost to the breaking-point his skill and powers of endurance. She\r\nknew that nothing would so offend him as to have her openly notice\r\nthis state of affairs. At the same time, she also knew that from her,\r\nmore willingly than from any one else, would he accept an occasional\r\nsteadying hand over a troublesome log or stone. Therefore, at the\r\nfirst opportunity to make the change without apparent design, she had\r\ndropped back step by step until she had reached her goal, Jamie. She\r\nhad been rewarded instantly in the way Jamie\'s face brightened, and in\r\nthe easy assurance with which he met and conquered a fallen tree-trunk\r\nacross their path, under the pleasant fiction (carefully fostered by\r\nPollyanna) of "helping her across."\r\n\r\nOnce out of the woods, their way led along an old stone wall for a\r\ntime, with wide reaches of sunny, sloping pastures on each side, and a\r\nmore distant picturesque farmhouse. It was in the adjoining pasture\r\nthat Pollyanna saw the goldenrod which she immediately coveted.\r\n\r\n"Jamie, wait! I\'m going to get it," she exclaimed eagerly. "It\'ll make\r\nsuch a beautiful bouquet for our picnic table!" And nimbly she\r\nscrambled over the high stone wall and dropped herself down on the\r\nother side.\r\n\r\nIt was strange how tantalizing was that goldenrod. Always just ahead\r\nshe saw another bunch, and yet another, each a little finer than the\r\none within her reach. With joyous exclamations and gay little calls\r\nback to the waiting Jamie, Pollyanna--looking particularly attractive\r\nin her scarlet sweater--skipped from bunch to bunch, adding to her\r\nstore. She had both hands full when there came the hideous bellow of\r\nan angry bull, the agonized shout from Jamie, and the sound of hoofs\r\nthundering down the hillside.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next was never clear to her. She knew she dropped her\r\ngoldenrod and ran--ran as she never ran before, ran as she thought she\r\nnever could run--back toward the wall and Jamie. She knew that behind\r\nher the hoof-beats were gaining, gaining, always gaining. Dimly,\r\nhopelessly, far ahead of her, she saw Jamie\'s agonized face, and heard his\r\nhoarse cries. Then, from somewhere, came a new voice--Jimmy\'s--shouting\r\na cheery call of courage.\r\n\r\nStill on and on she ran blindly, hearing nearer and nearer the thud of\r\nthose pounding hoofs. Once she stumbled and almost fell. Then, dizzily\r\nshe righted herself and plunged forward. She felt her strength quite\r\ngone when suddenly, close to her, she heard Jimmy\'s cheery call again.\r\nThe next minute she felt herself snatched off her feet and held close\r\nto a great throbbing something that dimly she realized was Jimmy\'s\r\nheart. It was all a horrid blur then of cries, hot, panting breaths,\r\nand pounding hoofs thundering nearer, ever nearer. Then, just as she\r\nknew those hoofs to be almost upon her, she felt herself flung, still\r\nin Jimmy\'s arms, sharply to one side, and yet not so far but that she\r\nstill could feel the hot breath of the maddened animal as he dashed\r\nby. Almost at once then she found herself on the other side of the\r\nwall, with Jimmy bending over her, imploring her to tell him she was\r\nnot dead.\r\n\r\nWith an hysterical laugh that was yet half a sob, she struggled out of\r\nhis arms and stood upon her feet.\r\n\r\n"Dead? No, indeed--thanks to you, Jimmy. I\'m all right. I\'m all right.\r\nOh, how glad, glad, glad I was to hear your voice! Oh, that was\r\nsplendid! How did you do it?" she panted.\r\n\r\n"Pooh! That was nothing. I just--" An inarticulate choking cry brought\r\nhis words to a sudden halt. He turned to find Jamie face down on the\r\nground, a little distance away. Pollyanna was already hurrying toward\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Jamie, Jamie, what is the matter?" she cried. "Did you fall? Are you\r\nhurt?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer.\r\n\r\n"What is it, old fellow? ARE you hurt?" demanded Jimmy.\r\n\r\nStill there was no answer. Then, suddenly, Jamie pulled himself half\r\nupright and turned. They saw his face then, and fell back, shocked and\r\namazed.\r\n\r\n"Hurt? Am I hurt?" he choked huskily, flinging out both his hands.\r\n"Don\'t you suppose it hurts to see a thing like that and not be able\r\nto do anything? To be tied, helpless, to a pair of sticks? I tell you\r\nthere\'s no hurt in all the world to equal it!"\r\n\r\n"But--but--Jamie," faltered Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t!" interrupted the cripple, almost harshly. He had struggled to\r\nhis feet now. "Don\'t say--anything. I didn\'t mean to make a\r\nscene--like this," he finished brokenly, as he turned and swung back\r\nalong the narrow path that led to the camp.\r\n\r\nFor a minute, as if transfixed, the two behind him watched him go.\r\n\r\n"Well, by--Jove!" breathed Jimmy, then, in a voice that shook a\r\nlittle, "That was--tough on him!"\r\n\r\n"And I didn\'t think, and PRAISED you, right before him," half-sobbed\r\nPollyanna. "And his hands--did you see them? They were--BLEEDING where\r\nthe nails had cut right into the flesh," she finished, as she turned\r\nand stumbled blindly up the path.\r\n\r\n"But, Pollyanna, w-where are you going?" cried Jimmy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m going to Jamie, of course! Do you think I\'d leave him like that?\r\nCome, we must get him to come back."\r\n\r\nAnd Jimmy, with a sigh that was not all for Jamie, went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nJIMMY WAKES UP\r\n\r\n\r\nOutwardly the camping trip was pronounced a great success; but\r\ninwardly--\r\n\r\nPollyanna wondered sometimes if it were all herself, or if there\r\nreally were a peculiar, indefinable constraint in everybody with\r\neverybody else. Certainly she felt it, and she thought she saw\r\nevidences that the others felt it, too. As for the cause of it\r\nall--unhesitatingly she attributed it to that last day at camp with\r\nits unfortunate trip to the Basin.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, she and Jimmy had easily caught up with Jamie, and had,\r\nafter considerable coaxing, persuaded him to turn about and go on to\r\nthe Basin with them. But, in spite of everybody\'s very evident efforts\r\nto act as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened, nobody really\r\nsucceeded in doing so. Pollyanna, Jamie, and Jimmy overdid their\r\ngayety a bit, perhaps; and the others, while not knowing exactly what\r\nhad happened, very evidently felt that something was not quite right,\r\nthough they plainly tried to hide the fact that they did feel so.\r\nNaturally, in this state of affairs, restful happiness was out of the\r\nquestion. Even the anticipated fish dinner was flavorless; and early\r\nin the afternoon the start was made back to the camp.\r\n\r\nOnce home again, Pollyanna had hoped that the unhappy episode of the\r\nangry bull would be forgotten. But she could not forget it, so in all\r\nfairness she could not blame the others if they could not. Always she\r\nthought of it now when she looked at Jamie. She saw again the agony on\r\nhis face, the crimson stain on the palms of his hands. Her heart ached\r\nfor him, and because it did so ache, his mere presence had come to be\r\na pain to her. Remorsefully she confessed to herself that she did not\r\nlike to be with Jamie now, nor to talk with him--but that did not mean\r\nthat she was not often with him. She was with him, indeed, much\r\noftener than before, for so remorseful was she, and so fearful was she\r\nthat he would detect her unhappy frame of mind, that she lost no\r\nopportunity of responding to his overtures of comradeship; and\r\nsometimes she deliberately sought him out. This last she did not often\r\nhave to do, however, for more and more frequently these days Jamie\r\nseemed to be turning to her for companionship.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this, Pollyanna believed, was to be found in this same\r\nincident of the bull and the rescue. Not that Jamie ever referred to\r\nit directly. He never did that. He was, too, even gayer than usual;\r\nbut Pollyanna thought she detected sometimes a bitterness underneath\r\nit all that was never there before. Certainly she could not help\r\nseeing that at times he seemed almost to want to avoid the others, and\r\nthat he actually sighed, as if with relief, when he found himself\r\nalone with her. She thought she knew why this was so, after he said to\r\nher, as he did say one day, while they were watching the others play\r\ntennis:\r\n\r\n"You see, after all, Pollyanna, there isn\'t any one who can quite\r\nunderstand as you can."\r\n\r\n"\'Understand\'?" Pollyanna had not known what he meant at first. They\r\nhad been watching the players for five minutes without a word between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Yes; for you, once--couldn\'t walk--yourself."\r\n\r\n"Oh-h, yes, I know," faltered Pollyanna; and she knew that her great\r\ndistress must have shown in her face, for so quickly and so blithely\r\ndid he change the subject, after a laughing:\r\n\r\n"Come, come, Pollyanna, why don\'t you tell me to play the game? I\r\nwould if I were in your place. Forget it, please. I was a brute to\r\nmake you look like that!"\r\n\r\nAnd Pollyanna smiled, and said: "No, no--no, indeed!" But she did not\r\n"forget it." She could not. And it all made her only the more anxious\r\nto be with Jamie and help him all she could.\r\n\r\n"As if NOW I\'d ever let him see that I was ever anything but glad when\r\nhe was with me!" she thought fervently, as she hurried forward a\r\nminute later to take her turn in the game.\r\n\r\nPollyanna, however, was not the only one in the party who felt a new\r\nawkwardness and constraint. Jimmy Pendleton felt it, though he, too,\r\ntried not to show it.\r\n\r\nJimmy was not happy these days. From a care-free youth whose visions\r\nwere of wonderful spans across hitherto unbridgeable chasms, he has\r\ncome to be an anxious-eyed young man whose visions were of a feared\r\nrival bearing away the girl he loved.\r\n\r\nJimmy knew very well now that he was in love with Pollyanna. He\r\nsuspected that he had been in love with her for some time. He stood\r\naghast, indeed, to find himself so shaken and powerless before this\r\nthing that had come to him. He knew that even his beloved bridges were\r\nas nothing when weighed against the smile in a girl\'s eyes and the\r\nword on a girl\'s lips. He realized that the most wonderful span in the\r\nworld to him would be the thing that could help him to cross the chasm\r\nof fear and doubt that he felt lay between him and Pollyanna--doubt\r\nbecause of Pollyanna; fear because of Jamie.\r\n\r\nNot until he had seen Pollyanna in jeopardy that day in the pasture\r\nhad he realized how empty would be the world--his world--without her.\r\nNot until his wild dash for safety with Pollyanna in his arms had he\r\nrealized how precious she was to him. For a moment, indeed, with his\r\narms about her, and hers clinging about his neck, he had felt that she\r\nwas indeed his; and even in that supreme moment of danger he knew the\r\nthrill of supreme bliss. Then, a little later, he had seen Jamie\'s\r\nface, and Jamie\'s hands. To him they could mean but one thing: Jamie,\r\ntoo, loved Pollyanna, and Jamie had to stand by, helpless--"tied to\r\ntwo sticks." That was what he had said. Jimmy believed that, had he\r\nhimself been obliged to stand by helpless, "tied to two sticks," while\r\nanother rescued the girl that he loved, he would have looked like\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nJimmy had gone back to camp that day with his thoughts in a turmoil of\r\nfear and rebellion. He wondered if Pollyanna cared for Jamie; that was\r\nwhere the fear came in. But even if she did care, a little, must he\r\nstand aside, weakly, and let Jamie, without a struggle, make her learn\r\nto care more? That was where the rebellion came in. Indeed, no, he\r\nwould not do it, decided Jimmy. It should be a fair fight between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThen, all by himself as he was, Jimmy flushed hot to the roots of his\r\nhair. Would it be a "fair" fight? Could any fight between him and\r\nJamie be a "fair" fight? Jimmy felt suddenly as he had felt years\r\nbefore when, as a lad, he had challenged a new boy to a fight for an\r\napple they both claimed, then, at the first blow, had discovered that\r\nthe new boy had a crippled arm. He had purposely lost then, of course,\r\nand had let the crippled boy win. But he told himself fiercely now\r\nthat this case was different. It was no apple that was at stake. It\r\nwas his life\'s happiness. It might even be Pollyanna\'s life\'s\r\nhappiness, too. Perhaps she did not care for Jamie at all, but would\r\ncare for her old friend, Jimmy, if he but once showed her he wanted\r\nher to care. And he would show her. He would--\r\n\r\nOnce again Jimmy blushed hotly. But he frowned, too, angrily: if only\r\nhe COULD forget how Jamie had looked when he had uttered that moaning\r\n"tied to two sticks!" If only--But what was the use? It was NOT a fair\r\nfight, and he knew it. He knew, too, right there and then, that his\r\ndecision would be just what it afterwards proved to be: he would watch\r\nand wait. He would give Jamie his chance; and if Pollyanna showed that\r\nshe cared, he would take himself off and away quite out of their\r\nlives; and they should never know, either of them, how bitterly he was\r\nsuffering. He would go back to his bridges--as if any bridge, though\r\nit led to the moon itself, could compare for a moment with Pollyanna!\r\nBut he would do it. He must do it.\r\n\r\nIt was all very fine and heroic, and Jimmy felt so exalted he was\r\natingle with something that was almost happiness when he finally\r\ndropped off to sleep that night. But martyrdom in theory and practice\r\ndiffers woefully, as would-be martyrs have found out from time\r\nimmemorial. It was all very well to decide alone and in the dark that\r\nhe would give Jamie his chance; but it was quite another matter really\r\nto do it when it involved nothing less than the leaving of Pollyanna\r\nand Jamie together almost every time he saw them. Then, too, he was\r\nvery much worried at Pollyanna\'s apparent attitude toward the lame\r\nyouth. It looked very much to Jimmy as if she did indeed care for him,\r\nso watchful was she of his comfort, so apparently eager to be with\r\nhim. Then, as if to settle any possible doubt in Jimmy\'s mind, there\r\ncame the day when Sadie Dean had something to say on the subject.\r\n\r\nThey were all out in the tennis court. Sadie was sitting alone when\r\nJimmy strolled up to her.\r\n\r\n"You next with Pollyanna, isn\'t it?" he queried.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna isn\'t playing any more this morning."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t playing!" frowned Jimmy, who had been counting on his own game\r\nwith Pollyanna. "Why not?"\r\n\r\nFor a brief minute Sadie Dean did not answer; then with very evident\r\ndifficulty she said:\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna told me last night that she thought we were playing tennis\r\ntoo much; that it wasn\'t kind to--Mr. Carew, as long as he can\'t\r\nplay."\r\n\r\n"I know; but--" Jimmy stopped helplessly, the frown plowing a deeper\r\nfurrow into his forehead. The next instant he fairly started with\r\nsurprise at the tense something in Sadie Dean\'s voice, as she said:\r\n\r\n"But he doesn\'t want her to stop. He doesn\'t want any one of us to\r\nmake any difference--for him. It\'s that that hurts him so. She doesn\'t\r\nunderstand. She doesn\'t understand! But I do. She thinks she does,\r\nthough!"\r\n\r\nSomething in words or manner sent a sudden pang to Jimmy\'s heart. He\r\nthrew a sharp look into her face. A question flew to his lips. For a\r\nmoment he held it back; then, trying to hide his earnestness with a\r\nbantering smile, he let it come.\r\n\r\n"Why, Miss Dean, you don\'t mean to convey the idea that--that there\'s\r\nany SPECIAL interest in each other--between those two, do you?"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a scornful glance.\r\n\r\n"Where have your eyes been? She worships him! I mean--they worship\r\neach other," she corrected hastily.\r\n\r\nJimmy, with an inarticulate ejaculation, turned and walked away\r\nabruptly. He could not trust himself to remain longer. He did not wish\r\nto talk any more, just then, to Sadie Dean. So abruptly, indeed, did\r\nhe turn, that he did not notice that Sadie Dean, too, turned\r\nhurriedly, and busied herself looking in the grass at her feet, as if\r\nshe had lost something. Very evidently, Sadie Dean, also, did not wish\r\nto talk any more just then.\r\n\r\nJimmy Pendleton told himself that it was not true at all; that it was\r\nall falderal, what Sadie Dean had said. Yet nevertheless, true or not\r\ntrue, he could not forget it. It colored all his thoughts thereafter,\r\nand loomed before his eyes like a shadow whenever he saw Pollyanna and\r\nJamie together. He watched their faces covertly. He listened to the\r\ntones of their voices. He came then, in time, to think it was, after\r\nall, true: that they did worship each other; and his heart, in\r\nconsequence, grew like lead within him. True to his promise to\r\nhimself, however, he turned resolutely away. The die was cast, he told\r\nhimself. Pollyanna was not to be for him.\r\n\r\nRestless days for Jimmy followed. To stay away from the Harrington\r\nhomestead entirely he did not dare, lest his secret be suspected. To\r\nbe with Pollyanna at all now was torture. Even to be with Sadie Dean\r\nwas unpleasant, for he could not forget that it was Sadie Dean who had\r\nfinally opened his eyes. Jamie, certainly, was no haven of refuge,\r\nunder the circumstances; and that left only Mrs. Carew. Mrs. Carew,\r\nhowever, was a host in herself, and Jimmy found his only comfort these\r\ndays in her society. Gay or grave, she always seemed to know how to\r\nfit his mood exactly; and it was wonderful how much she knew about\r\nbridges--the kind of bridges he was going to build. She was so wise,\r\ntoo, and so sympathetic, knowing always just the right word to say. He\r\neven one day almost told her about The Packet; but John Pendleton\r\ninterrupted them at just the wrong moment, so the story was not told.\r\nJohn Pendleton was always interrupting them at just the wrong moment,\r\nJimmy thought vexedly, sometimes. Then, when he remembered what John\r\nPendleton had done for him, he was ashamed.\r\n\r\n"The Packet" was a thing that dated back to Jimmy\'s boyhood, and had\r\nnever been mentioned to any one save to John Pendleton, and that only\r\nonce, at the time of his adoption. The Packet was nothing but rather a\r\nlarge white envelope, worn with time, and plump with mystery behind a\r\nhuge red seal. It had been given him by his father, and it bore the\r\nfollowing instructions in his father\'s hand:\r\n\r\n"To my boy, Jimmy. Not to be opened until his thirtieth birthday\r\nexcept in case of his death, when it shall be opened at once."\r\n\r\nThere were times when Jimmy speculated a good deal as to the contents\r\nof that envelope. There were other times when he forgot its existence.\r\nIn the old days, at the Orphans\' Home, his chief terror had been that\r\nit should be discovered and taken away from him. In those days he wore\r\nit always hidden in the lining of his coat. Of late years, at John\r\nPendleton\'s suggestion, it had been tucked away in the Pendleton safe.\r\n\r\n"For there\'s no knowing how valuable it may be," John Pendleton had\r\nsaid, with a smile. "And, anyway, your father evidently wanted you to\r\nhave it, and we wouldn\'t want to run the risk of losing it."\r\n\r\n"No, I wouldn\'t want to lose it, of course," Jimmy had smiled back, a\r\nlittle soberly. "But I\'m not counting on its being real valuable, sir.\r\nPoor dad didn\'t have anything that was very valuable about him, as I\r\nremember."\r\n\r\nIt was this Packet that Jimmy came so near mentioning to Mrs. Carew\r\none day,--if only John Pendleton had not interrupted them.\r\n\r\n"Still, maybe it\'s just as well I didn\'t tell her about it," Jimmy\r\nreflected afterwards, on his way home. "She might have thought dad had\r\nsomething in his life that wasn\'t quite--right. And I wouldn\'t have\r\nwanted her to think that--of dad."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE GAME AND POLLYANNA\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of September the Carews and Sadie Dean said good-by\r\nand went back to Boston. Much as she knew she would miss them,\r\nPollyanna drew an actual sigh of relief as the train bearing them away\r\nrolled out of the Beldingsville station. Pollyanna would not have\r\nadmitted having this feeling of relief to any one else, and even to\r\nherself she apologized in her thoughts.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that I don\'t love them dearly, every one of them," she\r\nsighed, watching the train disappear around the curve far down the\r\ntrack. "It\'s only that--that I\'m so sorry for poor Jamie all the time;\r\nand--and--I am tired. I shall be glad, for a while, just to go back to\r\nthe old quiet days with Jimmy."\r\n\r\nPollyanna, however, did not go back to the old quiet days with Jimmy.\r\nThe days that immediately followed the going of the Carews were quiet,\r\ncertainly, but they were not passed "with Jimmy." Jimmy rarely came\r\nnear the house now, and when he did call, he was not the old Jimmy\r\nthat she used to know. He was moody, restless, and silent, or else\r\nvery gay and talkative in a nervous fashion that was most puzzling and\r\nannoying. Before long, too, he himself went to Boston; and then of\r\ncourse she did not see him at all.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was surprised then to see how much she missed him. Even to\r\nknow that he was in town, and that there was a chance that he might\r\ncome over, was better than the dreary emptiness of certain absence;\r\nand even his puzzling moods of alternating gloominess and gayety were\r\npreferable to this utter silence of nothingness. Then, one day,\r\nsuddenly she pulled herself up with hot cheeks and shamed eyes.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pollyanna Whittier," she upbraided herself sharply, "one would\r\nthink you were in LOVE with Jimmy Bean Pendleton! Can\'t you think of\r\nANYTHING but him?"\r\n\r\nWhereupon, forthwith, she bestirred herself to be very gay and lively\r\nindeed, and to put this Jimmy Bean Pendleton out of her thoughts. As\r\nit happened, Aunt Polly, though unwittingly, helped her to this.\r\n\r\nWith the going of the Carews had gone also their chief source of\r\nimmediate income, and Aunt Polly was beginning to worry again,\r\naudibly, about the state of their finances.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, really, Pollyanna, what IS going to become of us," she\r\nwould moan frequently. "Of course we are a little ahead now from this\r\nsummer\'s work, and we have a small sum from the estate right along;\r\nbut I never know how soon that\'s going to stop, like all the rest. If\r\nonly we could do something to bring in some ready cash!"\r\n\r\nIt was after one of these moaning lamentations one day that\r\nPollyanna\'s eyes chanced to fall on a prize-story contest offer. It\r\nwas a most alluring one. The prizes were large and numerous. The\r\nconditions were set forth in glowing terms. To read it, one would\r\nthink that to win out were the easiest thing in the world. It\r\ncontained even a special appeal that might have been framed for\r\nPollyanna herself.\r\n\r\n"This is for you--you who read this," it ran. "What if you never have\r\nwritten a story before! That is no sign you cannot write one. Try it.\r\nThat\'s all. Wouldn\'t YOU like three thousand dollars? Two thousand?\r\nOne thousand? Five hundred, or even one hundred? Then why not go after\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"The very thing!" cried Pollyanna, clapping her hands. "I\'m so glad I\r\nsaw it! And it says I can do it, too. I thought I could, if I\'d just\r\ntry. I\'ll go tell auntie, so she needn\'t worry any more."\r\n\r\nPollyanna was on her feet and half way to the door when a second\r\nthought brought her steps to a pause.\r\n\r\n"Come to think of it, I reckon I won\'t, after all. It\'ll be all the\r\nnicer to surprise her; and if I SHOULD get the first one--!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna went to sleep that night planning what she COULD do with\r\nthat three thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nPollyanna began her story the next day. That is, she, with a very\r\nimportant air, got out a quantity of paper, sharpened up half-a-dozen\r\npencils, and established herself at the big old-fashioned Harrington\r\ndesk in the living-room. After biting restlessly at the ends of two of\r\nher pencils, she wrote down three words on the fair white page before\r\nher. Then she drew a long sigh, threw aside the second ruined pencil,\r\nand picked up a slender green one with a beautiful point. This point\r\nshe eyed with a meditative frown.\r\n\r\n"O dear! I wonder WHERE they get their titles," she despaired. "Maybe,\r\nthough, I ought to decide on the story first, and then make a title to\r\nfit. Anyhow, I\'M going to do it." And forthwith she drew a black line\r\nthrough the three words and poised the pencil for a fresh start.\r\n\r\nThe start was not made at once, however. Even when it was made, it\r\nmust have been a false one, for at the end of half an hour the whole\r\npage was nothing but a jumble of scratched-out lines, with only a few\r\nwords here and there left to tell the tale.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Aunt Polly came into the room. She turned tired eyes\r\nupon her niece.\r\n\r\n"Well, Pollyanna, what ARE you up to now?" she demanded.\r\n\r\nPollyanna laughed and colored guiltily.\r\n\r\n"Nothing much, auntie. Anyhow, it doesn\'t look as if it were\r\nmuch--yet," she admitted, with a rueful smile. "Besides, it\'s a\r\nsecret, and I\'m not going to tell it yet."\r\n\r\n"Very well; suit yourself," sighed Aunt Polly. "But I can tell you\r\nright now that if you\'re trying to make anything different out of\r\nthose mortgage papers Mr. Hart left, it\'s useless. I\'ve been all over\r\nthem myself twice."\r\n\r\n"No, dear, it isn\'t the papers. It\'s a whole heap nicer than any\r\npapers ever could be," crowed Pollyanna triumphantly, turning back to\r\nher work. In Pollyanna\'s eyes suddenly had risen a glowing vision of\r\nwhat it might be, with that three thousand dollars once hers.\r\n\r\nFor still another half-hour Pollyanna wrote and scratched, and chewed\r\nher pencils; then, with her courage dulled, but not destroyed, she\r\ngathered up her papers and pencils and left the room.\r\n\r\n"I reckon maybe I\'ll do better by myself up-stairs," she was thinking\r\nas she hurried through the hall. "I THOUGHT I ought to do it at a\r\ndesk--being literary work, so--but anyhow, the desk didn\'t help me any\r\nthis morning. I\'ll try the window seat in my room."\r\n\r\nThe window seat, however, proved to be no more inspiring, judging by\r\nthe scratched and re-scratched pages that fell from Pollyanna\'s hands;\r\nand at the end of another half-hour Pollyanna discovered suddenly that\r\nit was time to get dinner.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m glad \'tis, anyhow," she sighed to herself. "I\'d a lot\r\nrather get dinner than do this. Not but that I WANT to do this, of\r\ncourse; only I\'d no idea \'twas such an awful job--just a story, so!"\r\n\r\nDuring the following month Pollyanna worked faithfully, doggedly, but\r\nshe soon found that "just a story, so" was indeed no small matter to\r\naccomplish. Pollyanna, however, was not one to set her hand to the\r\nplow and look back. Besides, there was that three-thousand-dollar\r\nprize, or even any of the others, if she should not happen to win the\r\nfirst one! Of course even one hundred dollars was something! So day\r\nafter day she wrote and erased, and rewrote, until finally the story,\r\nsuch as it was, lay completed before her. Then, with some misgivings,\r\nit must be confessed, she took the manuscript to Milly Snow to be\r\ntypewritten.\r\n\r\n"It reads all right--that is, it makes sense," mused Pollyanna\r\ndoubtfully, as she hurried along toward the Snow cottage; "and it\'s a\r\nreal nice story about a perfectly lovely girl. But there\'s something\r\nsomewhere that isn\'t quite right about it, I\'m afraid. Anyhow, I don\'t\r\nbelieve I\'d better count too much on the first prize; then I won\'t be\r\ntoo much disappointed when I get one of the littler ones."\r\n\r\nPollyanna always thought of Jimmy when she went to the Snows\', for it\r\nwas at the side of the road near their cottage that she had first seen\r\nhim as a forlorn little runaway lad from the Orphans\' Home years\r\nbefore. She thought of him again to-day, with a little catch of her\r\nbreath. Then, with the proud lifting of her head that always came now\r\nwith the second thought of Jimmy, she hurried up the Snows\' doorsteps\r\nand rang the bell.\r\n\r\nAs was usually the case, the Snows had nothing but the warmest of\r\nwelcomes for Pollyanna; and also as usual it was not long before they\r\nwere talking of the game: in no home in Beldingsville was the glad\r\ngame more ardently played than in the Snows\'.\r\n\r\n"Well, and how are you getting along?" asked Pollyanna, when she had\r\nfinished the business part of her call.\r\n\r\n"Splendidly!" beamed Milly Snow. "This is the third job I\'ve got this\r\nweek. Oh, Miss Pollyanna, I\'m so glad you had me take up typewriting,\r\nfor you see I CAN do that right at home! And it\'s all owing to you."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" disclaimed Pollyanna, merrily.\r\n\r\n"But it is. In the first place, I couldn\'t have done it anyway if it\r\nhadn\'t been for the game--making mother so much better, you know, that\r\nI had some time to myself. And then, at the very first, you suggested\r\ntypewriting, and helped me to buy a machine. I should like to know if\r\nthat doesn\'t come pretty near owing it all to you!"\r\n\r\nBut once again Pollyanna objected. This time she was interrupted by\r\nMrs. Snow from her wheel chair by the window. And so earnestly and\r\ngravely did Mrs. Snow speak, that Pollyanna, in spite of herself,\r\ncould but hear what she had to say.\r\n\r\n"Listen, child, I don\'t think you know quite what you\'ve done. But I\r\nwish you could! There\'s a little look in your eyes, my dear, to-day,\r\nthat I don\'t like to see there. You are plagued and worried over\r\nsomething, I know. I can see it. And I don\'t wonder: your uncle\'s\r\ndeath, your aunt\'s condition, everything--I won\'t say more about that.\r\nBut there\'s something I do want to say, my dear, and you must let me\r\nsay it, for I can\'t bear to see that shadow in your eyes without\r\ntrying to drive it away by telling you what you\'ve done for me, for\r\nthis whole town, and for countless other people everywhere."\r\n\r\n"MRS. SNOW!" protested Pollyanna, in genuine distress.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I mean it, and I know what I\'m talking about," nodded the\r\ninvalid, triumphantly. "To begin with, look at me. Didn\'t you find me\r\na fretful, whining creature who never by any chance wanted what she\r\nhad until she found what she didn\'t have? And didn\'t you open my eyes\r\nby bringing me three kinds of things so I\'d HAVE to have what I\r\nwanted, for once?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mrs. Snow, was I really ever quite so--impertinent as that?"\r\nmurmured Pollyanna, with a painful blush.\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t impertinent," objected Mrs. Snow, stoutly. "You didn\'t MEAN\r\nit as impertinence--and that made all the difference in the world. You\r\ndidn\'t preach, either, my dear. If you had, you\'d never have got me to\r\nplaying the game, nor anybody else, I fancy. But you did get me to\r\nplaying it--and see what it\'s done for me, and for Milly! Here I am so\r\nmuch better that I can sit in a wheel chair and go anywhere on this\r\nfloor in it. That means a whole lot when it comes to waiting on\r\nyourself, and giving those around you a chance to breathe--meaning\r\nMilly, in this case. And the doctor says it\'s all owing to the game.\r\nThen there\'s others, quantities of others, right in this town, that\r\nI\'m hearing of all the time. Nellie Mahoney broke her wrist and was so\r\nglad it wasn\'t her leg that she didn\'t mind the wrist at all. Old Mrs.\r\nTibbits has lost her hearing, but she\'s so glad \'tisn\'t her eyesight\r\nthat she\'s actually happy. Do you remember cross-eyed Joe that they\r\nused to call Cross Joe, be cause of his temper? Nothing went to suit\r\nhim either, any more than it did me. Well, somebody\'s taught him the\r\ngame, they say, and made a different man of him. And listen, dear.\r\nIt\'s not only this town, but other places. I had a letter yesterday\r\nfrom my cousin in Massachusetts, and she told me all about Mrs. Tom\r\nPayson that used to live here. Do you remember them? They lived on the\r\nway up Pendleton Hill."\r\n\r\n"Yes, oh, yes, I remember them," cried Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"Well, they left here that winter you were in the Sanatorium and went\r\nto Massachusetts where my sister lives. She knows them well. She says\r\nMrs. Payson told her all about you, and how your glad game actually\r\nsaved them from a divorce. And now not only do they play it\r\nthemselves, but they\'ve got quite a lot of others playing it down\r\nthere, and THEY\'RE getting still others. So you see, dear, there\'s no\r\ntelling where that glad game of yours is going to stop. I wanted you\r\nto know. I thought it might help--even you to play the game sometimes;\r\nfor don\'t think I don\'t understand, dearie, that it IS hard for you to\r\nplay your own game--sometimes."\r\n\r\nPollyanna rose to her feet. She smiled, but her eyes glistened with\r\ntears, as she held out her hand in good-by.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Mrs. Snow," she said unsteadily. "It IS hard--sometimes;\r\nand maybe I DID need a little help about my own game. But, anyhow,\r\nnow--" her eyes flashed with their old merriment--"if any time I think\r\nI can\'t play the game myself I can remember that I can still always be\r\nGLAD there are some folks playing it!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna walked home a little soberly that afternoon. Touched as she\r\nwas by what Mrs. Snow had said, there was yet an undercurrent of\r\nsadness in it all. She was thinking of Aunt Polly--Aunt Polly who\r\nplayed the game now so seldom; and she was wondering if she herself\r\nalways played it, when she might.\r\n\r\n"Maybe I haven\'t been careful, always, to hunt up the glad side of the\r\nthings Aunt Polly says," she thought with undefined guiltiness; "and\r\nmaybe if I played the game better myself, Aunt Polly would play it--a\r\nlittle. Anyhow I\'m going to try. If I don\'t look out, all these other\r\npeople will be playing my own game better than I am myself!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nJOHN PENDLETON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just a week before Christmas that Pollyanna sent her story (now\r\nneatly typewritten) in for the contest. The prize-winners would not be\r\nannounced until April, the magazine notice said, so Pollyanna settled\r\nherself for the long wait with characteristic, philosophical patience.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, anyhow, but I\'m glad \'tis so long," she told herself,\r\n"for all winter I can have the fun of thinking it may be the first one\r\ninstead of one of the others, that I\'ll get. I might just as well\r\nthink I\'m going to get it, then if I do get it, I won\'t have been\r\nunhappy any. While if I don\'t get it--I won\'t have had all these weeks\r\nof unhappiness beforehand, anyway; and I can be glad for one of the\r\nsmaller ones, then." That she might not get any prize was not in\r\nPollyanna\'s calculations at all. The story, so beautifully typed by\r\nMilly Snow, looked almost as good as printed already--to Pollyanna.\r\n\r\nChristmas was not a happy time at the Harrington homestead that year,\r\nin spite of Pollyanna\'s strenuous efforts to make it so. Aunt Polly\r\nrefused absolutely to allow any sort of celebration of the day, and\r\nmade her attitude so unmistakably plain that Pollyanna could not give\r\neven the simplest of presents.\r\n\r\nChristmas evening John Pendleton called. Mrs. Chilton excused herself,\r\nbut Pollyanna, utterly worn out from a long day with her aunt,\r\nwelcomed him joyously. But even here she found a fly in the amber of\r\nher content; for John Pendleton had brought with him a letter from\r\nJimmy, and the letter was full of nothing but the plans he and Mrs.\r\nCarew were making for a wonderful Christmas celebration at the Home\r\nfor Working Girls: and Pollyanna, ashamed though she was to own it to\r\nherself, was not in a mood to hear about Christmas celebrations just\r\nthen--least of all, Jimmy\'s.\r\n\r\nJohn Pendleton, however, was not ready to let the subject drop, even\r\nwhen the letter had been read.\r\n\r\n"Great doings--those!" he exclaimed, as he folded the letter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed; fine!" murmured Pollyanna, trying to speak with due\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"And it\'s to-night, too, isn\'t it? I\'d like to drop in on them about\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Yes," murmured Pollyanna again, with still more careful enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Carew knew what she was about when she got Jimmy to help her, I\r\nfancy," chuckled the man. "But I\'m wondering how Jimmy likes\r\nit--playing Santa Claus to half a hundred young women at once!"\r\n\r\n"Why, he finds it delightful, of course!" Pollyanna lifted her chin\r\never so slightly.\r\n\r\n"Maybe. Still, it\'s a little different from learning to build bridges,\r\nyou must confess."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ll risk Jimmy, and I\'ll risk wagering that those girls never\r\nhad a better time than he\'ll give them to-night, too."\r\n\r\n"Y-yes, of course," stammered Pollyanna, trying to keep the hated\r\ntremulousness out of her voice, and trying very hard NOT to compare\r\nher own dreary evening in Beldingsville with nobody but John Pendleton\r\nto that of those fifty girls in Boston--with Jimmy.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief pause, during which John Pendleton gazed dreamily at\r\nthe dancing fire on the hearth.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a wonderful woman--Mrs. Carew is," he said at last.\r\n\r\n"She is, indeed!" This time the enthusiasm in Pollyanna\'s voice was\r\nall pure gold.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy\'s written me before something of what she\'s done for those\r\ngirls," went on the man, still gazing into the fire. "In just the last\r\nletter before this he wrote a lot about it, and about her. He said he\r\nalways admired her, but never so much as now, when he can see what she\r\nreally is."\r\n\r\n"She\'s a dear--that\'s what Mrs. Carew is," declared Pollyanna, warmly.\r\n"She\'s a dear in every way, and I love her."\r\n\r\nJohn Pendleton stirred suddenly. He turned to Pollyanna with an oddly\r\nwhimsical look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I know you do, my dear. For that matter, there may be others,\r\ntoo--that love her."\r\n\r\nPollyanna\'s heart skipped a beat. A sudden thought came to her with\r\nstunning, blinding force. JIMMY! Could John Pendleton be meaning that\r\nJimmy cared THAT WAY--for Mrs. Carew?\r\n\r\n"You mean--?" she faltered. She could not finish.\r\n\r\nWith a nervous twitch peculiar to him, John Pendleton got to his feet.\r\n\r\n"I mean--the girls, of course," he answered lightly, still with that\r\nwhimsical smile. "Don\'t you suppose those fifty girls--love her \'most\r\nto death?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna said "yes, of course," and murmured something else\r\nappropriate, in answer to John Pendleton\'s next remark. But her\r\nthoughts were in a tumult, and she let the man do most of the talking\r\nfor the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\nNor did John Pendleton seem averse to this. Restlessly he took a turn\r\nor two about the room, then sat down in his old place. And when he\r\nspoke, it was on his old subject, Mrs. Carew.\r\n\r\n"Queer--about that Jamie of hers, isn\'t it? I wonder if he IS her\r\nnephew."\r\n\r\nAs Pollyanna did not answer, the man went on, after a moment\'s\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a fine fellow, anyway. I like him. There\'s something fine and\r\ngenuine about him. She\'s bound up in him. That\'s plain to be seen,\r\nwhether he\'s really her kin or not."\r\n\r\nThere was--another pause, then, in a slightly altered voice, John\r\nPendleton said:\r\n\r\n"Still it\'s queer, too, when you come to think of it, that she\r\nnever--married again. She is certainly now--a very beautiful woman.\r\nDon\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes, indeed she is," plunged in Pollyanna, with precipitate\r\nhaste; "a--a very beautiful woman."\r\n\r\nThere was a little break at the last in Pollyanna\'s voice. Pollyanna,\r\njust then, had caught sight of her own face in the mirror\r\nopposite--and Pollyanna to herself was never "a very beautiful woman."\r\n\r\nOn and on rambled John Pendleton, musingly, contentedly, his eyes on\r\nthe fire. Whether he was answered or not seemed not to disturb him.\r\nWhether he was even listened to or not, he seemed hardly to know. He\r\nwanted, apparently, only to talk; but at last he got to his feet\r\nreluctantly and said good-night.\r\n\r\nFor a weary half-hour Pollyanna had been longing for him to go, that\r\nshe might be alone; but after he had gone she wished he were back. She\r\nhad found suddenly that she did not want to be alone--with her\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderfully clear to Pollyanna now. There was no doubt of it.\r\nJimmy cared for Mrs. Carew. That was why he was so moody and restless\r\nafter she left. That was why he had come so seldom to see her,\r\nPollyanna, his old friend. That was why--\r\n\r\nCountless little circumstances of the past summer flocked to\r\nPollyanna\'s memory now, mute witnesses that would not be denied.\r\n\r\nAnd why should he not care for her? Mrs. Carew was certainly beautiful\r\nand charming. True, she was older than Jimmy; but young men had\r\nmarried women far older than she, many times. And if they loved each\r\nother--\r\n\r\nPollyanna cried herself to sleep that night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, bravely she tried to face the thing. She even tried,\r\nwith a tearful smile, to put it to the test of the glad game. She was\r\nreminded then of something Nancy had said to her years before: "If\r\nthere IS a set o\' folks in the world that wouldn\'t have no use for\r\nthat \'ere glad game o\' your\'n, it\'d be a pair o\' quarrellin\' lovers!"\r\n\r\n"Not that we\'re \'quarrelling,\' or even \'lovers,\'" thought Pollyanna\r\nblushingly; "but just the same I can be glad HE\'S glad, and glad SHE\'S\r\nglad, too, only--" Even to herself Pollyanna could not finish this\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nBeing so sure now that Jimmy and Mrs. Carew cared for each other,\r\nPollyanna became peculiarly sensitive to everything that tended to\r\nstrengthen that belief. And being ever on the watch for it, she found\r\nit, as was to be expected. First in Mrs. Carew\'s letters.\r\n\r\n"I am seeing a lot of your friend, young Pendleton," Mrs. Carew wrote\r\none day; "and I\'m liking him more and more. I do wish, however--just\r\nfor curiosity\'s sake--that I could trace to its source that elusive\r\nfeeling that I\'ve seen him before somewhere."\r\n\r\nFrequently, after this, she mentioned him casually; and, to Pollyanna,\r\nin the very casualness of these references lay their sharpest sting;\r\nfor it showed so unmistakably that Jimmy and Jimmy\'s presence were now\r\nto Mrs. Carew a matter of course. From other sources, too, Pollyanna\r\nfound fuel for the fire of her suspicions. More and more frequently\r\nJohn Pendleton "dropped in" with his stories of Jimmy, and of what\r\nJimmy was doing; and always here there was mention of Mrs. Carew. Poor\r\nPollyanna wondered, indeed, sometimes, if John Pendleton could not\r\ntalk of anything--but Mrs. Carew and Jimmy, so constantly was one or\r\nthe other of those names on his lips.\r\n\r\nThere were Sadie Dean\'s letters, too, and they told of Jimmy, and of\r\nwhat he was doing to help Mrs. Carew. Even Jamie, who wrote\r\noccasionally, had his mite to add, for he wrote one evening:\r\n\r\n"It\'s ten o\'clock. I\'m sitting here alone waiting for Mrs. Carew to\r\ncome home. She and Pendleton have been to one of their usual socials\r\ndown to the Home."\r\n\r\nFrom Jimmy himself Pollyanna heard very rarely; and for that she told\r\nherself mournfully that she COULD be GLAD.\r\n\r\n"For if he can\'t write about ANYTHING but Mrs. Carew and those girls,\r\nI\'m glad he doesn\'t write very often!" she sighed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE DAY POLLYANNA DID NOT PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so one by one the winter days passed. January and February slipped\r\naway in snow and sleet, and March came in with a gale that whistled\r\nand moaned around the old house, and set loose blinds to swinging and\r\nloose gates to creaking in a way that was most trying to nerves\r\nalready stretched to the breaking point.\r\n\r\nPollyanna was not finding it very easy these days to play the game,\r\nbut she was playing it faithfully, valiantly. Aunt Polly was not\r\nplaying it at all--which certainly did not make it any the easier for\r\nPollyanna to play it. Aunt Polly was blue and discouraged. She was not\r\nwell, too, and she had plainly abandoned herself to utter gloom.\r\n\r\nPollyanna still was counting on the prize contest. She had dropped\r\nfrom the first prize to one of the smaller ones, however: Pollyanna\r\nhad been writing more stories, and the regularity with which they came\r\nback from their pilgrimages to magazine editors was beginning to shake\r\nher faith in her success as an author.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I can be glad that Aunt Polly doesn\'t know anything about\r\nit, anyway," declared Pollyanna to herself bravely, as she twisted in\r\nher fingers the "declined-with-thanks" slip that had just towed in one\r\nmore shipwrecked story. "She CAN\'T worry about this--she doesn\'t know\r\nabout it!"\r\n\r\nAll of Pollyanna\'s life these days revolved around Aunt Polly, and it\r\nis doubtful if even Aunt Polly herself realized how exacting she had\r\nbecome, and how entirely her niece was giving up her life to her.\r\n\r\nIt was on a particularly gloomy day in March that matters came, in a\r\nway, to a climax. Pollyanna, upon arising, had looked at the sky with\r\na sigh--Aunt Polly was always more difficult on cloudy days. With a\r\ngay little song, however, that still sounded a bit forced--Pollyanna\r\ndescended to the kitchen and began to prepare breakfast.\r\n\r\n"I reckon I\'ll make corn muffins," she told the stove confidentially;\r\n"then maybe Aunt Polly won\'t mind--other things so much."\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later she tapped at her aunt\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Up so soon? Oh, that\'s fine! And you\'ve done your hair yourself!"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t sleep. I had to get up," sighed Aunt Polly, wearily. "I\r\nhad to do my hair, too. YOU weren\'t here."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t suppose you were ready for me, auntie," explained\r\nPollyanna, hurriedly. "Never mind, though. You\'ll be glad I wasn\'t\r\nwhen you find what I\'ve been doing."\r\n\r\n"Well, I sha\'n\'t--not this morning," frowned Aunt Polly, perversely.\r\n"Nobody could be glad this morning. Look at it rain! That makes the\r\nthird rainy day this week."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so--but you know the sun never seems quite so perfectly lovely\r\nas it does after a lot of rain like this," smiled Pollyanna, deftly\r\narranging a bit of lace and ribbon at her aunt\'s throat. "Now come.\r\nBreakfast\'s all ready. Just you wait till you see what I\'ve got for\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nAunt Polly, however, was not to be diverted, even by corn muffins,\r\nthis morning. Nothing was right, nothing was even endurable, as she\r\nfelt; and Pollyanna\'s patience was sorely taxed before the meal was\r\nover. To make matters worse, the roof over the east attic window was\r\nfound to be leaking, and an unpleasant letter came in the mail.\r\nPollyanna, true to her creed, laughingly declared that, for her part,\r\nshe was glad they had a roof--to leak; and that, as for the letter,\r\nshe\'d been expecting it for a week, anyway, and she was actually glad\r\nshe wouldn\'t have to worry any more for fear it would come. It\r\nCOULDN\'T come now, because it HAD come; and \'twas over with.\r\n\r\nAll this, together with sundry other hindrances and annoyances,\r\ndelayed the usual morning work until far into the afternoon--something\r\nthat was always particularly displeasing to methodical Aunt Polly, who\r\nordered her own life, preferably, by the tick of the clock.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s half-past three, Pollyanna, already! Did you know it?" she\r\nfretted at last. "And you haven\'t made the beds yet."\r\n\r\n"No, dearie, but I will. Don\'t worry."\r\n\r\n"But, did you hear what I said? Look at the clock, child. It\'s after\r\nthree o\'clock!"\r\n\r\n"So \'tis, but never mind, Aunt Polly. We can be glad \'tisn\'t after\r\nfour."\r\n\r\nAunt Polly sniffed her disdain.\r\n\r\n"I suppose YOU can," she observed tartly.\r\n\r\nPollyanna laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, auntie, clocks ARE accommodating things, when you stop\r\nto think about it. I found that out long ago at the Sanatorium. When I\r\nwas doing something that I liked, and I didn\'t WANT the time to go\r\nfast, I\'d just look at the hour hand, and I\'d feel as if I had lots of\r\ntime--it went so slow. Then, other days, when I had to keep something\r\nthat hurt on for an hour, maybe, I\'d watch the little second hand; and\r\nyou see then I felt as if Old Time was just humping himself to help me\r\nout by going as fast as ever he could. Now I\'m watching the hour hand\r\nto-day, \'cause I don\'t want Time to go fast. See?" she twinkled\r\nmischievously, as she hurried from the room, before Aunt Polly had\r\ntime to answer.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a hard day, and by night Pollyanna looked pale and\r\nworn out. This, too, was a source of worriment to Aunt Polly.\r\n\r\n"Dear me, child, you look tired to death!" she fumed. "WHAT we\'re\r\ngoing to do I don\'t know. I suppose YOU\'LL be sick next!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, auntie! I\'m not sick a bit," declared Pollyanna, dropping\r\nherself with a sigh on to the couch. "But I AM tired. My! how good\r\nthis couch feels! I\'m glad I\'m tired, after all--it\'s so nice to\r\nrest."\r\n\r\nAunt Polly turned with an impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n"Glad--glad--glad! Of course you\'re glad, Pollyanna. You\'re always\r\nglad for everything. I never saw such a girl. Oh, yes, I know it\'s the\r\ngame," she went on, in answer to the look that came to Pollyanna\'s\r\nface. "And it\'s a very good game, too; but I think you carry it\r\naltogether too far. This eternal doctrine of \'it might be worse\' has\r\ngot on my nerves, Pollyanna. Honestly, it would be a real relief if\r\nyou WOULDN\'T be glad for something, sometime!"\r\n\r\n"Why, auntie!" Pollyanna pulled herself half erect.\r\n\r\n"Well, it would. You just try it sometime, and see."\r\n\r\n"But, auntie, I--" Pollyanna stopped and eyed her aunt reflectively.\r\nAn odd look came to her eyes; a slow smile curved her lips. Mrs.\r\nChilton, who had turned back to her work, paid no heed; and, after a\r\nminute, Pollyanna lay back on the couch without finishing her\r\nsentence, the curious smile still on her lips.\r\n\r\nIt was raining again when Pollyanna got up the next morning, and a\r\nnortheast wind was still whistling down the chimney. Pollyanna at the\r\nwindow drew an involuntary sigh; but almost at once her face changed.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I\'m glad--" She clapped her hands to her lips. "Dear me,"\r\nshe chuckled softly, her eyes dancing, "I shall forget--I know I\r\nshall; and that\'ll spoil it all! I must just remember not to be glad\r\nfor anything--not ANYTHING to-day."\r\n\r\nPollyanna did not make corn muffins that morning. She started the\r\nbreakfast, then went to her aunt\'s room.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chilton was still in bed.\r\n\r\n"I see it rains, as usual," she observed, by way of greeting.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it\'s horrid--perfectly horrid," scolded Pollyanna. "It\'s rained\r\n\'most every day this week, too. I hate such weather."\r\n\r\nAunt Polly turned with a faint surprise in her eyes; but Pollyanna was\r\nlooking the other way.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to get up now?" she asked a little wearily.\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes," murmured Aunt Polly, still with that faint surprise in\r\nher eyes. "What\'s the matter, Pollyanna? Are you especially tired?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am tired this morning. I didn\'t sleep well, either. I hate not\r\nto sleep. Things always plague so in the night, when you wake up."\r\n\r\n"I guess I know that," fretted Aunt Polly. "I didn\'t sleep a wink\r\nafter two o\'clock myself. And there\'s that roof! How are we going to\r\nhave it fixed, pray, if it never stops raining? Have you been up to\r\nempty the pans?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes--and took up some more. There\'s a new leak now, further\r\nover."\r\n\r\n"A new one! Why, it\'ll all be leaking yet!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna opened her lips. She had almost said, "Well, we can be glad\r\nto have it fixed all at once, then," when she suddenly remembered, and\r\nsubstituted, in a tired voice:\r\n\r\n"Very likely it will, auntie. It looks like it now, fast enough.\r\nAnyway, it\'s made fuss enough for a whole roof already, and I\'m sick\r\nof it!" With which statement, Pollyanna, her face carefully averted,\r\nturned and trailed listlessly out of the room.\r\n\r\n"It\'s so funny and so--so hard, I\'m afraid I\'m making a mess of it,"\r\nshe whispered to herself anxiously, as she hurried down-stairs to the\r\nkitchen.\r\n\r\nBehind her, Aunt Polly, in the bedroom, gazed after her with eyes that\r\nwere again faintly puzzled.\r\n\r\nAunt Polly had occasion a good many times before six o\'clock that\r\nnight to gaze at Pollyanna with surprised and questioning eyes.\r\nNothing was right with Pollyanna. The fire would not burn, the wind\r\nblew one particular blind loose three times, and still a third leak\r\nwas discovered in the roof. The mail brought to Pollyanna a letter\r\nthat made her cry (though no amount of questioning on Aunt Polly\'s\r\npart would persuade her to tell why). Even the dinner went wrong, and\r\ninnumerable things happened in the afternoon to call out fretful,\r\ndiscouraged remarks.\r\n\r\nNot until the day was more than half gone did a look of shrewd\r\nsuspicion suddenly fight for supremacy with the puzzled questioning in\r\nAunt Polly\'s eyes. If Pollyanna saw this she made no sign. Certainly\r\nthere was no abatement in her fretfulness and discontent. Long before\r\nsix o\'clock, however, the suspicion in Aunt Polly\'s eyes became\r\nconviction, and drove to ignominious defeat the puzzled questioning.\r\nBut, curiously enough then, a new look came to take its place, a look\r\nthat was actually a twinkle of amusement.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a particularly doleful complaint on Pollyanna\'s part,\r\nAunt Polly threw up her hands with a gesture of half-laughing despair.\r\n\r\n"That\'ll do, that\'ll do, child! I\'ll give up. I\'ll confess myself\r\nbeaten at my own game. You can be--GLAD for that, if you like," she\r\nfinished with a grim smile.\r\n\r\n"I know, auntie, but you said--" began Pollyanna demurely.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, but I never will again," interrupted Aunt Polly, with\r\nemphasis. "Mercy, what a day this has been! I never want to live\r\nthrough another like it." She hesitated, flushed a little, then went\r\non with evident difficulty: "Furthermore, I--I want you to know\r\nthat--that I understand I haven\'t played the game myself--very well,\r\nlately; but, after this, I\'m going to--to try--WHERE\'S my\r\nhandkerchief?" she finished sharply, fumbling in the folds of her\r\ndress.\r\n\r\nPollyanna sprang to her feet and crossed instantly to her aunt\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Aunt Polly, I didn\'t mean--It was just a--a joke," she\r\nquavered in quick distress. "I never thought of your taking it THAT\r\nway."\r\n\r\n"Of course you didn\'t," snapped Aunt Polly, with all the asperity of a\r\nstern, repressed woman who abhors scenes and sentiment, and who is\r\nmortally afraid she will show that her heart has been touched. "Don\'t\r\nyou suppose I know you didn\'t mean it that way? Do you think, if I\r\nthought you HAD been trying to teach me a lesson that I\'d--I\'d--" But\r\nPollyanna\'s strong young arms had her in a close embrace, and she\r\ncould not finish the sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nJIMMY AND JAMIE\r\n\r\n\r\nPollyanna was not the only one that was finding that winter a hard\r\none. In Boston Jimmy Pendleton, in spite of his strenuous efforts to\r\noccupy his time and thoughts, was discovering that nothing quite\r\nerased from his vision a certain pair of laughing blue eyes, and\r\nnothing quite obliterated from his memory a certain well-loved, merry\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nJimmy told himself that if it were not for Mrs. Carew, and the fact\r\nthat he could be of some use to her, life would not be worth the\r\nliving. Even at Mrs. Carew\'s it was not all joy, for always there was\r\nJamie; and Jamie brought thoughts of Pollyanna--unhappy thoughts.\r\n\r\nBeing thoroughly convinced that Jamie and Pollyanna cared for each\r\nother, and also being equally convinced that he himself was in honor\r\nbound to step one side and give the handicapped Jamie full right of\r\nway, it never occurred to him to question further. Of Pollyanna he did\r\nnot like to talk or to hear. He knew that both Jamie and Mrs. Carew\r\nheard from her; and when they spoke of her, he forced himself to\r\nlisten, in spite of his heartache. But he always changed the subject\r\nas soon as possible, and he limited his own letters to her to the\r\nbriefest and most infrequent epistles possible. For, to Jimmy, a\r\nPollyanna that was not his was nothing but a source of pain and\r\nwretchedness; and he had been so glad when the time came for him to\r\nleave Beldingsville and take up his studies again in Boston: to be so\r\nnear Pollyanna, and yet so far from her, he had found to be nothing\r\nbut torture.\r\n\r\nIn Boston, with all the feverishness of a restless mind that seeks\r\ndistraction from itself, he had thrown himself into the carrying out\r\nof Mrs. Carew\'s plans for her beloved working girls, and such time as\r\ncould be spared from his own duties he had devoted to this work, much\r\nto Mrs. Carew\'s delight and gratitude.\r\n\r\nAnd so for Jimmy the winter had passed and spring had come--a joyous,\r\nblossoming spring full of soft breezes, gentle showers, and tender\r\ngreen buds expanding into riotous bloom and fragrance. To Jimmy,\r\nhowever, it was anything but a joyous spring, for in his heart was\r\nstill nothing but a gloomy winter of discontent.\r\n\r\n"If only they\'d settle things and announce the engagement, once for\r\nall," murmured Jimmy to himself, more and more frequently these days.\r\n"If only I could know SOMETHING for sure, I think I could stand it\r\nbetter!"\r\n\r\nThen one day late in April, he had his wish--a part of it: he learned\r\n"something for sure."\r\n\r\nIt was ten o\'clock on a Saturday morning, and Mary, at Mrs. Carew\'s,\r\nhad ushered him into the music-room with a well-trained: "I\'ll tell\r\nMrs. Carew you\'re here, sir. She\'s expecting you, I think."\r\n\r\nIn the music-room Jimmy had found himself brought to a dismayed halt\r\nby the sight of Jamie at the piano, his arms outflung upon the rack,\r\nand his head bowed upon them. Pendleton had half turned to beat a soft\r\nretreat when the man at the piano lifted his head, bringing into view\r\ntwo flushed cheeks and a pair of fever-bright eyes.\r\n\r\n"Why, Carew," stammered Pendleton, aghast, "has\r\nanything--er--happened?"\r\n\r\n"Happened! Happened!" ejaculated the lame youth, flinging out both his\r\nhands, in each of which, as Pendleton now saw, was an open letter.\r\n"Everything has happened! Wouldn\'t you think it had if all your life\r\nyou\'d been in prison, and suddenly you saw the gates flung wide open?\r\nWouldn\'t you think it had if all in a minute you could ask the girl\r\nyou loved to be your wife? Wouldn\'t you think it had if--But, listen!\r\nYou think I\'m crazy, but I\'m not. Though maybe I am, after all, crazy\r\nwith joy. I\'d like to tell you. May I? I\'ve got to tell somebody!"\r\n\r\nPendleton lifted his head. It was as if, unconsciously, he was bracing\r\nhimself for a blow. He had grown a little white; but his voice was\r\nquite steady when he answered.\r\n\r\n"Sure you may, old fellow. I\'d be--glad to hear it."\r\n\r\nCarew, however, had scarcely waited for assent. He was rushing on,\r\nstill a bit incoherently.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not much to you, of course. You have two feet and your freedom.\r\nYou have your ambitions and your bridges. But I--to me it\'s\r\neverything. It\'s a chance to live a man\'s life and do a man\'s work,\r\nperhaps--even if it isn\'t dams and bridges. It\'s something!--and it\'s\r\nsomething I\'ve proved now I CAN DO! Listen. In that letter there is\r\nthe announcement that a little story of mine has won the first\r\nprize--$3,000, in a contest. In that other letter there, a big\r\npublishing house accepts with flattering enthusiasm my first book\r\nmanuscript for publication. And they both came to-day--this morning.\r\nDo you wonder I am crazy glad?"\r\n\r\n"No! No, indeed! I congratulate you, Carew, with all my heart," cried\r\nJimmy, warmly.\r\n\r\n"Thank you--and you may congratulate me. Think what it means to me.\r\nThink what it means if, by and by, I can be independent, like a man.\r\nThink what it means if I can, some day, make Mrs. Carew proud and glad\r\nthat she gave the crippled lad a place in her home and heart. Think\r\nwhat it means for me to be able to tell the girl I love that I DO love\r\nher."\r\n\r\n"Yes--yes, indeed, old boy!" Jimmy spoke firmly, though he had grown\r\nvery white now.\r\n\r\n"Of course, maybe I ought not to do that last, even now," resumed\r\nJamie, a swift cloud shadowing the shining brightness of his\r\ncountenance. "I\'m still tied to--these." He tapped the crutches by his\r\nside. "I can\'t forget, of course, that day in the woods last summer,\r\nwhen I saw Pollyanna--I realize that always I\'ll have to run the\r\nchance of seeing the girl I love in danger, and not being able to\r\nrescue her."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Carew--" began the other huskily.\r\n\r\nCarew lifted a peremptory hand.\r\n\r\n"I know what you\'d say. But don\'t say it. You can\'t understand. YOU\r\naren\'t tied to two sticks. You did the rescuing, not I. It came to me\r\nthen how it would be, always, with me and--Sadie. I\'d have to stand\r\naside and see others--"\r\n\r\n"SADIE!" cut in Jimmy, sharply.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Sadie Dean. You act surprised. Didn\'t you know? Haven\'t you\r\nsuspected--how I felt toward Sadie?" cried Jamie. "Have I kept it so\r\nwell to myself, then? I tried to, but--" He finished with a faint\r\nsmile and a half-despairing gesture.\r\n\r\n"Well, you certainly kept it all right, old fellow--from me, anyhow,"\r\ncried Jimmy, gayly. The color had come back to Jimmy\'s face in a rich\r\nflood, and his eyes had grown suddenly very bright indeed. "So it\'s\r\nSadie Dean. Good! I congratulate you again, I do, I do, as Nancy\r\nsays." Jimmy was quite babbling with joy and excitement now, so great\r\nand wonderful had been the reaction within him at the discovery that\r\nit was Sadie, not Pollyanna, whom Jamie loved. Jamie flushed and shook\r\nhis head a bit sadly.\r\n\r\n"No congratulations--yet. You see, I haven\'t spoken to--her. But I\r\nthink she must know. I supposed everybody knew. Pray, whom did you\r\nthink it was, if not--Sadie?"\r\n\r\nJimmy hesitated. Then, a little precipitately, he let it out.\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'d thought of--Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nJamie smiled and pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna\'s a charming girl, and I love her--but not that way, any\r\nmore than she does me. Besides, I fancy somebody else would have\r\nsomething to say about that; eh?"\r\n\r\nJimmy colored like a happy, conscious boy.\r\n\r\n"Do you?" he challenged, trying to make his voice properly impersonal.\r\n\r\n"Of course! John Pendleton."\r\n\r\n"JOHN PENDLETON!" Jimmy wheeled sharply.\r\n\r\n"What about John Pendleton?" queried a new voice; and Mrs. Carew came\r\nforward with a smile.\r\n\r\nJimmy, around whose ears for the second time within five minutes the\r\nworld had crashed into fragments, barely collected himself enough for\r\na low word of greeting. But Jamie, unabashed, turned with a triumphant\r\nair of assurance.\r\n\r\n"Nothing; only I just said that I believed John Pendleton would have\r\nsomething to say about Pollyanna\'s loving anybody--but him."\r\n\r\n"POLLYANNA! JOHN PENDLETON!" Mrs. Carew sat down suddenly in the chair\r\nnearest her. If the two men before her had not been so deeply absorbed\r\nin their own affairs they might have noticed that the smile had\r\nvanished from Mrs. Carew\'s lips, and that an odd look as of almost\r\nfear had come to her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," maintained Jamie. "Were you both blind last summer?\r\nWasn\'t he with her a lot?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought he was with--all of us," murmured Mrs. Carew, a little\r\nfaintly.\r\n\r\n"Not as he was with Pollyanna," insisted Jamie. "Besides, have you\r\nforgotten that day when we were talking about John Pendleton\'s\r\nmarrying, and Pollyanna blushed and stammered and said finally that he\r\nHAD thought of marrying--once. Well, I wondered then if there wasn\'t\r\nSOMETHING between them. Don\'t you remember?"\r\n\r\n"Y-yes, I think I do--now that you speak of it," murmured Mrs. Carew\r\nagain. "But I had--forgotten it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I can explain that," cut in Jimmy, wetting his dry lips.\r\n"John Pendleton DID have a love affair once, but it was with\r\nPollyanna\'s mother."\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna\'s mother!" exclaimed two voices in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He loved her years ago, but she did not care for him at all, I\r\nunderstand. She had another lover--a minister, and she married him\r\ninstead--Pollyanna\'s father."\r\n\r\n"Oh-h!" breathed Mrs. Carew, leaning forward suddenly in her chair.\r\n"And is that why he\'s--never married?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," avouched Jimmy. "So you see there\'s really nothing to that idea\r\nat all--that he cares for Pollyanna. It was her mother."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary I think it makes a whole lot to that idea," declared\r\nJamie, wagging his head wisely. "I think it makes my case all the\r\nstronger. Listen. He once loved the mother. He couldn\'t have her. What\r\nmore absolutely natural than that he should love the daughter now--and\r\nwin her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jamie, you incorrigible spinner of tales!" reproached Mrs. Carew,\r\nwith a nervous laugh. "This is no ten-penny novel. It\'s real life.\r\nShe\'s too young for him. He ought to marry a woman, not a girl--that\r\nis, if he marries any one, I mean," she stammeringly corrected, a\r\nsudden flood of color in her face.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps; but what if it happens to be a GIRL that he loves?" argued\r\nJamie, stubbornly. "And, really, just stop to think. Have we had a\r\nsingle letter from her that hasn\'t told of his being there? And you\r\nKNOW how HE\'S always talking of Pollyanna in his letters."\r\n\r\nMrs. Carew got suddenly to her feet.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know," she murmured, with an odd little gesture, as if\r\nthrowing something distasteful aside. "But--" She did not finish her\r\nsentence, and a moment later she had left the room.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back in five minutes she found, much to her surprise,\r\nthat Jimmy had gone.\r\n\r\n"Why, I thought he was going with us on the girls\' picnic!" she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n"So did I," frowned Jamie. "But the first thing I knew he was\r\nexplaining or apologizing or something about unexpectedly having to\r\nleave town, and he\'d come to tell you he couldn\'t go with us. Anyhow,\r\nthe next thing I knew he\'d gone. You see,"--Jamie\'s eyes were glowing\r\nagain--"I don\'t think I knew quite what he did say, anyway. I had\r\nsomething else to think of." And he jubilantly spread before her the\r\ntwo letters which all the time he had still kept in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jamie!" breathed Mrs. Carew, when she had read the letters\r\nthrough. "How proud I am of you!" Then suddenly her eyes filled with\r\ntears at the look of ineffable joy that illumined Jamie\'s face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nJIMMY AND JOHN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a very determined, square-jawed young man that alighted at the\r\nBeldingsville station late that Saturday night. And it was an even\r\nmore determined, square-jawed young man that, before ten o\'clock the\r\nnext morning, stalked through the Sunday-quiet village streets and\r\nclimbed the hill to the Harrington homestead. Catching sight of a\r\nloved and familiar flaxen coil of hair on a well-poised little head\r\njust disappearing into the summerhouse, the young man ignored the\r\nconventional front steps and doorbell, crossed the lawn, and strode\r\nthrough the garden paths until he came face to face with the owner of\r\nthe flaxen coil of hair.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy!" gasped Pollyanna, falling back with startled eyes. "Why,\r\nwhere did you--come from?"\r\n\r\n"Boston. Last night. I had to see you, Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"To--see--m-me?" Pollyanna was plainly fencing for time to regain her\r\ncomposure. Jimmy looked so big and strong and DEAR there in the door\r\nof the summerhouse that she feared her eyes had been surprised into a\r\ntelltale admiration, if not more.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Pollyanna; I wanted--that is, I thought--I mean, I feared--Oh,\r\nhang it all, Pollyanna, I can\'t beat about the bush like this. I\'ll\r\nhave to come straight to the point. It\'s just this. I stood aside\r\nbefore, but I won\'t now. It isn\'t a case any longer of fairness. He\r\nisn\'t crippled like Jamie. He\'s got feet and hands and a head like\r\nmine, and if he wins he\'ll have to win in a fair fight. I\'VE got some\r\nrights!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna stared frankly.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy Bean Pendleton, whatever in the world are you talking about?"\r\nshe demanded.\r\n\r\nThe young man laughed shamefacedly.\r\n\r\n"No wonder you don\'t know. It wasn\'t very lucid, was it? But I don\'t\r\nthink I\'ve been really lucid myself since yesterday--when I found out\r\nfrom Jamie himself."\r\n\r\n"Found out--from Jamie!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It was the prize that started it. You see, he\'d just got one,\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know about that," interrupted Pollyanna, eagerly. "And wasn\'t\r\nit splendid? Just think--the first one--three thousand dollars! I\r\nwrote him a letter last night. Why, when I saw his name, and realized\r\nit was Jamie--OUR JAMIE--I was so excited I forgot all about looking\r\nfor MY name, and even when I couldn\'t find mine at all, and knew that\r\nI hadn\'t got any--I mean, I was so excited and pleased for Jamie that\r\nI--I forgot--er--everything else," corrected Pollyanna, throwing a\r\ndismayed glance into Jimmy\'s face, and feverishly trying to cover up\r\nthe partial admission she had made.\r\n\r\nJimmy, however, was too intent on his own problem to notice hers.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, \'twas fine, of course. I\'m glad he got it. But Pollyanna,\r\nit was what he said AFTERWARD that I mean. You see, until then I\'d\r\nthought that--that he cared--that you cared--for each other, I mean;\r\nand--"\r\n\r\n"You thought that Jamie and I cared for each other!" exclaimed\r\nPollyanna, into whose face now was stealing a soft, shy color. "Why,\r\nJimmy, it\'s Sadie Dean. \'Twas always Sadie Dean. He used to talk of\r\nher to me by the hour. I think she likes him, too."\r\n\r\n"Good! I hope she does; but, you see, I didn\'t know. I thought \'twas\r\nJamie--and you. And I thought that because he was--was a cripple, you\r\nknow, that it wouldn\'t be fair if I--if I stayed around and tried to\r\nwin you myself."\r\n\r\nPollyanna stooped suddenly, and picked up a leaf at her feet. When she\r\nrose, her face was turned quite away.\r\n\r\n"A fellow can\'t--can\'t feel square, you know, running a race with a\r\nchap that--that\'s handicapped from the start. So I--I just stayed away\r\nand gave him his chance; though it \'most broke my heart to do it,\r\nlittle girl. It just did! Then yesterday morning I found out. But I\r\nfound out something else, too. Jamie says there is--is somebody else\r\nin the case. But I can\'t stand aside for him, Pollyanna. I can\'t--even\r\nin spite of all he\'s done for me. John Pendleton is a man, and he\'s\r\ngot two whole feet for the race. He\'s got to take his chances. If you\r\ncare for him--if you really care for him--"\r\n\r\nBut Pollyanna had turned, wild-eyed.\r\n\r\n"JOHN PENDLETON! Jimmy, what do you mean? What are you saying--about\r\nJohn Pendleton?"\r\n\r\nA great joy transfigured Jimmy\'s face. He held out both his hands.\r\n\r\n"Then you don\'t--you don\'t! I can see it in your eyes that you\r\ndon\'t--care!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna shrank back. She was white and trembling.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy, what do you mean? What do you mean?" she begged piteously.\r\n\r\n"I mean--you don\'t care for Uncle John, that way. Don\'t you\r\nunderstand? Jamie thinks you do care, and that anyway he cares for\r\nyou. And then I began to see it--that maybe he did. He\'s always\r\ntalking about you; and, of course, there was your mother--"\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a low moan and covered her face with her hands. Jimmy\r\ncame close and laid a caressing arm about her shoulders; but again\r\nPollyanna shrank from him.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, little girl, don\'t! You\'ll break my heart," he begged.\r\n"Don\'t you care for me--ANY? Is it that, and you don\'t want to tell\r\nme?"\r\n\r\nShe dropped her hands and faced him. Her eyes had the hunted look of\r\nsome wild thing at bay.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy, do YOU think--he cares for me--that way?" she entreated, just\r\nabove a whisper.\r\n\r\nJimmy gave his head an impatient shake.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that, Pollyanna,--now. I don\'t know, of course. How should\r\nI? But, dearest, that isn\'t the question. It\'s you. If YOU don\'t care\r\nfor him, and if you\'ll only give me a chance--half a chance to let me\r\nmake you care for me--" He caught her hand, and tried to draw her to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Jimmy, I mustn\'t! I can\'t!" With both her little palms she\r\npushed him from her.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, you don\'t mean you DO care for him?" Jimmy\'s face\r\nwhitened.\r\n\r\n"No; no, indeed--not that way," faltered Pollyanna. "But--don\'t you\r\nsee?--if he cares for me, I\'ll have to--to learn to, someway."\r\n\r\n"POLLYANNA!"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t! Don\'t look at me like that, Jimmy!"\r\n\r\n"You mean you\'d MARRY him, Pollyanna?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!--I mean--why--er--y-yes, I suppose so," she admitted faintly.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, you wouldn\'t! You couldn\'t! Pollyanna, you--you\'re\r\nbreaking my heart."\r\n\r\nPollyanna gave a low sob. Her face was in her hands again. For a\r\nmoment she sobbed on, chokingly; then, with a tragic gesture, she\r\nlifted her head and looked straight into Jimmy\'s anguished,\r\nreproachful eyes.\r\n\r\n"I know it, I know it," she chattered frenziedly. "I\'m breaking mine,\r\ntoo. But I\'ll have to do it. I\'d break your heart, I\'d break mine--but\r\nI\'d never break his!"\r\n\r\nJimmy raised his head. His eyes flashed a sudden fire. His whole\r\nappearance underwent a swift and marvelous change. With a tender,\r\ntriumphant cry he swept Pollyanna into his arms and held her close.\r\n\r\n"Now I KNOW you care for me!" he breathed low in her ear. "You said it\r\nwas breaking YOUR heart, too. Do you think I\'ll give you up now to any\r\nman on earth? Ah, dear, you little understand a love like mine if you\r\nthink I\'d give you up now. Pollyanna, say you love me--say it with\r\nyour own dear lips!"\r\n\r\nFor one long minute Pollyanna lay unresisting in the fiercely tender\r\nembrace that encircled her; then with a sigh that was half content,\r\nhalf renunciation, she began to draw herself away.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Jimmy, I do love you." Jimmy\'s arms tightened, and would have\r\ndrawn her back to him; but something in the girl\'s face forbade. "I\r\nlove you dearly. But I couldn\'t ever be happy with you and feel\r\nthat--Jimmy, don\'t you see, dear? I\'ll have to know--that I\'m free,\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Pollyanna! Of course you\'re free!" Jimmy\'s eyes were\r\nmutinous again.\r\n\r\nPollyanna shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Not with this hanging over me, Jimmy. Don\'t you see? It was mother,\r\nlong ago, that broke his heart--MY MOTHER. And all these years he\'s\r\nlived a lonely, unloved life in consequence. If now he should come to\r\nme and ask me to make that up to him, I\'d HAVE to do it, Jimmy. I\'d\r\nHAVE to. I couldn\'t REFUSE! Don\'t you see?"\r\n\r\nBut Jimmy did not see; he could not see. He would not see, though\r\nPollyanna pleaded and argued long and tearfully. But Pollyanna, too,\r\nwas obdurate, though so sweetly and heartbrokenly obdurate that Jimmy,\r\nin spite of his pain and anger, felt almost like turning comforter.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy, dear," said Pollyanna, at last, "we\'ll have to wait. That\'s\r\nall I can say now. I hope he doesn\'t care; and I--I don\'t believe he\r\ndoes care. But I\'ve got to KNOW. I\'ve got to be sure. We\'ll just have\r\nto wait, a little, till we find out, Jimmy--till we find out!"\r\n\r\nAnd to this plan Jimmy had to submit, though it was with a most\r\nrebellious heart.\r\n\r\n"All right, little girl, it\'ll have to be as you say, of course," he\r\ndespaired. "But, surely, never before was a man kept waiting for his\r\nanswer till the girl he loved, AND WHO LOVED HIM, found out if the\r\nother man wanted her!"\r\n\r\n"I know; but, you see, dear, never before had the other man WANTED her\r\nmother," sighed Pollyanna, her face puckered into an anxious frown.\r\n\r\n"Very well, I\'ll go back to Boston, of course," acceded Jimmy\r\nreluctantly. "But you needn\'t think I\'ve given up--because I haven\'t.\r\nNor I sha\'n\'t give up, just so long as I know you really care for me,\r\nmy little sweetheart," he finished, with a look that sent her\r\npalpitatingly into retreat, just out of reach of his arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nJOHN PENDLETON TURNS THE KEY\r\n\r\n\r\nJimmy went back to Boston that night in a state that was a most\r\ntantalizing commingling of happiness, hope, exasperation, and\r\nrebellion. Behind him he left a girl who was in a scarcely less\r\nenviable frame of mind; for Pollyanna, tremulously happy in the\r\nwondrous thought of Jimmy\'s love for her, was yet so despairingly\r\nterrified at the thought of the possible love of John Pendleton, that\r\nthere was not a thrill of joy that did not carry its pang of fear.\r\n\r\nFortunately for all concerned, however, this state of affairs was not\r\nof long duration; for, as it chanced, John Pendleton, in whose\r\nunwitting hands lay the key to the situation, in less than a week\r\nafter Jimmy\'s hurried visit, turned that key in the lock, and opened\r\nthe door of doubt.\r\n\r\nIt was late Thursday afternoon that John Pendleton called to see\r\nPollyanna. As it happened, he, like Jimmy, saw Pollyanna in the garden\r\nand came straight toward her.\r\n\r\nPollyanna, looking into his face, felt a sudden sinking of the heart.\r\n\r\n"It\'s come--it\'s come!" she shivered; and involuntarily she turned as\r\nif to flee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Involuntarily she turned as if to flee"]\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pollyanna, wait a minute, please," called the man hastening his\r\nsteps. "You\'re just the one I wanted to see. Come, can\'t we go in\r\nhere?" he suggested, turning toward the summerhouse. "I want to speak\r\nto you about--something."\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes, of course," stammered Pollyanna, with forced gayety.\r\nPollyanna knew that she was blushing, and she particularly wished not\r\nto blush just then. It did not help matters any, either, that he\r\nshould have elected to go into the summerhouse for his talk. The\r\nsummerhouse now, to Pollyanna, was sacred to certain dear memories of\r\nJimmy. "And to think it should be here--HERE!" she was shuddering\r\nfrantically. But aloud she said, still gayly, "It\'s a lovely evening,\r\nisn\'t it?"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. John Pendleton strode into the summerhouse and\r\ndropped himself into a rustic chair without even waiting for Pollyanna\r\nto seat herself--a most unusual proceeding on the part of John\r\nPendleton. Pollyanna, stealing a nervous glance at his face found it\r\nso startlingly like the old stern, sour visage of her childhood\'s\r\nremembrance, that she uttered an involuntary exclamation.\r\n\r\nStill John Pendleton paid no heed. Still moodily he sat wrapped in\r\nthought. At last, however, he lifted his head and gazed somberly into\r\nPollyanna\'s startled eyes.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mr. Pendleton."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember the sort of man I was when you first knew me, years\r\nago?"\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes, I think so."\r\n\r\n"Delightfully agreeable specimen of humanity, wasn\'t I?"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her perturbation Pollyanna smiled faintly.\r\n\r\n"I--_I_ liked you, sir." Not until the words were uttered did\r\nPollyanna realize just how they would sound. She strove then,\r\nfrantically, to recall or modify them and had almost added a "that is,\r\nI mean, I liked you THEN!" when she stopped just in time: certainly\r\nTHAT would not have helped matters any! She listened then, fearfully,\r\nfor John Pendleton\'s next words. They came almost at once.\r\n\r\n"I know you did--bless your little heart! And it was that that was the\r\nsaving of me. I wonder, Pollyanna, if I could ever make you realize\r\njust what your childish trust and liking did for me."\r\n\r\nPollyanna stammered a confused protest; but he brushed it smilingly\r\naside.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, it was! It was you, and no one else. I wonder if you\r\nremember another thing, too," resumed the man, after a moment\'s\r\nsilence, during which Pollyanna looked furtively, but longingly toward\r\nthe door. "I wonder if you remember my telling you once that nothing\r\nbut a woman\'s hand and heart, or a child\'s presence could make a\r\nhome."\r\n\r\nPollyanna felt the blood rush to her face.\r\n\r\n"Y-yes, n-no--I mean, yes, I remember it," she stuttered; "but I--I\r\ndon\'t think it\'s always so now. I mean--that is, I\'m sure your home\r\nnow is--is lovely just as \'tis, and--"\r\n\r\n"But it\'s my home I\'m talking about, child," interrupted the man,\r\nimpatiently. "Pollyanna, you know the kind of home I once hoped to\r\nhave, and how those hopes were dashed to the ground. Don\'t think,\r\ndear, I\'m blaming your mother. I\'m not. She but obeyed her heart,\r\nwhich was right; and she made the wiser choice, anyway, as was proved\r\nby the dreary waste I\'ve made of life because of that disappointment.\r\nAfter all, Pollyanna, isn\'t it strange," added John Pendleton, his\r\nvoice growing tender, "that it should be the little hand of her own\r\ndaughter that led me into the path of happiness, at last?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna moistened her lips convulsively.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but Mr. Pendleton, I--I--"\r\n\r\nOnce again the man brushed aside her protests with a smiling gesture.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was, Pollyanna, your little hand in the long ago--you, and\r\nyour glad game."\r\n\r\n"Oh-h!" Pollyanna relaxed visibly in her seat. The terror in her eyes\r\nbegan slowly to recede.\r\n\r\n"And so all these years I\'ve been gradually growing into a different\r\nman, Pollyanna. But there\'s one thing I haven\'t changed in, my dear."\r\nHe paused, looked away, then turned gravely tender eyes back to her\r\nface. "I still think it takes a woman\'s hand and heart or a child\'s\r\npresence to make a home."\r\n\r\n"Yes; b-but you\'ve g-got the child\'s presence," plunged in Pollyanna,\r\nthe terror coming back to her eyes. "There\'s Jimmy, you know."\r\n\r\nThe man gave an amused laugh.\r\n\r\n"I know; but--I don\'t think even you would say that Jimmy is--is\r\nexactly a CHILD\'S presence any longer," he remarked.\r\n\r\n"N-no, of course not."\r\n\r\n"Besides--Pollyanna, I\'ve made up my mind. I\'ve got to have the\r\nwoman\'s hand and heart." His voice dropped, and trembled a little.\r\n\r\n"Oh-h, have you?" Pollyanna\'s fingers met and clutched each other in a\r\nspasmodic clasp. John Pendleton, however, seemed neither to hear nor\r\nsee. He had leaped to his feet, and was nervously pacing up and down\r\nthe little house.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna," he stopped and faced her; "if--if you were I, and were\r\ngoing to ask the woman you loved to come and make your old gray pile\r\nof stone a home, how would you go to work to do it?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna half started from her chair. Her eyes sought the door, this\r\ntime openly, longingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, but, Mr. Pendleton, I wouldn\'t do it at all, at all," she\r\nstammered, a little wildly. "I\'m sure you\'d be--much happier as--as\r\nyou are."\r\n\r\nThe man stared in puzzled surprise, then laughed grimly.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, Pollyanna, is it--quite so bad as that?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"B-bad?" Pollyanna had the appearance of being poised for flight.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Is that just your way of trying to soften the blow of saying\r\nthat you don\'t think she\'d have me, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, n-no--no, indeed. She\'d say yes--she\'d HAVE to say yes, you\r\nknow," explained Pollyanna, with terrified earnestness. "But I\'ve been\r\nthinking--I mean, I was thinking that if--if the girl didn\'t love you,\r\nyou really would be happier without her; and--" At the look that came\r\ninto John Pendleton\'s face, Pollyanna stopped short.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t want her, if she didn\'t love me, Pollyanna."\r\n\r\n"No, I thought not, too." Pollyanna began to look a little less\r\ndistracted.\r\n\r\n"Besides, she doesn\'t happen to be a girl," went on John Pendleton.\r\n"She\'s a mature woman who, presumedly, would know her own mind." The\r\nman\'s voice was grave and slightly reproachful.\r\n\r\n"Oh-h-h! Oh!" exclaimed Pollyanna, the dawning happiness in her eyes\r\nleaping forth in a flash of ineffable joy and relief. "Then you love\r\nsomebody--" By an almost superhuman effort Pollyanna choked off the\r\n"else" before it left her delighted lips.\r\n\r\n"Love somebody! Haven\'t I just been telling you I did?" laughed John\r\nPendleton, half vexedly. "What I want to know is--can she be made to\r\nlove me? That\'s where I was sort of--of counting on your help,\r\nPollyanna. You see, she\'s a dear friend of yours."\r\n\r\n"Is she?" gurgled Pollyanna. "Then she\'ll just have to love you. We\'ll\r\nmake her! Maybe she does, anyway, already. Who is she?"\r\n\r\nThere was a long pause before the answer came.\r\n\r\n"I believe, after all, Pollyanna, I won\'t--yes, I will, too.\r\nIt\'s--can\'t you guess?--Mrs. Carew."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" breathed Pollyanna, with a face of unclouded joy. "How perfectly\r\nlovely! I\'m so glad, GLAD, GLAD!"\r\n\r\nA long hour later Pollyanna sent Jimmy a letter. It was confused and\r\nincoherent--a series of half-completed, illogical, but shyly joyous\r\nsentences, out of which Jimmy gathered much: a little from what was\r\nwritten; more from what was left unwritten. After all, did he really\r\nneed more than this?\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jimmy, he doesn\'t love me a bit. It\'s some one else. I mustn\'t\r\ntell you who it is--but her name isn\'t Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nJimmy had just time to catch the seven o\'clock train for\r\nBeldingsville--and he caught it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nAFTER LONG YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nPollyanna was so happy that night after she had sent her letter to\r\nJimmy that she could not quite keep it to herself. Always before going\r\nto bed she stepped into her aunt\'s room to see if anything were\r\nneeded. To-night, after the usual questions, she had turned to put out\r\nthe light when a sudden impulse sent her back to her aunt\'s bedside. A\r\nlittle breathlessly she dropped on her knees.\r\n\r\n"Aunt Polly, I\'m so happy I just had to tell some one. I WANT to tell\r\nyou. May I?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me? Tell me what, child? Of course you may tell me. You mean,\r\nit\'s good news--for ME?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, dear; I hope so," blushed Pollyanna. "I hope it will make\r\nyou--GLAD, a little, for me, you know. Of course Jimmy will tell you\r\nhimself all properly some day. But _I_ wanted to tell you first."\r\n\r\n"Jimmy!" Mrs. Chilton\'s face changed perceptibly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, when--when he--he asks you for me," stammered Pollyanna, with a\r\nradiant flood of color. "Oh, I--I\'m so happy, I HAD to tell you!"\r\n\r\n"Asks me for you! Pollyanna!" Mrs. Chilton pulled herself up in bed.\r\n"You don\'t mean to say there\'s anything SERIOUS between you and--Jimmy\r\nBean!"\r\n\r\nPollyanna fell back in dismay.\r\n\r\n"Why, auntie, I thought you LIKED Jimmy!"\r\n\r\n"So I do--in his place. But that place isn\'t the husband of my niece."\r\n\r\n"AUNT POLLY!"\r\n\r\n"Come, come, child, don\'t look so shocked. This is all sheer nonsense,\r\nand I\'m glad I\'ve been able to stop it before it\'s gone any further."\r\n\r\n"But, Aunt Polly, it HAS gone further," quavered Pollyanna. "Why, I--I\r\nalready have learned to lo-- --c-care for him--dearly."\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll have to unlearn it, Pollyanna, for never, never will I\r\ngive my consent to your marrying Jimmy Bean."\r\n\r\n"But--w-why, auntie?"\r\n\r\n"First and foremost because we know nothing about him."\r\n\r\n"Why, Aunt Polly, we\'ve always known him, ever since I was a little\r\ngirl!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and what was he? A rough little runaway urchin from an Orphans\'\r\nHome! We know nothing whatever about his people, and his pedigree."\r\n\r\n"But I\'m not marrying his p-people and his p-pedigree!"\r\n\r\nWith an impatient groan Aunt Polly fell back on her pillow.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, you\'re making me positively ill. My heart is going like a\r\ntrip hammer. I sha\'n\'t sleep a wink to-night. CAN\'T you let this thing\r\nrest till morning?"\r\n\r\nPollyanna was on her feet instantly, her face all contrition.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes--yes, indeed; of course, Aunt Polly! And to-morrow you\'ll\r\nfeel different, I\'m sure. I\'m sure you will," reiterated the girl, her\r\nvoice quivering with hope again, as she turned to extinguish the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBut Aunt Polly did not "feel different" in the morning. If anything,\r\nher opposition to the marriage was even more determined. In vain\r\nPollyanna pleaded and argued. In vain she showed how deeply her\r\nhappiness was concerned. Aunt Polly was obdurate. She would have none\r\nof the idea. She sternly admonished Pollyanna as to the possible evils\r\nof heredity, and warned her of the dangers of marrying into she knew\r\nnot what sort of family. She even appealed at last to her sense of\r\nduty and gratitude toward herself, and reminded Pollyanna of the long\r\nyears of loving care that had been hers in the home of her aunt, and\r\nshe begged her piteously not to break her heart by this marriage as\r\nhad her mother years before by HER marriage.\r\n\r\nWhen Jimmy himself, radiant-faced and glowing-eyed, came at ten\r\no\'clock, he was met by a frightened, sob-shaken little Pollyanna that\r\ntried ineffectually to hold him back with two trembling hands. With\r\nwhitening cheeks, but with defiantly tender arms that held her close,\r\nhe demanded an explanation.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, dearest, what in the world is the meaning of this?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, why did you come, why did you come? I was going to\r\nwrite and tell you straight away," moaned Pollyanna.\r\n\r\n"But you did write me, dear. I got it yesterday afternoon, just in\r\ntime to catch my train."\r\n\r\n"No, no;--AGAIN, I mean. I didn\'t know then that I--I couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t! Pollyanna,"--his eyes flamed into stern wrath,--"you don\'t\r\nmean to tell me there\'s anybody ELSE\'S love you think you\'ve got to\r\nkeep me waiting for?" he demanded, holding her at arm\'s length.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Jimmy! Don\'t look at me like that. I can\'t bear it!"\r\n\r\n"Then what is it? What is it you can\'t do?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t--marry you."\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, do you love me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Oh, y-yes."\r\n\r\n"Then you shall marry me," triumphed Jimmy, his arms enfolding her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Jimmy, you don\'t understand. It\'s--Aunt Polly," struggled\r\nPollyanna.\r\n\r\n"AUNT POLLY!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. She--won\'t let me."\r\n\r\n"Ho!" Jimmy tossed his head with a light laugh. "We\'ll fix Aunt Polly.\r\nShe thinks she\'s going to lose you, but we\'ll just remind her that\r\nshe--she\'s going to gain a--a new nephew!" he finished in mock\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nBut Pollyanna did not smile. She turned her head hopelessly from side\r\nto side.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Jimmy, you don\'t understand! She--she--oh, how can I tell\r\nyou?--she objects to--to YOU--for--ME."\r\n\r\nJimmy\'s arms relaxed a little. His eyes sobered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, I suppose I can\'t blame her for that. I\'m no--wonder, of\r\ncourse," he admitted constrainedly. "Still,"--he turned loving eyes\r\nupon her--"I\'d try to make you--happy, dear."\r\n\r\n"Indeed you would! I know you would," protested Pollyanna, tearfully.\r\n\r\n"Then why not--give me a chance to try, Pollyanna, even if\r\nshe--doesn\'t quite approve, at first. Maybe in time, after we were\r\nmarried, we could win her over."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but I couldn\'t--I couldn\'t do that," moaned Pollyanna, "after\r\nwhat she\'s said. I couldn\'t--without her consent. You see, she\'s done\r\nso much for me, and she\'s so dependent on me. She isn\'t well a bit,\r\nnow, Jimmy. And, really, lately she\'s been so--so loving, and she\'s\r\nbeen trying so hard to--to play the game, you know, in spite of all\r\nher troubles. And she--she cried, Jimmy, and begged me not to break\r\nher heart as--as mother did long ago. And--and Jimmy, I--I just\r\ncouldn\'t, after all she\'s done for me."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment\'s pause; then, with a vivid red mounting to her\r\nforehead, Pollyanna spoke again, brokenly.\r\n\r\n"Jimmy, if you--if you could only tell Aunt Polly something\r\nabout--about your father, and your people, and--"\r\n\r\nJimmy\'s arms dropped suddenly. He stepped back a little. The color\r\ndrained from his face.\r\n\r\n"Is--that--it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes." Pollyanna came nearer, and touched his arm timidly. "Don\'t\r\nthink--It isn\'t for me, Jimmy. I don\'t care. Besides, I KNOW that your\r\nfather and your people were all--all fine and noble, because YOU are\r\nso fine and noble. But she--Jimmy, don\'t look at me like that!"\r\n\r\nBut Jimmy, with a low moan had turned quite away from her. A minute\r\nlater, with only a few choking words, which she could not understand,\r\nhe had left the house.\r\n\r\nFrom the Harrington homestead Jimmy went straight home and sought out\r\nJohn Pendleton. He found him in the great crimson-hung library where,\r\nsome years before, Pollyanna had looked fearfully about for the\r\n"skeleton in John Pendleton\'s closet."\r\n\r\n"Uncle John, do you remember that packet father gave me?" demanded\r\nJimmy.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes. What\'s the matter, son?" John Pendleton had given a start\r\nof surprise at sight of Jimmy\'s face.\r\n\r\n"That packet has got to be opened, sir."\r\n\r\n"But--the conditions!"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help it. It\'s got to be. That\'s all. Will you do it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes, my boy, of course, if you insist; but--" he paused\r\nhelplessly.\r\n\r\n"Uncle John, as perhaps you have guessed, I love Pollyanna. I asked\r\nher to be my wife, and she consented." The elder man made a delighted\r\nexclamation, but the other did not pause, or change his sternly intent\r\nexpression. "She says now she can\'t--marry me. Mrs. Chilton objects.\r\nShe objects to ME."\r\n\r\n"OBJECTS to YOU!" John Pendleton\'s eyes flashed angrily.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I found out why when--when Pollyanna begged if I couldn\'t tell\r\nher aunt something about--about my father and my people."\r\n\r\n"Shucks! I thought Polly Chilton had more sense--still, it\'s just like\r\nher, after all. The Harringtons have always been inordinately proud of\r\nrace and family," snapped John Pendleton. "Well, could you?"\r\n\r\n"COULD _I_! It was on the end of my tongue to tell Pollyanna that\r\nthere couldn\'t have been a better father than mine was; then,\r\nsuddenly, I remembered--the packet, and what it said. And I was\r\nafraid. I didn\'t dare say a word till I knew what was inside that\r\npacket. There\'s something dad didn\'t want me to know till I was thirty\r\nyears old--when I would be a man grown, and could stand anything. See?\r\nThere\'s a secret somewhere in our lives. I\'ve got to know that secret,\r\nand I\'ve got to know it now."\r\n\r\n"But, Jimmy, lad, don\'t look so tragic. It may be a good secret.\r\nPerhaps it\'ll be something you\'ll LIKE to know."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps. But if it had been, would he have been apt to keep it from\r\nme till I was thirty years old? No! Uncle John, it was something he\r\nwas trying to save me from till I was old enough to stand it and not\r\nflinch. Understand, I\'m not blaming dad. Whatever it was, it was\r\nsomething he couldn\'t help, I\'ll warrant. But WHAT it was I\'ve got to\r\nknow. Will you get it, please? It\'s in your safe, you know."\r\n\r\nJohn Pendleton rose at once.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll get it," he said. Three minutes later it lay in Jimmy\'s hand;\r\nbut Jimmy held it out at once.\r\n\r\n"I would rather you read it, sir, please. Then tell me."\r\n\r\n"But, Jimmy, I--very well." With a decisive gesture John Pendleton\r\npicked up a paper-cutter, opened the envelope, and pulled out the\r\ncontents. There was a package of several papers tied together, and one\r\nfolded sheet alone, apparently a letter. This John Pendleton opened\r\nand read first. And as he read, Jimmy, tense and breathless, watched\r\nhis face. He saw, therefore, the look of amazement, joy, and something\r\nelse he could not name, that leaped into John Pendleton\'s countenance.\r\n\r\n"Uncle John, what is it? What is it?" he demanded.\r\n\r\n"Read it--for yourself," answered the man, thrusting the letter into\r\nJimmy\'s outstretched hand. And Jimmy read this:\r\n\r\n"The enclosed papers are the legal proof that my boy Jimmy is really\r\nJames Kent, son of John Kent, who married Doris Wetherby, daughter of\r\nWilliam Wetherby of Boston. There is also a letter in which I explain\r\nto my boy why I have kept him from his mother\'s family all these\r\nyears. If this packet is opened by him at thirty years of age, he will\r\nread this letter, and I hope will forgive a father who feared to lose\r\nhis boy entirely, so took this drastic course to keep him to himself.\r\nIf it is opened by strangers, because of his death, I request that his\r\nmother\'s people in Boston be notified at once, and the inclosed\r\npackage of papers be given, intact, into their hands.\r\n\r\n"JOHN KENT."\r\n\r\nJimmy was pale and shaken when he looked up to meet John Pendleton\'s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Am I--the lost--Jamie?" he faltered.\r\n\r\n"That letter says you have documents there to prove it," nodded the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Carew\'s nephew?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"But, why--what--I can\'t realize it!" There was a moment\'s pause\r\nbefore into Jimmy\'s face flashed a new joy. "Then, surely now I know\r\nwho I am! I can tell--Mrs. Chilton SOMETHING of my people."\r\n\r\n"I should say you could," retorted John Pendleton, dryly. "The Boston\r\nWetherbys can trace straight back to the crusades, and I don\'t know\r\nbut to the year one. That ought to satisfy her. As for your father--he\r\ncame of good stock, too, Mrs. Carew told me, though he was rather\r\neccentric, and not pleasing to the family, as you know, of course."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Poor dad! And what a life he must have lived with me all those\r\nyears--always dreading pursuit. I can understand--lots of things, now,\r\nthat used to puzzle me. A woman called me \'Jamie,\' once. Jove! how\r\nangry he was! I know now why he hurried me away that night without\r\neven waiting for supper. Poor dad! It was right after that he was\r\ntaken sick. He couldn\'t use his hands or his feet, and very soon he\r\ncouldn\'t talk straight. Something ailed his speech. I remember when he\r\ndied he was trying to tell me something about this packet. I believe\r\nnow he was telling me to open it, and go to my mother\'s people; but I\r\nthought then he was just telling me to keep it safe. So that\'s what I\r\npromised him. But it didn\'t comfort him any. It only seemed to worry\r\nhim more. You see, I didn\'t understand. Poor dad!"\r\n\r\n"Suppose we take a look at these papers," suggested John Pendleton.\r\n"Besides, there\'s a letter from your father to you, I understand.\r\nDon\'t you want to read it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, of course. And then--" the young fellow laughed shamefacedly and\r\nglanced at the clock--"I was wondering just how soon I could go\r\nback--to Pollyanna."\r\n\r\nA thoughtful frown came to John Pendleton\'s face. He glanced at Jimmy,\r\nhesitated, then spoke.\r\n\r\n"I know you want to see Pollyanna, lad, and I don\'t blame you; but it\r\nstrikes me that, under the circumstances, you should go first to--Mrs.\r\nCarew, and take these." He tapped the papers before him.\r\n\r\nJimmy drew his brows together and pondered.\r\n\r\n"All right, sir, I will." he agreed resignedly.\r\n\r\n"And if you don\'t mind, I\'d like to go with you," further suggested\r\nJohn Pendleton, a little diffidently.\r\n\r\n"I--I have a little matter of my own that I\'d like to see--your aunt\r\nabout. Suppose we go down today on the three o\'clock?"\r\n\r\n"Good! We will, sir. Gorry! And so I\'m Jamie! I can\'t grasp it yet!"\r\nexclaimed the young man, springing to his feet, and restlessly moving\r\nabout the room. "I wonder, now," he stopped, and colored boyishly, "do\r\nyou think--Aunt Ruth--will mind--very much?"\r\n\r\nJohn Pendleton shook his head. A hint of the old somberness came into\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n"Hardly, my boy. But--I\'m thinking of myself. How about it? When\r\nyou\'re her boy, where am I coming in?"\r\n\r\n"You! Do you think ANYTHING could put you one side?" scoffed Jimmy,\r\nfervently. "You needn\'t worry about that. And SHE won\'t mind. She has\r\nJamie, you know, and--" He stopped short, a dawning dismay in his\r\neyes. "By George! Uncle John, I forgot--Jamie. This is going to be\r\ntough on--Jamie!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'d thought of that. Still, he\'s legally adopted, isn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; it isn\'t that. It\'s the fact that he isn\'t the real Jamie\r\nhimself--and he with his two poor useless legs! Why, Uncle John, it\'ll\r\njust about kill him. I\'ve heard him talk. I know. Besides, Pollyanna\r\nand Mrs. Carew both have told me how he feels, how SURE he is, and how\r\nhappy he is. Great Scott! I can\'t take away from him this--But what\r\nCAN I do?" "I don\'t know, my boy. I don\'t see as there\'s anything you\r\ncan do, but what you are doing."\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Jimmy had resumed his nervous pacing up and\r\ndown the room. Suddenly he wheeled, his face alight.\r\n\r\n"There IS a way, and I\'ll do it. I KNOW Mrs. Carew will agree. WE\r\nWON\'T TELL! We won\'t tell anybody but Mrs. Carew herself, and--and\r\nPollyanna and her aunt. I\'ll HAVE to tell them," he added defensively.\r\n\r\n"You certainly will, my boy. As for the rest--" John Pendleton paused\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nobody\'s business."\r\n\r\n"But, remember, you are making quite a sacrifice--in several ways. I\r\nwant you to weigh it well."\r\n\r\n"Weigh it? I have weighed it, and there\'s nothing in it--with Jamie on\r\nthe other side of the scales, sir. I just couldn\'t do it. That\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t blame you, and I think you\'re right," declared John Pendleton\r\nheartily. "Furthermore, I believe Mrs. Carew will agree with you,\r\nparticularly as she\'ll KNOW now that the real Jamie is found at last."\r\n\r\n"You know she\'s always said she\'d seen me somewhere," chuckled Jimmy.\r\n"Now how soon does that train go? I\'m ready."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m not," laughed John Pendleton. "Luckily for me it doesn\'t go\r\nfor some hours yet, anyhow," he finished, as he got to his feet and\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nA NEW ALADDIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever were John Pendleton\'s preparations for departure--and they\r\nwere both varied and hurried--they were done in the open, with two\r\nexceptions. The exceptions were two letters, one addressed to\r\nPollyanna, and one to Mrs. Polly Chilton. These letters, together with\r\ncareful and minute instructions, were given into the hands of Susan,\r\nhis housekeeper, to be delivered after they should be gone. But of all\r\nthis Jimmy knew nothing.\r\n\r\nThe travelers were nearing Boston when John Pendleton said to Jimmy:\r\n\r\n"My boy, I\'ve got one favor to ask--or rather, two. The first is that\r\nwe say nothing to Mrs. Carew until to-morrow afternoon; the other is\r\nthat you allow me to go first and be your--er--ambassador, you\r\nyourself not appearing on the scene until perhaps, say--four o\'clock.\r\nAre you willing?"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I am," replied Jimmy, promptly; "not only willing, but\r\ndelighted. I\'d been wondering how I was going to break the ice, and\r\nI\'m glad to have somebody else do it."\r\n\r\n"Good! Then I\'ll try to get--YOUR AUNT on the telephone to-morrow\r\nmorning and make my appointment."\r\n\r\nTrue to his promise, Jimmy did not appear at the Carew mansion until\r\nfour o\'clock the next afternoon. Even then he felt suddenly so\r\nembarrassed that he walked twice by the house before he summoned\r\nsufficient courage to go up the steps and ring the bell. Once in Mrs.\r\nCarew\'s presence, however, he was soon his natural self, so quickly\r\ndid she set him at his ease, and so tactfully did she handle the\r\nsituation. To be sure, at the very first, there were a few tears, and\r\na few incoherent exclamations. Even John Pendleton had to reach a\r\nhasty hand for his handkerchief. But before very long a semblance of\r\nnormal tranquillity was restored, and only the tender glow in Mrs.\r\nCarew\'s eyes, and the ecstatic happiness in Jimmy\'s and John\r\nPendleton\'s was left to mark the occasion as something out of the\r\nordinary.\r\n\r\n"And I think it\'s so fine of you--about Jamie!" exclaimed Mrs. Carew,\r\nafter a little. "Indeed, Jimmy--(I shall still call you Jimmy, for\r\nobvious reasons; besides, I like it better, for you)--indeed I think\r\nyou\'re just right, if you\'re willing to do it. And I\'m making some\r\nsacrifice myself, too," she went on tearfully, "for I should be so\r\nproud to introduce you to the world as my nephew."\r\n\r\n"And, indeed, Aunt Ruth, I--" At a half-stifled exclamation from John\r\nPendleton, Jimmy stopped short. He saw then that Jamie and Sadie Dean\r\nstood just inside the door. Jamie\'s face was very white.\r\n\r\n"AUNT RUTH!" he exclaimed, looking from one to the other with startled\r\neyes. "AUNT RUTH! You don\'t mean--"\r\n\r\nAll the blood receded from Mrs. Carew\'s face, and from Jimmy\'s, too.\r\nJohn Pendleton, however, advanced jauntily.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Jamie; why not? I was going to tell you soon, anyway, so I\'ll\r\ntell you now." (Jimmy gasped and stepped hastily forward, but John\r\nPendleton silenced him with a look.) "Just a little while ago Mrs.\r\nCarew made me the happiest of men by saying yes to a certain question\r\nI asked. Now, as Jimmy calls me \'Uncle John,\' why shouldn\'t he begin\r\nright away to call Mrs. Carew \'Aunt Ruth\'?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! Oh-h!" exclaimed Jamie, in plain delight, while Jimmy, under John\r\nPendleton\'s steady gaze just managed to save the situation by not\r\nblurting out HIS surprise and pleasure. Naturally, too, just then,\r\nblushing Mrs. Carew became the center of every one\'s interest, and the\r\ndanger point was passed. Only Jimmy heard John Pendleton say low in\r\nhis ear, a bit later:\r\n\r\n"So you see, you young rascal, I\'m not going to lose you, after all.\r\nWe shall BOTH have you now."\r\n\r\nExclamations and congratulations were still at their height, when\r\nJamie, a new light in his eyes, turned without warning to Sadie Dean.\r\n\r\n"Sadie, I\'m going to tell them now," he declared triumphantly. Then,\r\nwith the bright color in Sadie\'s face telling the tender story even\r\nbefore Jamie\'s eager lips could frame the words, more congratulations\r\nand exclamations were in order, and everybody was laughing and shaking\r\nhands with everybody else.\r\n\r\nJimmy, however, very soon began to eye them all aggrievedly,\r\nlongingly.\r\n\r\n"This is all very well for YOU," he complained then. "You each have\r\neach other. But where do I come in? I can just tell you, though, that\r\nif only a certain young lady I know were here, _I_ should have\r\nsomething to tell YOU, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Just a minute, Jimmy," interposed John Pendleton. "Let\'s play I was\r\nAladdin, and let me rub the lamp. Mrs. Carew, have I your permission\r\nto ring for Mary?"\r\n\r\n"Why, y-yes, certainly," murmured that lady, in a puzzled surprise\r\nthat found its duplicate on the faces of the others.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Mary stood in the doorway.\r\n\r\n"Did I hear Miss Pollyanna come in a short time ago?" asked John\r\nPendleton.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. She is here."\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you ask her to come down, please."\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna here!" exclaimed an amazed chorus, as Mary disappeared.\r\nJimmy turned very white, then very red.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I sent a note to her yesterday by my housekeeper. I took the\r\nliberty of asking her down for a few days to see you, Mrs. Carew. I\r\nthought the little girl needed a rest and a holiday; and my\r\nhousekeeper has instructions to remain and care for Mrs. Chilton. I\r\nalso wrote a note to Mrs. Chilton herself," he added, turning suddenly\r\nto Jimmy, with unmistakable meaning in his eyes. "And I thought after\r\nshe read what I said, that she\'d let Pollyanna come. It seems she did,\r\nfor--here she is."\r\n\r\nAnd there she was in the doorway, blushing, starry-eyed, yet withal\r\njust a bit shy and questioning.\r\n\r\n"Pollyanna, dearest!" It was Jimmy who sprang forward to meet her, and\r\nwho, without one minute\'s hesitation, took her in his arms and kissed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jimmy, before all these people!" breathed Pollyanna in\r\nembarrassed protest.\r\n\r\n"Pooh! I should have kissed you then, Pollyanna, if you\'d been\r\nstraight in the middle of--of Washington Street itself," vowed Jimmy.\r\n"For that matter, look at--\'all these people\' and see for yourself if\r\nyou need to worry about them."\r\n\r\nAnd Pollyanna looked; and she saw:\r\n\r\nOver by one window, backs carefully turned, Jamie and Sadie Dean; over\r\nby another window, backs also carefully turned, Mrs. Carew and John\r\nPendleton.\r\n\r\nPollyanna smiled--so adorably that Jimmy kissed her again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jimmy, isn\'t it all beautiful and wonderful?" she murmured\r\nsoftly. "And Aunt Polly--she knows everything now; and it\'s all right.\r\nI think it would have been all right, anyway. She was beginning to\r\nfeel so bad--for me. Now she\'s so glad. And I am, too. Why, Jimmy, I\'m\r\nglad, GLAD, _GLAD_ for--everything, now!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "\'I\'m glad, GLAD, _GLAD_ for--everything now!\'"]\r\n\r\nJimmy caught his breath with a joy that hurt.\r\n\r\n"God grant, little girl, that always it may be so--with you," he\r\nchoked unsteadily, his arms holding her close.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure it will," sighed Pollyanna, with shining eyes of confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Pollyanna Grows Up, by Eleanor H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\r\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
