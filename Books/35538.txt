The children (so-called, though the majority were grown up) had\r\nall retired for the night. Mr. and Mrs. Darrell sat up later, having\r\nmuch to talk about, as he would leave next day for Southern California,\r\nintending to locate\xe2\x80\x94somewhere in a desirable neighborhood\xe2\x80\x94a homestead\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mrs. Darrell, seeing that her husband smoked his\r\npipe in silence, adding no observations to her own, \xe2\x80\x9clet us this time be\r\nguided by our own past history, William\xe2\x80\x94our experience. In other words,\r\nlet us be wise, my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy way of variety, you mean,\xe2\x80\x9d said he smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is, as far as I am\r\nconcerned, because I own, frankly, that had I been guided by your\r\nadvice\xe2\x80\x94your wisdom\xe2\x80\x94we would be much better off to-day. You have a right\r\nto reproach me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish to do anything of the kind. I think reproaches seldom do\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use in crying over spilt milk, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not my idea, either. On the contrary, if by \xe2\x80\x98_milk_\xe2\x80\x99 it is\r\nmeant all or any earthly good whatever, it is the \xe2\x80\x98_spilt milk_\xe2\x80\x99 that we\r\nshould lament. There is no reason to cry for the milk that has not been\r\nwasted, the good that is not lost. So let us cry for the _spilt milk_,\r\nby all means, if by doing so we learn how to avoid spilling any more.\r\nLet us cry for the _spilt milk_, and remember how, and where, and when,\r\nand why, we spilt it. Much wisdom is learnt through tears, but none by\r\nforgetting our lessons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how can a man learn when he is born a fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly an idiot is, truly speaking, a born fool; a fool to such a degree\r\nthat he cannot act wisely if he will. It is only when _perversity_ is\r\nadded to foolishness, that a being\xe2\x80\x94not an idiot\xe2\x80\x94is utterly a fool. To\r\npersist in acting wrongfully, that is the real folly. To reject good\r\ncounsel, either of one\xe2\x80\x99s own good thoughts or the good thoughts of\r\nothers. But to act foolishly by deciding hastily, by lack of mature\r\nreflection, that I should only call a foolish mistake. So, then, if we\r\nhave been foolish, let us at least utilize our foolishness by drawing\r\nfrom it lessons of wisdom for the future. We cannot conscientiously\r\nplead that we are born fools when we see our errors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Darrell smilingly bowed, and with a voice much softer than his usual\r\nstentorian tones, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, little wife, but I fear that my streak of perversity is a\r\nbroad one, and has solely been the bane of my life; it has a fatality\r\naccompanying it. I have often seen the right way to act, and yet I have\r\ngone with my eyes wide open to do the wrong thing. And this, too, not\r\nmeaning to do harm to any one, nor wishing to be malicious or mean. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what power impelled me. But if you will forgive my past\r\nwickedness, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak of your wickedness, for real wickedness is\r\nperversity. You have acted wrongly at times, when you have misapplied\r\nyour rights and the rights of others, but you have not intentionally\r\ndone wrong. You are not perverse; don\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a few days it will be twenty-four years since we crossed the plains\r\nwith our three babies, in our caravan of four wagons, followed by our\r\nfine horses and choice Durham cows. I firmly believed then, that with my\r\nfine stock and my good bank account, and broad government lands, free to\r\nall Americans, I should have given you a nice home before I was five\r\nyears older; that I would have saved money and would be getting more to\r\nmake us rich before I was old. But see, at the end of twenty-four years,\r\nwhere and how do I find myself? I am still poor, all I have earned is\r\nthe name of \xe2\x80\x98_Squatter_.\xe2\x80\x99 That pretty name (which I hate because you\r\ndespise it) is what I have earned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that either, William. We will only recommence one of numerous\r\nfruitless discussions. We are not poor, because we have enough to live\r\nin comfort, and I do not despise the name of Squatter, for it is\r\nharmless enough, but I do certainly disapprove of acts done by men\r\nbecause they are squatters, or to become squatters. They have caused\r\nmuch trouble to people who never harmed them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey, too, the poor squatters, have suffered as much distress as they\r\nhave caused, the poor hard-worked toilers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very true, but I am afraid I shall never be able to see the\r\nnecessity of any one being a squatter in this blessed country of\r\nplentiful broad acres, which a most liberal government gives away for\r\nthe asking.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly it. We aren\xe2\x80\x99t squatters. We are \xe2\x80\x98_settlers_.\xe2\x80\x99 We take up\r\nland that belongs to us, American citizens, by paying the government\r\nprice for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you take up government land, yes, you are \xe2\x80\x98settlers,\xe2\x80\x99 but not\r\nwhen you locate claims on land belonging to any one else. In that case,\r\nyou must accept the epithet of \xe2\x80\x98_Squatter_.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDarrell set his teeth so tightly, that he bit a little chip off his\r\npipe. Mrs. Darrell went on as if she had not observed her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflash of irritation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hope we will never more deserve such name; I trust that before\r\nyou locate any homestead claim in Southern California, you will first\r\ninform yourself, very carefully, whether any one has a previous claim.\r\nAnd more specially, I beg of you, do not go on a Mexican grant unless\r\nyou buy the land from the owner. This I beg of you specially, and must\r\n_insist upon it_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how am I to know who is the owner of a rancho that has been\r\nrejected, for instance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the rancho is still in litigation, don\xe2\x80\x99t buy land in it, or if you\r\ndo, buy title from the original grantee, on fair conditions and clear\r\nunderstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that can be done in the Alamar rancho, which I am\r\ngoing to see, and I know it has been rejected. But of one thing you can\r\nrest assured, that I shall not forget our sad experience in Napa and\r\nSonoma valleys, where\xe2\x80\x94after years of hard toil\xe2\x80\x94I had to abandon our home\r\nand lose the earnings of years and years of hard work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all I ask, William. To remember our experience in Napa and\r\nSonoma. To remember, also, that we are no longer young. We cannot afford\r\nto throw away another twenty years of our life; and really and truly, if\r\nyou again go into a Mexican grant, William, I shall not follow you there\r\nwillingly. Do not expect it of me; I shall only go if you compel me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompel you!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cCompel you, when you know I have\r\nobeyed you all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! no, William, not all your life, for you were well grown before I\r\never saw you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean ever since I went to Washington with my mind made up to jump off\r\nthe train coming back, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree to come North to be my\r\ncommandant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have been a very strict disciplinarian,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nsmiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the subaltern has had pretty much his own way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, when he thinks he might. But when the commandant pulls the string,\r\nby looking sad or offended, then good-by to the spirit and independence\r\nof the subaltern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I must not forget to ask you;\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going back to the\r\npoint of their digression, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is, not to believe what those men\r\nhave been telling you about the Alamar rancho having been finally\r\nrejected. You know John Gasbang could never speak the truth, and years\r\nhave not made him more reliable. As for Miller, Hughes and Mathews, they\r\nare dishonest enough, and though not so brazen as Gasbang, they will\r\nmisrepresent facts to induce you to go with them, for they want you with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know they do; I see through all that. But I see, too, that San Diego\r\nis sure to have a railroad direct to the Eastern States. Lands will\r\nincrease in value immediately; so I think, myself, I had better take\r\ntime by the forelock and get a good lot of land in the Alamar grant,\r\nwhich is quite near town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, are you sure it is finally rejected?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the book, where the fact is recorded. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that enough?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if there has been no error.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways the same cautious Mary Moreneau, who tortured me with her doubts\r\nand would not have me until Father White took compassion on me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, smiling, looking at her fondly, for his thoughts reverted back to\r\nthose days when Miss Mary was _afraid_ to marry him; but, after all, he\r\nwon her and brought her all the way from Washington to his New England\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWilliam Darrell was already a well-to-do young farmer in those days, a\r\nbachelor twenty-eight to thirty years of age, sole heir to a flourishing\r\nNew England farm, and with a good account in a Boston bank, when Miss\r\nMary Moreneau came to New England from Washington to visit her aunt,\r\nMrs. Newton. As Mrs. Newton\xe2\x80\x99s husband was William Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s uncle,\r\nnothing was more natural than for Mary to meet him at his uncle\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nNobody expected that William would fall in love with her, as he seemed\r\nto be proof against Cupid\xe2\x80\x99s darts. The marriageable maidens of William\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nneighborhood had in vain tried to attract the obdurate young farmer, who\r\nseemed to enjoy no other society than that of his uncle Newton and his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nBut Mary came and William surrendered at once. She, however, gave him no\r\nencouragement. Her coldness seemed only to inflame his love the more,\r\nuntil Miss Moreneau thought it was best to shorten her visit and return\r\nhome about the middle of September.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you to return home so early?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked Mary, after Mrs.\r\nNewton had informed him of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s intention of going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I think it is best,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it best?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor several reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be permitted to ask what are those reasons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. One reason is, that as I came to see my aunt and at the same\r\ntime to rest and improve my health, and all those objects have been\r\naccomplished, I might as well go home. Then, my other aunt, with whom I\r\nreside, is not feeling well. She went to spend the summer in Virginia,\r\nbut writes that her health has not improved much, and she will soon come\r\nback to Washington. Then some of my pupils will want to recommence their\r\nlessons soon, and I want to have some little time to myself before I\r\nbegin to work. You know, Mr. Darrell, I teach to support myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, only because you have a notion to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA notion! Do you think I am rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but there is no need of your working.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a need to me to feel independent. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be supported by\r\nmy aunts, while I know how to earn my own living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Mary, please, I beg of you, let me have the happiness of taking\r\ncare of you. Be my wife, I am not a rich man, but I have enough to\r\nprovide for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell, you surprise me. I thank you for the compliment you pay me\r\nwith your honorable offer, but I have no wish to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you reject me, Miss Mary? Tell me one thing; tell me truly, do you\r\ncare for any one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I care for nobody. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will marry some time. If you knew how very miserable you make\r\nme, I think you would not have the heart to refuse me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will get over it. I am going soon. Forget me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDarrell made no answer. He staggered out of the room and did not return\r\nuntil the following week, when Mary had left for Washington, accompanied\r\nby Letitia, her colored servant (called Tisha), who was devotedly\r\nattached to her.\r\n\r\nDarrell had become rather taciturn and less sociable than ever, Mrs.\r\nNewton noticed, and since Mary left he seemed to lose flesh and all his\r\nspirits, and passed the winter as if life were a burden to him. But when\r\nspring came, he brightened up a little, though he felt far from happy.\r\nAbout that time Mrs. Newton had a letter from Mary, saying that she was\r\ngoing to spend vacation in Maryland with her other aunt, and Tisha for\r\nher escort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe don\xe2\x80\x99t come here, because she fears I shall pester her life with my\r\nvisits. As she knows I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep away from her, she keeps away from\r\nyou. She hates me. I suppose you, too, will take to hating me, by and\r\nby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, when he heard that Mary was not coming that summer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo danger of that, William,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Newton replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is. You ought to hate me for driving her away. I hate myself\r\nworse than I hate the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t feel so. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it. But when did I ever do anything right, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know? I\r\nwish I could hate her as I hate myself, or as she hates me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam, she does not hate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know she don\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she would have told me. She is very truthful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it. She gave me my walking papers in a jiffy. I wish I could\r\nhate her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam, do you promise not to get angry, if I tell you why Mary\r\ndeclined your offer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay on. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t well make a burning furnace any hotter. I am too\r\nmad already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. She likes you, but is afraid of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfraid? afraid?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, aghast\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhy! that is awful! I, an object of\r\nfear, when I worship the ground she treads on! But, how? What have I\r\ndone? When did I frighten her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt no particular time; but often you gave her the impression that you\r\nhave a high temper, and she told me, \xe2\x80\x98If I loved Mr. Darrell better than\r\nmy life, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t marry him, for I could never be happy with a man of\r\na violent temper.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she spoke, too, of her being a Roman Catholic\r\nand you a Protestant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are a Catholic and uncle is Protestant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, I think the barrier is not insuperable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, my temper frightened her! It is awful!\xe2\x80\x9d He mused in silence for a\r\nfew minutes and then left the room.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after, he returned dressed for traveling, carrying a\r\nsatchel in one hand and a tin box under his arm. He put the box on the\r\ntable, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt Newton, I am going away for a few days. Please take care of this\r\nbox until I return or you hear from me. Good-by!\xe2\x80\x9d and he hurried away,\r\nfor he had only barely time to catch the train going to New York.\r\n\r\nDarrell was in New York for a few hours. He bought a finer suit of\r\nclothes, a very elegant light overcoat, hat and boots, and gloves to\r\nmatch, and thus equipped so elegantly that he hardly recognized himself,\r\nas he surveyed his figure in a large mirror of the furnishing store,\r\nwhere he was so metamorphosed, he took the night train for Washington.\r\n\r\nIt was early on a Sunday morning that Darrell arrived at Washington. He\r\nwent to a hotel, entered his name, took a room, a bath and a breakfast,\r\nand then called a hack to go in search of Mary. He knew that was not an\r\nhour for calling, but he had _business_ with Mary. His was no friendly\r\nvisit; it was a matter of life and death with him.\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell, and presently he heard Tisha\xe2\x80\x99s flapping steps coming.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLud a massa!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, stepping back. But recovering herself,\r\nsaid with true heartiness\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in the parlor, please. It is true glad Miss Mary will be to see\r\nye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so, Tisha?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it; no thinking about it, neither. She is going to mass; but\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99ll see you for a little while, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOpening the parlor door for Darrell to walk in, Tisha ran up stairs to\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh Miss Mary!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cguess who is down stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Tish, being so early and on Sunday, but I heard a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice. Is it a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet; ah! please excuse me, I mean sure as I live it is, and no\r\nother than Mr. Darrell, from New England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Mary, affecting indifference, but her hands trembled as\r\nshe tied her bonnet strings.\r\n\r\nDarrell knew he must appear self-contained and not in the least\r\nimpetuous, but when he saw those beautiful dark eyes of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s he forgot\r\nall his pretended calmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my aunt well?\xe2\x80\x9d Mary began as she came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, everybody is well; don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed at my coming, I know it\r\nmust seem strange to you. Two days ago I had no idea of coming to\r\nWashington, but Miss Moreneau, your aunt told me you were not coming\r\nNorth this summer, and this news nearly drove me crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Darrell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, don\xe2\x80\x99t drive me off yet. Your aunt told me that you refused me\r\nbecause you believe I have a violent temper. Now, I am not going to deny\r\nthat, but this I am going to say\xe2\x80\x94That I have never violated my word, and\r\nnever shall, and I make a most solemn oath to you, that if you will\r\nmarry me you shall never have occasion to be made unhappy or displeased\r\nby my quick anger, because you will only have to remind me of this\r\npledge, and I shall curb my temper, if it kills me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell, I believe you are perfectly sincere in what you say, but a\r\nstrong trait of character is not controlled easily. It is more apt to be\r\nuncontrollable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse me, I feel I must kill myself if you spurn\r\nme. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want life without you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary said, trying to keep calm, but she felt as if\r\nbeing carried away in spite of herself, by the torrent of his\r\nimpetuosity. She was afraid of him, but she liked him and she liked to\r\nbe loved in that passionate rebellious way of his; she smiled, adding,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwe must postpone this conversation for I must go to church, and it is\r\nquite a long walk there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe carriage that brought me is at the door, take it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t walk,\r\nit is quite warm out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go with me to church? You see, that is another obstacle; the\r\ndifference of religions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that is no obstacle; your religion tells you to pity me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will talk to Father White about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Mary, my beloved, will you give me hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you really try to control your anger when you feel it is\r\ngetting the mastery over you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, so help me God,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, lifting his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, that is an oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, and mean it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, much moved.\r\n\r\nThey went to church together. After church, Mary had a few moments\r\nconversation with her pastor. She explained everything to him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you\r\nlove him, my child,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the good father, knowing the human heart only\r\ntoo well. Mary blushed and said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father, I believe I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, send him to see me to-morrow morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDarrell had a long talk with Father White, and promised solemnly not to\r\ncoerce or influence his wife to change her religion, and that should\r\ntheir union be blessed with children, they should be baptized and\r\nbrought up Catholics.\r\n\r\nAnd his union was blessed. Mary made his New England home a paradise,\r\nand eight children, sharing largely their mother\xe2\x80\x99s fine qualities,\r\nfilled to overflowing his cup of happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\xe2\x80\x94_The Don\xe2\x80\x99s View of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there had been such a thing as communicating by telephone in the days\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9972, and there had been those magic wires spanning the distance\r\nbetween William Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s house in Alameda County and that of Don\r\nMariano Alamar in San Diego County, with power to transmit the human\r\nvoice for five hundred miles, a listener at either end would have heard\r\nvarious discussions upon the same subject, differentiated only by\r\ncircumstances. No magic wires crossed San Francisco bay to bring the\r\nsound of voices to San Diego, but the law of necessity made the Squatter\r\nand the Don, distant as they were\xe2\x80\x94distant in every way, without\r\nreckoning the miles between them\xe2\x80\x94talk quite warmly of the same matter.\r\nThe point of view was of course different, for how could it be\r\notherwise? Darrell thought himself justified, and _authorized_, to \xe2\x80\x9ctake\r\nup lands,\xe2\x80\x9d as he had done before. He had had more than half of\r\nCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s population on his side, and though the \xe2\x80\x9c_Squatter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nSovereignty_\xe2\x80\x9d was now rather on the wane, and the \xe2\x80\x9c_squatter vote_\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nno longer the power, still, the squatters would not abdicate, having yet\r\nmuch to say about election times.\r\n\r\nBut Darrell was no longer the active squatter that he had been. He\r\ncontrolled many votes yet, but in his heart he felt the weight which his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s sad eyes invariably put there when the talk was of litigating\r\nagainst a Mexican land title.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, Darrell honestly meant to take no land but what\r\nbelonged to the United States. His promise to his wife was sincere, yet\r\nhis coming to Southern California had already brought trouble to the\r\nAlamar rancho.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano Alamar was silently walking up and down the front piazza of\r\nhis house at the rancho; his hands listlessly clasped behind and his\r\nhead slightly bent forward in deep thought. He had pushed away to one\r\nside the many arm-chairs and wicker rockers with which the piazza was\r\nfurnished. He wanted a long space to walk. That his meditations were far\r\nfrom agreeable, could easily be seen by the compressed lips, slight\r\nfrown, and sad gaze of his mild and beautiful blue eyes. Sounds of\r\nlaughter, music and dancing came from the parlor; the young people were\r\nentertaining friends from town with their usual gay hospitality, and\r\nenjoying themselves heartily. Don Mariano, though already in his\r\nfiftieth year, was as fond of dancing as his sons and daughters, and not\r\nto see him come in and join the quadrille was so singular that his wife\r\nthought she must come out and inquire what could detain him. He was so\r\nabsorbed in his thoughts that he did not hear her voice calling him\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat keeps you away? Lizzie has been looking for you; she wants you for\r\na partner in the lancers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa, putting her arm under that\r\nof her husband, bending her head forward and turning it up to look into\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, stopping short, thus making her husband\r\ncome to a sudden halt. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure something has happened. Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, dear wife. Nothing has happened. That is to say, nothing new.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore squatters?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar bent his head slightly, in\r\naffirmative reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore coming, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, wife; more. Those two friends of squatters Mathews and Hager, who\r\nwere here last year to locate claims and went away, did not abandon\r\ntheir claims, but only went away to bring proselytes and their families,\r\nand a large invoice of them will arrive on to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s steamer. The\r\nworst of it all is, that among the new comers is that terrible and most\r\ndangerous squatter William Darrell, who some years ago gave so much\r\ntrouble to the Spanish people in Napa and Sonoma Counties, by locating\r\nclaims there. John Gasbang wrote to Hogsden that besides Darrell, there\r\nwill be six or seven other men bringing their families, so that there\r\nwill be more rifles for my cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we hear that Darrell was no longer a squatter, that he is\r\nrich and living quietly in Alameda?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we heard that, and it is true. He is quite well off, but Gasbang\r\nand Miller and Mathews went and told him that my rancho had been\r\nrejected, and that it is near enough to town to become valuable, as soon\r\nas we have a railroad. Darrell believed it, and is coming to locate\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrange that Darrell should believe such men; I suppose he does not\r\nknow how low they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to know them, for they were his teamsters when he crossed the\r\nplains in \xe2\x80\x9948. That is, Miller, Mathews, Hughes and Hager, were his\r\nteamsters, and Gasbang was their cook\xe2\x80\x94the cook for the hired men. Mrs.\r\nDarrell had a colored woman who cooked for the Darrell family; she\r\ndespised Gasbang\xe2\x80\x99s cooking as we despise his character, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa was silent, and holding to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s arm, took a turn\r\nwith him up and down the piazza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that there is no law to protect us; to protect our\r\nproperty; what does your lawyer say about obtaining redress or\r\nprotection; is there no hope?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProtection for our land, or for our cattle, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor both, as we get it for neither,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the matter of our land, we have to await for the attorney general,\r\nat Washington, to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizzie was telling Elvira, yesterday, that her uncle Lawrence is a\r\nfriend of several influential people in Washington, and that George can\r\nget him to interest himself in having your title decided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as George is to marry my daughter, he would be the last man from\r\nwhom I would ask a favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that I hear about not asking a favor from me?\xe2\x80\x9d said George\r\nMechlin, coming out on the piazza with Elvira on his arm, having just\r\nfinished a waltz\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI am interested to know why you would not ask it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know why, my dear boy. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the thing to bother you\r\nwith my disagreeable business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not? And who has a better right? And why should it be a bother\r\nto me to help you in any way I can? My father spoke to me about a\r\ndismissal of an appeal, and I made a note of it. Let me see, I think I\r\nhave it in my pocket now,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94said George, feeling in his breast pocket for\r\nhis memorandum book,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cyes, here it is,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98For uncle to write to the\r\nattorney general about dismissing the appeal taken by the squatters in\r\nthe Alamar grant, against Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s title, which was approved.\xe2\x80\x99 Is\r\nthat the correct idea? I only made this note to ask you for further\r\nparticulars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have it exactly. When I give you the number of the case, it is all\r\nthat you need say to your uncle. What I want is to have the appeal\r\ndismissed, of course, but if the attorney general does not see fit to do\r\nso, he can, at least, remand back the case for a new trial. Anything\r\nrather than this killing suspense. Killing literally, for while we are\r\nwaiting to have my title settled, the _settlers_ (I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to make\r\npuns), are killing my cattle by the hundred head, and I cannot stop\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are there no laws to protect property in California?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, some sort of laws, which in my case seem more intended to help the\r\nlaw-breakers than to protect the law-abiding,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so? Is there no law to punish the thieves who kill your cattle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some enactments so obviously intended to favor one class of\r\ncitizens against another class, that to call them laws is an insult to\r\nlaw, but such as they are, we must submit to them. By those laws any man\r\ncan come to my land, for instance, plant ten acres of grain, without any\r\nfence, and then catch my cattle which, seeing the green grass without a\r\nfence, will go to eat it. Then he puts them in a \xe2\x80\x98_corral_\xe2\x80\x99 and makes me\r\npay damages and so much per head for keeping them, and costs of legal\r\nproceedings and many other trumped up expenses, until for such little\r\nfields of grain I may be obliged to pay thousands of dollars. Or, if the\r\ngrain fields are large enough to bring more money by keeping the cattle\r\naway, then the settler shoots the cattle at any time without the least\r\nhesitation, only taking care that no one sees him in the act of firing\r\nupon the cattle. He might stand behind a bush or tree and fire, but then\r\nhe is not seen. No one can swear that they saw him actually kill the\r\ncattle, and no jury can convict him, for although the dead animals may\r\nbe there, lying on the ground shot, still no one saw the settler kill\r\nthem. And so it is all the time. I must pay damages and expenses of\r\nlitigation, or my cattle get killed almost every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is infamous. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you\xe2\x80\x94the cattle owners\xe2\x80\x94tried to have some\r\nlaw enacted that will protect your property?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to\r\nme that could be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt could be done, perhaps, if our positions were reversed, and the\r\nSpanish people\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98_the natives_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94were the planters of the grain fields,\r\nand the Americans were the owners of the cattle. But as we, the\r\nSpaniards, are the owners of the Spanish\xe2\x80\x94or Mexican\xe2\x80\x94land grants and also\r\nthe owners of the cattle ranchos, our State legislators will not make\r\nany law to protect cattle. They make laws \xe2\x80\x98_to protect agriculture_\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(they say proudly), which means to drive to the wall all owners of\r\ncattle ranchos. I am told that at this session of the legislature a law\r\nmore strict yet will be passed, which will be ostensibly \xe2\x80\x98to protect\r\nagriculture,\xe2\x80\x99 but in reality to destroy cattle and ruin the native\r\nCalifornians. The agriculture of this State does not require legislative\r\nprotection. Such pretext is absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that the rights of the Spanish people were protected by our\r\ntreaty with Mexico,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMexico did not pay much attention to the future welfare of the children\r\nshe left to their fate in the hands of a nation which had no sympathies\r\nfor us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa, feelingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember,\xe2\x80\x9d calmly said Don Mariano, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when I first read the text\r\nof the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, I felt a bitter resentment against\r\nmy people; against Mexico, the mother country, who abandoned us\xe2\x80\x94her\r\nchildren\xe2\x80\x94with so slight a provision of obligatory stipulations for\r\nprotection. But afterwards, upon mature reflection, I saw that Mexico\r\ndid as much as could have been reasonably expected at the time. In the\r\nvery preamble of the treaty the spirit of peace and friendship, which\r\nanimated both nations, was carefully made manifest. That spirit was to\r\nbe the _foundation_ of the relations between the conqueror and\r\nconquered. How could Mexico have foreseen then that when scarcely half a\r\ndozen years should have elapsed the trusted conquerors would, \xe2\x80\x98_In\r\nCongress Assembled_,\xe2\x80\x99 pass laws which were to be retroactive upon the\r\ndefenceless, helpless, conquered people, in order to despoil them? The\r\ntreaty said that our rights would be the same as those enjoyed by all\r\nother American citizens. But, you see, Congress takes very good care not\r\nto enact retroactive laws for Americans; laws to take away from American\r\ncitizens the property which they hold _now_, already, with a recognized\r\nlegal title. No, indeed. But they do so quickly enough with us\xe2\x80\x94with us,\r\nthe Spano-Americans, who were to enjoy equal rights, mind you, according\r\nto the treaty of peace. This is what seems to me a breach of faith,\r\nwhich Mexico could neither presuppose nor prevent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nothing else, I am sorry and ashamed to say,\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever knew much about the treaty with Mexico, but I never imagined we\r\nhad acted so badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think but few Americans know or believe to what extent we have been\r\nwronged by Congressional action. And truly, I believe that Congress\r\nitself did not anticipate the effect of its laws upon us, and how we\r\nwould be despoiled, we, the conquered people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the duty of law-givers to foresee the effect of the laws they\r\nimpose upon people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny, but I fear that the conquered have always but a weak\r\nvoice, which nobody hears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have had no one to\r\nspeak for us. By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo the American nation\r\npledged its honor to respect our land titles just the same as Mexico\r\nwould have done. Unfortunately, however, the discovery of gold brought\r\nto California the riff-raff of the world, and with it a horde of\r\nland-sharks, all possessing the privilege of voting, and most of them\r\ncoveting our lands, for which they very quickly began to clamor. There\r\nwas, and still is, plenty of good government land, which any one can\r\ntake. But no. The forbidden fruit is the sweetest. They do not want\r\ngovernment land. They want the land of the Spanish people, because we\r\n\xe2\x80\x98have too much,\xe2\x80\x99 they say. So, to win their votes, the votes of the\r\nsquatters, our representatives in Congress helped to pass laws declaring\r\nall lands in California open to pre-emption, as in Louisiana, for\r\ninstance. Then, as a coating of whitewash to the stain on the nation\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhonor, a \xe2\x80\x98land commission\xe2\x80\x99 was established to examine land titles.\r\nBecause, having pledged the national word to respect our rights, it\r\nwould be an act of despoliation, besides an open violation of pledged\r\nhonor, to take the lands without some pretext of a legal process. So\r\nthen, we became obliged to present our titles before the said land\r\ncommission to be examined and approved or rejected. While these legal\r\nproceedings are going on, the squatters locate their claims and raise\r\ncrops on our lands, which they convert into money to fight our titles.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t let me, with my disagreeable subject spoil your dance. Go back\r\nto your lancers, and tell Lizzie to excuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\nLizzie would not excuse him. With the privilege of a future\r\ndaughter-in-law, she insisted that Don Mariano should be her partner in\r\nthe lancers, which would be a far pleasanter occupation than to be\r\nwalking up and down the porch thinking about squatters.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano therefore followed Lizzie to their place in the dance.\r\nMercedes sat at the piano to play for them. The other couples took their\r\nrespective positions.\r\n\r\nThe well-balanced mind and kindly spirit of Don Mariano soon yielded to\r\nthe genial influences surrounding him. He would not bring his trouble to\r\nmar the pleasure of others. He danced with his children as gaily as the\r\ngayest. He insisted that Mr. Mechlin, too, should dance, and this\r\ngentleman graciously yielded and led Elvira through a quadrille,\r\nprotesting that he had not danced for twenty years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not danced because you were sick, but now you are well. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe lazy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would be paying to San Diego climate a very poor compliment by\r\nrefusing to dance now,\xe2\x80\x9d George added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so, papa. Show us how well you feel,\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzie said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to dance a hornpipe to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin answered,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nTo understand this remark better, the reader must know that Mr. James\r\nMechlin had come to San Diego, four years previously, a living skeleton,\r\nnot expected to last another winter. He had lost his health by a too\r\nclose application to business, and when he sought rest and relaxation\r\nhis constitution seemed permanently undermined. He tried the climate of\r\nFlorida. He spent several years in Italy and in the south of France, but\r\nhe felt no better. At last, believing his malady incurable, he returned\r\nto his New York home to die. In New York a friend, who also had been an\r\ninvalid, but whose health had been restored in Southern California,\r\nadvised him to try the salubrious air of San Diego. With but little\r\nhope, and only to please his family, Mr. Mechlin came to San Diego, and\r\nhis health improved so rapidly that he made up his mind to buy a country\r\nplace and make San Diego his home. William Mathews heard of this, and\r\noffered to sell his place on what Mr. Mechlin thought very moderate\r\nterms. A lawyer was employed to pass upon the title, and on his\r\nrecommendation the purchase was made. Mr. Mechlin had the Mathews house\r\nmoved back near the barn, and a new and much larger one built. When this\r\nwas finished the Mechlins moved into it, and Mr. Mechlin devoted himself\r\nto cultivating trees and flowers, and his health was bettered every day.\r\nThis was the compensation to his wife and two daughters for exiling\r\nthemselves from New York; for it was exile to Caroline and Lizzie to\r\ngive up their fine house in New York City to come and live on a\r\nCalifornia rancho.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, these two young ladies passed their time more pleasantly,\r\nafter making the acquaintance of the Alamar family, and soon their\r\nacquaintance ripened into friendship, to be made closer by the intended\r\nmarriage of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x94Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son\xe2\x80\x94to Lizzie. Shortly after,\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s only son\xe2\x80\x94came on a visit, and when he returned to\r\nNew York he was already engaged to Elvira, third daughter of Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nAlamar.\r\n\r\nNow, George Mechlin was making his second visit to his family. He had\r\nfound New York so very dull and stupid on his return from California\r\nthat when Christmas was approaching he told his uncle and aunt\xe2\x80\x94with whom\r\nhe lived\xe2\x80\x94that he wanted to go and spend Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day\r\nwith his family in California.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I wish I could go with you. Give my love to James, and tell\r\nhim I am delighted at his getting so well,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lawrence Mechlin said,\r\nand George had his leave of absence. Mr. Lawrence Mechlin was president\r\nof the bank of which George was cashier, so it was not difficult for him\r\nto get the assistant cashier to attend to his duties when he was away,\r\nparticularly as the assistant cashier himself was George\xe2\x80\x99s most devoted\r\nfriend. George could have only twelve days in California, but to see\r\nElvira for even so short a time he would have traveled a much longer\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nMr. James Mechlin affirmed repeatedly that he owed his improved health\r\nto the genial society of the Alamar family as much as to the genial\r\nclimate of San Diego County. Mr. Mechlin, however, was not the only one\r\nwho had paid the same tribute to that most delightful family, the most\r\ncharming of which\xe2\x80\x94the majority vote said\xe2\x80\x94was Don Mariano himself. His\r\nnobility of character and great kindness of heart were well known to\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nThe Alamar family was quite patriarchal in size, if the collateral\r\nbranches be taken into account, for there were many brothers, nephews\r\nand nieces. These, however, lived in the adjoining rancho, and yet\r\nanother branch in Lower California, in Mexico. Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nimmediate family was composed of his wife and six children, two sons and\r\nfour daughters.\r\n\r\nAll of these, as we have seen, were having a dance. The music was\r\nfurnished by the young ladies themselves, taking their turn at the\r\npiano, assisted by Madam Halier (Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 French governess), who was\r\nalways ready to play for the girls to dance. Besides the Mechlins, there\r\nwere three or four young gentlemen from town, but there were so many\r\nAlamares (brothers, nieces and nephews, besides) that the room seemed\r\nquite well filled. Such family gatherings were frequent, making the\r\nAlamar house very gay and pleasant.\r\n\r\nGeorge Mechlin would have liked to prolong his visit, but he could not.\r\nHe consoled himself looking forward to the ninth of June, when he would\r\ncome again to make a visit of two months\xe2\x80\x99 duration. On his return East,\r\nbefore renewing his duties at the bank, he went to Washington to see\r\nabout the dismissal of the appeal. Unfortunately, the attorney general\r\nhad to absent himself about that time, and the matter being left with\r\nthe solicitor general, nothing was done. George explained to Don Mariano\r\nhow the matter was delayed, and his case remained undecided yet for\r\nanother year longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\xe2\x80\x94_Pre-empting under the Law._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll aboard for San Diego!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted a voice from a wagon, as it rumbled\r\npast Darrell, who walked leisurely with a satchel in his hand, swinging\r\nit unconsciously, lost in thought. He looked up and saw that the wagon\r\nwhence the voice came carried ten or twelve men, sitting on trunks and\r\npackages and carpet-bags. These men Mathews and Gasbang had presented to\r\nhim, saying that they were settlers already residing at the Alamar\r\nrancho, and others who were going down to take up claims, at the same\r\ntime that he would locate his. Darrell looked at his future neighbors\r\nwith feelings of anything but pleasure. The broad, vulgar face of\r\nGasbang, with its square jaws, gray beard, closely clipped, but never\r\nshaved, his compressed, thin, bloodless lips, his small, pale, restless\r\neyes and flat nose, Darrell soon recognized, though the wagon was going\r\nrapidly. Mathews\xe2\x80\x99 visage was equally noticeable for its ugliness, though\r\nof a different type; for his face was long and shaved; his nose was\r\npinched and peaked and red; his cheeks were flabby; and his long, oily,\r\ndusty, hair dragged over his neck in matted, meshy locks, while a\r\nconstant frown settled on his brow. As he was broad-shouldered and\r\nrather tall, his face seemed made for some other man much weaker than\r\nhimself. His face looked mean and discontented, while his body seemed\r\nstrong and self-reliant.\r\n\r\nThe wagon had arrived and gone away, and the men had walked aboard the\r\nboat, when Darrell, still swinging his satchel abstractedly, stood on\r\nthe wharf looking at the steamer as if not quite resolved to go. He felt\r\nno sympathy, no liking, for any of those men with whom he was now\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nIt was different to have Gasbang as his hired man, as before, but now he\r\nwas not under orders, and was much older. Years, moreover, had not\r\nimproved his low nature. Darrell had no higher opinion of the others. He\r\nwas sure these were not the sort of people whom his wife would like to\r\nhave for neighbors. He felt self-accused and irresolute. A shout from\r\nGasbang, who was observing him from the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s deck, made Darrell\r\nlook up quickly, ashamed of having betrayed his irresolution. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\r\nreturn immediately, if things don\xe2\x80\x99t suit me,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, walking\r\ntowards the gang-plank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on. Your luggage is all aboard, I took care of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said,\r\ncoming to meet him. He snatched Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s satchel, in friendly\r\nobsequiousness, to carry it for him. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along; you\xe2\x80\x99ll be left,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, and Darrell followed him, half-disgusted at his vulgar\r\nofficiousness. \xe2\x80\x9cI got your berth for you. The steamer is so crowded,\r\nthat men have to be crammed into rooms by the bunch, so you and I and\r\nMathews must room together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, with a shiver of disgust, and went to\r\ntake a seat on deck where he could be alone.\r\n\r\nThe bustle and hurry of getting off was over at last, and the steamer\r\nwas furrowing her way through the spacious bay of San Francisco towards\r\nthe Golden Gate. Groups of passengers stood here and there, admiring the\r\nbeautiful harbor and its surrounding country. Darrell sat alone, fixing\r\nhis gaze upon the receding verdure of Alameda County. Above that green,\r\nundulating line of diminishing hills, which seemed to fly from him,\r\nDarrell could see plainly one face, one form, beautiful to him as none\r\nother could be, the face and form of his wife, his beloved Mary. This\r\nwas the first time he had ever left her for any longer time than a two\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 absence, since they were married. Now he might be absent several\r\nmonths, for if he decided to locate in San Diego County, he would first\r\nbuild a house before he sent for his family. He would first send for\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x94his eldest son\xe2\x80\x94and then, when a comfortable home was prepared,\r\nthe family would come.\r\n\r\nThe voyage down the coast was made safely. Darrell had managed to keep\r\naway from his fellow-travelers, to think of home unmolested.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright morning of January, 1872, when he stood far forward,\r\nwatching the course of the steamer Orizaba, as she made her way around\r\nPoint Loma, then between Ballast Point and the sandy peninsula, and\r\npassing by La Playa, came in sight of San Diego city.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere we are,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Gasbang; \xe2\x80\x9chow do you like the looks of our\r\nlittle city, Mr. Darrell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; it is larger than I supposed, and the site of it seems very\r\npleasant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPleasant! I should say it was. A perfect slope, sir, as gentle and\r\nregular as if made to order. The best drained city in the world, sir,\r\nwhen we put in sewers. Too poor for that, yet, sir, but we are coming to\r\nit, sir, growing, growing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we get the railroad,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mathews, with a mouth full of tobacco,\r\nspitting profusely on the deck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have that. Our news from Washington is very\r\nencouraging. Tom Scott will visit us this summer,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like a town with plenty of trees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, with his gaze fixed\r\non the approaching panorama, thinking that his wife would be pleased\r\nwith the place, she being so fond of trees. \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea you had so\r\nmany trees about you. Many are small, yet, but all seem healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd health-giving trees, they are, too. Most of them are eucalyptus and\r\npepper trees, the healthiest in the world. You never hear of any\r\nmalarial fevers in San Diego, sir, never. Our perfect climate, the fine\r\nsloping ground of our town site, our eucalyptus trees, sea breezes and\r\nmountain air, make San Diego a most healthy little city,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is an excellent recommendation, as life is not worth having\r\nwithout health,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have it here,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said. \xe2\x80\x9cA man has to be very imprudent not to\r\nkeep well in our climate, sir. All we want now is a little stimulus of\r\nbusiness prosperity, and the railroad is sure to bring us that. Then San\r\nDiego will be the best place on the coast for a residence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe loud report of a cannon, close by, made Darrell jump and look around\r\nquickly, not knowing what that explosion could mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is our visiting card to the people of San Diego, to announce our\r\ncoming,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, laughingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry it startled you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is nothing. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I had nerves. I believe that is what\r\nwomen call it. I was not expecting such a military salute,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, we always give it. The San Diego people are very military. At\r\nleast, I should say the settlers on Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar\xe2\x80\x99s rancho are, as I hear\r\nthey practice rifle shooting there all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain said,\r\nlooking at Mathews and Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a shot at us,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang answered, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is a blank cartridge, meant not to hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rifle practice is in dark nights,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young Spaniard, who had\r\nbeen listening at what was said by the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr in the daytime, if the cattle deserve it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very creditable and brave, to shoot tame cows,\xe2\x80\x9d the Spaniard\r\nrejoined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you had better come and try it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. It is the mischievous brutes I would like to shoot, not the\r\ngood, useful cattle;\xe2\x80\x9d so saying, the Spaniard walked away, followed by\r\nthe scowls of the settlers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is impudence for you,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose greasers ain\xe2\x80\x99t half crushed yet. We have to tame them like they\r\ndo their mustangs, or shoot them, as we shoot their cattle,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no. No such violent means are necessary. All we have to do is to\r\ntake their lands, and finish their cattle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes, sneeringly,\r\nlooking at Darrell for approval. But he did not get it. Darrell did not\r\ncare for the Spanish population of California, but he did not approve of\r\nshooting cattle in the way which the foregoing conversation indicated.\r\nTo do this, was useless cruelty and useless waste of valuable property,\r\nno matter to whom it might belong. To destroy it was a loss to the\r\nState. It was folly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must cattle be shot? Can\xe2\x80\x99t they be kept off, away from your crops\r\nwithout shooting them?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot always. At first, that is, for the first three years after we\r\nlocated our claims,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said; \xe2\x80\x9cwe had to shoot them all the time.\r\nNow the Don has sold a good many, or sent them to the mountains, so that\r\nfew have been killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose fencing would be too expensive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhew! It would be ruinous, impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mechlin is the only one who has attempted to put up any fences,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRomeo said, who had been listening in silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did so, because he is an old hypocrite,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause his daughter Lizzie is going to marry Gabriel Alamar, and of\r\ncourse, they have to be on friendly terms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat ain\xe2\x80\x99t the reason. He fenced a hundred acres the first year, and he\r\nnever sows outside, so that he\xe2\x80\x99s not at all troubled by the Don\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncattle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Gabriel is going to marry Lizzie all the same, and the two families\r\nare as thick as can be. Old Mechlin has gone back on us. I wish he would\r\ngo away,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should he go? He paid a very good price for his farm, and has made\r\nmany improvements,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho did he buy from?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom me. I sold him that claim, and took up another a mile up the\r\nvalley,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a good bargain it was, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo observed.\r\n\r\nMathews gave him a black look, but made no answer.\r\n\r\nThe steamer had now reached the wharf. The deck was filled with\r\npassengers and their baggage ready for shore. Pittikin, with wife and\r\ndaughters blonde and freckled, and Hughes, with his wife and daughters\r\ndark and gypsy-looking, were all there, ready for their drive to Alamar.\r\n\r\nThere were several wagons, light and heavy, waiting to convey the\r\nnewly-arrived and their luggage to the Alamar rancho. Darrell, having\r\nhis choice of conveyances, preferred to go in a light wagon with Romeo\r\nHancock, but Gasbang and Mathews joined him. Miller and Hager had come\r\nto meet their prodigal sons, who had been in San Francisco for several\r\nmonths, when they had permission to remain only a few weeks. But they\r\nhad fallen into Peter Roper\xe2\x80\x99s company, and that individual had\r\nrepresented the fascinations of whiskey most alluringly to them,\r\nadvising them to have a good time now that they had the opportunity.\r\nThey yielded to the tempter, and now had returned home like repentant\r\nprodigals.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours Darrell was driving by Don Mariano Alamar\xe2\x80\x99s house, a\r\none-story mansion on a low hill, with a broad piazza in front, and in\r\nthe interior a court formed by two wings, and a row of rooms variously\r\noccupied at its back. That the house was commodious, Darrell could see.\r\nThere was a flower garden in front. At the back there were several\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_corrales_\xe2\x80\x9d for cattle and horses. At the foot of the hill, on the\r\nleft, there was an orchard, and some grain fields enclosed with good\r\nfences.\r\n\r\nDarrell took notice of all these particulars. He also noticed that there\r\nwere females on the front piazza. He was taken to see the best\r\nunoccupied lands to make his selection. He ran his practiced eye over\r\nthe valley from the highest point on the hill. He then came to the next\r\nbench; he stopped there, also, and finally came to the broad slope of\r\nthe foothills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ll locate here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif no one else has already filed a\r\nclaim to this land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis he said to his fellow-settlers, all being present, addressing all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I have no objection,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I, neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say, Pittikin and Mathews?\r\nDo you know _if_ this land is located, or who done it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMathews shook his head in the negative, and kept on chewing his tobacco\r\nin silence.\r\n\r\nPittikin said, \xe2\x80\x9cI reckon nobody is located here, and if they _done it_,\r\nwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t they leave stakes? They leave no stakes, no notice to\r\nsettlers; they can\xe2\x80\x99t make any row if somebody else takes the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I want to respect everybody\xe2\x80\x99s right; so I want you all to bear\r\nwitness, that I found no stakes or notices of anybody. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\njump anybody\xe2\x80\x99s claim; I want a fair deal. I shall locate two claims\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x94one in my own name and one for my oldest son, Clarence,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDarrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll take 320 acres?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, 320 acres,\xe2\x80\x94according to law,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Let us measure them now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have time to\r\nmark the limits and put the corner stakes. I have a cord here in my\r\nwagon, which is a chain\xe2\x80\x99s length. That will do the business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do temporarily, I suppose; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have the two claims\r\nproperly surveyed afterwards according to law,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, you will. We all know you will do the fair thing by\r\neverybody, and follow the law strictly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes. In which opinion\r\nall concurred.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you all made your selections?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Pittikin and I will locate near Hancock. We like that valley; it\r\nis further off, but better soil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes. \xe2\x80\x9cMy oldest boy will put a\r\nclaim near me, and Miller\xe2\x80\x99s two boys have staked theirs also. I think\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll like that location better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you like it. I think this is good enough soil for me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDarrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good enough for anybody. The whole rancho is all good soil. Let\r\nus put the stakes now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang; and assisted by Mathews, Romeo\r\nHancock and Sumner Pittikin, Darrell proceeded by making a rough guess\r\nto measure 320 acres (more or less), and put the corner stakes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I call business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang, carrying cheerfully one\r\nend of the rope used for measurement; \xe2\x80\x9cand all inside of the law. That\r\nis the beauty of it\xe2\x80\x94all perfectly lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd so it was.\r\n\r\nThe stakes having been placed, Darrell felt satisfied. Next day he would\r\nhave the claim properly filed, and in due time a surveyor would measure\r\nthem. All would be done \xe2\x80\x9caccording to law,\xe2\x80\x9d and in this easy way more\r\nland was taken from its legitimate owner.\r\n\r\nThis certainly was a more simple way of appropriating the property of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_the conquered_\xe2\x80\x9d than in the days of Alaric or Hannibal.\r\n\r\nThere would have been bloodshed then. Now tears only flowed; silent\r\ntears of helpless discouragement; of a presentiment of impending\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nSadly Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa and her daughters had witnessed from the half-closed\r\nshutters of their bedroom windows Mr. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s performance, and fully\r\nanticipated serious trouble therefrom.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano Alamar, Gabriel and Victoriano\xe2\x80\x94his two sons\xe2\x80\x94had also\r\nsilently witnessed Mr. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s _lawful_ appropriation of their own\r\nproperty. Gabriel was pale and calm. Victoriano was biting his lips, and\r\nhis face was flushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe government has for sale hundreds of millions of acres, but yet\r\nthese men must come and take my land, as if there was no other,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Mariano, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as we pay the taxes on the land that they will cultivate, our taxes\r\nwill double next year,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. That climax to injustice has been the most fatal of all\r\nthe hardships imposed upon us. George could not believe me when I told\r\nhim that we (the land-owners) have to pay the taxes on the land\r\ncultivated by the pre-emptors, and upon all the improvements they make\r\nand enjoy. When he at last understood that such unfair laws did exist,\r\nhe was amazed, but understood then why the settlers wished to prolong\r\nlitigation, since it is \xe2\x80\x98_the natives_\xe2\x80\x99 who must bear the burden of\r\ntaxation, while the titles are in the courts, and thus the pre-emptors\r\nhold the land free.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish we were squatters,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring litigation, yes; but there have been cases where honest men\r\nhave, in good faith, taken lands as squatters, and after all, had to\r\ngive them up. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame the squatters; they are at times like\r\nourselves, victims of a wrong legislation, which unintentionally cuts\r\nboth ways. They were set loose upon us, but a law without equity recoils\r\nupon them more cruelly. Then we are all sufferers, all victims of a\r\ndefective legislation and subverted moral principles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\xe2\x80\x94_Efforts to Right the Wrong._\r\n\r\n\r\nDarrell was not the man to make any delay in putting into practice a\r\nproject, when once adopted. He therefore immediately wrote home saying\r\nthat he \xe2\x80\x9chad located,\xe2\x80\x9d and wished Clarence to come down as soon as home\r\nmatters permitted it. All the crops must be in first, so that Everett\r\nand Webster could take care of the farm when Clarence left. They had two\r\ngood farm hands and a man to take care of the dairy, but still, Darrell\r\nmade his boys give their personal attention to all the work on the farm.\r\nHe wrote to Clarence that he would build a small house quickly, which\r\nafterwards could be used for the hired men, and would wait until he came\r\ndown to begin building their dwelling house. That he would level the\r\nground for the house, sink a couple of wells and put up two windmills,\r\nthe running stream not being sufficient.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I had better buy the lumber for the house up here and charter a\r\nschooner to send it down,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said to his mother, after reading\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he say anything to you about the condition of the title?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nDarrell asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a word. I suppose the land is vacant,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied. Mrs.\r\nDarrell shook her head, as if in doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to see to that, before there is any house built in which I\r\nshall be expected to reside,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing you do when you\r\nget there is to inquire whether the land has been finally rejected and\r\nthere is no litigation for it. If there is, I want you to pay for it to\r\nthe owner. And if he will not or cannot sell, write to me at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, mother, I shall do as you say, and I assure you I do not\r\nwish father to take up any land claimed by any one under a Mexican\r\ntitle. I think those Spanish people ought to be allowed to keep the land\r\nthat their government gave them. We ought not to have made any laws that\r\nwould place their titles in a bad light and be questioned. We should\r\nhave accepted the legality they had before their own Mexican government,\r\nwithout making some other legality requisite, to please ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nClarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat has always been my opinion, but I have failed to convince your\r\nfather. However, with our combined efforts, we might dissuade him from\r\nhis present way of thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Darrell.\r\n\r\nClarence would not be able to leave home for a few weeks yet. In the\r\nmeantime, his father had not been idle, he had lost no time in carrying\r\nout his plans, and shortly after making his \xe2\x80\x9clocation\xe2\x80\x9d in the manner\r\ndescribed, he had several men engaged in different employments at his\r\nplace. When he had already begun building the small house, of which he\r\nspoke in his letter to Clarence, Don Mariano, accompanied by his two\r\nsons, rode up to the place where he was then superintending his workmen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mr. Darrell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell answered, laconically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I speak a few words with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, going a few steps nearer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you have taken up some land here, and I suppose you think it is\r\ngovernment land, but if so, you are misinformed. This land belongs to\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it reported rejected then? I have seen the law report, stating\r\nthat your title was rejected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know that such is the case. For some mistake or other the entry\r\nwas made placing my title in the list of those rejected, but I assure\r\nyou that it is a mistake. My title is now before the attorney general in\r\nWashington, because, having been approved, the settlers took an appeal.\r\nIf the attorney general sustains the appeal, I suppose he will remand\r\nthe case for a new trial, but I have reasons to suppose he will dismiss\r\nthe appeal and affirm the decision of the District Court in my favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly we will; meantime I thought it was best to undeceive you,\r\nand give you warning that you are building on my land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour land if you get it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew the condition of my title I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that you would\r\ndoubt that this land is mine. However, all I wish to do is to prevent\r\nyou from spending money here and then naturally get into litigation with\r\nme to defend your property,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\nDarrell thought of his wife, and her earnest injunctions. He wished to\r\nkeep his promise to her. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf the courts say that this land rightfully belongs to you, I shall pay\r\nyou for your land or vacate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Darrell, you will get me into litigation with you, and I wish\r\nto avoid that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I shall not get you into any law suit with me. I shall buy your\r\nland or leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Mr. Darrell, I shall rely on your word. I shall remember\r\nwhat you say; please do the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the habit of forgetting what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano and his two sons lifted their hats, bowed slightly, turned\r\ntheir horses\xe2\x80\x99 heads and moved off.\r\n\r\nDarrell returned their bow, muttering to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThey take off their\r\nhats and bow like gentlemen, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was talking with Don Mariano, Mathews, Hughes, Gasbang, Miller\r\nand Pittikin had come. They heard all that was said and looked\r\ndisappointed. They evidently had counted upon Darrell to help them to\r\nfight the rightful owner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I understand you to say to the Don that you will not maintain your\r\nclaim, if the attorney general dismisses our appeal?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you understood, or what you did not understand. What\r\nI said was that if the Don\xe2\x80\x99s title is decided to be right and legal, I\r\nshall not contest it. Why should I, if the land is his? I came here to\r\ntake up government land, believing his title was rejected. He says it is\r\nnot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lies; it was rejected,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why we appealed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; we will wait. For my part, I think that if his title was\r\nrejected he will find it hard to get it back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell.\r\n\r\nThe fact of his going on with his building ought to have been sufficient\r\nproof to the other settlers that he had cast his lot with them. But it\r\nwas not. They feared that at any time he might pay the Don for his land,\r\nand cease to be one of them; cease to be a \xe2\x80\x9c_squatter_.\xe2\x80\x9d These doubts,\r\nthese fears, were the perennial theme of endless discussion with the\r\nsettlers of Alamar.\r\n\r\nWith date of February 14, 1872, the Honorable Legislature of California\r\npassed a law \xe2\x80\x9c_To protect agriculture, and to prevent the trespassing of\r\nanimals upon private property in the County of Los Angeles, and the\r\nCounty of San Diego, and parts of Monterey County_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the very first section it recited, that \xe2\x80\x9cevery owner _or occupant_ of\r\nland, _whether it is enclosed or not_,\xe2\x80\x9d could take up cattle found in\r\nsaid land, etc., etc. It was not stated to be necessary that the\r\n_occupant_ should have a good title. All that was required seemed to be\r\nthat he should _claim to be an occupant_ of land, no matter who was the\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nBefore this law came out, Don Mariano had already had a great deal of\r\ntrouble with the squatters, who kept killing his cattle by the hundred\r\nhead at times. After this law passed, he had the additional annoyance of\r\nhaving to pay money for the release of cattle taken up by _occupants_\r\nwho would not fence their ten-acre crops. Thus, the alternative was,\r\nthat if cattle were not taken up, he was sure to find them shot dead by\r\nsome invisible hand. He had hoped that the Legislature would pass a law\r\nsaying that \xe2\x80\x9cunless _occupants_ of land put fences around their fields,\r\nthey would not be authorized to take up cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d But, instead of this,\r\nthe above-mentioned law was enacted.\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, ruinous to Don Mariano, as well as to all owners of\r\ncattle ranchos where settlers had seen fit to locate homesteads. Now any\r\none man, by planting _one acre_ of grain to attract cattle to it, could\r\nmake useless thousands of acres around it of excellent grazing, because\r\nit became necessary to drive cattle away from the vicinity of these\r\nunfenced fields.\r\n\r\nIn view of all this, and seeing that the new law would confirm the right\r\nto plant fields without fencing, and take up cattle, horses or any other\r\nanimals found therein, Don Mariano thought he would call together all\r\nthe settlers in his rancho, and make some proposition to them that would\r\nbe fair to everybody, and by which he would save his cattle from getting\r\nkilled or captured (when he must ransom them) all the time.\r\n\r\nHe told his idea to Mr. Mechlin, who thought it was a good plan, and\r\nvolunteered to see some of the settlers with whom he was acquainted,\r\nthinking that these could see others, and in this manner a meeting be\r\narranged. He started in the morning on his errand, and in the evening\r\nDon Mariano called to learn the result.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese men are meaner and lower than I had supposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin,\r\nwhose very fine nervous organization ill-fitted him for the rough\r\ncontact of Gasbangs. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you believe it, they suspected I wanted to\r\nlay a trap in which the innocent lambs would fall, and you\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nwolf\xe2\x80\x94catch them. If it had not been that I saw Darrell, I would have\r\nbeen utterly discouraged. And I suspect he would not have been half so\r\npolite and considerate but for the influence of his son, who has just\r\narrived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard he had. You saw him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and a very gentlemanly, handsome young fellow he is. He made his\r\nfather promise to go with him to see the settlers in person, and arrange\r\nfor you to meet them; he will report to me in the evening the result of\r\ntheir embassy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence kept his word to Mr. Mechlin, and immediately after breakfast\r\nhe had his buggy and horses (a fine turnout he had brought from San\r\nFrancisco) at the door. Darrell smiled, and good-naturedly took his seat\r\nbeside his son, saying it would be best to begin by seeing Gasbang and\r\nMathews. Fortunately they met these men, who were driving to see him, to\r\nask his opinion about agreeing to meet Don Mariano. Darrell promptly\r\ntold them that he thought no one of the settlers should refuse a request\r\nso easy to grant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you think there is a trap in it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever. We are not children,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose he makes us promise something?\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews argued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can he coerce any one against his will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will be obliged to accede unwillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\nat least be courteous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Have you any idea what it is that he wants to say?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nGasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe wants to make some proposition to the settlers, by which he hopes\r\nthat the interests of all concerned will be subserved,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVisionary!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Gasbang, tapping his forehead with his\r\nforefinger; \xe2\x80\x9cnot practical.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut his intentions are perfectly kind and fair,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, Mr. Mechlin thinks they are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be? He certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t coerce anybody. Here we are\r\non what he believes to be his land, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is. Well, what\r\nof that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t propose to fight us single-handed. We are the\r\nmajority,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see Hager and Miller, and the other fellows in that\r\nvalley. But we think Mr. Clarence will do better with Hancock, Pittikin\r\nand Hughes. The female element is strong there, but it will weaken in\r\nhis hands, and in that malleable condition, he can shape it to suit\r\nhimself, with one look out of his eyes at the whole troop of girls,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness! You don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose I would go to play the sweet fellow to\r\nthose ugly old girls, and make a fool of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, with so\r\ngenuine a look of thorough disgust, that it made John Gasbang indulge in\r\none of his loudest fits of hilarity. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, my young friend.\r\nThere is no harm for you there. I could turn you loose among those girls\r\nand you would be as safe as Daniel among \xe2\x80\x98lions\xe2\x80\x99 or in \xe2\x80\x98fiery furnace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYou would not get a single scratch, or feel any flames at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a low, vulgar fellow this is, even too low for a squatter,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClarence, driving off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhew!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated the elder Darrell, \xe2\x80\x9cyou speak like _a Don_. Your idea\r\nof _a squatter_ is not flattering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is flattering thus far, that I think Gasbang is too low for the\r\nsettler, who means no wrong-doing,\xe2\x80\x94the average squatter. As for Mathews,\r\nI am sure he is a cut-throat by instinct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be; but I think their idea of your seeing Pittikin and Hughes\r\nis good. You can have more effect on them than Gasbang or Mathews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I am willing to go to speak to the old men, but why should I see the\r\ngirls?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou manage that part to suit yourself. And now stop. I\xe2\x80\x99ll drop here;\r\nyou needn\xe2\x80\x99t go out of your way. I\xe2\x80\x99ll walk home. I want to see this piece\r\nof land near by. It has not been located. I might put a claim there for\r\nEverett and another for Webster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence sighed, and silently drove on. He had passed by the Pittikin\r\nand Hughes farms the day he arrived, as his father had taken him to see\r\nhow nicely the settlers were doing in Southern California; all expecting\r\ntheir prosperity to increase by the building of the railroad. Clarence\r\nsaw the two houses and began to feel like a mariner of old between\r\nScylla and Charybdis. There might be a troop of ugly old girls in each\r\nhouse. If he could only see some men out in the fields. But the fields\r\nlooked deserted. Where could the men be\xe2\x80\x94this being no Sunday nor Fourth\r\nof July, that they should leave off work? On looking about for some\r\nhuman being to guide him, he saw in the distance, under a clump of dark\r\ntrees, several wagons, and horses unhitched, standing harnessed near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe was about to turn to the left, to take the road between two fields,\r\nwhen he heard voices, shouting loudly. He supposed they were calling\r\nsome one. The shouts were followed by a man on horseback galloping\r\ntowards him. Clarence stopped and waited. The rider was no other than\r\nMr. Pittikin, who came in person to invite him to join their picnic, in\r\nhonor of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s wedding. The opportunity to see _the men_\r\ntogether would be excellent, but the _girls_ would be there, too,\r\nthought Clarence, not over pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease excuse me, I am not dressed to appear in company. I came to see\r\nyou on business,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girls said I must bring you.\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence felt a qualm. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even if I\r\nhave to fight you I must obey; obey the ladies, you know. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmany there. Only our two families\xe2\x80\x94Hughes and mine, and neighbor\r\nHancock\xe2\x80\x99s and a few friends. Indeed, we will feel slighted if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\njoin us. We will feel you think us too humble a class for you to\r\nassociate with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the kind. If I thought so, I would not hesitate to present\r\nmyself before the ladies in this dress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along, anyhow. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make all the allowance you want. But you see,\r\nthis is my daughter Fanny\xe2\x80\x99s birthday and her wedding day. She was\r\nmarried to Romeo Hancock this morning. So we wanted a room as big as all\r\nout doors to celebrate the occasion. We thought the best thing would be\r\nto have a picnic under those beautiful trees. Come, please. If you ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwith us, you are against us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go home and put on other dress and come back immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClarence.\r\n\r\nPittikin laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cJust what Fanny said. I tell you she is an awfully\r\nsmart girl. She said, \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you he is going home to change his\r\nclothes, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you let him, because he\xe2\x80\x99ll only give us the slip.\xe2\x80\x99 So\r\nyou see, I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you go. Besides, they are setting the table,\xe2\x80\x94I mean\r\nto say, spreading the eatables,\xe2\x80\x94so you have no time to go home now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, look here, Mr. Pittikin, what is to become of my mission? I came\r\nto see you and Mr. Hughes on business, and not on a picnic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t the business wait till to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot very well, as I promised Mr. Mechlin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I know; Hughes told me,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Pittikin. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Don wants to\r\nmake speeches to the settlers to fool us into a\xe2\x80\x94into\xe2\x80\x94some terms of his,\r\nso that we\xe2\x80\x99ll kick ourselves out of our farms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the kind. He is not going to make any foolish propositions,\r\nbut even if he were, you can lose nothing by being polite and listening\r\nto him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know but what you are right. I like always to be polite; and as\r\nfor Hughes, he is the politest man going, and no mistake. He never\r\nspeaks loud, and he always listens to you. I think it will be the best\r\nthing, perhaps, to see Hughes, now. Then there is neighbor Hancock, and\r\nneighbor Miller and Jackson, and the boys. Come along, we\xe2\x80\x99ll collar them\r\nin a bunch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I can count upon your help?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly you can; for when it is a question of politeness, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\nleft behind, and if I give you my word, you can bet on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence was received with loud demonstrations of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pittikin, on arriving at the picnic ground; \xe2\x80\x9cI got\r\nhim; but as he has some business to talk to us about, I promised him we\r\nwould attend to that too, and mix business with pleasure, as it were.\r\nSo, you talk to them girls, Mr. Darrell, while we old men see what can\r\nbe done and how, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence was presented by Mr. Pittikin to Mrs. Pittikin, and this lady\r\npresented him to the company, saying that he must make himself at home,\r\nwhich Clarence did not see well how he could do.\r\n\r\nBut the young ladies could not boast of having often the good fortune to\r\nentertain a young gentleman as elegant, handsome and rich as Clarence,\r\nand they made good use of their golden opportunity. Sweet glances and\r\ncomplimentary expressions of pleasure, because the Darrell family were\r\nto be their neighbors, showered upon him, until he was ready to laugh\r\noutright. But he was too kind to have done anything so discourteous, and\r\ntook it all in good part, thinking it was all meant in kindness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, let us show to Mr. Darrell our ice fountain; it is, I think, a\r\ngreat natural curiosity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Romeo Hancock, the heroine of the\r\nday, being the lady in whose honor the hymeneal festivities took place.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome girls and boys,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and accompanied by Clarence, and\r\nfollowed by eight or ten others, she guided them to a little cave under\r\na large oak, from which a muffled sound of tiny bells that seemed to\r\ntinkle and sigh and whisper, came forth. It seemed to Clarence as if the\r\nlittle fountain was in sympathy with the dispossessed owners, but did\r\nnot dare to raise its timid voice in behalf of the vanquished, who no\r\nlonger had rights in their patrimony, and must henceforth wander off\r\ndisinherited, despoiled, forgotten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a lovely place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and Mathews wanted to kill me for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he had just sold his place to Mr. Mechlin, intending to locate\r\nhere. So when he went to town to sign his conveyance, I put some boards\r\nin a wagon and came here, and in two hours my father and myself had put\r\nup my cabin. Then we put up this fence around one acre, and by nightfall\r\nwe had placed my boundary stakes. That night I brought my blankets and\r\nmy rifle, to sleep in my cabin. Mother sent father to keep me company,\r\nand we slept soundly, in splendid style. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of Mathews.\r\nNext morning, at daybreak, we heard the rumbling of a wagon, and soon\r\nafter we spied old Mathews sitting on the top of his boards. He came\r\nsmack against my fence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the devil is this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and began to swear a perfect blue\r\nstreak. Then he took a hammer from his wagon, and began hammering.\r\n\r\nI jumped up, took my rifle and hallooed to him, as if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is there, hammering my fence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour fence?\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cyour fence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir, mine. I located here yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou! you! Get a beard first,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and with another streak of\r\noaths, began hammering again.\r\n\r\nI came up nearer, holding my rifle in good position. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\r\nMr. Mathews, leave my fence alone, or you will get into trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nleveled my rifle at him. \xe2\x80\x9cWill you stop? I give you just two minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have no right to locate\xe2\x80\x94you are a minor,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, livid with rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou just inform yourself better, by asking a polite question or two of\r\nmy parents. They will tell you that I am just twenty-one years and two\r\ndays old, and I can prove it by our family Bible and certificate of\r\nbaptism. I am a Christian, I am, though you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be, judging by\r\nyour cursing,\xe2\x80\x94and as for my beard, you be patient, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it,\r\nfor it is coming as fast as your gray hairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say you wanted this place?\xe2\x80\x9d he growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a question!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ask it because you don\xe2\x80\x99t see my\r\nbeard, but I feel it pushing ahead with all its might. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell\r\nyou, because we ain\xe2\x80\x99t exactly bosom friends, and because that is not the\r\nstyle in which we settlers do business. I kept dark, hoping that you\r\nwould hold on a while longer, trying to get a bigger price for your\r\nplace from Mr. Mechlin. I watched you, and when you let Saturday pass I\r\nknew this sweet little spot was mine,\xe2\x80\x94for on Saturday I was twenty-one,\r\nand you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign your conveyance to Mr. Mechlin until Monday.\r\nTo-day is Tuesday, Mr. Mathews, I shall be twenty-one years and three\r\ndays old at 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock A.M. this day, if I live five hours longer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a word. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t twenty-one. \xe2\x80\x99Tis a lie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d my father said, coming from the cabin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he is a jumper. He\xe2\x80\x99s jumped my claim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t. Look here, Mathews,\xe2\x80\x9d said father, dragging his rifle\r\nalong as if it was a dead cat, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know well it is yourself who is\r\nlying when you say that. You had no right to this claim while you held\r\nthe other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I put up my notice that I was going to locate here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t be silly,\xe2\x80\x9d said father, leaning on his rifle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is painful\r\nto my feelings to hear a grey-headed man talk like a child. You might\r\nhave put twenty notices\xe2\x80\x94what of that? The law don\xe2\x80\x99t allow any circus\r\nperformances like that, and if it did, you ain\xe2\x80\x99t a good enough performer\r\nto ride two horses at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is a mean performance on your part, too, coming here to\r\nsteal a march on me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mean performance, you say? Do you remember how I had my notices up\r\nand my stakes on the ground, six years ago, and when I went to town to\r\nbring my lumber, you jumped my claim? My boy has just barely returned\r\nthe compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be even with you yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, climbing into his wagon, and\r\nbeginning to whip his horses, and swear at us worse than ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same to you; the same to you,\xe2\x80\x9d father would say, as if answering\r\nprayers, and then we both laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the worst, but that you jumped the claim of his\r\naffections,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom, whereupon all laughed, and Fanny bashfully hung\r\ndown her head.\r\n\r\nVoices calling them to dinner were now heard, and they returned to the\r\npicnic grounds.\r\n\r\nNo banquet of the Iliad warriors surpassed this, showing that the\r\nsettlers of Alamar had found the Don\xe2\x80\x99s land and the laws of Congress\r\nvery good.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mrs. Hancock and Mrs. Pittikin were proud of having given a\r\nbanquet which no other settler would dare surpass in Alamar.\r\n\r\nWhen the dessert was being served, Clarence said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must drink to the\r\nbride and groom.\xe2\x80\x9d All agreed that it should be done.\r\n\r\nHe arose and made a neat little speech, which was so \xe2\x80\x9c_sweetly pretty_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. P. said, that it brought tears to the eyes of Mrs. Pittikin and Mrs.\r\nHancock, the elder.\r\n\r\nThis put Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s popularity beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFill your glasses, for I have something to say to Mr. Clarence Darrell,\r\nbut we must first drink his health,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pittikin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is to our friends, the Darrell family, but more particularly to\r\nMr. Clarence. We respect him, we like him, we are proud of him;\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all\r\ndrank\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand I now take the occasion to say to Mr. Darrell, in the\r\npresence of our friends here, that I fulfilled my promise to him, and\r\nhave spoken to our friends here, the heads of families, and they will\r\nspeak to those who are not present, and we will meet to hear what the\r\nDon has to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we don\xe2\x80\x99t promise to accept any proposition, if it don\xe2\x80\x99t suit each\r\none, no matter what anybody votes,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is understood; we want to be polite, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Mr.\r\nPittikin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is all I have requested,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not ask any one\r\nto accept any proposition against his will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is fair enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Hancock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd little enough, considering we are in possession of land that the\r\nDon believes to be his own,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Hager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been for more than fifty years,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo asserted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he lost it by not complying with the law,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if he had not neglected his rights, his title would not have been\r\nrejected; he went to sleep for eight years, and his right was outlawed,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the fault of his lawyers, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it was, but he should have watched his lawyers. The trouble\r\nis, that you can\xe2\x80\x99t teach \xe2\x80\x98an old dog new tricks.\xe2\x80\x99 Those old Spaniards\r\nnever will be business men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pittikin, sententiously.\r\n\r\nIt was finally agreed that Clarence would call on Mr. Mechlin that\r\nevening, to notify him that the settlers would meet the Don on Monday\r\nafternoon at 2 o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the porch of Gasbang\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\xe2\x80\x94_The Don in his Broad Acres._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one great principle of English law,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Charles Dickens says, \xe2\x80\x9cis to\r\nmake business for itself. There is no other principle distinctly,\r\ncertainly and consistently maintained through all its narrow turnings.\r\nViewed by this light, it becomes a coherent scheme, and not the\r\nmonstrous maze the laity are apt to think it. Let them but once clearly\r\nperceive that its grand principle is to make business for itself at\r\ntheir expense, and surely they will cease to grumble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe one great principle of American law is very much the same; our\r\nlaw-givers keep giving us laws and then enacting others to explain them.\r\nThe lawyers find plenty of occupation, but what becomes of the laity?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. 189. _An Act to ascertain and settle the private land claims in the\r\nState of California_,\xe2\x80\x9d says the book.\r\n\r\nAnd by a sad subversion of purposes, all the private land titles became\r\n_unsettled_. It ought to have been said, \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act to _unsettle_ land\r\ntitles, and to upset the rights of the Spanish population of the State\r\nof California.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt thus became not only necessary for the Spanish people to present\r\ntheir titles for revision, and litigate to maintain them (in case of any\r\none contesting their validity, should the least irregularity be\r\ndiscovered, and others covet their possession), but to maintain them\r\nagainst the government before several tribunals; for the government,\r\nbesides making its own laws, _appeals to itself_ as against the\r\nland-owners, after their titles might have been _approved_. But this\r\nbenign Act says (in \xe2\x80\x9cSec. 11\xe2\x80\x9d), \xe2\x80\x9cThat the Commissioners, the District\r\nand Supreme Courts, in deciding on the validity of any claim, shall be\r\ngoverned by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; the law of nations; the\r\nlaws, usages, and customs of the government _from which the claim is\r\nderived_; the principles of equity, and the decisions of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, etc., etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus the government washes its hands clean, liberally providing plenty\r\nof tribunals, plenty of crooked turnings through which to scourge the\r\nwretched land-owners.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano had been for some years under the lash of the maternal\r\ngovernment, whom he had found a cruel stepmother, indeed.\r\n\r\nAs it was arranged with Clarence, the meeting would take place that day\r\non the broad piazza of John Gasbang\xe2\x80\x99s house, this being the most central\r\npoint in the rancho.\r\n\r\nThe heads of families all came\xe2\x80\x94the male heads, be it understood\xe2\x80\x94as the\r\nsquatters did not make any pretence to regard female opinion, with any\r\nmore respect than other men.\r\n\r\nAll the benches and chairs that the house contained, with the exception\r\nof Mrs. Gasbang\xe2\x80\x99s sewing rocker, had been brought to the porch, which\r\nwas quite roomy and airy.\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes before two, all the settlers were there, that is to say,\r\nall the old men, with their elder sons.\r\n\r\nClarence, Romeo, Tom and Jack, sat together in a corner, conversing in\r\nlow tones, while Gasbang was entertaining his guests with some broad\r\nanecdotes, which brought forth peals of laughter.\r\n\r\nAt five minutes to two, Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar, accompanied by Mr. Mechlin,\r\narrived in a buggy; his two sons followed on horseback.\r\n\r\nClarence had time to look at them leisurely, while they dismounted, and\r\ntied their horses to a hitching post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are gentlemen, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet they are,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo coincided. Evidently he admired and liked\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much the boys look like the old man,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey look like Englishmen,\xe2\x80\x9d was Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s next observation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, particularly Victoriano; he is so light he looks more like a\r\nGerman, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Gabriel is very handsome,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom said, \xe2\x80\x9conly of late he seems\r\nalways so sad or thoughtful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat won\xe2\x80\x99t do for a man who is to marry soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\r\nhas always been rather reserved. He has only a cold salutation to give,\r\nwhile Victoriano will be laughing and talking to everybody. But,\r\nperhaps, you are right, and he is changed. I think he is less reconciled\r\nthan the others, to have us, settlers, helping ourselves to what they\r\nconsider their land. He certainly was far more talkative four or five\r\nyears ago. I used to work with them in ploughing and harvesting time,\r\nand both boys, and the Don, were always very kind to me, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhelp liking them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ladies, though, ain\xe2\x80\x99t so affable. They are very proud,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthey walk like queens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem proud to me, but I never spoke to them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo.\r\n\r\nGasbang went forward to meet his guests, and all came into the porch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood afternoon, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano to the settlers, lifting\r\nhis hat and bowing. His sons and Mr. Mechlin did the same. Clarence\r\narose, and so did the other young men with him, returning their\r\nsalutation. The elder Darrell, Pittikin and Hughes followed this\r\nexample; the other settlers nodded only, and remained sitting with their\r\nhats on, looking with affected indifference at the trees beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you for your courtesy in complying with my request to have this\r\nmeeting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Some nodded, others grinned and winked, others smiled\r\nsilently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake this chair, Se\xc3\xb1or, and you, Mr. Mechlin, take this one. They are\r\nthe best in my establishment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang. \xe2\x80\x9cThe young gentlemen will\r\nfind seats somewhere on the benches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence came forward and offered three chairs. Mr. Mechlin took his arm\r\nand presented him to the Alamars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI take pleasure in making your acquaintance, and I hope to have the\r\nopportunity to thank you for your kind co-operation more appropriately\r\nafterward,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano. His sons shook hands with Clarence\r\ncordially, and accepted the proffered chairs.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano excused himself for not speaking English more fluently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me I will repeat my words until I make my\r\nmeaning clear, but I hope you will ask me to repeat them; or, perhaps,\r\nsome one of these young gentlemen will do me the kindness to be my\r\ninterpreter,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomeo talks Spanish; he can interpret for you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk English better,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo proudly replied, thinking he could tell\r\nhis wife that the Don had asked him to be his interpreter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Mr. Clarence Darrell would do me the favor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou speak very good English, se\xc3\xb1or. We understand you perfectly. You do\r\nnot require an interpreter,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so; you speak very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\nGasbang and Pittikin added: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, we understand him very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell and others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Don, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will try to be brief,\r\nand not detain you long.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have all the afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so, we ain\xe2\x80\x99t in a hurry,\xe2\x80\x9d said several.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly let us out in time to bring the milch cows home, before night\r\ncomes on,\xe2\x80\x9d said old Miller, dryly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly, we want to look after our cows, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Don, laughing.\r\n\r\nAll saw the fine irony of the rejoinder, and laughed heartily. Miller\r\nscratched his ear, as if he had felt the retort there, knowing well,\r\nthat with the exception of Mathews and Gasbang, he had killed and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_corraled_\xe2\x80\x9d more of the Don\xe2\x80\x99s cattle than any other settler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking about cows, brings us at once to the object of this\r\nmeeting,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Don Mariano, still smiling, went on, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I\r\nhave lost many, and that it is natural I should wish to save those I\r\nhave left. To do this, and yet not ask that you give up your claims, I\r\nhave one or two propositions to make to you. The reason why you have\r\ntaken up land here is because you want homes. You want to make money.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that the reason? Money! money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said many voices, and all laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I can show you how you may keep your homes and make more money\r\nthan you can by your present methods, while at the same time, I also\r\nsave my cattle. That little point, you know, I must keep in view.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo fence your fields, you have said, is too expensive, particularly as\r\nthe rainy seasons are too uncertain to base upon them any calculations\r\nfor getting crops to pay for fencing. I believe this is what most of you\r\nsay; is it not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe could have raised better crops if your cattle hadn\xe2\x80\x99t damaged them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg to differ; but supposing that you are right, do you think you\r\ncould be sure of good crops if you killed all my stock, or if I took\r\nthem all away to the mountains? No, most assuredly. The rainy season\r\nwould still be irregular and unreliable, I think. Yes, I may say, I feel\r\nsure, it is a mistake to try to make San Diego County a grain-producing\r\ncounty. It is not so, and I feel certain it never will be, to any great\r\nextent. This county is, and has been, and will be always, a good grazing\r\ncounty\xe2\x80\x94one of the best counties for cattle-raising on this coast, and\r\nthe very best for fruit-raising on the face of the earth. God intended\r\nit should be. Why, then, not devote your time, your labor and your money\r\nto raising vineyards, fruits and cattle, instead of trusting to the\r\nuncertain rains to give you grain crops?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes a long time to get fruit trees to bearing. What are we to do\r\nfor a living in the meantime?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegin raising cattle\xe2\x80\x94that will support you,\xe2\x80\x9d the Don replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the capital to buy cattle with?\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t require any more capital than you already have. I can let\r\neach of you have a number of cows to begin with, and give you four or\r\nfive years\xe2\x80\x99 time to pay me. So you see, it will be with the increase of\r\nthese cattle you will pay, for I shall charge you no interest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you expect us to do in return? To give back to you our\r\nhomesteads?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; I have said, and repeat again, you will retain your\r\nhomesteads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you stop contesting our claims?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, and will give each one a quit-claim deed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not fight our claims, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want us to plant grain on\r\nour land,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can plant grain, if you like, but to do so you must fence your\r\nland; so, as you all say, that fencing is expensive, I suggest your\r\nfencing orchards and vineyards only, but not grain fields\xe2\x80\x94I mean large\r\nfields.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw! I knew there was to be something behind all that display of\r\ngenerosity,\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Mathews.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano reddened with a thrill of annoyance, but quietly answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too good business men to suppose that I should not reserve some\r\nslight advantage for myself, when I am willing you should have many more\r\nyourselves. All I want to do is to save the few cattle I have left. I am\r\nwilling to quit-claim to you the land you have taken, and give you\r\ncattle to begin the stock business, and all I ask you in return is to\r\nput a fence around whatever land you wish to cultivate, so that my\r\ncattle cannot go in there. So I say, plant vineyards, plant olives,\r\nfigs, oranges; makes wines and oil and raisins; export olives and dried\r\nand canned fruits. I had some very fine California canned fruit sent to\r\nme from San Francisco. Why could we not can fruits as well, or better?\r\nOur olives are splendid\xe2\x80\x94the same our figs, oranges, apricots, and truly\r\nall semi-tropical fruits are of a superior quality. When this fact\r\nbecomes generally known, I feel very sure that San Diego County will be\r\nselected for fruit and grape-growing. In two years grape vines begin to\r\nbear; the same with figs, peaches and other fruits. At three years old\r\nthey bear quite well, and all without irrigation. So you would not have\r\nto wait so very long to begin getting a return from your labor and\r\ncapital. Moreover, an orchard of forty acres or vineyard of twenty will\r\npay better after three years\xe2\x80\x99 growth than one hundred and sixty acres of\r\nwheat or barley in good seasons, and more than three hundred acres of\r\nany grain in moderately good seasons, or one thousand acres in bad\r\nseasons. You can easily fence twenty or forty or sixty acres for a\r\nvineyard or orchard, but not so easily fence a field of one hundred and\r\nsixty, and the grain crop would be uncertain, depending on the rains,\r\nbut not so the trees, for you can irrigate them, and after the trees are\r\nrooted that is not required.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the water to irrigate?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe water is in the sea now, for there we let it go every year; but if\r\nwe were sensible, judicious men, we would not let it go to waste\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nwould save it. This rancho has many deep ravines which bring water from\r\nhills and sierras. These ravines all open into the valleys, and run like\r\nso many little rivers in the rainy season. By converting these ravines\r\ninto reservoirs we could have more water than would be needed for\r\nirrigating the fruit trees on the foothills. In the low valleys no\r\nirrigation would be needed. If we all join forces to put up dams across\r\nthe most convenient of these ravines, we will have splendid reservoirs.\r\nI will defray half the expense if you will get together and stand the\r\nother half. Believe me, it will be a great God-send to have a thriving,\r\nfruit-growing business in our county. To have the cultivated land well\r\nfenced, and the remainder left out for grazing. Then there would not be\r\nso many thousands upon thousands of useless acres as now have to be. For\r\nevery ten acres of cultivated land (not fenced) there are ten thousand,\r\nyes, twenty thousand, entirely idle, useless. Why? Because those ten\r\nacres of growing grain must be protected, and the cattle which don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow the \xe2\x80\x98_no fence_\xe2\x80\x99 law, follow their inclination to go and eat the\r\ngreen grass. Then they are \xe2\x80\x98_corralled_\xe2\x80\x99 or killed. Is it not a pity to\r\nkill the poor dumb brutes, because we can\xe2\x80\x99t make them understand the\r\nlaw, and see the wisdom of our Sacramento legislators who enacted it?\r\nAnd is it not a pity to impoverish our county by making the bulk of its\r\nland useless? The foolishness of letting all of the rainfall go to\r\nwaste, is an old time folly with us. Still, in old times, we had, at\r\nleast, the good excuse that we raised all the fruits we needed for our\r\nuse, and there was no market for any more. But we were not then, as now,\r\nguilty of the folly of making the land useless. We raised cattle and\r\nsold hides and tallow every year, and made money. When gold was\r\ndiscovered, we drove our stock north, got a good price for it, and made\r\nmoney. But now no money will be made by anybody out of cattle, if they\r\nare to be destroyed, and no money made out of land, for the grazing will\r\nbe useless, when there will be no stock left to eat it. Thus, the county\r\nwill have no cattle, and the crops be always uncertain. Believe me, in\r\nyears to come, you will see that the county was impoverished by the \xe2\x80\x98no\r\nfence law,\xe2\x80\x99 unless we try to save our county, in spite of foolish\r\nlegislation. If our wise legislators could enact a law obliging rain to\r\ncome, so that we could have better chances to raise grain, then there\r\nwould be some show of excuse for the \xe2\x80\x98_no fence law_,\xe2\x80\x99 _perhaps_. I say\r\n*PERHAPS*, because, in my humble opinion, we ought to prefer cattle\r\nraising and fruit growing for our county. We should make these our\r\nspecialty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be much more foolish to trust to a few cows to make\r\nout a living while trees grow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miller, \xe2\x80\x9cthan to the seasons to\r\ngive us grain crops.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; because cattle are sure to increase, if they are not killed,\r\nand you could make cheese and butter, and sell your steers every year,\r\nwhile trees grow. You have been seven years a settler on this rancho. In\r\nthese seven years you have raised two good crops; three poor, or only\r\nmiddling, and two, no crops at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because your cattle destroyed them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; my cattle were not all over California; but the bad seasons\r\nwere, and only in few places, moderately good crops were harvested; in\r\nthe southern counties none at all. We had rains enough to get\r\nsufficiently good grazing, but not to raise grain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you are right about the uncertainty of our seasons, and I think\r\na good dairy always pays well, also a good orchard and vineyard,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDarrell. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the question is, whether we can adopt some feasible plan\r\nto put your idea into practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, how many cows will you let us have?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hager.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will divide with you. Next week I shall have my \xe2\x80\x98_rodeo_.\xe2\x80\x99 We can see\r\nthen the number of cattle I have left. We shall count them. I shall take\r\nhalf, the other half you divide pro rata; each head of a family taking a\r\nproportionate number of cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is fair,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any cattle. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t no \xe2\x80\x98_vaquero_\xe2\x80\x99 to go \xe2\x80\x98_busquering_\xe2\x80\x99\r\naround and _lassooing_ cattle. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lasso myself; what do I know about\r\nwhirling a _lariat_?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, don\xe2\x80\x99t take cattle. You can raise fruit trees and vineyards,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDarrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and starve meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not have to be a vaquero. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go \xe2\x80\x98_busquering_\xe2\x80\x99 around\r\n_lassooing_, unless I wish to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Don. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can hire an\r\nIndian boy to do that part. They know how to handle _la reata_ and\r\n_echar el lazo_ to perfection. You will not starve, either, for if you\r\nwish, you can make butter and cheese enough to help to pay expenses. I\r\nthink this State ought to make and export as good cheese as it now\r\nimports, and some day people will see it, and do it, too. Thus, with the\r\nproduce of your dairies, at first, and afterward with your fruits, you\r\nwill do far better than with grain crops, and not work as hard. Let the\r\nnorthern counties raise grain, while we raise fruits and make wine,\r\nbutter and cheese. You must not forget, either, that every year you can\r\nsell a number of cattle, besides keeping as many milch cows as you\r\nneed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere can we sell our cattle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Hancock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCattle-buyers will come to buy from you. But if you prefer it, you can\r\ndrive your stock north yourselves, and make a good profit. Since 1850, I\r\nhave sent nine times droves of cattle to the northern counties, and made\r\na handsome profit every time. The first time we took stock north, was in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9950; I took nearly six thousand head\xe2\x80\x94three thousand were mine\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nothers belonged to my brothers. We lost very few, and sold at a good\r\nprice\xe2\x80\x94all the way from eighteen to twenty-five dollars per head. About\r\nfive hundred of mine I sold as high as thirty dollars per head. I made\r\nsixty thousand dollars by this operation. Then out of the next lot I\r\nmade twenty-seven thousand dollars. Then I made twenty-two thousand, and\r\nso on, until my tame cows began to disappear, as you all know. In four\r\nyears after my cows began to get shot, my cattle decreased more than\r\nhalf. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have many more than three thousand head. So\r\nyou cannot blame me for wishing to save these few. But believe me, the\r\nplan I propose will be as beneficial to you as to me, and also to the\r\nentire county, for as soon as it is shown that we can make a success of\r\nthe industries I propose, others will follow our example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have only three thousand head, you can\xe2\x80\x99t spare many to us, and\r\nit will hardly be worth while to stop planting crops to get a few cows,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I will be able to spare five or six hundred cows. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow many I have left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will buy from somebody else, if we want more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t want many to begin with; it will be something of an experiment for\r\nsome of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor all of us here. Perhaps you understand _vaquering_; we don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHancock; all laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen fence your claim and plant grain,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so big a fool as to spend money in fences. The \xe2\x80\x98_no fence_\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlaw is better than all the best fences,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if you make more money by following other laws that are more\r\njust, more rational?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Don.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98no fence\xe2\x80\x99 law is rational enough for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so say I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang.\r\n\r\nHughes nodded approvingly, but he was too much of a hypocrite to commit\r\nhimself in words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not come to discuss the \xe2\x80\x98no fence\xe2\x80\x99 law, but only to propose\r\nsomething that will put more money in your pockets than killing dumb\r\nbeasts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen propose something practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think what has been proposed is practicable enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I, either,\xe2\x80\x9d added Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I, neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall leave you now; you\r\nknow my views, and you perhaps prefer to discuss them, and discuss your\r\nown among yourselves, and not in my presence. Take your time, and when\r\nyou come to a final decision let me know. Perhaps I can advance the\r\nmoney to those of you who do not have it ready to purchase fencing\r\nlumber. I shall charge no interest, and give you plenty of time to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will do that, Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said; \xe2\x80\x9cif the settlers agree to\r\nfence their lands, I will advance the money to them to put up their\r\nfences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and if our crops fail, we will be in debt to the ears, with a\r\nchain around our necks,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said that if it were not for my cattle, your crops would\r\nnot have failed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said so, and it is so. But you see, that was before we had the \xe2\x80\x98_no\r\nfence_\xe2\x80\x99 law,\xe2\x80\x9d answered he, grinning.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano shook hands with Clarence, whom he invited to call at his\r\nhouse\xe2\x80\x94this invitation Clarence accepted with warm thanks\xe2\x80\x94and followed by\r\nhis sons and his friend Mr. Mechlin, Don Mariano took his leave, bowing\r\nto the settlers, who nodded and grinned in return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you, too, think the \xe2\x80\x98_no fence_\xe2\x80\x99 law iniquitous, as you\r\nappear to favor the aristocracy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gasbang to Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is worse than that, it is stupid. Now it kills the cattle,\r\nafterwards it will kill the county,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we plant no wheat, because the Spaniards want to raise cattle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMathews asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlant wheat, if you can do so without killing cattle. But do not\r\ndestroy the larger industry with the smaller. If, as the Don very\r\nproperly says, this is a grazing county, no legislation can change it.\r\nSo it would be wiser to make laws to suit the county, and not expect\r\nthat the county will change its character to suit absurd laws,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\xe2\x80\x94_Naughty Dog Milord an Important Factor._\r\n\r\n\r\nThree large wagons, each drawn by six horses, were hauling the lumber\r\nfor Mr. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s house, which was already commenced.\r\n\r\nVictoriano, riding across the valley, had to stop to let the heavily\r\nloaded wagons pass. This gave Clarence time to overtake him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to catch up with you, Don\r\nVictoriano. I have been wanting to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictoriano bowed, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWill you go to my house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not. I am not dressed to be seen by ladies. I would\r\nrather speak to you here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to build a large house, Mr. Darrell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano,\r\nturning his horse so as to ride beside Clarence; \xe2\x80\x9cjudging by the amount\r\nof lumber being hauled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; rather. We are a large family, and require a good deal of room.\r\nBut before we do any more work I want to speak with your father. I want\r\nto ask him\xe2\x80\x94ask him as a favor\xe2\x80\x94and yet, as a business proposition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nhesitated; he was evidently embarrassed; but Victoriano, not guessing\r\nthe drift of his words, remained waiting silently, offering no\r\nassistance. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean this: I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this\r\nfashion of taking people\xe2\x80\x99s lands, and I would like to pay to Se\xc3\xb1or\r\nAlamar for what has been located by us, but at the same time I do not\r\nwish my father to know that I have paid for the land, as I am sure he\r\nwould take my action as a reproach\xe2\x80\x94as a disclaimer of his own action,\r\nand I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to hurt his feelings, or seem to be disrespectful or\r\ncensorious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, and I think my father will be willing to sell the land.\r\nHe is at home now. Let us go up to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad you not better speak to him, and make an appointment for me to see\r\nhim to-morrow, or some other time? I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not risk being seen by the\r\nladies in this blue flannel shirt and heavy boots. I look too rough\xe2\x80\x94like\r\na smuggler or a squatter, sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can call my father to speak to you outside, so that the ladies need\r\nnot see you. But if they should, that needn\xe2\x80\x99t disturb you. They have too\r\nmuch sense not to know that you would not be working in white kid\r\ngloves. Come on. The front veranda is empty. Mother and three of my\r\nsisters are at the Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s. Mercedes is the only one at home, and she\r\nis too busy with her embroidery in Madam Halier\xe2\x80\x99s room to come near you.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring father to the front veranda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence and Victoriano tied their horses by the garden gate and walked\r\nto the piazza. The hall door was ajar. Clarence saw no ladies about and\r\nfelt reassured.\r\n\r\nThere were three steps leading from the walk through the garden up to\r\nthe front veranda. These steps were exactly opposite to the hall door.\r\n\r\nVictoriano took the path to the right, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cGo up and sit down. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring my father here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not disturb him if he is taking his _siesta_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe _siesta_ hour is past, I\xe2\x80\x99ll find him at the office,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, going\r\nround the corner, leaving Clarence to walk up the front step. As he did\r\nso, he heard a tinkling of little bells and rushing of feet, as if\r\nsomebody was running. Then a laughing voice, the timbre of which was\r\nsweetly pleasing, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, Milord! you bad dog! Milord! Milord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, through the narrow opening of the door, out darted a\r\nlittle white dog, dragging after him a large and much entangled skein of\r\nbright-colored silk. Clarence was nearly stepping on the little runaway,\r\nwhen the door was flung open, and a girl rushed out, coming against him\r\nbefore she could check herself. In her effort to do so she turned her\r\nfoot and staggered forward, but before she realized she was in any one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence, she felt two strong arms holding her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, as a sharp, hot pain darted through her ankle. She\r\nsaw that the two arms which held her were none of her father or\r\nbrothers\xe2\x80\x99, and that they were covered with blue flannel.\r\n\r\nLooking up to see the face above them, their eyes met. Hers expressed\r\nsurprise, his merriment. But a change in their expression flashed\r\ninstantaneously, and both felt each other tremble, thrilled with the\r\nbliss of their proximity. Her face was suffused with burning blushes.\r\nShe was bewildered, and without daring to meet his eyes again, stammered\r\nan apology; extending her hand, to reach some chair or table to hold\r\nherself, but they all were crowded at both ends of the piazza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are hurt. I am afraid you are hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with pale lips,\r\nreflecting the pallor he saw come to her face, succeeding her crimson\r\nblush. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are suffering. What can I do? I am so sorry!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, I only turned my foot a little,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, venturing to look\r\nat him for an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be all right in a minute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you turned your foot, don\xe2\x80\x99t put any weight upon it. Do not try to\r\nwalk, let me carry you to a chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, no! I am not so much hurt as to require giving all that trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Please_ let me. It will be no trouble; only a great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d He was\r\nin earnest and spoke quite seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you afraid I could not carry\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not that, but it is not necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and she tried to walk. A quick,\r\nsharp, burning pain through her ankle admonished her that she was more\r\nhurt than she had believed. A slight contraction of her brows betrayed\r\nher pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! You will hurt yourself worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and before she knew what\r\nhe was going to do, he stooped a little and lifted her as easily as if\r\nshe had been a little child. She had no time to think whether to be\r\ngrateful or offended, for he quickly walked to the further end of the\r\npiazza and carefully placed her in a roomy arm chair. Then bending a\r\nknee before her, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive my lifting you without your permission. I knew you would not\r\ngive it, and I knew also that you were suffering. Will you forgive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis voice was soft, caressing, pleading, but his eyes seemed to her to\r\nemit rays full of attractive, earnest force which she felt had great\r\npower. They dazzled her, and yet those eyes were so mild, so kind. She\r\nlooked down, making no answer. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Don Victoriano comes he can carry\r\nyou to bed, and\xe2\x80\x94please\xe2\x80\x94take my advice, stay there until the pain has\r\nentirely left your foot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe ventured to look at his eyes again. Who could this strong young man\r\nbe, so bold, and yet so gentle, so courteous and yet waiting for no\r\npermission to take so positively hold of her, to carry her bodily half\r\nthe length of the piazza. And now so respectfully asking on his knees to\r\nbe forgiven? Asking with tones of tender humility in his voice, while\r\nhis eyes she knew could emanate subduing magnetic beams.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know Victoriano is coming? He went out riding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nevading the question of forgiveness, and for the sake of making some\r\nreply that would hide her confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but I met him and he returned with me. He has gone to look for\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Alamar, I came to see him on business,\xe2\x80\x9d said the respectful young\r\nman, still on his knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know my father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly very slightly.\xe2\x80\x9d They were silent. He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI met him a few days\r\nago when he had that meeting with the squatters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you at the meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, avoiding his gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, watching her beautiful face. What would she think of\r\nhim, believing him a _Squatter_, one who came to take land that did not\r\nbelong to him? How he wished that she would look up, that he might see\r\nher lovely eyes again, for if to her his eyes seemed so glorious, to him\r\nhers fascinated, conquered, with a power that he never thought could\r\nexist in any human being. Trembling, he felt that he was madly in love\r\nwith her. Yes, already in love. Love at first sight, surely. But if it\r\nkilled him, no matter, he would love her to the last instant of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nVoices were heard approaching through the hall. He stood up and walked\r\ntowards the door. Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar came forward and shook hands with him.\r\nVictoriano explained the reason of his delay being, that he had to look\r\nfor his father all over the house, and at last found him in the furthest\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_corral_\xe2\x80\x9d looking at some new colts just brought in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad that Mercedes came to converse with you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not come to converse. I did not know that the gentleman was here.\r\nI came by accident,\xe2\x80\x9d she hastened to reply. \xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to catch\r\nMilord when I stumbled and would have fallen, had not this gentleman\r\nprevented it.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, she blushed anew; her blushes being\r\nimmediately reflected on Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, made them both look like a\r\ncouple of culprits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear the lady\xe2\x80\x99s foot is hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Don Mariano, going towards Mercedes. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes it pain\r\nyou baby?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes papa, a little. It burns me. Do you think it would be bad for me to\r\nwalk to my room?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, and blushed redder yet at his\r\ntemerity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you stand on your foot?\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try. I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry you to your room,\xe2\x80\x9d said her father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen have no business to have such small feet. They are always\r\nstumbling and can\xe2\x80\x99t walk worth a cent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, going to look\r\nat his sister\xe2\x80\x99s foot. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here. No wonder they stumble. Look at the\r\nlittle slipper. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t they wear good broad boots?\xe2\x80\x9d So saying he took\r\noff the little slipper, which seemed made for a Cinderella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are too absurd,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, blushing again, to see her slipper\r\nbrandished aloft, in the face of a stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s women\xe2\x80\x99s feet that are absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we want the ladies to be infantry soldiers, then we will ask them\r\nto cultivate big feet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not until then, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! I see you cherish the general male weakness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano,\r\nkneeling before his sister to put on the little slipper. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the only\r\nstrong-minded man, I know. Come, pussy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry you to your room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no. You take me, papa, Tano might drop me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense; as if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t carry a kitten like you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, you take me, but not to bed. Put me on the lounge in mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroom, and call Madam Halier to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; anything to please the children,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, stooping\r\nto lift her.\r\n\r\nShe put her arms around his neck, and whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cPapa, who is this\r\nyoung man? I never saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, taking her up, and turning toward\r\nClarence, said: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell, permit me to present you to my daughter,\r\nMercedes, \xe2\x80\x98our baby.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he dandled her a little in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, papa, you make me ridiculous! How can I bow like a lady, when you\r\nare rocking me like an infant!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing, but blushing again\r\nlike a rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShake hands with the gentleman, that\xe2\x80\x99s a dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano,\r\ntalking baby talk to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, papa, make Tano hush. Mr. Darrell, I am afraid that I shall always\r\nseem ridiculous to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all; I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I fear that your\r\nhurt might be serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. You might be ridiculous, but your hurt might be serious,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Victoriano.\r\n\r\nIt was Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s turn to blush now, but he smiled good naturedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be serious, though. I wish you were, and polite, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMercedes. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Mr. Darrell will think of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell will see us often, I hope, and think better of Tano,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Mariano, carrying away his precious burden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is all that you could wish, Miss Mercedes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence,\r\nand their eyes met, transmitting that strange thrill to both.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano placed Mercedes tenderly on her mamma\xe2\x80\x99s lounge, called Madam\r\nHalier to attend to the sprained ankle, and returned to the veranda.\r\n\r\nClarence made no delay in stating the object of his visit. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the meeting I have had several talks with the settlers, and the\r\nresult has been my conviction, that they will not accept your generous\r\noffer. They, no doubt, wish to take up more land, and think it cannot be\r\ndone if they bind themselves to put up fences by accepting your\r\nproposition. How short-sighted they are time alone will show, for at\r\npresent they will not listen to reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry. There is no alternative for me but to sell all my\r\ncattle as soon as possible, and in the meantime drive all I can to the\r\nmountains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that will be ruinous, father. How can we herd them in the\r\nmountains? They will all become wild and run away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid they will. I am sure of it, in fact. But there is no other\r\nway to save any at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think this \xe2\x80\x98no fence\xe2\x80\x99 law the most scandalous, bare-faced outrage\r\nupon the rights of citizens that I ever heard of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence,\r\nwarmly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is like setting irresponsible trespassers loose upon a\r\npeaceable people, and then rewarding their outrage. To let any one take\r\nup your lands right before your eyes is outrage enough, but to cap the\r\nclimax by authorizing people to plant crops without fences and then\r\n_corral_ your cattle, which must be attracted to the green grass, I call\r\npositively disgraceful, in a community which is not of vandals. It is\r\nshameful to the American name. I am utterly disgusted with the whole\r\nbusiness, and the only thing that will make matters a little tolerable\r\nto me will be for you to do me the favor of permitting me to pay for the\r\nland we have located.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes your father wish to pay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not know whether he would or not. I fear he would not. My father\r\nis a blind worshiper of the Congress of these United States, and\r\nconsequently it is difficult to persuade him that our legislators might\r\npossibly do wrong. He believes that Congress has the right to declare\r\n_all_ California open to pre-emption, and all American citizens free to\r\nchoose any land not already patented. Thus, he thinks he has the right\r\nto locate on your land (according to law, mind you), because he believes\r\nyour title has been rejected. But as my faith in our law-givers is not\r\nso blind, my belief is that Congress had no more right to pass any law\r\nwhich could give an excuse to trespass upon your property, than to pass\r\na law inviting people to your table. I feel a sort of impatience to\r\nthink that in our country could exist a law which is so outrageously\r\nunjust. My pride as an American is somewhat different from that of my\r\nfather. He thinks it is a want of patriotism to criticise our\r\nlegislation. Whereas, I think our theory of government is so lofty, so\r\ngrand and exalted, that we must watch jealously that Congress may not\r\nmisinterpret it; misrepresent the sentiments, the aspirations of the\r\nAmerican people, and thus make a caricature of our beautiful ideal. It\r\nis our duty and privilege to criticise our laws, and criticise severely.\r\nAs long as you, the native Californians, were to be despoiled of your\r\nlands, I think it would have been better to have passed a law of\r\nconfiscation. Then we would have stood before the world with the\r\nresponsibility of that barbarous act upon own shoulders. That would have\r\nbeen a national shame, but not so great as that of guaranteeing, by\r\ntreaty, a protection which was not only withheld, but which was\r\ndenied,\xe2\x80\x94snatched away, treacherously,\xe2\x80\x94making its denial legal by\r\nenactments of retroactive laws. This I call disgraceful to the American\r\nname. Therefore, in my humble way and limited sphere, if I cannot\r\nrepeal, I will at least evade such unjust laws to the best of my\r\nability, and make them ineffective as far as I am individually\r\nconcerned. I only wish I could wipe out those stains on our national\r\nhonor, by repealing at once laws so discreditable to us. Yes, the more\r\nso, as they bear directly upon the most defenseless, the most powerless\r\nof our citizens\xe2\x80\x94the orphaned Spano-Americans. So, then, I hope you will\r\nhelp me to avoid this American shame, by permitting me to pay for our\r\nland whatever price you think just.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, pleased with Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s honest warmth,\r\nand to hear him express opinions and sentiments so very similar to his\r\nown. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can pay whatever you wish, or we can make an agreement that I\r\nwill sell to you when I get my patent. Such is my understanding with Mr.\r\nMechlin and also with your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is rather vague. I would prefer to pay to you now so much per\r\nacre. With the understanding that my father (or any one else) is not to\r\nknow I have made this purchase. I mean not for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould your father object to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not. And yet he might see in it a disclaimer from my part\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncriticism. He is a settler\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x98_Squatter_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94you know, and consequently\r\nvery sensitive about (what they call) \xe2\x80\x98_rights of settlers under the\r\nlaw_.\xe2\x80\x99 He knows my sentiments, but one thing is my expressing them to\r\nhim, and another is to pay money for land he thinks he has lawfully\r\nappropriated. It might seem to him, I imply that his locating perhaps\r\nwas not altogether as honorable a transaction in my eyes, as it may be\r\nlawful in the eyes of the lawmakers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are certainly very honorable, and I am willing to abide by your\r\nwishes in the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano. \xe2\x80\x9cYou view this question exactly\r\nas I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence blushed with pleasure and bowed, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind, and that you, who are so generous, should be made to\r\nsuffer as you have, it is, I assure you, so revolting to me (as an\r\nAmerican and a civilized being) that I have felt great desire to go away\r\nrather than to live among these short-sighted and unappreciative people\r\nthat have unfortunately fallen upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo don\xe2\x80\x99t go away. Let me have one friend\r\nat least, among so many opponents. Pay whatever you wish, and take as\r\nmuch land as you desire to have, but don\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, indeed, but will you not name the price? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\r\nis right for me to put a price upon your property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir, that would be so if my property was not going into\xe2\x80\x94smoke\r\nof sulphur\xe2\x80\x94but as it is, and growing fast so \xe2\x80\x98beautifully less\xe2\x80\x99 that I\r\nsuppose even the $1.25 of government price ought to be a handsome figure\r\nto my weary eyes. So name any price you wish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that Clarence would pay $10.00 per acre, and take up 640\r\nacres where his father had already located. It was also understood that\r\nthe purchase should not be mentioned to any one. Don Mariano excepted\r\nonly his son Gabriel. Clarence said he would except his mother, inasmuch\r\nas she had told him to pay for the land or else she would not come to\r\nreside upon it.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano said that he would like to mention it to his family and the\r\nMechlins, but feared that if only some allusion was overheard by the\r\nservants, it would be repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no objection to Mr. Mechlin knowing it,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but they have for servants Hogsden and his wife, and they are very\r\ndishonorable. They would repeat it if by accident they heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity that Mrs. Mechlin don\xe2\x80\x99t send those two thieves away,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nVictoriano said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I hear that the woman Hogsden repeats things she hears at the\r\nMechlins,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she does, and steals too, and yet Mrs. Mechlin keeps them,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nVictoriano said, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it would be best to say nothing, and I will watch my chance to\r\ntell my father myself, that I paid for the land,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said. He then\r\nrose to go.\r\n\r\nAs he went down the veranda steps he met Milord returning, still\r\ndragging the skein of silk. But this was no longer of bright variegated\r\nhues, it was black with mud and sadly masticated by Milord\xe2\x80\x99s sharp\r\nteeth, which proudly held it as if challenging any one to take it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wicked Milord. See what you have done with your poor mistress\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsilk. She will be distressed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\nOn hearing himself thus apostrophised, Milord ran off again with his\r\nplunder, and it was with difficulty that by the combined efforts of\r\nVictoriano and Clarence he was at last captured, but the bright colors\r\nof the silk had all disappeared, a blackened skein resembling a piece of\r\nwet rope was pulled from Milord\xe2\x80\x99s sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\xe2\x80\x94_From Alameda to San Diego._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darrell house was now finished, the furniture had arrived, been\r\nunpacked and distributed in the rooms, but the house seemed to old\r\nDarrell entirely too sumptuous for the plain folks, that his family\r\nought to be. That was a truth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Clarence, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you been too extravagant in buying such\r\nexpensive carpets, such fine furniture? For gracious sake, how big is\r\nthe bill for all this grandeur?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet the price of every item, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, I am\r\nsure they would not go beyond the limit I gave Hubert (Hubert made the\r\npurchases), and I assure you, it will all be paid with our volunteer\r\ncrop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be sure of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, but I am sure\xe2\x80\x94only not too much so\xe2\x80\x94which is the right way of being\r\nsure,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.\r\n\r\nClarence was now a regular caller at the Alamar and the Mechlin houses.\r\nHe felt that in both places the welcome he received was sincere, for\r\neven the silent Gabriel was always ready to talk to him. As for\r\nVictoriano, his attachment to Clarence was now an acknowledged and\r\naccepted fact,\xe2\x80\x94not rejected by Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar, to judge by\r\nappearances,\xe2\x80\x94and certainly fully and sincerely reciprocated by Clarence.\r\nBoth found great pleasure in each other\xe2\x80\x99s society, and saw each other\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nIt was now time for Clarence to go to Alameda to bring down the family.\r\nHe and Victoriano talked about it walking towards the Alamar house from\r\nthe Darrells, discussing the probable time of his return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence has come to bid us good-by,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, walking into the\r\nparlor, followed by Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! Where is he going?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, rising, dropping the book she\r\nwas reading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed, he is only going to bring his mother and sisters\r\ndown,\xe2\x80\x9d added Victoriano, maliciously, causing the blood to rush to her\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed, sitting down, with a resentful look toward her\r\nbrother, and a half appealing, half deprecating one to Clarence, who was\r\ncontemplating her in ecstatic silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the Holman girls will be coming about the same time. I was\r\ntelling Clarence to look after them a little, if convenient, and if they\r\nare not sea-sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will require my services more if they are sick,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a good nurse,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano observed; adding, \xe2\x80\x9cImagine Corina\r\nHolman nursed by a strange young gentleman; that would kill her sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would try and prevent that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, for my friends. I do not think they will be very ill; but I\r\nam sure it will be pleasant for them to have so good an escort,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMercedes.\r\n\r\nClarence promised, therefore, to look after the Misses Holman, and let\r\nthem know which steamer would be best to take coming to San Diego.\r\n\r\nMercedes said she would write notifying them of this arrangement.\r\n\r\nThere was a great _something_ in Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s mind that he wished to say\r\nto Mercedes before leaving, but he had neither courage nor opportunity\r\nto say it, so he left, carrying with him the burden of his thoughts\r\nuntold.\r\n\r\nHis voyage was accomplished in safety, the steamer arriving at San\r\nFrancisco at the regular time. Hubert Haverly came to meet him, and\r\ntogether they went to a restaurant for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us the most secluded room and the nicest breakfast your\r\nestablishment can produce, for this gentleman is very particular, and I\r\nam very hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hubert.\r\n\r\nThe waiter smiled, showed them to the best room in the house, and\r\nretired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let us talk,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hubert, \xe2\x80\x9cI am dying to tell you how rich you\r\nare, and scold you for not letting me keep your stock longer and making\r\nyou richer. Why were you so anxious to sell? The stock kept rising\r\nsteadily. I was a \xe2\x80\x98bull\xe2\x80\x99 all the time. There was a slight break\r\nonce\xe2\x80\x94only once. Some fellows wanted to pull the stock down, and got a\r\nfew \xe2\x80\x98bears\xe2\x80\x99 to work with them. It lowered a little, but only a few of\r\nthe heavy holders had any fear, and it soon recovered, shooting up\r\nhigher than ever. I got your order to sell about that time, and did so,\r\nbut I assure you my heart ached when I did it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote you immediately after that, it was only the first hundred\r\nshares I wanted sold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that letter I got three days after I had sold all. I almost\r\ncried like a girl, with disappointment, when you wrote that I was to\r\nsend you only $6000. Now, you could have made a whole million with your\r\nthousand shares.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA whole million?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost assuredly. Look at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s quotations, and the stock is still\r\nrising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, reading the stock report; \xe2\x80\x9cthe last paper I saw\r\nwas dated six days ago. But even then \xe2\x80\x98Crown Point\xe2\x80\x99 was still very\r\nhigh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it was, but it is very disappointing to get one-half of a\r\nmillion when you might as well get a whole million. I shall never cease\r\nscolding you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bear the scolding patiently, considering that it was to\r\navoid scoldings that I gave you the order to sell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo avoid scolding? How so? From whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my father. He is terribly down on mining stocks. He would consider\r\nme next to a thief if he thought I bought stocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is absurd. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him how much money you have. Here is\r\nmy statement of all I made; my commission and moneys paid for you. I\r\nsold your stock at a fraction over $800 per share. Oh, Clarence, why did\r\nyou make me sell? Look at this. After buying the government bonds as\r\nordered you have left $260,000, when you might have had half a million\r\nover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. I made enough. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather let some one else make the\r\nbalance than to sell when things begin to tumble down. Did you say\r\n$260,000?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, $260,000, when it ought to be $400,000 at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence laughed at Hubert\xe2\x80\x99s rueful face.\r\n\r\nThe waiter brought in their breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBroiled oysters on toast! Oysters baked in the shell! Broiled chicken.\r\nLet us discuss them in preference to stock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\nHaving helped his friend and then himself, Hubert said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do with your $260,000 now since you are not to\r\nbuy stock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not thought about it, but I guess the best thing would be to\r\ninvest all in government bonds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the same as burying your cash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do. I would like to make a safe\r\ninvestment that would give me about $30,000 a year, and then I could\r\nafford to let you gamble with the balance, if there was any balance\r\nleft,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see to-day what government bonds are selling for, and report to\r\nyou this evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat can\xe2\x80\x99t be, as I am to take the two o\xe2\x80\x99clock boat for Alameda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will you be back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow evening if you want me, but if not I shall wait until the\r\nfamily comes down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lucky fellow he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hubert, walking towards the Stock\r\nExchange, after promising Clarence to see him to the boat at two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cIn two years he has made a fortune with a capital of $2000.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHubert was right. Clarence had been a lucky investor. With the sum of\r\n$2000 bequeathed to him by Mrs. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s Aunt Newton, when he was only\r\nfive years old, and which sum she ordered should be put at interest\r\nuntil he was twenty-one years of age, Clarence speculated, and now he\r\nwas worth close on to a million dollars.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready for the journey when Clarence arrived at his\r\nAlameda home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that it pulls my heart string to tear you away from this\r\nplace?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, looking towards the nice orchard and field\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll make us cry if you talk like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Darrell. \xe2\x80\x9cAlice\r\nhas nearly cried her eyes out already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, our lease of this place won\xe2\x80\x99t be out for two years yet, and\r\nwe can come back if the other don\xe2\x80\x99t suit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence encouragingly.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, the Darrells left Alameda on their way to San Diego,\r\nstopping for a couple of days only at San Francisco. On board the\r\nsteamer Clarence met Mr. Alfred Holman, who had accompanied his\r\ndaughters and now placed them under Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s care\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to\r\ninstructions from Miss Mercedes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Holman added, making Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblood rush to his head, as it always did whenever that sweetest of all\r\nnames was mentioned in his presence. \xe2\x80\x9cTell the Alamares I shall be down\r\nsoon. I am only waiting for Tom Scott to escort me.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, Mr.\r\nHolman laughed and hurriedly kissing his daughters, ran down the gang\r\nplank.\r\n\r\nClarence lost no time in presenting the Misses Holman to his mother,\r\nsisters and brothers, all of whom received them with politeness, though\r\nwith different degrees of warmth, according to the natural share of\r\naffability or that diffidence which half of Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s children inherited\r\nfrom him, especially the two eldest daughters. The amiability of Alice\r\nand her mother\xe2\x80\x99s gentle, winning ways, however, soon dispelled the damp\r\nchill that Jane and Lucy\xe2\x80\x99s reserve generally managed to throw over\r\nstrangers, thus before the steamer got under way, all were conversing\r\nand laughing like old friends, discussing things in general and people\r\nin particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have made a conquest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amelia Holman to Alice. \xe2\x80\x9cOr\r\nperhaps two, for I saw a little yellow haired man with a very red neck,\r\ncome this way and look at you. Then a loose jointed fellow who walks as\r\nif his feet are too heavy to lift and just drags them, follows, and he\r\ntoo looks at you beseechingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercy! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be so fascinating as all that might indicate,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Alice, laughing, and a little man gesticulating, and a big man with\r\nshuffling gait and hands in the pockets of his pantaloons, listening\r\nwearily, were seen coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know who they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence. \xe2\x80\x9cThe little one is married, so\r\nAlice can rest her hopes on the big footed one only.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious, how very repulsive the small one is,\xe2\x80\x9d Corina exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are they?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell asked when they had turned to go back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe large fellow is Dick Mason, brother-in-law of the little\r\nred-skinned one, who told me his name is Peter Roper, and he is a lawyer\r\nbound for San Diego to practice law there (no matter by what means), he\r\nsays. He gave me this information himself when I went to check our\r\nbaggage. He introduced himself and his brother Dick on the strength of\r\nhis being acquainted with father. He also asked permission to present\r\nhis wife, to my mother and sisters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you give that permission?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jane, sternly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, of course; but if his skin is not so thick as it is red he will\r\nnever avail himself of it. I noticed he had been drinking, so I told him\r\nthat at present my mother and sisters wished to converse alone with the\r\nMisses Holman, of whom we are the escort, but that before we reached San\r\nDiego I thought there might be an opportunity to present his wife,\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d Alice asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe grinned and said: \xe2\x80\x98Pretty large escort, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? About a dozen\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, I said, but the young ladies are very nice, and require a\r\ngreat deal of attention. \xe2\x80\x98Do they?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and his yellow eyes leered,\r\nand sticking his tongue to one side of his mouth, made his cheek bulge\r\nout; he then raised his shoulders and lifted his elbows, as if he would\r\nhave flown aloft had his arms been wings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow impertinent and vulgar,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is of the genus _hoodlum_. A bird aboriginal of the San Francisco\r\nsand dunes, resembling the peacock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corina Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do when he made those grimaces?\xe2\x80\x9d Alice asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I looked at him as if I expected nothing else, considering\r\nthat it must be natural to him to act like a monkey. My impassibility\r\nrather disconcerted him, as evidently he expected me to consider him\r\nvery funny, and laugh at his droll antics. He added, \xe2\x80\x98Any time will do,\r\nas my wife is not over-anxious to make acquaintances generally.\xe2\x80\x99 So\r\nsaying, he threw back the lappels of his coat, putting his thumbs in the\r\narm-holes of his vest, and strutted off, leaving me to guess whether he\r\nwas making fun of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s exclusiveness or ours. He turned back soon,\r\nthough, and said, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll call it square, if you come and take a drink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhen I declined that also, he went off again, and this time angry in\r\ngood earnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he will remain so, and not come near you again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jane.\r\n\r\nVain wish! When the boat stopped at Santa Barbara, Roper took that\r\nopportunity to present his wife to Mrs. Darrell on the strength of his\r\nacquaintance with her husband. He grinned and suppressed a giggle,\r\nthinking it was very funny to claim friendly relations with Darrell,\r\nwhom he had never seen. It was a matter of perfect indifference to him\r\nthat Mrs. Darrell would find out his falsehood afterward. All that he\r\nwanted now was to become acquainted with the Darrell and Holman ladies.\r\nIn this he succeeded, and what is more, succeeded according to his\r\nprinciples, in utter disregard of truth or self-respect. He trusted to\r\nhis inventive genius to explain how he came to imagine he was acquainted\r\nwith Mr. Darrell.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat arrived at San Diego, Gabriel and Elvira came to the wharf\r\nto meet the Misses Holman. They thanked Clarence for the excellent care\r\nhe had taken of them, and Elvira asked him to present her to his mother\r\nand sisters. This was done with pleasure, and he was glad to see that\r\nElvira and Gabriel seemed pleased with his family.\r\n\r\nThe Holmans would remain in town for a couple of days at a friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, after that they would go to the Alamar rancho to make their visit\r\nthere. Elvira and Gabriel would remain with them to be their escort.\r\nSuch was Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s message home sent with Clarence.\r\n\r\nMr. Darrell came on board to meet his family, but Mr. Peter Roper was\r\ntoo intently occupied with his baggage to renew his acquaintance; in\r\nfact, he rather hurried off the boat to avoid him.\r\n\r\nThe Darrells arrived at the hotel about the same time, but Peter was\r\nthen particularly engaged making important inquiries from one of the\r\nhotel clerks.\r\n\r\nHe was saying: \xe2\x80\x9cSo, you think there is no lawyer of any prominence; not\r\none that might be called a leading lawyer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that; I only said I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. You hear, though, who has the largest practice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you call a large practice to get people into trouble by spying about\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s business and getting commercial agencies (I believe that is\r\nwhat he calls to spy and pry into people\xe2\x80\x99s affairs), then old Hornblower\r\nis the leading lawyer, for he leads people into long law suits always,\r\nand bleeds them and makes money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the man for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roper, showing his purple gums in a broad\r\ngrin, and the orange and green of his eyes expanding with feline\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nRomeo Hancock had been engaged by Clarence before leaving, to take\r\ncharge of hauling their effects to the rancho. Romeo, therefore, was\r\nthere with three large wagons, and two vaqueros to convey Mrs. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npretty Jersey cows. But Clarence had to see that everything started in\r\ngood order before he joined his family at the hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI brought the Concord wagon for the women folks and the light spring\r\nwagon for the boys and Tisha,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Darrell. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Concord holds six\r\npeople well, and at a pinch, eight. The light wagon the same; so you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have to have any extra conveyances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father, I have not hired any,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied, and exchanging a\r\nlook with his brothers, said that everything was ready to start, and all\r\nwalked down stairs.\r\n\r\nIn front of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 entrance was a very handsome carriage which Mrs.\r\nDarrell and her daughters had admired very much on board the steamer;\r\nnext to it was a pretty ph\xc3\xa6ton which they also had admired, and behind\r\nthe ph\xc3\xa6ton was Mr. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s Concord. He frowned and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no use in hiring those carriages, Clarence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount noses, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, going about busily carrying\r\nparcels to the carriages assisted by his brothers, allowing no time for\r\ndiscussion\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see. Mother and father in the back seat; Jane and\r\nLucy in the front, Clementina with Everett, the driver. In the ph\xc3\xa6ton I\r\nwill take Alice, her lap dog and our two satchels, and last but not\r\nleast, Webster will take \xe2\x80\x98the Concord\xe2\x80\x99 with Willie in the front seat and\r\nTisha in the back in state, with the cockatoos and canaries and\r\nparcels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, patting Tisha on the back.\r\n\r\nAll laughed, approving the disposition of forces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre these carriages ours, Clary?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clementine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, lifting her to her place, \xe2\x80\x9cand you\r\nshall see how soon the ph\xc3\xa6ton distances the big carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\xe2\x80\x94_Victoriano and His Sister._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe golden rays of a setting sun were vanishing in the west, and a\r\nsilvered moon was rising serenely over the eastern hills, when the\r\nph\xc3\xa6ton, having distanced the other carriages by a full half hour,\r\nreached the foot of the low hill where the Alamar house stood. The\r\nFrench windows opening upon the front veranda, sent broad streams of\r\nlight across the garden and far over the hill. Sounds of music greeted\r\nAlice and Clarence on their arrival. He checked his horses saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see there are two roads here; one goes directly to our house, while\r\nthe upper one passes close to the gate of the Alamares. I can take the\r\nupper road if you would like to hear the music.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would, indeed, unless it might seem intrusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are too kind hearted to think that, besides, I have a message of\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Elvira to deliver,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, guiding his horses to the left, slowly\r\nclimbing the hill to approach the gate silently. The ph\xc3\xa6ton stood in the\r\npenumbra between the lights of two windows, and it had not been heard.\r\nThe singing had ceased, the prelude of a Spanish song was begun and\r\ninterrupted. The lady at the piano arose and selected another piece of\r\nmusic, and began the accompaniment of the old and well known \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nRemember Sweet Alice, Ben Bolt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that lady?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alice in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is Miss Mercedes,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Clarence, glad of the excuse to\r\nwhisper, and with a preparatory checking of breath and swallowing of\r\nsomething that seemed to fill his throat always, when her name was\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope she will sing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d was the laconic reply, and both waited in silence. Clarence\r\ncould distinctly hear his heart throbs.\r\n\r\nA man\xe2\x80\x99s voice, a fine tenor, began the song. He sang the first stanza so\r\ncorrectly and with so much feeling that it seemed to Clarence that he\r\ncould not have listened to the simple melody before now attentively\r\nenough to appreciate its pathos, for it sounded most sweetly touching to\r\nhim. Only one verse was sung.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought that song capable of so much expression, or Tano\r\ncapable of giving it so well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reason why Victoriano interrupted this song was because Mercedes had\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cSing something else, Tano, that song is too sad. It will give me\r\nthe blues.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe too. Those American songs always speak of death or dying. Ugh! You\r\nsing something lively.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why the Darrells\r\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t come? I suppose they are going to remain in town until\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying he walked to the window. His eyes were too well\r\ntrained to distinguish objects in the darkness not to have quickly\r\nperceived the ph\xc3\xa6ton, though it could not be seen very distinctly. He\r\nsaw it, but thought it must be Gabriel and Elvira returning\r\nunexpectedly. He ran to the gate, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo! What made you return? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the Holmans come? What has\r\nhappened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence answered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Holmans came all safe and sound, and\r\nI delivered them into the hands of Don Gabriel, who, accompanied by Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nElvira, came to meet them. Do\xc3\xb1a Elvira requested me to say that they\r\nwill remain in town a couple of days and then come home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is your family?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Tano, coming to the ph\xc3\xa6ton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are coming, and here is a small part and parcel of the same\xe2\x80\x94called\r\nour sister Alice. Don Victoriano permit me to present Miss Alice\r\nDarrell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Alice, your humble servant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, bowing. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to\r\ngo to the other side of the ph\xc3\xa6ton to try a more graceful bow a little\r\nnearer, and the honor of shaking hands, _a la Americana_\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\nMercedes came now, tripping down in the path, also thinking that their\r\ncarriage had returned, because some accident had happened to somebody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that you, Gabriel?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou come and see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\nShe came close to the ph\xc3\xa6ton, right between the wheels, but still\r\nthinking she saw Gabriel, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened? Ah! it is Mr.\r\nDarrell,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, with a tremor in her voice, that made Clarence\r\nthink she was alarmed.\r\n\r\nHe hastened to reply: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing has happened. Your friends are all safe\r\nand well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Miss Alice Darrell. Can you bow to her in the dark, and shake\r\nhands?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I can, but she might not see my bow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, laughing,\r\nand extended her hand, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to make your acquaintance,\r\nMiss Darrell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence took her hand, as Alice had not seen it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, that hand was for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, putting Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 hand in hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not shake hands with Clarence?\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano. \xe2\x80\x9cI declare,\r\nsolemnly, girls are very ungrateful. Here Clarence has been so sorry,\r\nbecause you hurt your foot, and you have never thanked him for his kind\r\nsympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell has never expressed his kind sympathy to me, how was I to\r\npresume he felt it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe presumption would have been mine had I expressed all I felt,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, taking off his glove, which action she rightly understood to mean\r\nthat he wished to shake hands with her.\r\n\r\nShe extended her hand, and he clasped it in his. That ineffable thrill\r\nwhich he felt for the first time in his life when he lifted her in his\r\narms was now felt again. It coursed through his veins with the warm\r\nblood that rushed to his heart.\r\n\r\nNeither one took any notice of what Victoriano and Alice were saying\r\nuntil they heard him say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right. He is going to be married soon, then he\xe2\x80\x99ll be on the\r\nshelf. That\xe2\x80\x99s a comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will be on the shelf?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel, of course; and I am glad of it, as Miss Alice has just coolly\r\ntold me that he is the handsomest man she ever saw, forgetting that\r\nClarence is here, and poor me, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresent company is always excepted,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice argued; \xe2\x80\x9cand the rule, I\r\nsuppose, applies now, though I cannot well see whether it does or not,\r\nyou being in the dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so. Come out of the shadow.\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t now. I feel too abashed,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will soon recover. His fits of diffidence don\xe2\x80\x99t last long,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he is diffident now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Alice, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that is why I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to tell me that Gabriel is handsome;\r\nit abashes me too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a good reasoner, too, you see that, Miss Darrell; though by\r\nmoonlight his logic shines but dimly. Come, we must not keep Miss\r\nDarrell longer, since they will not come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you might stop and take supper with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, no, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence answered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe came in advance to light the\r\nlamps, and attracted by the music, took the liberty of coming over the\r\nroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry. Then you must have heard me sing. Bah! Mercedes, it is your\r\nfault,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that. You sing very well, only the song is very plaintive,\r\nand the better it is sung, the sadder is its melody,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have seemed like a lugubrious welcome to Miss Alice. I shall\r\nnever sing that song again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cSee if I\r\ndo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear you say that, for you are constantly singing it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMercedes said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope it will not be a prophetic coincidence that you should sing it\r\nas I came,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alice, and as she spoke the supper bell rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the prophecy I meant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, and all laughed, glad\r\nof the timely turn thus given to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this assurance we must go home comforted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, and all\r\nbade each other good night.\r\n\r\nThe lamps were lighted, and the windows and doors opened. The Darrell\r\nhouse looked as if there was an illumination for a national celebration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and see how the house looks from the front outside, all\r\nlighted up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\nThey went out to look at it from the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you build such a nice house, Clary, and how could papa allow\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d Alice said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! You must never speak about the cost of this house or its\r\nfurniture. I have made lots of money in stocks, and can afford it, but\r\nfather thinks stock gambling is next to robbery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes and Victoriano remained for a few moments standing by the gate,\r\nwatching the ph\xc3\xa6ton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! but isn\xe2\x80\x99t she sweet! She has just left me deaf and dumb!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nVictoriano, as the ph\xc3\xa6ton disappeared down the hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are deaf, since you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear the supper bell ringing\r\nagain, but as for being dumb I am sure the greatest beauty on earth\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t produce that effect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you I am, and I will go to see her and tell her so\r\nto-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, following his sister to the supper room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do nothing of the kind. The idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, pray? Clarence told me to call soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he supposed you would have the good taste to wait at least two\r\nor three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days! Three days! Not if I am alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that about being alive?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet him tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I am going to see that sweet little Alice Darrell to-morrow, dead\r\nor alive,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho will be dead or alive?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Carlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI, of course! What a question?\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you could not go there if you were dead, I thought you meant that\r\nyou were to go and see her in that insensible state,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carlota.\r\n\r\nVictoriano looked at his sister reproachfully, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow mean to talk so about that sweet girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was to correct you from expressing yourself in that style of yours,\r\nmixing up things and ideas so incongruously. You ought to take care not\r\nto confuse things so absurdly,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you talk like Gabriel? He always uses good language\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nSpanish or in English,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother Gabriel, and Gabriel, and Gabriel! Everybody throws him at my\r\nteeth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, beginning to eat with very good appetite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe operation don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt your teeth, though,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario, \xe2\x80\x9cto judge\r\nby the very effective manner in which you use them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I do, because I am an amiable good fellow, who bears nobody\r\nill-will, even towards his harassing sisters, and much praised elder\r\nbrother, who is hoisted up to the skies a million times a day for my\r\nspecial edification and good example. It is a good thing, I tell you,\r\nladies and gentlemen, a very fortunate thing, that I am so amiable, and\r\nGabriel so good a fellow, or else I would have punched his head into\r\ncalf\xe2\x80\x99s head-jelly, twice a day, many times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is your confusion of ideas again. You are thinking that yours\r\nmight have been the calf\xe2\x80\x99s head made into jelly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, miss. I meant what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel is very strong and a good boxer,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is again! Sweet Alice says he is the handsomest man she ever\r\nsaw; Lote says he uses beautiful language, and now father implies that\r\nthe fellow could whip me! Give me some more of that chicken _pipian_ to\r\nconsole myself with. Say, mother, why is this delicious chicken stew\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x98_pipian_?\xe2\x80\x99 Because it makes a fellow \xe2\x80\x98_pio_\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98_pio_\xe2\x80\x99 for more?\r\nor because the chicken themselves would cry \xe2\x80\x98_pio_,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98_pio_\xe2\x80\x99, if they\r\nwere to see their persons cooked in this way?\xe2\x80\x9d Without waiting for an\r\nanswer to his question, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI say, mother, arn\xe2\x80\x99t you and the\r\ngirls going to call on the Darrells?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d laconically answered Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we?\xe2\x80\x9d queried Carlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they are neighbors like the Mechlins,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Mathews is our neighbor, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is a thief,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t to steal land robbery?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Carlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Darrells occupy the land they selected, with my consent, so I hope\r\nno one in my family will do them the injustice to say that they have\r\nstolen our land, or that they are squatters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano firmly.\r\nThen added: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not desire any one of you to speak of this matter\r\nwith anybody. Only remember, the Darrells are not squatters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we say, for instance, if the Holmans should notice that we\r\nare very friendly to the Darrells, but not so towards the squatters?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRosario asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the Holmans will be too well-bred to ask questions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are well-bred, but they are very intimate friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario said\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd very inquisitive ones, too,\xe2\x80\x9d added Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRefer them to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give them quite a\r\nsatisfactory answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeantime, are we not to visit them?\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVisit whom?\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Darrells, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you meant the Holmans, as we spoke of them last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother, with your grammar, you had better keep school,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better go to one,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have enough of it here. The question now is the visit to the\r\nDarrells. Is this family to visit them or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are to do so to-morrow, dead or alive,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother! You will call, Mercita, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure, if mamma will permit me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a sweet pussy always, and the best of sisters. Can\xe2\x80\x99t she go,\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, if her father does not object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI not only do not object, but I shall be pleased to have Mercedes and\r\nher mamma and sisters all call, for I think Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s mother must be a\r\nlady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for father, he is a man after my own heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano,\r\nclapping his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa feels proud of your approval,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would suggest that Tano make a _reconnoitering_ visit before Mercedes\r\ngoes, as a leader of a forlorn hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, how military your terms, but how little your courage,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nVictoriano, derisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI admit that I always dread to face squatters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I said that the Darrells are not to be considered squatters nor\r\ncalled so by any Alamar, and I repeat that such is my wish. Moreover,\r\nnot every settler is necessarily a squatter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon. I forgot that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do it again, Rosy Posy, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, rising from the\r\ntable, stroking his sister\xe2\x80\x99s back as if to pacify a fractious colt. Then\r\ngoing to a window, said: \xe2\x80\x9cMercedes come here. Look at that; isn\xe2\x80\x99t that\r\nfountain lovely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the front garden of the Darrell house, opposite to the front door and\r\nsurrounded by flowers and choice plants, Clarence had erected a fountain\r\nwhich was to emit its numerous jets of chrystaline water for the first\r\ntime, when his mother should drive up to the door. She had done so, and\r\nthe fountain was sending upwards its jets of diamonds under the rays of\r\nthe reflectors at the front door. The effect was pretty and brilliant.\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s filial love was sweetly expressed in the music of the\r\nfountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\xe2\x80\x94_Clarence is the Bearer of Joyful News._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Darrell family had been the happy dwellers of their fine house on\r\nthe Alamar rancho for nearly two months, and the three Misses Holman had\r\nbeen the guests of the Alamar family for the same length of time, and\r\nnow the month of September, 1872, had arrived.\r\n\r\nThe awnings at the east and south side of the front veranda were down,\r\nand in that deliciously cool place, the favorite resort of the Alamar\r\nladies, they now sat with their guests\xe2\x80\x94the Holmans\xe2\x80\x94engaged in different\r\nkinds of fancy work, the greater portion of which was intended to be\r\nwedding presents for Elvira and Lizzie Mechlin, who were to be married\r\nin a few months.\r\n\r\nMercedes was the only one not at work. She was reclining on a hammock,\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArn\xe2\x80\x99t you going to work anything for the girls, Mercedes?\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich girls?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes asked, with her eyes fixed on her book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizzie and Elvira, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will when the wedding day is fixed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will soon be, when George arrives,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be time enough for my work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, looking from her\r\nbook down the valley, towards the Darrell house, as if casually\r\nobserving from under the awning the green meadows below.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you come here? The back veranda is entirely shaded, and much\r\ncooler. I have been waiting for you there. Pshaw!\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano,\r\ncoming forward and stretching open a hammock to throw himself into it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad we known that, we would all have rushed there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corina Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a perfect stampede,\xe2\x80\x9d added Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had gone with your father,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he said he might stay to lunch at aunt\xe2\x80\x99s. It is too hot a day to be\r\nriding about in the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, after having been in the moon for two months the change of\r\ntemperature might hurt you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amelia Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact; I have been in the moon ever since _you_ came,\xe2\x80\x9d assented\r\nVictoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour moon stays in the valley, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rise to this level,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nAmelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a lovely moon wherever it may shine. I say, Baby, won\xe2\x80\x99t you go\r\nwith me to the Darrells this evening?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, addressing Mercedes,\r\nwho had made no reply, for the reason that she had just seen Clarence\r\ncoming on horseback, and, as usual, when any one spoke of him, or she\r\nunexpectedly saw him, she found it necessary to take a little time, in\r\norder to steady her voice, which otherwise might betray her heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntumult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes\xe2\x80\x99 French novel must be very interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a novel\xe2\x80\x94it is French History,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madam Halier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes, Tano wants you to escort him this evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you take him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes asked, without moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Corina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe means to the third heaven,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, the God of Love is truly miraculous. I think it could even\r\npoetize the Pittikin girls, or the Hughes, in Tano\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nCarlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk of the angels, and you hear the clatter of their hoofs,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nRosario; \xe2\x80\x9cthere he is at the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis awning is too low\xe2\x80\x94we don\xe2\x80\x99t see people until they are upon us,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Carlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am off. I suppose he will stay to lunch, that will give me all I want\r\nof his charming society,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario, rising to go as Clarence\r\ndismounted at the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, he has seen us all; it would be discourteous to leave now,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa, and Rosario remained.\r\n\r\nVictoriano jumped out of the hammock to meet Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHallo, yourself and welcome! Any news?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _big_ news,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied, blushing crimson,\xe2\x80\x94not at the news\r\nhe brought, as one might have supposed,\xe2\x80\x94but because he had just seen two\r\nlittle feet, in a tiny pair of slippers, with blue rosettes, which he\r\nwell knew. These little blue rosettes had set his heart to beating,\r\nsending more than the normal amount of blood to his head.\r\n\r\nOn leaving her hammock to take a chair Mercedes had shown those\r\ntantalizing tip ends of her slippers, half hidden in a mass of lace\r\nruffles. That was all, and yet poor Clarence was disconcerted, and\r\nbecame more and more so, on perceiving that there were not less than\r\nnine ladies on that veranda; nine pairs of eyes which had undoubtedly\r\nobserved his own, devouring the blue rosettes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the news, pray? Don\xe2\x80\x99t kill us with suspense,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Miss\r\nCorina Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe news is that Colonel Scott has arrived at San Francisco, and will\r\nbe in San Diego next week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Victoriano, \xe2\x80\x9cnow we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you make that out?\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind how, we\xe2\x80\x99ll not go into particulars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, better not,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario advised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa will be so glad to hear this news,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, \xe2\x80\x9cand Mr.\r\nHolman, also. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come down now, will he not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, father will come down with Col. Scott, and may be build us a house\r\nright away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amelia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is papa now; I am so glad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must run with the news to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, rushing madly\r\nthrough the hall, to the _patio_, or court, where Don Mariano had just\r\ndismounted.\r\n\r\nThe news was so gladdening to Don Mariano, that he came immediately to\r\npropose to the young ladies to have a dance that evening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where are the gentlemen? There are plenty of ladies, but unless you\r\ninvite squatters\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Rosario began, but Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa stopped her with a\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, counting on his fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are\r\nthree or four Darrells, and six or eight Alamares, if my brothers and\r\nhalf of my nephews come. That ought to be enough, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty. I\xe2\x80\x99ll send a vaquero to aunt\xe2\x80\x99s to call the boys, and you bring\r\nyour brothers and sisters, Clarence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d was Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere will surely be some fellows from town this evening, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake them stay,\xe2\x80\x9d added Victoriano.\r\n\r\nThe dance took place and was followed by many others. The Alamar family\r\nwere very hospitable, and had many visitors, who were only too glad to\r\nspend their evenings, dancing with charming and refined young ladies,\r\nwhose society was certainly most attractive.\r\n\r\nThere were several young gentlemen from the Eastern States stopping at\r\nthe principal hotel in San Diego, and they came to Alamar almost daily,\r\nto have a dance, or picnic, or musicale, or a card party.\r\n\r\nThese gayeties were not confined to the Alamar and Mechlin and Darrell\r\nfamilies, nor was the Alamar rancho only made happy because Tom Scott\r\nwas coming. The entire county of San Diego was buoyed up with hopes of\r\nprosperity, which now seemed founded upon a solid basis.\r\n\r\nAs for the town of San Diego itself, the dwarfed and stunted little\r\ncity, she went crazy with joy. Her joy, however, was not of the\r\nboisterous, uproarious kind, it was of a mild character, which smiles at\r\neverybody, and takes all that comes in good part, ready always to join\r\nin the laugh on herself, provided everybody enjoys it. She was happy,\r\nseeing a broad vista of coming prosperity in the near future. Why not?\r\nShe had every reason and every right to expect that the Texas Pacific\r\nwould be built.\r\n\r\nAt last, Col. Scott arrived, and drove to the principal hotel, where a\r\ndeputation of the most prominent citizens immediately waited on him to\r\npay their respects, and learn his wishes as to how his time should be\r\noccupied during his stay in San Diego. The city desired to honor the\r\ndistinguished guest with liberal hospitality, but the business of the\r\nrailroad was the main point in view. There were speeches to be made at\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArmory Hall,\xe2\x80\x9d with meetings and consultations to be had at nights,\r\nbesides drives to examine the town site and surrounding country during\r\nthe day. The ladies wished to give him a ball, but the business men said\r\nTom Scott did not come to dance, he came to work. There was a banquet\r\ngiven to him, but no ladies were present, only men, and plenty of\r\nrailroad speeches. The ladies could only meet him at private receptions\r\nin the evening, when he was tired out with driving. Yet, this was the\r\nbest that could be done, as his time was limited. But he was amiable,\r\nthe ladies were amiable, and the gentlemen were amiable. So the little\r\ncity of San Diego gave all she had to give; all the lands that had\r\nbelonged to the old \xe2\x80\x9cSan Diego & Gila R. R. Co.,\xe2\x80\x9d all that had been\r\ntransferred to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Memphis & El Paso R. R. Co.,\xe2\x80\x9d all the town lands,\r\nwater front and rights of way that could by any means be obtained, all\r\nwas most generously proffered, adding more lands than those originally\r\ngiven to the road under the old names of \xe2\x80\x9cThe San Diego & Gila Railroad\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9cThe Memphis & El Paso Railroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCol. Scott left well satisfied with the people of San Diego, and the\r\npeople were charmed with Col. Scott. Speculation then ran wild. Town\r\nlots were bought and sold at fancy prices, but in the madness of the\r\nhour folly seemed wisdom.\r\n\r\nAmong the heaviest investors, Don Mariano Alamar, Mr. James Mechlin, and\r\nMr. Alfred Holman were the most prominent. They bought block after block\r\nof building lots, and only stopped when their money was all invested.\r\nClarence also bought a few blocks, and George and Gabriel risked all\r\nthey dared. Many other people followed this (which proved to be\r\ndisastrous) example, and then all sat down to wait for the railroad to\r\nbring population and prosperity.\r\n\r\n                                  \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe day of the double wedding which was to tie together (with a double\r\nloop) the Alamar and Mechlin families, was set for the 24th of May,\r\n1873. On that day Gabriel and George would lead to the altar their\r\nrespective sisters, Lizzie and Elvira.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano wished to celebrate that double wedding in the same\r\nold-fashioned way in which his own had been solemnized. He wanted at\r\nleast three days of good eating and drinking, and dancing; to have noise\r\nand boat racing; to have a day\xe2\x80\x99s sailing on the bay, and a day\xe2\x80\x99s picnic\r\nin the woods, to which picnic even the stubborn, hostile squatters\r\nshould be invited. But with the sole exception of Victoriano, no one of\r\nhis family approved this programme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid my dear husband that we are too closely surrounded by\r\nAmericans for us to indulge in our old-fashioned rejoicings,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe would be laughed at,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho cares for that?\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano asked, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the right thinking and kind-hearted Americans\r\nwould say anything, except that such is customary among us. But if\r\nGeorge and Gabriel desire to run off in the steamer, as though they were\r\nashamed of matrimony, I say let them have their way. But they will have\r\na wedding that will look like a funeral,\xe2\x80\x9d said the disappointed Don\r\nMariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge and Gabriel are willing to have their wedding celebrated as you\r\npropose, but it is the girls that object; they wished to run off and\r\nhide for a month in a fashionable hotel in San Francisco; afterward they\r\ncame to the conclusion that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to a hotel, so\r\nGabriel proposed that they will take the steamer that goes to Mazatlan\r\nand Guaymas and La Paz, thus to visit all of those places on their\r\nwedding tour,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs George had been wishing to see the\r\nMexican coast, this plan suited all very well, and George has written to\r\nhave the steamer stop for them on her way south,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano explained,\r\nhalf apologetically, half resentfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all right; if they are satisfied I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano,\r\nphilosophically, with characteristic amiability.\r\n\r\nThe steamer running between San Francisco and the Mexican ports on the\r\nGulf of California stopped at San Diego to take the newly married\r\ncouples; a large party of friends escorted them on board.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano was kind and affable to all, but many days passed before he\r\nbecame reconciled to the fact that the marriage of his two children was\r\nnot celebrated as his own had been, in the good old times of yore.\r\n\r\nThe brides and grooms had been gone for some time, and might now be\r\ncoming back in a few days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad we three are alone, for there is something of which I wish to\r\nspeak with you two when no one of the family is with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa to Carlota and Rosario, as they sat in their favorite front\r\nveranda, sewing.\r\n\r\nThe girls looked up, and casting a quick glance to see whether any one\r\nwas approaching, waited to hear what their mother had to say. The\r\nawnings being only half down no one could come from the outside\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota asked, seeing that her mother seemed to\r\nhesitate; \xe2\x80\x9canything unpleasant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, no\xe2\x80\x94yes. That is to say, to me it is, very. Have you noticed\r\nMercedes\xe2\x80\x99 manner lately? She seems absorbed, silent, thoughtful, sad,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94you know what I fear. She says she is not sick, then it is some\r\nmental trouble, I am sure. So, then, I have been thinking that she had\r\nbetter go with Elvira and visit New York for a while, the change will do\r\nher good. I do not approve of young girls going from home on visits, but\r\nas she will go with her married sister, and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94I hope it will be for\r\nher good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it may not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, if it is as you\xe2\x80\x94as we three\xe2\x80\x94fear, absence might be worse for\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x9d added Rosario; \xe2\x80\x9cMercedes is very gentle, but she is very loving\r\nand constant, so it might do more harm than good to send her away now.\r\nRemember what the poet says about it:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98La ausencia es para el amor\r\n    Lo que el aire para el fuego;\r\n    Si es poco, lo apaga luego,\r\n    Si es grande, lo hace mayor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nand I fear that Mercedes is too deeply interested already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so. Have you spoken to papa about it?\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mentioned it only once, knowing his partiality to Clarence,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might be partial, but when it comes to the danger of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmarrying a _squatter_ I should think there would be a limit to\r\npartiality,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said, warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear your father views the matter differently. The one time I\r\nmentioned to him that Clarence seemed to be more and more in love with\r\nMercedes, and my fear that she also liked him more than I care to\r\nbelieve. He said, \xe2\x80\x98Has he made love or proposed to her?\xe2\x80\x99 I told him I\r\nhoped he had not been so audacious as that. \xe2\x80\x98Audacious!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and\r\nlaughed. \xe2\x80\x98I tell you, wife, if all that is necessary for Clarence to\r\npropose be courage, neither you nor I can stop him, for the boy is no\r\ncoward. I reckon that it is Mercedes herself who gives him no\r\nencouragement; that is what deters him, but none of our _sangre azul_,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand he laughed again. I said to him, you take very coolly a matter that\r\nmight be a question of our child\xe2\x80\x99s fate for life, but he only appeared\r\namused at my anxiety. He said: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t borrow trouble; Clarence is a most\r\nexcellent young fellow\xe2\x80\x94bright, energetic and honorable. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother\r\nthem or yourself; if they feel true love they have a right to it. Trust\r\nhim, he is all right.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a squatter! The idea of an Alamar marrying a squatter! For\r\nsquatters they are, though we dance with them,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nshocked at papa\xe2\x80\x99s partiality. I must say yes, mamma, send poor Mercita\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; with all due respect to papa, I fear I will not be reconciled to\r\nthe idea of Mercedes being a daughter-in-law of old Darrell,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario\r\nsaid, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither could I,\xe2\x80\x9d added Carlota.\r\n\r\nAnd thus felt and thus reasoned these proud ladies _in those days_. For\r\nalthough the shadows of black clouds were falling all around, they had\r\nnot observed them, or suspected their proximity; they held up their\r\nheads proudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has Clarence the means of supporting a wife?\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\r\nis another question to be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I heard he had made money in stocks, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nmuch,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no faith in stocks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us not mention this to Mercedes yet. When Elvira returns we will\r\nconsult with her,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said.\r\n\r\nNothing was said to Mercedes about her journey, but she was never\r\nallowed to see Clarence alone.\r\n\r\nElvira returned, and the project mentioned to her. She, as a matter of\r\ncourse, was delighted at the prospect of having her favorite sister with\r\nher. The pain of leaving her home would be lessened in her company.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, when Elvira was alone in her room, Mercedes came in,\r\nlooking rather pale, and letting herself drop into the first chair she\r\ncame to, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this unexpected news about my going to New York with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood news, I think. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. But it is too sudden. Why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t mamma thought of it\r\nbefore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she did not think your health required any change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what, mamma alarms herself unnecessarily, and puts but poor\r\nreliance on me. I understand it all, but as a trip to New York is a most\r\ndelightful medicine, I am willing to take it, and that she should\r\nconsider my health in a precarious state.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you _do_ look pale and thin, Mercita.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been keeping late hours, and\r\ndancing too much. If I go to bed early I shall get back my good color\r\nand flesh again. However, I am glad to play the invalid until I get on\r\nboard the cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be alarmed for you, too, until we get off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes laughed, and went to her room singing, but once there her\r\ngayety vanished. She locked her door, and threw herself on the bed,\r\nburying her face in her pillow to stifle her sobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan anything tear his image from my heart? No. Nothing! nothing! They\r\nmay send me away to the other end of the world, they shall not part us,\r\nfor you will still fill my heart, my own darling, holding my very soul\r\nforever in full possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes, being not quite seventeen, her grief at parting from Clarence\r\nwas wild, vehement and all-absorbing. But she had been trained to\r\nobedience, and her battles with the spirit always took place after she\r\ncarefully locked her bedroom door. Then Clarence was wildly\r\napostrophized, and a torrent of tears relieved the overcharged, aching\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe day of departure arrived, and she had not had one minute\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconversation alone with Clarence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\xe2\x80\x94_But Clarence Must Not be Encouraged._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wharf was over-crowded. The steamer was about to leave. The last\r\ncar-load of baggage had been quickly shipped, and Clarence had not been\r\nable to say a word to Mercedes which might not have been heard by the\r\npersons surrounding her. He was pale and desperate. He had gone on board\r\nthe steamer just to ask her one question, but she had never been alone\r\nfor an instant. And thus they must part,\xe2\x80\x94for the embodied \xe2\x80\x9c_Fuerza del\r\ndestino_\xe2\x80\x9d now came in the shape of a boy clanging in deafening clatter a\r\nmost discordant bell, saying that those who were not going on the\r\nsteamer must go ashore. A hurried hand-shaking, and the troop of friends\r\nmarched down the gang-plank to turn round and look many more tender\r\nadieus from the wharf.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano had observed Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s deathly pallor, and how faithfully\r\nit was reflected on Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 face; he saw the unhappy young man\r\nstanding aloof from the crowd on the extreme edge of the wharf. He went\r\nto him, and laying his hand gently on his shoulder, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat position is dangerous\xe2\x80\x94you might lose your balance,\xe2\x80\x9d and he pulled\r\nhim gently away. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are very pale. I fear, my dear boy, that you are\r\nmore troubled than you have admitted to any one. What is it? Tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence shook his head, but suppressing his emotion, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot express my misery. She is sent away that I may not even have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing her. No one can love her as I do, impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you not spoken to me of this before?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Mariano,\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I did not dare. I thought of doing so a thousand times, but did\r\nnot dare. I did not fear unkindness or rejection from _you_, but from\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa and the young ladies I did, and I have never had an\r\nopportunity to speak alone to Miss Mercedes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was an additional reason for speaking to me. Cheer up. \xe2\x80\x98_Faint\r\nheart never won fair lady._\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me that again. Say you do not reject me, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll jump aboard and\r\nfollow her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not reject you, and I repeat what I said, follow her if you wish,\r\nand try your luck. I want to see you both happy, and both of you are\r\nvery unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence looked toward the boat. The gang-plank had been removed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a happy girl you are, Mercedes, to visit New York. How I wish I,\r\ntoo, could go,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard Corina Holman say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, it is not too late yet,\xe2\x80\x9d George replied.\r\n\r\nClarence looked up, and met Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. It seemed as if George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords were intended for him.\r\n\r\nHe clasped Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s hand, saying hurriedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I understand you, I have your permission to go. May I? Tell me\r\n\xe2\x80\x98yes.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Faint heart never won fair lady_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, smiling, and\r\nreturning the warm pressure of his hand, added: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, go and try your\r\nluck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence turned, and without another word quickly made his way through\r\nthe crowd.\r\n\r\nThe steamer\xe2\x80\x99s wheels began to move; the captain was already on the\r\nbridge, over the starboard wheel, and had given the order to let go the\r\nhawsers. In another instant the steamer would leave the wharf.\r\n\r\nClarence felt himself pulled by the arm, he turned impatiently, and met\r\nEverett, who handed him two telegrams, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have looked for you everywhere. These telegrams followed each other\r\nquickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, taking them; adding, without stopping his\r\nhurried walking, \xe2\x80\x9cRetty, I am going. Tell them at home I got three\r\ntelegrams calling me to San Francisco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you haven\xe2\x80\x99t read them,\xe2\x80\x9d urged Everett, trying to follow him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know what they are; I have another in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLifting his arm with the telegrams in his hand, he said to the captain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, one moment. I must go north. Please take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe captain did not hear him, and at the same time called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet go that hawser! Do you want it to snap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe crowd ran off, giving a wide berth to the heavy rope, which now, by\r\nits own tension, made it impossible to be slipped off the pile, although\r\nmany pairs of hands were tugging at it manfully.\r\n\r\nThe stern expression of the captain\xe2\x80\x99s face softened as he saw Clarence\r\nstanding on the brink of the wharf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStep back, Mr. Darrell, quickly, the rope might part,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; but\r\nnoticing that Clarence desired to speak to him, motioned to the first\r\nofficer to take his place, and ran down to hear what Clarence said.\r\n\r\nA minute after the steamer stood still for an instant, then the wheels\r\nbegan to revolve in reversed motion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere she is, Mr. Darrell; she\xe2\x80\x99ll be alongside in a minute,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ncaptain said, pleased with the opportunity to oblige Clarence.\r\n\r\nAnd the steamer, propelled by one wheel, began to back as if with the\r\nside-long motion of a highly intelligent crab who understood the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRead your telegrams,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right\xe2\x80\x94to please you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, tearing them open. Adding,\r\nafter reading a few words, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is as I expected. I am wanted by Hubert.\r\nSend him a dispatch to-night saying I left, and to accept M.\xe2\x80\x99s offer,\r\nand pay the money at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Darrell, come on,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain said.\r\n\r\nHurriedly Clarence shook hands with Don Mariano, Gabriel, Everett and\r\nVictoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, jump in on the downward swing, when about on a level with\r\nthe wharf,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\r\nClarence nodded, gave him his hand, and planting his foot firmly on the\r\nwharf, gave one spring, and wiry as a cat, alighted on the steamer\r\nbeside the captain, who hugged him, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, my boy, I could have done that twenty years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano and Gabriel lifted their hats in congratulatory salutation;\r\nVictoriano and Everett twirled theirs in the air hurrahing; the ladies\r\nwaved their handkerchiefs, and the steamer giving a dip and a plunge\xe2\x80\x94by\r\nway of a very low courtesy\xe2\x80\x94bounded up and started onwards, as if\r\nsatisfied she had been good natured long enough, and now must attend to\r\nbusiness. In a few minutes she had made up for lost time, and was\r\nheading for Ballast Point, leaving San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s shore to be merged into\r\nthe blue hills of Mexico beyond, as if obeying the immutable law which\r\nsays that all things must revert to their original source.\r\n\r\nElvira\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful eyes were so filled with tears that she could see\r\nnothing. Still, she kept her gaze riveted upon that fast receding wharf.\r\nGeorge stood a few feet apart, prudently thinking that the two sisters\r\nwould perhaps prefer to be by themselves while taking their last look at\r\nthe dear ones standing on the wharf. He, too, felt much moved; he would\r\nhave preferred to remain with his family at Alamar. He would come next\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x94he thought\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps remain in California permanently. With this\r\nthought in his mind, almost shaped into resolve, he came to Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside, and quietly slipping his arm round her waist, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t cry, sweetest, I will bring you back next year, and we will make\r\nour home near our parents. No matter if I make less money, we will have\r\nmore happiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElvira looked unutterable thanks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear him, Mercedes?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and Mercedes nodded, but moved a\r\nlittle further off, not yet trusting her voice to make any reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, this won\xe2\x80\x99t do; this will spoil our blue eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d said George,\r\nputting his other arm around Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 pretty shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cI insist upon\r\nyou turning your thoughts toward New York, Long Branch, Newport and\r\nWashington; think of all the fun we will have visiting all those places.\r\nThen we will come back gay and happy, and our dear ones will be so glad\r\nto see us again. Think of all that,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus George exerted his\r\neloquence to administer consolation. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure all at home will be\r\nthinking of our return by to-morrow morning,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, by way of climax\r\nto his consoling rhetoric.\r\n\r\nBut George was mistaken. The Alamar ladies found it very hard and\r\ndifficult to reconcile themselves to be separated from Elvira and\r\nMercedes.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Clarence had gone in the same steamer, added much\r\nbitterness to Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa\xe2\x80\x99s sorrow at separating from both daughters.\r\nShe did not even wish any one to mention Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s name in her\r\npresence. Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in favor of the bold young man were at\r\nfirst ineffectual, but after a while she began to think that she ought\r\nto trust more in Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 pride and Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s vigilance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the travelers continued their voyage very happily.\r\nClarence rightly conjectured that Mercedes would suppose he had followed\r\nher to declare his love, and this supposition would redouble her\r\nshyness. Her manner at first, fully confirmed this surmise, so, to put\r\nher at her ease, he was very kind and attentive, but never betrayed by\r\nword or look, his heart\xe2\x80\x99s devotion. His manner was exactly all that she\r\ncould wish, the behavior of a devoted brother, and in consequence she\r\nbegan to be less shy. He spoke of having received three telegrams,\r\ncalling him north; this surely was a good reason for his unexpected\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThey visited Los Angeles, went ashore at Port Harford and Santa Barbara,\r\nand as George was naturally devoted to his bride, there seemed no\r\nalternative for Mercedes but to accept Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s escort, and lean on\r\nhis arm whenever that operation became necessary.\r\n\r\nThe nights were lovely, with a full moon in the azure sky, and the sea\r\nair, neither cold nor warm, but of that California temperature, which\r\nseems to invite people to be happy, giving to all an idea of the perfect\r\nwell-being we expect to find in the hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of freight to be landed at Santa Barbara. The\r\npassengers going to San Francisco were already on board. Still the\r\nsteamer tarried. Some lady friends of Elvira, who were going north had\r\ncome aboard, and as they had much to say, took her away to their\r\nstaterooms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait for me here, I\xe2\x80\x99ll return in half an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to George; but\r\nhe thought he knew how ladies measure time when engaged in talking, so\r\nhe slowly arose and said he would go to play cribbage with the captain.\r\n\r\nThe steamer now shivered and trembled, as if awakening from a nice nap.\r\nThe wheels revolved lazily and then she was off, dragging a luminous\r\nwake of myriads of evanescent diamonds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you wish to go, Mr. Darrell, please do so; do not remain on my\r\naccount,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, when George rose to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. I remain entirely on my own, as I do not particularly\r\ndesire to play cut-throat cribbage, and as it is too early for you to\r\nretire, suppose you permit me to remain until your sister returns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, do so, else I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave I offended you in any way?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, of course not. What a question. What makes you ask that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you must know it would be cruel punishment to send me off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anything of the kind, only I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be selfish\r\nand keep you from going if you wished it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I wish to go anywhere and leave you; I would not go to\r\nheaven, if to do so I would have to renounce you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do not talk like that, some one might hear you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not a soul within hearing. Our only witness is that lovely\r\nmoon, and she will not betray.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter, please do not speak like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike what? That I love you? I have never yet said it in words, but you\r\nknow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mr. Darrell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you know it, and to avoid me you are going away; going from me, no\r\nmatter if it killed me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my choice, I only obey,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, clasping her trembling\r\nhands, now cold as ice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it so? Did you not wish to avoid me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do not ask me, you\xe2\x80\x99ll make me very miserable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not cause you one single pang, if to avoid it I had to die.\r\nBelieve me, all I wish to know is, whether I have been so blind as not\r\nto see your dislike; whether it was your own choice to go, or you were\r\ncompelled to do so by your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t blame mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not blame her in the least. She has a perfect right to object to\r\nme if she wishes, but I too, have at least, the sad privilege of asking\r\nwhether you also object to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing against you; I like you very much, as\xe2\x80\x94as a friend,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, trembling, painfully agitated.\r\n\r\nClarence laughed a hoarse, discordant laugh that made her feel\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been told that young ladies say that always, when they mean to\r\nlet down easily a poor devil whom they pity and perhaps despise. Thanks,\r\nMiss Mercedes, for liking me \xe2\x80\x98as a friend,\xe2\x80\x99 thank you. Perhaps I am a\r\npresumptuous fool to love you, but love you I must, for I can not help\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood up and looked down at the dark ocean in silence. She looked up\r\nto his face and her beautiful features looked so pleadingly sad, that he\r\nforgot his own misery and thought only of the pain those superb eyes\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nHe seated himself very near her, and took both of her hands in his own.\r\nSurely there was something troubling her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow cold these dear little hands are. Have I caused you pain?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nasked. She nodded but did not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have pained you, when I would give my heart\xe2\x80\x99s blood to make you\r\nhappy. Oh! Mercedes, I cannot give you up, it is impossible while I\r\nlive. Do you command me to do so? Do you wish it? You know that I have\r\nloved you from the first moment I saw you; when I lifted you in my arms.\r\nThe exquisite pleasure I felt then, and the yearning I have felt ever\r\nsince, to hold you in my arms again, as my own sweet wife, that longing\r\ntells me incessantly that I can never love any one else; that I must win\r\nyou or renounce love forever on earth. Tell me, will you cruelly repel\r\nme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent, listening with averted face, as if afraid to meet his\r\ngaze, but she did not withdraw her hands, which he still held in both\r\nhis own, as if he would never willingly release them again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes, say that you reject me only to obey your mother, and I will\r\nnot despair, for I know that your father does not object to me; on the\r\ncontrary, he sanctions my love, he would accept me as his son-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned quickly, gazed at him with an eager, inquiring look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he gave me permission to follow you and ask you to be my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? He? My papa did that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. When he saw me looking so wretched with the pain of parting from\r\nyou, he said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Cheer up; faint heart never won fair lady.\xe2\x80\x99 I said\r\nto him, if you tell me that in earnest, I\xe2\x80\x99ll jump aboard the steamer and\r\nfollow her. He repeated the quotation, adding: \xe2\x80\x98Go and try your luck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nIs not that sufficient?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling papa, he is so kind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, eluding Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s question,\r\nbut her evident gratitude toward her father spoke volumes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed he is. His heart is full of nobility. He does not permit unjust\r\nprejudices to influence him into dislikes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not blame my poor mamma. She thinks you did some wrong act,\r\nbut she is not prejudiced against you, nor does she dislike you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did some wrong act? What is it? When?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, for I do not know, and perhaps I am wrong to\r\nhave said so much. But I spoke because it was painful to me to think\r\nthat you believe my own loving, lovely mamma prejudiced, for she is not.\r\nShe might be mistaken, but she is kindness itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence mentally demurred to this warm praise, but wisely held his\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromise me you will not think mamma is prejudiced,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, without\r\nthe least suspicion of the tyranny, the unreasonableness of such a\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI promise it, of course, if you desire it, but I would at the same\r\ntime, like to know what is the _wrong_ act of which I am accused, that\r\nhas brought upon me her censure. I assure you I have not the slightest\r\nidea; I think my record as an honest man can well bear scrutiny. Can it\r\nbe that I have made money in mining stocks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. She does not know that, and if she did, she would not think it\r\nwrong, for she knows nothing about stocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I vow I have not the remotest idea of what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink no more about it now, and when you return, you ask papa. He will\r\nsoon find out the mistake and vindicate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he will do so I am sure. I would blindly trust my life and honor\r\nin his hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, warmly, and quick as a flash came his reward,\r\nfor she pressed his hands most gratefully. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mercedes why did you do\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d The poor young man was trying to make up his mind not to press\r\nhis suit until he had been vindicated, and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa had nothing\r\nagainst him. But that pressure made him ambitious, impatient; he wished\r\nto have some promise that she would not accept any one else\xe2\x80\x99s suit. She\r\nwas going from him, out of his sight. He was certain that dozens, yes\r\nhundreds, would fall in love with her as soon as they saw her. Would she\r\nnot love some one? It would be natural to prefer to him, some of those\r\nelegant New Yorkers, or some fascinating foreigner whom she might meet\r\nin Washington. This thought made him wretched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you appreciate papa,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, withdrawing her hands,\r\nwhich she considered he had held long enough. Noticing that he looked\r\ntroubled, and that his hand trembled, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cI fear I have been\r\nindiscreet, and have caused you pain by what I said; if so, I am very\r\nsorry. Have I pained you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never done anything dishonorable. I can prove that to Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa at any time. But\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he broke off, and after a paused, added: \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\r\nMercedes! how wretched I shall be, thinking that you might love some one\r\nelse. Is not your refusal to give me any encouragement a proof that you\r\nfeel you never can care for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I do care for you. That is, I mean, I ought not\r\nto tell you so, but\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she did not finish, for the rash young man had\r\nagain seized her little hands, and was covering them with kisses,\r\nforgetting that any passenger had the right to come and sit there on the\r\nsame bench to enjoy the silvery moonlight, sailing over the broad,\r\nsublime Pacific.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mr. Darrell! Don\xe2\x80\x99t do that. Please let us go now to call Elvira.\r\nShe thinks George is with me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want Elvira, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want George. Let them be. Why do you\r\ngrudge me this happiness of being alone with you for the first and,\r\nperhaps, for the last time in my life? Please sit down. I will behave\r\nmyself. I will not kiss your hands, I promise; but won\xe2\x80\x99t you reward my\r\nself-restraint by answering one question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the question?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, sitting down again, only a little\r\nfurther off; \xe2\x80\x9ctell me, and then we must go to find Elvira.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to tell me\xe2\x80\x94I mean, I beg and entreat you to tell me this\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nI can prove that I have never done anything dishonorable, and your\r\nmother ceases to object to my marrying you, will you then consent to be\r\nmy wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe question gave Mercedes exquisite pleasure, for she loved him with\r\nall her heart. The word wife soundly so sweetly coming from his lips,\r\nbut she had promised her mother \xe2\x80\x9c_not to encourage him_.\xe2\x80\x9d So she must\r\nnot. It would be dishonorable to break her word. What could she say, not\r\nto make him unhappy, and yet not commit the sin of disobedience to her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s command?\r\n\r\nShe looked down, and her expressive features again showed that she was\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I was mistaken. Your silence tells me I cannot hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be impatient, please. I was trying to think how I could explain\r\nto you my position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour position?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. How much what papa said to you might alter things. But I cannot\r\nsee how I can say anything to you, except to be patient. Yes, let us\r\nboth be patient.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience and despair do not travel together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDiscard despair, and trust to patience, and\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she was going to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrust me,\xe2\x80\x9d but remembered her mother\xe2\x80\x99s commands, and that to say so\r\nmuch even would be _to encourage him_. She was silent. She could have\r\nrejected an offer of marriage easily without taking away all hope, but\r\nas she \xe2\x80\x9c_must not encourage him_,\xe2\x80\x9d that was the most difficult dilemma\r\nfor the poor girl. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust to papa, and\xe2\x80\x94and do not be blaming me in your\r\nheart. I cannot bear that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not blame you. I shall do whatever you order me. But at all\r\ntimes I do not understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because my position is so\xe2\x80\x94so difficult, so unnatural. I wish you\r\ncould understand it without my explaining it. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in most dejected tones, again thinking of the\r\nelegant New Yorkers, and fascinating Washingtonians, on their knees\r\nbefore her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not understand why you refuse me one word of\r\nencouragement.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! that is just _the word_ I cannot give,\xe2\x80\x9d she sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is all the work of Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa,\xe2\x80\x9d thought he, and the form of the\r\nhandsome matron seemed to rise before him from the billows of the\r\nPacific, and stand with Juno\xe2\x80\x99s lofty majesty in severe impassibility\r\nbefore his sad gaze.\r\n\r\nMercedes, too, was looking at the immense sea, as if trying to discover\r\nin that vast expanse some consoling words that a good, obedient daughter\r\nmight speak on such an occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\xe2\x80\x94_George is a Christian Gentleman._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn vain did Mercedes scan the broad bosom of the Pacific Ocean in search\r\nof something to say that would be soothing to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, very\r\nproper for her to utter, and very acceptable to her mamma\xe2\x80\x99s sentiments,\r\nhad she been there to hear it. But that vast sea was dark and mute. It\r\ndid not respond. It only made her shudder to think of its awful silence\r\nthat was so solemn, but not in the least comforting. It was so dark, so\r\nlimitless, so cold. She turned her eyes to the luminous wake trailed by\r\nthe steamer where such wealth of diamonds was wasted. \xe2\x80\x9cFitful\r\nscintillations and then all lost in gloom,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, all\r\nis not wasted, those bright diamonds are not as evanescent as we, they\r\nwill sink, but reappear again and remain there always to gladden or\r\namuse poor travelers for ages to come; yes, when our two poor hearts\r\nhave ceased forever to throb with joy or pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not, then, wrong when life is so flitting to refuse pure and holy\r\nhappiness which God has permitted to the children of man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will be talking bookish, like Corina Holman, if we sit here alone\r\nwith the silent Pacific. Let us go to find Elvira,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, rising.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there she is now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nElvira was bidding good night to her two lady friends who stood at the\r\ndoor of their state-room, and (as all ladies must) had something very\r\ninteresting to say at the last moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I am to be patient whether there is hope or not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said you would speak with papa. You forget how very kind he is to\r\neverybody in general, and how partial to you in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is most generous, almost too noble for this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often thought that, but as he is past fifty, I trust that a kind\r\nProvidence will spare him to us for many years yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he will be spared to you. If no good man could live, then\r\nthe gift of life would be a brand upon man\xe2\x80\x99s forehead. But a character\r\nas his, is truly very rare. He comes nearer to my standard of excellence\r\nthan any other man I ever saw, and I revere and love him for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall treasure those words in my heart, believe me. Let them remain\r\nthere forever,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, her voice vibrating with emotion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, and where is George?\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, looking around for her\r\nmissing husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe went to the captain\xe2\x80\x99s room to play cribbage about two minutes after\r\nyou left,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood chaperone he is; and what have you been talking about here like\r\ntwo little owls who know they musn\xe2\x80\x99t jump into the water because they\r\nare not ducks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne isn\xe2\x80\x99t, any way,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs my married experience is yet fresh and limited, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether\r\nit would be proper or not for us three to take a turn on deck and see\r\nwhether George is enjoying himself. What do you think, Mr. Darrell,\r\nwould a husband object to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say not. Why should he? To my way of thinking no husband of\r\nordinary good sense could object to his wife showing that interest in\r\nhim. Mr. Mechlin will not, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet Mr. Darrell take a look first,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mercedes.\r\n\r\nClarence arose to go, Elvira said: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly pass by, as if by accident, and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll go or not, according to circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Clarence had gone beyond hearing, Elvira said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks pale\r\nagain, have you made him unhappy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not made him happy, that is sure, and I am miserable, but you\r\nknow mamma\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, what can I do? Oh, what can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\nputting her arms around her sister and the hot tears she had been\r\nrepressing flowed fast. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so sorry I have to make him so unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say I feel sorry for him myself. I am not sure that mamma does\r\nhim justice,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira observed reflectively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to think that papa himself told him to follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and he is disappointed, but what can I do, dear, when mamma told\r\nme _not to encourage_ him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly am under no pledge, and papa\xe2\x80\x99s authority is entitled to as\r\nmuch respect as mamma\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said significantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, but you see mamma made me promise not to _encourage_\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes with sad insistence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and Rosa and Lota urged her to it. There is George now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go to my room; they will see by my red eyes that I cried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and bathe them. Drink some water, too, and come back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you some by way of an excuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did Mercedes run off?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will be back in a minute; she went to take a glass of water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! why did she not tell me to bring it to her?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence\r\nregretfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have thought of bringing it. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\nrather have a glass of wine or lemonade? and you, too, Mrs. Mechlin? I\r\nshall take it as a favor if you will accept. A glass of champagne with\r\nice I think would do very well for all of us; don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so Mr.\r\nMechlin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, champagne with ice would be very nice, provided the champagne be\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x9d George replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try any way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, going to order the wine. George and\r\nElvira watched him, and when out of hearing George said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know I like that young man very much. What is your mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobjection to him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis family, I believe, or rather his father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Darrell looks like a decent, honorable sort of a man to me.\r\nCertainly Clarence is very gentlemanly, and (what is equally to be\r\nconsidered) Mercedes likes him more than is good for her peace of mind\r\nif she is not to have him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor little sister, she is so unhappy, and, just think of it, papa\r\ntold Clarence to come, to follow Mercedes and propose to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did? That is just like him. Doubtless he thought of the times when\r\nhe would ride eighty miles to go and serenade Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa, and his\r\nsympathies all went to Darrell. It is a pity your mother doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel as\r\nkindly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what makes me feel more for Mercedes is, that she loves Clarence\r\ndearly, but in obedience to mamma\xe2\x80\x99s wishes she will not even give him\r\nany encouragement at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen _we_ must, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Only let us first be sure that she loves\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, as to that, if you had only seen her beautiful eyes filled with\r\nsuch sad tears because she cannot accept his love, you would have no\r\ndoubts as to her feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen my course is clear. I am a Christian gentleman and will not see\r\nsavage torture inflicted on my blue-eyed _hermanita_. I think I know how\r\nto fix it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Quien sabe_ just this minute, but it will be _something_, depend upon\r\nit. There he is now,\xe2\x80\x9d and Clarence came, followed by a waiter bringing\r\nthe champagne and ice. He looked disappointed at not finding Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat little sister of ours I fear has given us the slip. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo and fetch her bodily,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, rising to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; let me go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira. When George was left alone with Clarence\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear that Mercedes is very unhappy, she left when she saw us coming,\r\nElvira says, because she feared her eyes showed traces of tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence clenched his hands as if he would like to throttle all bad luck\r\nin general, and this one in particular, looked haggard, but remained\r\nsilent. George continued:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpanish girls are trained to strict filial obedience, and it is a good\r\nthing when not carried too far. Now, Mercedes made to her mother some\r\nvery foolish promise, and if her heart was to break into little pieces\r\nshe would not swerve\xe2\x80\x94not she\xe2\x80\x94though she be fully aware that her\r\nhappiness would be wrecked for ever, she would not disobey her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it alone her mother\xe2\x80\x99s wishes? In obeying her mother, does she\r\nnot follow her own inclination?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge laughed, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cShe must be a strange girl, indeed, if she\r\nweeps so bitterly and is so unhappy to follow her inclination.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if I only could think that! Are you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa wish to send her away? Only for the hope that she\r\nmight get over her love for you. Mercedes is not yet eighteen, and,\r\nbeing so young, her mother thought that by sending her away from you and\r\nyours, she might forget you. Only such hope as that could have prevailed\r\nupon Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa to part with her baby. Spanish mothers will never let a\r\ndaughter go out of the maternal sight until they are married; but for\r\nthe fear that Mercita\xe2\x80\x99s attachment to you might become incurable if not\r\neffaced early, the mother was ready to sacrifice her feelings. For it\r\nwas a terrible sacrifice, it was like pulling her heart strings to send\r\nher baby off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, how she must hate me then to have such strong objections to me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Clarence, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, she does not hate you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and George hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know she thinks I have done something wrong or dishonorable, but\r\nwhat that is, I have not the slightest idea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me for saying so, but I think it was a mistake not to tell\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94and Mercedes also\xe2\x80\x94that you bought the land you occupy. Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa\r\ncannot think it is honorable to take up land as your father did. She\r\ncannot understand how any law of Congress can authorize a man to take\r\nthe property of another against his will and without paying for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is perfectly right. I see the mistake now, and I regret it more\r\nthan words can tell. You knew why I asked Don Mariano not to mention\r\nthat I had paid him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Gabriel told me first, and he, too, thinks it is a mistake to let\r\nthe Alamar ladies have a wrong idea of you. He thinks you do an\r\ninjustice to yourself. We were talking about it when Don Mariano joined\r\nus, and he agreed with Gabriel and said that he would speak to you about\r\nit very soon. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t any of your family know about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Everett and mother do. She would not have come down if I had not\r\ntold her I paid for the land. But she and I thought that for the present\r\nwe had better say nothing about it to father, knowing how sensitive he\r\nis about his views of \xe2\x80\x98_Squatter rights_?\xe2\x80\x99 He has had so much trouble\r\nabout those same rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you will have to tell him soon\xe2\x80\x94I mean when the attorney\r\ngeneral dismisses the appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will that be, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as soon as the Supreme Court is in session. It would have been\r\ndone last fall had not the solicitor general interfered in the most\r\nabsurd and arbitrary manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard he had, and I heard the settlers rejoicing about it, but I\r\nnever knew how it happened\xe2\x80\x94I would like to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ladies and gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, coming, \xe2\x80\x9cif my eloquence and\r\npersuasive powers were not of the unprecedented quality they really are,\r\nI would never have been able to persuade the se\xc3\xb1orita to come. Would you\r\nbelieve it? she was actually in bed for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence exclaimed, regretfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I told her that if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t come, you would take the champagne\r\nto her room, and this so frightened her, that she began to dress herself\r\nimmediately, but the poor little thing trembles as if she had the ague.\r\nI gave her a cashmere wrapper and soft shawl to wrap up and not take\r\ncold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and tell her we have good news for her,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll think you are jesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if you tell her that we know what it is that Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa has\r\nagainst Darrell, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it all right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t deceive the poor little thing when she seems as if all her\r\nstrength is already gone from her,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we are not deceiving her,\xe2\x80\x9d George insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! here she comes,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said, and Mercedes slowly approached\r\nthem. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, sweet Baby, these gentlemen say they have some awful nice\r\nnews for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNews that the wine is good, I suppose, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like wine,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the wine,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, rising for Mercedes to take his\r\nplace. \xe2\x80\x9cSit down here between Darrell and myself and you shall hear all\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes asked, looking from one to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, little sister, for they haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarrell, you fill the glasses now while I tell these se\xc3\xb1oritas what\r\nsort of a black sheep Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa thinks you are, and so thinking,\r\nobjects to you.\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence proceeded to put ice into the glasses, while\r\nGeorge continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe objection is, that she believes the Darrells are\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_squatters_,\xe2\x80\x99 like all the others at the rancho, whereas Clarence\r\nbought their land from Don Mariano and paid for it even before they\r\nbuilt their house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I am so glad to hear that!\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira exclaimed with a sigh of relief.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why don\xe2\x80\x99t papa tell it to mamma? It is an injustice to the Darrells\r\nto let her ignore it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my fault, Mrs. Mechlin,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said; \xe2\x80\x9cmy father holds the\r\naccepted but very erroneous popular opinions about \xe2\x80\x98_squatter rights_,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand I, to avoid painful discussions with him, requested Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar not\r\nto say, for the present, that I had paid for the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, little sister, how, after all, you have not been loving a\r\nsquatter? What a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, putting his arm around Mercedes,\r\nwho buried her face in the lappels of his coat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t half so\r\nromantic to love a plain gentleman as to love a brigand, or, at least, a\r\nsquatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa\xe2\x80\x99s objection to me is perfectly proper and correct. I would\r\nnot let a daughter of mine marry a squatter no more than to marry a\r\ntramp. I shall, of course, request Don Mariano to put me right in her\r\nestimation, and tell her I do not feel authorized by Congress to steal\r\nland, though my father and many other honest men hold different opinions\r\nabout it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! Do you hear that? Let us have a bumper, and drown the squatter\r\nin champagne! Exit tramp! Enter gentleman! Here is to Baby\xe2\x80\x99s health,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid George.\r\n\r\nAll emptied their glasses, except Mercedes, whose hand shook so\r\nviolently that she spilled more wine than she drank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lose your courage now,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe pussy is regretting she lost her squatter. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so,\r\npussy? You have not said one word. Are you regretting that, after all,\r\nyou cannot sacrifice to love your patrician pride by marrying a\r\nland-shark, thus proving you are a heroine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a silly boy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I think our romance is spoiled. It would have been so fine\xe2\x80\x94like\r\na dime novel\xe2\x80\x94to have carried you off bodily by order of infuriated,\r\ncruel parents, and on arriving at New York marry you, at the point of a\r\nloaded revolver, to a bald-headed, millionaire! Your midnight shrieks\r\nwould have made the blood of the passers-by curdle! Then Clarence would\r\nhave rushed in and stabbed the millionaire, and you, falling across his\r\nprostrate body, said: \xe2\x80\x98Tramp or not, I am thine!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, George, stop your nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhereas now,\xe2\x80\x9d George went on, \xe2\x80\x9cthe unpoetical fact comes out that\r\nDarrell is a decent sort of a fellow, and there is no reason why a\r\nproper girl shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have him for her husband; and our romance is\r\nstripped of its thrilling features, as the hero will not steal, even\r\nwhen Congress tells him to. And that is the _d\xc3\xa9nouement_, with the\r\naddition only that I am hungry. What have you got to eat in those two\r\nlittle baskets that Tano brought on board, and which smell so nice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes, I had forgotten. Mamma put up a nice lunch, thinking we might\r\nwant it if we felt sick, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to the table. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and\r\nbring it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, setting down her glass, and rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, \xe2\x80\x9cas I am the hungry one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring both baskets. Let us see what they have. Ah, I was forgetting, I\r\nhave the three little silver plates in my satchel; we must have those,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Elvira, following her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you forgive my stupidity? See what a world of anxious thoughts we\r\nwould have avoided by explaining to Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClarence to Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was unfortunate. But you will return soon and ask papa to tell\r\nher all, will you not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I will, by the next steamer; and will have better heart to await\r\nyour return. My precious angel, don\xe2\x80\x99t ever forget how devotedly I\r\nidolize you! Will you let me send you a ring, if your mother allows me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you _bring_ it yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mercedes, my beloved! how happy you make me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, groping in the dark; \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are the magic\r\nbaskets? I don\xe2\x80\x99t smell them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, that is why I came to find them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here! if you follow a fellow like that, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get kissed,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, taking his wife in his arms, and covering her face with kisses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, George, some one might pass who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you are my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, desisting. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the fact of the matter is, that I\r\nwant to kiss you all the time, you are so pretty and such a sweet\r\ndarling. Give me the basket, and let your hungry husband go before he\r\neats you up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are. I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry the plates and knives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTano said something about boned turkey, _a la espanola_, stuffed with\r\nmashed almonds and \xe2\x80\x98_ajonjoli_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said George, setting the baskets on a\r\nchair before Clarence; \xe2\x80\x9cand something about a \xe2\x80\x98_tortita de aceituna_,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwith sweet marjoram, and I think we got them, to judge by their\r\nfragrance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I go and order more wine?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is plenty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow strange it is that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt this wine at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cone-half glass only will make my face unpleasantly warm always, for\r\nthat reason I dislike wines; but see, I drank this whole glassful, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t feel it any more than if it was water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you feel warmer? You were shivering when you came from your\r\nroom,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I feel better,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow eat a little and you will sleep better. Take one of these\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_empanaditas de pollo_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, offering one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me one,\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know them by experience, and the trouble\r\nabout them is that you can never have enough, though you feel you have\r\neaten too many. Try them, Darrell, and when you have filled our glasses\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll satisfy your curiosity, telling you why the Solicitor General would\r\nnot dismiss the appeal of the squatters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I want to know all about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, filling the\r\nglasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\xe2\x80\x94_Why the Appeal was Not Dismissed._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time when this moonlit picnic of four took place on the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeck, as it glided northward over the glassy surface of the immense\r\nPacific, the people of California had not yet heard about the disclosure\r\nof the famous _Colton suit_. This suit was hidden in the mists of a\r\ndistant future, and therefore the famous \xe2\x80\x9c_Huntington Letters_\xe2\x80\x9d had not\r\ncome forth to educate the American mind in the fascinating, meandering,\r\nshady ways of \xe2\x80\x9c_convincing_\xe2\x80\x9d or of \xe2\x80\x9c_bribery and corruption_,\xe2\x80\x9d as the\r\nnewspapers and committee reports have harshly stigmatized Mr.\r\nHuntington\xe2\x80\x99s diplomacy(!) At that time, 1872, people yet spoke of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_bribery_\xe2\x80\x9d with a degree of shamefacedness and timidity. It was\r\nreserved for Mr. Huntington to familiarize the American people with the\r\nfact that an American gentleman could go to Washington with the avowed\r\npurpose of influencing legislation by \xe2\x80\x9c_convincing_\xe2\x80\x9d people with money\r\nor other inducements, and yet no one lose caste, or lose his high social\r\nor public position, but on the contrary, the _convinced and the\r\nconvincer_ be treated with the most distinguished consideration. So\r\nafter drinking half of his second glass, George said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the stories about Washington being such a corrupt\r\nplace, where people get everything by bribing. That is a shameful\r\nslander. I went there about that dismissal of the Squatters\xe2\x80\x99 Appeal, and\r\nwas treated like a gentleman, even by the Solicitor General, who was\r\noutrageously unjust to us. After my uncle had sent to the Attorney\r\nGeneral Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s letter explaining the case and stating how the\r\ntranscript had been in Washington two years, I went as Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nattorney to look after the case. I saw the Attorney General immediately,\r\nand he told me to return at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock next morning. I did so, and was\r\nshown in at once. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I looked at the case again last evening, and don\xe2\x80\x99t see where those\r\nsettlers can find a hook on which to hang their appeal. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t any.\r\nIt is very singular that this case has not been dismissed before by my\r\npredecessor. So I was just telling the Solicitor General, as you\r\nentered, to have it dismissed this morning. I have explained my opinion\r\nto him. He is going now to the Supreme Court and can make the motion and\r\ntell the clerk to enter the dismissal to-day. The United States have no\r\ncase against Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar, his title is perfectly good,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\nlooking at the Solicitor, who stood by silent and motionless. \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\nonly this one case to attend to this morning, besides the one I want\r\ncontinued until I return. The others, you understand, I leave you to\r\nmanage as you think proper, and at such times as you think best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thanked the Attorney General, and as I took my leave I said I did not\r\nknow he was going away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I am going this evening to Oregon to see my\r\nconstituents, but my absence will not affect your case, the Solicitor\r\nGeneral takes my place during my absence, and he has only to say before\r\nthe Supreme Court that I enter a dismissal, and that ends the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I went out I said to the Solicitor, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose then this business is\r\nfinished now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Such is the supposition,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and we went out together. I had a\r\ngreat mind to follow him to the Supreme Court and see what he was going\r\nto do, but I thought he might not like being watched. Well, sir, would\r\nyou believe it? That man went to the Supreme Court and never said _boo_\r\nabout our dismissal. Next morning I went to ask him if the dismissal was\r\nentered. He sent word he was engaged,\xe2\x80\x94to call again. I called in the\r\nafternoon, and he had left the office. Next morning I called again, and\r\nhe of course was engaged. I went to the clerk of the Supreme Court, and\r\ngiving him the number of the case, asked if it had been dismissed. He\r\nsaid no, that the Solicitor General had been at the Supreme Court every\r\nday, but had entered no dismissal. I telegraphed to Uncle Lawrence to\r\ncome, and as soon as he arrived we went to see the President about it. I\r\nlaid the whole case before him. I told him how the squatters were\r\ndestroying Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s cattle, and how by a law of the California\r\nlegislature, any one could plant grain field without fencing, and take\r\nup cattle that went to those fields, no matter whether there was any\r\ntitle to the land or whether the field was no larger than one acre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But the law does not open to settlers private property, private\r\nlands?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes it does, because land is not considered _private property_ until\r\nthe title to it is confirmed and patented. As the proceedings to obtain\r\na patent might consume years, almost a life time, the result is that the\r\nnative Californians (of Spanish descent) who were the land owners when\r\nwe took California, are virtually despoiled of their lands and their\r\ncattle and horses. Congress virtually took away their lands by putting\r\nthem in litigation. And the California legislature takes away their\r\ncattle, decreeing that settlers need not fence their crops, but put in a\r\n_corral_ the cattle that will surely come to graze in their fields. As\r\nthe cattle don\xe2\x80\x99t know the law, they eat the crops and get killed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But that is very hard on those land owners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Certainly. They are being impoverished with frightful rapidity. In a\r\nfew years the majority of them will have been totally ruined, socially\r\nobliterated. I doubt if a dozen families will escape ruin. There seems\r\nto be a settled purpose with our law-givers to drive the natives to\r\npoverty, and crowd them out of existence. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t turn them all into\r\nhardened and most desperate criminals, it will be because they are among\r\nthe most incorruptible of the human race. But there is no denying that\r\nour laws are doing all that can be done to drive them into squalid\r\nhovels, and thence into the penitentiaries or the poor houses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98This is certainly very sad,\xe2\x80\x99 said the President, with genuine\r\nsympathy, adding after a short pause:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Wait for me here. I\xe2\x80\x99ll run across the street to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask the Solicitor what it all means in this Alamar\r\ncase,\xe2\x80\x99 so saying he put on his hat and went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That is what endears General Grant to all his friends,\xe2\x80\x99 said my uncle;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the idea of his going personally to see the Solicitor, he the\r\nPresident, and only because he wishes to do a kindness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I wish he had sent for the proud Solicitor to come here. This visit of\r\nthe President will make him more over-bearing,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. \xe2\x80\x98I am disgusted\r\nat his most arbitrary conduct.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Wait,\xe2\x80\x99 said my uncle, \xe2\x80\x98let us hear\r\nfirst what he has to say to the President.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a short time the President returned. He said: \xe2\x80\x98Well, gentlemen, I\r\ncannot make out why the Solicitor did not dismiss the case, as he was\r\nordered. He says he found that the Attorney General had not looked into\r\nthe record carefully, and so he did not think the case should be\r\ndismissed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But how could he have found out that the Attorney General had not\r\nlooked into the case carefully only by riding from the office to the\r\nSupreme Court? He must have _disobeyed the instructions of the Attorney\r\nGeneral first_, and then to justify his disobedience, trumps up the\r\npretext that the case had not been examined,\xe2\x80\x99 said uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Attorney General did not tell him to look into the case and give\r\nhis opinion. He was told that the case _had been examined_; that the\r\npleadings and allegations were trivial; that the United States had _no\r\ncase_, and the matter should be dismissed,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It is clear, that without authority he took upon himself to review and\r\nreverse the decision of the Attorney General,\xe2\x80\x99 said my uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand his motive or object,\xe2\x80\x99 the President said. \xe2\x80\x98But I\r\ntold him I presumed he could state his opinion in writing, and he said\r\nhe would. Perhaps he will give a better reason for his action than he\r\ndid verbally.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 uncle said, \xe2\x80\x98he will give no better reason, as he has none\r\nto give. He has some spite against the Attorney General, and is laying\r\nin wait to catch something to hurt him. Fortunately, he can\xe2\x80\x99t use this\r\ncase for any such purpose, for it is a very clear one, and the hands of\r\nthe Attorney General are very clean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Of course they are,\xe2\x80\x99 the President said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And now, sir, what do you advise us to do?\xe2\x80\x99 asked uncle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe President smiled, mused a little, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My advice would be to wait until the Attorney General returns from\r\nOregon. I know it is a hardship for the rightful owner of the land to\r\nwait so long, but the question is, would it not be longer if the\r\nSolicitor finds other reasons to take this case into his own hands. Now\r\nhe has promised me to let the matter rest until the Attorney General\r\ncomes back.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 my uncle said, \xe2\x80\x98I think what you advise is the best thing to do.\r\nEvidently the Solicitor is beating the bush to start some game, and will\r\nbe satisfied with a \xe2\x80\x98mare\xe2\x80\x99s nest,\xe2\x80\x99 if he can only entangle the Attorney\r\nGeneral in it. But this is a very paltry and picayunish business for a\r\nSolicitor General, Mr. President, and it is silly, too, because he has\r\nshown his hand to little purpose. He has plainly demonstrated how\r\nanxious he is to find something against the Attorney General, but that\r\nsomething he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got yet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe President laughed, and said: \xe2\x80\x98You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be so hard on the\r\nSolicitor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was decided that my uncle would return to New York by the four\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock train that afternoon, and I would remain to receive the opinion\r\nin writing which the Solicitor had promised the President he would give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not have to wait until next day for that profound opinion. As I\r\nwas going to dinner at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, a messenger handed me a closed\r\nofficial envelope which felt quite heavy. But that was all the weight\r\nthe thing possessed, for it was the lightest, most vapory composition\r\nthat a grown-up man, long past boyhood, could evolve from a mature\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt made me angry to read it. \xe2\x80\x98The man is evidently not a fool, but\r\nthinks we are,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to myself, and made up my mind I would go next\r\nmorning and tell him to his face what I thought of his conduct and his\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPromptly at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock next morning I presented myself at the Attorney\r\nGeneral\xe2\x80\x99s office, and was immediately ushered before the august presence\r\nof the great Solicitor, the mighty hunter of \xe2\x80\x98mare\xe2\x80\x99s nests.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nevidently thought I had come to thank him for his vapory effusion, for\r\nhe received me quite smilingly, and without a trace of that hauteur\r\nwhich he had at first meant should be so crushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaking the chair he so graciously offered me, I said: \xe2\x80\x98Sir, without\r\nmeaning any disrespect to the Solicitor General of the United States, I\r\nwould like to inquire what is the meaning of the document I had the\r\nhonor to receive from you yesterday?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe colored up, but still smiling, answered: \xe2\x80\x98Did you not understand it?\r\nI thought I wrote in very plain English.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The English was plain enough, but I failed to catch your idea. Will\r\nyou permit me to make a few enquiries?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Certainly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You remember I was present when the Attorney General told you that he\r\nhad examined the transcript carefully, and not finding that the\r\ngovernment has any case at all, ordered you to dismiss it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe bowed, but did not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI continued: \xe2\x80\x98The Attorney General did not request you or authorize you\r\nto review his opinion. He merely said you were to dismiss the appeal,\r\nand have the clerk of the court enter in the record the order of\r\ndismissal that same morning. Had you obeyed the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s\r\norder, you could not have had time to review his opinion, and find that\r\nit was incorrect. Has the Solicitor General the right, and is it\r\nincumbent upon him, to correct the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s acts and\r\nopinions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You evidently do not understand our relative positions, and I have not\r\nthe time to instruct you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Whose positions do you mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ours\xe2\x80\x94mine and the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who is the head of the department\xe2\x80\x94the Attorney General or the\r\nSolicitor?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Attorney General.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then he was your chief\xe2\x80\x94your superior\xe2\x80\x94when he gave the order to make\r\nthe dismissal?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98But I was not his clerk. You do not know how far it was discretionary\r\nwith me to execute the order that day or not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah, I see. The chief might issue an order, but the subaltern might\r\nonly execute it if he deems it proper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I am not a subaltern\xe2\x80\x94I have as much authority\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, in the absence of the Attorney General.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Always\xe2\x80\x94when absent or present\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then the department has two heads. That is, I suppose, what confused\r\nthings in my mind. The matter then is to rest as it now is until the\r\nAttorney General returns?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I shall not remand the case, as I might have done; it will wait.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took my leave then, having seen that he understood I saw through the\r\ncontemptible impertinence of his conduct. That is all the satisfaction I\r\ncould have then, but next winter, as soon as the Supreme Court convenes,\r\nthe matter will be settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will the squatters have to go then?\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot immediately, unless they were to be guided by honorable motives.\r\nThe rancho will be surveyed first, and then the patent issued after the\r\nsurvey is approved by the Surveyor General,\xe2\x80\x9d George replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! The endless red tape,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor papa, he has so much trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cIn another year\r\nall the cattle will have been killed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the squatters will be more murderous, when they learn that their\r\nappeal is dismissed,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I was thinking what will be the best to do to meet the emergency.\r\nI shall speak about that to Don Mariano on my return,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you help him all you can,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost undoubtedly. I will be able to do much more if I can persuade my\r\nfather to take a correct view of the matter. But he might not, for as he\r\nhas had so much trouble sustaining the rights of squatters, he has got\r\nto feel as if he were the champion of a misunderstood cause and much\r\nmaligned people,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, smiling sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, if Mr. Darrell is to be unfriendly, papa will have much more\r\ntrouble to manage the others,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow singular that a man as bright and honorable as he is, can find any\r\nreason to justify \xe2\x80\x98_squatterism_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he began by being persuaded to take a claim in the Suscol\r\nrancho, honestly thinking it was government land. Afterwards the grant\r\nwas confirmed, I think, but then he already felt compelled to maintain\r\nhis position to justify his action, and so he began by a mistake which\r\nhis pride will not let him acknowledge. I was a little child then, but I\r\nknow he has had a great deal of trouble. For the last ten years we have\r\nbeen leasing land, but he had been wishing to have a farm of his own, so\r\nas not to be putting his labor and time and money to improve some one\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s land. Thus he was induced to come south on the representations\r\nthat there was plenty of vacant government land, and that the Texas\r\nPacific railroad would soon be built and southern California be\r\nprosperous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, anxious to extenuate his father\xe2\x80\x99s errors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall telegraph to Don Mariano when the appeal is dismissed, so you\r\ncan prepare the ground the best way you can,\xe2\x80\x9d said George. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now\r\nyoung ladies it is near midnight, and is time for well regulated\r\nchildren to be asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe moon is so lovely I could sit here for hours, watching its flashes\r\non the water,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo could I,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I could not allow it, and let you both run the risk of being\r\nconsidered moon struck,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\xe2\x80\x94_At San Francisco._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was quite high above the horizon when George joined Clarence on\r\ndeck; and both began to promenade and talk while waiting for the ladies\r\nto come, that the four might go to breakfast together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy private opinion is that these young ladies are going to oversleep\r\nthemselves,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, as they passed the door of his room, after\r\npromenading for half an hour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo they are not,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said, coming out as fresh and beautiful as a\r\n_rosa de castilla_. \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, Mr. Darrell, I hope you are well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Clarence, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I never felt better. I am\r\ndelighted to see you so bright and blooming; you are evidently an\r\nexcellent sailor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI really enjoy it; but where is the Se\xc3\xb1orita\r\nMercita; is she not yet up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not. She has not come from her room,\xe2\x80\x9d was Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to peep through her window,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira. She did so by\r\nturning the slats and pushing aside the curtain just a little. She then\r\nmotioned to George to come and look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy jove, Darrell, you ought to see this picture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush! you will awake her by speaking so loud,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said, still\r\nlooking at her sister.\r\n\r\nA tiny sunbeam played over Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 forehead, making the little curls\r\nover it look like golden threads. Her head was thrown back a little and\r\nturned towards the window, displaying her white throat, partially\r\ncovered by the lace frills of her night dress. Her left arm rested\r\ngracefully over her head, with the sleeve pushed off displaying part of\r\nthe forearm and the perfect curve of her delicate wrist. The right hand\r\nrested over the coverlet, and it looked like a child\xe2\x80\x99s hand, so dimpled\r\nand white and soft. It was a perfect picture of a \xe2\x80\x9csleeping beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t she look like a baby? My own sweet sister; I am so glad she is\r\nsleeping so sweetly. She has slept very poorly for months,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered\r\nElvira. \xe2\x80\x9cCome away, we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t talk near her window, she must have all\r\nthe sleep she wants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, she pulled back the curtain, shut down the window slats, and\r\nall walked noiselessly away.\r\n\r\nAs they went down to breakfast, Elvira said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope no one will come smoking some nasty cigar by her window,\r\npoisoning the air and making her miserable, for she cannot bear tobacco\r\nsmoke when the boat is in motion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought she was not subject to sea-sickness,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all, as long as there are no tobacco fumes near, but it\r\nseems that tobacco smoke, combined with the rocking of the sea, make her\r\ndeathly sick, whereas the tobacco alone or the rocking by itself, will\r\nnot affect her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that well, for I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to smoke while sailing either,\r\nif there is much motion, and I think no one ought to be allowed to smoke\r\non deck where ladies are,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so too. We have too many rights, and more than our share of\r\nprivileges,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait until we have woman suffrage. We will make things uncomfortable\r\nfor inebriates and tobacco smokers,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said, laughing.\r\n\r\nTheir pleasant voyage came to its end, as all things must in this\r\nfleeting life, and the names of Mr. George Mechlin and party, from San\r\nDiego, were duly entered in the hotel register.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI put your name down, Darrell, for we want you with us while in the\r\ncity,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you sincerely; that is exactly what I wished.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will be ready for dinner at six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be on hand promptly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence was anxious to see his broker and afraid he would leave the\r\noffice before he got there, but it was more imperative yet to visit his\r\ntailor. He did so, and though in haste, selected with care the cut and\r\nstyle and color which he knew was most becoming. He left a list of all\r\nthe articles of clothing he desired to be sent to his hotel by five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then directed his driver to take him to his broker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust in time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hubert Haverly, coming forward to meet him. \xe2\x80\x9cAs\r\nsoon as the steamer was signaled at the gate, I sent to look for our\r\nArizona men. They are now at the back office waiting for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me something about the matter, to guide me. And tell me too, how\r\npoor or how rich I am, before I make any bargain to purchase mines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, on the whole, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you rich. I bought the farm as\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94or rather as Everett\xe2\x80\x94telegraphed. I paid\xe2\x80\x94well, how much do you think\r\nI paid for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundred and forty thousand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHubert shook his head, saying \xe2\x80\x9cTry again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundred and twenty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNinety thousand only, lucky fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You said he asked a hundred and fifty thousand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and you\xe2\x80\x94or Everett\xe2\x80\x94telegraphed to pay the money, but you see the\r\npoor fellow lost heavily in stocks that day, and as the bank was going\r\nto foreclose on the farm for a loan of forty thousand, he thought the\r\nbest thing he could do was to sell out quick. He came to see me and said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you think Clarence will buy for one hundred and twenty thousand?\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ntold him I had telegraphed to you and probably you would come up. He\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x98If you pay me ninety thousand cash down _to-day_, Clarence can\r\nhave the farm for that price.\xe2\x80\x99 I told him to let me have the refusal for\r\nyou, for that price, until the next morning. I got your telegram in the\r\nevening. Next morning he came looking very dejected, and asked if I had\r\nheard from you. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He waited, but as I said no more, he\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98I hope Clarence is not going to pinch me hard. The farm is worth\r\ntwo hundred thousand, but as the Darrells made all the improvements on\r\nit, I am willing he should have it cheaper than any one else. How much\r\ndoes he offer?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98He left it to me to make the best bargain I can. I will\r\nlet you have the ninety thousand, of course.\xe2\x80\x99 You never saw a man so\r\nrelieved. He lifted his head and said, \xe2\x80\x98I will pay all my debts and have\r\nthirty thousand clear, anyway, to make a beginning,\xe2\x80\x99 and so the papers\r\nwere drawn up and the farm is yours. I congratulate you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, squeezing Hubert\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now about the\r\nbalance on hand and the Arizona mines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have about one hundred thousand dollars. If you sell all your\r\nstocks, you could have two hundred thousand,\xe2\x80\x9d Hubert replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides the interest on the bonds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I never figure on that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about the Arizona mines?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the men say they are yet \xe2\x80\x98_a prospect_,\xe2\x80\x99 but a very good one.\r\nTheir proposition is that you pay them five hundred dollars down if you\r\naccept their proposal. Then you are to send an expert to examine the\r\nmines. If on his report you conclude to buy them at once, you can have\r\nthem for ten thousand dollars. If you prefer to bond them to prospect\r\nfurther before buying, then you can have six months to prospect; but\r\nthen you must pay two thousand down, and at the end of the six months\r\nyou must pay fifty thousand dollars if you want both mines, or twenty\r\nthousand if you only take one. The shaft they have sunk is the dividing\r\nline between the two mines.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetween the two prospects,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is more proper, the shaft is only about one hundred feet\r\ndeep. But you had better talk to them. They brought rock similar to that\r\nwhich they sent me last month.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRather rough looking men were the three waiting, but all had good faces.\r\nAfter exchanging salutations with them, Clarence asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you had any assays made?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the oldest of the three handing to him three slips of\r\npaper. \xe2\x80\x9cHere are three certificates from assayers recommended to us as\r\nthe best in San Francisco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! One hundred silver and one hundred and fifty gold? And two\r\nhundred, and three hundred and fifty? But that is enormous for surface\r\nrock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe miners laughed. The oldest said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the ledge is so wide that it almost takes the half of the hill. We\r\ntook two claims and put our prospect shaft in the middle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you make your locations in good legal form?\xe2\x80\x9d was the next question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes sir, we have our papers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the spokesman, handing to Clarence\r\nsome papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see you are four partners, where is the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is at the mine, working at the shaft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have just come, an hour ago. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how soon I will find an expert, but I think I will do so between\r\nnow and to-morrow by mid-day. I will consult with him and see how soon\r\nhe can go to look at your mines. Meantime I\xe2\x80\x99ll have some of the rock\r\nassayed. From what depth was the rock assayed taken?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom fifty, seventy and ninety feet. We have some few pieces from the\r\nlast we took the day we left, at a depth of one hundred feet.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nsaying, he handed to Clarence other pieces of rock which looked much\r\nricher, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the ore we have not had assayed yet. My opinion\r\nis that the rock hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that Clarence would meet them at eleven next morning and\r\nnotify them if he had found an expert. When they had left the room\r\nClarence asked Hubert where his brother Fred was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is here, he came yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you did not mention that fact to me, when you know I want a good,\r\nreliable expert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not, because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t urge his services upon any one\xe2\x80\x94even\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94and then I think he might be already engaged to go to examine some\r\nmines in Nevada, as parties have been looking for him for that purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t be so proud as to deprive me of the services of so good a\r\nman, but tell him to come to my hotel at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him, but he will not be here until five o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\nShall I tell him to call on you after dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, at half-past seven exactly, to send his card to me to any place I\r\nmay be at the hotel. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to have two or three assays more of\r\nthis rock. Remember, I shall be looking for Fred at half-past seven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll remember. He will be there promptly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very evident that the \xe2\x80\x9cparty from San Diego\xe2\x80\x9d made an impression\r\nand quite a stir among the guests of the hotel, who were at dinner when\r\nthey entered the dining-room. Preceded by the head waiter, they had to\r\ncross the entire length of the room, for the seats assigned to them were\r\nat the furthest corner from the door. Everybody turned to look, to see\r\nwhat everybody else was looking at, and all acknowledged that they had\r\nnever seen handsomer or more graceful people than those two couples.\r\nExclamations of surprise were uttered in suppressed tones, and\r\nunqualified praises were whispered everywhere. The head waiter was\r\ncalled here and there to say who these four people were, so very\r\nhandsome and _distingu\xc3\xa9_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are from Southern California, on their way east. Mr. George\r\nMechlin and bride, her sister, and their friend Mr. Darrell, travelling\r\nwith them,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer that the steward had to give twenty times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the bride, the blonde or the brunette?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brunette.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter dinner several young gentlemen remained in the corridors to see\r\nthem pass, and some four eastern tourists who were dining at the next\r\ntable, made a pretext of drinking more wine, to remain looking at the\r\nsouthern beauties. One of them especially looked at Mercedes so\r\npersistently that Clarence began to feel angry, and when they arose from\r\nthe table he looked at the admirer with a bold stare of defiant\r\nreproval. But that in no way checked the admiration of the New Yorker,\r\nand he followed as near to Mercedes as he could, and when he saw her\r\ndisappear into her parlor, he looked at the number on the door and went\r\nstraight to the office to make all the enquiries he could concerning\r\nthose two beautiful ladies. The clerk gave all the information he could,\r\nand added laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had to answer those questions a dozen times already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nImmediately after dinner a waiter came from the office and handed to\r\nClarence a card, with \xe2\x80\x9cFred Haverly\xe2\x80\x9d written on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay to the gentleman I shall be down immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said to the\r\nservant; and then to George, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the expert I want to send to\r\nArizona. It is lucky for me to find him in town.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go down with you,\xe2\x80\x9d George said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the clerks promised to get\r\nme a box at the opera, or if that can\xe2\x80\x99t be had, to get the four best\r\nseats he could find disengaged. Do you think you will have finished with\r\nyour expert in half an hour? I want the girls to see the opera bouffe;\r\nthey have never seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be with you in fifteen minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nGeorge was talking with the clerk about the seats at the opera, when he\r\nfelt a hand laid softly on his shoulder. Looking back, he saw his\r\nfriend, Charles Gunther, of New York, standing by him, and behind him\r\nthe four gentlemen who had dined at the next table. After shaking hands\r\nmost cordially, and congratulating him on being a married man, Gunther\r\npresented to George his four friends, and his brother Robert, who now\r\ncame in; then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard you say you wanted a box at the opera, and that there are\r\nladies with you. Permit me to offer you our box, we can take seats\r\nanywhere else. I shall be glad if you will accept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are no seats that you can have that I would offer you in\r\nexchange,\xe2\x80\x9d was George\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose I got for you are good seats for gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d the clerk suggested,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I think you can get two more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGunther was so urgent that George, only by being very rude, could have\r\ndeclined making the exchange. There was nothing else to do but accept,\r\norder a carriage for eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then go up stairs to tell the\r\nladies that they were to get ready for the opera.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opera! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell us before?\xe2\x80\x9d was Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was not sure I could get seats,\xe2\x80\x9d was George\xe2\x80\x99s reply; and he\r\nthen explained how he obtained their box by casually meeting Gunther,\r\nadding: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the by, he introduced me to his brother Robert and those\r\nfour admirers of yours, Mercedes, who dined at the next table. They are\r\nall of the same party. The young fellow of the little saffron whiskers,\r\nwho stared at you so persistently, making Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s ears red, is a Mr.\r\nSelden, of New York; he and Robert Gunther have been in Europe several\r\nyears. His father I know is a millionaire, and he is the only son. So he\r\nconsiders himself a good catch, I suppose, Se\xc3\xb1orita Mercedes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBah!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Mercedes; \xe2\x80\x9cwho cares!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe ready with your hats and cloaks on at five minutes to eight.\r\nClarence and I will come for you. I am going to look for him now, and\r\nsee Gunther for a few moments,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, leaving the two sisters to\r\ngo to their bedrooms to delve for their opera cloaks and white hats in\r\nthe deep recesses of their Saratoga trunks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a lucky thing for me that Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s aunt sent this pretty cloak\r\nand bonnet to her. Poor Lizzie! I am to _splurge_ in her fine Parisian\r\nthings, while she remains at the _rancho_, buried alive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is perfectly willing to have that sort of burial as long as she has\r\nGabriel near her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Lawrence Mechlin had sent to Elvira and Lizzie their wedding\r\ntrousseau, which she ordered from Paris. To do this was a pleasure to\r\nMrs. Mechlin, which she could well afford, being rich, and which she\r\ndelighted in, being devoted to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s children.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was filled to its utmost capacity when our four _San\r\nDieguinos_ arrived and occupied their proscenium box, which was on the\r\nleft of the auditorium, very roomy and elegantly furnished. Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseat faced the stage, and Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 faced the audience, so that the\r\nperfect contour of her features was clearly seen when she looked at the\r\nactors. Between the sisters sat their cavaliers. The curtain rose as\r\nthey took their seats, so that not one of them gave a thought to the\r\naudience, until the curtain fell on the first act.\r\n\r\nThen they all looked at the house which was filled with a brilliant\r\naudience. Immediately in front, in the first row of orchestra chairs,\r\nwere Mr. Gunther and the party of New Yorkers. They were all looking at\r\ntheir box. Mercedes blushed when she met the steady gaze of Mr. Selden,\r\nand his face reproduced the blush, while his heart beat with wild throbs\r\nof delight. Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s face also flushed, and then turned pale. He had\r\nseen the two blush, and a cold feeling of undefinable fear and\r\nsavageness seized him\xe2\x80\x94a desire to go and choke Mr. Selden where he\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94right there in his orchestra chair.\r\n\r\nGeorge by this time was exchanging bows with the New Yorkers. They spoke\r\namong themselves, and soon after all arose and left their seats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Gunther is bringing his brother and friends to present them to\r\nyou, ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing your friends, we shall be pleased to see them,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope those gentlemen will cease to stare when they are acquainted.\r\nThat young man of the red whiskers made me blush by looking at me so\r\nsteadily. I hope that that is not the custom of New Yorkers,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid it is. You had better try to get used to it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d George replied.\r\n\r\nMr. Gunther now presented himself at the door, followed by his brother\r\nand the four others, already well known by sight, the ceremony of\r\nintroduction being performed by George, with the ease and grace of one\r\nused to those society duties. All took seats, there being room enough\r\nfor a dozen people in the spacious box.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Clarence had left their seats to receive the guests, so very\r\nnaturally Mr. Selden slipped by and sat next to Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\xe2\x80\x94_Of Miscellaneous Incidents._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of the opera\xe2\x80\x94are you enjoying it much?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nSelden, by way of opening conversation, having turned his chair to face\r\nMercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am enjoying the novelty of the thing, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I shall\r\nthink of the opera. I suppose I shall like it better when I understand\r\nit. Thus far it is to me only a very puzzling maze of hastily uttered\r\nFrench, imperfectly heard and mixed with music, all of which is rather\r\nunintelligible to me, so unprepared to judge of it as I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMercedes, smiling, watching to see the effect that her candid avowal of\r\nignorance would have upon such a \xe2\x80\x9c_muscadin_\xe2\x80\x9d and well traveled young\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! you never saw the opera before to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the French opera. I was at two matinees of the Italian opera about\r\nfive years ago, when I left my San Francisco school. Mamma thought I was\r\ntoo young to go out at night, and since then I have been living at the\r\n_rancho_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes; Mr. Mechlin said you had not been in San Francisco since you\r\nwere twelve months old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve months?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA laugh immediately behind him, made Mr. Selden turn quickly around. He\r\nmet the eyes of Mr. Robert Gunther, who had taken the chair next to him,\r\nand made no secret of being amused at Mr. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you laughing at?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Selden asked, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Mr. Gunther thinks that girls must grow very quickly in\r\nCalifornia if I was twelve months old five years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Selden could not escape now the raillery of his friends. Each one\r\nhad something to say on the subject of Mr. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s ideas of the wonders\r\nof California, until the bell rung for the curtain to rise for the\r\nsecond act.\r\n\r\nThey all arose to go. George said: \xe2\x80\x9cWill not some of you remain? there\r\nis room for two or three more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I am not going to crowd you, I shall accept your kind invitation and\r\nhide about here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robert Gunther, taking a chair behind Elvira.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBob Gunther is always such a good boy that I always like to follow his\r\nexample; so, with your kind permission, Mr. Darrell, I shall sit here\r\nbehind you. Keep your chair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Selden, refusing to change seats\r\nwith Clarence.\r\n\r\nBut Mercedes saw that this arrangement was not as satisfactory as might\r\nbe, so she moved her chair, and making room for Clarence on her left,\r\ntold Mr. Selden to push his chair further to the front, on her right.\r\nThis was a more desirable distribution, and it pleased Clarence better,\r\nfor she would turn her face to him on looking at the stage. Still, there\r\nwas that odious little fellow with his red mutton chops sitting so near\r\nher, that he wanted to pitch him out of the box. Mercedes watched for an\r\nopportunity to say to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou look unhappy; have I done anything to displease you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, never!\xe2\x80\x9d he quickly answered, but did not dare to look at her.\r\nPresently he added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is too painful to think that only for one day\r\nmore I can see you, then we must part, and\xe2\x80\x94and others will be with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you not go with us as far as the Yosemite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence turned quickly to look at her, and her eyes had that sweet,\r\nloving expression which, to him, was always irresistible, entrancing. He\r\nhad never seen it in any other eyes, and in hers only very seldom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! if you will only let me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet you! Your pleasure is the only thing to consult.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I know what I shall do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n                                  \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nNeither Mr. Selden nor Mr. Gunther could sleep that night. Those little\r\ngolden curls over the blue eyes floated in a hazy mist and music in\r\ntantalizing recurrence until dawn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you make a satisfactory bargain?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked Clarence next\r\nmorning, when the ladies had gone to church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as far as we can see at present. I am to send an expert to look at\r\nthe mines to-morrow, and on his report will decide what to do. But I am\r\nin a quandary now about one thing. Have you positively decided to leave\r\nto-morrow at seven A.M.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t oversleep ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d was George\xe2\x80\x99s reply. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that\r\ndepends. Why do you ask? If by waiting a few days we can have your\r\ncompany further on, we will wait, of course. The girls are enjoying\r\nthemselves very much, and will be glad to wait for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, thanks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, warmly. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I would like to go as far\r\nas the Yosemite with you; but as I would like to have one final talk\r\nwith the miners to-morrow before I pay them any money, I would be much\r\nobliged if you could wait until Tuesday morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost willingly, my dear fellow, particularly as these se\xc3\xb1oritas are not\r\nin a hurry to leave fascinating San Francisco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not driven anywhere around the city, and Miss Mercedes wishes\r\nto see more of San Francisco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, \xe2\x80\x9cas she has not seen it\r\nsince she was _twelve months old_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Selden; those fellows will never cease laughing at his mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGeorge said.\r\n\r\nAfter mass, our travelers went immediately to luncheon. At their table\r\nwere already seated the six New Yorkers, but four chairs were carefully\r\nturned, in token of being reserved. Clarence sat next to Mercedes, but\r\nSelden was opposite, and anxiously expected the moment when she would\r\nlift her veil. He dreaded to be disenchanted by finding her to be less\r\nbeautiful in daylight, but such was not the case. She appeared to him\r\neven prettier, seeing better the lovely dark blue of her eyes. He looked\r\nat her in silence, saying to himself mentally: \xe2\x80\x9cShe is exquisite; am I\r\ngoing to love her hopelessly!\xe2\x80\x9d And he looked at Clarence with a pang of\r\njealousy, for he could not deny to himself that he was handsome, yes,\r\nbeautiful as an Apollo, and very manly.\r\n\r\nNext to Selden sat Robert Gunther, making almost the same mental\r\nobservations, and resolving to try and win her in spite of all\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\nLuncheon was much enjoyed by all excepting Mr. Selden, who seemed to get\r\nmore and more nervous as he sat there trying not to look at Mercedes as\r\nmuch as he wished.\r\n\r\nThe Gunther brothers were very brilliant conversationalists, and so was\r\nGeorge, who was in his element in the company of such polished gentlemen\r\nas were now before him. On leaving the table, Mr. Charles Gunther begged\r\nElvira\xe2\x80\x99s permission to pay their respects, asking if it would suit her\r\nconvenience for them to call that evening after dinner, to which she\r\ngracefully assented, and all walked towards the parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go to the Cliff House this afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may, but Mercedes and I are going to vespers,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and\r\nsoon after the two sisters retired to their rooms.\r\n\r\nAs all of the gentlemen walked down to the reading room, Selden said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how in thunder are we going to kill time this afternoon until\r\ndinner? It will be intensely stupid here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought we all were going to drive to the Cliff,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob Gunther said,\r\nmaliciously. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you would rather go to church.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou judge others by yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I do. But our sudden access of religion, I fear, would not be\r\nappreciated. My dear fellow, our piety, like that of his satanic\r\nmajesty, would be distrusted. It would edify no one, only make us\r\nridiculous. Let us go to the Cliff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd to the Cliff all went, but the drive was not much enjoyed. Bob and\r\nSelden were quarrelsome, and all the others laughed at them, which ended\r\nby making them surly. Selden ridiculed the San Franciscans for their\r\nstupid Cliff House, while all sat in arm-chairs on the broad veranda and\r\nlooked at the Pacific Ocean, and Pacific sea lions, and Pacific rocks,\r\nand thought them all equally monotonous. To watch the ugly sea beasts\r\nawkwardly dragging their unwieldly hulks up the rocks, there to spread\r\nthemselves in the sun, was not a very exhilarating spectacle for young\r\ngentlemen who desired to see other kinds of lions. Sunday not being the\r\nfashionable day for San Franciscans to drive to the Cliff, the New\r\nYorkers concluded that the elite would not be seen that afternoon and\r\nreturned to the hotel.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner several lady friends, who had received Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s wedding\r\ncards and had seen her and Mercedes at church that morning, called.\r\n\r\nThe cards of the New Yorkers, also, were brought, and they followed\r\nimmediately. Elvira presented them very gracefully, while George watched\r\nwith delighted attention the perfect ease and natural elegance with\r\nwhich she did the honors as hostess.\r\n\r\nRobert Gunther and Arthur Selden seated themselves in a corner, on the\r\nright of Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 chair, but Clarence held his place on the end of the\r\nsofa, very near her.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mr. Charles Gunther said to them:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch as it pains me to tear myself away, young men, it must be done,\r\nfor we have made _a first call_ of nearly two hours\xe2\x80\x99 duration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has not seemed to us nearly so long,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was no more than two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob Gunther added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you exaggerate,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Selden exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk him how long it has seemed to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would not dare. He thinks you exaggerate, that is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\nMercedes.\r\n\r\nSelden gave her a look of tender reproach, and a savage one at Bob, as\r\nhe bowed, leaving the room.\r\n\r\nBy nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock Monday morning Clarence had received the certificates of\r\nassay he had ordered on Saturday afternoon. It seemed to him that there\r\nmust be a mistake somewhere about the rock, for these assays gave even a\r\nhigher percentage than those shown him by the miners. He went to\r\nHubert\xe2\x80\x99s office and found Fred already there waiting for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Hubert, are you sure that these men did not bring us this\r\nrich rock from some other mine? The assays are very high. One goes as\r\nhigh as $2000 per ton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey might have selected the specimens, but I can vouch for their being\r\nfrom the same ledge, for I know the rock. I can also vouch for the\r\nhonesty of the men, for I know them well; besides, what would be the\r\ngood of telling a falsehood that would be found out the minute the\r\nexpert got there? Their reputation is worth more to them than the five\r\nhundred dollars that you will pay now,\xe2\x80\x9d was Hubert\xe2\x80\x99s reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are good men. I have known them for years, and have had them\r\nworking with me,\xe2\x80\x9d Fred added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let us finish this business now, for I go out of town to-morrow\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, and in half an hour he had explained his views\r\nand wishes and made his contract with Fred Haverly, the terms of which\r\nhad been already mentioned on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The\r\nminers now came and the contract with them, also, was made and\r\nacknowledged in due form.\r\n\r\nBy twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock that day Clarence had dispatched his business with the\r\nminers and with Fred Haverly, reserving until he returned instructions\r\nregarding his Alameda farm.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon all drove to the Cliff House. The ugly sea lions did\r\nnot seem so clumsy to Mr. Selden, as Mercedes laughed, amused to see\r\ntheir ungainly efforts at locomotion, and as she pronounced the Pacific\r\nOcean to be grand and the wild surf dashing madly against the impassive\r\nrocks very impressive, Mr. Selden was of the same way of thinking, and\r\nfound the sea lions rather graceful and dignified, the black rocks more\r\ninteresting than they had been the day before.\r\n\r\nThe gayeties of San Francisco made time slip away magically, and a week\r\npassed in receptions, drives and yacht sailing, in honor of Elvira,\r\nseemed very short indeed. But now another week had begun, and the\r\njourney eastward must be resumed.\r\n\r\nOur travelers took an early breakfast on Tuesday morning, and by seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock they left the hotel. Half an hour later, they were on the\r\nOakland boat, crossing San Francisco Bay on their way to New York.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is plenty of room here for all the navies of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d George\r\nobserved, looking at the harbor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe the bay is forty miles across,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Clarence. \xe2\x80\x9cFor\r\nall intents and purposes at present, however, San Diego Bay is as good\r\nas this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I only wish we had commerce enough for ships to be crowded there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Colonel Scott succeeds in constructing his railroad, there is no\r\ndoubt that San Diego will be a large city in a few years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that, but the question is, will Colonel Scott succeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he will, but he has a hard crowd to fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence mused a little, then, changing his position so as to face\r\nGeorge, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have had an idea in my head, a sort of project, I want to talk to you\r\nabout. Of course, its practicability, I fear, will entirely depend upon\r\nthe building of the Texas Pacific Railroad; for if San Diego is not to\r\nhave population, my plan will be impracticable. It is this: The two\r\nbanks in San Diego, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, have a paid-up capital of more than a\r\nhundred thousand dollars. I think we could establish a bank of two or\r\nthree hundred thousand dollars that would be a paying institution. I\r\nheard you say that you thought you would like to come to California, so\r\nas to be near your family. That gave me the idea of starting a bank. You\r\ncould be the president and manager, and I would furnish as much of the\r\ncapital as suited you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour idea is splendid, nothing could suit me better; but I suppose we\r\nwill have to see whether we are to have a railroad or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is the sole and unavoidable condition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we will know next winter, and if it be decided that the Texas\r\nPacific is to be built, I will immediately accept your proposition, and\r\nput in some money with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can take half, or a third of the stock, and put in some money for Don\r\nGabriel and Victoriano; and Everett can come in, too. You can easily\r\ninstruct Don Gabriel in the banking business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would make a good cashier; he is a good bookkeeper already. I think\r\nI could put in twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you put in twenty-five thousand, I will put in that much for each of\r\nthe others, Don Gabriel, Tano and Retty, and one hundred thousand for\r\nmyself, or will put in thirty thousand for Don Gabriel and ninety-five\r\nthousand for myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be the president.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want you and Don Gabriel to have the entire management. You can\r\ntake in Tano and Retty, if you like, if they prove themselves efficient;\r\nbut as for myself, I want to be free to attend to those mines (if they\r\nare worth working) and take care of my Alameda farm. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think\r\nthat two hundred thousand will be enough to start? I can put in more, if\r\nnecessary, by selling some of my United States bonds. I have seven\r\nhundred and fifty thousand in United States securities, which I can\r\nconvert into money at any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo hundred thousand is more than enough. We can increase the capital,\r\nif we wish, afterward. I am glad you are so well fixed in government\r\nsecurities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have had a round million if I had not sold my stock too soon;\r\nbut my father kept talking to me so much against dealing in mining\r\nstocks, that I ordered Hubert Haverly to sell all I had. Fortunately he\r\nheld on for a few days to my Crown Point, and sold for nine hundred\r\nthousand dollars. I was sorry enough to have lost a million for being so\r\nobedient a son, and when in that mood I promised Hubert I would not\r\ninterfere again, but let him manage my stocks as he thought best. Since\r\nthen he has done very well, so that now I have seven hundred and fifty\r\nthousand in United States bonds, my farm, for which Hubert paid ninety\r\nthousand, some town lots in San Francisco, and about one hundred and\r\nsixty thousand dollars in bank, besides the interest on my bonds, which\r\nI have not drawn for over a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that makes you worth over a million.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but if I had kept my Crown Point for a few days longer I could\r\nhave sold for a million and a half. However, I think the Arizona mines\r\nwill reward my filial obedience,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cand if we can\r\nstart that bank I shall be satisfied. I think it is a pity that such men\r\nas Don Mariano and his sons do not have some other better-paying\r\nbusiness than cattle-raising. It used to pay well, but I fear it never\r\nwill again, while such absurdities as the \xe2\x80\x98_No-Fence Laws_\xe2\x80\x99 are allowed\r\nto exist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I heard Don Mariano say to my father: \xe2\x80\x98I am sure I am to be\r\nlegislated into a _rancheria_, as there is no poor-house in San Diego to\r\nput me into,\xe2\x80\x99 he said it smiling, but his smile was very sad. However,\r\nwhen the appeal is dismissed and he is rid of squatters, he will\r\nrecuperate, provided, of course, there be a Texas Pacific to make San\r\nDiego lands valuable. Without it the prospect is gloomy indeed, I may\r\nwell say dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it; it all depends upon that railroad, I am sorry to say, when\r\nwe are so powerless to counteract hostile influences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must hope and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\xe2\x80\x94_Journeying Overland._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crashing and thundering of Yosemite\xe2\x80\x99s falls plunging from dizzy\r\nheights, in splendor of furious avalanches, had been left behind.\r\n\r\nGeorge and his three companions had given the last lingering look\r\ntowards the glorious rainbows and myriads of dazzling gems glittering in\r\nthe sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays, which pierced the vertical streams and played through\r\nthe spray and mist enveloping them.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the mirror lakes, with their gorgeous borders of green,\r\ntheir rich bouquets of fragrant azaleas and pond lilies, as well as the\r\ntowering cliffs, the overpowering heights of that wonderful valley, all\r\nmade a picture to remain forevermore a cherished souvenir.\r\n\r\nBut alas, for the fatality of human joys, all is evanescent in this\r\nworld of ours; the moment of parting at last came for the lovers.\r\n\r\nThe west-bound train would pass the station first, so Clarence must be\r\nthe one to leave his friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite to us soon, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, as soon as I get to San Diego.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite before, and let us know what you are doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, I will do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and looked at Mercedes, who with\r\ndown-cast eyes, felt his gaze but dared not look up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fail to write the long letter you promised, after you have your\r\ntalk with papa, and he has explained to mamma your position,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my all-absorbing thought. There is no danger of my failing to\r\nsee Don Mariano the first minute I can do so. I will write immediately.\r\nTo whom shall I direct my letter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo me, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand you will write to Mercita also,\r\nafter matters have been explained to mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe distant rumbling as if of coming earthquake, and a far off shriek\r\nwere now heard. In another minute the round-eyed monster was there, and\r\nsnorting maliciously, rushed off with Clarence, leaving Mercedes leaning\r\non George\xe2\x80\x99s arm, scarcely able to stand, and hardly realizing that\r\nClarence had left them.\r\n\r\nShe was still very pale, and her hands yet trembled, when the thundering\r\nof the east-bound train was heard in the distance. Two shrieks pierced\r\nthe air simultaneously, as the two trains passed each other. Her heart\r\ngave accelerated throbs when she heard those shrieks, because she knew\r\nthat one of them came from the train which bore Clarence away, and it\r\nseemed to her as if expressive of his pain at being torn from her. Yes,\r\nthat magician, the locomotive, understood it all, and shrieked to say he\r\ndid so, because he knew she, too, wished to shriek like that.\r\n\r\nWhat would you, my reader? She was so young\xe2\x80\x94only seventeen\xe2\x80\x94and in love.\r\nThe poor child was naturally indulging in all sorts of foolish fancies\r\nwhile looking at the woods through which he had disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut there was now the east-bound train, and George taking her towards\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe laughed loudly as they walked to the cars, and Elvira asked why he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI declare, Mercedes, you must have fascinated those two fellows more\r\nthan is good for them\xe2\x80\x94for there they are as large as life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho, George?\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, who should it be but Selden and Bob Gunther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Mercedes. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease George get a compartment where we can\r\nbe by ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d implored she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will; you shall have it if money or influence or anything short of\r\nmurder can get it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, helping them up the car steps. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in the\r\nmeantime I am going to locate you here, while I go to interview the\r\nconductor and porter. This is the last car\xe2\x80\x94you will be here unobserved.\r\nThose fellows did not see us get in.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, George went off,\r\nlaughing heartily.\r\n\r\nNeither conductor nor porter were to be found in the next car, or the\r\nnext to that, and George made his way through them as quickly as their\r\njolting and swinging permitted.\r\n\r\nAt the further end of the fourth car he spied a porter talking with two\r\nforeign-looking gentlemen, who were none other than Messrs. Gunther and\r\nSelden. Their backs were turned toward him, so he had time to approach\r\nthem unobserved, near enough to hear Selden say, in his anglicised\r\naccents:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my good fellah, we were told positively that travelers going from\r\nthe Yosemite east must get on the train here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so they do,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, laying his hand on Selden\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove! we\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x99em!\xe2\x80\x9d ejaculated Gunther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere they are,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden said, with radiant face, seizing hold of\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s hands, which he shook emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here! let me have one of his hands, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gunther;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat an all-absorbing fellow you continue to be, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile George gave a hand to each, he told the porter he wanted a\r\ncompartment, if such was to be had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are none disengaged, sir, except some of those little ones at the\r\nend of the car, which no one wants; but you can have a section if you\r\nlike,\xe2\x80\x9d the porter replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have that already; but the ladies with me want a good, large\r\ncompartment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have one which we will be most happy to place at your service,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGunther said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd rob you of it. That wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it would, as we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for it. And it is very nice and private,\r\nand the ladies should have it,\xe2\x80\x9d Selden said, warmly.\r\n\r\nAs the section which George\xe2\x80\x99s tickets assigned to him was the very next\r\nto the apartment in question, it was very clear to Mr. Selden that no\r\narrangement could have been more fortunate, and he said so.\r\n\r\nThe three then went to bring the ladies to their room.\r\n\r\nMercedes pleaded a headache, and George knew that she wished to be\r\nalone, to have a cry all to herself, as most girls would, when their\r\nsweethearts have just left them. So he said to Elvira:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes had better lie down for a while. If she sleeps she will feel\r\nbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so; I will join you presently,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira answered. And hearing\r\nthis the gentlemen retired.\r\n\r\nMercedes took her hat and gloves and cloak off, and sat at the window\r\n_to enjoy_ her misery in a thorough womanly fashion. She fixed her eyes\r\non the far-off, flying wall of verdure, seeing nothing, not even the\r\ntall trees which, close by, indulged in such grotesque antics, as if\r\nforgetting their stately dignity only to amuse her\xe2\x80\x94making dancing\r\ndervishes of themselves, and converting that portion of the Pacific\r\nslope into a flying gymnasium to perform athletic exercises, rushing on\r\nmadly, or even turning somersaults for her recreation.\r\n\r\nElvira left her alone with her thoughts, and silently devoted herself to\r\nunpacking their satchels, arranging their toilet things, traveling\r\nshawls and night-dresses and comfortable slippers all in their proper\r\nplaces. She then took her hat off, and tying a large black veil over her\r\nhead (Spanish fashion), told her sister to sleep if she could, and not\r\nto cry, for, after all, Clarence would soon be in New York.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 sad voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, I do. Clarence is too energetic and too much in love to be\r\nkept away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut mamma\xe2\x80\x94you know mamma\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich will be entirely changed when she hears that Clarence is no\r\nsquatter. Leave all that to papa. Come, give me a kiss, and if you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsleep, put a veil over your head and come out. I am going to join the\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, darling, you go; but at present I\xe2\x80\x99d rather sit here by the\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she sat there, but the sad blue orbs saw nothing\xe2\x80\x94for her mental gaze\r\nwas fixed on that other flying train, that was rushing away, carrying\r\nher beloved with such frightful rapidity. She felt, she _knew_, Clarence\r\nwas sitting by a car window, thinking of her, gazing blankly at his\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\nAnd so he was.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that his misery would have been greatly intensified\r\nhad he caught a glimpse of Messrs. Gunther and Selden, as they rushed\r\npast him on their eastward journey. This aggravation, however, was\r\nspared him. And, as when he arrived at San Francisco, Charles Gunther\r\nand his three companions had already left for Oregon, Clarence remained,\r\nfor the present, in blissful ignorance of the whereabouts of those two\r\npersistent young gentlemen, traveling so near Mercedes.\r\n\r\nBut could magician of old have shown to him in enchanted mirror the\r\nimage of his beloved, he would have read in those expressive eyes how\r\nsadly she felt his absence.\r\n\r\nWhen she had sat there, motionless, for two hours, Elvira came to tell\r\nher to get ready for dinner, which she declined doing, saying that she\r\nwas not a bit hungry. And so the day passed\xe2\x80\x94the night came\xe2\x80\x94and she did\r\nnot gladden the hearts of their traveling companions, by letting them\r\nsee her that day. Next day the morning hours also passed. She had her\r\nbreakfast in her room.\r\n\r\nMr. Selden began to feel piqued and Mr. Gunther nervous. They and Elvira\r\nwere playing a three-handed game of casino; George was elsewhere,\r\ntalking to an acquaintance he had met on the train.\r\n\r\nPresently, softly and unexpectedly, the sliding-door of the compartment\r\nmoved, and Mercedes stood beside Mr. Selden, sweet as a rosebud, smiling\r\nin her most bewitching way. The blood mounted to Mr. Selden\xe2\x80\x99s temples,\r\nand those of Mr. Gunther\xe2\x80\x99s assumed the same hue. Then she, of course,\r\nblushed also\xe2\x80\x94for she could never see any one blush without doing the\r\nvery same thing herself.\r\n\r\nElvira alone kept her composure, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Baby! I am so glad you\r\nfeel better. Come, take a hand, for these gentlemen will cut your\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s throat, or she theirs. We are having a fierce battle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Will you have me for a partner, Mr. Gunther? I warn you that\r\nI am a very poor player,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have you for a partner, Miss Mercedes, on any terms, and be most\r\nhappy to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Gunther, with more emphasis than the occasion\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat being the case, I am ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, sitting by her sister,\r\nthereby being diagonally opposite to Mr. Gunther.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the five travelers were constantly together, and the days\r\npassed delightfully for all during the entire journey, especially so to\r\nGunther and Selden. They had no occasion to complain of Mercedes for\r\nstaying away. She most amiably took part in all their games and other\r\namusements, their walks while waiting at stations, their conversations\r\nduring the sentimental and delightful twilight hours. She had found that\r\nboth young gentlemen were a most excellent protection against one\r\nanother, as neither one was ever willing to go leaving her alone with\r\nthe other. As for ardent loving looks, she knew that the best way of\r\neluding them was by having recourse to her little trick of dropping her\r\ngaze, as if she must look down for something missing near by. That\r\nlittle trick came to her from sheer timidity and bashfulness long ago.\r\nIn fact, she was unconscious of it, until Corina Holman had told her\r\nthat whenever Clarence Darrell was present she became sly, and did not\r\ndare to look at people squarely in the face\xe2\x80\x94that she was the veriest\r\nhypocrite. Thus she learned that her bashful timidity had been entirely\r\nmisunderstood, but she was also made aware that she had accidentally\r\ndiscovered how to avoid looks which were best not to meet\xe2\x80\x94best to avoid\r\nby simply dropping her gaze. As her long, curly lashes veiled her eyes\r\nwith a silken fringe, they could hide under that cover like two little\r\ncherubs crouching under their own wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\xe2\x80\x94_Spanish Land Grants Viewed Retrospectively._\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Francisco seemed deserted, dusty and desolate to Clarence after his\r\nreturn from the Yosemite and the society of Mercedes. It was the step\r\nfrom the sublime to the ridiculous; so he ran off to his Alameda farm\r\nand remained there until the day before the steamer would leave for San\r\nDiego. He then came back late to the dusty city and went in search of\r\nHubert to take him to dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake to dine with me and talk to me. I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat alone,\r\nI am too blue,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, going to Hubert\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, my boy. You are the very man I wanted to see, for I have\r\nbeen slashing into your stocks like all possessed;\xe2\x80\x9d and he made cuts and\r\nthrusts in the air illustrative of a terrible havoc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you done?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence asked, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in the first place, I have sold all your Yellow Jacket, all your\r\nSavage and half of your Ophir, and I bought you some Consolidated\r\nVirginia and California. What do you say to that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot one word, for I suppose you know what you are about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I do, and, as a proof of it, I made for you twenty thousand\r\ndollars clear profit by the operation, besides buying your Consolidated\r\nVirginia. So if that last venture is a failure, I shall not feel I have\r\nswamped all your cash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say not. You are the prince of brokers, Berty. You have not\r\nmade a single mistake in managing my stock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I have. I sold your Crown Point too soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that was my mistake, not yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it was. I ought to have sold half to fool you, and kept the other\r\nhalf ten days longer to make a million with it. I was stupidly honest\r\nthat time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t forgive myself, nor you either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that. You are only piling coals of fire on my head. Now I have\r\nto bear twenty thousand more fresh coals, and I forbearingly say: \xe2\x80\x98Pile\r\non Macduff,\xe2\x80\x99 _et cetera_. Where shall we go to dinner\xe2\x80\x94the Poodle Dog or\r\nCalifornia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go to the California House. John keeps the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo the California House they went, and had a most excellent dinner with\r\nChateau Yquem and a bottle of Roderer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know I like some of our California wines quite as well as the\r\nimported, if not better? I suppose I ought to be ashamed to admit it,\r\nthus showing that my taste is not cultivated. But that is the simple\r\ntruth. There is that flavor of the real genuine grape which our\r\nCalifornia wines have that is different from the imported. I think\r\nsooner or later our wines will be better liked, better appreciated,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nClarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so too, but for the present it is the fashion to cry down our\r\nnative wines and extol the imported. When foreigners come to California\r\nto tell us that we can make good wines, that we have soils in which to\r\ngrow the best grapes, then we will believe it, not before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two friends went after dinner to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s rooms, where they spent\r\nthe evening together. Twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock found them still busy talking of a\r\nthousand things. Next morning Hubert came to breakfast with Clarence and\r\naccompanied him to the steamer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, old fellow; take care of yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, my boy; good luck to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said they, with a lingering grip of\r\nthe hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Fred has had a safe journey,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, and I hope soon to get his telegram\xe2\x80\x94about his \xe2\x80\x98_first\r\nimpression_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94which I shall transmit to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more Clarence was crossing San Francisco Bay\xe2\x80\x94on to the Golden Gate,\r\non to the broad Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding scenery recalled Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 image so vividly to his mind\r\nthat it made his heart long to see her, and the entire voyage was\r\npainful to him with the keen regret of her absence.\r\n\r\nBut now, again, on the fourth morning\xe2\x80\x94a lovely one in the sunlit July\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwas once more making his way between Ballast Point and the sandy\r\npeninsula, facing La Playa and then turning to the right towards San\r\nDiego City.\r\n\r\nSan Diego at that time\xe2\x80\x94in July, 1873\xe2\x80\x94be it remembered, was fresh and\r\nrosy with bright hopes, like a healthy child just trying to stand up,\r\nwith no sickness or ill-usage to sap its vitality and weaken its limbs.\r\nOnly ten months before Col. Scott had come to say that the Texas Pacific\r\nRailroad would be built through the shortest, most practicable route,\r\nmaking San Diego the western terminus of _the shortest transcontinental\r\nrailway_. It was true that on the following winter Congress had done\r\nnothing further to help the Texas Pacific. But many reasons were given\r\nfor this singular lack of interest in so important a matter on the part\r\nof Congress. Among the many reasons, _the true one_ was not mentioned,\r\nhardly suspected; it would have seemed too monstrous to have been\r\nbelieved all at once; incredible if revealed without preparing the mind\r\nfor its reception. Yes, the mind had to be prepared\xe2\x80\x94slowly educated\r\nfirst. Now it has been. The process began about that time and it has\r\ncontinued up to this day, this very moment in which I write this page.\r\nMr. Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s letters have taught us how San Diego was robbed,\r\ntricked, and cheated out of its inheritance. We will look at these\r\nletters further on.\r\n\r\nWhen the steamer arrived near enough to the wharf for persons to be\r\nrecognized, Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s heart leaped with pleasure, for he saw the well\r\nknown, tall form of Don Mariano sitting in his buggy leaning back,\r\nlooking at the approaching steamer. A minute after, he saw Victoriano\r\nand Everett standing together near the edge of the wharf ready to\r\nreceive him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Runaway, welcome back!\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano said, clasping Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand as soon as he was upon the wharf. He gave the other hand to\r\nEverett, who said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will have to _lazo_ you to keep you home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we will have to put a yoke on him,\xe2\x80\x9d added Victoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; only let me select my yokefellow,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, laughing.\r\n\r\nAs Don Mariano intended returning home that day, Clarence proposed that\r\nVictoriano should drive with Everett, and he go with Don Mariano, an\r\narrangement which was very satisfactory to all parties. He was very\r\nanxious to unburden his mind, and Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries about his\r\ndaughters and their voyage to San Francisco soon gave him the desired\r\nopportunity. He told Don Mariano what George had said, and how firmly\r\nand sincerely Mercedes wished to abide by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s wishes. Don\r\nMariano listened very attentively, then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had intended suggesting to you the same thing. Gabriel has spoken to\r\nme about the matter several times, insisting that all the ladies of our\r\nfamily ought to know that _you_ paid for your land. Since we cannot\r\ndivest them of the resentment they have towards squatters, let them know\r\nthe truth. Let them see that Congress, if it does not always follow\r\nmoral principles, can certainly subvert them most arbitrarily and\r\ndisastrously. Do you still wish to keep the matter from your father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence thought for a moment, then answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but only for a short time. I suppose we will have to define our\r\nposition as soon as the appeal is dismissed. Before that comes, I shall\r\nexplain all to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey rode on in silence for a few moments; then Don Mariano said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I shall tell my wife that, for the present, the matter must\r\nnot be mentioned outside the family or in the hearing of servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said: \xe2\x80\x9cit is very painful to me to find my\r\nfather adhering so tenaciously to his old conviction that all Mexican\r\ngrants not finally confirmed to their owners are public land, and being\r\nso, they are open for settlement to all American citizens. Thus, he\r\nstill insists that, being an American citizen, he has the right to\r\nlocate on your land or any other unconfirmed grant. This idea has been\r\nthe bane of his life for many years, but for the very reason that in\r\nmaintaining it he has caused so much trouble to himself and to others,\r\nhe seems to cling to it most pertinaciously. He believes your land was\r\nrejected, and that the rejection will be sustained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my land was reported rejected, but it was by some mistake of the\r\nclerks, because at that time the title had not been either finally\r\nrejected or confirmed. It had been before the Land Commission, and that\r\n(of course) decided adversely, as it generally did. Then I appealed to\r\nthe United States District Court. This said that there was not\r\nsufficient testimony to confirm my title, but did not affirm the opinion\r\nof the Land Commission, nor reverse their decision, nor enter a decree\r\nof rejection. It simply left the case in that uncertain condition until\r\n1870, when I discharged my lawyer and engaged another to attend to the\r\nsuit. Then the case was reopened, and a decree of confirmation was\r\nentered. In the meantime, squatters had been coming, and they now have\r\ncarried their appeal to Washington, to the United States Supreme Court,\r\nagainst me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it all now,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t find it in my\r\nheart to blame those people for taking my land as much as I blame the\r\nlegislators who turned them loose upon me? And least of all I blame your\r\nfather, for he has not killed my cattle, as the others have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that. That would\r\nbe worse than the lowest theft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, but there is a law to protect him if he did; in fact, to\r\n_authorize_ him to do so. Thus, you see, here again come _our\r\nlegislators_ to encourage again wrong-doing\xe2\x80\x94to offer a premium to one\r\nclass of citizens to go and prey upon another class. All this is wrong.\r\nI hold that the legislators of a nation are the guardians of public\r\nmorality, the teachers of what is right and just. They should never\r\nenact laws that are not founded upon rectitude, as Herbert Spencer says,\r\nno matter if expedience or adventitious circumstances might seem to\r\ndemand it. But I need not tell you this, for you hold the same opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do, and understanding your rights better than I did, I think\r\nyou were too generous in making the offer you made to the settlers at\r\nthe meeting with them last year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was rather generous, but not as much so as you perhaps think. I was\r\nlooking out for myself, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard them talk about an appeal that was pending, and I thought it\r\nwas your appeal, not theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe position then was this: In the first place, I was willing to give\r\nthem a chance of getting good homes for their families, for I shall\r\nalways consider that the law has deluded and misled them, and helped\r\nthem to develop their natural inclination to appropriate what belonged\r\nto some one else; so they should bear only half the blame for being\r\nsquatters\xe2\x80\x94Congress must bear the other half. Then, in the second place,\r\nabout the time I had that meeting, I had just received a letter from\r\nGeorge, written at Washington, telling me how the Solicitor General had\r\ndisobeyed the order of the Attorney General, instructing him to dismiss\r\nthe appeal against the confirmation of my title. As I did not know that\r\nthe Solicitor General was acting thus out of pique or personal animosity\r\nagainst the Attorney General, I naturally feared that he was going to\r\nmake me suffer other worse outrages, judging by his arbitrary,\r\nirresponsible conduct. I thought that there might be many more years of\r\ndelay while waiting for the dismissal of the appeal, and while thus\r\nwaiting all my cattle would be killed. Reasoning thus, I concluded that\r\nit would be less ruinous to me to make the concessions I offered than to\r\nwait for tardy justice to restore my land to me\xe2\x80\x94restore it when all my\r\ncattle shall have been destroyed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think your reasoning was correct\xe2\x80\x94it did seem as if the Solicitor\r\nmeant mischief. It was fortunate that he dropped the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for which I am devoutly thankful. I hope the mischief he has done\r\nmay soon be corrected by the Attorney General. Of course, the additional\r\neighteen months of depredations on my cattle which I have had to endure,\r\nmust go unredressed together with all else I have had to suffer at the\r\nhands of those vandals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the hands of our law-givers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. I shall always lay it at the door of our legislators\xe2\x80\x94that they\r\nhave not only caused me to suffer many outrages, but, with those same\r\nlaws, they are sapping the very life essence of public morality. They\r\nare teaching the people to lose all respect for the rights of others\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nlose all respect for their national honor. Because we, _the natives_ of\r\nCalifornia, the Spano-Americans, were, at the close of the war with\r\nMexico, left in the lap of the American nation, or, rather, huddled at\r\nher feet like motherless, helpless children, Congress _thought_ we might\r\nas well be kicked and cuffed as treated kindly. There was no one to be\r\nour champion, no one to take our part and object to our being robbed. It\r\nought to have been sufficient that by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo\r\nthe national faith, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s honor was pledged to respect our\r\nproperty. They never thought of that. With very unbecoming haste,\r\nCongress hurried to pass laws to legalize their despoliation of the\r\nconquered Californians, forgetting the nation\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to protect us. Of\r\ncourse, for opening our land to squatters and then establishing a land\r\ncommission to sanction and corroborate that outrage, _our California\r\ndelegation_ then in Washington, must bear the bulk of the blame. They\r\nshould have opposed the passage of such laws instead of favoring their\r\nenactment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did they favor such legislation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause California was expected to be filled with a population of\r\nfarmers, of industrious settlers who would have votes and would want\r\ntheir one hundred and sixty acres each of the best land to be had. As\r\nour legislators thought that we, the Spano-American natives, had the\r\nbest lands, and but few votes, there was nothing else to be done but to\r\ndespoil us, to take our lands and give them to the coming population.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that was outrageous. Their motive was a political object.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. The motive was that our politicians wanted _votes_. The\r\nsquatters were in increasing majority; the Spanish natives, in\r\ndiminishing minority. Then the cry was raised that our land grants were\r\ntoo large; that a few lazy, thriftless, ignorant natives, holding such\r\nlarge tracts of land, would be a hindrance to the prosperity of the\r\nState, because such lazy people would never cultivate their lands, and\r\nwere even too sluggish to sell them. The cry was taken up and became\r\npopular. It was so easy to upbraid, to deride, to despise the conquered\r\nrace! Then to despoil them, to make them beggars, seemed to be, if not\r\nabsolutely righteous, certainly highly justifiable. Any one not\r\nacquainted with the real facts might have supposed that there was no\r\nmore land to be had in California but that which belonged to the\r\nnatives. Everybody seemed to have forgotten that for each acre that was\r\nowned by them, there were thousands vacant, belonging to the Government,\r\nand which any one can have at one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre.\r\nNo, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want Government land. The settlers want the lands of the\r\nlazy, the thriftless Spaniards. Such good-for-nothing, helpless wretches\r\nare not fit to own such lordly tracts of land. It was wicked to tolerate\r\nthe waste, the extravagance of the Mexican Government, in giving such\r\nlarge tracts of land to a few individuals. The American Government never\r\ncould have been, or ever could be, guilty of such thing. No, never! But,\r\nbehold! Hardly a dozen years had passed, when this same economical,\r\nfar-seeing Congress, which was so ready to snatch away from the Spanish\r\npeople their lands (which rightfully belonged to them) on the plea that\r\nsuch large tracts of land ought not to belong to _a few_ individuals,\r\nthis same Congress, mind you, goes to work and gives to railroad\r\ncompanies millions upon millions of acres of land. It is true that such\r\ngifts were for the purpose of aiding enterprises for the good of the\r\npeople. Yes, but that was exactly the same motive which guided the\r\nSpanish and the Mexican governments\xe2\x80\x94to give large tracts of land as an\r\ninducement to those citizens who would utilize the wilderness of the\r\ngovernment domain\xe2\x80\x94utilize it by starting ranchos which afterwards would\r\noriginate \xe2\x80\x98pueblos\xe2\x80\x99 or villages, and so on. The fact that these\r\nland-owners who established large ranchos were very efficient and\r\nfaithful collaborators in the foundation of missions, was also taken\r\ninto consideration by the Spanish Government or the viceroys of Mexico.\r\nThe land-owners were useful in many ways, though to a limited extent\r\nthey attracted population by employing white labor. They also employed\r\nIndians, who thus began to be less wild. Then in times of Indian\r\noutbreaks, the land-owners with their servants would turn out as in\r\nfeudal times in Europe, to assist in the defense of the missions and the\r\nsparsely settled country threatened by the savages. Thus, you see, that\r\nit was not a foolish extravagance, but a judicious policy which induced\r\nthe viceroys and Spanish governors to begin the system of giving large\r\nland grants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never knew that this was the object of the Spanish and Mexican\r\ngovernments in granting large tracts of land, but it seems to me a very\r\nwise plan when there was so much land and so few settlers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely. It was a good policy. In fact, the only one in those days of\r\na patriarchal sort of life, when raising cattle was the principal\r\noccupation of the Californians.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must say that to establish the Land Commission seems to me rather a\r\nsmall subterfuge for the Congress of a great nation to resort to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes this subterfuge a cold-blooded wrong, of premeditated\r\ngravity, is the fact that at the time when we were forced to submit our\r\ntitles for revision, and pending these legal proceedings, we, the\r\nland-owners, began to pay taxes, and the squatters were told that they\r\nhave the right to take our lands and keep them until we should prove\r\nthat we had good titles to them. If the law had obliged us to submit our\r\ntitles to the inspection of the Land Commission, but had not opened our\r\nranchos to settlers _until it had been proved that our titles were not\r\ngood_, and if, too, taxes were paid by those who derived the benefit\r\nfrom the land, then there would be some color of equity in such laws.\r\nBut is not this a subversion of all fundamental principles of justice?\r\nHere we are, living where we have lived for fifty or eighty years; the\r\nsquatters are turned loose upon us to take our lands, and we must pay\r\ntaxes for them, and we must go to work to prove that our lands are ours\r\nbefore the squatter goes. Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the squatter prove first that the\r\nland is his, and why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he pay his own taxes? We, as plaintiffs,\r\nhave to bear heavy expenses, and as the delays and evasions of the law\r\nare endless, the squatter has generally managed to keep the land he\r\ntook, for we have been impoverished by heavy taxation while trying to\r\nprove our rights, and the squatter has been making money out of our\r\nlands to fight us with. Generally the Californians have had nothing but\r\nland to pay their taxes, besides paying their lawyers to defend their\r\ntitles. Thus, often the lawyer has taken all that was left out of the\r\ncost of litigation and taxes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me heartsick to think how unjustly the native Californians\r\nhave been treated. I assure you, sir, that not one American in a million\r\nknows of this outrage. If they did, they would denounce it in the\r\nbitterest language; they would not tolerate it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would denounce it perhaps, but they would tolerate it. I used to\r\nthink as you do, that the American people had a very direct influence\r\nupon the legislation of the country. It seems so to hear public speakers\r\nin election times, but half of all their fire goes up in smoke, and\r\nCongress is left coolly to do as it pleases. And the worst of it is,\r\nthat this very arbitrary Congress, so impervious to appeals of\r\nsufferers, is also led by a few persistent men who with determination do\r\nall things, spoil or kill good bills, and doctor up sick ones; and then\r\nthey half-fool and half-weary the nation into acquiescence, for what can\r\nwe do? The next batch that is sent to the Capitol will have the same\r\nelements in it, and repeat history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me there ought to be some way to punish men for being bad\r\nor ineffectual legislators, when sense of honor or dread of criticism\r\nfail to make them do their duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano sighed and shook his head, then in a very sad voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat should be so, but it is not the case. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any remedy\r\nin my life-time. I am afraid there is no help for us native\r\nCalifornians. We must sadly fade and pass away. The weak and the\r\nhelpless are always trampled in the throng. We must sink, go under,\r\nnever to rise. If the Americans had been friendly to us, and helped us\r\nwith good, protective laws, our fate would have been different. But to\r\nlegislate us into poverty is to legislate us into our graves. Their very\r\ncontact is deadly to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet you do not seem to hate us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHate you? No, indeed! Never! The majority of my best friends are\r\nAmericans. Instead of hate, I feel great attraction toward the American\r\npeople. Their sentiments, their ways of thinking suit me, with but few\r\nexceptions. I am fond of the Americans. I know that, as a matter of\r\nfact, only the very mean and narrow-minded have harsh feelings against\r\nmy race. The trouble, the misfortune has been that the American people\r\nfelt perfect indifference towards the conquered few. We were not in\r\nsufficient numbers to command attention. We were left to the tender\r\nmercies of Congress, and the American nation never gave us a thought\r\nafter the treaty of peace with Mexico was signed. Probably any other\r\nnation would have done the same. Why should I then hate them? No,\r\nindeed. But I confess my heart collapses when I think what might be the\r\nfate of my family if I am not able to avert the ruin which has overtaken\r\nthe majority of Californians. We have not been millionaires, but we have\r\nnever known want. We are all ill prepared for poverty; and yet this\r\nlong-delayed justice, and the squatters crowding me so relentlessly\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nstopped short, then added: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not giving you a cheerful welcome with\r\nmy gloomy conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want you to talk to me frankly and give me your views. You have\r\ntold me much that I had never heard before, and which I am glad to\r\nlearn. But as for feeling gloomy about the future of the family, I think\r\na plan that Mr. George Mechlin and myself have been forming will make\r\nthings rather better for the future, and we trust you will approve it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the plan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\xe2\x80\x94_Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa at Home._\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Mariano had only said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the plan?\xe2\x80\x9d a very natural and simple\r\ninquiry, and yet it threw Clarence into something of a flutter, as it\r\nflashed vividly before his mind that the said _plan_ was based entirely\r\nupon the fate of the Texas Pacific Railroad, and that as a natural\r\nsequence it depended upon the wisdom, the moral sense and patriotism of\r\nCongress. If Congress acted right and did its duty as the mentor,\r\nguardian and trustee of the people, all would be well. But would it?\r\nWould it, indeed? The past promised nothing to the future, judging by\r\nthe light of Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s experience. But why should the Texas Pacific\r\nnot be granted aid? The public treasure had been lavished to help the\r\nCentral Pacific, a northern road\xe2\x80\x94why should the southern people not be\r\nentitled to the same privilege? These thoughts flashed through\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s mind before he answered, then he said, somewhat timidly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe plan is to establish a bank in San Diego, with Mr. George Mechlin\r\nfor President, and Don Gabriel for Cashier. The only drawback is, of\r\ncourse, the delay there might be in constructing the Texas Pacific\r\nRailroad\xe2\x80\x94the delay in the growth of San Diego. As yet, however, we are\r\nhopeful, and the prospect seems good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe prospect is perfectly good, and I would have entire confidence in\r\nit, if the fate of the railroad did not depend upon right and just\r\nlegislation. The Congressmen from the north do not seem to feel all the\r\ninterest they should in reviving the south. They are angry yet. The fact\r\nthat they coerced back into the Union the southern people has not\r\nappeased them yet, it seems. I wish Tom Scott would build his road\r\nwithout Congressional aid. The success of your banking project must, of\r\ncourse, depend upon the amount of population in San Diego.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. And if there is no railroad, there will be no population.\r\nBut Mr. Mechlin and myself are ready with our money, and with the least\r\nencouraging sign we start our bank. I think we will begin at first with\r\ntwo hundred thousand dollars. Mr. Mechlin says he can subscribe\r\ntwenty-five or thirty thousand dollars, and I will put the balance in,\r\nsubscribing thirty thousand for Don Gabriel, twenty-five thousand for\r\nVictoriano and twenty-five thousand for Everett, with ninety thousand\r\nfor myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be prudent in incurring risks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am. I have more than two hundred thousand that I can put in this bank\r\nwithout troubling my government bonds or my farm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence then explained to Don Mariano his financial affairs.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano smiled as he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea you were so well off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect to make a fortune out of my Arizona mines,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake care. Do not put any of your government bonds in them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I shall not. The interest on those bonds gives me nearly\r\nthirty-five thousand dollars per year, and this income is for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d here\r\nClarence blushed and was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo take care of your wife,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; for that alone. But do you think Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa will object to\r\nme after you explain my position?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs her only objection is that she thinks you are squatters, she would\r\nbe very unreasonable should she hold the same objections after she knows\r\nthat you are not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou make me very happy telling me that. I hope you will let me know\r\nsoon what answer she gives to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. You can come to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have some little packages that Mrs. Mechlin sends. I can bring them\r\nthis evening\xe2\x80\x94the ladies might wish to see the contents.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, they will. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be women if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwant you to relate all the incidents of the voyage, too, and the trip to\r\nthe Yosemite. If you can, come this evening. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them you are\r\ncoming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverett and Victoriano overtook them now as they entered the valley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Clary,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett called out, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you want to get out here and\r\nchange seats with Tano?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take him home,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano answered; and they all drove toward\r\nthe Darrell house.\r\n\r\nAt the door were Mr. Darrell and Alice. Immediately after, Darrell came\r\nout to greet his son. He was rather cordial to Don Mariano, and asked\r\nhim to come in and take lunch. This was so very unexpected to all his\r\nhearers, that, with the exception of Don Mariano, all showed their\r\nsurprise. This kind invitation, however, was politely declined\xe2\x80\x94whereupon\r\nVictoriano, pretending to feel slighted because he was not invited,\r\ntossed his head at Clarence and Everett, and marched majestically\r\ntowards his father\xe2\x80\x99s carriage.\r\n\r\nEverett overtook him, and would not let him get in, insisting upon his\r\nremaining to luncheon. Victoriano then indicating that he was entirely\r\npacified, remained, perfectly happy, knowing his seat would be near\r\nAlice, and that was the allurement, but he said to Tisha, as she came to\r\nset a plate for him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour cooking is so good, Tisha, that I always come sneaking around,\r\nbegging for an invitation, for I am sure you have something nice to give\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLa massa! and right welcome ye are, too, by everybody in this \xe2\x80\x99ere\r\nfamily, and I knows it exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Tisha winked to herself in the pantry, indicating to the crockery on\r\nthe shelves that she knew why Massa Tano liked her cooking, \xe2\x80\x9cand Miss\r\nAlice knows it, God bless her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tisha, nodding her head to the rows\r\nof preserves and pickle jars, in sheer exultation, for there was nothing\r\nso interesting to Tisha on the face of the earth as a love affair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_All the world love the lover_,\xe2\x80\x9d says Emerson, and Tisha could certify\r\nto this aphoristic truth, for who more humble than Tisha? And yet her\r\nheart went headlong to the lover, whoever he might be. Therefore, a love\r\naffair in the Darrell family was to Tisha perfectly entrancing. She had\r\nbeen in a state of undefined bliss ever since her perceptive organs and\r\nother means of information had indicated to her that _Clarence was in\r\nlove_! She had taken upon herself to watch and see that the affair\r\nprogressed and ended happily.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Clarence proceeded to deliver the packages sent by Elvira\r\nto her mother and sisters.\r\n\r\nWith beating heart he timidly ascended the steps of the front veranda of\r\nthe Alamar house, for he did not feel entirely certain that Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa\xe2\x80\x99s objections would be withdrawn. He was not kept in suspense\r\nabout the matter, however, as now, preceded by woolly Milord, the\r\nhandsome matron herself came forward to meet him, extending her hand in\r\nwelcome most gracious. She never had seemed to him so handsome, so\r\nregally beautiful. He thought that he had been right in imagining Juno\r\nmust have looked like her. And when she smiled, as she extended her hand\r\nto him, he thought that such was surely the smile, the manner and the\r\nbeauty of a goddess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad to welcome you, Mr. Darrell,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cand knowing that\r\nyou wish to speak to me, and as I, too, wish to speak with you alone, I\r\nthought I would meet you here by myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMilord barked, wagged his tail in token of friendship, and sat up to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said, placing the packages on a table near\r\nhim, not knowing, however, what else to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said, pushing one of the large arm-chairs for\r\nClarence to sit near. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd let me begin our conversation by apologizing\r\nfor the very wrong, very unjust opinion I have had of you. Believe me,\r\nit gives me great pleasure to know I was mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer voice, her manner, were more gracious than her words, and Clarence\r\nthought that it was not to be wondered that the daughters were so very\r\ncharming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the one who should apologize,\xe2\x80\x9d he hastened to reply; \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to\r\nhave asked Don Mariano to explain my position to you before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had, for that would have saved us many anxious thoughts. But\r\nlet us not regret the past too much, only enough to cause us to\r\nappreciate the present. I understand how you felt, not wishing to seem\r\ndisrespectful to your father, and yet not agreeing with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been the source of very painful feelings to me to see my father\r\nso misled, but I have found very great comfort in the fact that my\r\nmother agrees with me. She told me she would never come down if I did\r\nnot pay for the land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Mariano told me this, and I beg of you to convey to her my regrets\r\nat having been in error about this matter. Will you do so, please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, madam; with great pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust that her good influence will be of great assistance to you in\r\npersuading your father to change his views.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I hope so; in fact, I feel pretty sure that, more or less warmly,\r\nall of my brothers and sisters will agree with me, especially Everett\r\nand Alice. Another fact, also, is in my favor, that my father promised\r\nto Don Mariano, when he first took up the land, that he would pay for it\r\nif the Courts decided against the settlers. That promise, I think, will\r\nhave a good effect, for he always keeps his word. When the appeal is\r\ndismissed I shall remind him of it. In the meantime I shall watch my\r\nopportunities to conciliate him, for I feel sure he will resent my\r\nhaving paid for the land without his consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a pity. I am very sorry for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unpleasant that he should take so decided a view of so clear a\r\nsubject, but I feel perfectly justified in acting as I did. What I do\r\nregret sincerely is that you and\xe2\x80\x94and Miss Mercedes should not have known\r\nthe truth sooner,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, reddening to the roots of his hair,\r\nfor he felt that he was touching on most delicate ground; with anxious,\r\nbeating heart he waited for her reply.\r\n\r\nHer face flushed a little. Was it pride, or was it because the heart of\r\nwoman must always flutter when in her presence the subject of love is\r\napproached, in which ever direction it may be, and no matter if the\r\nsnows of eighty winters rest placidly on her brow? Love is woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspecial province\xe2\x80\x94she has, or has had, or will have, power there. Man\r\nmight take, and absolutely appropriate, monopolize and exclude her from\r\nmoney-making, from politics and from many other pursuits, made difficult\r\nto her by man\xe2\x80\x99s tyranny, man\xe2\x80\x99s hindrances, man\xe2\x80\x99s objections\xe2\x80\x94but in the\r\nrealms of love he is not the absolute dictator, not the master. He must\r\nsue, he must wait, he must be patient. Yes, the lord of creation often\r\nhas to take snubbing quite meekly, for he can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\r\n\r\nClarence knew all this, but he saw Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa smile, and grew brave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Mercedes, poor child, was very unhappy, and it went to my heart\r\nlike a knife to send her away, but I deemed it to be my duty\xe2\x80\x94I hoped it\r\nwould be for the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it was. You did right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but it did not enter into my calculations that you were to jump on\r\nboard the steamer,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing.\r\n\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s face and ears became crimson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have forgiven me for it,\xe2\x80\x9d he stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, still laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assure you I had no idea of doing such a thing, but when I saw her\r\ngoing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care what I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as you received some dispatches, you thought it was best to\r\ndispatch other matters as well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, after all, she left everything for _you_ to dispatch. My fate is\r\nin your hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was now Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa\xe2\x80\x99s turn to blush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that George and Mariano had decided that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. It is all left to you. Please be merciful,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded,\r\nfeeling very nervous, for he heard steps and voices approaching from\r\nthrough the hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay _yes_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, smiling, with a kind look in her beautiful eyes.\r\n\r\nHe glanced quickly toward the front door, and seeing no one in sight,\r\ndropped on his knees, and seizing her hand, covered it with hurried and\r\nvehement kisses, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks! thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd all before she knew what he was about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImpetuous boy! is that the way you rushed and assaulted my poor little\r\nMercedes?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have said yes\xe2\x80\x94God bless you for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, yes to what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! your heart will tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that? What about the heart?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Don Mariano, standing in the\r\ndoor. \xe2\x80\x9cThis looks like love-making. I am interested. Let me hear a\r\nlittle of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pulling after him a chair, to sit between\r\nClarence and his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is love-making, only it is by proxy, and I am to guess at things\r\nwithout being told,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, still laughing.\r\n\r\nClarence was greatly embarrassed. He knew he had not formally asked for\r\nthe hand of Mercedes in the serious manner that the subject merited, but\r\nhe had been carried away by his fears, then by his hopes, and the matter\r\nwas launched before he could scarcely say how. When for months past he\r\nhad thought, time and again, of a probable interview with Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa,\r\nhe had imagined himself talking to that queenly lady in his most stately\r\nSpanish. But now he had taken hold of Cervantes\xe2\x80\x99 language\xe2\x80\x94I may say,\r\njumped into it, just as he had jumped on the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s deck, thinking of\r\nno difficulties in the way, except that they must be overcome in order\r\nto reach Mercedes.\r\n\r\nHe gave a most appealing look to Don Mariano, whose kind heart\r\nimmediately responded by saying to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is love-making, and you are to guess at it, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be much\r\ndelay, for no woman was ever slow to guess such matters. I know _you_\r\nunderstood me very quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear him! but please do not learn such frightful lessons in vanity and\r\nconceit,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing again, but blushing also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know she understood what I meant, when I would ride eighty miles on\r\nhorseback for the pleasure of serenading her. To do that, or jump aboard\r\nthe steamer after it is under way, means about the same thing, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano kept talking in that strain until Clarence recovered his\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\nHe then said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been your ambassador before this queen, and her\r\nmajesty has granted your petition. So you have nothing more to do now\r\nthan to fall on your knees and kiss her hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhereupon, down went Clarence again on his knees, and seizing her hand,\r\nkissed it warmly and repeatedly, in spite of Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprotestations, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do. Once is enough\xe2\x80\x94once is enough. Reserve your kisses for\r\nyounger hands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll warrant he has plenty more in reserve,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nAnd it was true, for Clarence was so happy that he could have kissed the\r\nentire Alamar family\xe2\x80\x94all, all\xe2\x80\x94irrespective of age or sex.\r\n\r\nThe days now passed pleasantly and peacefully enough at the Alamar\r\nrancho.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano knew that he would have to go through many disagreeable\r\nscenes with the squatters when the appeal should be dismissed, but as\r\nthe law would be on his side _finally_, he confidently hoped to see the\r\nend of his troubles, intending to allow the squatters to keep their\r\nhomes, provided only that they would fence their crops and pay their own\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nClarence reconciled himself to wait until the fall to take that ring\r\nwhich Mercedes had told him to bring himself. This would be the most\r\njudicious plan, as he would thus take the necessary time to have the\r\nmines prospected and to decide about their purchase, before going to New\r\nYork. In the meanwhile he worked in the garden, fenced and prepared\r\nground for planting grapevines and fruit trees. He read and wrote love\r\nletters, and passed nearly all of his evenings at the Alamar house,\r\nholding Milord, who always came to be held by him as soon as he arrived.\r\n\r\nThe telegram from Fred Haverly came in due time, a few words only, but\r\nhow exhilarating they were to Clarence, making his pulse beat high.\r\n\r\nIt read thus:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProspect splendid. Far better than described. Have written to-day.\r\nHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLike the telegram, Fred\xe2\x80\x99s letter came promptly in the early part of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nThe ledge was so wide, Fred said, that the miners had sunk their\r\nprospect shaft in the center of the vein, and consequently all the rock\r\ntaken out was a high-grade ore. That he was going to run two drifts, and\r\nwould then have a more correct idea of the character of the mine, its\r\nvolume, formation, etc. Only a small portion of the hanging wall was\r\nvisible at the entrance, as the shaft went immediately into the very\r\nheart of the broad vein.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d Fred added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the mine proves to be one-tenth as good as it\r\nseems, \xe2\x80\x98there are millions in it,\xe2\x80\x99 literally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Clarence must make up his mind to wait developments.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the settlers had harvested their crops of hay and grain,\r\nand were hauling them to town. Don Mariano, as a matter of course, had\r\npaid dearly for these same crops, with the sacrifice of his fine cows,\r\nbesides very heavy taxes. He had sent half of his cattle away to the\r\nsierra, and those left had been as carefully guarded as possible, but\r\nstill the dumb brutes would be attracted by the green grain, and would\r\nobey the law of nature, to go and eat it, in utter disregard of the \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\nfence law.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, every night the fusilade of the law-abiding settlers would be\r\nheard, as they, to protect _their_ \xe2\x80\x9c_rights under the law_,\xe2\x80\x9d would be\r\nshooting the Don\xe2\x80\x99s cattle all over the rancho. In vain did he, or his\r\nsons and servants, ride out to find who fired. There was never a man to\r\nbe seen with a gun or rifle in his hands; it never could be proved that\r\nany one of these peaceful farmers had fired a shot. The cattle were\r\nkilled, but who had done it no one could say. Day after day the\r\n_vaqueros_ would come in and report the number of cattle found shot,\r\ndead or wounded, that morning, and Gabriel would make a note of the\r\nnumber; at the end of the month he would add these figures, and the Don\r\nhad the sad satisfaction of knowing how many of his cattle were killed\r\n_under the law_. For although the law did not enjoin upon any one to\r\nkill cattle in this manner, the effect was the same as if it had said so\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Southern California isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a very dry country as people try\r\nto make it out. The settlers on this rancho, I reckon, will realize nice\r\nlittle sums on their crops this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darrell observed at breakfast\r\none morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd with their little sums they should pay the Don for the cattle they\r\nhave shot. It is a shame to take his land, have him pay taxes, and then\r\nkill his cattle also,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mrs. Darrell. \xe2\x80\x9cThose heartless people\r\nkeep me awake sometimes with their cattle-shooting. I think the Don and\r\nhis family are too kind to bear all these daily (and nightly) outrages\r\nso patiently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you had given it up as a bad job to be the Don\xe2\x80\x99s champion,\r\nMrs. Darrell,\xe2\x80\x9d said her husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf by being his champion I could save his cattle there would be no\r\ndanger of giving up my championship. What I regret is that my sympathy\r\nshould be so useless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, mother, the Don will soon have the power to drive all this\r\n_canaille_ out of his rancho,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you include me with the _canaille_?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, father, I do not. I suppose you have not forgotten you promised Don\r\nMariano to pay for the land you located when the title should be\r\napproved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen there is no more _dispute_ about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understood you had said that when the government did not dispute it.\r\nWe all know that the squatters will dispute it as long as they can find\r\nlawyers, who for a fee will fight against right and justice,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will keep to what I said\xe2\x80\x94but I am not going to have my words\r\nconstrued to suit everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said, doggedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is the Don to have power to drive off the settlers, Clary? Tell\r\nus,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you tell him, Clary. He\xe2\x80\x99ll go and tell it to the _squatters_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nWillie interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd since when did you learn to call the settlers squatters, Master\r\nWillie? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t you a squatter yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. Am I, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Willie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not, my dear. If I thought any one in this family were to\r\ndeserve such a name I would not have come down to this place,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nDarrell replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a squatter, anyhow, mamma?\xe2\x80\x9d Clementine inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA squatter is a person who locates a land claim on land that belongs to\r\nsome other person,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn land that other persons say belongs to them, but which land, as no\r\none knows to whom it belongs, it is free to be occupied by any American\r\ncitizen,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darrell added with emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are again mixing the wilful squatter with the honest settler,\r\nwho pre-empts his land legitimately. The dividing line between the\r\nsquatter and the settler is very clear to any one who honestly wants to\r\nsee it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell said, and three or four of her children started to\r\nexplain how well they did see that line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is as plain as the nose on your face,\xe2\x80\x9d Willie\xe2\x80\x99s voice said in a high\r\nkey. \xe2\x80\x9cThe honest settler only pre-empts government land, but the\r\nsquatter goes into anybody\xe2\x80\x99s land before he knows who has title.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Everett; \xe2\x80\x9cyou got it straight this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen a squatter is a land thief?\xe2\x80\x9d Clementine inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a severe term,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true?\xe2\x80\x9d Clementine argued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because the squatter might not _intend_ to steal. He might\r\nmistakenly take land which belongs to some one else. The intention is\r\nwhat makes the action a theft or not,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should they make such mistakes? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t somebody there to say to\r\nwhom the land belongs?\xe2\x80\x9d Master Willie inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but that somebody might not be believed, Master Willie, and there\r\nis where the shoe pinches,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d was Willie\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation, and he became thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI give it up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clementine with a sigh, making them all laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a very wise resolve,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it, papa,\xe2\x80\x9d Willie\xe2\x80\x99s voice again was heard saying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what have you got?\xe2\x80\x9d his father asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe government ought to say first to whom the land belongs, and not let\r\nanybody take a single acre until the government says it is public land.\r\nIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that the way you say, Clarence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you are quoting Clarence. I thought it was your own original idea\r\nyou were giving us,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said, and all laughed at Willie.\r\n\r\nBut he held his ground, saying; \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s idea, but I only\r\nunderstood it this minute, so now it is mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right, Willie. That is the way correct ideas are disseminated\r\nand take root,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd erroneous ones, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the correct, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Willie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mind is even more inquisitive than usual this morning, Willie,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Jane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose it is, do you object to it?\xe2\x80\x9d Willie queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better be a lawyer,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean to be. Then I will be the Don\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose he don\xe2\x80\x99t want you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Webster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will, for I will be honest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill he want you if you are stupid, only because you are honest?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nClementine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hate girls, they talk so silly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willie, again bringing the\r\nlaugh on himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\xe2\x80\x94_At Newport._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. George Mechlin and traveling companions had a most delightful\r\njourney across the continent in spite of the hot weather.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence Mechlin and wife came to New York to meet George\xe2\x80\x99s bride\r\nand her sister and take them to Long Branch, where they had been\r\nsojourning for the last two months.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lawrence Mechlin was most favorably impressed with her nephew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife and her sister. The two young beauties captivated her at once. She\r\nwas enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said she after dinner, addressing Elvira, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I saw you\r\nand your sister I had been deliberating in my mind whether we should not\r\ngo directly to our cottage in Newport and spend the remainder of the\r\nsummer there. But now I think we had better go to Long Branch first, and\r\nthen, unless you wish to visit Saratoga, we will go to Newport. How will\r\nthat do?\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at George.\r\n\r\nGeorge smiled. He knew his aunt must be much pleased to put herself to\r\nthe trouble of this traveling in hot weather. He replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure these young ladies will be most happy to follow you, aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you all get too tired. And this reminds me that people who have\r\nbeen in the cars for ten days should have some rest. The day will be\r\ncool to-morrow; we need not go back to Long Branch until the day after,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid the senior Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not intend going to-morrow. We have something to do in town yet,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mrs. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome shopping, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lawrence observed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife assented.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Mechlin accompanied Elvira and Mercedes to their respective\r\napartments, she returned to the library, where her husband and nephew\r\nwere engaged in conversation. There was in Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s step and\r\nmanner a degree of pleased elasticity, an amiable buoyancy of contented\r\nalacrity, which betokened that her mind was in a state of subdued\r\npleasurable excitement which was to her very enjoyable. She came to\r\nGeorge and kissed him twice, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must repeat my kiss and congratulations, dear George. Your wife is\r\nperfection. Where in the world did such beauties grow? I assure you I am\r\nperfectly carried away by those two girls. No wonder you were so\r\nimpatient to get married. They will be the rage next winter, and I shall\r\ngive several dinners and receptions in honor of your wife, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are always so kind to me, dear aunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo more than I ought to be, but this time pleasure and duty will go\r\ntogether. I know I shall be proud to present my beautiful niece to New\r\nYork society. Her manners are exquisite. She is lovely. She will be\r\ngreatly admired, and justly so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to arrange for your parties and dinners to be in December\r\nand February, because George is going to Washington in January, and the\r\nyoung ladies will take that opportunity to visit the Capital with him,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Mechlin, senior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a pity. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they go in December?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because George\xe2\x80\x99s business is with the Attorney General, and he\r\nwrote to me that he would not be ready until January. However, January\r\nis six months off yet. For the present, you have enough on your hands\r\nwith your plans for the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very true. We will order some summer things to be made\r\nimmediately. But I feel quite sure that we can find imported dresses\r\nready made that will suit. I saw some lovely batists and grenadines at\r\nArnold & Constable\xe2\x80\x99s, just from Paris, also beautiful embroidered\r\nmuslins at Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s. We will see to-morrow and be ready to return the\r\nday after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLife at Long Branch in the Mechlin cottage was very delightful to Elvira\r\nand Mercedes. When they had been there about two weeks, Mr. Robert\r\nGunther appeared on the scene, and next day Mr. Arthur Selden followed.\r\nAs they were old friends of the Mechlins, Mrs. Mechlin thought it was a\r\nnatural thing that these two young gentlemen, on their return from their\r\ntravels, should come to see her at Long Branch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a day or two we are going to Newport, young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better join our party and we\xe2\x80\x99ll all go together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be most happy. My mother and sister have been with friends in\r\nthe White Mountains, but will be at Newport next week, so this\r\narrangement will suit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gunther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will suit me, also, as I promised my mother and sisters I should be\r\nat Newport in two weeks. Saratoga is too hot for me. I left them there\r\nunder father\xe2\x80\x99s care. He likes Saratoga,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Selden said.\r\n\r\nIf their sojourn at Long Branch had seemed so delightful to Elvira and\r\nMercedes, their pleasures increased ten-fold at Newport. The Mechlin\r\nvilla, shaded by tall elms and poplars, and surrounded by shrubbery and\r\nflowers, with a beautiful lawn and fountains in front, facing the ocean,\r\nand well-kept walks and arbors in different places on the grounds, was\r\ncertainly a charming abode, fit to please the most fastidious taste.\r\nThen the drives, croquet playing, boat sailing and promenades, were also\r\nmuch enjoyed by our two little Californians. In the evenings, music and\r\ndancing would add variety to their pleasures, until such life seemed to\r\nthem too charming to be real.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is this life repeated every summer, year after year?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nMercedes one evening as in the coming twilight she was sitting with Mr.\r\nBob Gunther in a cozy bower of roses located on a little knoll in the\r\ngrounds of the Gunther villa. They were looking at the gay equipages\r\nwhich drove by. Gunther sighed as he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you like this life?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much, but perhaps because it is a novelty to me. However, I am\r\nnever tired of things that I once like, so I suppose I would like it\r\nalways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not look at Gunther; her attention was all given to the\r\nbeautiful carriages driving by. If she had looked at him she would have\r\nseen the intensity of his passion in the workings of his features. For a\r\nmoment the struggle with himself was terrible; but controlling his voice\r\nall he could, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have this life if you wish, and continue in the winters in a\r\nbeautiful residence in New York or in Paris, should you desire it. You\r\nknow it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I do not. I have no fairy god-mother to give me palaces. Come, let\r\nus go. Where is everybody?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, hurrying out of the arbor, looking\r\nabout the grounds for Elvira and Miss Gunther, who had but a moment\r\nbefore been near her. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! there they are; let us go to them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I frighten you? or am I tiresome?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pale to the lips,\r\nfollowing her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither; but young ladies who\xe2\x80\x94who are\xe2\x80\x94I mean any young lady, should not\r\nhave such _tete-\xc3\xa1-tetes_ with fascinating young gentlemen in rosy\r\nbowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung ladies who are\xe2\x80\x94what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are judicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you not going to say \xe2\x80\x98who are engaged?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had, I might not have said the truth, _strictly_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, tell me the truth! Are you engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk me no questions, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee no lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are cruel; you are trifling with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stopped and looked up quickly into his eyes. For a moment she\r\nhesitated, then resolutely said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gunther, I like you very much. Don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to me like this. I want\r\nto find pleasure in your society, but I shall not if you talk so to me.\r\nI am not and have never been cruel, and it never entered my head to\r\ntrifle with you\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me this time. I shall never offend again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked so distressed that Mercedes felt very sorry for him. She would\r\nhave comforted him if she could. They walked in silence a few steps, but\r\nas he still looked pale, she did not wish the other ladies to see him.\r\nThey were walking towards the house. Pointing to a narrow path leading\r\ntowards the seashore, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat path goes to your boat-house, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I have a new boat; would you like to see it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it far? You see it is getting late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can come back in ten minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly? No longer than ten minutes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a second longer unless you wish it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, turning quickly into the little path, and he followed\r\nher. She did not care a straw to see the boat, but she wanted to give\r\nhim time to get back the color to his face. She walked so fast down the\r\nhill; she almost ran. She looked back; he was following close. She began\r\nto laugh and started to run. He ran after her, and they did not stop\r\nuntil they got to the beach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long is it since we started?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. He looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot quite two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon for running, obliging you to run, but I felt like it\r\nwhen I saw the blue water. It reminded me of home, of San Diego.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo apology is needed. If it gave you pleasure to run, I am glad you did\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne look only, and then we must go back. Perhaps we had better return;\r\nI hear horses coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and at the same time Mr. Selden and his\r\nyoungest sister came down by the boat-house at a gallop. His face\r\nflushed and became pale, but he lifted his hat as he passed. Gunther did\r\nthe same, in answer to Miss Selden\xe2\x80\x99s salutation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us return. More riders might be passing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, and began\r\nto walk back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! without seeing the boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be dark inside the house. I\xe2\x80\x99ll come some other time, earlier.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you promise me that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. You see, we can\xe2\x80\x99t run as fast up hill; it will take more\r\nthan two minutes to return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain the galloping of horses was heard, and Selden, with his sister,\r\npassed on their way back just as Mercedes and Gunther reached the bank\r\nat the edge of the lawn and sat down to rest.\r\n\r\nSelden\xe2\x80\x99s sister had noticed how he flushed and how livid he became a\r\nminute after, and faithfully reported the fact to her vigilant mamma as\r\nsoon as she got home. Arthur would be watched now. His mamma knew that\r\nhe was a millionaire and considered \xe2\x80\x9ca catch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Seldens had been abroad many years, the greater time in England, and\r\nhad acquired some English habits, one of which was to dine late. That\r\nevening Arthur did not come down to dinner until half-past eight\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. He was afraid he would be questioned regarding the young lady\r\nwith Robert Gunther. He felt too angry with his friend to hear his name\r\nspoken. But it was unavoidable. As soon as he took his seat at the table\r\nhis mother asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was the lady with Robert on the beach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening as we rode by his boat-house,\xe2\x80\x9d explained his sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere they coming out of the boat-house?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the elder sister.\r\nArthur\xe2\x80\x99s lips became white again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed. They did not go into the boat-house,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nsneeringly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? I alarmed? It seems to me you are the one alarmed. I might say\r\nfrightened,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, reddening like a peony, trembling with anger,\r\nas she well understood her brother meant to allude to her well known\r\nfondness for Bob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is the lady, any way? I ask,\xe2\x80\x9d reiterated Mrs. Selden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is George Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s sister-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d Arthur replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! That is the beauty I hear half a dozen fellows are raving about,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Miss Selden, to pique her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she so very pretty, Arthur?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the younger sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw any woman so beautiful in all my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with\r\ndogged resolution as if about to pull the string of his shower bath.\r\n\r\nThe mother and daughters exchanged looks. They understood it all now.\r\nPoor Arthur, he, too, was raving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy-the-by, I met Mechlin in the street to-day, and he asked if any one\r\nwas sick in our family,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Selden, senior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand. We will call to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Selden said, sententiously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see the beauties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd they did. When they were in their carriage riding home, Mrs. Selden\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry for Arthur if he is in love with that girl. I fear he will\r\nnever get over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better if he marries her,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but if he does not, he\xe2\x80\x99ll never have any heart left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose she would refuse him?\xe2\x80\x9d said the elder sister, haughtily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I must have a talk with Arthur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had a talk with Arthur, and when he saw evasion would be useless, he\r\ntold her all about his love and why he believed it hopeless, judging by\r\nwhat he heard George say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if she is not positively engaged to that Darrell, why should you\r\nfear him more than you fear Gunther?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I believe she loves him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps. But we are not sure of it. Moreover, he is far off in\r\nCalifornia, and you are here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArthur shook his head despondingly, but, nevertheless, he was pleased to\r\nhear his mother say that they must entertain those two Californians, and\r\nMrs. Mechlin would think it was all intended as a compliment to herself.\r\n\r\nThe Gunthers being more intimate with the Mechlins, should not be\r\noutdone by the Seldens in courtesy to these two ladies (at least such\r\nwas the opinion expressed by Robert to his mother), and thus a day\r\nhardly passed without some entertainment for their amusement.\r\n\r\nArthur closed his eyes to the future and let himself float down this\r\nstream of sweet pleasures, knowing that they were but a dream, and yet\r\nfor that reason more determined to drink the last drop of that nectar so\r\nintoxicating, and enjoy being near her, within the sound of her voice,\r\nwithin the magic circle of her personality. The thought that he had seen\r\nher with Gunther rambling on the beach had been at first very bitter and\r\ndisconcerting, but when he had learned that she had intended going to\r\nsee the boat, but changed her mind, he consoled himself, and more easily\r\nyet, when he observed that Gunther and other admirers made no more\r\nprogress as suitors than he did himself.\r\n\r\nMisery loves company, sure. Thus it will be seen that Mr. Arthur Selden\r\ndid not deceive himself with any very great hopes of success; still,\r\nsuch is the complexity of man\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations and man\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, that he\r\ndetermined to speak to Mercedes of his love, for he had never done\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94had never offered himself to her. He would know the worst from her\r\nown lips. So one morning in the month of September, when George Mechlin\r\nand his uncle had gone to New York on business on account of Jay Cook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfailure, Selden saw the two Misses Mechlin out driving on the road\r\ntowards Fort Adams. He concluded that the two Misses Mechlin must be\r\ngoing to call on the officers\xe2\x80\x99 wives, stationed at the Fort, and\r\nMercedes must be alone at home. He immediately took a side road thus to\r\navoid meeting the Mechlins and drove directly to the Mechlin villa. He\r\nfound Mercedes alone in the library, where she had gone for a book to\r\ntake to her room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Arthur Selden,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall servant at the library door, and\r\nbehind his broad shoulders peeped Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s red whiskers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI took the liberty of following the servant,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I hoped\r\nwe would be less interrupted here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied she, laughing and offering him a chair; \xe2\x80\x9cvery\r\nlogical deduction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t laugh at me, please,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, blushing; \xe2\x80\x9cI know you are thinking\r\nthat others might follow you here as well as I, and it is so, but you\r\nsee, Miss Mercedes, I am in despair at times. I have been wishing to\r\nspeak to you alone, but I never have a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Selden, you see me very often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but not alone, not where I could tell you all I feel for you, and\r\nbeg you not to drive me to despair. You know I have loved you from the\r\nfirst instant I saw you. Can I hope ever to win your love? May I hope,\r\nor is my love hopeless?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Selden, I like you very much, but please do not ask me to love you.\r\nIt is not possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Is it because I am not handsome like Bob Gunther?\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nwith a painful sneer. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, I shall be a devoted, loving husband;\r\nnone can love you more passionately and devotedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not doubt it. But I cannot. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me, and don\xe2\x80\x99t hate\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Robert Gunther,\xe2\x80\x9d said the tall waiter, and Bob\xe2\x80\x99s broad brow and\r\ngood-natured smile shone at the door.\r\n\r\nThe delightful sojourn at Newport was now over. The Mechlin family were\r\nagain at their town residence in New York City. Elvira and Mercedes, as\r\nit was their habit, were that evening having their cosy chat before\r\ngoing to bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Clarence will be here next month,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he says he will spend Christmas with us, and if we\xe2\x80\x99ll let him, he\r\nwill go with us to Washington.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be delightful. I suppose Gunther and your other numerous\r\nslaves will disappear when he arrives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey ought not, for I have never encouraged any one any more than if I\r\nhad been married already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not, my darling, and that makes a very great difference\r\nwith young gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that Mrs. Mechlin does not approve of my being engaged to\r\nClarence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause she had set her heart upon your marrying Gunther, who is a\r\ngreat favorite of hers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to disappoint her, for she has been so sweet and good to me,\r\nbut I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. Here are the letters I got from home. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave\r\nthem for you to read, and you let me have yours. I hear George coming up\r\nstairs, I must go to my room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, pussy, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you had a nice frolic at Newport?\xe2\x80\x9d said George,\r\nstopping Mercedes at the door and making her come back into the room\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I have,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd haven\xe2\x80\x99t you broken hearts as if they were old cracked pottery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must have been, to be broken so easily. But I guess I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt\r\nany very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed you did. Besides Gunther and Selden who are given up as\r\nincurable, there are three or four others very badly winged. Poor\r\nfellows, and friends of mine, too. It is like an epidemic, uncle says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence will soon be here and stop the epidemic from spreading any\r\nfurther,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that. But I am glad he is coming. When will he be\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout Christmas\xe2\x80\x94perhaps about the twentieth of December,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes\r\nanswered. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says he will telegraph to you the day he starts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be glad to see him; he is a noble fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and\r\nembraced Mercedes, saying good night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\xe2\x80\x94_In New York._\r\n\r\n\r\nCards for Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s ball, on the 27th of December, had been out for\r\ntwo or three days, when, on the 20th of that same month and\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x941873\xe2\x80\x94Clarence arrived at the American metropolis. He was in a high\r\nstate of excitement. He could scarcely repress his impatience to see\r\nMercedes, and yet he exerted sufficient self-control to go first to\r\nTiffany and purchase the finest diamond ring in the establishment. He\r\neven was patient enough to wait until the diamond which he selected was\r\nreset in a ring from which an emerald was removed. When the exchange was\r\nmade and the jewel paid for, he told the driver to hasten to Mr.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nGeorge and his uncle had just come from their office when Clarence\r\narrived, so he met them in the hall as he entered. George presented him\r\nto his uncle, and the three walked into the library. The cordial manner\r\nin which Clarence was received by Mr. Mechlin, demonstrated clearly how\r\nfavorably this gentleman was impressed.\r\n\r\nAfter conversing with him, while George went to carry the news of his\r\narrival up-stairs, Mr. Mechlin, when George returned, invited him to\r\ndine with them, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if you were not quite a stranger to us, having heard George\r\nspeak of you so often, and always most kindly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence hesitated, but George insisted, and he remained. Then the two\r\nfriends sat down to chat while the ladies came down. In a few minutes\r\nClarence had given a synopsis of home news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what about mining news?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid,\xe2\x80\x9d was the reply.\r\n\r\nAnd Clarence quickly told him how rich his mines had turned out, and how\r\nhe had already sold six hundred thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of ore, and had\r\nan offer of one million dollars for the mines, but the Haverly brothers\r\nadvised him not to sell. That he thought of putting up crushing mills in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin went into his wife\xe2\x80\x99s room without knocking\xe2\x80\x94an omission\r\nindicative of great pre-occupation of mind\xe2\x80\x94and his words proved that to\r\nbe the case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that young fellow is splendid, wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat young fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat young Darrell, from California.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! where did you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown stairs. He is talking with George in the library, and I asked him\r\nto take dinner with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe might be splendid\xe2\x80\x94but never superior to Bob Gunther\xe2\x80\x94never!\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMrs. Mechlin, with firmness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not superior, mentally or morally, but he is certainly much\r\nhandsomer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsomer than Bob? The idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou wait until you see him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin, going into his room to\r\nget ready for dinner.\r\n\r\nIf Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 hands had not trembled so much she would have been ready to\r\ncome down stairs much sooner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had accepted aunt\xe2\x80\x99s offer to get you a maid you would not labor\r\nunder so many difficulties,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, coming into Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 room as\r\nshe was going down stairs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have never dressed yourself without some\r\none to help you at home, whether it was my squaw, your squaw, or\r\nmamma\xe2\x80\x99s, or the other girls, or whether it was your own Madame\r\nHalier\xe2\x80\x94you always had an attendant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes said, ready to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so utterly useless\r\nwhen\xe2\x80\x94when\xe2\x80\x94sometimes\xe2\x80\x94but how could I accept a maid? It would have been an\r\nextravagance after the many dresses and other things bought for me. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had thought of sending my maid to help you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira,\r\ncoming to Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 assistance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish so, too, now; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I wanted her, as Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmaid had dressed my hair. What I dread is that your aunt will be present\r\nwhen I meet him, and\xe2\x80\x94and as she don\xe2\x80\x99t like him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. She likes Bob Gunther, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But she will not go down\r\nbefore we do if she knows Clarence is here. She will give you time to\r\nmeet him first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s assistance Mercedes at last was ready, and with trembling\r\nknees, which scarcely supported her light weight, she managed to walk\r\ndown stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t run so fast, dear. I want you by me,\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my arm, old lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe rustle of silk approaching put Clarence in a tremor\xe2\x80\x94making him\r\nforget what he was saying.\r\n\r\nElvira entered, and he rose to meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must salute you Spanish fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, embracing him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is pussy?\xe2\x80\x9d said George, going towards the door, but as the train\r\nof Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s dress lay in his way, he looked down and pushed it aside.\r\n\r\nMercedes, who had remained behind the door, saw him do so, and burst out\r\nlaughing, for it seemed to her as if George was expecting to find pussy\r\nentangled in Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere she is, laughing at me,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, taking her arm.\r\n\r\nShe looked so lovely, that Clarence stood looking at her in silence, not\r\neven taking a step to meet her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell, I am very glad to see you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, still laughing, all\r\nher fear and trembling having left her. She extended her hand to him\r\nwith perfect composure.\r\n\r\nElvira looked at her surprised. She herself was surprised at her sudden\r\nand perfect calmness. Because George made her laugh looking for _pussy_\r\nin Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s train, she lost all her fear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a step from the sublime to the ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to\r\nherself, as she became of a sudden philosophically calm.\r\n\r\nWhen she explained what had made her laugh, all joined her, remembering\r\nthat it had indeed seemed as if George was looking for some small object\r\nhidden in the ruffles of Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s train.\r\n\r\nThose rosy lips and pearly teeth looked so sweet, and the little dimples\r\nso charming when she laughed, that Clarence would have been satisfied to\r\nremain there looking at them for an indefinite length of time without\r\nsaying anything, only holding her hand in his, and looking into her\r\neyes. But other people were not so entranced, and as now Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMechlin came in, all proceeded to the dining-room, after George had\r\npresented him to his aunt.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mechlin was a little cold in her manner at first, thinking that\r\nsurely Bob must give up all hopes. But being a very courteous hostess,\r\nher manner soon became affable, she engaged Clarence in conversation,\r\nasking him about fruit-raising in California, and about those\r\nwonderfully rich mines, which had given so many millions to the world.\r\nMr. Mechlin also became much interested in what Clarence had to say.\r\nBefore dinner was over, Mercedes had the pleasure of seeing that Mr. and\r\nMrs. Mechlin were more than favorably impressed with her intended.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner many callers began to arrive. Clarence had not spoken a\r\nword yet to Mercedes alone. He followed her with his eyes and\r\nwatched\xe2\x80\x94without seeming too watchful\xe2\x80\x94for an opportunity of speaking to\r\nher without being overheard.\r\n\r\nAt last the desired moment came, and he was able to whisper a few words.\r\n\r\nShe blushed as she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps not this evening\xe2\x80\x94there are so many\r\nhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI brought you the ring which you told me I was not to send but _bring_\r\nin person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring it to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with deeper blush.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt what time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps between ten and eleven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence returned to Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s side, and had to console himself with\r\nstudying how Mercedes could have become more beautiful when it had\r\nseemed that it would be impossible for any human being to be more\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nHe was deliciously occupied in pondering upon this problem when ices and\r\ncakes, tea and coffee were served by two waiters, in white gloves, and\r\nvery irreproachable manners, and now Clarence could have the happiness\r\nof taking his ice cream beside Mercedes.\r\n\r\nNext day, at half-past ten exactly, Clarence ran up the steps of the\r\nMechlin mansion. He gave his card to the servant for Miss Alamar, and\r\nasked for no one else, but Elvira came from the library as she heard his\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAunt and myself are going to attend to some shopping. You will stay to\r\nluncheon, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Aunt requests it. I am glad she likes you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am truly grateful to her, and much pleased, indeed. But I shall be\r\nmaking a very long call if I wait. I shall go and return at one\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\nbetter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have anything else to do this morning, of course, go and return.\r\nWe lunch at one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing on earth to do but to see you people and wait on you. I\r\nhope you won\xe2\x80\x99t get tired of me. I was in hopes you two would go with me\r\nto see some very pretty things at Tiffany\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going there now. I promised aunt to go with her. Mercedes and I,\r\nyou mean, I suppose, can go with you to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Mechlin now came down stairs, and Clarence waited on them to their\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nAs he closed the carriage door Mrs. Mechlin said: \xe2\x80\x9cElvira has told you\r\nwe shall expect you to luncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam; thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, bowing.\r\n\r\nThe carriage drove off, and Mrs. Mechlin said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is certainly very\r\nhandsome. I am sorry for Bob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Clarence returned he met Mercedes in the hall. She was evidently\r\nfrightened, and so was he, but soon rallied as he followed her into the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me more about home, now that we are alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pushing a\r\nchair for him, and occupying another on the opposite side of the\r\nfire-place, with a graceful affability, which reminded him of his\r\ninterview with Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa on the veranda at the rancho.\r\n\r\nHe understood by her manner and the position of the chairs, which had\r\nhigh backs and high arms, that the interview was to be very formal, and\r\nso he took his seat accordingly\xe2\x80\x94far off and demurely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere shall I begin?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with mock gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere\xe2\x80\x94at the top with papa, or at the bottom with Tisha. It will all\r\nbe interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t I begin at the middle, for instance, with myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but you are here\xe2\x80\x94I see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you? At this distance? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you want a telescope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are near enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t talk of anybody but you. What is the use of putting me in this\r\nchair like a bad child that must be punished by being roasted alive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you too near the fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd too far from you,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising, and going to sit on a sofa, at\r\nthe other end of the room. She kept her seat by the fire-place. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease\r\ncome here. I have so much to say to you. It will give me a headache to\r\nsit so near the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe arose, walked over to where he was, and sat on another arm-chair\r\nnearest to the sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us freeze at this end of the room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you cold? If you are, let us go back to the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did look a little cold, with her pretty little hands calmly folded\r\non her lap, but she smiled.\r\n\r\nHe drew a low seat close to hers, and took the soft hands into his,\r\nsaying in beseeching accents:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me sit by you, please. After so many weary months of absence grant\r\nme this happiness. You told me not to send but _bring_ our engagement\r\nring. Here it is. Let me put it on the dear little finger myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying he put the ring on, and covered the hand with kisses.\r\nMercedes\xe2\x80\x99 face was suffused with blushes, and she did not dare look at\r\nthe ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been longing for this moment of bliss, Mercedes, my own, my\r\nprecious. You are pledged to me now. Look at me, my sweet wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a foolish boy!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, covering her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you must set the day of our marriage. Let it be the day after we\r\narrive. Let us be married at San Francisco. Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must ask mamma and papa. Talk to Elvira about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will. She will not object. Particularly as Mechlin intends going to\r\nreside in California, and engaging in business there. So you see, it\r\nwill be just the thing for our marriage to take place as soon as we\r\narrive. I think it would be so nice for all your family, and my mother\r\nand Alice and Everett to come to meet us at San Francisco, and we be\r\nmarried there, and I then take you to your house, which will be ready\r\nfor you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether mamma would approve\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my precious! Why not? She will, if you say you wish it so. I will\r\nwrite to-day to Hubert. I shall telegraph him to buy the handsome house\r\nhe told me was for sale. Shall I telegraph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down reflectingly. Suddenly she uttered an exclamation of\r\nsurprise. She had seen the ring for the first time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had not seen this diamond. Is it not too magnificent for an\r\nengagement ring?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is too magnificent for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, really, will it not attract too much attention?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think not. You are not ashamed of it, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. Only it might be considered too large for an engagement\r\nring,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. But observing that he looked pained, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nvery beautiful. It is like a big drop of sunlight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you like it. But perhaps it might not be considered in good\r\ntaste for an engagement ring. Let us go to Tiffany\xe2\x80\x99s now and ask your\r\nsister. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you all home news as we drive down. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremove the ring. I am superstitious about that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes laughed and arose, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI will not touch it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go now to\r\nput on my bonnet. Elvira told me I may drive down with you to Tiffany\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nif I wished. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be gone but two minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen am I going to have one sweet kiss?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, in pleading tones.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, running off, eluding him.\r\n\r\nThe gentle motion of Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s luxuriantly cushioned carriage\r\ninvited conversation, and Elvira soon perceived that her aunt desired to\r\nknow all about Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s family and history and wished to obtain all\r\nnecessary information in that respect as they drove down Broadway to\r\nTiffany\xe2\x80\x99s, Elvira therefore proceeded to enlighten the good lady,\r\nremembering, however, that George had cautioned her never to mention\r\nthat old Darrell had taken land on the rancho in the sincere conviction\r\nthat by wise enactments of Congress, to rob people of their lands, was\r\nand had been made a most honest transaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy aunt will not understand,\xe2\x80\x9d George had said, \xe2\x80\x9cand never realize the\r\neffect that our legislation has upon us, as a nation, particularly upon\r\nthe untraveled, the stay-at-home Americans, and more specially yet, the\r\nfarmers. She will not believe old Darrell honest in his error, and no\r\nmatter whether Clarence might be the prince of good fellows, to her he\r\nwill always be the son of a squatter, of one who _steals land_. No\r\nmatter under whose sanction\xe2\x80\x94theft is theft to her\xe2\x80\x94and she would snap her\r\nfingers at the entire Senate and House of Representatives, if those\r\nhonorable bodies undertook to prove to her that by getting together and\r\nsaying that they can authorize American citizens to go and take the\r\nproperty of other citizens (without paying for it) and keep it\xe2\x80\x94and fight\r\nfor it to keep it\xe2\x80\x94that the proceeding is made honorable and lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRemembering these words of George, Elvira spoke highly of Mrs. Darrell\r\nand the other members of the family, but said very little of the head\r\nthereof. Still, as there was much to say about Clarence himself, very\r\nfavorable to that young gentleman, the time was agreeably occupied with\r\nhis biography, while the two ladies drove through Broadway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed last evening that his manners are very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nLawrence Mechlin, speaking of Clarence. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, my dear, that I have\r\na confirmed dread of bad-mannered people. They spread discord and\r\ndiscomfort wherever they are. And _apropos_ of manners, I must not omit\r\nsaying that Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 behavior last evening was all that could be\r\ndesired in a well-bred young lady. A great many quite nice young ladies\r\non such an occasion would have gone into the library, or the little\r\nboudoir, or the other parlors, or would have sat on the stairs,\r\nanywhere, to have a whispered _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with her _fianc\xc3\xa9_. Your\r\nsister remained in the drawing-room, like a lady, though I know well\r\nenough her heart was longing to express how glad she was to see him. And\r\nhe, too, behaved very well. Did not hang about her, but was courteous to\r\nall the ladies. I noticed last summer that Mercedes was not fond of\r\nrunning off to have a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_ with this one, and then with\r\nanother, as many of our girls do, but I thought she avoided it on\r\naccount of being engaged. Now, however, I see that her reason is even a\r\nbetter one. That it is inbred self-respect, a lady\xe2\x80\x99s sense of decorum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you think so well of my sister, dear aunt; and I think she is\r\nnaturally refined and lady-like. But as for running off to have\r\n_t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaates_ with gentlemen is a thing never seen among our Spanish\r\ngirls. I know that we, Spanish people, are criticised and much ridiculed\r\nfor keeping girls too strictly guarded, and in some instances this may\r\nbe so, but as a general thing, the girls themselves like to be guarded.\r\nWe have all the freedom that is good for us. Now, for instance, I told\r\nMercedes she may receive Clarence alone, and after they had their talk\r\ntogether, that she might drive down and join us here. I know I can trust\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right. I am glad you told her to come, for I want to give her a\r\nChristmas present, and would like to have some idea of her taste in\r\njewelry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn due time the two ladies arrived at the jeweler\xe2\x80\x99s, and very soon after\r\nMercedes and Clarence joined them. The ring was submitted to Mrs.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s _dictum_, and she pronounced it superb, not at all\r\ninappropriate for an engagement ring. Meantime, however, Clarence had\r\nseen another which he liked best, and he bought it at once. It was made\r\nof large diamonds, set in a circle, close together, so that the ring\r\nlooked like a band of light, very beautiful, \xe2\x80\x9cand,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cjust the\r\nthing; in fact, symbolical,\xe2\x80\x9d considering that he wished to surround\r\nMercedes with never-ending brightness and joy.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas night our Californians attended a _musicale_ at Mrs.\r\nGunther\xe2\x80\x99s. On the 27th, Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s grand ball came off (and a grand\r\naffair it was). On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day George took Clarence on an extensive\r\ntour of visiting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will have a regular \xe2\x80\x98_rodeo_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said George, laughing, as they were\r\nabout to start; \xe2\x80\x9cand wind up our drive by coming home to make a long\r\nvisit here, at our _corral_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want you, if you call your round of visits a \xe2\x80\x98_rodeo_.\xe2\x80\x99 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou ashamed to laugh at us Californians like that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira,\r\naffecting great resentment, which took several kisses from George to\r\npacify.\r\n\r\nClarence was so pleased with the number and character of the\r\nacquaintances he made on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s, and he was so warmly invited to\r\ncall again, that he became convinced that New York was just the nicest\r\ncity on the continent, and even thought he would like it for a\r\nresidence, provided Mercedes was of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nThe Mechlins received in grand style on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s, and finished the day\r\nwith a dance and collation.\r\n\r\nNext night Mrs. Gunther\xe2\x80\x99s ball took place, which was followed by an\r\nequally grand affair at the Seldens, on the 6th.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was time to talk about the trip to Washington. George wanted\r\nhis uncle and aunt to go with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no fears that the Solicitor General will give us any trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. L. Mechlin; \xe2\x80\x9cI think his action in the Alamar case was a\r\n_feeler_ only for some ulterior purpose, which he has abandoned. But if\r\nI could see how I might help Scott with his Texas Pacific Railroad, I\r\nshould be most happy to go and try\xe2\x80\x94for his sake, for the sake of the\r\nsouthern people, and for the sake of you people at San Diego. But I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see what I can do now. The failure of Jay Cook has hurt Scott at\r\nthe very time when Huntington is getting stronger and his influence in\r\nCongress evidently increasing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeveral persons have told me that a certain railroad man is bribing\r\nCongressmen right and left to defeat the Texas Pacific Railroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGeorge, \xe2\x80\x9cand I believe it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBribery is an ugly word,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin replied; \xe2\x80\x9cand if that is the way\r\nrailroad men are going to work, it will be a difficult matter for an\r\nhonest man to compete with them and keep his hands clean. However, I\r\nmight be able to help Scott in some way. I guess we might go for a week\r\nor two. Lizzie, what do you think? Would you like to go to Washington\r\nfor a week or two?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would like it very well. I shall miss these two young ladies very\r\nmuch, and as the best way to cure _ennui_ is to avoid it, I think a\r\nvisit to Washington would be just the thing for me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes clapped her hands in such genuine delight at hearing this, and\r\nElvira and Clarence were evidently so pleased, that Mrs. Mechlin added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese dear children seem so pleased that now I would feel great\r\nsatisfaction in going, even if I did not expect any pleasure in my\r\nvisit. But I do. I have not been in Washington for years, and I have\r\nmany warm friends there whom I would like to see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus it was fixed that all the family would go to Washington on the 9th\r\nor 10th, and remain for two or three weeks at the gay capital.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mechlin now remembered that the Gunthers and the Seldens had\r\nmentioned that perhaps they would accept some invitations to several\r\nparties and a wedding, to come off in Washington about the middle of\r\nJanuary, and would be going down about the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll get a special car,\r\nand you invite the Gunthers and Seldens to go with us, and we will make\r\na pleasant party all together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a good idea. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see Mrs. Gunther to-day, and we will appoint\r\nthe day to start.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thus it came to pass that on the 9th of January our Californians\r\nwere traveling in a palace car on their way to Washington, in company\r\nwith the most elite of New York.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Bob Gunther and Arthur Selden were of the party. They derived no\r\npleasure in being so, but they followed Mercedes because they preferred\r\nthe bitter sweet of being near her, in her presence, rather than to\r\naccept at once the bitter alone of a hopeless separation. They knew they\r\nmust not hope, but still they hoped, for the reason alone that hope goes\r\nwith man to the foot of the gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\xe2\x80\x94_At the Capitol._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no greater monster in being than a very ill man of great\r\nparts, he lives like a man in a palsy, with one side of him dead; while\r\nperhaps he enjoys the satisfaction of luxury, of wealth, of ambition, he\r\nhas lost all the taste of good-will, of friendship, of innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d says\r\nAddison.\r\n\r\nIf this can be said of a man whose influence is of limited scope, how\r\nmuch more horrible the \xe2\x80\x9cpalsy,\xe2\x80\x9d the moral stagnation, of the man whose\r\npower for good or evil extends to millions of people, to unlimited time;\r\nwhose influence shall be felt, and shall be shaping the destinies of\r\nunborn generations, after he shall be only a ghastly skeleton, a bundle\r\nof crumbling bones!\r\n\r\nWould that the power, the wisdom, the omniscience of God had not been\r\nrepudiated, discarded, abolished, by modern thinkers, so that now but\r\nfew feel any moral checks or dread of responsibility; for if there is to\r\nbe no final accounting, morality ceases to be a factor, there being no\r\nfear of any hereafter; and as a natural sequence, there is no remedy\r\nleft for the terrible \xe2\x80\x9c_palsy_.\xe2\x80\x9d For it is a well demonstrated fact that\r\n_sense of justice_, or pure _philanthropy_, alone, is but frail\r\nreliance. Fatally has man elevated his vanity to be his deity, with\r\negotism for the high priest, and the sole aim and object of life the\r\naccumulation of _money_, with no thought of the never-ending to-morrow,\r\nthe awakening on the limitless shore! no thought of his fellow-beings\r\nhere, of himself in the hereafter!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a high, solemn, almost awful thought,\xe2\x80\x9d says Carlyle, \xe2\x80\x9cfor every\r\nindividual man, that his earthly influence, which has had a\r\ncommencement, will never, through all ages\xe2\x80\x94were he the very meanest of\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94have an end! What is done, is done; has already blended itself with\r\nthe boundless, ever-living, ever-working universe, and will also work\r\nfor good or for evil, openly or secretly, throughout all time. The life\r\nof every man is as a well-spring of a stream, whose small beginnings are\r\nindeed plain to all, but whose ulterior course and destination, as it\r\nwinds through the expanses of infinite years, only the Omniscient can\r\ndiscern. Will it mingle with neighboring rivulets as a tributary, or\r\nreceive them as their sovereign? Is it to be a nameless brook, and with\r\nits tiny waters, among millions of other brooks and rills, increase the\r\ncurrent of some world\xe2\x80\x99s river? or is it to be itself a Rhine or a\r\nDanube, whose goings forth are to the uttermost lands, its floods an\r\neverlasting boundary-line on the globe itself, the bulwark and highway\r\nof whole kingdoms and continents? We know not, only, in either case, we\r\nknow its path is to the great ocean; its waters, were they but a\r\nhandful, are _here_, and cannot be annihilated or permanently held\r\nback.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut how many of the influential of the earth think thus? If only the\r\n_law-givers_ could be made to reflect more seriously, more\r\nconscientiously, upon the effect that their legislation must have on the\r\nlives, the destinies, of their fellow-beings _forever_, there would be\r\nmuch less misery and heart-rending wretchedness in this vale of tears.\r\nNow, the law-giver is a politician, who generally thinks more of his own\r\npolitical standing with _other politicians_ than of the interests\r\nentrusted to his care. To speak of constituents sounds well, but who are\r\nthe constituents? The men who govern them, who control votes, those who\r\nguide the majorities to the polls; the politicians, who make and unmake\r\neach other, they are the power\xe2\x80\x94the rest of the people dream that _they_\r\nare\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all. And if these law-givers see fit to _sell themselves_ for\r\nmoney, what then? Who has the power to undo what is done? Not their\r\nconstituents, surely. But the constituencies will be the sufferers, and\r\nfeel all the effect of pernicious legislation.\r\n\r\nThese were George Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts as he sat, with his uncle, in the\r\ngallery of the House of Representatives, listening to a debate, a few\r\ndays after their arrival in Washington. The attention of George,\r\nhowever, was divided between the debate and some papers he held in his\r\nhands which a member of Congress had given him. These papers contained\r\nseveral arguments, speeches and petitions, praying Congress to aid in\r\nthe construction of the Texas Pacific Railroad, thus to help the\r\nimpoverished South to regain her strength wasted in the war. Among these\r\npapers there was one which more particularly arrested his attention. It\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n   43d Congress,      _House of Representatives._     Mis. Doc.

                 _Central Pacific Railroad Company._\r\n\r\n        *Preamble and Resolutions submitted by* _Mr. Luttrell_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 12, 1874.\xe2\x80\x94Referred to the Committee on the Pacific Railroad, and\r\nordered to be printed, together with accompanying papers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Whereas_, The Central Pacific Railroad Company was incorporated by the\r\nState of California on the 27th day of June, A.D. 1861, to construct a\r\nrailroad to the eastern boundary of said State; and whereas, by Acts of\r\nCongress of the years 1862 and 1863, said company was authorized to\r\nextend said railroad eastward through the territory of the United States\r\nby an Act entitled \xe2\x80\x98An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and\r\ntelegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nreceived from the United States, under said Act and the Acts\r\nsupplemental thereto and amendatory thereof, and from the State of\r\nCalifornia and

whereas, the directors of said Central Pacific Railroad Company\r\nmade contracts with _certain of their own members_ to construct said\r\nroad, known as the \xe2\x80\x98Contract and Finance Company,\xe2\x80\x99 for consideration in\r\nlands, money, and bonds, far in excess of the actual cost of\r\nconstruction; and,\r\n\r\nWhereas, said Central Pacific Railroad is, and has been,

assignees of such bonds, lands, or\r\nother subsidies, are holders in good faith, and for a valuable\r\nconsideration, or procured the same illegally, or _by fraud_; * * * and\r\nto inquire into the character and purpose of such organization, and\r\nfully, of all the transactions of said Central Pacific Railroad Company,\r\nand all transactions had and contracted by and between the directors of\r\nthe Central Pacific Railroad Company and Charles Crocker & Co.; and of\r\nall transactions and contracts made by said directors with the \xe2\x80\x98Contract\r\nand Finance Company\xe2\x80\x99 for the furnishing of material of every kind and\r\ncharacter whatever, and the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad\r\nand other branch roads connected therewith; * * * and to report the\r\nfacts to this House, together with such bill as may be necessary to\r\nprotect the interests of the United States Government and the people, on\r\naccount of any bonds, lands and subsidies of the class hereinbefore\r\nreferred to, and against the combinations _to defraud the Government_\r\nand the people; and said committee is hereby authorized to send for\r\npersons and papers, and to report at any time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere follows a long recital of _frauds_ perpetrated by Messrs. Leland\r\nStanford, Huntington, Crocker and Hopkins, under the name of \xe2\x80\x9cCentral\r\nPacific Railroad Company\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cContract and Finance Company,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. Said\r\nfrauds, Mr. Luttrell says, were against the Government and against the\r\nstockholders of the Central Pacific Company. A Mr. Brannan, in a long\r\ncomplaint, sets forth also how and when these gentlemen _cheated_ the\r\nGovernment by presenting _false statements_ of the cost of constructing\r\nthe Central Pacific Railroad, and in other ways, and _cheated_ the\r\nstockholders of said railroad by issuing _to themselves_ the stock, and\r\nappropriating other subsidies, which should have been distributed _pro\r\nrata_ among all the stockholders.\r\n\r\nThe entire statement is a shameful exposure of disgraceful acts, any one\r\nof which, were it to be perpetrated by a poor man, would send him to the\r\npenitentiary.\r\n\r\nGeorge was shocked to read Mr. Luttrell\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c_Preamble and Resolutions_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand Mr. Brannan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c_complaint_.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lawrence Mechlin waited to read\r\nthem in the evening, at his hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese two gentlemen ever since their arrival had heard strange rumors\r\nabout Congressmen being \xe2\x80\x98_bribed with money_,\xe2\x80\x99 and in other _ways\r\nimproperly influenced by \xe2\x80\x98a certain railroad man,\xe2\x80\x99 who was organizing a\r\npowerful lobby to defeat the Texas Pacific Railroad_.\xe2\x80\x9d In his endeavors\r\nto aid Tom Scott, Mr. Lawrence Mechlin had come across some startling\r\nfacts regarding the manipulation of railroad bills, especially in the\r\nCongressional committees. Still, he was loth to believe that bribery\r\nwould be so openly used. He was a man of strict probity, slow to think\r\nany man dishonorable. George, brought up in the same school, felt, also,\r\na reluctance to believe that the Congress of these United States could\r\nbe packed, bundled, and labeled, by a few of its treacherous members,\r\nwho would sell themselves for money, in spite of their honest\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw! the thing is too preposterous,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said to his uncle, who,\r\nwith saddened voice, had answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it seems to me. Let us go to the Capitol again; I want to speak to\r\nsome of the Representatives; I have only seen Senators; I must talk with\r\nthe House a little.\xe2\x80\x9d And they had come, and were now listening to the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s business with the Attorney General had been more satisfactory.\r\nThe appeal was at last dismissed, and the joyful news had been\r\ntelegraphed to Don Mariano. There was now no dispute about the validity\r\nof his title. The Government itself had said that the land belonged to\r\nhim; would the squatters vacate now? We will see. Meantime, the\r\nremittitur had to be sent to the court below, and it was expected that\r\nCongress would soon make an appropriation to defray expenses of\r\nsurveying lands in California. George wrote to Don Mariano not to engage\r\nany surveyor to survey his rancho, as there would be an appropriation\r\nmade for lands to be surveyed by the Government.\r\n\r\nElvira and Mercedes were made very happy on hearing that the appeal was\r\ndismissed. They did not well understand what it all meant; but as they\r\nwere told that now the Government of the United States had said that the\r\nrancho belonged to their father, they naturally concluded that the\r\nsquatters would go away, and there would no longer be any trouble about\r\nthe destruction of their cattle, and their father not be so worried and\r\nunhappy.\r\n\r\nThus, life seemed very sweet to those two innocents, and they enjoyed\r\ntheir visit to Washington to the fullest extent. The Gunthers and\r\nSeldens had stopped at the same hotel with the Mechlins, and the three\r\nfamilies were constantly together. Their parlors in their evenings \xe2\x80\x9c_at\r\nhome_\xe2\x80\x9d were filled with a crowd of distinguished visitors; other\r\nevenings were given to parties and receptions. One cloud only cast a\r\nshadow on Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 brilliant surroundings, and this was the obvious\r\nmisery she saw in Arthur Selden\xe2\x80\x99s dejected countenance, and a certain\r\ndread she felt at the silent coldness of Robert Gunther. His eyes seemed\r\nto her darker than they used to be, but perhaps they seemed so because\r\nhe was so much paler. But what could she do? she asked herself, and\r\nwished very much that these two young gentlemen had remained in New\r\nYork, for, surely, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that she would give up Clarence!\r\nNo, indeed. Not for fifty thousand Gunthers, or two million Seldens.\r\n\r\nThere were times when the coldness of these two young gentlemen was very\r\nmarked, and, amiable as she was, she felt it. But her Clarence was\r\nalways near, and his superb eyes were watching, ready to come to her at\r\nthe slightest indication. It was so sweet to be so quickly understood\r\nand so promptly obeyed by him.\r\n\r\nThere had been a brilliant ball at one of the legations, and on the\r\nfollowing morning the Seldens and Gunthers were discussing the event in\r\nMrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made two new conquests last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said the eldest Miss Selden to\r\nMercedes. \xe2\x80\x9cThose two _attach\xc3\xa9s_ are now your new slaves. They are\r\nawfully in love. I felt pity for them, to see them so completely\r\ncaptivated. You ought to be proud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think they are in love, but, admitting it is so, why should I\r\nbe proud? I should be annoyed, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you expect us to believe that?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Selden asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may believe it, for it is the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are a strange girl, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so? Why should I wish men to fall in love with me, when I cannot\r\nreturn their love?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, evidently vexed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the first girl I ever saw that did not want to have admirers;\r\nyes, loads of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmirers and friends, yes; but you spoke of those young men being _in\r\nlove_. Now, if I thought so, I would be very sorry, and, as I do not\r\nwish to be unhappy, I hope you are mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Misses Selden laughed incredulously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion, no kind-hearted girl ought to desire to be loved except\r\nby the one she loves. Else, she must be a very heartless creature, who\r\nenjoys the miseries of others,\xe2\x80\x9d added she, earnestly. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I want you\r\nto know, I am not cruel; I am not heartless; so I do not wish any man\r\n(but one) to be in love with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Gunther interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the trouble is,\r\nyou are too pretty, too sweet, to be let alone; you can\xe2\x80\x99t help being\r\nloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I am unlucky, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, with trembling lips, \xe2\x80\x9cand the\r\nsooner I go home, the better it will be for mutual comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobert Gunther was talking with Elvira, but he had not lost one word of\r\nthis conversation. In the evening they went to a Presidential reception.\r\nIt happened that he was near Mercedes when Elvira proposed to go and see\r\nthe flowers in the conservatory; he offered her his arm, and they\r\nfollowed Elvira. He had spoken very few words to her since they returned\r\nfrom Newport, but had watched her and feasted his eyes on her\r\nloveliness. Now, after walking in silence for some time, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a sad sort of consolation to know that you regret inspiring\r\nhopeless love. I heard your conversation with the Misses Selden this\r\nmorning. I thank you for not enjoying my misery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! how could I do that? I wish I could make you happy; please forgive\r\nme if I have ever caused you pain?\xe2\x80\x9d said she in the sweetest of pleading\r\ntones. He looked at her sweet face, turned toward his, and his love for\r\nher seemed to rush upon him like an overwhelming wave\xe2\x80\x94like a hot flame\r\nrising to his brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mercedes, it is frightful how much I love you! What shall I do to\r\nconquer this unfortunate infatuation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForget me; I shall soon be away\xe2\x80\x94far away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! darling, I would rather suffer seeing you, than to have your sweet\r\npresence withdrawn from my sight. You see my unfortunate situation? I\r\nvow it is awful to love so hopelessly! But I shall never talk to you of\r\nmy love again. I see I pain you,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, seeing that she trembled and\r\nlooked pained. \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, for I am very wretched. My life will now be\r\na blank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could feel for me, as you do toward Elvira. How I envy her\r\nyour friendship,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in very low tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, truly?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed I do. I would be so happy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall try. But how can I, loving you so ardently?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs a proof of your love, try to be my friend\xe2\x80\x94only a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ask of my love a suicide\xe2\x80\x94to kill itself. Be it so. I shall try,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he with a sad smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThe request is rather novel, but perhaps it\r\nmight be done. I doubt it. I suppose you will be my friend then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am that now\xe2\x80\x94most sincerely,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, earnestly.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the conservatory, they saw Clarence coming to meet them. He\r\njoined Elvira and walked by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, Mr. Darrell. I am glad you have good sense,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gunther,\r\naddressing the back and broad shoulders of Clarence from the distance.\r\nMercedes laughed and felt herself regaining her composure.\r\n\r\nThey had now been in Washington ten days, and the ladies of the party\r\nhad only made one very hurried visit to the Capitol. This day Mrs.\r\nMechlin had set apart \xe2\x80\x9cto devote to Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and it was\r\narranged that they would go in the morning, would lunch at the Capitol,\r\nand remain part of the afternoon. A debate on the Texas Pacific Bill was\r\nexpected that day, and the Mechlins, as well as Clarence and Mercedes,\r\nwished to hear it. The President of the Senate put his rooms at the\r\nservice of Mrs. Mechlin and friends. Thus the ladies had a delightful\r\ntime, taking a recess in the President\xe2\x80\x99s parlor when they liked, or\r\nstrolling through the corridors, or sitting in the galleries.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, the party, walking toward the public reception room,\r\nwere met by five or six old men with very white beards. Two of them\r\nwalked slowly as if weakened by sickness, one walked on crutches, and\r\none had lost an arm, his coat-sleeve being pinned to his breast. Mr.\r\nMechlin stopped to shake hands with them, saying to his wife to go on,\r\nthat he wished to speak with these gentlemen. On rejoining the party,\r\nMr. Mechlin was asked by Miss Gunther where these venerable old\r\ngentlemen came from.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey looked like a little troop of patriarchs,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Selden added.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can they want at the Capitol?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey want bread,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThose men should be pensioned\r\nby our Government, but it is not done because Congress has not seen fit\r\nto do it. The three oldest of those men are veterans of the Mexican War.\r\nFor twenty-five years they have been asking the Government to grant them\r\na pension, a little pittance to help them along in their old age, but it\r\nis not done. Year after year the same prayers and remonstrances are\r\nrepeated in vain. Congress well knows how valuable were the services of\r\nthose who went to Mexico to conquer a vast domain; but, now we have the\r\ndomain, we don\xe2\x80\x99t care to be grateful or just. It would perhaps be a\r\nmatter of perfect indifference to half of our Congress should they hear\r\nthat all those poor veterans died of starvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\xe2\x80\x94_Looking at the Receding Dome._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that the gay New Yorkers, under Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_chaperoning_, had to do before they left the capital. They must make an\r\nexcursion across the Potomac to Arlington, and visit the tomb of\r\nWashington. Patriotism, she said, imposed this duty upon them, which\r\nmust be fulfilled with due reverence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Mechlin added, \xe2\x80\x9cthey would have a picnic under the\r\nglorious trees in the Arlington grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet our libations be on that sacred spot,\xe2\x80\x9d said George; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will pour\r\nwine on the grave of Washington\xe2\x80\x94that is, we will go close to it and\r\ndrink it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that we will drink the wine and rub the bottle devoutly upon\r\nthe monument, as the Irish woman did when she cured her rheumatism,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob\r\nGunther added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is awful how unpatriotic and irreverent are the young men nowadays,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiss Gunther said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it makes me weep,\xe2\x80\x9d added Arthur Selden, blinking.\r\n\r\nThere would be a day or two before the picnic, and Mercedes told George\r\nshe wanted to go to the dome of the Capitol, and see Washington City\r\nfrom that elevated place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe little puss shall have her wish,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, and on the following\r\nday all the party drove again to the Capitol, and walked through\r\nlabyrinths of dark corridors leading into committee rooms or may-be into\r\nsolemn judicial halls, where justice sat holding the scales in terrific\r\nsilence. Emerging from the cool, musty air of the lower halls, they\r\nagain visited the upper rooms and galleries, which Elvira and Mercedes\r\nliked better than on their former visits. Now all ascended to the\r\nhighest point they could go, and their exertions were amply rewarded by\r\nthe pleasure of seeing the beautiful panorama at their feet. Washington\r\nCity has been viewed and reviewed, and too minutely described to be\r\nconsidered any longer interesting to Eastern people, but to our\r\nCalifornians the view of that city of proud and symmetric proportions,\r\nwith its radiating avenues lost in diminishing distances, its little\r\ntriangular parks and haughty edifices, all making a picturesque\r\n_ensemble_, was most pleasing and startling.\r\n\r\nWith Clarence by her side, Mercedes looked carefully at the city that\r\nlike a magnificent picture lay there beneath them. She wished to carry\r\nit photographed in her memory.\r\n\r\nThe picnic to Arlington was much enjoyed by all. Mercedes would have\r\npreferred to walk over the grounds of Mount Vernon with Clarence alone,\r\nfor her love was of that pure character which longs to associate the\r\ncherished object with every thought and feeling having its source in our\r\nhighest faculties. She thought Mount Vernon ought to be visited\r\nreverently, and she knew Clarence would not laugh at her for thinking\r\nso. But, alas! those other young gentlemen had no such thoughts. They\r\nwere in high glee, determined to have fun, and enjoy it; and though\r\nMercedes and Miss Gunther told them they were behaving like vandals,\r\nsuch rebukes only increased their merriment, which continued even after\r\nthey recrossed the Potomac.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s party had at last to tear itself away from Washington, and\r\nhurry to New York, for the \xe2\x80\x9ccharity ball\xe2\x80\x9d was to come off in a few days;\r\nthen the Liederkranz and the Purim balls would follow\xe2\x80\x94all in the month\r\nof February\xe2\x80\x94and Mrs. Mechlin wished that Elvira and Mercedes should see\r\nthem all. They had been at masked balls in Washington at the house of a\r\nSenator and of a foreign minister, but Mrs. Mechlin said that no masked\r\nballs in America could or did equal those given in New York at the\r\nAcademy of Music, consequently it became an absolute necessity that\r\nthese two young ladies should see those grand affairs. Moreover, she was\r\none of the matrons of the charity ball, and her presence was\r\nindispensable to attend to their management.\r\n\r\nA special car was again in readiness, and the Mechlin party occupied it\r\none morning at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The party was now increased by the\r\naddition of six ladies and eight gentlemen from Washington, who were\r\ngoing to attend the charity ball and Liederkranz. The train was in\r\nmotion, going out of the city limits, accelerating its speed as it\r\nplunged into the woods beyond. George and Clarence sat at one end of the\r\ncar, separate from the company, looking at the Capitol, as it seemed to\r\nretreat, flying with receding celerity. The woods were beginning to\r\nintercept its view at times\xe2\x80\x94the dome would disappear and reappear again\r\nand again above the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin joined the two young men, saying to them, as he turned the\r\nseat in front, and sat facing them: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are watching the receding\r\nCapitol. I was doing the same. I wonder whether your thoughts were like\r\nmine in looking at that proud edifice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think my thoughts were about the same subject, uncle. What were your\r\nthoughts, Darrell? Tell us,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of your father and of Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x94thinking that under\r\nthat white shining dome their fate would be decided perhaps, as they\r\nboth have embarked so hopefully in the boat of the Texas Pacific\r\nRailroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge and his uncle looked at each other as if saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe all were of\r\nthe same mind, surely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence Mechlin said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe certainly were thinking nearly alike, Mr.\r\nDarrell, with this difference, may-be, that I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel as hopeful as I\r\ndid a few weeks ago, when you and I talked about the fair chances of the\r\nTexas Pacific as we looked at that same white dome when we were coming\r\ndown. Now I am very fearful that the sad condition of the impoverished\r\nSouth is not going to have the weight which it deserves in the minds of\r\nthis Congress. I talked with many of our law-givers about the matter,\r\nand all seemed not to realize the importance, the policy, the humanity\r\nof helping the South, and of giving to the Pacific Coast a competing\r\nrailway, to get California out of the clutches of a grasping monopoly.\r\nAll agree that it ought to be done, but it looks as if few put their\r\nhearts into the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTheir hearts are in their pockets, uncle, and I am afraid that after\r\nall our reluctance to believe that our Congressmen can be improperly\r\ninfluenced, we will have to submit\xe2\x80\x94with shame and sorrow\xe2\x80\x94and accept the\r\nfact that bribery has been at work, _successfully_. The chief of the\r\nlobby is king.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet\xe2\x80\x94not yet. It is a frightful thought. Let us not accept it yet.\r\nLet us think it is an error, but not knavery. I am coming down again, I\r\nthink, before this session is over. I want to see more before I am\r\nconvinced. I have my fears and my doubts, but I still hope\xe2\x80\x94_must_\r\nhope\xe2\x80\x94that our Congress has many honest men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can hope\xe2\x80\x94but it will be in vain,\xe2\x80\x9d George said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe money of the\r\nCentral Pacific Railroad will be too much for Colonel Scott.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be so desponding, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t have any hope in this Congress. There never can be any better\r\narguments in favor of the Texas Pacific than are now plain to everybody.\r\nSo, then, if in the face of all these powerful considerations Congress\r\nturns it back and will not hear the wail of the prostrate South, or the\r\nimpassionate appeals of California, now, _now_, when there is not one\r\nsolitary reason under heaven why such appeals and entreaties should be\r\ndisregarded, is there any ground to expect any better in the uncertain\r\nfuture? Certainly not. But still, I do not say that we should abandon\r\nall hope. For the sake of my father, who has trusted so much in the\r\nTexas Pacific, I am glad you will do all you can to help Colonel Scott.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly shall,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin replied. Then, after a few minutes of\r\nsilence, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf our legislators could only be induced to adopt\r\nHerbert Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s view of _the duties of law-givers_, there would be far\r\nless misery in the United States. If they could but stop to see how\r\nclearly it stands to reason that \xe2\x80\x98legislative deductions must be based\r\nupon _fundamental morality_,\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98the inferences of political economy\r\nare true, only because they are discoveries by a roundabout process of\r\n_what the moral law commands_.\xe2\x80\x99 It is an unfortunate mistake that the\r\nwords \xe2\x80\x98_moral law_\xe2\x80\x99 are generally understood to apply practically only\r\nto private conduct; to a man\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity to his marriage vows; to his\r\nreligious belief; this we learn at school. But these words are only\r\nloosely applied (if at all) to a man\xe2\x80\x99s actions as a legislator. I never\r\nheard in election times that any one expects our law-givers to base\r\ntheir legislation upon _fundamental morality_, and regard expediency as\r\na secondary consideration. Congressmen know that they are expected to\r\nwatch the material interests of their States or counties, but they do\r\nnot feel any moral responsibility to see that other _constituencies_ do\r\nnot suffer injustice. Thus, if the Congressmen of one State choose to\r\nbetray the rights of their constituencies, other Congressmen generally\r\nlook on indifferently, or, perhaps, amused\xe2\x80\x94and do not interfere any more\r\nthan they would in the domestic affairs of perfect strangers. They do\r\nnot seem to perceive that on the very instant in which they see that a\r\ncommunity, or an individual, is being wronged by the neglect or design\r\nof their own representatives, that then any other Congressman should\r\ncome forward to protect the betrayed community or defenseless citizen.\r\nThis is clearly their duty. But it seems to be ignored by tacit consent.\r\nAll Congressmen are ready to offer objections to every conceivable\r\nmeasure. To jump up and shout _against_ anything, seems to be thought\r\nthe proof of a man being a good legislator. Combativeness is the one\r\nfaculty ever in use to offer _obstructions_, and thus necessary and\r\nuseful legislation is foolishly retarded, and untold misery is brought\r\nupon innocent citizens. All this is a mistake. Because the \xe2\x80\x98_fundamental\r\nlaw of morality_\xe2\x80\x99 is not understood. Herbert Spencer says: \xe2\x80\x98Now, this\r\nthat we call _moral law_ is simply a statement of the _conditions_ of\r\nbeneficial action. Originating in the primary necessities of things, it\r\nis the development of these into a series of limitations within which\r\nall conduct conducive to the greatest happiness must be confined. To\r\noverstep such limitations is to disregard these necessities of things,\r\nto fight against the constitution of nature.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Spencer applies this\r\naxiom to the happiness of individuals, as well as of entire communities.\r\nIf the principles of fundamental morality were better understood and\r\nmore conscientiously respected, railroad manipulators would find it\r\nimpossible to organize a lobby to defeat all laws intended to aid the\r\nTexas Pacific. But I repeat, in spite of all discouragement, I will use\r\nmy best efforts to help the Texas Pacific, as I firmly believe every\r\nhonest man in these United States ought to do, even when not directly\r\ninterested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe journey to New York was accomplished safely by our party, and in\r\ngood time for the charity ball. Mrs. Mechlin and Mrs. Gunther being in\r\nthe list of its distinguished matrons, busied themselves about that\r\ngrand affair from the day after their return until its successful\r\n_finale_, which was also a success pecuniarily.\r\n\r\nTo the charity ball follow the Liederkranz and the Purim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you to go masked, George?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Mechlin asked, as they were\r\ndiscussing the coming ball with Miss Gunther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think not. I think the best plan is to wear a domino and mask, as\r\nwe go in with you ladies, so that you may not be recognized. Then after\r\nawhile we will leave you and go out into the vestibule and take off our\r\nmasks and return unmasked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not keep masked?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we will have no fun at all with masks on. The ladies not\r\nknowing who we are will have nothing to say to us. But if they see who\r\nwe are, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll come and talk saucily, thinking we will not\r\nrecognize them. We will, though, and then the fun begins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows at home what my domino is to look like, but I think Bob\r\nwill recognize my voice, and know who we all are, as he knows I am going\r\nwith you,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gunther said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut is he not to be of our party?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Mechlin asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he is going to escort Miss Selden. My brother Charles will be my\r\nescort. He will be in our secret, of course. How I wish we could mystify\r\nBob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t, if we speak to him, as he will recognize our voices,\r\nMercedes and mine, by our accent immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can mimic the German way of talking English, and Mercedes can talk\r\nhalf French and half English, with an Irish brogue,\xe2\x80\x9d George suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe talks Irish brogue to perfection,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to practice before I would speak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPractice every day\xe2\x80\x94you have six days yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Mechlin said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo, Miss Mercedes. I would like you to fool Bob,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Gunther said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must make your voice sound guttural. Your voice is naturally\r\nvery musical. You must disguise it,\xe2\x80\x9d George suggested.\r\n\r\nMercedes followed his suggestion, and by carefully imitating Mrs.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s French maid (who spoke very broken English and stammered a\r\ngood deal), she passed herself off for a stammering French girl, who was\r\nvery talkative, in spite of the difficulty in her speech\xe2\x80\x94maintaining her\r\n_r\xc3\xb4le_ so well that neither Bob nor Arthur recognized her until she took\r\noff her mask. Then the faces of the two young men were a study. They\r\nboth had paid most ardent compliments to her feet and hands, and had\r\nearnestly begged for the privilege of calling upon her, which she\r\ngranted, promising to give the number of her house when she unmasked.\r\nShe had danced with both several times, and had asked them to present\r\nGeorge and Clarence to her. Both of whom also asked her to dance, and\r\nwhile dancing had a good laugh at the expense of the two deluded ones.\r\n\r\nWhen she unmasked, Selden left the ball in the midst of the peals of\r\nlaughter from those who understood the joke. Bob stood his ground, with\r\nthe crimson blush up to his ears and eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact of the matter is, that you will attract me always, no matter\r\nunder what disguise,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered to Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Pas si bete_,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, stammering fearfully, and looking the\r\nprettier for it.\r\n\r\nThe Liederkranz and Purim balls were highly enjoyed also, but Mercedes,\r\nthough in domino, assumed no _r\xc3\xb4le_. She was very amiable to Bob and\r\nArthur, to heal the wound of their lacerated vanity.\r\n\r\nThe winter had now passed, and spring came\xe2\x80\x94bringing to our Californians\r\nthoughts of returning home.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining brightly on Madison Square\xe2\x80\x94there had been a heavy\r\nshower that morning, in the early March\xe2\x80\x94which had washed the snow off\r\nthe pavements into the sewers, leaving the streets clean. Children were\r\nout with their nurses in the square, among the trees, which were trying\r\nhard to bud out, but as yet succeeded very poorly. Still, there were\r\nsome little birds of sanguine temperament, chirping like good optimists\r\nabout the ungainly, denuded branches, calculating philosophically on\r\ncoming green leaves, though vegetation was slow to awake from its winter\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nClarence, from his window at the hotel, saw that the day was bright, and\r\nhastened, in an open carriage, to take Elvira and Mercedes out for a\r\ndrive in the park. They first went down for George, who had not yet left\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you get letters from home to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and among them a long one from Don Mariano,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he say? Any good news for poor papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has just made twenty thousand dollars, any way, in spite of\r\nsquatters. And he will make sixty thousand dollars more if he will do\r\nwhat I asked him in my letter to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did he make twenty thousand dollars?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked, with a\r\nbrightened look, which was reflected in the beautiful eyes of the\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy sending five hundred steers to Fred Haverly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre five hundred steers worth that much?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked, surprised.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94at forty dollars per head\xe2\x80\x94which for large cattle is not too high a\r\nprice. That is what Fred has been paying for cattle weighing in the\r\nneighborhood of four hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe best thing Don Mariano can do is to sell you all his cattle, even\r\nat half of this price,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I have been writing to him to-day. As I have to buy cattle\r\nfor the mines, and I am willing to pay him a good price, he ought to\r\nsell them all to me, and when he gets his rancho clear of trespassers\r\nthen buy finer breeds and restock the rancho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most excellent idea,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\nRobert Gunther passed by, driving his four-in-hand at a furious speed,\r\nwith a very handsome girl sitting by his side. He bowed as he passed.\r\n\r\nMercedes laughed, saying he looked \xe2\x80\x9csheepish,\xe2\x80\x9d and though he did not\r\nhear what she said, he blushed to the roots of his hair, and ran against\r\na heavy carriage which slowly rolled ahead of him, loaded with four\r\nelderly ladies, who screamed terrified. This mishap only increased Bob\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfusion, forcing him to check his speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want our assistance?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks. If people did not come to drive their funerals through the\r\npark, no one would run over them,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you want to kill them, so as not to have funerals without dead\r\nbodies?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe merciful! Remember your name is Mercedes,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor, embarrassed\r\nBob.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mercedes wafted a kiss to him, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThat goes as a peace\r\noffering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, yes; I understand,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, following her with his eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cA kiss\r\nto the empty air is all you will ever give me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\xe2\x80\x94_Perplexities at Alamar._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has generally been the custom of biographers to treat their subject\r\nafter he is resting peacefully in his grave, indifferent to the world\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nopinion. Seldom has a man \xe2\x80\x9c_been written_\xe2\x80\x9d (in a biography) until he is\r\npast knowing what is said of him in print. Epitaphs are non-committal,\r\nor laudatory only, and too brief; they are solely a charitable or\r\naffectionate tribute to the dead, intended to please the living.\r\nBiographies\xe2\x80\x94it is to be supposed\xe2\x80\x94are intended, or should be, admonitory;\r\nto teach men by the example of the one held up to view\xe2\x80\x94be this an\r\nexample to be followed or to be avoided. But if no offense be intended\r\nby the biographer, why wait until a man is forevermore beyond hearing\r\nwhat is said of him, before his fellows are told in what and how he\r\nsurpassed them so much as to be considered worthy of special notice? If\r\nhe ought to be reproved, let him know it; and if we must worship him as\r\na hero, let him know it also. Only such an irascible man\xe2\x80\x94for instance\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nDr. Johnson was, could have received the homage of admiration and\r\nreverence such as Boswell\xe2\x80\x99s, so impatiently, almost ungratefully. It is\r\nmore natural for man to receive incense at least passively, and endeavor\r\nto deserve it. Biographies, therefore, ought to be intended, not to\r\nmislead readers, but to instruct them. From this point of view, then, it\r\nwould be difficult to say flattering things of Mr. Darrell, and more\r\ndifficult yet to say them of the other squatters of Alamar, in a\r\nbiographical sketch.\r\n\r\nMr. Darrell did not receive the news of the appeal being dismissed as\r\nMrs. Darrell and Clarence had hoped. Mr. Darrell was evidently out of\r\nhumor with the executive branch of the Government\xe2\x80\x94with the Attorney\r\nGeneral\xe2\x80\x94and he discussed the matter with himself in many an animated\r\nsoliloquy. High as his opinion of Congress was and had always been, he,\r\nin his ill humor, even went so far as to say\xe2\x80\x94to himself\xe2\x80\x94that this much\r\nrespected body of legislators had been entirely too lenient with the\r\nconquered natives. Congress ought to have confiscated all their lands\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9conly allowed them one hundred and sixty acres _each_.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea\r\nthat they (the conquered) should be better off than the Americans! They\r\nshould have been put on an equality with other settlers, and much honor\r\nto them, too, would have been thereby, for why should these _inferior_\r\npeople be more considered than the Americans?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInferior? What are you talking about? It is enough to see one of those\r\nAlamar ladies to learn that they are inferior to nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nDarrell, happening to overhear the last words of her lord\xe2\x80\x99s soliloquy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither are the Californians considered _better than Americans_ because\r\nthe Government did not take _all_ their lands from them. I declare,\r\nWilliam, you have gone back to your old unfortunate ideas which brought\r\nso many troubles to us in Napa and Sonoma. You forget those troubles,\r\nand you are ready to bring them back again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t; but I always will maintain that the Spanish Californians\r\nshould not have a right to any more land than Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they have not. The Government does not give them any more land; all\r\nthey ask and expect is that the Government may _not take away what they\r\nhad_. You see this perfectly well, and you know that every time you have\r\ndisregarded this truth, we have suffered. This time it might lead to\r\nworse suffering, since it is Clarence that might be made very miserable;\r\nand if he is, so must I. Then good-by happiness for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should Clarence be made miserable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he is devotedly attached to Miss Mercedes; and if you are to be\r\nthe enemy of her family, perhaps she will not marry him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarry him? Does Clarence think she will marry him? She marry a\r\nsquatter?\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed derisively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence is no squatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the son of a squatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been one, but if you keep your word, and this land is paid\r\nfor, you will not be a squatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose Clarence followed the girl to New York, believing she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmarry him. I thought he would have more sense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he did follow her, he would also be following his father\xe2\x80\x99s example.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Darrell blushed, but he smiled, for he was pleased. The recollection\r\nof that tender episode of loving devotion was always very sweet to him.\r\nIt had been a folly of which he was proud to cherish the memory.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Darrell did not pursue the subject any further this time; he\r\nfelt he would be defeated if he continued it; it was best to beat a\r\nmasterly retreat before he was routed. He made an orderly march toward\r\nthe stable, and Mrs. Darrell, remaining master of the field, busied\r\nherself with her flower garden, where Alice presently joined her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma dear, I overheard your conversation with papa; I hope you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet him quarrel with the Don.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall do my best to prevent it, but you see, he has all the settlers\r\nat his heels all the time worrying him about their claims. Any one might\r\nsuppose that he induced them to come here, instead of being induced by\r\nthem. Since they heard that their appeal was dismissed, they have openly\r\nsaid to him that they rely entirely upon his assistance to retain their\r\nhomes. This pleases him, it flatters him, but it is a piece of hypocrisy\r\non their part, because the Don is too kind-hearted to eject them.\r\nClarence says that the Don will let them keep their homesteads, on the\r\nsole condition that they put up fences to keep his cattle off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan anything be more kind and generous?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut all his kindness is thrown away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, there is this much to be said, that if papa will insist\r\nupon wanting to be a squatter, and favor squatters, he will find that\r\nnot one of his family approves it. No, not even the children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it; Jane and Lucy feel very badly about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so does Everett; Webster don\xe2\x80\x99t like it either. We all feel very\r\nbadly to see papa so wrong, and the worst of it is, how it all might\r\naffect our darling Clarence, who is so sweet and so good to all of\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94yes, to everybody. I do hope he will marry Mercedes. I know she loves\r\nhim dearly. I am so afraid that papa will quarrel with the Don, and\r\nClarence and Mercedes be separated. It would be awful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf sweet Alice had said all she held in her dear heart, and which might\r\nbe affected by the course that her father would pursue between the\r\nsettlers and the Don, she would have revealed other anxieties besides\r\nthose she felt on Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s account. The thought that Victoriano, too,\r\nmight be estranged from her, had made that dear heart of hers very heavy\r\nwith forebodings. Gentle and loving though she was, she could not help\r\nfeeling exasperated to foresee how miserable she and Clarence, and\r\nMercedes and Victoriano might all be, all on account of this squatter\r\nquarrel, which might so easily be avoided if those people were not so\r\nperverse, and her father upholding them, which was perversity, also.\r\n\r\nThus ran Alice\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts as she helped her mother to trim the fuschias\r\nand train them up the posts of the porch, beside the honeysuckle and\r\nroses, which already formed an arbor over the front steps. Occasionally\r\nshe would look up the valley; it was time that Victoriano should be\r\nriding out with Gabriel or his father, superintending the gathering of\r\ntheir cattle, to be sent to the Sierra.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear, now that the Government, by the dismissal of\r\nthe appeal, acknowledged that Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s title was good, now, when by\r\nthis decision, the settlers should have made up their minds to leave the\r\npremises or purchase their homesteads from the owner of the land, now\r\ntheir disgraceful destruction of dumb animals was renewed with obvious\r\nvirulence, and every night the firing of rifles and shot-guns was heard\r\nall over the rancho. Don Mariano saw that this devastation was a\r\nmalicious revenge, which he could not avert, so he began to collect his\r\nstock to take them all to the mountains. About that time he received the\r\nletter in which Clarence proposed to buy all of his cattle, advising him\r\nto restock the rancho afterwards, when cleared of all trespassers. He\r\nliked the proposition, and immediately gave orders to drive all the\r\ncattle to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s rancho as they were got together; there to be put\r\nin a valley and kept in a sort of depot, as they were gathered and\r\nbrought in bands of any number, to wait until Clarence returned. But as\r\nafterwards Don Mariano feared that by the time Clarence came back, there\r\nwould be no cattle left to sell, he now hastened their gathering and\r\ndecided to send them off as soon as possible. Patiently, and without a\r\nword of complaint, Don Mariano and his two sons would ride out every day\r\nto superintend personally the collecting of the cattle and sending them\r\noff to his sister\xe2\x80\x99s rancho to the valley, where the rendezvous or depot\r\nhad been established. Victoriano named this valley the \xe2\x80\x9c_rodeo triste_,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninsisting that the cattle knew it was a \xe2\x80\x9c_rodeo triste_,\xe2\x80\x9d and walked to\r\nit sadly, guessing that they were to be exiled and butchered. \xe2\x80\x9cJust like\r\nourselves, the poor natives,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctossed from one cruelty to\r\nanother still worse, and then crushed out.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c_Rodeo triste_\xe2\x80\x9d was a very\r\nappropriate name, considering the fact of its being different from the\r\ngay and boisterous gatherings of other years, when \xe2\x80\x9cthe boys\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nsurrounding ranchos all assembled at Alamar to separate their cattle and\r\nhave a grand time marking and branding the calves; twisting the tails of\r\nstubborn ones by way of a logical demonstration, a convincing argument\r\nconveyed in that persuasive form, which was to a calf always\r\nunanswerable and irresistible. Then the day\xe2\x80\x99s work and fun would wind up\r\nwith a hilarious barbecue. But this was all in the past, which had been\r\nhappy, and was now a fading tableau.\r\n\r\nAlice, watching from behind the honeysuckle, saw Don Mariano, his two\r\nsons and three _vaqueros_ ride down the valley. There they separated,\r\neach followed by a _vaquero_, going in different directions.\r\n\r\nBut Alice was not the only one watching the riders going out to gather\r\nstray cattle. Though with very different sentiments from those which\r\nagitated her loving heart, the entire population of the rancho had been\r\nattentive, though unseen, spectators of the Don\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings. In the\r\nevenings the neighbors would come to relate to Darrell how many head of\r\ncattle and horses they had seen pass by their farms, and renew their\r\ncomments thereon.\r\n\r\nThus six weeks passed. The remittitur from the Supreme Court to the\r\nUnited States District Court at San Francisco came. This caused a ripple\r\nof excitement among the settlers. Then a bigger one\xe2\x80\x94a perfect tidal\r\nwave\xe2\x80\x94was expected with the surveyors that would come to make the survey\r\nof the rancho; and when this should be finished, then the grandest and\r\nlast effort must be made by the settlers to prevent the approval of it.\r\nThus, at least, they would have more litigation, and while the case was\r\nin the courts, they would still be on the rancho raising crops, and\r\npaying no taxes and no rent, as they knew perfectly well that the Don\r\nwould never sue them for \xe2\x80\x9crents and profits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverett had gone to town for the mail that day; letters from Clarence\r\nwere expected. The neighbors knew it, for by dint of asking questions\r\nthey had learned to time the arrival of his letters, and would drop in\r\nquite accidentally, but unerringly, and in an off-hand manner ask if\r\nthere was \xe2\x80\x9cany news from Mr. Clarence?\xe2\x80\x9d The Don, with his two sons and\r\nthree _vaqueros_, had gone out in search of his cattle, as usual, just\r\nas if no _remittitur_ had come. The settlers thought this was a most\r\nexcellent subject to ventilate with their neighbor, Darrell; they came\r\nin goodly numbers, \xe2\x80\x9cto _revolve_ the matter, and talk it over in a\r\n_neighborly_ way,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Hughes had said, with his perennial smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so; sit down, sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darrell replied; and when all having\r\ndragged chairs and pulled them forward from between their knees, had\r\ndropped upon them, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat may happen to be the matter we are to\r\nrevolve?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the remittitur, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes replied, in his oiliest tones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I thought something new,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a clincher, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but we knew it was coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think it queer that the Don be hurrying off his cattle, now\r\nthat he\xe2\x80\x99s won his suit? Don\xe2\x80\x99t that look as if he don\xe2\x80\x99t put much trust in\r\nhis victory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe trusts his victory, but he knows that more stock has been shot for\r\nthe last six weeks than for six months previous. He wants to save _a\r\nfew_ head,\xe2\x80\x9d said Romeo Hancock, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoper told me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes, ignoring what Romeo said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat, if the\r\nsettlers wish it, this case might be kept in the courts for fifty\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the land is surveyed?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, after the survey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe begin our new war by _objecting_ to the survey, I suppose; ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d Miller asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what Roper says,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, meantime, harass the enemy like the deuce,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly; that is Roper\xe2\x80\x99s advice,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews.\r\n\r\nWith a gesture of disgust, Romeo said: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, no cattle having been\r\nshot in this rancho before Roper advised it, let the harassing begin\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, young man, you had better get more years over your head\r\nbefore you talk so glibly,\xe2\x80\x9d Billy Mathews snarled at Romeo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a settler like yourself, Mr. Mathews, and he has as good a right\r\nto express his opinion, though he may not have the happiness of being\r\nold,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Everett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me that all the young bloods on this rancho are either on\r\nthe fence or have bolted clean over to the other side, Mr. Darrell,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mathews, addressing his remarks to the elder Darrell, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\r\nforget that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t girls enough to go round. There are only two\r\nleft, if, as rumor says, Mr. Clarence has taken the blue-eyed one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoper says those girls must have done good service in Washington to get\r\nthe appeal dismissed so quick.\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said, grinning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Roper is a dirty-minded dog to say that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make him eat his\r\ndirty words, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll take his hide off of his filthy carcass,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett\r\nsaid, jumping up from his seat, livid with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit still, Retty,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darrell said, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody minds what Roper says,\r\nexcept, perhaps, in law matters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people do mind what the whelp says, as he is quoted here,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett\r\nargued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to be so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like women\xe2\x80\x99s names mixed up in men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRoper only said that, because we heard that those girls were in\r\nWashington with a gay crowd, who took them from New York,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a crowd who went as guests of Mr. Lawrence Mechlin,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett\r\nreplied; \xe2\x80\x9ca New York banker, and brother of this Mr. Mechlin here. Mr.\r\nMechlin engaged a special car, as George wanted to take his wife and\r\nsister-in-law to visit the capital, and then two other families (of the\r\nhighest and best in New York) were invited, and all made a party to\r\nspend three weeks in Washington. Clarence being a friend of George\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s, was invited, also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may all be, but we heard that the crowd was a gay one, running\r\nabout the corridors and taking lunches at the Capitol with Senators,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGasbang explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd as that is the way things are managed when there\r\nare any axes to grind, Roper guessed that the girls had been pressed\r\ninto service to help with their smiles to bamboozle Senators.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vile little reptile; I\xe2\x80\x99ll put my heel on him yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everett,\r\nwith white lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely that Clarence would have stayed by, seeing Mercedes\r\nsmiling improperly on anybody, if he cares for her. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a son\r\nof mine if he did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, frowning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; that is all a very mean talk of Roper\xe2\x80\x99s. Attorney General Williams\r\nhad promised George Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s uncle, six months ago, to dismiss the\r\nappeal as soon as the Supreme Court should be session, and, though it\r\ncuts us all to pieces, I must say he kept his word like a man; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was that infernal, dandified puppy George Mechlin, who did the\r\nmischief. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be even with him yet for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Old Mathews growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t George Mechlin help his father-in-law? Because it upsets\r\nthe liver of the amiable Mr. Mathews?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Romeo, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep quiet, Romeo,\xe2\x80\x9d Old Hancock said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf George Mechlin hadn\xe2\x80\x99t helped, the thing would have been done in some\r\nother way. It had to come,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that; these Californians are too ignorant to know\r\nhow to defend their rights, and too lazy to try, unless some American\r\nprompts them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey know enough to employ a lawyer to defend their rights,\xe2\x80\x9d Old Miller\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but, after all, they have to use influence in Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d Old\r\nMathews insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what influence have they, unless it is by the aid\r\nof some American?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the pretty daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d added Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind the pretty daughters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miller, seeing that Everett\r\nclenched his fists as if ready to pounce upon Gasbang at the next\r\nprovocation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question now is, what is to be done? and who is for\r\nus, and who against? The time has come when we have to count noses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what are you going to do, Mr. Darrell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked velvety Hughes, with\r\nhis sickly smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. What is there for me to do? You heard me promise to the Don\r\nthat I would pay him for the land I was locating, if it was decided that\r\nthe title was his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said _when the title is settled_,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe title is settled as far as the Government is concerned. As you\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nsettlers\xe2\x80\x94and the Government were on one side, and the Don on the other,\r\nI guess he now naturally supposes I must regard the title as _settled_,\r\nsince the principal opponent (the Government) has thrown up the sponge,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nDarrell answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mathews; \xe2\x80\x9cand as long as we keep up the fight I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see how the title can be considered settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is settled with the Government, which was the question when I made\r\nmy location,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to desert our cause?\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be our\r\nfriend to the last, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is my intention, but what I might think I ought to do,\r\ncircumstances will point out to me. Probably we will see our way better\r\nafter the survey is made. Meantime, as the Don don\xe2\x80\x99t trouble any one\r\nwith orders to vacate, the best thing to do is to keep quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd spare his cattle,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo added, looking at Mathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem to want to pick a quarrel with me, youngster,\xe2\x80\x9d growled\r\nMathews.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you think so? Did _you_ ever shoot any of the Don\xe2\x80\x99s cattle,\r\nthat you should appropriate my remarks to yourself? If you never did, I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t mean you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boys, the young men, all laughed. Mathews arose, too angry to remain\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext time I come to talk business\xe2\x80\x94serious business\xe2\x80\x94with men, with men\r\nof my age\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be twitted by any youngster. Children should\r\nbe seen, and not heard,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting on his hat energetically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Mathews, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call me a youngster. You forget I am a\r\nmarried man,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo replied, with great amiability. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a papa, I am.\r\nOur baby is now six months old; he weighed twelve pounds when he was\r\nborn. Now, can you show us a baby of _your own_, only as old as that,\r\nand weigh half as much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shout of laughter that followed these words was too much for\r\nMathews. The banging of doors as he left was the only answer he deigned\r\nto give.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mathews! Five pounds! Two-and-a-half, Mr. Mathews!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Romeo\r\nfrom the window, to the retreating form of Billy, swiftly disappearing\r\nin long strides along the garden walk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the hardest hit Mathews ever got. He is awfully sensitive about\r\nhaving always been jilted and never been married,\xe2\x80\x9d Miller said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never forgive you,\xe2\x80\x9d added old Hancock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe never has forgiven me for locating my claim either, but I manage to\r\nsurvive. One more grievance can\xe2\x80\x99t sour him much more,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo replied,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nAfter Mathews had made his exit, the conversation went on more\r\nharmoniously. Gasbang was now the only malignant spirit present, but\r\nbeing very cowardly, he felt that as Mathews\xe2\x80\x99 support was withdrawn, and\r\nthe other settlers were inclined to abide by Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s advice, he would\r\nbe politic; he would listen only and report to Peter Roper. Gasbang knew\r\nwell how unreliable Roper was, but as they were interested in sundry\r\nenterprises of a doubtful character, he consulted Peter in all matters\r\nwhen found sober.\r\n\r\nDarrell\xe2\x80\x99s advice being to \xe2\x80\x9ckeep quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d the meeting soon broke up and\r\nthe settlers went home by their separate ways, all more or less\r\npersuaded that, after all, peace was the best thing all around. Old Mr.\r\nHancock gave utterance to this sentiment as he stopped by the gate of\r\nthe Darrell garden to say good-night to his neighbors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard the Don say that he does not blame us settlers so much for\r\ntaking his land as he blames our law-givers for those laws which induce\r\nus to do so\xe2\x80\x94laws which are bound to array one class of citizens against\r\nanother class, and set us all by the ears,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I heard him say about the same thing, but I thought he said it\r\nbecause he was a hypocrite, and to keep us from shooting his cattle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGasbang added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what might be his motive, the sentiment is kind anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHancock, senior, said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said the others, still unwilling to yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\xe2\x80\x94_Home Again._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 25th day of May, of \xe2\x80\x9974, Elvira and Mercedes found themselves\r\nagain under the paternal roof of their California home, in the Alamar\r\nrancho. They could have arrived ten days sooner had they left New York\r\non the first of the month, as was first intended. This they were not\r\nallowed to do, because when Mrs. L. Mechlin heard that Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbirthday would be on the 5th of May, she immediately said she could not\r\nand would not think of allowing Mercedes to spend her eighteenth\r\nbirthday in the cars. Consequently, invitations would be issued the\r\nfollowing day (which was the 22d of April) for \xe2\x80\x9c_A f\xc3\xaate in celebration\r\nof Miss Alamar\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, on the 5th day of May_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe invitations were issued thus early to prevent friends of Mrs.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s from going into the country for the summer, as many of them\r\ndid every year, in May. All, however, accepted, and waited most\r\ngraciously.\r\n\r\nThe season was already too far advanced, and the nights were getting too\r\nwarm to enjoy dancing, so Mrs. Mechlin thought it would be better to\r\nhave an excursion to West Point; to charter a river steamer, and thus\r\npass the day on the water; to take breakfast on board on the way to the\r\nPoint; visit the Post; see the cadets drill and review; and re-embark;\r\ntake dinner on board, and then the young people dance on deck, as there\r\nwould be a full band to give them music.\r\n\r\nThis was the programme\xe2\x80\x94which though decided upon hurriedly, on their\r\nreturn from Baltimore, where they had been visiting\xe2\x80\x94was carried out\r\nsuccessfully. All their pleasure excursions had been equally delightful.\r\nThey had visited Boston first, then they went to Philadelphia, intending\r\nto remain only three or four days, but when they were there, Mrs.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s relatives in Baltimore sent urgent invitations to visit them,\r\nso there was nothing else to do but accept. Thus the jaunt to\r\nPhiladelphia was extended to Baltimore, and might have been prolonged,\r\nhad not Elvira refused to be separated from George one day more. This\r\nyoung gentleman, on his part, seemed to have thought, too, that Elvira\r\nhad been away long enough. For as the party were waiting for the train\r\nto move out of the depot who should come aboard but this same young\r\ngentleman, George Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elvira, perfectly overjoyed at the sight of that\r\nbeloved apparition, throwing her arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecious,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, clasping her to his heart.\r\n\r\nAnd now Elvira and Mercedes, surrounded by their beloved family, were\r\nrelating this episode and many other occurrences of their eastern visit,\r\nall sitting in their favorite front veranda.\r\n\r\nThe Holman girls were there, too. They had made several visits to\r\nCarlota and Rosario within the last ten months, but this time they came\r\nto see Elvira and Mercedes. Mr. Holman himself had accompanied them,\r\nthat being a good pretext to question George closely regarding Texas\r\nPacific matters. Mr. Holman had invested all his ready money in San\r\nDiego, placing implicit faith in the fact that the building of the Texas\r\nPacific was a measure of national importance so manifest that Congress\r\nwould never have the hardihood to deny it assistance, nor would be so\r\nlacking in sense of honor, sense of justice, as to deprive millions of\r\nAmerican people of a railway so much needed. These had been the reasons,\r\nhe alleged, for plunging headlong into real estate speculations,\r\nfollowed closely by his friends, Don Mariano and Mr. James Mechlin.\r\n\r\nThese three gentlemen now sat at the eastern end of the veranda,\r\nlistening to what George said that he and his uncle had learned in\r\nWashington regarding the prospect of that unlucky railroad; while the\r\nladies were equally entertained, listening to Elvira and Mercedes, on\r\nthe western end of the same veranda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has become of the handsome Clarence? Why is he not here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nCorina inquired, seeing Everett and Victoriano riding up with Gabriel\r\ntowards the house.\r\n\r\nElvira informed her that on their arrival at San Francisco, Clarence\r\nfound it necessary to visit his farm, and thence to go to Arizona on\r\nbusiness, but would return about the first of July.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe heard that his mine is in bonanza,\xe2\x80\x9d Amelia said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat it has been in bonanza ever since he bought it\xe2\x80\x94hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he told you\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x9d Corina added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he only said that the ore was very rich,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira replied.\r\n\r\nVictoriano and Everett now came in and took seats near the ladies.\r\nGabriel joined the gentlemen, and soon was deeply interested in their\r\nconversation, it of course being upon that subject\xe2\x80\x94the railroad\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nfilled the minds and hearts of all the San Diego people, absorbing all\r\ntheir faculties and all their money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are all the ladies of your family? Well?\xe2\x80\x9d Amelia asked of Everett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank you. They are all well, and I think they will be up this\r\nevening\xe2\x80\x94at least, some of them will. I heard words to that effect,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEverett replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope all will come,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Mr. Darrell, senior, also?\xe2\x80\x9d Corina asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Why not?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were speaking of the ladies\xe2\x80\x94but if Mr. Darrell should call, we will\r\nbe happy to receive him with sincere cordiality,\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of which would be thrown away upon the stiffest neck in San Diego\r\nCounty,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano observed.\r\n\r\nEverett laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Tano! What makes you talk like that?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes exclaimed,\r\nreddening with evident annoyance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause his \xe2\x80\x98_butt-headedness_\xe2\x80\x99 is like that of a vicious old mule,\r\nwhich no one began to break until he was ten years old, and loves to\r\nkick from pure cussedness,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano explained, with free use of\r\nslang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Darrell has said or done anything to vex you, the best thing is\r\nnot to go to his house, but it is not very courteous to speak as you\r\nhave in the presence of his son,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI forgive him,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett said, patting Tano on the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot go to his house!\xe2\x80\x9d Tano exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly what the old\r\npirate wants. It would be _nuts_ for the old Turk if I stayed away. Not\r\nmuch\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t stay away. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go when he is at _the colony_ with his\r\nsweetly-scented pets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the colony?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the new name for the large room next to the dining-room, which\r\nClarence said he built for a \xe2\x80\x98growlery.\xe2\x80\x99 Alice called it the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_squattery_,\xe2\x80\x99 because father always receives the settlers there; but\r\nmother changed the name to \xe2\x80\x98_colony_\xe2\x80\x99 to make it less offensive, and\r\nbecause the talk there is always about locating, or surveying, or\r\nfencing land\xe2\x80\x94always land\xe2\x80\x94as it would be in a new colony,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether he be at the colony or not, you should not go if he does not\r\nwish you to visit his house,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said to Tano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we all wish it\xe2\x80\x94my mother and every one of her children. Father\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about Tano\xe2\x80\x99s coming or not, but he is cross to all\r\nof us, and don\xe2\x80\x99t have the politeness to be more amiable in Tano\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npresence\xe2\x80\x94which, of course, is very disagreeable,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Mrs. Darrell ought to put her foot down, and have it out with\r\nthe old filibuster,\xe2\x80\x9d Tano asserted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see what he will do when Clarence comes,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett said.\r\n\r\nEverett thought as all the family did\xe2\x80\x94that Clarence, being the favorite\r\nchild of the old man, and having naturally a winning manner and great\r\namiability, combined with persuasiveness, would influence his father,\r\nand dispel his bad humor. But if the family had known what was boiling\r\nand seething in the cauldron of their father\xe2\x80\x99s mind, they would have\r\nperceived that, for once, neither Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s influence, nor yet the more\r\npowerful one wielded by Mrs. Darrell, would at present be as effective\r\nas they heretofore had been.\r\n\r\nTime alone must be the agent to operate on that hard skull. Time and\r\ncircumstances which, fortunately, no one as yet was misanthrophic enough\r\nto foresee. The fact was, that no one of his family had understood\r\nWilliam Darrell. It can hardly be said that he understood himself, for\r\nhe sincerely believed that he had forever renounced his \xe2\x80\x9c_squatting_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npropensities, and honestly promised his wife that he would not take up\r\nland claimed by any one else. But no sooner was he surrounded by men\r\nwho, though his inferiors, talked loudly in assertion of their \xe2\x80\x9c_rights\r\nunder the law_;\xe2\x80\x9d and no sooner had he thousands of broad acres before\r\nhis eyes\xe2\x80\x94acres which, by obeying the laws of Congress, he could make his\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94than he again felt within him the old squatter of Sonoma and Napa\r\nvalleys. That mischievous squatter had not lain dead therein; he had\r\nbeen slumbering only, and unconsciously dreaming of the advantages that\r\nthe law really gave to settlers. Alongside the sleeping squatter had\r\nalso slumbered Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s vanity, and this was, as it is generally in\r\nevery man, the strongest quality of his mind, the chief commanding\r\ntrait, before which everything must give way.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrell had heretofore been the only will that had dared stand\r\nbefore it, but Mrs. Darrell, being a wise little woman, not always made\r\ndirect assaults upon the strong citadel\xe2\x80\x94oftener she made flank movements\r\nand laid sieges. This time, however, all tactics had thus far failed,\r\nand Mrs. Darrell withdrew all her forces, and waited, in \xe2\x80\x9cmasterly\r\ninactivity,\xe2\x80\x9d reinforcements when Clarence returned.\r\n\r\nWhat exasperated Darrell the most, and had ended by putting him in a bad\r\nhumor, was a lurking self-reproach he could not silence, a consciousness\r\nthat having promised Don Mariano to pay for his land whenever the title\r\nwas considered settled, that it was fair to suppose he ought to pay now.\r\nBut on the other hand, he had also promised the settlers to stand by\r\nthem, and was determined to do so. Thus he stood in his own mind\r\nself-accused, unhappy and unrepentant, but resolutely upholding a lost\r\ncause. He avoided the society of his family with absurd persistency.\r\nAfter meals he would fill his pipe, and march himself off to the farther\r\nend of his grain fields; resting his elbows on the fence boards, and\r\nturning his back upon the house which contained his dissenting family,\r\nwould puff his smoke in high dudgeon, like an overturned locomotive\r\nwhich had run off its track, and became hopelessly ditched. In that\r\nframe of mind, he thought himself ready to do battle against all his\r\nfamily, but he knew he dreaded Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nHowever, that event had at last arrived, and there was Clarence now on\r\nthe porch\xe2\x80\x94just come from Arizona\xe2\x80\x94kissing all the ladies of the family\r\nand hugging all the males, not omitting the old man, who was literally\r\nas well as figuratively taken off his feet by the strong arms of the\r\ndreaded Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClary is so much in love, father, that he comes courting you, too,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEverett said, laughing, as they all went into the parlor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell answered, not looking at any one\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nexcepting that of the clock on the chimney mantel.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrel\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, however, were not in the least evasive\xe2\x80\x94they met\r\nthose of Clarence, and he read in them a volume of what was troubling\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He longed to have a talk with that true-hearted and\r\nclear-headed, well-beloved mother, but he must wait\xe2\x80\x94for now came Tisha\r\nto announce that luncheon was on the table. She was grinning with\r\ndelight to see her favorite Massa Clary again, and Clarence jumped up\r\nand ran to throw his arms around her, making that faithful heart throb\r\nwith unalloyed happiness, for she loved him from his babyhood, just if\r\nhe had been her own child.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI love them all, missis\xe2\x80\x94all your dear children,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say to Mrs.\r\nDarrell; \xe2\x80\x9cand they are all good children; but Massa Clary I love the\r\nbest of all. Next comes Miss Alice. But Massa Clary took my heart when\r\nhe was six months old, and had the measles. He was the best, sweetest\r\nbaby I ever saw, and so beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus Tisha would run on, if you let\r\nher follow the bent of her inclination, for Clarence was a theme she\r\nnever tired of.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of questions now showered upon Clarence about New York, about\r\nWashington, about San Francisco, and about Arizona\xe2\x80\x94all of which he\r\nanswered most amiably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are the Mechlins very grand? As rich as one might suppose? hearing\r\nthe Holman and Alamar girls talk of the parties and excursions that Mr.\r\nLawrence Mechlin gave in honor of Elvira?\xe2\x80\x9d Jane asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe excursion to West Point was to celebrate Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 birthday,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the Mechlins must be rich, to judge by their style of living.\r\nTheir social position is certainly very high,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had a delightful time, Clary?\xe2\x80\x9d Everett said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed; most delightful,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe, too, have had lots of fun, with old Mathews on the rampage, like an\r\nold hen who got wet and lost her only chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willie, at the top\r\nof his voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWillie!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell said, to impose silence, but as Clarence and\r\nEverett laughed, and his father did not seem particularly displeased,\r\nWillie added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the old man gets so mad, that he perspires, and smoke comes out of\r\nhis back, as if his clothes were on fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Willie! how you exaggerate,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t. He snorts and clucks and growls and snarls. Romeo says he\r\nmiauls like a disappointed hyena.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat will do. You must not repeat such unkind criticisms. Romeo is\r\nalways ridiculing Mr. Mathews,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld Mathews is in worse humor since the Don began to send his cattle\r\naway,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they made nice targets for his rifle,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScandalous!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe threatens to shoot George Mechlin, Tom Hughes says,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he got the appeal dismissed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Webster.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is foolish to suppose that if George hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had it dismissed that no\r\none else would,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI met the old man this morning. He stopped his wagon to ask me if\r\nfather knew that Congress had passed the appropriation for money to\r\nsurvey lands in California. I told him I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard, and he went off\r\nwhipping his horses, and swearing at Don Mariano and George Mechlin,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEverett said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought there would be a better feeling when the Don\xe2\x80\x99s cattle should\r\nbe sent off, as they were the principal cause of irritation,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is so. Only those boys\xe2\x80\x94Romeo, Tom and Jack Miller\xe2\x80\x94are always\r\nridiculing or teasing Mathews,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, father!\xe2\x80\x9d Everett exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cthe fathers of those boys are as bad\r\nas Mathews, and old Gasbang is worse yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGasbang was always dishonest, but he is worse now, at Peter Roper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninstigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGasbang says that he and Roper will send the Don to the poor-house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEverett said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot while I live,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied; adding, \xe2\x80\x9cand how is everybody at\r\nthe Alamar house\xe2\x80\x94all well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp started Willie and Clementine, eager to be the first to tell Clarence\r\nthe great news.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had two arrivals,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clary! you never saw prettier babies in all your life! Both have\r\nthe loveliest blue eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d Clementine exclaimed, joining her hands, as if\r\nin prayer, as Tisha always did when speaking of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s babyhood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boy has gray eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d Willie interposed, with authority not to be\r\ncontroverted. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t no blue eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know? You haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen them, but _I_ have,\xe2\x80\x9d Clementine\r\nasserted; \xe2\x80\x9cand the little girl is exactly the image of Miss Mercedes.\r\nShe has Miss Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 blue eyes, exactly, with long, curling lashes,\r\nthe little thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe girl looks like Don Gabriel, as she ought to,\xe2\x80\x9d Willie stated in a\r\nperemptory manner, not to be contradicted, and whilst he discussed with\r\nClementine the looks of the babies, Clarence was informed by his mother\r\nand sisters that Elvira was the happy mother of a big, handsome boy, and\r\nLizzie rejoiced in the possession of a beautiful little girl, which\r\nweighed nearly as much as her boy cousin. That Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa and Mrs.\r\nBeatrice Mechlin were nearly crazy with happiness, but that the craziest\r\nof all was Mr. James Mechlin, who made more \xe2\x80\x9c_fuss_\xe2\x80\x9d over those two\r\nbabies than either Gabriel or George, and went from one house to the\r\nother all day long, watching each baby, and talking about them by the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\xe2\x80\x94_The Brewers of Mischief._\r\n\r\n\r\nEight delicious weeks passed\xe2\x80\x94the most delightful that Clarence and\r\nMercedes had ever lived. The first of September had dawned, and on the\r\n16th they would be married. With the first rays of the coming morn,\r\nClarence arose and went to the west window of his chamber, which looked\r\ntowards the Alamar House. As he peeped through the closed shutters,\r\nthinking it would seem foolish to open them so early, he saw the\r\nshutters of one window\xe2\x80\x94in that well known row where Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 room was\r\nlocated, and which looked to the east\xe2\x80\x94pushed open, and a white hand and\r\npart of a white arm came out and fastened it back. His heart told him\r\nwhose white arm that was, and of course he could not think of going back\r\nto bed. He began to dress himself, deliberating whether he should or not\r\ngo to town that day and telegraph to Hubert to do as he thought best\r\nabout selling another cargo of ores, or say to wait for him, that he\r\nwould be at San Francisco on the 20th. When he was dressed, he sat by\r\nthe west window and tried to read, but that white arm would come across\r\nthe page and that white hand would cover the letters, so that he threw\r\nthe book down and began to walk, trying to think about that business of\r\nselling the ore to the Austrian house, of which Hubert had been writing\r\nto him. Yes, he thought, the best thing would be to go to town that same\r\nday and ask Hubert couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the matter wait until the 20th. But should\r\nHubert be coming, or should it be necessary to wait for telegrams, he\r\nmight not be back until the following day in the evening. He would go\r\nimmediately after breakfast to tell Mercedes that he could not see her\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\nMercedes and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa were on the front piazza when he arrived, and\r\nGabriel was talking to George in quite an excited manner, for him, as he\r\nwas always so calm and self-contained. As soon as Clarence came up the\r\npiazza steps, George began to tell him that some of the last lot of\r\ncattle which had been sent off to the mountains, had got away from the\r\nherders and returned to the rancho on the previous day, and that morning\r\na couple of cows of a very choice breed were found shot through the\r\nbody, in a dying condition. The poor brutes had to be shot dead by\r\nGabriel himself, to save them from further suffering. No one knew who\r\nhad fired on the poor dumb animals, but circumstantial evidence clearly\r\npointed to Old Mathews.\r\n\r\nClarence was very angry, of course. He reflected in silence for a few\r\nmoments, then said to Gabriel:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think if Don Mariano would make now, to-day, a deed of sale of _all_\r\nhis cattle and horses to me, they would have a better chance of being\r\nspared. Not that Mathews, or Gasbang, or Miller like me any better, but\r\nthey are not so anxious to annoy me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s idea is a good one,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, too, and have thought so for some time,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel replied.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to drive off the last lot to-day. Father and Tano are down\r\nin the valley. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him what you say as soon as I go down. I think\r\nwe will return by to-morrow night, and he can draw up the deed then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him that I shall consider that the cattle are mine _now_, and will\r\nlet our friends, the settlers, know it, so that they can have the\r\nsatisfaction of killing _my cattle_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you really mean it?\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Don Mariano can buy all the cattle he wants to restock his\r\nrancho after he gets rid of the two-legged animals,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, if he wants to restock it. He was talking with George and me\r\nlast night, and he said if the Texas Pacific is built, he will have all\r\nhis land surveyed to sell it in farming lots, and will not put cattle in\r\nit. But if the railroad is not built, then the best use he can make of\r\nthe rancho will be to make it a cattle rancho again, after the squatters\r\ngo away,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said, adding that he must be going to join his father.\r\nHe then went into the hall to go to the court-yard, where his saddled\r\nhorse and his _vaquero_ waited for him. Clarence and George followed to\r\nbid him good-by. Clarence said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to Hubert about procuring for you a place at a bank, to get\r\nbroken into the banking business, and he replied that he can, and will\r\nget you a place. Would you like to try it, now that you will have less\r\nto do here, when there will be no cattle at the rancho? I am going to\r\nwrite and telegraph to Hubert to-day\xe2\x80\x94or he might be down in to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsteamer\xe2\x80\x94so that I can tell him about what time you might go up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you had better go about the time Clarence and Mercedes get\r\nmarried, as they will immediately go to their house in San Francisco,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nGeorge suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think that will be the best time,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to Hubert that we will be up by the 20th of this\r\nmonth,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGabriel can take his place on the 1st of October. That will do\r\nsplendidly, as Lizzie and Mercedes will be together,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must live in the hope that we will all come down to make our\r\nhomes here,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. That is understood,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough at times I feel discouraged, still, I can\xe2\x80\x99t well see how the\r\nTexas Pacific is to be defeated permanently. That would be too\r\noutrageous. Let us hope that by next year our banking scheme will be\r\ncarried out,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, and as I have made more money than I had when we first\r\ntalked about it we can put in more capital. We can, if you advise it,\r\nput in a whole million now,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, and both shook hands with Gabriel,\r\nwho quickly jumped on his horse and was off at a gallop, followed by his\r\n_vaquero_.\r\n\r\nIt was the hour when the babies got their morning bath. George had great\r\npleasure in seeing his boy enjoy the sensation of floating in the water;\r\nso he let Clarence return to the porch where Mercedes was now alone, and\r\nhe went to watch the bathing of his boy.\r\n\r\nClarence sat close to Mercedes and said: \xe2\x80\x9cDoes the sweetest thing that\r\nGod created realize that this day is the first day of September?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean me, though you make me feel very foolish with your\r\nexaggerated praise, I must say that I do realize that to-day is the\r\nfirst of September,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does the loveliest rosebud and the prettiest hummingbird remember\r\nthat in two weeks more she is to be mine, mine forever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHush, Clarence, some one might hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, putting her hand\r\nover his lips, blushing and looking around, alarmed. He took that hand\r\nand kissed the palm of it, then turned it over and kissed the back of it\r\nmost ardently, and held it in his own, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have a piece of information that is going to make your dear heart\r\nglad. What will you give for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? Do tell me. Is it about papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but it is about Gabriel and Lizzie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Gabriel will get a place at a San Francisco bank to learn the\r\nbanking business, and they will live with us, so you and Lizzie will be\r\ntogether.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Clarence, is that so? Oh! you make me so glad! How can I ever thank\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you said that you love me? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you promised to marry me,\r\nand thus make me the happiest man upon the entire face of all this\r\nearth? That is enough for thanks. But for telling you the news I want to\r\nbe paid _extra_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes blushed crimson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to town now, to be away a long time; won\xe2\x80\x99t you give me one\r\nsingle kiss to say good-by?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMust you go? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you write your letters or telegrams and send\r\nthem from here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I may have to answer some dispatches immediately. Or it is\r\npossible that Hubert might have run down to see me for a few hours.\r\nTo-morrow is steamer day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen this will be a good chance to send up your photograph I want to\r\nhave enlarged and painted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; give it to me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going to the parlor. He followed her. He\r\nclosed the door, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, one sweet kiss to give me good luck and bring me back all safe.\r\nP-l-e-a-s-e don\xe2\x80\x99t refuse it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clarence! Mamma don\xe2\x80\x99t approve of such things, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t either.\r\nYou are not my husband yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, but in vain, for he had put\r\nhis arm around her and was holding her close to his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not your husband yet? Yes I am. In intention I have been ever\r\nsince January, 1872. More than two years, and, in fact, I shall be in\r\ntwo weeks. So you see how cruel it is to be so distant.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you call this distant, holding me so close?\xe2\x80\x9d For sole answer he\r\nlooked into her eyes, kissed her forehead and blushing cheeks, then he\r\nkissed the heavily fringed eyelids, kept partly closed, afraid to meet\r\nthe radiant gaze of his expressive eyes. Then he put his lips to hers\r\nand held them there in a long kiss of the purest, truest love. \xe2\x80\x9cMy\r\ndarling! My wife! My own for ever! The sweetest, loveliest angel of my\r\nsoul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo doubt he would have been willing to hold her thus close to his heart\r\nfor hours, but she disengaged herself from his embrace with gentle\r\nfirmness. Such warm caresses she intuitively felt must be improper in\r\nthe highest degree, even on the eve of marriage. No lady could allow\r\nthem without surrendering her dignity. That was the effect of Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa\xe2\x80\x99s doctrines, which she had carefully inculcated into the minds of\r\nher daughters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope that at last you have kissed me enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes,\r\nrather resentfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever enough, but I hope sufficiently to give me good luck,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\nthe happy Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clarence, that reminds me of my horrible dream of last night. I\r\ndreamed that papa went to look for you in the midst of a snow storm and\r\nnever came back. You returned, but he never did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must not believe in dreams, dearest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not, but this seemed prophetic to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProphetic of a snow storm in San Diego?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe snow was symbolic of bereavement, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe rested her head on his shoulder and seemed lost in thought, and he\r\nheld the little hand, so soft and white and well shaped, and thought of\r\nher beauty and lovely qualities and his coming happiness. He was\r\nthinking that he would have been content to pass the day thus, when she\r\nraised her eyes to his, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must not keep you if you must go. Remember how superstitious my dream\r\nhas made me. I wish you could wait until to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would, but Hubert might come to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten that.\xe2\x80\x9d One more long kiss and they parted, her heart\r\nsinking under a load of undefined terrors.\r\n\r\nFrom the seventh heaven Clarence had to come down again to prosaic\r\nearth; and after bidding adieu to Mercedes, he drove back home to speak\r\nto his father. The old man was sitting in his easy chair on the porch,\r\nsmoking his pipe, alone, behind the curtain of honeysuckle, white\r\njasmine and roses, so carefully trained over the porch by Mrs. Darrell\r\nand Alice. Seeing his son driving back towards the front steps, he\r\nwalked down to meet him. Clarence was glad that he seemed in a better\r\nhumor. He at once said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I came back to ask a favor of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA favor? You alarm me. You never did that in all your life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean I never did anything else. I know it. But this is a very\r\nespecial one, and a business favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hear it. Of course I\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything I can for you or any other\r\nof my children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, father. The favor is this. That in talking with the\r\nsettlers\xe2\x80\x94especially those who have been most ready to shoot the Don\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncattle\xe2\x80\x94that you tell them I have bought all his stock and all will be\r\ndriven to the Colorado river just as soon as cold weather sets in. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think many of the settlers like me any better than they like the\r\nDon, but if they think they might displease _you_ by killing your son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncattle they might spare the poor animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. I expect Mathews and Miller now. They sent me word they are\r\ncoming to bring me some special news as soon as Gasbang returns from\r\ntown. But have you really and truly bought the stock? or is it only to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have made a bona fide purchase; five hundred head are already at the\r\nmine, and as soon as the hot weather is over, the others will follow. I\r\nmust buy cattle somewhere, for we have to feed five hundred men now at\r\nwork, and as the Don is losing his all the time, I proposed to him to\r\nsell all to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is he to do with his land? Queer that he should sell his\r\ncattle when he gets his land. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he believe he\xe2\x80\x99ll get rid of us\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n_squatters_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, but he figures thus: If the Texas Pacific is built, it will pay\r\nbetter to sell his land in farming lots; if not, he can restock it when\r\nhe gets rid of his troublesome neighbors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has more sense than I gave him credit for. I guess you put him up to\r\nthat dodge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed. He thought it himself, but it seems that Gabriel and George\r\nthought the same thing at the same time, and as I was thinking where I\r\ncould get cattle for my mines, it struck me I might buy his and suit us\r\nboth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to the settlers, but of course I cannot promise\r\nthat they will do what I ask.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand that. Many thanks. Good-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen will you return?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d and he was off at a tearing speed for his horses were tired\r\nof waiting, and longed to be on the road.\r\n\r\nThere was a little _arroyo_ which passed about 500 yards on the west of\r\nDon Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s house and marked the west line of Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s land; as\r\nClarence approached this dried brook, he saw Gasbang and Roper coming\r\ndown from the opposite hill, evidently unable to check their horses.\r\nRoper was so intoxicated that he could with difficulty keep his seat,\r\nand as Gasbang seemed much frightened, Clarence took his ph\xc3\xa6ton well off\r\nthe road and waited so as to lend his assistance, if it should be\r\nrequired. But \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind Providence which takes care of drunken sailors,\r\nchildren and the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d was watchful of Roper, and though he\r\nswayed and swung beyond possible equilibrium, he stuck to his seat with\r\ndrunken gravity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing to invest in more real estate?\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang shouted as soon as he\r\nfelt reassured by passing the great danger of sand and pebbles which his\r\ncowardice had magnified to him into a precipice. Roper laughed heartily,\r\nbut Clarence, not understanding the allusion, made no answer and drove\r\non without looking at them. If a kind fairy could have whispered to him\r\nwhat was the errand of these two men, he most assuredly would have\r\nturned back. There being no fairy but the blue-eyed one who had already\r\ntold her dreams and fears, which he had not believed, he went on to\r\ntown, and Gasbang took Roper to his house, carefully putting him to bed\r\nto take a nap that would sober him before he spoke with Darrell; for it\r\nwas to speak with Darrell that he came.\r\n\r\nWhile Roper slept, Gasbang went to see Mathews, Miller and Hughes, and\r\ntogether they held a consultation, at the end of which it was decided\r\nthat, as Roper was too intoxicated yet, and Darrell disliked drunkards,\r\nthey would go and have a preliminary talk with him themselves, and Roper\r\nwould be pressed into service, if advisable, in the morning, when he\r\nwould be sober.\r\n\r\nDarrell had got tired of waiting for Mathews; so, after thinking of what\r\nClarence had said, he decided that it would be better to have a talk\r\nwith Hancock and Pitikin, who were about the most reliable of all the\r\nsettlers. They perhaps knew what it was that Mathews had to say. He told\r\nWebster to saddle a horse and bring it around; he would go on horseback,\r\nas the wagon road to Hancock\xe2\x80\x99s was very long, around the fields.\r\n\r\nBut now when Webster had brought the saddled horse to the front steps,\r\nDarrell saw Mathews, Gasbang, Miller and Hughes coming in a two-seated\r\nwagon, and all seemed to be talking very excitedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTie the horse there. I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for those men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, sitting\r\ndown again. Webster did as he was told, and then walked straight\r\nup-stairs to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s room. Everett and Alice were with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother, if I were you, I would go and sit in the parlor and do my\r\nsewing there by the windows on the piazza, while those bad men are\r\ntalking to father,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Webster, go and listen unseen!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, and do it quickly, for those old imps mean mischief to\r\nClarence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Clarence!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Alice and her mother at the same time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mother, Web. might be right. You might just be in time to unmask\r\nsome lie against Clary,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing is sure, that those men already have too much influence over\r\nfather, and we have done nothing to oppose it,\xe2\x80\x9d Alice said. Mrs. Darrell\r\nwas silent, then, looking at her children, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might be right, my children, but that would not justify my\r\nlistening at the keyhole.\xe2\x80\x9d Everett shrugged his shoulders, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, mother. Come on, Web.\xe2\x80\x9d And both boys left the room. When\r\nthey were out, Everett said: \xe2\x80\x9cWeb, get a horse saddled and tie him at\r\nthe back porch for me. I am going to listen from Jane\xe2\x80\x99s room; one of her\r\nwindows is right over those men. If what I hear makes it necessary for\r\nme to see Clarence, I shall go to town. Get a horse saddled immediately\r\nand come to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\xe2\x80\x94_The Squatter and the Don._\r\n\r\n\r\nEverett found Lucy in Jane\xe2\x80\x99s room. Both were sewing by the window he\r\nwanted. He squeezed himself into a seat between his sisters, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirls, I want to hear. Hush! Listen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVoices were heard below. All listened. As Webster was coming down stairs\r\nhe saw John Gasbang going out at the other end of the parlor, pushing a\r\nlarge arm-chair out upon the porch. He heard them laughing at some of\r\nGasbang\xe2\x80\x99s coarse, vulgar jokes, and then all sat down. After some\r\ndesultory talk, Mathews, evidently anxious to begin at what they had to\r\nstate, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid, neighbor Darrell, that somebody has been fooling you and\r\nlaughing at you, or if not, then the thing will look as if _you\r\nyourself_ had been fooling us and laughing at us. This we can hardly\r\nbelieve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t believe at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes explained, seeing Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s brow\r\ndarken.\r\n\r\nJane\xe2\x80\x99s window was possessed of most favorable acoustic qualities. Every\r\nword could be distinctly heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d says Darrell, gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not given to\r\njoking or laughing much, and I never knew that anybody dared to laugh at\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely!\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes exclaimed, bowing deferentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever give us to understand that this land you occupy you had\r\nbought and paid for?\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I said to the Don I would pay when the title is settled; that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall. You all heard that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you never paid him any money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a red cent. But see here, what do you mean by coming here to\r\ncatechise _me_? You don\xe2\x80\x99t know William Darrell, if you think you can set\r\na trap for him in this way. I tell you he would kick your trap to the\r\nold \xe2\x80\x98Nick\xe2\x80\x99 in two minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said, getting white with anger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said, shaking with laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop your nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said to him; then to Mathews, \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak out\r\nlike a man\xe2\x80\x94what is it all about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat we are told that it is recorded that you paid six thousand four\r\nhundred dollars to the Don for six hundred and forty acres of land,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMiller explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did I do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked, with increasing pallor, the sight\r\nof which his interlocutor did not relish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the 13th day of February, 1872,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho saw the record?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did. I saw the entry made by the notary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the notary lies, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. He could be prosecuted for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Miller said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, he shall be; for it is a lie that I bought any such land or\r\npaid any such price for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the Don had the entry made,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the Don lied, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him so,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell retorted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that Mr. Clarence did not buy the land unbeknown to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMathews asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, sir? Do you mean to say that my own son would put me\r\nin such a ridiculous position? No, I think it is more likely that, as\r\nHughes says, the Don had the false entry made on the strength of my\r\nhaving promised to pay him for the land I would take. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll teach him\r\nthat I am not to be dragged into a bargain like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would the Don gain by that? Nothing. No, if you will not be\r\noffended, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I heard is the most likely theory of it\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who in the devil has been building theories on my affairs? I\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nto see the fellow who does that,\xe2\x80\x9d thundered Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was my lawyer, who casually discovered that entry in the notary\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks, and told me of it. He meant no harm,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang explained, with\r\nconciliatory amiability.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he meant no harm. Lawyers of the Peter Roper stamp never do.\r\nWhen they go sticking their noses into people\xe2\x80\x99s business, they do so\r\n_casually_. And your lawyer\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Roper, I suppose\xe2\x80\x94being a very innocent\r\nand straightforward and honorable, high-toned man, who never gets drunk,\r\nhe did not mean any harm, and _accidentally_, purely so, made this\r\ndiscovery, and no danger of his having been too drunk to read straight,\r\neither. Look here, John, don\xe2\x80\x99t you talk to me as if you thought me\r\nidiotic, for I am not. But what is this innocent theory of this\r\nunsophisticated, honorable Peter Roper? Let us see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he thinks that Mr. Clarence being in love with the Don\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, probably bought the land to propitiate the family, and dated\r\nback the deed of sale,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said.\r\n\r\nDarrell was silent, but shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, the Don could have had no object in putting on record that he\r\nhad received six thousand four hundred dollars, unless he did so,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMiller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think he received the money?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt of it,\xe2\x80\x9d all the others answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes, and all could see the Don riding\r\ntowards home, accompanied by his two sons. Behind them the _vaqueros_\r\nwere driving a lot of cattle towards the \xe2\x80\x9c_corral_\xe2\x80\x9d at the back of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nSeeing the cattle, Darrell said: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, these cattle now belong to\r\nClarence. He bought every head on this rancho belonging to the Don, and\r\nwill drive them to the Colorado River as soon as the weather cools off.\r\nSo I hope that if any stray cows or calves come up to your places you\r\nwill corral them and send _me_ word. I ask this of all of you, as a\r\nfavor to me, not to Clarence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly! certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes, Miller and Gasbang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it be too much trouble to do that?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked Mathews, who had\r\nremained silent.\r\n\r\nHe was compelled to reply: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not\xe2\x80\x94not for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, I ask only what the law gives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Clarence knows that if his cattle go to your fields you must corral\r\nthem and give him notice. And now I want to go and speak with the Don.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll arose.\r\n\r\nHughes said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs we all wish to know more about that land sale, we will\r\ncome back this evening to hear what the Don says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. I am going to ask all he knows about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows everything, the greaser!\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews growled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you think Clarence paid the money?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he did, to get the girl,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed Gasbang; then added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas all a put-up job, and they kept the secret well, so we never smelled\r\nthe rat, while they laughed at us. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t care so long as you, Mr.\r\nDarrell, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo says I,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miller.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughes, and they drove off, laughing.\r\n\r\nDarrell remained standing on the front steps. He ground his teeth and\r\nclenched his fists as he heard the laughter from the wagon, which\r\nsounded louder as the wagon went further away. He walked to the stable\r\nand took a heavy whip, one of those which teamsters call \xe2\x80\x9cblack snakes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich are used to drive mules with. The old man trembled with suppressed\r\nanger, so much that he could not fasten on his spurs, and this only\r\nincreased the more his senseless rage.\r\n\r\nEverett was scarcely less angry or less pale. He was waiting for his\r\nfather to start, to follow him. Webster came up-stairs and said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetty, father means mischief. He has a \xe2\x80\x98black snake,\xe2\x80\x99 and trembles with\r\nrage as if he had the ague.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor father, how unfortunate it is that he got into such a wrong train\r\nof reasoning,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is bound to keep wrong as long as he permits such men to influence\r\nhim. I am ashamed of father,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d Jane begged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucy maintained; \xe2\x80\x9cvery much ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I also\xe2\x80\x94bitterly ashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett said.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman at last succeeded in fastening his spurs and getting\r\non his horse. He trotted off to meet the Don. Everett and Webster went\r\ndown stairs. Webster had saddled two horses; he was not going to let\r\nEverett go alone, when he might need help. So the two boys followed\r\ntheir father at a short distance.\r\n\r\nLucy and Jane went to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s room, from which they had a better view\r\nof that part of the valley through which passed the main road, in front\r\nof the Alamar house. They saw their father take the main road. The Don\r\nwas coming slowly with his two sons, watching the _vaqueros_ driving the\r\ncattle up the hill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, see father going to meet the Don. What does he mean?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\nAlice, alarmed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrell went to the window, and both sat there to watch\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nTwo or three head of cattle got separated, and Gabriel turned back at a\r\nfew paces to head them off. Don Mariano and Victoriano kept on, and soon\r\nafter met Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood afternoon, Mr. Darrell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, pleasantly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see we\r\nare Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s _vaqueros_ now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDarrell muttered something gruffly, and stopped his horse in the middle\r\nof the road. The others did the same. Don Mariano saw that Darrell was\r\nvery angry, and waited for him to speak first.\r\n\r\nThe enraged man gasped twice, but no sound came. On the third effort his\r\nharsh tones said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want you to tell me what is all this trickery and lies about my\r\nhaving paid you six thousand four hundred dollars for land. You know\r\nthat to be a lie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do. You never paid me a cent, nor the other settlers\r\neither. No settler wants to pay, and I never said you had, or expected\r\nthey would, for I know they believe themselves authorized by law to\r\nappropriate my property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t Clarence pay you for the land I took?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Mr. Darrell, business matters between Clarence and myself\r\nare not to be mentioned, and unless he authorizes me to speak I cannot\r\nrepeat anything which he wishes to keep quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have some private business together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano bowed, but did not speak. Darrell came closer to the Don,\r\nand shaking at him the fist in which he held the whip, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I tell you, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to be bargaining\r\nwith my son in a clandestine manner, fooling me, and making me appear\r\nridiculous. But I tell you to your face\xe2\x80\x94for I am not a sneaking coward\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ntell you, that you have acted most dishonorably, inveigling Clarence\r\ninto bargains unbeknown to me, inducing him, with seductive bribes, to\r\nact most dishonorably towards me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were those bribes?\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were they? Your daughter\xe2\x80\x99s pretty looks, by G\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Everett, turning very pale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw! That is too low,\xe2\x80\x9d the Don said, turning his horse towards his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nDarrell spurred his and stood in the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo low, you say? And isn\xe2\x80\x99t it low to act as you have? And now you want\r\nto sneak off like a coward, and not give me any satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready to give you any satisfaction you want, but demand it like a\r\ngentleman. I am no Peter Roper, or Gasbang, or Billy Mathews, to have a\r\ntumble-down fist-fight in the dirt with you. If you forget your dignity,\r\nI do not,\xe2\x80\x9d the Don replied, again trying to go towards his house.\r\n\r\nDarrell again placed his horse in front to intercept his road, and said,\r\nlivid with rage:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you think of your dignity when you paraded your daughter\r\n(like a pretty filly for sale) before my son, to get his money! Damn\r\nyou! can\xe2\x80\x99t I make you fight? Won\xe2\x80\x99t you be insulted, you coward? I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\npublish your cowardice all over California.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, he lifted his whip and struck a severe blow at the Don.\r\nQuickly, at the same instant, Victoriano and Everett had dashed their\r\nhorses between, and the blow fell right upon the backs of the two young\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThis act of devotion was scarcely necessary, for as Darrell lifted his\r\nwhip, and before it fell down, Don Mariano touched his horse with one\r\nspur only, giving a quick touch to the reins to one side. The horse\r\njumped aside, sat on his haunches for an instant, half-crouching,\r\nhalf-rearing, and in a second he was up again. Don Mariano smiled at\r\nDarrell\xe2\x80\x99s clumsy horsemanship, conscious of being able to ride him down\r\nand all around him before the belligerent squatter could tell what was\r\nhappening. Still smiling, the Don rode slowly away. Darrell followed\r\nclose, and again lifted his whip to strike, but instantaneously he felt\r\nas if he had been struck by lightning, or as if an aerolite had fallen\r\nupon him. His arm fell powerless by his side, and an iron hoop seemed to\r\nencircle him. He looked down to his breast surprised, and there the coil\r\nof a _reata_ held him in an iron grip, and he could not move. He looked\r\nabout him amazed, and saw that the other end of the _reata_ was neatly\r\nwound around the pommel of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s saddle, and that young gentleman\r\nsat quietly on his horse, as if waiting Mr. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s orders to move,\r\nhis handsome face a little pale, but quite composed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo home and bring me my pistols, Webster. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fix this brood of\r\ngreasers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, half choked with rage and the tight embrace of\r\nthe _reata_.\r\n\r\nWebster hesitated, and looked towards his brother for advice. Everett\r\nwinked, and Webster understood at once that Everett meant that he should\r\ngo, but bring no pistols. He galloped off towards home.\r\n\r\nThe horse that Darrell was riding was the mate of the one that Webster\r\nrode, so that when he saw his partner go off towards home, he thought he\r\nmust do the same, and followed. As the reins hung loosely upon his neck,\r\nhe naturally supposed that he was to follow at the pace his companion\r\nwent, so he started at a gallop to catch up with Webster.\r\n\r\nThus now began a most ridiculous steeple-chase going home. Darrell could\r\nnot check his horse or do anything but hold to the pommel of his saddle,\r\nhis arms being pinioned to his body. Gabriel, fearing to let go the\r\n_reata_, which, if loosened, might entangle the horse, and thus pull the\r\nold man off his saddle, followed, maintaining the _reata_ at an even,\r\ngentle tension, carefully keeping at the same distance. Victoriano and\r\nEverett saw nothing to do but follow, trying to get near Darrell to\r\ncatch him in case he should lose his balance going over the rough ground\r\nof the plowed field.\r\n\r\nThe two Indian _vaqueros_ after putting their cattle in the _corral_,\r\ncame down to inquire for further orders, and seeing the race going on,\r\nthey thought they could join in, too. So, putting spurs to their horses,\r\nthey began to run and shout in high glee. Noticing that the patron, Don\r\nGabriel, held a _reata_ in his hands, the _lazo_ end of which was\r\nattached to Darrell, they thought that for sport Don Gabriel had thrown\r\nthe _lazo_ on the old squatter. Having come to this conclusion, they\r\nbegan to shout and hurrah with renewed vigor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApa! viejo escuata \xc3\xb3 cabestreas \xc3\xb3 te \xc3\xb3rcas,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo le afloje patroncito Gabriel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\nNow the ground being very rough, Darrell began to sway, as if losing his\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cApri\xc3\xa9tate viejo! apri\xc3\xa9tate m\xc3\xadralo! ya se ladea!\xe2\x80\x9d cried again one\r\n_vaquero_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCreo que el viejo escuata va chispo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQue es eso? A que vienen ac\xc3\xa1? Quien los convida? C\xc3\xa1llense la boca, no\r\nsean malcreados, Vallense!\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, turning to them in great\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nThis rebuke and imperative order silenced them immediately, and not\r\nunderstanding why these gentlemen were having all that fun, and did not\r\nlaugh, nor wished any one else to laugh, quietly turned and went home.\r\n\r\nDarrell\xe2\x80\x99s horse now came to a hollow made by the old bed of a brook\r\nwhere the road passed diagonally. To gallop down hill was too much\r\nequestrianism for the pinioned rider; he began again to topple to one\r\nside. Quick as a flash Victoriano darted forward, and grasping the\r\nbridle with one hand, caught with the other the body of Darrell, which\r\nhaving entirely lost balance, was toppling over like a log.\r\n\r\nGabriel immediately gathering the _reata_ quickly in successive loops,\r\nall of which he hung on the pommel of his saddle, came to Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take that _lazo_ off, Mr. Darrell, if you permit me,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGabriel, very quietly, when Victoriano had straightened him on the\r\nsaddle, and he had again a perpendicular position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, damn you, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay for it, too!\xe2\x80\x9d was Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s courteous\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be abusive. Use better language; and if you want\r\nto fight I\xe2\x80\x99ll accommodate you whenever you wish, with any weapons,\r\nexcept the tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you think a _lazo_ is a very genteel weapon. It is good\r\nenough for cowardly, treacherous greasers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the irate Darrell,\r\neager to be as insulting as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to subdue wild cattle,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel added. \xe2\x80\x9cI threw my _lazo_ on you to\r\nkeep you from striking my father. He was unarmed, and you made a brutal\r\nattack upon him with a heavy mule whip. I would _lazo_ you again fifty\r\ntimes, or any other man, under the same circumstances. If you think it\r\nwas cowardly to do so, I will prove to you at any time that I was not\r\nprompted by cowardice. Victoriano, loosen the _reata_ off Mr. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictoriano dismounted, and endeavored to loosen the tight noose, but it\r\nwas so firmly drawn that he could not move it. Everett came to his\r\nassistance, but he, too, failed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot loosen the noose without hurting Mr. Darrell,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nVictoriano, giving up the task.\r\n\r\nGabriel dismounted, and examined the noose carefully. He shook his head,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir; we cannot loosen that _reata_ while you are sitting down. We\r\nwill have to put you on your feet, Mr. Darrell, and you will be slimmer\r\nthen. Thus by collapsing a little the loop will lose the tension that\r\nkeeps it tight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Mr. Darrell, Retty and I will let you down nicely,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nVictoriano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLean on me, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everett, but as he held up his arms towards\r\nhis father, he became convulsed with laughter. Victoriano was laughing,\r\ntoo, so heartily, that Darrell was afraid to trust his weight into their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor shame, Victoriano, to be so discourteous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel,\r\nreprovingly\xe2\x80\x94his handsome features perfectly serious.\r\n\r\nBut Victoriano had suppressed his desire to laugh too long, and now his\r\nrisibility was beyond control. Everett was overcome in the same manner,\r\nso that he hung on Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, shaking with ill-suppressed\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell, be not afraid to trust to my strength, I am slender, but I\r\nam stronger than I look. Lean your weight on me slowly, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nyou off your horse while those boys laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said, putting up his\r\nhands for Darrell to lean on them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we had better go home first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. It will be painful for Mrs. Darrell to see you as you are, and\r\nthen you ought to have that _reata_ off now, quickly. It will sicken\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I feel a very strange sort of cold feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel was afraid that impeded circulation might make the old man\r\nfaint, so he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mr. Darrell, quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe slipped off one stirrup, then quickly went around slipped off the\r\nother, and pulled Darrell to him gently. Down like a felled tree came\r\nthe old fighter, almost bearing Gabriel down to the ground. Everett and\r\nVictoriano, checking their laughter somewhat, lent their assistance to\r\nhold him up, and as he had begun to look bluish, they saw the necessity\r\nof establishing the old man\xe2\x80\x99s circulation. While Everett and Victoriano\r\nheld him up, Gabriel loosened the coil, rubbing briskly and hard the\r\nbenumbed arms to start circulation by friction, moving them up and down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you get on your horse now?\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel asked, after Darrell had moved\r\nhis arms several times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking towards his house. A new shadow\r\npassed over his face.\r\n\r\nWebster was coming back, leading his horse. Would he bring pistols? No.\r\nHis mother was walking with him. Mrs. Darrell saluted the Alamares, and\r\nthey lifted their hats respectfully in response. Webster had told her\r\nall that had happened, and she understood everything, excepting the\r\nsteeple-chase performance. She had seen all running behind her husband,\r\nbut she did not know that the chase was most involuntary on his part.\r\nSeeing them stop for so long a time in the hollow she thought he had\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, William? Did you fall?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. And if I had, you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick me up. What did you come out here\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d was the characteristic answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, not seeing you when down in this hollow I feared you were\r\nhurt, but since it is only foolish anger that ails you, I need not waste\r\nmy sympathy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in her sweet, low voice\xe2\x80\x94which Clarence insisted\r\nalways was like Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 voice, having that same musical vibration, so\r\npleasing to the ear and sure to go straight to the heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Darrell, allow me to assure you that all this trouble came most\r\nunexpectedly to us. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know what caused it, but no matter what the\r\ncause may be, I certainly could do nothing else than prevent anybody\r\nfrom striking my father,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Don Gabriel, you did your duty. I do not blame you\xe2\x80\x94no one of\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x94at all. Express my regrets to your father, please. I am grieved to\r\nthe heart about this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and there was a sad note in her tones,\r\nwhich plainly told that her expressions of regret were but too true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell my father what you say, and let us hope that the cause of\r\nall this misunderstanding may be explained,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, offering her hand to him, which he took and\r\npressed warmly.\r\n\r\nWhen Darrell saw that friendly demonstration, he turned his back upon\r\nall, and muttering that he was \xe2\x80\x9cto be made the scape-goat of all,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwalked home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrell then asked Gabriel to explain everything to her, which he\r\ndid, while she listened to him very attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you only had heard what those squatters said, and prevented father\r\nfrom riding out,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett exclaimed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrell sighed, shook hands with the Alamares, and, followed by her\r\nsons, walked home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\xe2\x80\x94_Mrs. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s View of Our Land Laws._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the horrible tortures that the human mind is capable of conjuring\r\nup with which to torment itself, none was greater to William Darrell\r\nthan the consciousness of being ridiculous\xe2\x80\x94the conviction that people\r\nwere laughing at him. He had seen Victoriano and his own Everett so\r\nconvulsed with laughter, laughing at him, laughing in his presence,\r\nlaughing so heartily that they could scarcely stand up. This laughter of\r\nthe two boys was the most vivid picture in the panorama of living scenes\r\nwhich he himself had evoked. Surely if his own son laughed so heartily,\r\neverybody else would do the same. And when on his return home,\r\nClementine had said to him most unceremoniously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, papa, what made you sit on your horse so stiff? Why did you want\r\nto keep that rope? You looked so funny.\xe2\x80\x9d And Clementine laughed\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet out of my way,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, and went to the \xe2\x80\x9ccolony\xe2\x80\x9d straight and\r\nbanged the door; which meant that he wanted no one else within the\r\nprecincts of that asylum. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I looked funny and stiff; they were all\r\nlaughing at me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and with a groan of mental and physical pain,\r\nflung himself on the lounge.\r\n\r\nPresently, Tisha came to say that supper was on the table. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nany supper,\xe2\x80\x9d said he in the gruff tones he used when he was angry, or\r\npretended to be. Tisha retired, but in about ten minutes she returned,\r\ncarrying a tray, which she deposited on a table, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissus says that mayhap when you rested awhile you might feel a little\r\nhungry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me a cup of tea; I want nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and Tisha fixed\r\nhis tea just as she knew he liked it with plenty of rich cream and four\r\nlumps of sugar, for Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s teacup held a pint; she placed the tea on\r\na little table by the lounge and retired.\r\n\r\nThe tea seemed to refresh him in spite of himself, and he accepted the\r\nimprovement with an inward protest as if setting down an exception (as\r\nlawyers call it) by which he renounced all obligation to be grateful.\r\n\r\nEarly the settlers began to arrive at the \xe2\x80\x9ccolony\xe2\x80\x9d through the side door\r\nof the back hall. Everett joined the meeting, as Romeo came to request\r\nhis company. Darrell gave his son a withering look, but did not speak to\r\nhim. He kept his reclining position on the lounge and his satellites sat\r\nin a semi-circle around him. He soon told them he had nothing\r\nsatisfactory to say, as the Don had refused to make any explanation,\r\nalleging that he had promised Clarence to say nothing. When Clarence\r\nreturned he would clear the mystery. The settlers again recommenced\r\ntheir conjectures, and discussed the motives which must have actuated\r\nthe Don to make a false entry, to record having received money which he\r\nnever got. Land was the discussion, but there seemed no dissenting voice\r\nas to the Don\xe2\x80\x99s culpability, and the sinister motives which actuated him\r\nin acting in that underhand manner. When the altercation was at the\r\nhighest, and could be heard all over the house, Mrs. Darrell walked in\r\nand, bowing to the astonished squatters, came slowly forward and stood\r\nabout the middle of the semi-circle, though outside of it. Darrell sat\r\nup and all the others stood on their feet and stared as if they had seen\r\nsome Banquo spectre or other terrible ghostly apparition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe seated, gentlemen, I beg of you. I have but a few words to say.\r\nPlease sit down,\xe2\x80\x9d she reiterated, seeing that every one remained\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nSlowly all one by one dropped into their seats and all the faces were\r\nturned towards her. No one thought of offering her a chair, and she did\r\nnot want one either. When all had resumed their seats, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll those amongst you, gentlemen, who think that Don Mariano Alamar\r\ninduced my son Clarence to purchase land from him are much mistaken; and\r\nall those who think Don Mariano made a false entry of a land sale, do\r\nhim an injustice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho made the entry then?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked, sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I came to say. The land was bought and paid for at _my_\r\nrequest. If there is any blame, or crime, or guilt in the matter, _I_ am\r\nthe criminal\xe2\x80\x94_I_ am the guilty one. I told my son, Clarence Darrell,\r\nthat if he did not pay for the land which his father had located, I\r\nwould never, _never_ come to live upon it. Moreover, I told my son not\r\nto mention the fact of having paid for the land, because his father\r\nwould think we were interfering in his business, and I did not wish him\r\nto know that the land was paid for until the question of the Don\xe2\x80\x99s title\r\nwas settled. Then we would have avoided painful discussions, and the\r\neloquence of facts (I trusted) would clearly show to my husband that his\r\nwife and son had acted right, when we had paid the legitimate owner for\r\nhis property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, gentlemen, let me add this, only this, that I do not mean to\r\ncriticise anybody\xe2\x80\x99s actions or opinions, but, from my point of view, I\r\nsay, those laws which authorize you to locate homesteads upon lands\r\nclaimed as Mexican grants, those laws are wrong, and good, just, moral\r\ncitizens should not be guided by them. Settlers should wait until the\r\ntitles are finally approved or rejected. See! look back and see all the\r\nmiseries that so many innocent families have suffered by locating in\r\ngood faith, their humble homes upon lands that they were forced to\r\nabandon. Our law-givers doubtless mean well, but they have\xe2\x80\x94through lack\r\nof matured reflection, I think, or lack of unbiased thought\xe2\x80\x94legislated\r\ncurses upon this land of God\xe2\x80\x99s blessings. I love my country, as every\r\ntrue-hearted American woman should, but, with shame and sorrow, I\r\nacknowledge that we have treated the conquered Spaniards most cruelly,\r\nand our law-givers have been most unjust to them. Those poor,\r\ndefenseless ones whom our Government pledged its faith to protect, have\r\nbeen sadly despoiled and reduced to poverty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only expressed my opinion, gentlemen; I mean no slur upon yours.\r\nI hope you see now that I alone, _I am_ the one to blame for the\r\npurchase of the land which has given so much offence. Good night,\r\ngentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo profound was the silence following Mrs. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s exit, that a pin\r\ncould have been heard drop. Romeo Hancock was the first to find\r\nutterance to his amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut ain\xe2\x80\x99t she superb! I see now where Clarence\r\ngets his good sense and correct ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt any other time, Darrell would have been proud of this tribute paid to\r\nthe wife he adored, with passionate, secret, unrevealed tenderness, but\r\nnow he was too angry. He even felt angry at the longing to take to his\r\nheart that darling so resolute and yet so gentle. This longing, when his\r\npride clamored that she was wrong and should be reproved, was an\r\nadditional torture to him. He remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I suppose that\xe2\x80\x94in the language of the poets\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98this settles our\r\nhash,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang said, and laughed at his witticism, as it was his habit\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nHughes and Miller laughed with him, but no one else. All were deeply\r\nimpressed with Mrs. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish she had told me this before,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said, and resumed his\r\nrecumbent position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause women are bound to do mischief,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe stated her reasons very clearly,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were they?\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan your memory be failing you already, Mr. Mathews, that you forget\r\nwhat you just heard, or are you getting hard of hearing?\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nMathews snorted and turned his back on Romeo. Everett answered him,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy mother said that she wished the purchase to be kept quiet until the\r\nDon should have his title. Then the fact of the land being his, would\r\nprove the correctness of having paid for what we took, and thus all\r\ndiscussions would have been avoided. Unfortunately some busybody went to\r\nsee the entry, and came to herald his glorious discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did she know that the Don\xe2\x80\x99s title would not be rejected?\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer good sense told her,\xe2\x80\x9d Romeo answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mathews retorted, making all laugh\xe2\x80\x94and even\r\nDarrell smiled\xe2\x80\x94but he looked very pale, and Everett began to feel\r\nanxious, to see his pallor.\r\n\r\nThe conversation had now drifted to the subject of the coming survey of\r\nthe rancho.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard that the surveyor will be on the ground by the first of\r\nOctober,\xe2\x80\x9d Miller said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; that will give us plenty of time,\xe2\x80\x9d Gasbang observed.\r\n\r\nEverett said something to Romeo, who then went and whispered to his\r\nfather, whereupon Old Hancock nodded an assent and in a few moments\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friends, let us go home. For the present I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that\r\nanything can be done. Mr. Darrell looks fatigued, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at\r\nit, for we have bored him nearly to death. Let him go to bed and rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvidently Mathews, Gasbang and others had no idea of going home so\r\nearly, but as Darrell said nothing, they reluctantly arose and took\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\nIf Darrell had obeyed the impulse of his heart when he went up-stairs to\r\nhis bed-chamber, he would have taken his wife in his arms and, with a\r\nkiss, made his peace with her; for he knew her to be true, and always\r\nacting from the best motives. But there was that streak of perversity\r\nwithin, which impelled him to do or say the wrong thing, when at the\r\nsame time an inner voice was admonishing him to do the opposite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, William, that I kept that matter of the land purchase from\r\nyou. Believe me, my husband, I did so out of a desire to avoid\r\ndiscussions always painful to me. You seemed so happy here, that I hated\r\nto bring up for argument any disagreeable subject. It was a mistake; I\r\nregret it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, wise women generally put their foot in it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning his\r\nback on her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan you forgive me? I am very sorry. And now I want you to take a nice\r\nwarm bath; after so much excitement it will soothe you, and you will\r\nsleep sweetly. After all, it is better that you know the whole thing\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo thanks to you, though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, but you know my maxim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich one? Wise women have so many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo accept blessings thankfully, even when they come in disguise,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nreplied, taking no notice of his sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have yet to see the blessing in this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will to-morrow if you will only take care now of your physical\r\ncomfort\xe2\x80\x94your health. Come, take a bath; it will prevent your having a\r\nfever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want a bath; I feel badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why you should have it. I know your constitution well\xe2\x80\x94nothing\r\nwould be better for you than warm bathing. Be reasonable, please. I feel\r\ntired, too; I would like to go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I wanted first to see you resting for the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to bed. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep in this chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then, I shall go into Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s room and sleep there! It\r\nwould keep me awake to know that you were sitting up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo as you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible, William, that you refuse to go to bed because you\r\nare too angry with me to have me lie by your side?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, but looked very pale. She waited; he never said a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, William, I am dismissed I suppose. If you are sick or\r\nrequire anything, knock at Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s door. I shall be there. Good\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe went quietly into Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s room and lit a lamp. She went to a hall\r\ncloset and took a soft merino wrapper, came back, locked her door,\r\nundressed herself, put the wrapper on, and sat by the window to think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat fools men are? Such small vanity guides them. To think that\r\nWilliam should fling away happiness at the instigation of a reptile like\r\nGasbang! And you, my sweet boy, my darling Clarence, how will this\r\naffect your happiness?\xe2\x80\x9d This thought gave her the keenest pain.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Darrell was thus sadly meditating, her angry lord was nearly\r\nchoking with smothered rage\xe2\x80\x94intensified a hundred fold by his\r\ndisappointment at being left alone without his adored, worshipped Mary.\r\nMrs. Darrell knew that her husband loved her, but she had never guessed\r\nthat torrent of passion and devotion which rushed through that rugged\r\nnature like a river plunging from Yosemite hights into unknown abysmal\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nWhy would he not yield to her sweet entreaties to bathe and take his\r\ncomfort? Was it all perverse obstinacy? Partly, yes. He had refused a\r\nwarm bath and her sweet society, for the very reason that those two were\r\nthe things he most desired on earth\xe2\x80\x94he felt as if even his bones\r\nclamored for them. But there was yet another equally strong motive in\r\nthat very complex nature\xe2\x80\x94a motive stronger than obstinacy\xe2\x80\x94compelling him\r\nin spite of himself, and this was _his bashfulness_. He feared that his\r\nwife might see the bruises on his arms and the heavy welt that he knew\r\nthere must be around his body, made by the coil of the _reata_. He felt\r\nvery sore, and his bruises became more painful, but he would rather die\r\nthan let any one see his pitiful plight. And thus he sat up all night\r\nand would not undress, or go to bed, or be comforted.\r\n\r\nTowards morning he walked to the window and looked into the valley, then\r\nhis gaze wandered towards the Alamar house. All the windows had the\r\nshutters closed and no light was seen from them excepting one. He did\r\nnot know what room that was or who occupied it, but unconsciously he\r\nwatched it\xe2\x80\x94watched the light he could see through the lace curtains. The\r\nlight became intercepted at regular intervals; so he concluded that some\r\none must be going and coming before that light. He smiled, hoping that\r\nthe Don might be as miserable as he was\xe2\x80\x94unable to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut the Don was sleeping. She who was awake, walking in her solitary\r\nvigil, was Mercedes. Those beautiful blue eyes had never closed in sleep\r\nall night.\r\n\r\nShe had been embroidering a _mouchoir_ case for Clarence that\r\nunfortunate afternoon of Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s performance, when she heard loud\r\ntalking in the piazza. At first she paid no attention to it and went on\r\nwith her work, hoping that Clarence would return early, because her\r\ndream troubled her. The talking becoming louder, and more voices being\r\nheard, she felt alarmed, imagining that Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s horses had run away\r\nand he had been hurt. She went out to inquire.\r\n\r\nThe entire Alamar family, as well as Mrs. Mechlin, George and Lizzie,\r\nwere in the veranda. All had seen Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s attempt and subsequent\r\nsteeple-chase. Now Gabriel and Victoriano had returned and related what\r\nhad passed in the hollow. Victoriano was again overcome with laughter,\r\nwhich, being so hearty and uncontrollable, became contagious. Even\r\nGabriel and Mr. Mechlin, who were less disposed to indulge in hilarity,\r\nlaughed a little. Mercedes was the only one who not even smiled. She did\r\nnot understand a word of what was said. Gradually she began to\r\ncomprehend, and she stood motionless, listening, her pale lips firmly\r\ncompressed, her eyes only showing her agitation and how grieved she was;\r\ntheir dark-blue was almost black, and they glowed like stars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, little pussy. When Clarence comes he will undeceive the old\r\nman, and all will be right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, putting his arms around\r\nher yielding form and drawing her to his heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Palabra suelta, no tiene vuelta_,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said. \xe2\x80\x9cDarrell can\r\nnever recall his insulting words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he can apologize for them,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would that satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have to,\xe2\x80\x9d was the Don\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! papa!\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat then? Shall I go and shoot the old fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe he would enjoy that, he is so full of fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano\r\nsaid, recommencing his laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear his anger will not abate as long as the bruises of the _reata_\r\nremain painful,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you draw the _lazo_ very tight?\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot intentionally, but he himself did so by stooping forward as his\r\nhorse galloped. Every time he did so the noose became more closely drawn\r\nuntil he could scarcely breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a bad business, George,\xe2\x80\x9d the Don said to his son-in-law, who\r\nhad remained a silent listener to all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; but let us hope that between Clarence and Mrs. Darrell they\r\nwill pacify the old man. The thing now is to give him time to cool off\r\nhis anger,\xe2\x80\x9d George replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf those squatters could be kept away, Darrell would come to his senses\r\nmuch sooner,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel added; \xe2\x80\x9cthey make the mischief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why does he allow it?\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he loves the smell of gunpowder, and they are full of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Tano\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think Mrs. Darrell ought to prevent those horrible creatures from\r\ninvading her house,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey only go to the \xe2\x80\x98colony.\xe2\x80\x99 The old buster wants them there. He would\r\nsmash the furniture if his pets were not allowed to come to lick his\r\nboots,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano asserted, positively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t speak very respectfully of your future father-in-law,\xe2\x80\x9d George\r\nsaid to Victoriano, laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at present. Not when I have just seen him running away like a\r\nchicken thief, just caught with a turkey under each arm,\xe2\x80\x9d Tano replied,\r\nlapsing into another fit of laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Tano! if you care for Alice, how can you so ridicule her father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMercedes exclaimed, speaking for the first time. And without waiting for\r\na reply, she turned away and went to her room.\r\n\r\nThere she remained inconsolable, her lovely face often bathed in tears.\r\nShe did not go to bed; she hoped that Clarence might possibly have\r\nfinished his business in town and hurried back. She watched for the\r\nfaintest sound all night.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Madame Halier came to see her, and immediately went to\r\nreport to Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa the state of Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 eyes. Don Mariano came in\r\nat once and took his pet in his arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, you said you were going to-day. Please don\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d she begged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, my pet? I shall go only a little ways with those stupid\r\nIndians who keep letting the cattle turn back. I shall return before\r\ndark,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smoothing her golden hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, please don\xe2\x80\x99t go. I want you to be here when Clarence returns. Let\r\nthe cattle be. I want you here. You may never see Clarence again in this\r\nworld if you go.\xe2\x80\x9d And she put her pale cheek against her father\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nsobbed convulsively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat an idea! Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I see Clarence again if I ride one or two\r\nmiles? My baby darling, you are too nervous. You have cried all night,\r\nand now your mind is in a whirl of sad visions. Do not exaggerate the\r\nmischief that Darrell might do. He will probably say very insulting\r\nthings to Clarence, but Clarence is as true as steel, and has a very\r\nclear head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that. I am sure of him. He is so true. But, papa, can I marry\r\nhim after what his father said to you, and when he tried to strike you?\r\nCan I marry him after that, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, pray? What he said is an infamous lie, and because Darrell\r\nchooses to indulge in mean thoughts and atrocious language, is that a\r\nreason why you and Clarence should be made wretched for life? If Darrell\r\ndid not permit men like Gasbang, and others influenced by Peter Roper,\r\nto come near him, his ears would not hear such low, vulgar suggestions.\r\nAs long as we know that Clarence is a gentleman, and he behaves as such,\r\nI shall not permit that you two be separated by anything that Darrell\r\nmay do or say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, papa, you will keep out of Mr. Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, my poor little darling. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid; Darrell will not\r\nattack me again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Don talked in this consoling and reassuring way to his favorite\r\nchild until he saw that he had quieted her. She promised to eat\r\nbreakfast and then try to sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt won\xe2\x80\x99t do to look at Clarence through such swollen orbs. You had\r\nbetter let Tano give you one of his graphic accounts of the battle of\r\nAlamar, as he calls Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s performance, and make you laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t if I could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. To sleep is the best for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe kissed her and soon after he and Gabriel went on their way. They\r\nquickly overtook the herders, who were driving the lot of cattle which\r\nhad started at daylight. The Don was confident of returning at sundown,\r\nand glad to leave Mercedes more contented and hopeful, he rode away\r\ncheerfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\xe2\x80\x94_Darrell Astonishes Himself._\r\n\r\n\r\nMercedes felt so comforted by what her father had said, that in less\r\nthan ten minutes after he left she was sleeping like the good child that\r\nshe was. Madam Halier watched her slumbers, coming to the door every few\r\nminutes. And when she had slept and felt refreshed, she had a bath and a\r\nluncheon of tea, cold chicken, fresh peaches with cream, and fresh\r\ngrapes just cut from the vines; then she was ready to dress herself and\r\ntake up her embroidery. She was afraid her eyes would yet be too swollen\r\nfor her to go into the parlor or veranda, and perhaps meet George or Mr.\r\nMechlin. So she stayed in her room.\r\n\r\nBut she was missed, and George came to knock at her door, and being\r\nasked to come in, he did so, making a profound bow. Then counting on his\r\nfingers as he spoke, began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa, Do\xc3\xb1a Beatrice, Do\xc3\xb1a Carlota, Do\xc3\xb1a Rosario, Do\xc3\xb1a Elvira,\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Carolina, Do\xc3\xb1a Elizabeth, all request the pleasure of your company\r\nat a canning performance to take place this afternoon in the kitchen of\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Beatrice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes laughed, asking: \xe2\x80\x9cAre they really going to do the canning? Who\r\nknows about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey all know, theoretically, but as to practice, that \xe2\x80\x98_qui\xc3\xa9n sabe_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHowever, they are going to peal peaches by the bushel this evening, so\r\nthey will all dine there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t mamma expect papa to dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she, alarmed; \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and inquire,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, going; but she followed him,\r\ntrembling\xe2\x80\x94she did not know why. She took George\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and both went to\r\nthe piazza, where Carlota, Rosario and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa were waiting for\r\nGeorge to go with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, don\xe2\x80\x99t you expect papa to dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d asked she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he might be late; so we will dine at Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s, and he\r\nand Gabriel will take supper here on their return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will wait for them here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you not go to Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, please. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stay home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake my advice, and don\xe2\x80\x99t see Clarence yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, after what his father did and said, the least you have to do\r\nwith the Darrells the more it will be to your honor,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosario said,\r\nsententiously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must I give up Clarence because\xe2\x80\x94because his father gets mad,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd insults your father, and insults you,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that would be awful,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking at George, who full of\r\nsympathy for his favorite sister-in-law, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not worry about that now\xe2\x80\x94you have suffered enough. No doubt,\r\nClarence will make it all right, if we only give him time. All will be\r\nexplained.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt that,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mercedes knows all that Darrell said. I think Clarence\r\nhimself will see the impossibility of his marrying Mercedes as things\r\nare now,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes exclaimed, in low, tremulous tones, that\r\nrevealed all the desolation she felt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to be courageous, little sister,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat to do? Clarence himself ought to know\xe2\x80\x94to separate for the present.\r\nWill you marry the son of a man who said of you and your father such\r\nhorrible things?\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Clarence is innocent, and so am I,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mercedes, with white\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy daughter, do you not see that I _must_ withdraw my permission to\r\nyour marriage now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell that to Clarence?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mercedes, frightened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, as soon as I see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd break our engagement?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, with a voice scarcely audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. What else, my daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to go to my room,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, slowly turning to go back, walking\r\nas if in a dream.\r\n\r\nGeorge put his arm around her shoulder, and walked with her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be discouraged, my dear _humanita_. Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa is justly\r\nindignant now, but her anger will pass off, and she will see how absurd\r\nit will be to punish you and Clarence for the sins of his ill-tempered,\r\nfoolish father. The only thing now is to drop the matter. \xe2\x80\x98Least said,\r\nsooner mended,\xe2\x80\x99 applies to this case exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish papa were here. He don\xe2\x80\x99t think as mamma does. If mamma sees\r\nClarence first, she will send him away. Oh! that will be awful to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will keep your mamma at our house until Don Mariano returns. Tano\r\nwill see Clarence first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen George left, Mercedes hurried to her bedside to pray. In all the\r\nsad tribulations of her mind, her heart turned to her Redeemer and the\r\nBlessed Virgin Mary. To them she told all her grief, all her trials, and\r\nafter begging to be strengthened, she always arose from her bended knees\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, her convulsive sobs only became more uncontrollable,\r\nas she poured out her great sorrow and terrible fears before the pitying\r\nMother of suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nWhen her sobs were almost a paroxysm, Madame Halier, who had come to the\r\ndoor to listen, went, and much excited, told Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa that Mercita\r\nwould certainly be ill if some one didn\xe2\x80\x99t show a little humanity to her.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa hurried to Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 room, and found her still at her\r\nbedside sobbing and praying. Gently the mother lifted her child and\r\npressed her to her heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes, darling, have courage. Your father and Clarence will talk\r\nthis matter over, and determine what is best to do. Perhaps it might all\r\nbe arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not tell Clarence to\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x94to go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. But there must be some other arrangement about the\r\nwedding. It will be postponed, perhaps. Darrell could not be expected to\r\nbe present, or he might wish the engagement broken off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCarlota and Rosario came in to see how Mercedes felt, as Madam Halier\r\nseemed to be so anxious and indignant with everybody for their cruelty\r\nto Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf old Darrell wants the engagement broken off, then my dear sister you\r\nmust break it\xe2\x80\x94else he will have a good reason to say that papa wants to\r\nsell you, or to entrap Clarence, for his money, into marrying you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRosario said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid Mr. Darrell say that?\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes asked, blushing, so that her pale\r\nface became suffused to the roots of her hair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe said worse\xe2\x80\x94but you had better hear no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is awful!\xe2\x80\x9d the poor child exclaimed, clasping her hands in\r\neloquent protestation; then adding: \xe2\x80\x9cMamma, I will try to have courage.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I am to do. But if my father has been so grossly\r\ninsulted, I must feel for him. I must not be selfish. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d and the unhappy girl pressed her hands to her forehead, as if\r\nto keep together her distracted thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the best thing for you to do is to go to bed. To-morrow your\r\nfather will see Clarence. That is George\xe2\x80\x99s advice, and I think it is\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x9d said her mother, as she kissed and embraced her, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nsweet, blued-eyed baby is too young to get married, any way, and can\r\nwell wait four years, and then be only twenty-two years old.\xe2\x80\x9d But seeing\r\nthe blank despair in those expressive eyes, Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa hastened to add:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say that you will wait that long, but that you are young enough\r\nto do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Mercedes was again alone, she tried to think it was her duty to her\r\nfather to break her engagement. Her mind utterly refused to see the\r\nmatter in that light, but as her older sisters had said her engagement\r\nought to be broken off, and her mother spoke of the wedding being\r\npostponed, it was clear that she could not be married on the 16th. Would\r\nClarence be willing to wait? and these thoughts revolved around her mind\r\nin a circle of coils, worse than the one which so enraged and hurt\r\nDarrell.\r\n\r\nMadam Halier and Victoriano ate their dinner alone\xe2\x80\x94with Milord for sole\r\ncompany. Poor Tano, though he had laughed heartily at Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s plight,\r\nwas scarcely less distressed than Mercedes, and anxiously looked for\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s return.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime this young gentleman was traveling at the rate of twelve\r\nmiles per hour, and would have come faster had the road been better. He\r\nhad been obliged to delay, because Hubert had telegraphed that if he\r\nwaited two hours he would give him a definite answer about Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness. The answer came, and it was all that could be desired. Gabriel\r\ncould go at any time, or wait until the first of October to take his\r\nplace at the bank. Clarence was delighted to have this good news to\r\ncarry to Mercedes, with the addition that Fred said that the mines\r\ndeveloped richer ores every day. He had an offer of two million dollars\r\nfor his mines\xe2\x80\x94but both Hubert and Fred advised him not to sell.\r\n\r\nWith these cheerful thoughts, he was getting into his ph\xc3\xa6ton, when the\r\nnotary, who had made the entry of Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s conveyance, came close\r\nto him, and said in a low voice, and looking mysteriously around:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, it may be nothing, but those two fellows are so tricky and\r\nslippery that I always imagine they are up to something, and both have\r\nbeen twice to look in my books at the entry of the land conveyance which\r\nSe\xc3\xb1or Alamar made to you. They might mean mischief, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf whom are you speaking?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Roper and Gasbang. Why should they wish to know about that\r\nconveyance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but I am sure it is for no good. When did they look at\r\nthe entry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout two days ago, the last time. When they first looked at it I was\r\nnot at home. My wife was at my office when Roper came and asked\r\npermission to see the date of a conveyance which he himself had made.\r\nThis was only a ruse. Two days after he came and told me that one of his\r\nclients wanted to buy land from Darrell, and wished to see what sort of\r\na title he had. I, of course, let him see it. Gasbang came after, and\r\nthat made me suspicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence thanked the notary, and drove home as fast as the uneven road\r\npermitted. He felt that he must at last disclose to his father all about\r\nthat land transaction, and feared that he would be angry. His fears, he\r\nsaw, were only too well founded as soon as he arrived home.\r\n\r\nThe family were at supper when he drove up to the door. On hearing the\r\nsound of wheels, Everett left the table and hastened to meet him. All\r\nhis brothers and sisters would gladly have done the same, but a look\r\nfrom their mother kept them in their chairs.\r\n\r\nIn a few words Everett condensed the unfortunate occurrences of the\r\nprevious day and evening, ending his hurried statement by saying that\r\nthe entire family hoped that Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s influence might appease their\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s irritation when nothing else would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I am sure that if mother has failed, I shall have no effect at\r\nall,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut are you sure that there is nothing else to\r\nanger him? The fact alone of my having paid for the land, and at my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s request, would not so infuriate him while in his normal state\r\nof mind. There must be some _other_ irritating circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone that we know of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad he did not strike the Don.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I, though I have a big bump to testify that he struck _me_, and I\r\nsuppose Tano has another to speak for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence told the servant who came to take the horses to the stable to\r\nleave them where they were, only throwing a blanket on, as he had driven\r\nthem very fast. He and Everett then walked into the hall, carrying some\r\nsmall parcels which he (as usual) had brought home\xe2\x80\x94one of those parcels\r\nbeing a beautiful pipe, for which he had paid forty dollars, and a lot\r\nof fine tobacco, for his father.\r\n\r\nPlacing them on the hall table, he said to Everett: \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose father\r\nwould rather throw this tobacco into my eyes than put it in his pipe and\r\nsmoke it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverett laughed at this, thinking it rather a witticism under the\r\ncircumstances, and was still laughing when both went into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nClarence said good evening to all, kissing his mother as he took his\r\nseat beside her. Darrell never lifted his eyes, paying no attention to\r\nhis son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you laugh just now, Retty?\xe2\x80\x9d Willie asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that Clary said,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Everett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it anything funny?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been; but you needn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I want to hear it,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been about your father, he is the funny man now\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nlaughing stock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell to Willie; then to Clarence: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have had\r\ncircus performances. Your father distinguished himself by performing\r\n_in_ the tight rope, with Don Gabriel\xe2\x80\x94a very tight rope,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nmaking a semi-circular sign around his body with both hands, and nodding\r\nhis head at Clarence by way of emphasis, or as if he challenged him to\r\ncontradict his statement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father! I am very sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d was all that Clarence could answer.\r\n\r\nThe entire family were almost choking with suppressed laughter, but none\r\ndare give vent to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you laugh\xe2\x80\x94all of you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he, looking around fiercely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you frighten their laughter away,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell replied. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nfear to offend you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOffend me? _Me?_ And since when such consideration? Since when, I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince they were old enough to know you as their father,\xe2\x80\x9d calmly replied\r\nMrs. Darrell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am glad to hear it. Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, addressing Clarence\r\nagain, to the terror of all the family, \xe2\x80\x9cI have at last learned that you\r\nhave been making clandestine bargains with your future father-in-law,\r\nplacing me in a most ridiculous position, for which I don\xe2\x80\x99t thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, father. My intention was most kind,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence answered,\r\nrespectfully, but very calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou only thought that as I was a fool, you would be my sense-bearer,\r\nand act for me\xe2\x80\x94you, the man of brains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir. All I thought was, that as you seem to love my mother, you\r\nwould prefer to give her the kind of home that she desires. I thought\r\nthat when you came to know all, you would approve of my having obeyed my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were so sure of my approval, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me the whole\r\nthing before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I was pledged to my mother not to do so. I was bound to be\r\nsilent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George!\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, striking the table with his fist, making all\r\nthe glasses and cups dance; \xe2\x80\x9cand for all that nonsense I have been made\r\na laughing stock, a ridiculous, trusting fool\xe2\x80\x94an ass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will think that but yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell said; \xe2\x80\x9cand you will\r\nchange your mind, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how do you know that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was supposing that people reason in the way that in all my life I\r\nhave believed to be correct.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, what _you_ believe to be correct no one else has any right to\r\nthink differently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether they have or not, I shall not interfere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you only wanted to interfere with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. As my life is united to yours, I am obliged to try and\r\nprevent such of your actions as will make me unhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent doctrine for wives\xe2\x80\x94for mothers to teach their children\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwe see the result now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrell was pleased that his attacks seemed directed to herself\r\ninstead of Clarence, but she felt prematurely relieved, for now he came\r\ndown upon Clarence. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, since yourself and your mother have bought this land, and\r\nsince I am an unreclaimed _squatter_, I suppose I had better leave this\r\nplace, and go back to Alameda again. I suppose I can have that place\r\nagain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not have to lease it, father; you can have it rent free, as\r\nlong as you live, if you prefer to reside there,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI bought the place, and if you wish you can live in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou? _You_ bought the place! Then, by George! _you_ have managed to\r\ncoop me up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Darrell, drawing down the corners of his mouth and\r\nelevating his shoulders deprecatingly, as if he thought Clarence was a\r\nvoracious land-grabber, who wanted to appropriate to himself all the\r\nvacant land in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, please. The place was for sale, Hubert telegraphed me,\r\nand I telegraphed back to buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were so rich,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, sneeringly.\r\n\r\nClarence made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must admit you have cornered me completely; but as I don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nto live on the bounty of my rich son, I must get out of this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can refund me the price of one hundred and sixty acres, father, if\r\nyou are too proud to accept that from me, which is little enough,\r\nconsidering your generosity to me all my life. The other two claims, you\r\nknow, you said would be one for Retty and the other for myself. This\r\nhouse and the orchards are all on your claim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have taken a dislike to the whole thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, waiving his hand,\r\nas if to shift the position of the land in question. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can have it\r\nall, together with the Alameda farm. There are other lands in\r\nCalifornia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrell and Clarence looked at each other. The case seemed\r\nhopeless. All were silent.\r\n\r\nMr. Darrell continued: \xe2\x80\x9cAll I want before I leave here is to give your\r\ngreaser father-in-law a sound thrashing and another to that puppy,\r\nGabriel, who is so airy and proud, and such an exquisite, that it will\r\nbe delightful to spoil his beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you wish to do that? What has Don Mariano done to you?\r\nand if Don Gabriel threw his _lazo_ on you, it was to protect his\r\nfather.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has the old greaser done? He inveigled you into that land\r\nbusiness, and you together have made me ridiculous. That is what the\r\nmatter is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe me?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Darrell said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you take so much credit to yourself, and throw yourself into the\r\nbreach like a heroine. If the Don hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had that pretty daughter,\r\nClarence would not have been so obedient to his mother, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence rose to his feet, very pale, but he sat down again, and\r\ncontrolling himself, said as calmly as possible:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had never seen one, not one of Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s daughters when I went to\r\noffer to pay for this land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done so if your mother hadn\xe2\x80\x99t wished\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sir, not that. I think I would, for I felt great sympathy with the\r\nDon for the contemptible manner in which the squatters received the\r\npropositions he made them. I was convinced then that the land belonged\r\nto him, and nobody had a right to take it without paying for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha! I knew we would come to that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, sternly, glaring at\r\nhis son. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a thieving squatter, of course, and that is what you\r\nsaid to your greaser father-in-law, who to reward your high sense of\r\nhonor, took you to the bosom of his family. The cowardly dog, who will\r\ntake insults and not resent them, but has puppies at his heels to throw\r\n_lasooing_ at people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw! I never thought you capable of\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what? Insulting those greasers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are gentlemen, no matter how much you may wish to besmear them\r\nwith low epithets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen that won\xe2\x80\x99t fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey told you they would fight _like gentlemen_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did, father. I heard Don Mariano and Don Gabriel both tell you that,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEverett said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they are so ready to fight, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they do it when I told the\r\nold dog that the bait to catch you was his daughter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! Did you say that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Clarence, reddening to the roots of his\r\nhair, his face quickly blanching again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did\xe2\x80\x94in clear language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn dirty, low, nasty language, and it is you who are the coward, to\r\ninsult _me_ under the shelter of your paternal privileges,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClarence, rising. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been taunting me until I can bear it no\r\nlonger. I suppose you wish to drive me from your house. Be it so. I\r\nleave now\xe2\x80\x94never to enter it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat suits me. You are too _greasy_ for both of us to live under the\r\nsame roof,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, contemptuously, with a gesture of disgust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-by, mother; good-by, my sisters; good-by, boys\xe2\x80\x94take care of mother\r\nand the girls. God bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a piercing cry, that rang through the house, Alice ran to Clarence,\r\nand throwing her arms around his neck, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss me, my darling, for if you leave us I shall be wretched until you\r\nreturn. Oh! I can\xe2\x80\x99t let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTenderly Clarence pressed his sister to his heart. He felt her arms\r\nrelaxing, her head fell back, and she closed her eyes. Lovingly he then\r\nlifted her, and placing her upon a lounge, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlice has fainted, mother. My sweet sister, how dearly I love her, God\r\nonly knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe covered her face with kisses, while his own was bathed in tears.\r\nWithout lifting his eyes or saying another word, he walked out into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe delicious, fragrant air, loaded with the perfume of roses and\r\nhoneysuckle and heliotrope, seemed to breathe a farewell caress over his\r\nheated brow, and the recollection of the loving care he had bestowed\r\nupon these flowers when he planted them to welcome his mother, flashed\r\nthrough his memory with a pang. He sighed and passed into the gloom,\r\noverpowered with a dread that made him feel chilled to the heart. It\r\nseemed to him as if an unseen voice was warning him of a dire misfortune\r\nhe could not perceive nor avert. What could it be? Was Mercedes to be\r\ntaken from him? Would her family object to him on account of his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s ruffianly behavior? Could he claim to be a gentleman, being the\r\nson of that rough? These thoughts flashed through his mind, filling him\r\nwith sickening dismay and inexpressible disgust. Would he dare stand in\r\nthe presence of Mercedes now? Or, would he return to town at this late\r\nhour? Where could he go for a shelter that night?\r\n\r\nMechanically he walked to the ph\xc3\xa6ton, got into it and took the reins to\r\ndrive off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\xe2\x80\x94_Shall it be Forever?_\r\n\r\n\r\nEverett followed Clarence and got into the ph\xc3\xa6ton with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear brother,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, in a hoarse voice that sounded\r\nunnatural, as if coming from a great depth, \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to have your\r\ncompany, but as I am not coming back, I can\xe2\x80\x99t take you with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo matter; drive off. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with you a little ways, and will walk\r\nback,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everett. Clarence turned his horses and drove away through\r\nthe middle drive in the front lawn, and was out of the gate before he\r\nfully realized that he himself was driven away from the paternal roof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRetty, you did not tell me that my father had insulted my darling so\r\ngrossly. I wish you had, for I would not have gone inside the house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nClarence said, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so horrible, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Forgive me, dear Clary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; I can\xe2\x80\x99t blame you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you going to Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I will ask Tano to give me a place to sleep; that is, if Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa is not too disgusted to tolerate a Darrell under her roof.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure they feel nothing but kindness for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so; but should she wish to break the engagement, I will not\r\nstay. I\xe2\x80\x99ll drive to town to-night and take the boat for San Francisco,\r\nwhich is not to leave until to-morrow at daylight. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have time, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do that. Wait for the Don, if he is not in now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI may, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I dread to see Mercedes. I feel so humiliated,\r\nso ashamed. What can I say to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the hill Clarence stopped his horses to send to his\r\nmother and sisters\xe2\x80\x94especially to Alice\xe2\x80\x94loving messages. He also said if\r\nhe should miss seeing Don Mariano, Everett would say that he would write\r\nfrom San Francisco, and would return at any moment, if Mercedes called\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you will see her yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the disheartened Clarence, driving up toward the house\r\nin which he felt his fate would be decided. Victoriano had heard the\r\nph\xc3\xa6ton\xe2\x80\x99s wheels and came out to meet it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad to see you, old fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Clarence; \xe2\x80\x9cit seems an\r\nage since sundown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was detained in town about that business of Don Gabriel, but it is\r\nall arranged. He can take his place at the bank now, whenever he wishes,\r\nor wait until the 1st of October; it will be kept for him. Then I had my\r\nown business about the mine. That is all right, too. I only wish that\r\nthings had gone on as well at home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo do I, but it has been awful. Retty told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know it all now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately I did not tell him father\xe2\x80\x99s insulting remarks about Miss\r\nMercedes,\xe2\x80\x9d sadly observed Everett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, had I known that, I would not have gone into the house. But I\r\nwent, and father had the satisfaction of saying it to me himself; and on\r\nmy telling him what I thought about it, he expressed himself willing\r\nthat I should take myself off. So here I am, driven from home, and I\r\ncame to ask you for a bed to-night, as I am very tired.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hungry, too. Father spoiled his supper with his courteous remarks,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Everett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my dear boy; no one is more welcome to this whole house,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nVictoriano said, with true Spanish hospitality, much intensified by\r\npresent circumstances. \xe2\x80\x9cCome; father will soon be here. At present,\r\nMercedes, Madame Halier Milord and myself only are at home. Mother and\r\nthe rest are at the Mechlins. Come in; come, Retty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say good-by to Clary now and walk home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is awful,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano said, as if beginning to realize the\r\nsituation. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, where are you going? And why must you\r\ngo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not if Mercedes does not send me away. If she does, I shall go\r\nfirst to San Francisco, and thence God only knows where,\xe2\x80\x9d was Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe won\xe2\x80\x99t send you away; she shan\xe2\x80\x99t. If you only knew how the poor\r\nlittle thing cried, so that this morning literally she could not see out\r\nof her eyes, you would then know how she feels. She told me that if she\r\nlost all hope of being your wife she would lie down and die. She felt\r\nbetter this morning when father left, as he told her he would arrange\r\neverything with you so that the wedding should not be postponed. Then\r\nshe was comforted and went to sleep. But\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d And Victoriano stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what? Better tell me all, dear Tano,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I was going to say that she is again unhappy because Lotte and\r\nRosy told her what your father said. She had not heard that part of the\r\ntrouble before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence stood silent with one foot upon the first step. He was\r\ncalculating the chances against him. He turned to Victoriano, and, with\r\na sickly smile that was truly painful to see, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy heart misgives me, dear Tano; I cannot blame her if she considers my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s words unpardonable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they were not _your_ words,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett interposed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to\r\nblame if your father forgets _himself_ and makes a brute of _himself_. I\r\nalmost hate him. Courage, dear Clary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, remember, \xe2\x80\x98Faint heart never won fair lady,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano added,\r\nand the quotation brought such sweet recollections to poor Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntroubled mind, that he staggered as he went up the steps. But, with a\r\nrenewed effort over himself, he managed to stand firmly, and to say to\r\nEverett:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose we must part now, dear brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverett threw his arms around him, and for a few moments both brothers\r\nheld each other in close, silent embrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheer up, boys. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think you are to part,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, with\r\nassumed cheerfulness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must come to breakfast with us to-morrow\r\nRetty. When father comes he and Clary will concoct some plan so as not\r\nto postpone the wedding. Come, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you home. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Mercedes\r\nknow first that Clarence is here.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying he walked into the house.\r\nReturning in a few moments, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalk in, Clary. Mercedes will be in the parlor in a minute. Now, Retty,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile both drove to the Darrells, Clarence went in the parlor to wait\r\nwith beating heart Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 coming. He walked about the room looking at\r\nevery object in it without seeing anything. When he heard the rustle of\r\nher dress, he stood by the piano with his arms crossed over his breast\r\nas if trying to compress the wild throbbing of his heart. He was pale to\r\nthe lips and his eyes had an expression of longing, of beseeching\r\ntenderness, that was far more sad and eloquent than tears would have\r\nbeen. Mercedes came in, followed by her faithful Milord, who, seeing\r\nthat Clarence paid no attention to him, turned up his nose in mild\r\nresentment and went to lie down upon the rug in front of the fire-place.\r\nShe offered to Clarence her hand in silence. In silence he took it,\r\nkissed it and led her to a sofa, sitting down by her side. She was the\r\nfirst to speak. Looking into his eyes, she said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence, must we part? I have such, faith in your truth that I believe\r\nyou will candidly tell me your opinion, even if it kills both of us. Am\r\nI right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy darling, what is it? Do not put me to a test that may be too hard,\r\nfor I tell you frankly I can give up my life, but not my love. Not you!\r\nmy own! Oh, no; anything but that. Not that.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, he took both\r\nher hands\xe2\x80\x94the beauty of which he so loved\xe2\x80\x94and kissed them warmly, all\r\nthe time fearing that if she said to him that she must break off their\r\nengagement, he must submit, as he could not blame her if she considered\r\nhim beneath her love. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you wish to ask me? Oh, my angel! be\r\nmerciful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to ask you what must I do when your father has said such\r\nfrightful things to my papa? Am I obliged and in duty bound to decline a\r\ntie which will create any relationship with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence was silent, still holding the dear little hands. His face\r\nflushed with shame, but became pale again as he replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been more difficult to solve that problem if my father\r\nhimself had not done so by driving me off. I am exiled now\xe2\x80\x94driven away\r\nfrom home. I doubt whether he would consider you related to him by being\r\nmy wife now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, quickly, but then checking herself, and a\r\nlittle abashed by what she thought the hasty expression of a selfish\r\nfeeling, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cForgive me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean I am glad he should drive\r\nyou away, but that since he has cut you off\xe2\x80\x94and yet\xe2\x80\x94he cannot do that.\r\nHow can he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has done so. That proves he can, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Clarence. No matter what he does he is still your father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence leaned his head back on the sofa and looked at the chandelier\r\nin silence for some moments, then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is my father, but not the father he used to be. There are\r\ndifferent kinds of fathers. Some are kind and good, others are most\r\nunnatural and cruel. Are they entitled to the same love and respect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut was he ever cruel to you before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever. He has been always most kind and indulgent to all his children,\r\nbut especially so to Alice and myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Clarence, for this one fault, all his life of kindness and\r\ndevotion must not be forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling! are you going to plead for him and forget my misery? My\r\nheart is bleeding yet with the pain of leaving home, and if your\r\nindulgence to him means that I must bear the burden of his fault, _I\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94I must suffer alone_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not wish you to suffer at all. If there is to be any suffering, I\r\nshall share it with you. No. All I say is that if Mr. Darrell is so\r\nangry at my papa and myself, we had better postpone our wedding until\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence sprang to his feet, and with hands pressed to his forehead,\r\nbegan pacing the room, greatly agitated, but without speaking a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence, hear me. It will only be for a little while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, and continued his walk\xe2\x80\x94his mind a prey to the wildest\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it not be very unbecoming for us to marry now, and your family\r\nnot be present at the wedding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be present? All would be but father, and in the\r\nfurious state of his feelings he had better be away\xe2\x80\x94a great deal\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x94far, far away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince he is so furious, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would like his wife and\r\nchildren to be at our wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes, tell me frankly,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, resuming his place at her side:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctell me, has my father\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous conduct made me lose caste in your\r\nestimation? If so, I shall not blame you, because when a man acts so\r\nungentlemanly, so ruffianly, it is fair to suppose that his sons might\r\ndo the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever! Such an idea never entered my mind. How could it?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nMercedes, with great earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it did not, it is because you are good and generous. Still, perhaps,\r\nit is selfish in me to keep you to your engagement with the son of such\r\na rough. I release you, Mercedes. You are free,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and he closed\r\nhis eyes and leaned his head again on the back of the sofa. A sensation\r\nof icy coldness came over him, and he thought that death must come like\r\nthat. But for all that mental agony, he still thought Mercedes would be\r\nright in rejecting him.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene as described to him by Everett, when his father was\r\nuttering those low insults to Don Mariano, came vividly before him, and\r\nhe thought it would be impossible for Mercedes not to feel a sense of\r\nhumiliation in uniting herself to him\xe2\x80\x94he, the son of that brutish\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x94that rough. He arose, and his pallor was so great that Mercedes\r\nthought he must be ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes, we part now. Heaven bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence, you are ill. What do you mean? Will you not wait for papa?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I had better go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou misunderstood me, I think, else how could you think of going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not say that our wedding had better be postponed? And does that\r\nnot mean that it may never, _never_ be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should it mean that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, how can we measure the duration of an anger so senseless? It\r\nmight last years. No, Mercedes, I feel that you have the right to reject\r\nme. I shall be so very wretched without you, that I would beg and\r\nentreat, but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence, I do not reject you, and I have no right, no wish, to do so.\r\nPlease do not say that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you be mine\xe2\x80\x94my wife\xe2\x80\x94after all the ruffianly words my father has\r\nsaid?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Why should I blame you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own, my sweet wife. Oh! how dearly I love you! The strength of my\r\nlove makes my heart ache. Will you call me when you think you can\r\nconsent to our wedding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by asking if I will _call_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that if our marriage is to be postponed, I shall leave you, but\r\nshall be ready to obey your call, and I pray I may not wait for it a\r\nlong time. And I say this, also, that if upon reflection you decide to\r\ncast me off, I shall not complain, because\xe2\x80\x94because my father has lowered\r\nme. I am not the same Clarence I was two days ago. You cannot feel proud\r\nof me now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do. Please do not say those dreadful things. Why should you go\r\naway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is best, as long as our marriage is to be postponed. My\r\npresence here will be a cause of irritation to my father, and goodness\r\nknows what he might not do in his angry mood. If you would not feel\r\nhumiliated by marrying me, the best thing would be to have a quiet\r\nwedding immediately, with only the members of your family present, and\r\nnot invite guests at all, and then we would take the steamer to San\r\nFrancisco, and go to our home there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think mamma would consent to that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my darling, I must leave you now. I will return to town, and take\r\nthe steamer which leaves at daylight, I shall abide implicitly by what\r\nyou decide. Make known your wishes, and I shall obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are offended, Clarence, and I do not know how I have incurred your\r\ndispleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in those tones of her voice which were the most\r\nthrilling to him\xe2\x80\x94most sure of going straight to his heart.\r\n\r\nSilently he approached her, and kneeling at her feet, he put his arms\r\naround the slender and graceful form he idolized so fervently. He rested\r\nhis head on her shoulder for a few moments, then with a sigh, that\r\nseemed to come from his very soul, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not offended, my sweet rosebud, but I am very miserable. Pity me.\r\nYou see, on my knees I beg you to marry me now\xe2\x80\x94immediately\xe2\x80\x94in two days.\r\nIf not, I must go now\xe2\x80\x94to-night. Say, will you marry me, as I _beg_ of\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clarence, why do you ask me? How can I tell? You will have to ask\r\npapa and mamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill they consent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, perhaps; but I fear mamma will not approve of such a hasty\r\nmarriage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so. Perhaps I am unreasonable. Good-by, my beloved. Will you\r\ncall me back soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence, you are not going? How can you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must. Do not ask me to remain, under the circumstances, unless it is\r\nto make you my wife. I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe pressed her to his heart in a long, tender embrace. He arose, and\r\ngazed at her sweet face so sadly, that she felt a pang of keen distress\r\nand apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClarence, do not look at me so sadly. Please remain until papa comes.\r\nDo not go. You might never see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must, or I will lose the steamer. Farewell, my own sweet love.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe clasped her to his heart, and wildly covered her face with kisses.\r\nThen, without daring to look back, hurried out of the room into the\r\nhall, across the piazza and down the garden-path to the gate, where his\r\nph\xc3\xa6ton had been left by Victoriano, after having taken Everett home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must naturally hesitate to marry the son of a man who can act and\r\nhas acted as my father did. I cannot blame her. I ought to respect her\r\nfor it. Oh, pitying God! how wretched I am! Farewell, happiness for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuttering this short soliloquy, Clarence drove quickly down the incline\r\nleading to the main road.\r\n\r\nWhen the last sound of his footsteps died away, a feeling of utter\r\ndesolation rushed upon Mercedes. The silence of the house was appalling.\r\nIn that silence it seemed to her as if a life of lonely misery was\r\nsuddenly revealed. To lose Clarence, was to lose happiness forevermore.\r\nShocked and terrified at her loneliness, with no hope of seeing him\r\nagain, she rushed out and ran to the gate, calling him. She saw that he\r\nwas driving fast, and would soon be crossing the dry bed of the brook to\r\ntake the main road. Once there he would be too far to hear her voice.\r\nShe ran out of the gate and turned to the right into a narrow path that\r\nalso led to the main road, going across the hill through the low bushes\r\nand a few elder trees near the house, thus cutting off more than half\r\nthe distance. Loudly she called his name, again and again, running in\r\nthe narrow path as fast as her strength allowed. She heard the sound of\r\nthe ph\xc3\xa6ton\xe2\x80\x99s wheels as they grated harshly on the pebbles of the brook,\r\nand then all was silent again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my darling is gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, and the ground swelled and moved\r\nunder her feet, and the trees went round in mad circles, and she knew no\r\nmore. She had fallen down fainting, with no one near her but her\r\nfaithful Milord, who had followed her, and now nestled by her side.\r\n\r\nClarence had heard her voice call to him, and tried to turn his horses\r\nimmediately, but they were going down the hill too fast to turn without\r\ndanger of upsetting; he saw he must first get to the foot of the hill,\r\nand turn when he reached the brook. He did so, and with heart-throbs of\r\nrenewed hope, he re-ascended the hill and hurried to the house. At the\r\ndoor he met Madam Halier, who was blinking at the hall lamp as if just\r\nawakened from a sound sleep. Clarence asked for Miss Mercedes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think madamoiselle has just gone down to Madame Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s. I heard\r\nher calling Tano, and that woke me up. I had just dropped off into a\r\nshort nap of five minutes\xe2\x80\x94_just_ five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I heard her voice in this direction,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, pointing\r\nto the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no. I think she was afraid to go to Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s alone, and she\r\ncalled her brother. But she has been anxious to see you all day. I will\r\nsend a servant to say you have come. Walk in. Had you a pleasant drive\r\nfrom town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadam, I have seen Miss Mercedes since my return from town. I had said\r\nfarewell, and was driving away, when I thought I heard her voice calling\r\nme. Perhaps I was mistaken, but I think not. Where has she gone, I\r\nwonder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Madam Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s, monsieur.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so. Good-by, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, extending his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will you not wait for madamoiselle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam; if she did not call me, I need not wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time Clarence drove slowly down the hill, looking at both sides of\r\nthe road, peering under the trees and bushes, still impressed with the\r\nidea that he might see her form or hear her voice. The moon was just\r\nrising, casting long shadows as it arose, but the shadow of that\r\nbeloved, graceful form was nowhere to be seen. This added disappointment\r\nwas added bitterness to his cup of misery, and he began to feel sick in\r\nbody and mind, and he saw in himself a most wretched outcast.\r\n\r\nTano and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa now came and saw the ph\xc3\xa6ton ascending the hill on\r\nthe other side of the brook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\xe2\x80\x94_Hasty Decisions Repented Leisurely._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Victoriano had left Everett at his front door, exacting the promise\r\nthat he would come to breakfast with Clarence next morning, he merely\r\ndelayed long enough to learn that Alice was quiet, and Mrs. Darrell\r\nthought that with a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest she would be well next day. He then\r\ndrove back home, and thinking that Clarence was going to stay, left the\r\nph\xc3\xa6ton at the front gate to run down through the side gate to Mrs.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s, to call his mother and say to her that Clarence had been sent\r\noff by his father, and had come to their house to pass the night. But as\r\nhe hurried through the front garden, Victoriano remembered that the\r\nhorses had to be put in the stable and taken care of, so he went in the\r\nkitchen to tell a servant he must attend to the horses immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, _patroncito_, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it right away,\xe2\x80\x9d said the lazy Indian, who\r\nfirst had to stretch himself and yawn several times, then hunt up\r\ntobacco and cigarette paper, and smoke his cigarette. This done, he,\r\nhaving had a heavy supper, shuffled lazily to the front of the house, as\r\nClarence was driving down the hill for the second time, and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa\r\nand Victoriano returning from Mrs. Mechlin, came in through the garden\r\nside gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is going in that carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d was the first question put by\r\nVictoriano to Madame Halier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Monsieur Clarence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where is Mercedes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe called you to go to Madame Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo such thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, going to look in the parlor; returning\r\nimmediately to renew his questions.\r\n\r\nBut the madame could do no more than repeat all she knew, which was\r\nlittle enough, and that little thoroughly mixed in her mind.\r\n\r\nAll that Victoriano and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa could ascertain, with some\r\nclearness, was that Clarence was going, and had come back, thinking that\r\nMercedes had called him, but that on being told that Mercedes had called\r\nTano to accompany her to Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s, he had gone away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must overtake Clarence. There is some misunderstanding here, that is\r\nplain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, going to the back piazza to call a servant.\r\n\r\nThis time Chapo came a little quicker, not knowing whether he would be\r\nto blame, because the _Americano_ went off with his horses before he had\r\ntime to put them in the stable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBring me my bay horse, saddled, in two minutes, do you hear? Two\r\nminutes\xe2\x80\x94not two hours\xe2\x80\x94go quick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot find Mercita. She is not in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa to\r\nher son, much alarmed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be, mother. Call the other girls. Look again for her. I must\r\nrun after Clarence, and learn why he is going, instead of passing the\r\nnight here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes after Clarence had left, Victoriano was galloping behind\r\nhim, wondering why he could not see him anywhere on the road.\r\n\r\nMadame Halier and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa continued looking for Mercedes most\r\nanxiously, but in vain. George now came up, and joined in the search for\r\nthe missing girl.\r\n\r\nAs Victoriano crossed the brook and ascended the hill beyond it, Don\r\nMariano and Gabriel came up into the court-yard. They immediately\r\nhurried into the house, Don Mariano knowing that Mercedes would be\r\nanxious for him to talk with Clarence.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa and the madame met them at the door, and related as well as\r\nthey knew all that had occurred. They all agreed that the matter had\r\nbetter be kept from the servants, if possible, and they all went out by\r\nthe front gate again, since it was useless to search in the direction of\r\nMrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s house. Don Mariano and Gabriel saw George follow the path\r\nto the right and disappear. They followed him. George had heard the\r\nbarking of a dog in the distance, and at first paid no attention to it,\r\nbut when the barking would be followed by most piteous howls, he\r\nlistened, and thought he recognized the plaintive whining of Milord. He\r\nfollowed the path, and as he did so, came nearer to the barking, and\r\nsoon after Milord himself met him, with demonstrations of great\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nGeorge had no doubt now of finding Mercedes. He let Milord be the guide,\r\nand run ahead, he following. In a few minutes he saw something white on\r\nthe ground, and immediately after recognized Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 form lying\r\nmotionless across the path, as she had fallen. In a moment George had\r\nlifted her insensible form in his arms, calling out he had found her.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano ran to him, but Gabriel, being more active, passed him, and\r\nwas quickly at George\xe2\x80\x99s side, gazing anxiously at his sister\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive her to me, George,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, in a hoarse whisper, for he\r\nwas so agitated he could scarcely speak. \xe2\x80\x9cGive my baby to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a little while. I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry her a little longer,\xe2\x80\x9d said George,\r\nholding the unconscious girl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather is too agitated to be steady enough just now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gabriel.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll carry her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see her face, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Has she no life?\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes. She has fainted only. We will soon restore her to\r\nconsciousness. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed. I think the parting with Clarence has\r\nnearly killed her\xe2\x80\x94but she is alive,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why did they part? Why did he go?\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is as much a mystery to me as to you,\xe2\x80\x9d George replied.\r\n\r\nThe fainting girl was tenderly placed in her bed, and all the care that\r\nloving hearts could bestow was lavished on her. But nearly two hours\r\nelapsed before she returned to consciousness. Then, after looking\r\nvaguely about the room for some minutes, an expression of pain came over\r\nher face, and looking at her father, she asked for Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVictoriano has gone to call him,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano replied, hoping that this\r\nlittle fiction would come true, and believing it would if Victoriano\r\ncould overtake the fugitive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am so glad,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and with a sigh closed her eyes, lying so\r\ncalmly that it was difficult to see whether she had relapsed into a\r\nswoon, or lay so quiet from sheer exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, he for whose love all this misery was suffered\xe2\x80\x94and who\r\nshared it fully\xe2\x80\x94was flying onward as rapidly as a couple of fast\r\nthoroughbreds could take him. Victoriano followed at full gallop,\r\nconfident of overtaking him, or if not, of being in town before the\r\nsteamer left. But the fates decided it should not be as the heart of the\r\nanxious rider wished, and when he rode up to the wharf the steamer was\r\nleaving it. He could see its lights moving swiftly away, and hear the\r\nshaking and revolving of the wheels on the smooth bay, as the black,\r\nfloating mass glided off, like a cruel monster swimming away with the\r\nhappiness of so many loving hearts.\r\n\r\nVictoriano stood looking at the steamer with a disappointment so keen\r\nthat it seemed unbearable. He could have rebelled against any power.\r\nThen a sense of realization of the inevitable came like a revelation to\r\nhim, and he felt overpowered, surrounded by dangers that he might not\r\navoid, because they would come upon him unawares.\r\n\r\nIn this perturbed state of mind he was still looking at the steamer\r\npassing over the moonlit bay, when the freight agent for the steamer\r\ncame to say that Mr. Darrell had left a note for him, and he would bring\r\nit if he waited. Victoriano not only would wait, but followed to the\r\ndoor of the freight office.\r\n\r\nThe agent said, as he handed the note, that Mr. Darrell had left orders\r\nat the stable to keep the two horses and ph\xc3\xa6ton until Don Victoriano\r\nsent for them. Eagerly Victoriano read the note. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n    _Dear Tano_:\r\n\r\n    Forgive me for not waiting to bid you good-by. I feared to miss\r\n    the boat; and since Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa desired to postpone the wedding,\r\n    I thought it was best for me to be away, under present\r\n    circumstances. It would be too unendurable in my painful\r\n    humiliation to be constantly dreading some other unexpected\r\n    outbreak from my father. My presence would be a source of\r\n    irritation to him, which might lead to worse results.\r\n\r\n    Say to Don Mariano and Don Gabriel I will write to them as soon\r\n    as I reach San Francisco, perhaps before. My love to all of you,\r\n    my good and beloved friends. Heaven bless you all.\r\n\r\n    I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to think kindly of me, for I know you will. I\r\n    feel sick in mind and body; and how I wish I could have slept\r\n    under your hospitable roof.\r\n\r\n    Tell Retty to write or telegraph how Alice is. I was so\r\n    disappointed not to find Miss Mercedes when I drove back. I had\r\n    felt so sure I heard her voice calling me, that I was faint with\r\n    disappointment and thoroughly heartsick.\r\n\r\n    Good-by, dear Tano, again. God bless you all.\r\n\r\n        Ever your true friend,\r\n          Clarence.\r\n\r\n    P. S.\xe2\x80\x94I leave you my horses and ph\xc3\xa6ton\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for Victoriano to do now but return home. He went to\r\nthe stable, ordered fresh horses put to the ph\xc3\xa6ton, and leaving his own\r\nhorse with the other two, said he would send for them when they were\r\nthoroughly rested. He went to see Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s horses himself to be sure\r\nthat they were well groomed. Two men were rubbing them down, and he saw\r\nthat neither of the two fine animals had been hurt by their furious\r\ndrive. He patted them, and they turned their pretty heads and\r\nintelligent eyes, expanding their nostrils as they recognized him.\r\n\r\nVictoriano was so depressed that he felt a presentiment of never more\r\nseeing Clarence. He looked at the two horses as if they were a last\r\ntoken of his friendship, and he hurried out of the stable and out of\r\ntown quickly, to be alone with the silent moon and his own thoughts; his\r\nthoughts of Alice, of Clarence and Mercedes going with him, as he drove\r\nhome. But Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts of those three interesting persons were\r\nshared by many others.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa sat by Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 bedside. Her heavy slumber\r\nbegan to alarm them. She lay motionless, with closed eyelids, but she\r\nwas not sleeping, for she would open her eyes when they spoke to her.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa asked her if she had been sleeping. She shook\r\nher head and whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting for Clarence. He is coming, sitting on a water lily. I see\r\nhim. I am waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe look of dismay that Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa exchanged with her husband, revealed\r\nto each other their terrible anxiety and dread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must wait for Victoriano, and if Clarence does not come, then we\r\nmust send for a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano whispered.\r\n\r\nBut Mercedes heard him, and said, scarcely audibly: \xe2\x80\x9cHe will come. I am\r\nwaiting. He loves me. He don\xe2\x80\x99t want to kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Victoriano arrived it was near daylight, but Don Mariano was up and\r\ncame out to meet him. Seeing the ph\xc3\xa6ton with only one occupant, he knew\r\nthe sad truth. Victoriano gave him Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s letter, which he read with\r\nthe keenest regret, feeling that if he had stayed at home, as Mercedes\r\nhad begged, Clarence would not have felt compelled to go, but would have\r\nbeen made happy under that roof, as he deserved to be. Vain regrets now.\r\nHe was gone, and there was nothing to be done but wait until he arrived\r\nat San Francisco. It would only be a matter of three days, Don Mariano\r\ntried to argue to himself, but the experiences of the last two days had\r\ntaught him how much mischief might be effected in a very short space of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 room he found that she was sleeping, but\r\nher sleep was restless, and now a high fever had set in. Her cheeks were\r\nlike red roses, and her pulse beat with telegraphic velocity. She moaned\r\nand moved her head, as if it pained her, but did not awake. It was\r\nevident that a doctor must be sent for immediately.\r\n\r\nVictoriano never drove or rode past Darrell\xe2\x80\x99s house without looking at a\r\ncertain window next to that of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s room. As he came from town\r\nnow, before driving into the court of his own house, he looked towards\r\nthe well-known window. His heart beat with alarm, seeing a light through\r\nthe shutters. Alice must be ill, he thought, and that light has been\r\nburning all night. The lover\xe2\x80\x99s heart had guessed the truth. Alice was\r\nill with a raging fever, and when daylight came, instead of the fever\r\npassing off, as Mrs. Darrell had hoped, she became delirious.\r\n\r\nVictoriano did not go to bed. He preferred to walk out to the front\r\npiazza and have another look at that window of Alice\xe2\x80\x99s room. Yes the\r\nlight was still burning. He felt sure that she was ill. Was she to be\r\nsick, and he not able to see her? or inquire for her? How angry he felt\r\nat old Darrell. Poor Tano, he was a prey to contending emotions. He now\r\nwished to see Mercedes, and had told his father that he would lie in one\r\nof the hammocks in the veranda, instead of going to bed, so that he\r\nwould be called to Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 room as soon as she awoke.\r\n\r\nPresently Don Mariano came and said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cVictoriano, Mercedes is\r\nawake, but so entirely out of her head that she does not know any one of\r\nus. We must send for a physician.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go at once,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano said, jumping to his feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you have been up all night. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want too many sick to take\r\ncare of. Gabriel will go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVictoriano looked towards the fascinating window, and hesitating a\r\nlittle, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid Alice is sick too. Evidently a light has been burning in\r\nher room all night. She fainted when Clarence was leaving them, and for\r\nthe last two days she has been so nervous, Everett says, that she was\r\nalmost in convulsions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some one going out in Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s buggy. Perhaps they are\r\nsending for a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano said, watching the buggy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Everett.\r\nAlice is ill, I am sure. Retty is coming this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverett was driving fast, and in a very few minutes was at the gate, and\r\ncoming to the piazza.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ventured to come up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I saw you here. It is a most\r\nunchristian hour to go into a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Alice sick, Retty?\xe2\x80\x9d Victoriano asked, without heeding Everett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napology for coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she has a high fever, and is very delirious. I am going for a\r\ndoctor, but as she has been calling for Clarence most piteously, mother\r\nthought he would come to see her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano and Victoriano turned several shades paler than they were\r\nbefore, but they related to Everett what had happened, as far as they\r\nknew. Still the reason _why_ Clarence left must yet remain a mystery to\r\nthem until Mercedes could explain it.\r\n\r\nEverett was greatly disconcerted and pained. He had hoped to find\r\nClarence, and as his father seemed moved and grieved at Alice\xe2\x80\x99s illness,\r\nall the family inferred that he would be only too glad to see Clarence\r\nrestored to them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hurry for a doctor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Everett, with trembling lips, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nwhen Clarence arrives in San Francisco he will find a telegram awaiting\r\nhim there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will find two,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can never stay away if he knows that Miss Mercedes and Alice are\r\nsick\xe2\x80\x94sick with grief at his going from us,\xe2\x80\x9d Everett said; adding: \xe2\x80\x9care\r\nyou not going to send for a physician for Miss Mercedes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Gabriel will go very soon,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is your doctor? Can\xe2\x80\x99t I call him for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn being told the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s name, Everett said that he was the one he\r\nproposed to bring for Alice. Don Mariano then wrote a line asking the\r\ndoctor to come, and Everett hurried off on his sad errand.\r\n\r\nClarence had passed the night on deck, walking about in the moonlight,\r\nor sitting down to muse by the hour, with no one near\xe2\x80\x94no company but his\r\nthoughts. He felt ill and weary, but wakeful, and could not bear to lie\r\ndown to rest. He must be moving about and thinking. He felt convinced\r\nthat his father had some _other_ cause of irritation than the mere fact\r\nof the land having been paid for, but what that cause could be he had\r\nnot the remotest idea. Then his thoughts would go back to their center\r\nof attraction, and pass in review, over and over again, the last scene\r\nat the Alamar house, and every word that Mercedes had said. The more he\r\nreflected upon them, the clearer it seemed to him that Mercedes could\r\nnot help thinking it would be humiliating to marry him, for how could a\r\nlady marry the son of a man who used such low language? And if she did,\r\nout of the purest devotion and tenderest love, could she avoid a feeling\r\nof loathing for such a man? Certainly not; and such a man was his\r\nfather; and Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts traveled around this painful circle all\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Wilmington, he heard the puffing of the little tug boat,\r\ncoming to ferry the passengers to Los Angeles. He had nothing to do at\r\nLos Angeles, but he would go with the passengers, rather than wait all\r\nday in the steamer at anchor, rolling like a little canoe, and whose\r\nfate was too much like his own\xe2\x80\x94as he, too, was tossing over a broad\r\nexpanse, a boundless ocean, like a block of wood, helpless, compelled to\r\nobey, as though he was an infant. He took a cup of coffee, and joined\r\nthe passengers on the little tug boat, which was soon meandering over\r\nthe shallow, muddy creek, or rather swamp, with its little crooked\r\nchannels, which is to be made into an harbor, with time, patience and\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nAt Los Angeles a surprise awaited Clarence, an incident which, coming\r\nafter those of the previous night, was delightful, indeed. He was\r\nsauntering past a hotel, when he heard the well known voice of Fred\r\nHaverly, calling him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the very man I came to see. I am now expecting at any moment, a\r\ndispatch from Hubert in answer to my inquiry for your whereabouts,\xe2\x80\x9d Fred\r\nsaid, conducting Clarence to his room, where they could talk business\r\nwithout being interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe business which brought Fred up from the mines was soon explained,\r\nand in conclusion Fred said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could go with me, see the ores yourself, and talk with the\r\nmen who wish to buy the mines. But the weather is frightfully hot, and\r\nyou are not looking well. What is the matter? May I inquire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence soon told Fred all that had happened at home, and how he was\r\nexiled, and did not care where he went. Fred was truly distressed, for\r\nhe had never seen Clarence take anything so much to heart and be so cast\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what we had better do to-day. Let us take a carriage, and\r\ngo for a drive among the orange groves. Then we will come back to\r\ndinner. After dinner we will kill time somehow for a couple of hours,\r\nthen you go to bed. To-morrow you will decide what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to-morrow there will be no steamer to take me to San Francisco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen wait for the next. The matters you have under consideration are\r\ntoo important to decide hastily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true. I wish some one had reminded me of that fact last\r\nevening. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the steamer go, and if I do not decide to go with you,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take the next boat. But now, as to our drive, I think I would\r\nrather have it after I had some breakfast, because I begin to feel\r\nfaint, having eaten nothing for twenty-four hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence sat down to a very nice breakfast, but did not succeed in\r\neating it. He had no appetite. All food was distasteful to him. They had\r\ntheir drive and dinner, and he managed to get some sleep. This, however,\r\ndid not refresh him, and he felt no better. Still, he decided to go to\r\nsee his \xe2\x80\x9c_bonanza_,\xe2\x80\x9d and talk with the men who wished to buy the mines.\r\nIf he did not sell them, Fred thought stamp mills ought to be put up, as\r\nthe ore heaps were getting to be too high and too numerous and very\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nClarence devoted that day to writing letters. He wrote to his mother,\r\nAlice and Everett, to George, Gabriel and Victoriano; but his longest\r\nletters were to Mercedes and Don Mariano.\r\n\r\nOn the following day he and Fred took the stage for Yuma. When they\r\nreached that point, the river boat was about to start, thus Clarence and\r\nFred lost no time in going up the river to their mines. But as the\r\nnavigation up the Colorado River, above Fort Yuma, was rather slow,\r\nhaving to steam against the current following the tortuous channel of\r\nthat crooked, narrow stream, and the mines were more than three hundred\r\nmiles from Yuma (about thirty from Fort Mojave), they did not arrive as\r\nsoon as they would have wished, and Clarence had been stricken down with\r\ntyphoid fever before they reached their camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\xe2\x80\x94_Effect of Bad Precept and Worse Example._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whir of threshing machines was heard in the valleys of the Alamar\r\nrancho, and wagons loaded with baled hay went from the fields like\r\nmoving hills. The season had been good, and the settlers, forgetting\r\ntheir past conduct, were beginning to calculate on the well-known good\r\nnature and kind heart of the Don, to get their lands by purchasing them\r\nfrom him at a low price and easy terms when he got his patent.\r\n\r\nGasbang and Mathews were the only ones who still slandered the entire\r\nAlamar family, in the vilest language, having for their instigator and\r\nlegal adviser the little lawyer, Peter Roper, _proteg\xc3\xa9_ of Judge Lawlack\r\nand partner of Colonel Hornblower.\r\n\r\nEverybody in San Diego knew that Roper had made for himself a most\r\ndiscreditable record, unblushingly vaunting of his degradation, but\r\nbecause he managed first to become a partner to the pompous Colonel\r\nHornblower, and then\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfor some secret service unexpressed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to be a\r\nspecial favorite of Judge Gryllus Lawlack, Roper was not only tolerated\r\nbut well treated. Even among the respectable people of San Diego Roper\r\nhad clients who, when he was intoxicated, or when he was obliged to keep\r\nhis bed because, as it often happened, he had been too severely whipped\r\nin some drunken brawl, would patiently wait for him to get sober and on\r\nhis feet again. Why did those respectable people employ such a low,\r\ndisreputable character? strangers in town asked. The answer was:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Because Roper says he has so much influence with the Judge_?\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nverily Roper, intoxicated or sober, won his cases, for when in ignorance\r\nof the law, he made any mistakes, which he generally did, being only an\r\namateur lawyer, the Judge, with his rulings, would remedy the harm done,\r\nthus unwittingly, or not, assisting Roper, giving him a seemingly good\r\ncause to boast that he had _retained the Judge_, and by so boasting get\r\nclients. Of course, many of Judge Lawlack\xe2\x80\x99s decisions were constantly\r\nreversed, but the serene majesty of the law in his Honor\xe2\x80\x99s breast was\r\nnot in the least disturbed by this; on the contrary, he spoke jestingly\r\nabout being constantly reversed, and said jokingly to lawyers that if\r\nthey desired to win their suits they should not wish him to decide in\r\ntheir favor, as the Supreme Court was sure to reverse him.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the strength of his vaunted influence with the Judge,\r\nRoper had gone to the Alamar rancho to solicit the patronage of the\r\nsettlers. He was willing to take contingent fees, he said, as he was\r\nsure to win.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what if your friend, the Judge, is reversed, as he always is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRoper would be asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then we will make a motion for a new trial, or we will call the\r\nsame suit by some other name, and file a new complaint, or do something\r\nelse, so as to keep in possession of the property. Possession, as long\r\nas it lasts, is ownership.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in the end you don\xe2\x80\x99t win?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho says we don\xe2\x80\x99t? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it to win if you keep in possession as long as\r\nyou live? Or, any way, as long as _my Judge_ is in office? And in office\r\nhe shall be, for I shall keep him there, if I have to swill whisky by\r\nthe barrel in election times, see if I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with this low bragging and bar-room swagger Roper managed to impose\r\nupon people, saying that his influence kept the Judge in office, because\r\nhe had advocated his cause and worked to have him elected. So, with his\r\ndelusive sophistry, Peter got clients among the Alamar settlers. While\r\nmaking inquiries about the Alamar lands he came across the entry made by\r\nDon Mariano of the land sold to Clarence. This discovery he communicated\r\nto Gasbang, and we have seen what resulted.\r\n\r\nNow these two worthies were rejoicing at the effect they had caused, and\r\nwould have been happier had they known the full extent of the misery\r\nthey had inflicted. They guessed enough, however, to furnish them with\r\nmatter for their coarse jests, and Roper got intoxicated to celebrate\r\nhis triumph. He, of course, came out of the tavern with a black eye, but\r\nbeing the chosen friend and political _factotum_ of the Judge, this\r\npublic degradation was kindly condoned, and San Diego threw its cloak\r\nover the prostrate Roper, as usual, when overcome by whisky.\r\n\r\nIt would have seemed unbearable to Darrell if he had known how amused\r\nand pleased Roper and Gasbang were to know that they had brought trouble\r\nto the Alamares, and made him ridiculous. This additional misery,\r\nhowever, was fortunately spared to the already much-afflicted, proud\r\nspirit. But, indeed, he suffered enough to have satisfied the most\r\nrelentless _Nemesis_. No one guessed the extent of his misery. In fact,\r\nClarence was the only one who suspected the existence of some secret\r\nsource of irritation goading him, and had that kind son been permitted\r\nto remain at home, he would have coaxed and persuaded his father to say\r\nwhat was torturing him. For torture it was\xe2\x80\x94mental and physical. A band\r\nof purple and black encircled his body, and his arms were of that same\r\nhue from the elbow to the shoulder. The bruises made by the tight coil\r\nof the _reata_ had left a narrow ring, which became blacker as it grew\r\ndaily wider and wider. He had done nothing to relieve the soreness, and\r\nhe went about aching so much that he could scarcely walk, and with a\r\nfever to intensify his pains, he was indeed a wretched man. But all this\r\nphysical suffering was nothing compared to the mental distress of being\r\nbereft of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s cherished society. He knew that Mrs. Darrell was\r\ngrieved to think that he was the cause of all the unhappiness brought\r\nupon two innocent families, and this thought almost made him crazy.\r\n\r\nHe was willing to accept his bodily aches as a retributive penance for\r\nhis cruelty to Clarence, but to endure the loneliness of his room when\r\nhis infirm body could hardly bear the weight of his bitter remorse, that\r\nindeed seemed beyond human strength. He would go to his solitary\r\nbedroom, close the door, and extend his aching, bruised arms in silent\r\nappeal, in mute supplication to the adored wife who was now in another\r\nroom, at the bedside of Alice, forgetful of the entire world except the\r\nsuffering child before her, and the exiled one, for the sight of whom\r\nher heart yearned with aching pulsations.\r\n\r\nAnd where was he, the best beloved, now? He lay on a sick bed,\r\ndelirious, with a raging fever that seemed to be drying the very\r\nfountain of his young life. They had not made a very quick trip to Yuma,\r\nfor the hot sands of the desert seemed to burn through the very hoofs of\r\nthe horses, and they were obliged to stop at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock A.M., and not\r\nresume their journey until past three in the afternoon. The exposure to\r\nthis excessive heat was more than Clarence had strength to endure, for\r\nhe was already ill when he arrived at Los Angeles. He was only partially\r\nconscious when they arrived at the mine, and Fred now gave all his time\r\nand attention to the care of his friend. By a great effort of his mind,\r\nClarence had succeeded in impressing upon Fred that he was, on no\r\nconsideration whatever, to tell to his family or write to anybody in San\r\nDiego that he was ill. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must not be made anxious,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I get well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them myself; if I die, they\xe2\x80\x99ll know it soon\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x9d He closed his eyes, and in a short time delirium had come to\r\nmake him forget how miserable he was.\r\n\r\nImmediately Fred telegraphed to Hubert to send the best physician he\r\ncould induce to come to that terribly hot climate. No money or trouble\r\nwas spared, for the two brothers valued Clarence too highly to neglect\r\nanything that might be for his benefit. The doctor went at once. The sum\r\nof five thousand dollars was paid down to him, and five thousand more he\r\nwould get on his return after leaving Clarence out of danger, if he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, his letters, sent from Los Angeles, had arrived at\r\nAlamar, and were answered immediately. In his letters to Gabriel and\r\nGeorge, Clarence had explained that his absence must not make any\r\ndifference in the business arrangement they had made, and the projected\r\nbank would be established by George whenever he thought fit to do\r\nso\xe2\x80\x94whenever the prospect of the Texas Pacific Railroad justified it. For\r\nthis purpose, and to pay for the cattle sent to the mines, he had\r\ninstructed his banker to pay to Don Mariano three hundred thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nGabriel replied, thanking him, and saying that he would adhere to the\r\noriginal plan of going to San Francisco by the first of October, when he\r\nhoped Mercita would be out of danger. If Clarence could only have read\r\nthese letters!\r\n\r\nGeorge answered him that he did not intend returning to New York until\r\nMercita got better (Elvira not wishing to leave home while her sister\r\nwas yet in danger), but that he would be ready to return to California\r\nand establish their projected bank at any time that the business outlook\r\njustified it; that the chances seemed much in favor of the Texas\r\nPacific, and all were hopeful. If Clarence could only have read this!\r\n\r\nDon Mariano wrote a cheerful letter, telling him to return at once. The\r\nfact of the matter was that he confidently expected to see Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbright face very soon; to see those eyes of his, with their brilliant\r\nglow of kindness, emanating from a generous, manly heart. How could it\r\nbe otherwise when all that was necessary would be to recall him, and\r\nrecalled he had been?\r\n\r\nBut days and days passed, and Clarence did not come, nor any letters\r\nfrom him either, and the month of September, which was to have brought\r\nso much happiness, had been passed in sadness, and was now ending in\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nMercedes and Alice were no longer delirious, but their condition was\r\nstill precarious, and the anxious parents could not lay aside their\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nThus the month of October passed, and November came, bringing the United\r\nStates Surveyors to measure the Alamar rancho in accordance with the\r\ndecree of the United States District Court. This advent, though fully\r\nexpected, did not fail to agitate the settlers of Alamar. It brought\r\nbefore their minds the fact that the law, though much disregarded and\r\nsadly dilatory, did sometimes, as if unawares, uphold the right.\r\n\r\nGasbang and Mathews, inspired by Roper, were very active in trying to\r\nurge the settlers to some open demonstration. Roper wanted lawsuits, and\r\nhe saw a chance now to originate several; but the settlers were rather\r\ndisposed to be quiet, and disposed to wait until the survey was finished\r\nand approved, for, after all, what had they to do? The Don took no steps\r\nto eject them. What pretext had they to complain?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI expect we will have to kick _him_ out of his own house,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter\r\nRoper, and laughed, thinking it would be such a good joke to do that;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand by \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94, if you only show me the ghost of a chance, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you the Don\xe2\x80\x99s enemy, Roper? Did he ever do you any injury?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nRomeo asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my! No; why should he? I am nobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemy; but if I can make any\r\nmoney by kicking him out of his house, don\xe2\x80\x99t you suppose I\xe2\x80\x99d do it? You\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know me if you think I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d was Roper\xe2\x80\x99s characteristic\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nBut his sharp yellow eyes clearly saw that Gasbang and Mathews were the\r\nonly ones really anxious to be aggressive, yet aggressive only according\r\nto the natural bent of their dispositions. Mathews was unscrupulous,\r\nvicious and murderous; Gasbang, unscrupulous, vicious and cowardly\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nwould use no weapons but the legal trickery of Roper, aided by the\r\nindulgence of Judge Lawlack\xe2\x80\x99s friendship. In fact, Judge Lawlack was a\r\nhost in himself, and when that host was led on to battle by the\r\nloquacious Roper against clients who had only justice and equity on\r\ntheir side, everybody knew that Roper\xe2\x80\x99s brow would be crowned with\r\nhonorable laurels of fraud and falsehood and robbery, while innocent\r\npeople were cruelly despoiled and left homeless. This, however, was\r\n(according to Roper) the _secret bargain_ between Judge Gryllus Lawlack\r\nand his favorite. This shameful debauchery of judicial power was the\r\nwages of the _political factotum_; and Roper unblushingly acknowledged\r\nit, and _boasted_ of it\xe2\x80\x94boasted openly, in his moments of exultation,\r\nwhen he had imbibed more whisky than was consistent with discretion;\r\nwhen he would become loquacious, and following the law of his being,\r\nwhich impelled him to swagger and vaunting, he longed to make known to\r\npeople his \xe2\x80\x9c_influence with the Court_.\xe2\x80\x9d Wishing at the same time that\r\nhe was facetious, to be considered a wit, he would relate several\r\nstories illustrative of _his power over the Judge_. One of these stories\r\nwas that of two litigants, who had had a lawsuit for a long time; at\r\nlast, one litigant came to the other and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here; you had better compromise this suit. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, on my\r\nside I have the law, the equity, the money and the talent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery true,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the other. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have the law, the equity, the\r\nmoney and the talent, but _I have the Judge_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Roper would laugh, thinking himself very funny, and with a wink\r\nwould say: \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you I run this whole town? Of course I do,\r\nbecause _I have the Court in my pocket_. Give us another drink.\xe2\x80\x9d And he\r\nstaggered for more whisky.\r\n\r\nCould the Judge ignore that his name and office were thus publicly\r\ndragged in the mire? Certainly not, but he would merely remark that \xe2\x80\x9cMr.\r\nRoper was joking,\xe2\x80\x9d seeing no disgraceful reflection upon himself.\r\n\r\nIn the full reliance of secured power, Gasbang and Roper decided that\r\nthey would do nothing while the survey of the rancho was going on, but\r\nwould watch and wait for developments, and then, relying upon the\r\nJudge\xe2\x80\x99s friendship to serve their purpose, start some plot to rob the\r\nAlamares or the Mechlins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we will watch and pray, brother John,\xe2\x80\x9d Roper said, with a nasal\r\ntwang. Gasbang was a church deacon.\r\n\r\nBut Mathews had no Judge Lawlack to bedraggle justice for his sake. So\r\nwhile Gasbang and Roper were jubilant, he became gloomy and morose. He\r\ncould not give vent to his ill humor by shooting stray cattle now; not\r\nthat he liked Clarence any better than he liked the Don, but he had\r\npromised Darrell not to shoot his son\xe2\x80\x99s cattle, and he could not afford\r\nto break his promise and make an enemy of so useful a man as Darrell. So\r\nMathews went back to his old love of whisky, and as his whisky was of\r\nthe cheapest, burning poison circulated in his veins. Miss Mathews, his\r\nmaiden sister, was seriously alarmed, observing her brother\xe2\x80\x99s ways of\r\nlate, and would kindly remonstrate against his drinking such poor\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor you see, William, all liquor is bad, but bad liquor is worse,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\npoor old maid would say, in unconscious aphorism, pleading with her\r\nhardened brother to the best of her ability.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when Mathews had been on a debauch of several days\xe2\x80\x99\r\nduration, Miss Mathews walked over to Mrs. Darrell, and apologizing for\r\nnot having been to see Alice, because she had had so much trouble at\r\nhome, said she wished to speak to Mr. Darrell. On being told by Jane\xe2\x80\x94who\r\nreceived her\xe2\x80\x94that her father had gone to the fields where grain was\r\nbeing threshed, she left word that she would thank Mr. Darrell to call\r\non her that evening. Agreeable to this request, Mr. Darrell started for\r\nMathews\xe2\x80\x99 house after supper.\r\n\r\nSlowly Darrell went over the field and across the little hollow where\r\nGabriel had taken him off his horse. Then he followed the path he had\r\ngalloped with the _reata_ around his body, and came to the road where he\r\nhad met the Don and tried to strike him. This was the first time Darrell\r\nhad been over this ground since that memorable day which was now\r\nrecalled to his mind so painfully. He wondered how he could have been so\r\nblind, such a fool, not to take the right view of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\r\nAh! and where was Clarence now, that beloved first-born boy, of whom he\r\nwas so proud? In this sad meditation, with head bowed down most\r\ndejectedly, Darrell followed the path until he came to a fence. He\r\nlooked up and saw this was the south side of Mr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s garden. He\r\nturned around the southeast corner and followed along the fence,\r\nremembering that going by that path he would shorten the distance to\r\nMathews\xe2\x80\x99 house. For a few rods Darrell walked in the path, but not\r\nwishing to be seen by the Mechlins, he left the path and walked close to\r\nthe fence, hidden by a row of olive trees. Presently he heard a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice, talking and walking up and down the piazza. On the next turn he\r\nsaw it was George Mechlin carrying his baby boy in his arms, kissing him\r\nat every few words.\r\n\r\nDarrell was pleased to see the young man kissing his child so lovingly.\r\nIt reminded him of his young days when he held his own first boy like\r\nthat. Then he felt a pang shoot through his heart as he thought that if\r\nit had not been for his wicked folly, Clarence in another year might\r\nhave held his own child, too, in his arms, as George was now holding\r\nhis, and that baby would have been his own grandchild! Darrell trembled\r\nwith the strength of his keen remorse\xe2\x80\x94a remorse which now constantly\r\nvisited him, invading his spirit with relentless fury, like a pitiless\r\nfoe that gave no quarter. He leaned against the fence for support and\r\nstood still, wishing to watch George caressing his baby. Meantime,\r\nGeorge continued his walking, his talking and caressing, which Darrell\r\ncould hear was occasionally reciprocated by a sweet little cooing from\r\nthe baby. Elvira came out on the piazza now, and he heard her say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, George, that baby ought to be in bed now. See, it is after\r\nseven, and he is still awake. You keep him awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin also came out and took the baby, saying he, too, must have a\r\nkiss. Then Mrs. Mechlin followed, and Caroline, and all caressed the\r\nbaby, showing how dearly they loved the little thing, who took all the\r\npetting in good part, perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\nAt last Elvira carried him off to bed, and Darrell saw George and Mr.\r\nMechlin go into the library and sit by the center-table to read. He\r\nthen, with down-cast eyes, continued his walk towards Mathews\xe2\x80\x99 house.\r\n\r\nHe found Miss Mathews alone, with eyes that plainly showed sad traces of\r\ntears, she was sitting by the lamp darning her brother\xe2\x80\x99s stockings,\r\nwhich, like those of Darrell himself, had always holes at the heels, for\r\nthe tread of both was alike, of that positive character which revealed\r\nan indomitable spirit, and it soon wore out the heels of their socks.\r\n\r\nAfter the customary inquiries for the health of the family, and the\r\nusual remarks about the crops being good, Miss Mathews went on to say\r\nthat she could no longer bear the state of her mind, and thought it was\r\nher duty to tell Mr. Darrell her fears, and prevent mischief that might\r\noccur, if her brother was not spoken to by somebody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat mischief do you fear?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see\xe2\x80\x94I can scarcely explain\xe2\x80\x94for, after all, it might be all\r\ntalk of William, when he has drank that horrible whisky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, he is awful sore about the appeal being dismissed, and\r\nhe blames it all on Mr. George Mechlin, and says he ought to be _shot\r\ndead_, and all other horrible talk. And now, since the surveyors came,\r\nhe is worse, saying that the Don will drive us off as soon as the survey\r\nis finished!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will do nothing of the sort. He is too kind-hearted,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said,\r\nand he felt the hot blush come to his face\xe2\x80\x94the blush of remorseful\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I think, but William don\xe2\x80\x99t, and I wish you would talk\r\nencouragingly to him, for he is desperate, and blames Congress for\r\nfooling settlers. He says Congress ought to be killed for fooling poor\r\npeople into taking lands that they can\xe2\x80\x99t keep, and Mr. Darrell I hope\r\nyou will talk to him. What is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe started to her feet, and so did Darrell, for the report of a rifle\r\nrang loud and distinct in the evening air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is William\xe2\x80\x99s rifle. I hope he did not fire it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\r\n\r\nDarrell went to the door to listen for another shot, but none was heard,\r\nso he came back and resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree times I have taken that very rifle from William. He was going to\r\nshoot cattle, he said, and I had to remind him that the cattle now\r\nbelong to your son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSteps were heard now, and Mathew\xe2\x80\x99s face peered through the window. Miss\r\nMathews gave a half-suppressed shriek, and dropped her sewing. Her\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s face looked so ghastly pale that it frightened her. He pushed\r\nthe door and came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes the old maid shriek like a fool?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour death-like face,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, going to a side-table to pour out whisky from a\r\ndemijohn he took from under it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, William! for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake! don\xe2\x80\x99t drink more,\xe2\x80\x9d she begged. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will\r\nmake you crazy, I am sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnybody might suppose I have drank a river, to hear the old hag talk\r\nlike that,\xe2\x80\x9d he snarled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not said good evening to Mr. Darrell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t give me a chance, with your infernal chatter. Mr. Darrell\r\nknows he is welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without looking at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is your rifle, William?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\nWith an oath he turned and glared at her, with distorted features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is none of your business where it is. Have I to give you an account\r\nof everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might have loaned it to somebody, for we heard it fired a\r\nlittle while ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no rifle but mine in this valley?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to say there are plenty, but I know the report of yours. I\r\nnever mistake it for any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMathews became so enraged, hearing this, and so violent and abusive in\r\nhis language, that Darrell had to interfere to silence him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you talk like that to your sister, I would advise her not to stay\r\nalone in this house with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said; \xe2\x80\x9cher life might be in\r\ndanger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish the devil would take the old hag,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe torments my\r\nlife. I hate her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with you, Billy?\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you so\r\nexcited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me mad to hear her nonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a calmer voice, but\r\nstill much agitated, and he again went to pour himself another drink.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathews whispered hurriedly to Darrell: \xe2\x80\x9cTake away his rifle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeighbor Mathews,\xe2\x80\x9d said Darrell, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to send my rifle to have it\r\nfixed, will you lend me yours for a few days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he gruffly, then folding his arms on the table and\r\nleaning his head upon them, immediately sunk into a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake the rifle with you now, Mr. Darrell, he might change his mind when\r\nhe awakes. I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Mathews, hurrying out of\r\nthe room. Presently she returned, and in her dejected countenance keen\r\ndisappointment was depicted. Dropping into her seat she whispered: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nrifle is not in the house. Somebody has taken it and fired it. I am sure\r\nthat was the shot we heard. I know the ring of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see. Perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99ll find out who fired it,\xe2\x80\x9d Darrell said,\r\nwalking towards the front door, followed by Miss Mathews, who preferred\r\nto make a few parting suggestions outside, not sure of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s soundness\r\nof sleep.\r\n\r\nAs both stepped outside the first object that met their eyes was Billy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrifle, peacefully reclining against the window.\r\n\r\nDarrell took it up and looked at Miss Mathews perplexed. She was looking\r\nat him aghast.\r\n\r\nThe undefined fears that neither one expressed were only too well\r\nfounded. The rifle had been fired, and fired by Mathews with murderous\r\nintent. For several weeks, instigated by Roper and bad whisky, Mathews\r\nhad been watching an opportunity to shoot George, because he had the\r\nappeal dismissed. This evening he at last saw his chance when George was\r\nwalking the porch caressing his baby. He could not take good aim while\r\nhe was walking, but when Elvira at last took the baby away and George\r\nwalked into the library, then, as he went to put the window down,\r\nMathews aimed at his heart and fired. Fortunately the ball struck the\r\nwindow sash, deflected and glanced down, striking the hip-bone instead\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\nDarrell and Miss Mathews were still looking at the rifle, as if\r\nexpecting that by a close examination they might guess who fired it,\r\nwhen they were startled by Mathews uttering frightful curses and\r\nsmashing the furniture. The noise brought two hired men, who were\r\nsmoking their pipes by the kitchen fire, and they helped Darrell to\r\ngrapple with the maniac and pinion his arms, tying him to a chair.\r\n\r\nMiss Mathews was greatly shocked to see her brother crazy, but she had\r\nbeen expecting it. She quietly consented to have him taken to an insane\r\nasylum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\xe2\x80\x94_A Snow Storm._\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s wound was not mortal, but it made it necessary to\r\nconvey him to town to have medical attendance near at hand, and no doubt\r\nit would be of a long and painful convalescence, with the danger, almost\r\na certainty, of leaving him lame for life. This danger was to him far\r\nmore terrible than death, but he concealed in the deepest recesses of\r\nhis heart the horror he felt at being a cripple, for he knew the keen\r\nanguish that Elvira suffered at the thought of such a probability. Her\r\nlovely black eyes would fill with tears, and her lips would tremble and\r\nturn white, when he or any one else spoke of the possibility of his\r\nbeing lame. So he had to be consoler, and soothe her grief, and be the\r\none to speak of hope and courage.\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of his being able to return to his duties at\r\ntheir bank in New York at present, and he, to cheer Elvira\xe2\x80\x99s desponding\r\nheart, would say that he could attend to a bank in San Diego.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be despondent, my pet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said one day, when she looked very\r\nsad; \xe2\x80\x9cthings will not be so bad, after all, for in the spring I will be\r\nwell enough to attend to bank business here, even if I cannot stand the\r\ntrip to New York. With the money that Clarence sent, and with what I\r\nwill put in myself, we can start quite a solid bank. Gabriel will have\r\nlearned a good deal by that time, and though I will not walk much, I can\r\nbe a very majestic President, and give my directions from my arm-chair.\r\nAll we want is the success of the Texas Pacific\xe2\x80\x94and my uncle writes that\r\nTom Scott is very confident, and working hard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will he succeed?\xe2\x80\x9d Elvira asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has powerful enemies, but his cause is good. The construction of the\r\nTexas Pacific ought to be advocated by every honest man in the United\r\nStates, for it is the thing that will help the exhausted South to get\r\nback its strength and vitality.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill it really help the South so much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t we see here in our little town of San Diego how\r\neverything is depending on the success of this road? Look at all the\r\nbusiness of the town, all the farming of this county, all the industries\r\nof Southern California\xe2\x80\x94everything is at a stand-still, waiting for\r\nCongress to aid the Texas Pacific. Well, the poor South is in pretty\r\nmuch the same fix that we are. I am sure that there are many homes in\r\nthe Southern States whose peace and happiness depend upon the\r\nconstruction of the Texas Pacific. Look at our two families. All the\r\nfuture prosperity of the Alamares and Mechlins is entirely based upon\r\nthe success of this road. If it is built, we will be well off, we will\r\nhave comfortable homes and a sure income to live upon. But if the Texas\r\nPacific fails, then we will be financially wrecked. That is, my father\r\nwill, and Don Mariano will be sadly crippled, for he has invested\r\nheavily in town property. For my part, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lose a great deal, but I\r\nhave my bank stock in New York to fall back upon. So my poor father and\r\nyours will be the worst sufferers. Many other poor fellows will suffer\r\nlike them\xe2\x80\x94for almost the entire San Diego is in the same boat with us.\r\nIt all depends on Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should Congress refuse to aid the Texas Pacific, knowing how\r\nnecessary the road is to the South? It would be wicked, George,\r\ndownright injustice, to refuse aid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it would, but if rumors are true, the bribes of the Central\r\nPacific monopolists have more power with some Congressmen than the sense\r\nof justice or the rights of communities. The preamble and resolution\r\nwhich Luttrell introduced last session were a \xe2\x80\x98flash in the pan,\xe2\x80\x99 that\r\nwas soon forgotten, as it seems. In that document it was clearly shown\r\nthat the managers of the Central Pacific Railroad Company were guilty of\r\nundeniable and open frauds. Enough was said by Luttrell to prove those\r\nproud railroad magnates most culpable, and yet with their record still\r\nextant, their power in Congress seems greater every year. Still, uncle\r\nwrites that Tom Scott is to make a big fight this winter, and that his\r\nchances are good. I am bound to hope that he\xe2\x80\x99ll win.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why has he to _fight_? What right have those men of the Central\r\nPacific to oppose his getting Congressional aid? Does the money of the\r\nAmerican people belong to those men, that they should have so much to\r\nsay about how it should be used? Is it not very audacious, outrageous,\r\nto come forward and oppose aid being given, only _because they don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to have competition_? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that their reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all. They have not an earthly _right_ to oppose the Texas\r\nPacific, and all their motive is that they _don\xe2\x80\x99t want competition_ to\r\ntheir Central Pacific Railroad. They have already made millions out of\r\nthis road, but they want no one else to make a single dollar. They want\r\nto grab every cent that might be made out of the traffic between the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t care how many people are\r\nruined or how many homes are made desolate in the South or in\r\nCalifornia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, George, but this is awful! If those men are so very rapacious and\r\ncruel, what hope have we? They will certainly sacrifice San Diego if\r\ntheir influence in Congress is so great! Poor San Diego! my poor,\r\nlittle, native town, to be sacrificed to the heartless greed of four or\r\nfive men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what claim have these men upon the American people? Think of that!\r\nHave they or their fathers ever rendered any services to the nation?\r\nNone whatever. All they rely upon is their boldness in openly asking\r\nthat others be sacrificed, and backing their modest request with money\r\nearned out of the road they built with Government funds and Government\r\ncredit. But they have tasted the sweets of ill-gotten gain, and now\r\ntheir rapacity keeps increasing, and in a few years\xe2\x80\x94if they kill the\r\nTexas Pacific\xe2\x80\x94they will want to absorb every possible dollar that might\r\nbe made on this coast. The only thing that will put a check upon their\r\nvoracity is the Texas Pacific. If this is killed, then heaven knows what\r\na Herculean work the people of this coast will have to destroy this\r\nhydra-headed monster, or in some way put a bit in each of its many\r\nvoracious mouths.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am awfully discouraged, George. I am so sorry that papa put all his\r\nmoney into town property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us yet hope Tom Scott might succeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd thus this young couple went on discussing San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s chances of\r\nlife or death, and their own hopes in the future. They were not the only\r\ncouple who in those days pondered over the problem of the \xe2\x80\x9c_to be or not\r\nto be_\xe2\x80\x9d of the Texas Pacific. It is not an exaggeration to say that for\r\nnearly ten long years the people of San Diego lived in the hope of that\r\nmuch-needed and well-deserved Congressional aid to the Texas Pacific,\r\nwhich _never came_! That aid which was to bring peace and comfort to so\r\nmany homes, which at last were made forever desolate!\r\n\r\nYes, aid was refused. The monopoly triumphed, bringing poverty and\r\ndistress where peace might have been!\r\n\r\nYet in those days\xe2\x80\x94the winter of \xe2\x80\x9974-\xe2\x80\x9975\xe2\x80\x94everybody\xe2\x80\x99s hopes were bright.\r\nNo clouds in San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s horizon meant misfortune. Not yet!\r\n\r\nAnd of all of San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s sanguine inhabitants, none surpassed in\r\nhopefulness the three friends who had invested so heavily in real\r\nestate, viz.: Mr. Mechlin, Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar and Mr. Holman. They exhorted\r\nall to keep up courage, and trust in Tom Scott.\r\n\r\n                                  \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nMany of the cattle sent to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s mines had returned to the rancho\r\nfrom the mountains, and now it was necessary to collect them again and\r\nsend them back.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano himself, accompanied by Victoriano and two of his brothers,\r\nwould start for the Colorado River, intending to see that the cattle got\r\nto the mines safely.\r\n\r\nThe evening before leaving Victoriano enjoyed the great happiness of\r\nseeing Alice by herself and talking to her of his love. For three long\r\nmonths her illness had kept her a close prisoner in her bedroom, and she\r\nhad not seen Tano.\r\n\r\nNow they enjoyed a two hours\xe2\x80\x99 _t\xc3\xa9te-\xc3\xa2-t\xc3\xa9te_, which was very sweet to\r\nthem, and which pleasure they had not had since Clarence left.\r\n\r\nMercedes\xe2\x80\x99 convalescence was very slow. Her despondency at Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nabsence retarded her recovery. The wounding of George had also impressed\r\nher painfully, for she was devotedly attached to him; and now she was\r\nworrying about her father having to go away.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano told her that as soon as the cattle were on the other side\r\nof the mountains he would not feel any apprehension of their running\r\naway; that once in the desert they would go straight to the river, but\r\nthat while in the mountains there was danger of their \xe2\x80\x9c_stampeding_\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nbeing lost. She heard all this, but still she dreaded her papa\xe2\x80\x99s going\r\nout of her sight. She could not forget that had he been at home when\r\nClarence came that last evening all might have been right. She had no\r\nfaith in human calculations any more. She was sick, and wanted her papa\r\nnear her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the best thing you can do is to send Mercita to town, to remain\r\nwith us while you are away,\xe2\x80\x9d George had said to Don Mariano, hearing how\r\nbadly she felt at his going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you are right. The surroundings at the rancho bring to her painful\r\nthoughts which will be gloomier when Tano and myself are away. She will\r\nhave the two babies, of whom she is so fond, to amuse her here,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides all of us, the Holman girls will be good company for her,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded George.\r\n\r\nMercedes, therefore, was told by her papa that she was to remain with\r\nElvira and Lizzie in town during his absence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, darling, I shall not cease to be anxious about you and Tano until\r\nI see your dear faces again. I am a thoroughly superstitious girl now.\r\nBut still, I do agree with you and poor, dear George, that the babies\r\nwill be a sweet source of consolation to me. Yes, take me to them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nplay chess or cards with George, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll amuse each other. He will\r\nread to me; he is a splendid reader; I love to hear him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes, therefore, was conveyed to town by her loving father, who went\r\naway with a much lighter heart, thinking that she would be less\r\ndesponding.\r\n\r\nThe _mayordomo_, with about twenty _vaqueros_, were nearly at the foot\r\nof the mountains with twenty-five hundred head of cattle, when Don\r\nMariano and Victoriano overtook them, and as the cattle had been resting\r\nthere for two days, their journey to the Colorado River would be resumed\r\nat daybreak.\r\n\r\nThe weather had been intensely cold for the last two days, so that the\r\nbenumbed animals could scarcely walk in the early morning, but now the\r\nair felt warmer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fear it is going to rain. We must try to reach the desert and leave\r\nthe storm behind us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano to his _mayordomo_.\r\n\r\nA good day\xe2\x80\x99s journey was made that day, and night overtook them as they\r\ndescended into a small valley, which seemed to invite them to rest\r\nwithin its pretty circumference of well-wooded mountain slopes, from\r\nwhich merry little brooks ran singing and went to hide their music among\r\nthe tall grasses that grew in rank solitude.\r\n\r\nThe bellowing of cattle and shouts of the _vaqueros_ soon awoke the\r\nmountain echoes, and the silent little valley was noisy and crowded with\r\nbusy life. Camp-fires were quickly lighted, from which arose blue\r\ncolumns of smoke, making the lonely spot seem well populated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith a good supper and good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest, we will make a long march\r\nto-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the _mayordomo_ to Don Mariano. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is plenty of\r\nfeed here for our cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the weather looks so threatening. I wish we were out of this,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, too. We are going to get a wetting,\xe2\x80\x9d added Tano.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight Don Mariano awoke, startled; he had heard nothing, and\r\nyet he awoke with a sense of having been summoned to arise. He sat up\r\nand looked around, but saw nothing. The darkness of the sky had changed\r\nfrom inky black to a leaden hue, and the clouds hung down among the tall\r\ntrees like curtains of ashy gray, draping them entirely out of view. The\r\nfires were out, and yet he did not feel cold. He thought it strange that\r\nall the fires should have burned out, when they had put on such heavy\r\nlogs before going to sleep. He struck a light to look at his watch, for\r\nhe had no idea what the hour might be. By the light he saw that his\r\nblankets seemed covered with flour. He brushed off the white dust, and\r\nfound that snowflakes had invaded even their retreat under the shelter\r\nof oak trees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere must have been some wind to blow this snow under the thick\r\nfoliage of these oaks,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, hurriedly putting his coat and shoes\r\non, these being the only articles of his dress he had removed, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\ndid not hear it. How stealthily this enemy came upon us. I fear it will\r\nbe a winding-sheet for my poor cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d He now proceeded to awake\r\neverybody, and a hard task it was, for the treacherous drowsiness spread\r\nover them with that snow-white coverlet was hard to shake off. But he\r\npersisted, and when he made believe he was losing his patience, then all\r\narose, slowly, reluctantly, but they were on their feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, boys, let us build fires, fires! Fires under every tree, if we\r\nhave to put up barricades to keep off snow-drifts. Come on; we must\r\ndrink coffee all night to keep us awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn a short time several fires were started under oak trees which had\r\nwidely-spreading branches or under pines which clustered together.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano had a consultation with his _mayordomo_, and both agreed\r\nthat it would be best to drive the cattle back for a few miles and wait\r\nuntil the snow had melted sufficiently for them to see the trails, else\r\nall might plunge unawares into hidden pitfalls and gulches covered over\r\nby snow-drifts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, this is our only course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, \xe2\x80\x9cand now we must start\r\nthem up. Sleep under snow cannot be any better for cattle than it is for\r\nmen. Let us have some coffee, and then we must whip up and rouse the\r\ncattle; they seem dead already; they are too quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was going back to the tree where he had slept, when he was met by his\r\nbrother Augustin, who came to say that Victoriano wished to see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? Still in bed?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, seeing Victoriano lying down. \xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo. Up with you, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here to me, father,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s voice, very sadly. His\r\nfather was quickly by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, I cannot stand up. From my knees down I have lost all feeling,\r\nand have no control of my limbs at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you rubbed them to start circulation? They are benumbed with the\r\ncold, I suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been rubbing them, but without any effect, it seems. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfeel pain though, nor cold either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the saddest perplexity yet. There was nothing to be done but to\r\nwait for daylight to take Victoriano home. In the meantime, a fire was\r\nmade near his bed. His limbs were wrapped in warm blankets; he drank a\r\nlarge cup of warm coffee and lay down to wait for the dawn of day to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nAs soon as all the herders had drank plenty of warm coffee, all mounted\r\ntheir horses, and the work of rousing the cattle began.\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the _vaqueros_, bellowing of cattle and barking of dogs\r\nresounded throughout the valley, the echo repeating them from hill to\r\nhill and mountain side. In a short time everything living was in motion,\r\nand the peaceful little valley seemed the battle-ground where a fiercely\r\ncontested, hand-to-hand fight was raging. The great number of fires\r\nburning under the shelter of trees, seen through the falling snow as if\r\nbehind a thick, mysterious veil, gave to the scene a weird appearance of\r\nunreality which the shouts of men, bellowing of cattle and barking of\r\ndogs did not dispel. It all seemed like a phantom battle of ghostly\r\nwarriors or enchanted knights evoked in a magic valley, all of which\r\nmust disappear with the first rays of day.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano and his two brothers also mounted their horses, but remained\r\nnear Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s bed to keep him from being trampled by cattle that\r\nmight rush in that direction.\r\n\r\nAbout four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the _vaqueros_ had a recess. They had put the cattle\r\nin motion, and could conscientiously think of cooking breakfast. By the\r\ntime that breakfast was over, daylight began to peep here and there\r\nthrough the thick curtains of falling snow. Giving to the _mayordomo_\r\nthe last instructions regarding the management of the cattle, Don\r\nMariano got Victoriano ready to start on their forlorn ride homeward. It\r\nwas no easy task to put him in the saddle, but once there, he said he\r\nwas all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a miserable chicken from my knees down, but a perfect gentleman\r\nfrom my knees up. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be sad, father; I\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right again soon,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid he, cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThe snow had not ceased falling for one moment, and if the _mayordomo_\r\nhad not been so good a guide they might not have found their way out,\r\nfor every trail was completely obliterated, and no landmarks could be\r\nseen. After a while, Don Mariano himself, aided by a pocket compass, got\r\nthe bearings correctly. The entire band of cattle were driven back, so\r\nthat all began their retreating march together, preceded by Victoriano,\r\nwith his limbs wrapped up in pieces of blanket, an expedient which he\r\nfound very ridiculous and laughable, suggesting many witticisms to him.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock they came to a grove of oak trees which covered a\r\nbroad space of ground and afforded good shelter for man and animals. Don\r\nMariano told his _mayordomo_ that he thought this would be a good place\r\nfor him to stay with the stock until the storm had passed, for although\r\nthe snow might fall on the uncovered ground, there would be shelter for\r\nall under the trees.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for an hour and eating a good luncheon, Don Mariano, aided\r\nby his brothers, again put Victoriano on horseback and started homeward,\r\nall the country being still enveloped in snow. About nightfall the snow\r\nwas succeeded by rain, and this was much worse, for it came accompanied\r\nby a violent wind which seemed as if it would blow them away with their\r\nhorses. Having left the _mayordomo_ and all but one _vaquero_ with the\r\ncattle, Don Mariano had with him only this one _mozo_ to wait on them,\r\nand his two brothers to assist him in the care of Tano. The night was\r\npassed again under the friendly shelter of trees, but in the morning it\r\nwas found necessary to ride out into the storm, for now Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlimbs ached frightfully at times, and it was imperative to reach home.\r\nThis was not done until the following day, when Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s malady had\r\nassumed a very painful character, and when Don Mariano himself had taken\r\na severe cold in his lungs. A doctor was immediately sent for, and now\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa had two invalids more to nurse.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks Don Mariano was confined to his bed with a severe attack\r\nof pneumonia, followed by a lung fever, which clung to him for many\r\ndays. In the latter part of January, however, he was convalescing. Not\r\nso Victoriano; his strange malady kept him yet a close prisoner. When\r\nhis father was out already, driving and riding about the rancho, poor\r\nTano had to be content with sitting by the window in an arm-chair, and\r\nlooking at that other window which he knew was in Alice\xe2\x80\x99s room. Everett\r\ncame daily to sit with him, to read to him, or play chess or cards, and\r\nhe helped the invalid to take a few steps, and little by little, Tano\r\nbegan to walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\xe2\x80\x94_A False Friend Sent to Deceive the Southerners._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat men are the Fire Pillars in this dark pilgrimage of mankind; they\r\nstand as heavenly signs, ever living witnesses of what has been,\r\nprophetic tokens of what may still be\xe2\x80\x94the revealed embodied\r\nPossibilities of human nature,\xe2\x80\x9d says Carlyle.\r\n\r\nIf conspicuousness or notoriety could mean greatness, we have our _great\r\nmen_ in California. But are they the Fire Pillars in our dark\r\npilgrimage? Verily, no. They are upas trees, blighting life, spreading\r\ndesolation, ruin, death upon all they overshadow. Only the cruelist\r\nirony could designate them as _heavenly signs_, for surely they march\r\nbefore us in the opposite direction from that in which heavenly Fire\r\nPillars would be expected to stand.\r\n\r\nAnd who are the most conspicuous in our State? The _monied men, of\r\ncourse_\xe2\x80\x94the monopolists. They are our _Fire Pillars_! Unfortunate\r\nCalifornia! if thou art to follow such guides, thy fate shall be to\r\n_grovel for money_ to the end of time, with not one thought beyond, or\r\nabove, money-making, and not one aspiration higher than to accumulate\r\nmillions greedily for rapacity\xe2\x80\x99s sake\xe2\x80\x94without once remembering the\r\nmisery that such rapacity has brought upon so many innocent people\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nblight it has spread over so many lives. Thy ambition shall be to\r\ncontrol the judiciary and utterly debauch the legislative branch of our\r\nGovernment; to contaminate the public press and private individual until\r\nthy children shall have lost all belief in honor, and justice, and good\r\nfaith, and morality. Until honesty shall be made ridiculous and\r\nsuccessful corruption shall be held up for admiration and praise.\r\n\r\nAnd are not _our_ \xe2\x80\x9cFire Pillars\xe2\x80\x9d dragging us already in that direction?\r\nblinding us instead of guiding and enlightening? Yes, alluring,\r\ntempting, making rapacity and ill-gotten wealth appear justifiable, seen\r\nthrough the seductive glamour of Success!\r\n\r\nThe letter Mr. James Mechlin received one morning about the latter part\r\nof November, 1875, would seem so to indicate. He and Mr. Holman met\r\noften at the postoffice each winter since 1872, always hoping to get\r\nrailroad news from Washington. These two gentlemen religiously went to\r\nthe postoffice every day again this winter\xe2\x80\x94particularly since the\r\nMechlins had taken their temporary residence in town\xe2\x80\x94and religiously\r\nthey expected that _good news_ would come at any time while Congress was\r\nin session\xe2\x80\x94news that a bill to aid in the construction of the Texas\r\nPacific Railroad had been passed. But days and days went by and no news\r\ncame. This morning, however, Mr. Mechlin received two letters from his\r\nbrother, the first he had got since he brought the wounded George to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nOne of these letters said that early in that month (November) Mr. C. C.\r\nhad taken east from California in his special car ex-Senator Guller, for\r\nthe purpose of being sent South _to persuade_ the Southern people into\r\nbelieving that the Texas Pacific Railroad would be injurious to the\r\nSouth; that it was being built for the benefit of Northern interests,\r\nbut that _the Southern Pacific_, of Mr. Huntington and associates, was\r\ntruly the road for the South. Mr. Huntington instructed Senator Guller\r\nin all the fictions he was to spread in the South, and with that burden\r\non his soul (if the old man has one), the hoary headed ex-Senator\r\nstarted from Washington about the 12th of November, 1875, on this errand\r\nto deceive, to betray. To betray cruelly, hiding under the cloak of\r\nfriendship and good will, the worst, blackest, most perfidious intent.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is going about the South making public speeches,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand using his influence to mislead Southern newspapers and Southern\r\ninfluential men; trying to convince all that the Texas Pacific will do\r\nthe South great harm. The Southern people and Southern Press have fallen\r\ninto the trap. They never doubted, never could doubt, the veracity of\r\nex-Senator Guller, who had espoused their cause during the war of the\r\nrebellion, and had always held Southern sentiments. Who could believe\r\nthat now, _for money_, he would go to deceive trusting friends? That,\r\n_for money_, he would cruelly mislead Southerners to their ruin? Who\r\nwould believe that this old man, calling himself a friend, was the\r\nveriest, worst, most malignant Mephistopheles, holding in the heart so\r\nwicked a purpose, such an infamous design?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the second letter Mr. Lawrence Mechlin spoke of ex-Senator Guller\r\nbeing still at work in the South, and that his patron, Mr. Huntington,\r\nseemed to think that the old man was not telling as many fictions as he\r\n(Huntington) wished. But that what more false statements he desired, it\r\ndid not appear, for in reality Dr. Guller had prevaricated and\r\nmisrepresented all that he could within the limits of possible\r\ncredibility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s letter added, \xe2\x80\x9cold man Guller will soon return\r\nfrom his Southern trip. Let us hope that the old man will be well paid\r\nfor his unsavory work. I cannot believe that in making his public\r\nspeeches he does not occasionally feel a pang of regret, of remorse,\r\nwhen seeing the faces of those unfortunate, betrayed Southerners\r\nupturned to him, listening in the sincerity of their hearts to the\r\natrocious concoctions which he is pouring upon their unsuspecting\r\nheads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. James Mechlin read to Mr. Holman this portion of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter, and both looked at each other in dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and talk with George about\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d When they had walked in silence a few minutes, Mr. Mechlin turned\r\nsuddenly around and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an idea. Let us (you, Don Mariano, and myself) go to see\r\nGovernor Stanford and find out from him directly whether they really\r\nmean to kill the Texas Pacific, or whether those tricks of Huntington\r\nare intended only as a ruse to bring Tom Scott to terms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut would Stanford tell us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether he does or not, by talking with him we will find out the\r\ntruth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the sending of Guller to the South can be a ruse only; it\r\nmust have cost them money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue. You are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin, sadly, resuming his walk. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nit proves conclusively that these men of the Central Pacific Railroad\r\nwill stop at nothing to obtain their end; and yet, I have always thought\r\nso well of Governor Stanford that I am unwilling to believe he is a\r\nparty to any trickery of Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn arriving home, Mr. Mechlin, followed by Mr. Holman, went directly\r\ninto George\xe2\x80\x99s room to lay before him his idea of interviewing Governor\r\nStanford. After listening attentively, George said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not the slightest doubt that the railroad men of the Central\r\nPacific wish to establish an iron-bound monopoly on the Pacific slope,\r\nto grasp all the carrying business of the entire coast, and to effect\r\nthat, they will do anything to kill the Texas Pacific, or any other road\r\nthat might compete with them. Still, as you are going to San Francisco\r\nto escort Lizzie, you can then, for your own satisfaction, have a talk\r\nwith Governor Stanford, and Mr. Holman and Don Mariano can join you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, after I see him, I shall know the truth whether he tells it to me\r\nor I see it myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall join you at any time. Let us go to see Don Mariano\r\nto-morrow and find out when he thinks he will be well enough to travel,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; I shall call for you about nine A.M.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin. Mr.\r\nHolman then arose, and, saying he wished to speak with the ladies and\r\ntry to forget railroads, went into the parlor. Mr. Mechlin followed him,\r\nsaying to George as he was leaving the room:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a lot of letters and papers that came this morning which I was\r\nalmost forgetting to give to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong the various letters of less interest to George, there was one from\r\nhis uncle, one from Bob Gunther and (would he believe his eyes!) one\r\nfrom Clarence! The sight of that writing made George start, and he\r\nimmediately thought of the effect it would have on Mercedes. He hastily\r\ntore open the envelope and found four letters besides the one for\r\nhimself. One was for Don Mariano, one for Gabriel, one for Tano, and one\r\nfor Mercedes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe noble fellow forgets no one,\xe2\x80\x9d said George, beginning\r\nto read his letter, and thinking it was best not to give to Mercedes\r\nhers until all the visitors had left, was soon absorbed in what Clarence\r\nsaid. Knowing that all would repeat the contents of his letters to one\r\nanother, Clarence related to each different incidents of his travels,\r\nleaving for Mercedes alone the recital of his heart\xe2\x80\x99s longings, and\r\nsufferings, and fears, and hopes. To George he related his travels in\r\nthe interior of Mexico, speaking with great enthusiasm of the\r\ntranscendent beauty, the sublimity of the scenery in that marvelous\r\ncountry. He had passed several weeks in the Sierra Madre, had ascended\r\nto the summits of Popocatepetl and Orizaba, viewing from the snow-clad\r\napex of this last named mountain, at an elevation of more than three\r\nmiles above the sea level, a vast panorama of the entire Mexico,\r\nbordered on each side by the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Clarence also\r\nspoke in highest terms of praise of the delta of the Sumasinta River,\r\nand beautiful scenery of the Rio Verde and Rio Lerma, and Chapala Lake,\r\nso large and picturesque that it looks like an ocean set apart by the\r\njealous gods so that men may not defile its beauty and break its silence\r\nwith the hurry scurry of commercial traffic. Clarence dwelt, also, upon\r\nhis visit to Yucatan, where he went more especially to see the ruins of\r\nUrmal. Those ruins which are the irrefragable witnesses of a past\r\ncivilization, lost so entirely that arch\xc3\xa6ology cannot say one word about\r\nits birth or death. Clarence found those ruins intensely interesting,\r\nand would have spent much longer time than the month he passed there,\r\nexamining, studying and admiring them, had his traveling companions been\r\nwilling to remain longer, but they were anxious to visit the City of\r\nMexico, and so he was obliged to leave those majestic ruins whose\r\nsilence spoke to him so eloquently. They seemed to him symbolical of his\r\nruined hopes, his great love, in fact, himself. Was he not like those\r\ncrumbling edifices\xe2\x80\x94a sad ruin of lofty aspirations? Poor Clarence, his\r\nsad heart was only made sadder when, upon his arrival at the City of\r\nMexico, he found no letters there. He inquired at the American Legation\r\nwhether any letters had come for him, and was told by the Secretary that\r\n_no letters_, but one package, only one, had been received, which had\r\nbeen kept for six months, at the end of which time Mr. Hubert Haverly\r\nhad written saying that if Mr. Darrell did not call for the package\r\nsoon, to return it to him (Haverly) at San Francisco. This had been done\r\nabout two weeks previously. On hearing this, Clarence sat down, wrote\r\nletters to all his friends, and then started for South America,\r\nintending to cross that continent and embark at Brazil for Europe. His\r\nletter to Mercedes he ended with these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not blame you for renouncing me, for it must be repugnant to you\r\nto unite yourself with one who has such rough blood in his veins. But,\r\nOh! Mercedes, can you not pity me enough to say one kind word? What have\r\nI done to deserve being the miserable outcast that I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes was in despair. Where could all their letters be? Why did he\r\nnot get them? He wrote to his mother, to Everett and Alice, and to them\r\nhe made the same complaint, and yet, all had written to him repeatedly.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin, accompanied by Mr. Holman, arrived at the rancho about\r\nluncheon hour. Their drive had given them a good appetite and they\r\nenjoyed their repast. After it, they all adjourned to the parlor to\r\ndiscuss, by the fire, their intended visit to San Francisco. Don Mariano\r\nwould have preferred to sit out doors on one of the verandas, but Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa reminded him that a whole year had passed since he was overtaken\r\nby that disastrous snow-storm, and he had not yet regained his usual\r\nhealth; neither had Victoriano. The injury to his health seemed even\r\ngreater and more difficult to remedy, for every two or three months he\r\nhad attacks more or less serious of the same lameness which deprived him\r\nof the use of his limbs.\r\n\r\nAs for the cattle, the poor, dumb brutes who had never seen snow, they\r\nbecame so frightened at the sight of that white pall, enveloping\r\neverything, that they were absolutely unmanageable after Don Mariano had\r\ngone in advance with Victoriano, and the _mayordomo_ thought they would\r\nwait until the storm had passed. Next day the _mayordomo_ went about in\r\nhopes of finding such stray animals as might have ran less wildly, but\r\nnone were to be seen, excepting those which lay stiff in death under the\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nThe loss of his cattle made it more imperative that Don Mariano should\r\nlook closely into land matters, into the prospects of a railroad for San\r\nDiego. He therefore listened attentively to what his friends said about\r\nMr. Lawrence Mechlin having written, and their proposed visit of inquiry\r\nto ex-Governor Stanford as to what might be the fate of San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me incredible that Doctor Guller should have lent himself\r\nfor such service, no matter how well paid,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he had\r\nbeen sent to deceive the North, to fool the Yankees, the errand would\r\nhave been\xe2\x80\x94if not more honorable\xe2\x80\x94at least less odious for a Southerner,\r\nnot so treacherous; but to go and deceive the trusting South, now when\r\nthe entire country is so impoverished, so distressed, that act, I say,\r\nis inhuman, is ignominious. No words of reprobation can be too severe to\r\nstigmatize a man capable of being so heartless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTruly, but the instigators are as much to blame as the tool they used.\r\nThey should be stigmatized also as corrupters, as most malignant,\r\ndebasing, unscrupulous men,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman. \xe2\x80\x9cMen who are harmful to\r\nsociety, because they reward dishonorable acts; because they reward,\r\nwith money, the blackest treason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible that Governor Stanford had any knowledge that his\r\nassociate was sending Doctor Guller on that disgraceful errand?\xe2\x80\x9d Don\r\nMariano queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like it, but let us hope he did not,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holman replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let us hope also that Mr. Lawrence Mechlin was misinformed, and\r\nDoctor Guller has not been guilty of anything so atrocious,\xe2\x80\x9d the Don\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided that the three friends would go to San Francisco\r\nat the same time that Lizzie would be going. She had made a flying visit\r\nto her family at San Diego, and Gabriel was calling loudly for her to\r\nreturn, saying that after banking hours he felt lonely and missed her\r\ndreadfully.\r\n\r\nLizzie, therefore, had three gentlemen for her escort, and in a few days\r\nthey all steamed away for the city of the sand dunes.\r\n\r\nThe first day in the city Don Mariano devoted to raising a sum of money\r\nby a mortgage on his rancho, as he needed the money to pay taxes on the\r\nland occupied by the squatters; but the day after, the three friends\r\npresented themselves at the railroad office and inquired for Governor\r\nStanford. They were told that he had just left the office, but that he\r\nwould be there on the following day. As they were leaving the office,\r\nthey met a Mr. Perin, a friend whom they had not seen for some time.\r\nWhen they had exchanged greetings, Mr. Perin asked them if they had come\r\nto see Governor Stanford. On being told that such was the case, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well that you did not see him, for he is not in a very good humor\r\nto-day, and as for Mr. C., he is like a bear with a sore head\xe2\x80\x94furious at\r\nTom Scott.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? What has Tom Scott done to anger his persecutors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nasked Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems they need money and can\xe2\x80\x99t raise as much as they want, while\r\nHuntington keeps clamoring for more to kill Tom Scott together with the\r\nTexas Pacific,\xe2\x80\x9d was the answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe earnings of the Central Pacific this last year were seventeen\r\nmillions of dollars. How are they in such need of money? Is not that\r\nenough to kill Colonel Scott?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do they want\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if their earnings had been seventy millions, these men would\r\nstill be in need of money,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Perin said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, as they wish to absorb all the carrying business of this\r\ncoast\xe2\x80\x94in fact, all sorts of business\xe2\x80\x94they want money, money, money. They\r\nwant to buy steamboats, ferry-boats, ocean steamers; street railroads\r\nand street cars; coal mines and farms; in fact, they want everything,\r\nand want it more when some poor devil loses his business thereby and\r\ngoes, frozen out, into the cold world. So you see, to go into such a\r\nvariety of business besides railroading and killing Tom Scott, it costs\r\nmoney. It takes millions and millions to kill and freeze out so many\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll be disappointed in killing Colonel Scott,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nMariano. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would mean death to many others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, too, but I hear that Mr. Huntington devoutly prays that a\r\nkind Providence may enable him \xe2\x80\x98_to see grass growing over Tom Scott_,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nMr. Perin replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my brother wrote me that Huntington does say that he hopes to\r\nworry Scott to death, and \xe2\x80\x98_see grass growing over his grave_.\xe2\x80\x99 I fear\r\nhe will see grass growing over many graves if he succeeds in killing the\r\nTexas Pacific,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is trying hard to do that, and his associates are backing him up\r\nwith millions,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Perin said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Heaven help us poor people who have invested our all, believing\r\nthat San Diego would have a railroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin, bitterly.\r\n\r\nNext morning the three friends went again to the railroad office and\r\nsent their cards to Governor Stanford. In a few minutes the servant\r\nreturned to say that the Governor was very busy, but if the gentlemen\r\ncould wait he would see them as soon as possible. The gentlemen waited;\r\nthey read the morning papers and looked over railroad guides to while\r\naway time.\r\n\r\nYes, they waited, but they would have spared themselves that trouble,\r\nand they would have never made that pilgrimage from San Diego to consult\r\nthe oracle at San Francisco, could they have read what Mr. Huntington\r\nwas about that time writing to his _associates_ concerning his _modus\r\noperandi_ in Washington to \xe2\x80\x9c_convince_\xe2\x80\x9d Congressmen to do as he wished,\r\nto defeat the Texas Pacific; writing all about sending an ex-Senator to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_switch off the South_,\xe2\x80\x9d and there to pretend to be an anti-subsidy\r\nDemocrat, and to state falsely that the Texas Pacific would injure the\r\nSouth. All this, however, was only known lately, when Mr. Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletters were made public. At that time the three friends, thinking it\r\nimpossible that the rights of Southern California would be so utterly\r\ndisregarded, did not see any absurdity in interviewing the Governor.\r\n\r\nWhile they waited they had an opportunity of hearing several instructive\r\nmatters freely mentioned. One of these was the way of avoiding the\r\npayment of taxes, and how to fight the cases in the courts. The\r\ngentlemen who discussed the subject evidently understood it and were\r\nwaiting to have an audience. Their talk suggested a very sad train of\r\nthoughts to Don Mariano, as he heard that the railroad people did not\r\nmean to pay taxes, and would resist the law. He thought how those\r\nmillionaires would pay no taxes, and defy the law openly and fight to\r\nthe bitter end, whilst he was not only obliged to pay taxes upon a too\r\nhighly appraised property, but must also pay taxes for the land occupied\r\nby the squatter and on the improvements thereon! As a necessary sequence\r\nto such unjust, unreasonable, inhuman taxation, Don Mariano had been\r\nobliged to mortgage his rancho to raise funds to pay the taxes of the\r\nsquatters. With the yearly sales of his cattle he had always been able\r\nto pay his own taxes as well as those of his unwelcome neighbors, but as\r\nhis cattle were now lost, his only resource was his land. Not yet having\r\nthe patent, he could not sell to advantage at all. He must therefore\r\nmortgage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a railroad prince, I suppose I would not be forced to pay\r\ntaxes for the squatters on my land,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano to his friends,\r\nsmiling sadly to hear how the taxes on railroad property were to be\r\nfought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were a railroad prince, you would not pay your own taxes, much\r\nless those of the squatters,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you ought not to hesitate to use the money that Clarence paid\r\nfor your cattle. If they ran away, it was not your fault,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not my fault, but my misfortune; a misfortune which I have no right\r\nto put on Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. I did not deliver the cattle; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake the pay. I am going to mortgage my land, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t avoid it,\xe2\x80\x9d Don\r\nMariano replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certainly a very hard case to have to mortgage your property to\r\npay taxes for the squatters,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf these railroad men will only let us have the Texas Pacific all will\r\nbe right, but if not, then the work of ruining me begun by the squatters\r\nwill be finished by the millionaires\xe2\x80\x94if they kill our railroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nDon Mariano sadly, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cOur legislators then will complete their\r\nwork. Our legislators began my ruin; our legislators will end it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\xe2\x80\x94_San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s Sentence is Irrevocable._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter waiting in the reception room for nearly two hours, Don Mariano\r\nand his two friends were at last ushered into the presence of\r\nex-Governor Stanford. He was so well hid behind his high desk, that\r\nlooking around the empty room, Mr. Holman observed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope this is not to be a second stage of waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanford arose, bowing from behind his desk, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe seated, gentlemen. Excuse my having kept you waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d Then seeing\r\nthat there were but two chairs near by, and only one more at the\r\nfurthest corner of the room, he added, going to bring the chair: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthought that there were chairs for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano, too, had started for the same chair, now that its existence\r\nwas discovered, but the Governor got there first, and brought it half\r\nway, then the Don took it and occupied it.\r\n\r\nWhen all were seated, Governor Stanford said in his low, agreeable\r\nvoice, which any one might suppose would indicate a benevolent, kind\r\nheart:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can I do for you, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDon Mariano laughed outright. The situation struck him as being\r\neminently ridiculous. Here was this man, who held pitilessly their\r\ndestiny in his hands\xe2\x80\x94held it with a grip of iron\xe2\x80\x94and not one thought of\r\nthe distress he caused; he, through his associate, Huntington, was\r\nlavishing money in Washington to kill the Texas Pacific, and thus snatch\r\naway from them (the three friends) the means of support, absolutely\r\ndeprive them of the necessaries of life, and he asked them what he could\r\ndo? and asked it with that deep-toned, rich melody of voice which\r\nvibrated softly, as if full of sympathy, that overflowed from a heart\r\nfilled with philanthrophy, generosity and good will. This was a sad and\r\ncruel irony, which to Don Mariano made their position absurd, to the\r\npoint of being laughable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is like laughing at a funeral,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, apologetically.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease pardon me. What made me laugh was that I felt like answering you\r\nby saying, \xe2\x80\x98Governor, you can do for us all we ask.\xe2\x80\x99 But\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it out. But what?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Governor, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will do nothing for us,\xe2\x80\x9d finished Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, for San Diego,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Mechlin, afraid that it might\r\nseem as if they came to ask a personal favor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! it is of San Diego that you wish to speak to me? Then, truly, I\r\nfear I can do nothing for you,\xe2\x80\x9d the Governor said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can hear what we wish to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holman interposed,\r\nwith a sickly effort at smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. But really, gentlemen, you must excuse me for saying that I\r\nam very busy to-day, and can only give you a half hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all bowed.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin and Don Mariano looked at Mr. Holman, as it was understood\r\nthat he would be spokesman. But Mr. Holman\xe2\x80\x99s heart was leaping with the\r\nindignation of a lion, and then shrinking with the discouragement of a\r\nmouse into such small contractions\xe2\x80\x94all of which he in no way must\r\nreveal\xe2\x80\x94that for a minute he could not speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the San Diego people wish me to build them a railroad, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthat it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the man of power, slowly arranging some papers on his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr to let some one else build it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\nThe Governor colored slightly, in evident vexation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTom Scott, for instance,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sneeringly. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my advice,\r\ngentlemen, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you pin your faith on Tom Scott. He\xe2\x80\x99ll build no\r\nTexas Pacific, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why don\xe2\x80\x99t you build it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it won\xe2\x80\x99t pay,\xe2\x80\x9d was the dry reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy won\xe2\x80\x99t it pay? We have plenty of natural resources, which, if\r\ndeveloped, would make plenty of business for two railroads,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holman\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the San Diego people say so. No one else thinks of San Diego\r\nCounty, but as a most arid luckless region, where it never rains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the talk of San Francisco people, Governor, because they want\r\nall the railroads to come to their city, and nowhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don\r\nMariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have less rainfall in Southern California, on an average, but on\r\naverage, too, we get better crops than in the northern counties in dry\r\nyears. How it is I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, unless it be that a given quantity of\r\nrain is all that crops require, and above that it is superfluous, or\r\nelse that for certain soils a certain amount of rainfall is all that is\r\nrequired. It is undoubtedly true that in dry years more crops have been\r\nlost in some of the northern counties than in ours,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, but when we have such magnificent wheat country in our\r\nnorthern valleys, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be supposed that we can give any attention\r\nto San Diego.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf our county does not take the lead as wheat-growing, it certainly can\r\ntake it as fruit-growing. We have no capital to make large plantations\r\nof vineyards or trees, but what has been done proves, conclusively, that\r\nfor grapes, olives, figs, and in fact all semi-tropical fruits, there is\r\nno better country in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be so, but you see we are not engaged in the fruit-growing\r\nbusiness. We build railroads to transport freight and passengers. We do\r\nnot care what or who makes the freights we carry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. But surely there cannot be any reason why, if San Diego should\r\nhave freights and passengers to be carried, that we should not have a\r\nrailroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly not. If you can get it, do so, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Governor, that is why we came to talk with you. _Is San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath sentence irrevocable?_ Is it absolutely determined by you that San\r\nDiego is not to have a railroad?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is a hard question to answer. No, perhaps for the present\r\nSan Diego will _not_ have a railroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with cool nonchalance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call _for the present_? How long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a harder question yet. You see, if we effect a compromise with\r\nMr. Scott, we will keep on building the Southern Pacific until we meet\r\nhis road, and then, as all the Eastern freight can come by the Southern\r\nPacific, there will not be any necessity of another railroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, San Diego must be strangled. There will not be any\r\nTexas Pacific?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not in California,\xe2\x80\x9d the Governor calmly asserted, passing over the\r\nsubject as of no consequence, if a hundred San Diegos perished by\r\nstrangulation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the terms of the Southern Pacific charter were you not to build to\r\nSan Diego?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that is to say, through San Diego to the Colorado River, but that\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t suit us at all. Still, I think that after a while, perhaps,\r\nwhen we have more time, we might build to San Diego from some point of\r\nthe Southern Pacific that we see is convenient,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as if it\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what the terms of the Southern Pacific charter were,\r\nknowing that Congress would not enforce them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little branch road,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that is all we think is necessary for our purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to sum up, what we must understand is, that San Diego cannot hope\r\nto be a western terminus of a transcontinental railway; that all we may\r\nhope to get is a little branch road from some point convenient to the\r\nSouthern Pacific Railroad.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stanford bowed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holman\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cby right, San Diego is the terminal point of a\r\ntranscontinental railway, and San Diego ought to be the shipping point\r\nfor all that immense country comprising Arizona, Southern California and\r\nNorthern Mexico. We are more than five hundred miles nearer to those\r\ncountries than San Francisco, thus you will be making people travel six\r\nhundred miles more than is necessary to get to a shipping point on the\r\nPacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much more business for our road,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stanford said, laughing, in a\r\ndignified way, and slightly elevating his eyebrows and shoulders, as if\r\nto indicate that really the matter hardly merited his consideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut without asking or expecting you to take any sentimental or\r\nphilosophic or moralizing view of our case _as a benefactor_, will you\r\nnot take into consideration, as a business man, the immense benefit that\r\nthere will be to yourselves to have control of the trade which will be\r\nthe result of uniting Southern California with Arizona, with the\r\nSouthern States and Northern Mexico, and developing those vast countries\r\nnow lying useless, scarcely inhabited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; we have thought of that, I suppose, but we are too busy up\r\nhere. We have too much business on hand nearer us to think of attending\r\nto those wild countries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Governor, let some one else attend to them. We have only one life\r\nto live, and, really, much as we would like to await your pleasure, we\r\ncannot arrest the march of time. Time goes on, and as it slips by, ruin\r\napproaches us. We invested all our means in San Diego, hoping that\r\nColonel Scott would build his railroad. Now we see plainly that unless\r\nyou withdraw your opposition to Scott we are ruined men, and many more\r\ninnocent people are in the same situation. So we come to you and say, if\r\nyou will not let any one else build us a railroad, then do build it\r\nyourself. It will save us from ruin and give you untold wealth. We will\r\nbe glad to see you make millions if we only secure for ourselves our\r\nbread and butter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur bread; never mind the butter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you at least have plenty of cows to make butter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nStanford, addressing Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar, evidently wishing to avoid the\r\nsubject, by turning it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. The squatters at my rancho shot and killed my\r\ncattle, so that I was obliged to send off those that I had left, and in\r\ndoing this a snow-storm overtook us, and nearly all my animals perished\r\nthen. The Indians will finish those which survived the snow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose Indians are great thieves, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; but not so bad to me as the squatters. The Indians kill my\r\ncattle to eat them, whereas the squatters did so to ruin me. Thus,\r\nhaving now lost all my cattle, I have only my land to rely upon for a\r\nliving\xe2\x80\x94nothing else. Hence my great anxiety to have the Texas Pacific.\r\nMy land will be very valuable if we have a railroad and our county\r\nbecomes more settled; but if not, my land, like everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s land in\r\nour county, will be unsaleable, worthless. A railroad soon is our only\r\nsalvation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stanford said, looking at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nhow I can help you San Diego people. If Mr. Huntington effects some\r\ncompromise with Mr. Scott, we will then build a branch road, as I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what if there is no compromise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, of course, there will be no road for you\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, no Texas\r\nPacific in California.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, Governor? \xe2\x80\x98Live and let live,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to think of business principles. You forget that in\r\nbusiness every one is for himself. If it is to our interest to prevent\r\nthe construction of the Texas Pacific, do you suppose we will stop to\r\nconsider that we might inconvenience the San Diego people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a matter of inconvenience\xe2\x80\x94it is ruin, it is poverty,\r\nsuffering, distress; perhaps despair and death,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin. \xe2\x80\x9cOur\r\nmerchants, our farmers, all, the entire county will suffer great\r\ndistress or ruin, for they have embarked their all in the hope of\r\nimmediate prosperity, in the hope that emigration would come to us,\r\nshould our town be the western terminus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have been more cautious; not so rash.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could we have foreseen that you would prevent the construction of\r\nthe Texas Pacific?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasily. By studying business principles; by perceiving it would be to\r\nour interest to prevent it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never thought, and do not think now, that it is to your interest to\r\nprevent it. But even if we had thought so, we would not have supposed\r\nthat you would attempt it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it would have seemed to us impossible that you could have\r\nsucceeded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy impossible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause we would have thought that the American people would interfere;\r\nthat Congress would respect the rights of the Southern people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Stanford laughed, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThe American people mind their business,\r\nand know better than to interfere with ours. All I can tell you,\r\ngentlemen, is that if Mr. Scott does not agree to come no further than\r\nthe Colorado River, he shall not be able to get the interest of his\r\nbonds guaranteed by our Government, which means that he will not have\r\nmoney to build his road\xe2\x80\x94no Congressional aid at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem very sure of Congress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure of what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Governor, the Government helped you to build your roads, why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou let it help ours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with an angry expression, like a dark\r\nshadow passing over his face. \xe2\x80\x9cWho told you that the Government helped\r\nus to build the Southern Pacific?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Government gave you a grant of many millions of acres to help build\r\nit, as the Central Pacific was constructed with Government subsidies,\r\nand the earning of the Central Pacific were used to construct the\r\nSouthern Pacific, it follows that you were helped by the Government to\r\nbuild both,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are talking of something you know nothing about. The help the\r\nGovernment gave us was to guarantee the interest of our bonds. We\r\naccepted that help, because we knew that, as private individuals, we\r\nmight not command the credit necessary to place our bonds in the market,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. As for the land subsidy, we will pay every cent of its price\r\nwith our services. We do not ask of the Government to give us anything\r\ngratis. We will give value received for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is certainly a very ingenious view to take of the whole matter,\r\nand so viewing it, of course the killing of the Texas Pacific seems\r\njustifiable to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarlyle, in your place, would not view your position like that,\r\nGovernor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano, rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor Herbert Spencer, either. His ideas of what you call business\r\nprinciples are different,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, what would those great thinkers say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCarlyle would think you are much to blame for flinging away a\r\nmagnificent chance to be great and heroic. Carlyle worships heroes, but\r\nhis idea of heroism is not only applicable to warriors and conquerors,\r\nbut to any one capable of rising to a high plane of thought or heroic\r\nendeavor, doing acts which require great self-denial for our\r\nfellow-beings, for humanity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, with no view or expectation of\r\nreward in money,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin said.\r\n\r\nThe Governor smiled, and with the least perceptible sneer he asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how does Mr. Herbert Spencer differ with my ideas of business\r\nprinciples?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe differs in this, that he thinks that commercial honor, business\r\nmorality, should be based on strict rectitude, on the purest equity.\r\nThat so soon as any one in the pursuit of riches knowingly and wilfully\r\nwill injure any one else, that he then violates the principle upon which\r\ncommerce should rest,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holman replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is absurd. Would he stop competition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all. Competition generally has the effect of securing the\r\npreference to whomsoever deserves it. No, what Mr. Spencer maintains is\r\nthat monopolies should not exist when they have become so powerful that\r\nthey defy the law, and use their power to the injury of others. The\r\nfundamental principle of morality is then subverted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFundamental morality forbids us to injure any one because we would be\r\nbenefited by that injury,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same old axiom of the French revolution, that \xe2\x80\x98the rights of one\r\nman end where those of another begin.\xe2\x80\x99 Danton and Marat sang that to the\r\nmusic of the guillotine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Governor, a little bit\r\ncontemptuously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so; but you see, Governor, the devil might sing psalms, and it\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the psalms,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have made you waste your time talking to us, Governor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nHolman; \xe2\x80\x9ccan we not hope that you will reconsider this matter, and\r\nexamine more carefully the advantages of making San Diego the direct\r\noutlet for all that country that needs a railroad so much? Believe me,\r\nsir, such road will bring you more millions than the Central and\r\nSouthern Pacific Railroads. If you do not build it, and prevent Col.\r\nScott from building it, sooner or later some one else will, for it\r\nstands to reason that such a magnificent enterprise will not be left\r\nneglected after other less advantageous routes are tried. Then you will\r\nhave the regret of having spurned this golden chance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides the chance of making millions for yourselves. Think of the\r\nblessings you will bring to so many hearts who are now sadly\r\ndiscouraged, and will be desolate if our hopes are frustrated,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nMechlin said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorporations have no souls, gentlemen, and I am no Carlylean\r\nhero-philanthropist. I am only a most humble \xe2\x80\x98_public carrier_.\xe2\x80\x99 I do\r\nnot aspire to anything more than taking care of my business,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nStanford answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Governor, you cannot be indifferent to the distress your action\r\nwill cause?\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Mr. Mechlin, with sad earnestness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Stanford, smiling; \xe2\x80\x9cif I don\xe2\x80\x99t cause distress\r\nsome one else will. Distress there must be, bound to be in this world,\r\nin spite of all that your philanthropists might do or say to prevent\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you not think that if all and every one of those who have it in\r\ntheir power to be beneficent were not so indifferent to human suffering,\r\nbut were to be benevolent, that then the combined result would be great\r\nalleviation and diminution of human distress?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; because those who have power to do good are very few, and the\r\nimprovident, the vicious, the lazy are in myriads; and they and their\r\nfolly and vices and improvidence will, forever, more than counterbalance\r\nthe good that the beneficent might effect,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stanford asserted.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin arose and turned towards the door. Mr. Holman followed his\r\nexample. Se\xc3\xb1or Alamar looked sadly at the floor, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Governor, I am sorry we have failed in bringing you to our way of\r\nthinking. Time will show who is mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! Time will show. We can\xe2\x80\x99t cast any astrological horoscope at\r\nthe birth of a railroad. All we can do is to take care that it thrives.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo clear away competition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. The country is not settled enough yet to divide profits.\r\nBesides, we think that Eastern people ought not to build any roads to\r\nthe Pacific Coast, when we of California are ready to do it. Let Tom\r\nScott keep away. We don\xe2\x80\x99t build roads in Pennsylvania.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you sure you will always be able to prevent a competing road?\r\nWould it not be cheaper for yourself to build than to fight Tom Scott?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed. For the present, it is cheaper to fight. It don\xe2\x80\x99t cost so\r\nmuch money to make friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou seem very confident of success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoney commands success, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, money is everything! And it weighs not a feather, all the ruin and\r\nsqualor and death you will bring to a people who never harmed you! Not a\r\nfeather\xe2\x80\x99s weight, as against the accumulation of money for yourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Mr. Mechlin, forgetting his usual consideration for others\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I did not cause this misery you apprehend, some one would. Be sure\r\nof it, for there will always be misery in the world, no matter who\r\ncauses it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Governor replied, with an air of being satisfied with\r\nhis philosophy, inasmuch as he was to be exempt from human suffering, no\r\nmatter who went under.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin, still lingering sadly, and veiling his great disapprobation\r\nof Mr. Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s practical philosophy, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Herbert Spencer also, in elucidating his principles, reminds us of\r\nthe fact that \xe2\x80\x98Misery is the highway to _death_, while happiness is\r\nadded life, and the giver of life.\xe2\x80\x99 Think of this, Governor. Surely, you\r\ndo not wish to make us so miserable that you cause _death_! Yes, death\r\nfrom poverty and despair. Poverty, overwork and discouragement are the\r\ncauses of sickness and death oftener than it is supposed, and this Mr.\r\nSpencer also maintains unswervingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a very vivid imagination; you color up things too dark,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe Governor, also rising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you will not be sorry to have thought so. I hope you will not\r\nregret that you closed your heart and your mind against us, against\r\njustice, humanity and reason.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, Mr. Mechlin slowly walked off;\r\nthen at the door he turned, and lifting his finger, said to Don Mariano:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel a prophetic warning that neither you nor I will ever see light\r\nin this world. These men\xe2\x80\x94this deadly, soulless corporation, which, like\r\na black cloud, has shut out the light from San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s horizon\xe2\x80\x94will\r\nevermore cast the shadow that will be our funeral pall. But let them\r\nlook to it, they might yet carry their heartless rapacity beyond limit.\r\nThe mighty monopoly, that has no soul to feel responsibility, no heart\r\nfor human pity, no face for manly blush\xe2\x80\x94that soulless, heartless,\r\nshameless monster\xe2\x80\x94might yet fall of its own weight.\xe2\x80\x9d So saying, Mr.\r\nMechlin walked away, as if he intended this prophecy to be a parting\r\nsalutation to the men who had blighted his life and made him utterly\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\xe2\x80\x94_The Sins of Our Legislators!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98_Assey de Bonaparte!_\xe2\x80\x99 cried France, in 1814. Men found that his\r\nabsorbing egotism was deadly to all other men,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Emerson. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwas not Bonaparte\xe2\x80\x99s fault. He did all that in him lay to live and thrive\r\nwithout moral principle. It was the nature of things, the eternal law of\r\nthe man and the world, which balked and ruined him; and the result in a\r\nmillion experiments would be the same. Every experiment by multitudes or\r\nby individuals, that has a sensual or selfish aim, will fail. The\r\nPacific Fourier will be as inefficient as the pernicious Napoleon. As\r\nlong as our civilization is essentially one of property, of\r\nexclusiveness, it will be mocked by delusions. Our riches will leave us\r\nsick; there will be bitterness in our laughter, and our wine will burn\r\nour mouth. Only that good profits which serves all men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, only that good profits which does not represent the misery of\r\nothers; only that wine should be sweet which is not drunk when the tears\r\nof those we have rendered desolate are silently running over pale cheeks\r\nfrom eyes that have kept the vigil of want, mourning for the beloved to\r\nwhom poverty brought death!\r\n\r\nIn heavenly-inspired words Emerson and Carlyle and Herbert Spencer have\r\nrepeated those burning aphorisms, but our California \xe2\x80\x9c_Fire Pillars_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ndiffer with them\xe2\x80\x94differ widely and differ proudly.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanford says that if _he_ did not cause misery some one else would,\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x9c_misery there must always be in this world_!\xe2\x80\x9d Sound philosophy,\r\ntruly! Why should he recoil from adding to the sum total of human misery\r\nwhen so many others do the same!\r\n\r\nMr. Huntington was about the same time writing from Washington that he\r\n_would_ \xe2\x80\x9c_see the grass grow over Tom Scott_\xe2\x80\x9d before he stopped his work\r\nof _convincing_ Congressmen. And he kept his word.\r\n\r\nHe carried _conviction_ to Washington, distress to the South and ruin to\r\nSan Diego.\r\n\r\nMr. Crocker was answering, \xe2\x80\x9c_Anything to beat Tom Scott!_\xe2\x80\x9d The thing was\r\nto prevent the construction of San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s railroad, no matter to whom\r\nruin came thereby. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter how many were sacrificed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing was more hopeless, therefore, than to suppose that any of those\r\nmen would swerve one iota from their course of greedy acquisition, out\r\nof respect for equity or humanity.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken until the three saddened friends reached Don\r\nMariano\xe2\x80\x99s parlors at the hotel. They had walked silently out of the\r\nrailroad building, silently taken the street car and silently walked out\r\nof it, as it happened to stop in front of their hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we have failed sadly, but I am glad to have had the chance of\r\nstudying that piece of humanity, or rather I should say inhumanity,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nMechlin exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow confident he is of their power over Congress! And he certainly\r\nmeans to wield it as if he came by it legitimately. He is proud of it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nadded Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but he is wrong to be proud of a power he means to use only for\r\nselfish ends. Sooner or later the people will get tired of sending men\r\nto Congress who can be bought so easily. I am disappointed in Governor\r\nStanford. I thought him much more just and fair; a much higher order of\r\nman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Don. \xe2\x80\x9cHow coolly he laughed at us for quoting Carlyle and\r\nSpencer! As if he would have said, \xe2\x80\x98You quote the philosophers,\r\ngentlemen, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the millions. You might die in poverty, _I_\r\nshall revel in wealth.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have quoted Emerson, when he says: \xe2\x80\x98I count him a great man\r\nwho inhabits a higher sphere of thought into which other men rise with\r\nlabor and difficulty.\xe2\x80\x99 This might have pointed out to him how groveling\r\nit is never to rise above the mere grubbing for money. No, he is not\r\nhalf as large-minded as I had believed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can he be if he is cognizant of the means employed by Huntington to\r\ndefeat all legislation in favor of the Texas Pacific?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr.\r\nHolman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I fear now the Governor gives his sanction to Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s work. I\r\nnever believed it before. I am disappointed in the Governor as much as\r\nin our fruitless errand,\xe2\x80\x9d the Don said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow irksome and distasteful it is for him to hear about \xe2\x80\x98_the rights of\r\nothers_.\xe2\x80\x99 He almost takes it as an insult that any one but himself and\r\nassociates should have _rights_; and he seems to lose all patience at\r\nthe mention of the distress they have brought upon the people of San\r\nDiego and the financial ruin that their rapacity and heartless conduct\r\nwill cause the Southern people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice how he\r\nfrowned at the allusion to the fact that the Central Pacific was built\r\nwith Government money? The mere mention irritates his nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he suppose we don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they had no money, and that it was\r\nwith capital _given_ as absolute gifts, or loaned to them on the\r\nguarantee of the Government, that they built and are building their\r\nroads?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin. \xe2\x80\x9cI never saw such complete subversion of the\r\nlaws of reasoning as these men exhibit. Good luck has made them think\r\nthat to genius they owe success. Thus their moral blindness makes them\r\ntake as an insulting want of proper deference any allusion to those\r\n_rights of others_ which, in their feverish greed, they trample. For\r\nthis reason they hate San Diego, because San Diego is a living proof of\r\ntheir wrong-doing; a monument reminding California of their deadly\r\negotism, of the injury done by unscrupulous men to their fellow-men.\r\nHence, my friends, I say that San Diego must have no hopes while those\r\nmen live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you are right, and as I have invested in San Diego all I\r\nhave in the world, I see no hope; nothing but hard-featured poverty\r\nstaring me in the face,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Holman, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it were owing to natural laws of the necessities of things that San\r\nDiego is thus crippled, our fate would seem to me less hard to bear,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid Don Mariano; \xe2\x80\x9cbut to know that the necessities of commerce, the\r\ninevitable increase of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population, the development of our\r\nState, all, all demand that Southern California be not sacrificed, _and\r\nyet it is_, and our appeals to Congress are of no avail! All this adds\r\nbitterness to our disappointment. Yes, it is bitter to be reduced to\r\nwant, only because a few men, without any merit, without any claims upon\r\nthe nation\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude, desire more millions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus the disheartened friends discoursed, fully realizing their terrible\r\nproximity to that financial disaster which was sure to overtake them. In\r\nthe generosity and kindness of their hearts, they felt added regret,\r\nthinking of so many others who, in San Diego, were in the same position\r\nof impending ruin; so many good, worthy people, who certainly did not\r\ndeserve to be thus pitilessly sacrificed; so many who yet clung to the\r\nhopes of '72, when all rushed to buy city lots; so many out of whose\r\nhopes three years of disappointment had not quenched all life. The\r\nfailure of Jay Cook in the fall of \xe2\x80\x9973 had made the financial heart of\r\nAmerica shrink with discouragement and alarm, but San Diego did not\r\nrealize how much her own fate was involved in that sad catastrophe, and\r\ncontinued her gay building of proud castles in the air and humble little\r\ncottages on the earth\xe2\x80\x94very close to the earth, but covered with fragrant\r\nflowers, with roses, honeysuckles and fuchsias. These little one-story\r\nwooden cottages were intended for temporary dwellings only. By and by\r\nthe roomy stone or brick mansions would be erected, when the Texas\r\nPacific Railroad\xe2\x80\x94the highway of traffic across the continent\xe2\x80\x94should\r\nbring through San Diego the commerce between Asia and the Atlantic\r\nseaboard, between China and Europe. San Diego lived her short hour of\r\nhope and prosperity, and smiled and went to sleep on the brink of her\r\nown grave, the grave that Mr. C. P. Huntington had already begun to\r\nexcavate, to dig as he stealthily went about the halls of our National\r\nCapitol \xe2\x80\x9coffering bribes.\xe2\x80\x9d But such \xe2\x80\x9cfoul work\xe2\x80\x9d was then only surmised\r\nand scarcely believed. It was reserved for Mr. Huntington himself to\r\nfurnish proof that this was the fact. His letters were not published\r\nuntil years after, but the world has them now, and the monopoly, with\r\nall its power, cannot gainsay them.\r\n\r\nThe three friends were yet discussing this painful topic of their\r\npilgrimage, when Mr. Mechlin observed that Don Mariano was looking very\r\npale, and asked if he felt ill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI feel very cold. I feel as if I was frozen\r\nthrough and through. When we were at the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s office I felt very\r\nwarm, and when we came out my clothing was saturated with perspiration.\r\nNow I feel as if I had been steeped in ice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis won\xe2\x80\x99t do. You must change your clothes at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mechlin.\r\n\r\nMr. Holman also became alarmed at seeing the bluish pallor of his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is a congestive chill,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, hurrying off to call the\r\ndoctor, who resided at the hotel, and who fortunately was at home.\r\n\r\nPrompt and efficient medical attendance saved Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s life, but he\r\nwas too ill to leave his bed for several days. His two friends remained\r\nwith him, writing home that business matters detained them.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa did not feel anxious; she thought that her husband was busy\r\nnegotiating a loan on his land, and this detained him.\r\n\r\nGabriel and Lizzie also were in constant attendance, and thus the sick\r\nman was kept in a cheerful frame of mind, a thing much to be desired in\r\nsickness always, but more especially in his case, accustomed as he was\r\nto be surrounded by a loving family.\r\n\r\nStill he was anxious to return home. Reluctantly the doctor allowed him\r\nto do so, hoping that the salubrious climate of Southern California\r\nwould be beneficial. But he said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let you go on condition that you pledge me your word to be very\r\ncareful not to get into a profuse perspiration and then rush out into\r\nthe cold air. If your lungs had not been originally so healthy and\r\nstrong you could not have rallied so soon, if ever; but they are yet\r\nfilled with phlegm, and the least cold might give you pneumonia.\xe2\x80\x9d To\r\nGabriel the doctor repeated the same words of warning, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cNot only\r\nis the condition of your father\xe2\x80\x99s lungs very precarious, but also that\r\nof his heart. He must not task either too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel was thoroughly alarmed at hearing the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and\r\nimmediately wrote to his mother how careful his father ought to be, and\r\nhow she should watch him.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano tried to be careful, but having been very healthy all his\r\nlife, he did not know how to be an invalid, nor guard against fresh\r\ncolds.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks had elapsed since his return from San Francisco, when a\r\nnotice that many of his city lots would be sold for taxes brought Don\r\nMariano to town. He still held to the belief that a railroad to San\r\nDiego would surely be built at some future day, but had ceased hoping to\r\nsee that day. However, he would willingly have waited for a rise in real\r\nestate before selling any of his city property, but he saw it was\r\nruinous for him to pay taxes\xe2\x80\x94taxes for town property and taxes for\r\nsquatters\xe2\x80\x94it was too much; so he reluctantly concluded that it would be\r\nbest to lose a great many lots (yes, whole blocks), permitting them to\r\nbe sold for taxes, hoping to redeem them on the following year if Tom\r\nScott was more successful with the Texas Pacific. Mr. Mechlin and Mr.\r\nHolman did the same, and many other unlucky ones followed their\r\ndiscouraging examples. Thus city lots by the hundreds were sold every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano saw his city property thus sacrificed before his eyes at\r\npublic sale, just as he had seen his cattle buried under the snow. He\r\nsubmitted in both cases to the inevitable without a murmur; but this\r\ntime the blow seemed heavier. He was pecuniarily less able to bear it,\r\nand being in bad health and discouraged, his misfortunes were more\r\ndepressing. He rode home saddened indeed.\r\n\r\nVictoriano, who was now able to be about (but said he _mistrusted_ his\r\nlegs), was with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you use some of that money Clarence sent you? I am\r\nsure he would approve your doing so, and feel glad, _very_ glad, indeed,\r\nthat you did it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano, when they had driven for a long time\r\nwithout uttering a word.\r\n\r\nDon Mariano turned sharply and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I use Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s money?\r\nIf I had delivered the cattle to Fred Haverly, as it was agreed I\r\nshould, then I would have a right to take from Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s money the\r\nprice of the cattle delivered. But having delivered no cattle, I take no\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverett was saying that Clarence distinctly stated to his father that\r\nthe cattle in the Alamar rancho with your brand were all his, and would\r\nbe driven as soon as the weather permitted. Mr. Darrell thinks that the\r\ncattle lost belonged to Clarence, and not to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darrell is wrong, then. I cannot expect to be paid for cattle I did\r\nnot deliver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he says you had sold them already. If they were lost on the way it\r\nwas neither your fault nor your loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but was my misfortune, not Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cattle were going to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s mines, which goes to prove that\r\nthey had been bought by him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot view the matter like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Don Mariano said, and Victoriano\r\nsaw his mind was settled upon the subject, and it was best not to annoy\r\nhim by insisting in opposition.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived home they found that Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa had received a\r\ntelegram from Gabriel, sent the night before, saying that he, Lizzie and\r\nthe baby would spend Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day at the rancho. This\r\nwas glad news, indeed, and most unexpected, for inasmuch as Lizzie had\r\njust been down on a visit and hurried back, so that Gabriel would not be\r\nall alone on Christmas, they did not think that Lizzie would want to\r\ntake the trip so soon again. But Lizzie would travel many more miles to\r\nbe with her family. And the reason that Gabriel had for coming was,\r\nmoreover, a most powerful one.\r\n\r\nHe had one day casually met the doctor who attended his father, and\r\nafter inquiring whether Don Mariano was better, added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you frankly, Don Gabriel, your father may yet live many years,\r\nbut he is in danger, too, of dying very suddenly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Why so?\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel asked, pale with alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause his heart may give out if his lungs don\xe2\x80\x99t work well, and as he\r\nis not very careful of himself, you see he might task his heart with\r\nheavier work than it can perform. If he is kept from excitement and gets\r\nrid of all that phlegm which has accumulated in his lungs, he will be\r\nwell enough. So write to him to be careful in avoiding colds,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go and tell him so myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is right. The case is serious, I assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis short dialogue brought Gabriel home.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he had entered the bank he had never been absent from it\r\none minute during office hours, so a three weeks\xe2\x80\x99 vacation was readily\r\ngranted to him.\r\n\r\nAll the Mechlins would come to Alamar to pass the holidays. George told\r\nhis father that they might as well go back to their home again since his\r\nlameness did not require daily medical attendance.\r\n\r\nMr. Mechlin replied that they would decide upon that after New Years,\r\nbut he was evidently pleased at the prospect of returning to Alamar.\r\n\r\nThe Alamar house looked once more as it had in the days of old, before\r\nsquatters invaded the place; it was full of people, and music and\r\nlaughter resounded under the hospitable roof. Mercedes, however, sat\r\nsilent, and though she smiled her own sweet smile, it was too sad; it\r\nfailed to deepen the cunning little dimples as it did in other days. The\r\nDon and Mr. Mechlin, too, were not as cheerful as they used to be. In\r\nthat visit to San Francisco \xe2\x80\x9c_a change came over the spirit of their\r\ndream_,\xe2\x80\x9d and it seemed to have come to quench the light of their lives.\r\n\r\nBut the young people wanted to decorate the house with green boughs and\r\nhave a huge Christmas-tree, and the Don himself went to help them to get\r\npine branches and red \xe2\x80\x9c_fusique_\xe2\x80\x9d berries. The tree would be in honor of\r\nhis two grandchildren; they were now eighteen months old, and the proud\r\nmammas said they were so intelligent that they would surely appreciate\r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\nEverett, Alice, Rosario and Victoriano were the committee on\r\ndecorations; Carlota, Caroline, Lucy and Webster were the committee on\r\nrefreshments. While the laughter of the young people came ringing out\r\nthrough the parlor windows, Don Mariano and Mr. Mechlin slowly walked up\r\nand down the back veranda in earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin said, as if to reiterate some previous assertion,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyes, I have lived my allotted term; my life is now an incumbrance\xe2\x80\x94nay,\r\nit is a burden on those who love me. If I were not living, George could\r\ntake his wife, his mother and sister, to reside in New York, but because\r\nI cannot live in that climate, all those dear ones remain in this\r\nexile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should you call it exile? They don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is; and even if\r\nit were, my friend, you have no right to cut your life off at your\r\nwill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Don Mariano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Life is a free gift, and often a very onerous one. Why keep\r\nit, when to reject it would be preferable? when it would release others\r\nfrom painful obligations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you sure that the grief and horror of knowing that you took\r\nyour own life would not be a million times worse than the supposed exile\r\nyou imagine to be so objectionable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps so; but I assure you, since I have lost all my money, and when\r\nI am too old to make another fortune, my health has begun to fail again.\r\nI hate life without health, and these constant annoyances of financial\r\ndifficulties will end by prostrating me on a sick-bed again. Now, when I\r\nhave lost nearly all the money I invested in San Diego, now they come\r\ndown on me to pay a note of ten thousand dollars which I endorsed, with\r\nfive others. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t the others pay their share? I am willing to pay\r\ntwo thousand dollars, but not the entire sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should, either. What does your lawyer say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe shrugs his shoulders, caresses his side-whiskers, and says he\r\n_thinks_ that some of the other indorsers are insolvent, because their\r\nproperty has depreciated so much that it would bring nothing if sold;\r\nwhile those that have some means, no doubt, put everything out of their\r\nhands, so I am left alone to pay the entire sum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sad dialogue of the grandpapas was now interrupted, as they were\r\ncalled to witness the glee of the babies at the sight of the illuminated\r\nChristmas-tree. When the surprise of first sight was over, little\r\nMariano Mechlin stretched out both hands for the colored candles. His\r\nuncle Tano gave him a tin trumpet, teaching him how to blow it;\r\nwhereupon baby Mechlin gave the company a blast, and looked so surprised\r\nat his own performance, and gazed around so triumphantly and yet so\r\nperplexed, that he made everybody laugh. Josefita looked at her cousin\r\ndistrustfully and gave her arms to her papa, as if she thought Marianito\r\nwas entirely too martial for the vicinity of peaceful babies like\r\nherself. Gabriel took her near the tree to select any toy she liked. She\r\nfancied a string of bright balls, which her father gave her. The babies\r\nwere allowed to be in the parlor for nearly an hour, and they were so\r\nbright, trying to repeat what was taught them, that it was really\r\namusing to watch them. Marianito sang for the company; all were\r\nsurprised to hear so young a baby sing so well. None enjoyed more\r\nheartily their cunning ways than the two grandfathers, especially Don\r\nMariano, and both babies clung to him when the nurses came to take them\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nWhen the babies had made their exit, the children of larger growth had\r\ntheir music and dancing until ten, supper being then announced. On\r\nreturning to the parlor, after supper, the clock upon the mantel struck\r\ntwelve; at the same time a curtain ran up, and an altar was disclosed to\r\nview, tastefully decorated in the Roman Catholic style, having statues\r\nof the Virgin Mary, the divine infant, enveloped in fleecy drapery, and\r\nSt. Joseph standing by his side. Behind the cradle were three magi, and\r\nfurther off, the hills of Judea were seen. As all the company were Roman\r\nCatholics, all entered into the spirit of the commemoration, and joined\r\nwith true feeling in the carol led by Mrs. Darrell and Alice. Other\r\nsacred songs were sung, and then all retired for the night; the Darrells\r\npromising to come on the following evening to have another dance,\r\nbecause\xe2\x80\x94said Victoriano\xe2\x80\x94it must be celebrated that they had heard from\r\nClarence, and that he had found his legs, meaning that he (Tano) had\r\nagain the use of his limbs.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day was passed very happily, and in the evening the young\r\npeople assembled in the parlor for a dance. Don Mariano excused himself\r\nto Mr. Mechlin, saying he felt badly, and thought that he ought to be in\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAt about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock he sat up in bed and looked around as if wishing\r\nto speak. Gabriel and Mercedes were sitting by his bed, and promptly\r\nasked if he wished for anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sins of our legislators have brought us to this,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed,\r\nleaning back. Presently he said: \xe2\x80\x9cCall your mother, my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel called his mother, who being in the next room, talking with Mrs.\r\nMechlin, was quickly by his side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall Elvira and Tano. Call Carlota and Rosario and George. Call all,\r\nall, quickly! I fear, my beloved son, I fear I am dying! Bring all my\r\ngirls; I must bless them all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMercedes had her arms around him. He looked at her lovingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy baby, kiss me. Tell Clarence I bless him with my last breath.\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\nvoice began to fail him, but his eyes seemed glowing with an intensity\r\nthat was startling. He sat up again, looking at each one of the anxious\r\nfaces around his bed. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you all, my beloved ones,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPapa, darling, can\xe2\x80\x99t we do something to relieve you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mercedes.\r\nHe shook his head and whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo late. The sins of our legislators!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel pain, father?\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot now,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered, extending his hand to George as if to say\r\ngood-by. He looked again to see whether every one of his family was\r\nthere; he forgot no one; he seemed anxious to see them all for the last\r\ntime. He extended his arms to his wife; she came to him. \xe2\x80\x9cPray for me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe whispered, moving his lips as if in prayer, and leaning on Gabriel,\r\nwho held him, closed his eyes and sighed. A few aspirations followed\r\nthat last sigh, and all was over\xe2\x80\x94his noble soul had passed away.\r\n\r\nFor some moments no one believed that his lofty and noble spirit had\r\nleft the earth, but when the truth was at last realized, the scene of\r\ngrief, of heart-rending agony, that followed would be impossible for me\r\nto describe.\r\n\r\nClosely in the sad train of this mournful event, and as a fitting sequel\r\nand a complement of such dire misfortune, another disaster, more\r\nunexpected, more dreadful and tragic, followed, which must now be\r\nrelated. It shall be told as briefly as possible.\r\n\r\nA few days had passed after the funeral, and the Alamar family were\r\nstill in town. Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa and Mercedes were at the Mechlins.\r\nVictoriano, Carlota and Rosario were at the Holmans; that is, they slept\r\nthere, but as Mercedes was again prostrated with fever, they, as well as\r\nthe Holmans, divided their time between the two houses.\r\n\r\nOne morning Mr. Mechlin arose from the breakfast table and said he was\r\ngoing hunting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go far, James; you are too weak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Mechlin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think, papa, you ought not to carry that heavy gun. You eat nothing,\r\nand walk too far, carrying it,\xe2\x80\x9d Caroline said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you carry it for me?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take George\xe2\x80\x99s, too, and go with you, if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll permit me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, going towards his room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think papa has taken to heart the death of Don Mariano more than any\r\none sees,\xe2\x80\x9d said Caroline.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he has; he has hardly slept or eaten enough to sustain life\r\nsince that awful night,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Mechlin said, \xe2\x80\x9cand constantly talks about\r\nsoon joining his best friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have observed how very sad he is. I wrote uncle to come; I think to\r\nsee his brother will be great consolation to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said George.\r\n\r\nThe report of a gun was heard in Mr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s room, and all jumped to\r\ntheir feet. Gabriel was the first to run and got to the room in advance\r\nof the others. He found Mr. Mechlin shot through the heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, God! Was it accidental?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Mechlin exclaimed, clasping her\r\nhusband to heart. The dying man smiled, whispering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo not mourn for me; it is best so; I shall be happier.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked\r\nlovingly at the anxious faces surrounding him, and closed his eyes\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\xe2\x80\x94_The Fashion of Justice in San Diego._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf those kind eyes of the Goddess of Justice were not bandaged, but she\r\ncould see how her pure white robes have been begrimed and soiled in San\r\nDiego, and how her lofty dignity is thus lowered to the dust, she would\r\nno doubt feel affronted and aggrieved. And if she is so irreverently\r\nmaltreated, can she afford any protection to those who must rely on her\r\nalone, having no riches to maintain protracted litigation or carry their\r\nplaints to higher tribunals? To the moneyless laity Justice thus defiled\r\nseems as helpless as themselves. She is powerless to accomplish her\r\nmission upon earth whenever a Judge, through weakness or design, may\r\nchoose to disregard her dictates. At present the dignity of a Judge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npersonality is more sacred than the abstract impersonality of justice.\r\nBecause the accepted theory being that Judges are always just and\r\nincorruptible (and generally the supposition is correct), there is a\r\nbroad shelter for a Judge who may be neither just nor impartial. What\r\nmockery of justice it is in our fair land of freedom to say that a bad\r\nJudge can be impeached when impeachment is so hedged with difficulties\r\nas to be impossible\xe2\x80\x94utterly ineffectual to protect the poor, victimized\r\nlaity! Who is the poor litigant that would dare arraign an unjust Judge,\r\nwell sheltered in his judicial ermine, and the entire profession ready\r\nto champion him? \xe2\x80\x9c_Libel_\xe2\x80\x9d would be the cry against any one who would\r\ndare hold the mirror for such Judge to see himself! Ah, yes, when the\r\nreal libel is to distort the law and degrade the mission of justice on\r\nearth!\r\n\r\nPeter Roper, knowing well with what impunity he could violate justice\r\nand decency, conceived the brilliant idea of taking the Mechlin house at\r\nAlamar, now that the family were sojourning in town. Peter did not like\r\nto divide the spoils, but as accomplices were absolutely necessary,\r\nthere was no alternative but to take his friend and client Gasbang into\r\nthe plot.\r\n\r\nOn a Sunday evening Peter proceeded to unfold his plan before John, who\r\nhad come from his farm to attend church and was attired in a white vest\r\nand black coat, having just come from evening service. For, as I have\r\nsaid before, John Gasbang was a pillar of the church now, and never\r\nfailed in his attendance every Sunday. People knew that in old times,\r\nwhen John was very poor, he used to play \xe2\x80\x9c_monte_\xe2\x80\x9d with the Indians and\r\ncheat them out of their money. Many times he had been known to spend\r\nalmost the entire night sitting cross-legged on a blanket with a tallow\r\ncandle set in a bottle to light his high-toned game, surrounded by the\r\nselect company of naked Indians, who were too fascinated to see how\r\nplainly John was robbing them. Pitilessly would John strip his\r\nunsophisticated tattooed comrades of everything they owned on this\r\nearth. Their reed baskets, bows and arrows, strings of beads, tufts of\r\nfeather-tips, or any other rustic and barbaric ornaments. All, all, John\r\nwould gather up with his skillfully shuffled cards. The spoils he thus\r\ncollected he would sell to other Indians from whom he would presently\r\ngather in (like the good Sexton he was), gather in, with high-toned and\r\nhighly skillful shuffling. But John now was a rich man. Kindly San Diego\r\nhad forgiven John\xe2\x80\x99s petty thieving. The money won from the poor Indians\r\nhad helped him to thrive, and consequently convinced him that, after\r\nall, cheating was no worse than other sins, the gravity of which\r\nentirely depended upon the trick of hiding them. He would now try to\r\nhide his humble, predatory gambling, he said to himself, and seem\r\nrespectable.\r\n\r\nYes, he would wear a white vest and try to look honest, but on hearing\r\nRoper\xe2\x80\x99s project, his dull, fishy eyes revolved quickly in their little\r\nsockets, and his square jaws expanded like those of a snake before it\r\nshakes its rattle and coils up to spring. His mouth watered in\r\nanticipation of the sweets of ill-gotten gain as he listened attentively\r\nto all that Roper had to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll see Hogsden the first thing in the morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, joyously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut wait. Can you trust him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrust him? I should say I could, and if he weakens, there is his wife\r\nto brace him up with her good advice. He owes a big sum of money to old\r\nMechlin; so old Hoggy will be only too glad to get even by jumping the\r\nhouse. I suppose our friend, the Judge, is with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be silly. Do you suppose I would do a thing of this kind if I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure of him? He won\xe2\x80\x99t fail me. He\xe2\x80\x99ll do as I say. Be sure of\r\nthat, and don\xe2\x80\x99t talk. Come to my house now and I\xe2\x80\x99ll draw up the\r\nconveyance. Hog. must sign his quit-claim deed, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll see that\r\nhis location of one hundred and sixty acres is properly filed. But,\r\nmind, if Hogsden betrays us, he\xe2\x80\x99ll spoil our game,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Roper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave that to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said John, rubbing his hands and giving his vest a\r\ndownward pull.\r\n\r\nThe result of this dialogue was that Hogsden quit-claimed all his,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cright, title and interest in a certain parcel of land, etc., etc., with\r\na dwelling house and other improvements, etc., etc.,\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\ndescription of the property might have applied to a hundred others in\r\nthe county. This transaction accomplished and recorded, they took the\r\nfurniture that had been left in the house by the Mechlins and put it\r\ntemporarily in the barn; Mrs. Hogsden taking only such articles as she\r\nwished to keep. She stole them brazenly, saying she had bought them.\r\n\r\nIt was further agreed that they would work the farm in partnership,\r\ndividing profits equally, and a contract in writing to this effect was\r\nsigned by them.\r\n\r\nRoper now being a property holder, besides being so influential with\r\n_the_ Judge, thought he could soar to higher altitudes. By the\r\nassistance of Gasbang and a few others, whom he said belonged to his\r\n_gang_, he managed to get himself nominated for Representative to\r\nCongress. Bursting with pride, puny Peter started on his way to glory,\r\nto _stump_ his district. He would begin at San Bernardino and carry the\r\ncounty by storm, with the force of his eloquence and personal magnetism,\r\nhe said, with characteristic modesty.\r\n\r\nHe made speeches at San Pascual, and Poway, and San Bernardo, and Bear\r\nValley, and Julian, but his greatest effort, the achievement that would\r\ncrown his brow with laurels, that effort he reserved for Los Angeles.\r\nQuite a big crowd was marshaled to hear him. He had paid a good deal of\r\nmoney in advertisements so as to collect an audience. He succeeded; a\r\ncrowd was there ready to make up in quantity what it lacked in quality.\r\n\r\nRoper came forward. His face was red as usual, but he seemed sober\xe2\x80\x94he\r\nstood straight. He was as loquacious as ever, of course, and talked\r\nincessantly for quite a while, making the crowd laugh. After he had all\r\nhis audience in a laughing mood with his coarse anecdotes and broad\r\njokes, he thought he would capture their votes beyond a doubt if he then\r\nand there proved himself\xe2\x80\x94by his own admissions\xe2\x80\x94to be _low_, the lowest\r\nof the lowly\xe2\x80\x94so very low, so very disreputable, that no one could be\r\nlower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my sympathies as well as my\r\ninterests, are with you, the working people, the poor who must work or\r\nstarve. I have nothing in common with bloated bondholders or pampered\r\nmonopolists who have enriched themselves with the earnings of the poor.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I came to be a lawyer. I suppose it happened because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like to work. I would rather talk and let others work. [Laughter.]\r\nI am a child of the people, and _for_ the people\xe2\x80\x94the poor people I mean.\r\nMy mother was a cook, a poor cook\xe2\x80\x94poor in pocket I mean. Her cookery may\r\nhave been rich [laughter], but upon that point I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t enlighten you,\r\nfor I have forgotten the flavor of her dishes. But she was a cook by\r\nprofession, just as I am a lawyer by profession, and one is as good as\r\nthe other. [Laughter.] As for my father, of him I know nothing to speak\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94literally\xe2\x80\x94[laughter], so the less said on that head, the sooner\r\nmended; for if the fact of my being here goes to prove _to you_ that I\r\nhad a father, that is all the proof _I_ ever had myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere Peter laughed, but he laughed alone. He thought that a burst of\r\nlaughter and applause would follow this last shameless, revolting\r\nadmission, but not a sound was heard. He had overstepped the bounds of\r\ndecency so far, that even such a crowd as made his audience was silent\r\nas if unanimous disgust was beyond utterance. Roper was evidently\r\ndisconcerted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be represented in Washington by a fellow who exults in\r\ndegradation and has no respect for the memory of his mother,\xe2\x80\x9d said a\r\nloud voice, and the crowd began to disperse.\r\n\r\nSoon Peter\xe2\x80\x99s native impudence came to his aid and he tried to recommence\r\nhis discourse. \xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you going? You ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngoing to send my mother to Congress! Did you think I came to ask you to\r\nvote for her?\xe2\x80\x9d He went on in this coarse, bantering style which had\r\ntaken so well at first, but in vain. Nobody wanted to hear him now. It\r\nseemed as if the ghost of the poor reviled cook had come, like that of\r\nBanquo, to frighten off the audience. In a few minutes only about half a\r\ndozen of his supporters had been left, and they remained to scold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said one, looking back at the receding crowd, \xe2\x80\x9cthat cake is all\r\ndough, Peter. I hope your mother would have made a better job of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA delightful dough,\xe2\x80\x9d said another; \xe2\x80\x9cand his goose is well cooked. I\r\nsay, Peter, you cooked your goose brown, browner than your mother ever\r\ncooked hers, and I bet on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPeter answered with an oath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe worst of it is, that in cooking your goose, you burnt ours to a\r\ncinder. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t the ghost of a chance now, and the Republican\r\ncandidate will have a walk-over to Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d said a third supporter.\r\n\r\nAlas for human delusions! This fiasco was the crowning glory of Roper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npolitical campaign. Like the celebrated ambitious toad which cracked its\r\nsides by the force of its own inflation, Peter came to grief,\r\nignominious grief; that is to say, it would have been ignominious to any\r\none not thoroughly inoculated with disgrace as he, _according to his own\r\nversion_, must have been from the day of his birth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask you a question, Roper,\xe2\x80\x9d said a fourth friend. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you\r\nbring out such a thing against your mother? It was your misfortune as\r\nlong as you kept quiet about it, but now it is your shame. What was the\r\ngood of telling against your own mother? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that people,\r\neven the humblest, must censure and despise you for it? Few, very few\r\ndecent men, like to have anything to do with a man who reviles his dead\r\nmother, no matter if she was a poor cook. What pleasure can you find in\r\nproclaiming your shame?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRoper laughed loud and derisively, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you bet that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have just as good and just as many friends\r\nin San Diego as I ever had before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that the people of San Diego _approve_ of language\r\nsuch as you used to-night? Approve your conduct?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind about that, only will you take my bet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe henchman shrugged his shoulders and walked off, but if he had taken\r\nthat bet, he would have lost.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Hornblower received the news of Roper\xe2\x80\x99s fiasco, it occurred\r\nto him that he would take a trip to Europe. He had now made money enough\r\nout of the troubles and distress he and Roper brought upon others, to\r\nindulge in that luxury, the pleasure of saying he had been to Europe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Colonel to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cI think now is the best time\r\nto take that trip to Europe we have had in our hearts for so long. Get\r\nready; let us go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Colonel Hornblower asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, except that that partner of mine made a fiasco of his\r\npolitical campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Colonel related to his swarthy lady Roper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspeech, and how it was received.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow absurd! so unnecessary!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly, but you see, for a man of _my_ dignity the thing is awkward.\r\nWhat will the town say of _me_, *ME*?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe town will say nothing. As long as Roper has the friendship of Judge\r\nLawlack he can have clients; and as long as he has clients the San Diego\r\npeople will be indulgent to him, no matter how debased he says he is.\r\nHowever, drop him, and let\xe2\x80\x99s go to Europe. I wish we could get letters\r\nto distinguished people abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for? Our American ministers can present us to the best society,\r\nand besides, I am sure I am well known abroad. My name\xe2\x80\x94the name of\r\nColonel Hornblower\xe2\x80\x94must be as familiar to Europeans as the names of\r\nother distinguished Americans. I am the most prominent man in San Diego.\r\nAll the world knows San Diego, all the world must know Colonel\r\nHornblower.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill, I would like to get letters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all necessary, I assure you. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell our minister in England\r\nthat Mrs. Colonel Hornblower wishes to be presented to Queen Victoria,\r\nand he\xe2\x80\x99ll present you. The Queen, no doubt, will wish to make our\r\nacquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to see other royal people. I would like to see the Pope,\r\nalso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall see as many princes and princesses as you like. We Americans\r\nare princes, all of us. We are the equals of princes. As for the Pope, I\r\nwould not take one step to make his acquaintance, unless he met me half\r\nway; but if you like to see him, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get an introduction easily.\r\nPerhaps he might invite us to dinner. If he does, I hope it won\xe2\x80\x99t be on\r\nFriday, as fish don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he ever invite people to dinner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDistinguished people, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Hornblowers sailed for Europe before Roper returned from his\r\nstumping tour. He was detained at Los Angeles, where he had been beaten\r\nso badly in a bar-room brawl that he was obliged to keep in bed for\r\nseveral days. The Colonel then wisely slipped off for Europe, to hob-nob\r\nwith royal people and take dinner with the Pope, perhaps.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hornblower conjectured rightly. Roper\xe2\x80\x99s disgrace was condoned by\r\nSan Diego, because he was under the patronage of Judge Lawlack, and in\r\nSan Diego everybody has a law suit.\r\n\r\nBut has the Judge no moral responsibility in this? _Has he the right to\r\nimpose upon the community_ a man so self-debased and noxious? If the\r\nJudge were to withdraw his support Peter would collapse like a pricked\r\ngas-bag, to be swept off into the gutter. But the Judge is the genii,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_the Slave of the Ring_\xe2\x80\x9d and his power keeps the little gas-bag afloat,\r\nsoaring as high as it is in the nature of little gas-bags to soar. The\r\nJudge keeping in his hand the check-string, kindly preventing him from\r\ngoing to destruction.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic coarseness, amounting to inhumanity, Peter Roper and\r\nGasbang decided to throw down their masks, and reveal their fraud in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_jumping_\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s house. They came to this decision about ten\r\ndays after Mr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\n\r\nGabriel had returned that same day from San Francisco, where he had\r\naccompanied the remains of his father-in-law, and deposited them in a\r\nvault to await until Mrs. Mechlin should be able to travel, when she,\r\nwith all the family, would go East.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence Mechlin had also arrived. He started from New York on the\r\nday of his brother\xe2\x80\x99s death, two hours after receiving George\xe2\x80\x99s telegram\r\nconveying the terrible news. He reached San Francisco on the night\r\nbefore the steamer for San Diego sailed. Thus he and George came\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Sheriff presented himself to announce to Mrs. Mechlin that\r\nher furniture left at her country house had been taken out by order of\r\nPeter Roper, and put on the road about two miles from the house. As Mrs.\r\nMechlin was too ill to see any one, excepting the members of her family,\r\nthe Sheriff made his statement to George, in the presence of his uncle\r\nand Gabriel, just arrived.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings seemed so atrocious that at first no one could\r\nunderstand the Sheriff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that Peter Roper claims to own our house, and\r\nbecause he is the owner, has taken out the furniture and left it lying\r\non the road?\xe2\x80\x9d asked George.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was told to say,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sheriff replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why? How is he the owner of our house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he and Gasbang bought it from Hogsden, who located a claim\r\nthere after you abandoned the place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe trick was infamous. George and Gabriel saw through it. There was\r\nnothing to do but to bring a suit in ejectment to get rid of them, but\r\nin the meantime they would hold possession (perhaps for years), and that\r\nwas what they wanted, to get the property into litigation.\r\n\r\nGabriel went to state the matter to the lawyer who had attended to Mr.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s law business, and he corroborated their opinion, that there\r\nwas no other course to pursue but to file a complaint in ejectment to\r\ndispossess the thieves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no quicker way to obtain redress?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawyer answered; \xe2\x80\x9cas the deed is done by Peter Roper and\r\nJohn Gasbang, the Judge will decide in their favor, and you will have to\r\nappeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut this is atrocious,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lawrence Mechlin said; \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say\r\nthat people\xe2\x80\x99s houses can be taken like that in this country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot generally; but Peter Roper might, if there is the ghost of a\r\npretext, and if there is a dishonest servant, like Hogsden, left in\r\ncharge, who will steal and help to steal; then, you see, the thing is\r\neasy enough, as long as the Judge befriends trespassers. But the Supreme\r\nCourt will put things to right again. That is to say, if the Judge\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfindings are not a string of falsehoods which will utterly mislead the\r\nSupreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis property, Mr. Mechlin had repeatedly said, he intended should be a\r\nhomestead for his wife, so the suit in ejectment was brought in her\r\nname. She at the same time filing a petition for a homestead before the\r\nProbate Court, and asking that Gabriel Alamar be appointed administrator\r\nof her husband\xe2\x80\x99s estate.\r\n\r\nAll this would, of course, involve the property in tedious legal\r\nproceedings, there being the probate matters, beside the suit in\r\nejectment to litigate in the District Court. The attorney employed in\r\nthe case advised George to have a deed executed by Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa,\r\nconveying the property to Mrs. Mechlin, as it had been agreed before the\r\ndeath of their husbands that it should be done. Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa cheerfully\r\nassented, remembering that Don Mariano had said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I should die before I get my land patented, the first thing you must\r\ndo is to make a conveyance of his place to Mr. Mechlin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shock caused by his father\xe2\x80\x99s death when that of Don Mariano was yet\r\nso recent, acted most injuriously upon George\xe2\x80\x99s health. It made him\r\nfeverish, inflaming his wound again very painfully, as the ball had\r\nnever been extracted; now it chafed the wound, and gave him as much pain\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mechlin, Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa and Mercedes were also in their beds,\r\nsuffering with nervous prostration and night fevers. It seemed\r\nimpossible that people could be more bereaved and disheartened than\r\nthese ladies, and yet exist. Mr. Lawrence Mechlin saw that George must\r\nhave skillful medical attendance without delay, and wanted his own\r\ndoctor to take him under his care. So he and Gabriel arranged all\r\nbusiness and other matters in order that George should go East. It was\r\nheart-rending to Elvira\xe2\x80\x94the mere thought of leaving her mother and\r\nsister sick, and all the family in such distress\xe2\x80\x94but she must go with\r\nher husband. Gabriel would attend to the lawsuits. He had powers of\r\nattorney from George and Mrs. Mechlin, and was the administrator.\r\n\r\nThe answer to Mrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s complaint was a masterpiece of unblushing\r\neffrontery that plainly showed it had originated in a brain where brazen\r\nfalsehoods and other indecencies thrived like water-reptiles growing\r\nhuge and luxuriating in slimy swamps. The characteristic document ran in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\n    _In the District Court of the \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 of the County of San Diego,\r\n    State of California._\r\n\r\n    _Beatrice Mechlin_, _Plaintiff_,\r\n\r\n    _v._\r\n\r\n    _Peter Roper_, _John Gasbang_, and _Charles Hogsden_,\r\n    _Defendants_.\r\n\r\n    And now come the defendants, Peter Roper, John Gasbang and\r\n    Charles Hogsden, and for answer to plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, on\r\n    file herein, they and each of them say:\r\n\r\nThat they deny that in the year of 1873, or at any other time before or\r\nafter that date, James Mechlin was owner of the premises described in\r\nthis complaint; deny that the said James Mechlin ever purchased from\r\nWilliam Mathews the aforesaid property or any part thereof, or paid any\r\nmoney or any other valuable consideration; deny that the said Mechlin\r\never built a house, or planted trees, or resided on the said property\r\nhimself, with his family, or by agent or servant occupied said premises;\r\ndeny that respondent, Charles Hogsden, was ever put in charge of the\r\naforesaid premises or any part thereof, as the agent, or servant, or\r\ntenant of the said James Mechlin; deny that the said James Mechlin ever\r\nwas in the possession of the said premises, but on the contrary, these\r\ndefendants allege that if James Mechlin had any kind of possession, it\r\nwas as a naked trespasser, and his title to said property was at all\r\ntimes disputed and contested by other parties.\r\n\r\nThese defendants allege that defendant Charles Hogsden was the rightful\r\nowner of the said premises; that defendants Peter Roper and John Gasbang\r\nare the innocent purchasers of the legal and equitable title, and are\r\nnow in actual and lawful possession of the said premises, having paid a\r\njust and fair price to the rightful owner, Charles Hogsden.\r\n\r\nThese defendants further allege, that the plaintiff Beatrice Mechlin\r\nwrongfully, unlawfully, fraudulently and maliciously, and for the\r\npurpose of cheating and defrauding the aforesaid innocent purchasers,\r\nPeter Roper and John Gasbang, out of their rights in said property,\r\nentered into a fraudulent conspiracy with one Josefa Alamar and one\r\nGabriel Alamar, wherein it was agreed by and between them that said\r\nJosefa Alamar, as executrix of the estate of Mariano Alamar, and\r\npurporting to carry out the wishes and instructions of her deceased\r\nhusband, the said Mariano Alamar, would execute a deed of sale or a\r\nconfirmatory deed of said property.\r\n\r\nAnd these defendants aver, that in pursuance of the fraudulent\r\nconspiracy aforesaid, the said Josefa did execute a fraudulent deed of\r\nsale to the said Beatrice Mechlin, for the purpose of cheating and\r\ndefrauding these innocent purchasers, etc.\r\n\r\nThis string of prevarications ran on for about twenty pages more,\r\nrepeating, _ad nauseam_, the same falsehoods with all legal alliteration\r\nand more than legal license.\r\n\r\nGabriel was left to attend this suit and other matters, and with grief,\r\nwhich was too profound for description and too heart-rending almost for\r\nhuman endurance, the two loving families separated.\r\n\r\nElvira must leave her beloved mother in her sad bereavement; Lizzie must\r\nsee hers go to perform the painful duty of accompanying the remains of a\r\nbeloved husband.\r\n\r\nIn sorrow and silent tears the Alamar family returned to their country\r\nhouse the day after the Mechlins left.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s suit in ejectment against the \xe2\x80\x9c_innocent_ purchasers,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nPeter and John, was, as a matter of course, decided in favor of these\r\n_innocents_ of Judge Gryllus Lawlack. The Judge knew, as well as any one\r\nelse, that the allegations of these men were brazen falsehoods strung\r\ntogether for the purpose of robbery. Nevertheless, his Honor Lawlack\r\nmade his rulings, and set down his findings, all to suit the robbers.\r\nAmong the findings that his Honor had the hardihood to write down, were\r\nthese: That \xe2\x80\x9cJames Mechlin had never possessed the premises in question;\r\nhad never lived there in person or by proxy, and had never made any\r\nimprovements, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d And these premeditated falsehoods went to the\r\nSupreme Court. The case was, of course, reversed and remanded for new\r\ntrial, but with additional misstatements it was _again_ decided by Judge\r\nLawlack in favor of his friends. Thus, in fact, the Supreme Court was\r\n_reversed by Judge Gryllus Lawlack_. The case was the second time\r\nremanded by the Supreme Court, but in a new trial it was _again_ decided\r\nin favor of Peter and John. This being the same as \xe2\x80\x9creversing the\r\nSupreme Court,\xe2\x80\x9d but Lawlack laughs at this, saying that the Supreme\r\nCourt decides according to their opinions, and he (Lawlack) does the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nAs for Peter Roper, he made no concealment of there being a _private\r\nbargain_ between himself and Judge Gryllus Lawlack. Peter to render\r\npolitical or other services, Gryllus to reward them with judicial ones.\r\n\r\nAt a political meeting a friend of Roper (a lawyer in the pay of the\r\nmonopoly), urged him to make a speech in favor of the railroad. Peter\r\ndeclined, saying that as Gryllus Lawlack wanted to run again for the\r\nJudgeship, and knew how anti-monopolist San Diego County was, it would\r\nhurt the Judge politically to have him (Peter Roper) speak for the\r\nmonopoly, as everybody knew that he (Peter) was the principal support of\r\nthe Judge, and exponent of his principles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Peter, \xe2\x80\x9cif I speak for the monopoly the Judge will\r\ngrant a rehearing in a suit I am opposing, and will not decide my case\r\nas I want. That is understood between us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis is the fashion of dispensing justice in San Diego, just as Peter\r\nbargains for.\r\n\r\nBut this order of things (or rather disorder) could not have been\r\npossible if the Texas Pacific Railroad had not been strangled, as San\r\nDiego would not then be the poor, crippled and dwarfed little city that\r\nshe now is. In this unfortunate condition it is that she submits to the\r\nscandalous debaucheries of judicial favorites; debaucheries and\r\nviolations of common justice, social decorum, of individual rights;\r\ndebaucheries tolerated because the local power sanctions with his\r\nencouragement such proceedings.\r\n\r\nIf San Diego had been permitted to grow, to have a population, her\r\nadministration of the laws would have been in other hands, and outrages\r\nlike breaking into the Mechlin house could not have occurred. The voters\r\nof the county would not then have elected a Judge that could reward such\r\nvandalism, by allowing the thieves to keep the stolen premises. Now,\r\nhowever, without a railroad, San Diego is at the bottom of a bag, the\r\nmouth of which Mr. Huntington has closed and drawn the strings tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\xe2\x80\x94_Clarence and George with the Hod-carrier._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lawsuits forced upon the Mechlins, to resist the fraudulent claims\r\ntrumped up by Roper and Gasbang, obliged Gabriel to delay returning to\r\nhis place at the San Francisco bank. It was very painful to leave his\r\nmother and Mercedes still so sick and depressed, but they themselves\r\nurged him to go, fearing that his place would be given to another, and\r\nnow, when their pecuniary circumstances were so embarrassed, he could\r\nill afford to lose his position. But he did, for as the bank could not\r\nwait for him longer, they took some one else instead. He wished to spare\r\nhis family the regret of knowing this, and tried to get anything to do\r\nto earn a living. Thus he began that agony endured by so many young men\r\nof good families and education, trying to find employment to support\r\nthemselves decently. Gabriel found the task most difficult. He was\r\ndignified and diffident, and could not be too pressing. He was\r\npersevering and patient and willing to work, but he dreaded to seem\r\nimportunate, and never urged his services upon any one. But he tried\r\neverything, every means he could think of or Lizzie suggest to him. At\r\ntimes he would find some writing to do, either copying or translating\r\nEnglish or Spanish, but this did not give him permanent employment, and\r\nbetween one job and another Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s jewelry had to be sold for their\r\ndaily expenses. They gave up the nice little cottage they had had\r\nbefore, and took two small rooms at the house of a widow lady who kept a\r\nfew boarders. Their living was simple, indeed; but their landlady was\r\nkind and courteous and obliging, and her house clean and very\r\nrespectable. Thus many months went by.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Elvira and Caroline wrote to them, constantly telling them\r\nhow and where they were. Now they were in Germany, as Mr. Mechlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nphysician advised George to try some German baths in which he had great\r\nfaith. His faith was justified in George\xe2\x80\x99s case, for he began to improve\r\nrapidly before he had been taking the baths a month, and he was\r\nconfident of regaining his health perfectly. This was cheerful news, and\r\nLizzie felt great reluctance in writing to George how unsuccessful\r\nGabriel had been, thus perhaps checking his recovery by making him again\r\ndespondent; for it was a noted fact, well recognized by the two\r\nfamilies, that misfortunes made them all more or less physically ill.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1876 now set in, and Gabriel thought he must make up his\r\nmind to find some manual labor, and by that means perhaps get permanent\r\noccupation; but here other obstacles, no less insuperable, confronted\r\nhim. He had had no training to fit him to be a mechanic, and what could\r\nhe do? He did not know, and yet his family must be supported. He had not\r\nbeen able to send to his mother any money, as his scant earnings were\r\ninadequate to support his wife and babies. There was now another little\r\ngirl to provide for\xe2\x80\x94a little darling, eight months old. Poor people are\r\nbound to have children.\r\n\r\nAbout this time he got a letter from Victoriano, telling him how his\r\nmiserable legs had failed him again, giving out in the midst of his\r\nplowing. Everett had come to help him plow up a fifty-acre piece of land\r\nhe had intended to put in wheat, but lo! before he had plowed two acres,\r\nhis legs seemed to disappear from under him as if the very Old Nick had\r\nunscrewed his knees and carried them off. Tano added: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here I am, a\r\nperfect gentleman from my knees up, but a mean chicken, a ridiculous\r\nturkey, a kangaroo, from my knees down; and this, too, when we can so\r\nill afford to have me lying in a sick-bed, perfectly useless. If land\r\nwas not so valueless now, we might perhaps be able to sell some,\r\nalthough the price would have to be very low, on account of the delay in\r\ngetting our patent and its being mortgaged; but as all hopes in the\r\nTexas Pacific are dead, land sales are dead, too, and we might as well\r\nall be dead, for as we have nothing but land to get a living from, and\r\nthat is dead, you can draw the inference. However, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about us;\r\nfor the present, we are getting along very well. Several of the cattle\r\nlost in the mountains have come and keep coming, and Everett puts our\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_venta_\xe2\x80\x99 brand on, and pays mamma, on Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s account, cash down for\r\nthem. To-day he paid mamma three hundred dollars, and he says he heard\r\nthat more cattle are on the way here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGabriel was very glad that his mother and sisters would have this little\r\npittance at least, but he was much alarmed and anxious about Victoriano,\r\nand hastened to tell Lizzie he thought they ought to go home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am truly sorry for poor Tano. Really, my sweet husband, you must let\r\nme write to George, telling him our circumstances. He can and will help\r\nus, and we might go back to the rancho.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t write to him about that yet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get money enough to\r\ntake us home. If Tano is sick, I certainly should be there. If he was\r\ntrying to plow, I think I can do that, too. Yes, I ought to have stayed\r\nat home and worked in our orchard, and we would not have suffered the\r\ndistress of mind at my repeated failures. As soon as I make money enough\r\nto pay the board bill I owe and have enough left to pay our fare to San\r\nDiego, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home. Don\xe2\x80\x99t write to George to help me, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nthat. I can work and help myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lizzie, blushing crimson; \xe2\x80\x9cI have already\r\nwritten to George. I told him I was going to persuade you to go home. I\r\nwrote him a month ago. I expect his answer very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d Seeing that\r\nGabriel also blushed, Lizzie added: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry if I offended you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not offended me. I blushed because I, too, have been keeping a\r\nsecret from you, thinking you might not approve of it, or feel\r\nhumiliated.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been trying to learn a trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA trade! What trade, for gracious sake?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very respectable one. That of a mason.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can you learn that? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnywhere. I have been taking some lessons and earning my two dollars\r\nper day besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Gabriel, why did you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d said Lizzie, her face suffused with\r\nblushes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere! See how you blush because I want to learn an honest trade, and\r\nyet see how your people, the Americans, deride us, the Spanish, for\r\nbeing indolent, unwilling to work. For my part, I am willing to prove\r\nthat I will work at anything that is not absolutely repulsive, to earn a\r\nliving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you come to select that trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause to go down town I had to pass by the houses of the railroad\r\nmillionaires which have been in process of construction. There are two\r\nCalifornians from Santa Barbara, whom I know, working there, and to see\r\nthem earning their two dollars per day, while I have been losing months\r\nin search of more gentlemanly work to do, suggested to me the idea of\r\nalso earning my two dollars a day while the gentlemanly occupation is\r\nbeing found. Then I thought, too, that I might learn to be an architect,\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why you have been reading those books on architecture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I think I understand a good deal about it already, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncombine practice with theory. The thing now is, as Tano is sick, I must\r\ngo home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let us go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of your being a mason. Give it\r\nup. I think I\xe2\x80\x99d rather see you plowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; in my own land, you mean. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be proud. Let me work a little\r\nwhile longer at _my trade_, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Lizzie was not willing he should, though she said nothing more about\r\nit to him. She wrote to Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa, saying that if she could spare\r\nfifty dollars, to, please, send that sum to her to enable them to come\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThere would be ten days, however, before she could get Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreply. This was not so agreeable, but Lizzie thought she would get ready\r\nto start as soon as the money came.\r\n\r\nThe cause of Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s second severe attack of lameness, of which he\r\nspoke in his letter, was again exposure\xe2\x80\x94exposure to cold and dampness.\r\nAbout the same time that Gabriel was trying to be a mason, and working\r\nas a common day laborer at two dollars per day, Victoriano had been\r\npruning trees, fixing fences, repairing irrigating ditches and plowing.\r\nHe had only two men to help him, so he worked very hard, in fact,\r\nentirely too hard for one so unused to labor. Work broke him down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlowing is too hard work for poor Tano,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said, looking at\r\nVictoriano working in a field near the house, while the sad tears ran\r\ndown her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, mamma, it is; and I begged him not to try to plow again, but he\r\ninsisted on doing so,\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter? Did he fall down?\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa exclaimed, alarmed,\r\ndrawing her chair close to the window.\r\n\r\nMercedes arose from hers, and came to look down the orchard. Yes, there\r\nwas Victoriano sitting on the ground, and Everett standing by him.\r\nPresently Everett sat down beside him, and an Indian boy, who had also\r\nbeen plowing with another team, came up, leading his horses towards the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa thought that they wanted to put the boy at some other work,\r\nand that Tano was resting, so she sat quietly waiting to see whether he\r\nwould walk.\r\n\r\nMercedes now sat by her mother, also to watch Victoriano. She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma, tell Tano not to try plowing, the ground is very damp. He will\r\nhave that lameness again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have told him, but he says he must work now, since we are so poor,\r\nand have only land with a title that no one believes in, and no one will\r\nbuy. So what is he to do but work? And he has been working very hard all\r\nthe fall and winter, but I fear he is getting that lameness again. He\r\nwalks lame already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey now saw that the Indian boy had run to the house to hitch his\r\nhorses to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s ph\xc3\xa6ton and drive to where Tano was sitting.\r\nAssisted by the Indian, Everett put Victoriano in the ph\xc3\xa6ton, and\r\nbrought him to the house.\r\n\r\nIt was as his mother and sister had feared\xe2\x80\x94Victoriano was again unable\r\nto walk. With great difficulty, assisted by Everett and the servant boy,\r\nhe reached his bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t write to George or Gabriel that I am sick. Wait until I get\r\nbetter, or worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nSeeing, however, that there was no change in his condition, he wrote to\r\nGabriel himself, telling him of his second attack. Willingly would\r\nGabriel have taken his little family and started for home, but he did\r\nnot have money enough to pay their fare, and he owed for their last\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x99s board. So there was nothing to do but to wait and work as a day\r\nlaborer yet for a while. He knew what he earned in a whole month would\r\nscarcely be enough to pay their board, and that to go home he must write\r\nhis mother to send him money for their fare. But his pride revolted. He\r\nhated to do this. He could not bring his mind to it. He hesitated.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Victoriano was taken sick and Gabriel was trying to\r\nbe a mason, George and family arrived in Paris on their return from\r\nGermany. They would only spend a week or ten days in that city, and then\r\nsail for New York.\r\n\r\nThe day before they were to start, a card was sent to Elvira from the\r\noffice of the hotel. Elvira took it very indifferently and read the\r\nname, but the words she read seemed to be cabalistic, for she started,\r\nturned red and then pale.\r\n\r\nShe handed the card to George, who read aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cClarence Darrell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk the gentleman to please come up,\xe2\x80\x9d said George to the servant, and\r\nfollowed him, going to meet Clarence.\r\n\r\nThe two friends met and clasped each other in a tight embrace; to shake\r\nhands seemed to both too cold a way of greeting, when they felt so much\r\npain and joy that to express their sentiments, words were inadequate.\r\n\r\nWhen Clarence came in, he stretched both hands to Elvira, and she, on\r\nthe impulse of the moment, threw her arms around his neck and sobbed.\r\nMrs. Mechlin and Caroline were also affected to tears. Clarence brought\r\nback to them vividly the happy days at Alamar, when Mr. Mechlin and Don\r\nMariano lived so contentedly in each other\xe2\x80\x99s society.\r\n\r\nAll were so anxious to learn how Clarence came to be in Paris, and where\r\nhe had been in all these years, and Elvira showered so many questions\r\nupon him, that George told him he must remain with them and tell them\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nThe family of Mr. Lawrence Mechlin were also in the same hotel, on their\r\nway to New York.\r\n\r\nGeorge said to Clarence: \xe2\x80\x9cPrepare yourself to be cross-questioned by\r\naunt, for she has been very anxious about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence replied he was willing to be questioned, and began his\r\nnarrative by saying how he came to miss all the letters written to him.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was delirious and at the point of death in a cabin at the mines,\r\nall the letters that came addressed to me the doctor put in a paper bag,\r\nand when he left he considered me still too weak to read letters that\r\nmight cause me excitement, so he took the paper bag and placed it behind\r\na camp looking-glass which hung over a little table beside my bed. I was\r\nso impressed with the conviction that I might not be considered fit to\r\nmarry Miss Mercedes, that when, upon asking if any letters had come for\r\nme, and Fred Haverly, thinking that I meant other letters besides those\r\nhanded to the doctor, answered in the negative. I did not explain that I\r\nhad not received any at all. I accepted patiently what I considered a\r\nnatural result of my father\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and said nothing. I went to\r\nMexico, and there a fatality followed my letters again. I missed them\r\ntwice\xe2\x80\x94once through the mistake of a clerk at my bankers, the second time\r\nby a mistake of the Secretary of the Legation, who misunderstood\r\nHubert\xe2\x80\x99s request about returning the letters to him. From Mexico I went\r\nto South America, crossed to Brazil, and went to England. From England I\r\nwent to the Mediterranean, and since then I have been on the go, like\r\nthe restless spirit that I was, believing myself a miserable outcast. It\r\nwas almost accidentally that I came to Paris. I got a letter from\r\nHubert, and in a postscript he said that he hoped I got my letters at\r\nlast, for he had sent them with a remittance to my bankers, requesting\r\nthat my letters should be kept until I called for them. I was far up the\r\nNile when I received his letter, but next morning I started for Paris\r\nwith a beating heart, I can assure you. Twenty-six letters I found, and\r\nI am more grieved than I can express to you to think that I did not get\r\nthem before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarence arose and paced the floor in great agitation, and his friends\r\nwere much moved also, for they knew he was thinking that never again, in\r\nthis world, would he see his noble friend, Don Mariano.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the Mechlins, accompanied by Clarence left\r\nParis. Before leaving, Clarence telegraphed to Mercedes:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cI have just received your letters written in \xe2\x80\x9973. I leave for\r\n    New York to-morrow with the Mechlins, thence for California.\r\n\r\n                                           \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94 _Clarence Darrell._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverett, who had been to town, religiously, to see whether there might\r\nbe a letter from Clarence, or news about him, brought Mercedes the\r\ncablegram.\r\n\r\nPoor Mercedes, she read the few words many times over before she could\r\nrealize that they were from Clarence. When she did so, she was seized\r\nwith a violent trembling, and then completely overcome by emotion. Ah!\r\nyes she would see him again, but where was now her darling papa, who was\r\nso fond of Clarence?\r\n\r\nMercedes sent the dispatch for Mrs. Darrell to see, and when Everett\r\nbrought it back, Carlota made a copy of it to send to Lizzie in a letter\r\nnext day. The Darrells were truly overjoyed, thrown into a perfect storm\r\nof pleasure. The old man said not a word. He went to his lonely room,\r\nlocked the door, and there, as usual since he lived the life of a\r\nhalf-divorced man, battled with his spirit. This time, however, he\r\nallowed tears to flow as he blessed his absent boy, and thanked God that\r\nhe was coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had a decent pair of legs to speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tano to Everett, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould dance for sheer joy, but having no legs, I can only use my tongue\r\nand repeat how glad I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Gabriel came home in the evening of the day in which Lizzie\r\nreceived the copy of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s telegram, she said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarling, don\xe2\x80\x99t go to that horrid work again. Clarence is coming, and\r\nnow he and George will establish the bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but in the meantime I must earn enough to pay our board; remember,\r\nwe owe one month\xe2\x80\x99s board already. Be patient for a few days longer.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nshe was patient, but anxious. A few days more passed, and she received\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa\xe2\x80\x99s letter, inclosing seventy dollars, and saying she hoped\r\nthey would come immediately, for she wanted Gabriel at home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we have money enough to pay our board bill, and as George will\r\nsurely come to our assistance, why should you go to work as a mason?\r\nDarling, leave that work,\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzie begged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us see; Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s cablegram was dated twenty days ago. They must\r\nhave arrived in New York a week ago, and if he don\xe2\x80\x99t delay at all, he\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe here in two or three days,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabriel said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why should you work like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll stop to-morrow, but I must give notice of a day or two, at least,\r\nfor the foreman to get somebody else in my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Gabriel arrived at his place of employment near Nob Hill, he found\r\nthat his occupation that day would be different from what it had been\r\nbefore, and in the afternoon he was put to work at another place in the\r\nbuilding. He would have to carry bricks and mortar up a ladder to quite\r\na high wall. He told the foreman that he would rather not do that, as he\r\nhad never done such work and was very awkward about it. The foreman said\r\nhe had no one else to spare for that job, and Gabriel at last said he\r\nwould try. He had carried many loads, and was beginning to tremble with\r\nfatigue, when upon going up, carrying a hod full of bricks, the ladder\r\nslipped to one side a little. In his effort to steady it, Gabriel moved\r\nit too much, and it fell to one side, taking him to the ground. As he\r\nfell, the bricks fell upon him. He was insensible for some time. When he\r\nregained consciousness he was being carried to a wagon which would take\r\nhim to the city hospital. Lizzie, to whom the foreman had sent a message\r\nnotifying her of the accident, now met the wagon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you taking my husband?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked the driver.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the city hospital, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not take him home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he will get attendance there quickly, Madam,\xe2\x80\x9d said the foreman,\r\nwho evidently felt he was to blame for a very painful accident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is the case, let us go to the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzie said, getting\r\ninto the wagon. She sat beside Gabriel, and placed his head in her lap.\r\nGabriel smiled, and his beautiful eyes were full of love, but he could\r\nscarcely speak a word.\r\n\r\nThe jolting of the wagon gave him much pain, and Lizzie asked the driver\r\nto go very slow. \xe2\x80\x9cHe ought to be carried on a stretcher, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; he is\r\ntoo much hurt to go in a wagon,\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver.\r\n\r\nThey now came to a street-crossing, and several wagons were standing\r\nstill, waiting for a line of carriages to pass first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, why do we wait? He is suffering so much!\xe2\x80\x9d Lizzie exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is\r\nbleeding; he might bleed to death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are waiting for them carriages to pass, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. They are carrying\r\npeople to a reception on Nob Hill, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the street, in a carriage which also had been\r\nstopped that the guests for the Nob Hill festivities might pass, sat\r\nGeorge and Clarence, just arrived, and on their way to see Lizzie and\r\nGabriel. They saw that a man lay in a wagon which stood in front of\r\nthem, and noticing that a woman sat by his side holding his head in her\r\nlap, bending over him anxiously, Clarence said to the driver that there\r\nseemed to be some one sick in that wagon, and that it should be allowed\r\nto pass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir; but he is a hod-carrier who fell down and hurt himself. I\r\nsuppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll die before he gets to the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d said the driver,\r\nindifferently, as if a hod-carrier more or less was of no consequence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe carriages must pass first, the police says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs Lizzie raised her head to ask the driver to take some other street,\r\nthey saw her. Both uttered an exclamation of surprise, and left their\r\ncarriages immediately, walking hurriedly to the wagon where she was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLizzie, my sister, why are you here?\xe2\x80\x9d George asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, George! Gabriel fell down!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, sobbing, her courage\r\nfailing now that she had some dear ones to protect her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Clarence,\r\nsee how you find my darling! We are taking him to the city hospital, but\r\nbecause those carriages must pass first my darling may die here\xe2\x80\x94bleeding\r\nto death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me go for a physician immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the nearest from here, Lizzie, your house\r\nor the hospital? We must take him to the nearest place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hospital is nearer, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d the driver answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let us go the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d George said, getting into the wagon\r\nbeside his sister, shocked to find Gabriel in a situation which plainly\r\nrevealed a poverty he had never imagined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall go for a surgeon, there might not be one at the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nClarence. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall be there when you arrive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe wagon went so slowly that Clarence, with a doctor, overtook them\r\nbefore they reached the hospital. Meantime, Gabriel had whispered to\r\nLizzie and George, in a few words, how he had fallen down.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the hospital he was carried to the best room, with best\r\nattendance, two rooms adjoining were for his nurses, one to be occupied\r\nby Lizzie and the other by George and Clarence, for neither of them\r\nwould leave Gabriel now.\r\n\r\nThe doctor would give no opinion as to his recovery. If he had internal\r\ninjuries of a serious character, they might prove fatal, but of this it\r\nwas impossible to judge at present. About eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock Gabriel seemed\r\nto be resting a little more comfortably, and Lizzie took that\r\nopportunity to go to see her babies. She found them already asleep. The\r\nkind landlady had given them their supper and put them to bed. She told\r\nLizzie of a good nurse who could be hired to take care of the baby, and\r\nthat she would engage her to come the next morning. Lizzie thanked her,\r\nand then returned to her husband\xe2\x80\x99s bedside, and there, accompanied by\r\nGeorge and Clarence, she passed the night.\r\n\r\nAbout daylight, with great reluctance, she was prevailed upon to lie\r\ndown on a lounge at the foot of Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and as the patient seemed\r\nto be resting quietly, George and Clarence went into the next room to\r\npartake of a light collation.\r\n\r\nGeorge poured a glass of wine for Clarence and another for himself, and\r\nboth drank in silence. Evidently they could not eat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it possible to imagine that Gabriel could have become so poor that\r\nhe had to be a hod-carrier?\xe2\x80\x9d George said at last, scarcely above a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nClarence being as much moved, took some time to reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is to me so shockingly preposterous and so very heart-rending\r\nthat it does not seem possible. And to think that if I had not gone\r\naway, I might, yes, could, have prevented so much suffering! Oh! the\r\nfool, the idiot that I was to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarence, rising and pacing the\r\nroom in great agitation. \xe2\x80\x9cI will never forgive myself nor my bankers\r\neither, and shall take my money to some other bank. They should never\r\nhave given Don Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s place to anybody else, for it was at my\r\nrequest, and to oblige me that they employed him, and they have had the\r\nuse of my money all this time. Oh! how I wish you could have established\r\na bank here with the three hundred thousand dollars I placed to Don\r\nMariano\xe2\x80\x99s credit, since he would not accept any payment for the\r\ncattle\xe2\x80\x94_my_ cattle, mind you\xe2\x80\x94lost in the snow. But perhaps three hundred\r\nthousand dollars would have been rather small capital.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been plenty to begin with, but as the understanding was\r\nthat the bank was to be in San Diego, none of us felt authorized to\r\nchange the plan. I doubt if Don Mariano would have drawn any of the\r\nthree hundred thousand dollars. You know he mortgaged his rancho rather\r\nthan take any of your money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis money, you ought to say, for I had already bought his cattle. I\r\nwish he had not taken so different a view of the matter. Really, the\r\nmoney was his from the moment I agreed to make the purchase. But tell\r\nme, why is it that Mrs. Mechlin lost her homestead. It might have been\r\nsold to help the family.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge related how Peter Roper \xe2\x80\x9c_jumped_\xe2\x80\x9d the Mechlin house in true\r\nvandalic style, breaking open the doors with axes and dragging out the\r\nfurniture when the family were in great grief, and how this outrage as\r\nwell as others were indulgently passed over by San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s august\r\ntribunal of justice. George, however, did not know all. He did not know\r\nthat Judge Lawlack upon one occasion, when he had made a decision in\r\nfavor of Peter Roper and against the Mechlins, discovering upon\r\nreflection that he had made a gross mistake, because the authority upon\r\nwhich he based his decision, obviously favored the Mechlins, had changed\r\nhis decision. He actually called the attorneys of both sides into court\r\nand then amended his own decree and had an entirely different judgment\r\nentered\xe2\x80\x94a judgment based upon another authority, which, with his\r\nconstruction of the law, favored Peter. Then again when the Mechlins\r\ntried to file another complaint, Peter got up, and in his coarse\r\nloquacity, vociferously exhorted his Honor to send all the plaintiffs\r\nand their attorney to jail for _contempt of court_ in daring to renew\r\ntheir complaint when his Honor had decided that they had no case; that\r\nthe _innocent purchasers_, Roper and Gasbang, were the legitimate owners\r\nof the Mechlin place. Whereupon, his Honor Lawlack hurriedly slid off\r\nthe judicial bench, under the judicial canopy, in high tantrums, and\r\nshuffled off the judicial platform, gruffly mumbling: \xe2\x80\x9cI have passed\r\nupon that before,\xe2\x80\x9d and slouchingly made his exit.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs, their attorneys and their witnesses, were left to make\r\nthe best of _such legal proceedings_! They could not even take an appeal\r\nto the Supreme Court, for they had no record; they could make no\r\npleadings; Judge Lawlack had carefully and effectively done all he could\r\nto ruin their case. Peter winked and showed his yellow teeth and purple\r\ngums in high glee, proud to have exhibited his influence with the Court,\r\nand, as usual, went to celebrate his triumph by getting intoxicated and\r\nbeing whipped, so that he had a black eye and skinned nose for several\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to George and Clarence that the position of Gabriel and\r\nLizzie in San Francisco must have been painful in the extreme, and yet\r\nthey did not know all. Lizzie had never told anybody all the\r\ndisagreeable, humiliating, repugnant experiences she had had to pass\r\nthrough. She had tried to help her husband to find some occupation more\r\nbefitting a gentleman than that of a day laborer. But she gave up her\r\nsad endeavors, seeing that she was only humiliating herself to no\r\npurpose. She met at times gentlemen and kind-hearted men, who were\r\ncourteous to her, but oftener she found occasion to despise mankind for\r\ntheir unnecessary rudeness and most unprovoked boorishness. More painful\r\nyet was the evident change she noticed in the manners of her lady\r\nacquaintances.\r\n\r\nYears before, when she was Lizzie Mechlin, she had moved in what was\r\ncalled San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s _best_ society. Her family, being of the very\r\nhighest in New York, were courted and caressed in exaggerated degree on\r\ntheir arrival in California. Afterwards, for the benefit of Mr.\r\nMechlin\xe2\x80\x99s health, they went to reside in San Diego. When Gabriel came to\r\nhis position in the bank, she was again warmly received by all her\r\nsociety friends. But this cordiality soon vanished. Her family went back\r\nto New York, and she and Gabriel returned from San Diego to San\r\nFrancisco to find that he had lost his place at the bank. Then he\r\nendeavored to get something else to do. This was bad enough, but when\r\n_she_ tried to help him, then her fashionable friends disappeared. Nay,\r\nthey avoided her as if she had been guilty of some disgraceful act. The\r\nfact that Gabriel was a _native Spaniard_, she saw plainly, militated\r\nagainst them. If he had been rich, his nationality could have been\r\nforgiven, but no one will willingly tolerate a _poor native\r\nCalifornian_. To see all this was at first painful to Lizzie, but\r\nafterwards it began to be amusing and laughable to see people show their\r\nmean little souls and their want of brains in their eager chase after\r\nthe rich, and their discourtesy to an old acquaintance who certainly had\r\ndone nothing to forfeit respect. About that time the fever for stock\r\ngambling was at its height. The _Big Bonanza_ was, in the twinkling of\r\nan eye, making and unmaking money princes, and a new set of rich people\r\nhad rushed into \xe2\x80\x9cSan Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s best society.\xe2\x80\x9d The leaders of the _ton_\r\nthen, who held title by priority of possession, not forgetting that many\r\nof them had had to serve a rigorous novitiate of years of probation\r\nbefore they had been admitted to the high circles, were disposed to be\r\nexclusive and keep off social \xe2\x80\x9c_jumpers_.\xe2\x80\x9d But the weight of gold\r\ncarried the day. Down came the jealously guarded gates; the very portals\r\nsuccumbed and crumbled under that heavy pressure. Farewell,\r\nexclusiveness! Henceforth, money shall be the sole requisite upon which\r\nto base social claims. High culture, talents, good antecedents,\r\naccomplishments, all were now the veriest trash. Money, and nothing but\r\nmoney, became the order of the day. Many of the newly created\r\nmoney-nobility lived but a day in their new, their sporadic, evanescent\r\nglory, and then, with a tumble of the stocks, went down head-foremost,\r\nto rise no more. But some of the luckiest survived, and are yet shining\r\nstars. Lizzie saw all this from her humble seclusion. Occasionally, at\r\nthe houses of those few friends who had remained unchanged in her day of\r\nadversity, she met some of the newly arrived in society as well as a few\r\nof the fading lights, taking a secondary place. All the new and the old\r\nlights she saw, with equal impartiality, shifting their places\r\ncontinually, and she began to think that, after all, this transposing of\r\npositions perhaps was right, being the unavoidable outcome in a new\r\ncountry, where naturally the raw material is so abundant, and the chase\r\nafter social position must be a sort of \xe2\x80\x9c_go-as-you-please_\xe2\x80\x9d race among\r\nthe golden-legged.\r\n\r\nTherefore, like the true lady that she was, Lizzie had quietly accepted\r\nher fate, and forgiven fickle society, without a murmur of complaint or\r\na pang of regret. But what certainly was a perennial anguish, a\r\ncrucifixion of spirit to her, was to see in Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s pale face,\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nthose superb eyes of his,\xe2\x80\x94all his mental suffering; then courage failed\r\nher, and on her bended knees she would implore a merciful heaven to pity\r\nand help her beloved, her beautiful archangel.\r\n\r\nWhat Gabriel suffered in spirit probably no one will ever know, for\r\nthough he inherited the natural nobility of his father, he was not like\r\nhim communicative, ready to offer or receive sympathy. He was sensitive,\r\nkind, courteous and unselfish, but very reticent.\r\n\r\nBut if Gabriel had never complained, the eloquence of facts had said all\r\nthat was to be said. In that hod full of bricks not only his own sad\r\nexperience was represented, but _the entire history_ of the native\r\nCalifornians of _Spanish descent_ was epitomized. Yes, Gabriel carrying\r\nhis hod full of bricks up a steep ladder, was a symbolical\r\nrepresentation of his race. The natives, of Spanish origin, having lost\r\nall their property, must henceforth be hod-carriers.\r\n\r\nUnjust laws despoiled them, but what of this? Poor they are, but who is\r\nto care, or investigate the cause of their poverty? The thriving\r\nAmerican says that the native Spaniards are lazy and stupid and\r\nthriftless, and as the prosperous know it all, and are almost\r\ninfallible, the fiat has gone forth, and the Spaniards of California are\r\nnot only despoiled of all their earthly possessions, but must also be\r\nbereft of sympathy, because the world says they do not deserve it.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Clarence entertained a different opinion, however, and in\r\nsuppressed, earnest tones they now reviewed the history of the Alamares,\r\nand feelingly deplored the cruel legislation that had ruined them.\r\n\r\nLizzie, unable to sleep, had again taken her place by the bedside, and\r\nsadly watched the beautiful face which seemed like that of slumbering\r\nApollo. Would he recover, or was it possible that her darling would die,\r\nnow when relief had come? Oh, the cruel fate that made him descend to\r\nthat humble occupation.\r\n\r\nLizzie shuddered to think of all the suffering he would yet have to\r\nundergo. Oh, it was so inexpressibly sad to think that his precious life\r\nwas risked for the pitiful wages of a poor hod-carrier!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\xe2\x80\x94_Reunited at Last._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of Gabriel hung by a very frail thread for several days, and\r\nClarence did not have the heart to leave him. He did not telegraph to\r\nMercedes their arrival, for he would then have been obliged to give a\r\nreason for delaying. He wrote her saying that Gabriel had accidentally\r\nfallen from a ladder, and not knowing how seriously he might have been\r\nhurt, George and himself had decided to remain with Lizzie, who was very\r\nmuch frightened and distressed.\r\n\r\nMercedes answered, thanking him in the warmest terms of gratitude for\r\nremaining with her darling brother, adding that much as she wished to\r\nsee the long-lost Clarence, she preferred to endure the pains of waiting\r\nrather than to have him leave Gabriel now.\r\n\r\nThe proudest man in America was Clarence. He knew that in the gratitude\r\nof her heart she would allow him to press her to his, and he longed to\r\nhave that bliss. But faithfully he kept his watch at the hospital, and\r\nGabriel lived yet. No doctor dared say whether he would die or survive\r\nhis terrible fall, or his health remain impaired. No one dare venture a\r\nprophecy for so dark a future.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Clarence got his house ready for occupation, and as soon\r\nas Gabriel could be removed without danger, they took up their residence\r\nthere. In the silent recesses of her heart Lizzie thanked God that her\r\nsurroundings were again those of a lady. She shuddered to remember the\r\npoverty she endured for so long a time, and she would have felt really\r\nhappy could she have been sure that her beloved Gabriel would live.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge,\xe2\x80\x9d said she to her brother, as they walked towards the library,\r\nwhen Clarence had relieved their watch, and was sitting by Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbedside, \xe2\x80\x9cI have an idea in my head which I think we might put into\r\npractice, if you will help me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, dear sister?\xe2\x80\x9d asked George, tenderly, observing how thin\r\nand haggard she looked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is this, that if you and I write to Mercedes that she ought to marry\r\nright away, so that Clarence can bring her to be with me, to help me\r\ntake care of Gabriel, that she will do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy, Jove! It is a splendid idea, little sister, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to\r\nMercita and to Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is little enough, George, for you and I to do, when Clarence has\r\nbeen so devoted to my darling,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, her eyes filling with tears of\r\nheart-felt gratitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is, but it comes so natural to Clarence to act always like\r\nthe noble fellow he is, that it would surprise me if he had acted\r\notherwise than nobly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we ought to consult him about our project.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and stay with Gabriel and send him to you that you\r\nmay disclose your plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, let me go to Gabriel, while you tell him the plan,\xe2\x80\x9d said she,\r\nhurrying off to the invalid, whom she found sleeping.\r\n\r\nShe whispered to Clarence that George wished to speak to him, and took\r\nhis place by the bedside.\r\n\r\nClarence could find no words to express to George his joy and gratitude.\r\nHe flushed and paled by turns, and finally, stroking his mustache with\r\ntrembling fingers, and trying to bite it, in his agitation, sat down in\r\nsilence, while George went into the details of the matter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut will she consent?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence exclaimed at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she will, for you know how all of them love Gabriel, Mercedes\r\nmore than all,\xe2\x80\x94and the thought that he is suffering, and Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndistress, and your kindness to him,\xe2\x80\x94all that will furnish a most\r\nexcellent excuse to do what her heart has been begging for,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nGeorge. \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to write now about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I shall be so grateful!\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSend Lizzie to me, we both must write,\xe2\x80\x9d George said.\r\n\r\nClarence went back to the sick room, and said to Lizzie that George\r\nwanted her.\r\n\r\nKissing her hand most fervently, he exclaimed in a tremulous whisper:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my angel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGeorge and Lizzie\xe2\x80\x99s letters were very pleading. Clarence wrote also,\r\nimploring Mercedes to forgive the stupidity that took him away, and\r\nbeseeched her to yield to his prayer, and be his wife, after so many\r\nyears of suffering.\r\n\r\nMercedes kissed the letter, and cried over it, of course, as women must,\r\nbut referred the subject to her mother. Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa must also cry a good\r\ndeal before she said anything, for the memory of her husband made such\r\nsubjects most painful to her.\r\n\r\nBut Victoriano stormed from his bed. He would have no delay. He sent for\r\nEverett, so that he would in person carry a dispatch to town, saying to\r\nClarence, by telegraph, to come in the very first steamer. Victoriano\r\nwould have no contradiction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mercedes don\xe2\x80\x99t marry Clarence, as George advises, I want to be taken\r\nby the legs\xe2\x80\x94my mean, cripple legs, my ridiculous kangaroo legs\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ndragged out of this bed, and out of this house. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live\r\nunder the same roof with people that will refuse so just and reasonable\r\na request.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who has refused it, Tano? Wait, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario, seeing\r\nthat Tano had hidden his head under the covers.\r\n\r\nVictoriano\xe2\x80\x99s head came out again, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cNobody says yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut the _yes_ was said.\r\n\r\nEverett took a dispatch from Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa to George, saying that whenever\r\nClarence came, Mercedes would go with him, as George suggested.\r\n\r\nThere would be five days only before another steamer would arrive, but\r\nby telegraphing to Clarence on that day, he would have time to take the\r\nsteamer next morning, or go on the cars to Los Angeles, and take the\r\nsteamer at Wilmington. And this was what Clarence telegraphed he would\r\ndo, suggesting that if Mercita would be ready, they could take the same\r\nboat, and by again taking the cars at Los Angeles, be with Gabriel in\r\ntwo days.\r\n\r\nWas it a dream? To see Clarence within five days, and be his wife, when\r\nshe thought she might never see him on this earth again! Thus ran\r\nMercedes\xe2\x80\x99 reflections, when she had gone to her room to open a wardrobe\r\nwhich had been locked for three years. That wardrobe held the\r\n_trousseau_ sent by Mrs. Lawrence Mechlin in \xe2\x80\x9974, and the jewelry which\r\nClarence had given her in New York.\r\n\r\nMercedes thought of those days, and the image of her father arose before\r\nher vividly. She sat by the window to think of him with loving\r\ntenderness and ever living regret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, _mon Dieu_, mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Madame Halier, coming in, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you come? Miss Carlota is waiting to begin getting your things\r\nready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg pardon; I had forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mercedes, rousing herself from her\r\nreverie. Carlota, Rosario and Alice now came in, and soon the contents\r\nof the wardrobe were distributed all over the room. Madame Halier was to\r\npack in trunks all Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 things, leaving out only her bridal attire\r\nand traveling dress. The madame did her work with pleasure, as she was\r\ngoing with Mercedes, and had been wishing to visit the city of San\r\nFrancisco for a long time.\r\n\r\nEverything was ready. A dispatch came from George saying that Clarence\r\nhad started; that Gabriel was a little better, and anxious to see\r\nMercedes. This made Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa feel that it was her imperative duty to\r\nsend Mercedes to her brother at once.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darrell went to see the priest about going to the rancho to perform\r\nthe marriage ceremony there. The good man would have preferred that it\r\nwere solemnized in the church, but, considering that Victoriano could\r\nnot leave his bed and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa was still in very deep mourning, he\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nThere would be no invited guests except the Holmans and Darrells. There\r\nwould be no bridesmaids either, though there were plenty of young girls\r\nthat could act as such.\r\n\r\nEverett went to town the night before the arrival of the steamer to\r\nbring Clarence as soon as he landed, and they came from town so quickly\r\nand noiselessly that no one knew when they arrived at the rancho.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were all in Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 room discussing the wedding outfit and\r\nother matters, when it occurred to her to go out and from the veranda\r\nlook towards the road, as she might perhaps see the carriage in the\r\ndistance. What was her surprise when, on passing by the parlor door, she\r\nsaw Everett coming through the gate, and there, right there, where\r\nClarence had stood on that terrible night when he left her, there he\r\nstood again, looking at her with those same speaking, glowing, loving\r\neyes. He seemed to her like an apparition, and she uttered an\r\nexclamation of surprise, turning very pale and tottering as if about to\r\nfall. In an instant he was by her side pressing her to his heart and\r\ncovering her face with kisses.\r\n\r\nSurely this was no ghost. His warm kisses and beating heart spoke of the\r\nlover full of life and hope, trembling with the realization of years of\r\nlonging to hold her thus close, very close in his loving, chaste\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMercedes, my own, my sweet wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and his voice had so much\r\nthe same tone and vibration as in that last memorable night, that the\r\nrush of sad memories and painful emotions made her for a moment feel\r\nconfused, bewildered, almost losing consciousness. As her yielding form\r\nrelaxed in his arms he carried her to the sofa and sat there holding\r\nher, scarcely realizing it was not all a dream.\r\n\r\nEverett had gone to Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s room, and now that impatient invalid\r\nwas screaming for Clarence to come. His loud calling brought Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa\r\nto him, and then all the family learned that Clarence had arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, you truant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victoriano to Clarence, \xe2\x80\x9ccome here, you\r\nugly man.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Clarence stooped to embrace him, he clasped him to his\r\nheart, making him lie down by his side. \xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI have given\r\nyou a good hugging; now go and kiss the girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhich Clarence did gladly, but his mother and Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa he kissed\r\nfirst. He then went to the parlor, where he was kindly greeted by no\r\nless than fourteen girls, counting thus: three Alamares, three Holmans,\r\nfour Darrells, and four other Alamares, cousins of Mercedes.\r\n\r\nClarence was a brave fellow, so he never flinched and kissed them all,\r\nvery deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cNot to give offence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\nThere was one duty which Clarence shrank from performing, but which he\r\nsubmitted to quietly, and that was meeting his father.\r\n\r\nDarrell came to the Alamar house for the first time in his life, and as\r\nhe said he would like to be alone when he met Clarence, Rosario\r\nconducted him to _the office_, a room used by her father when he saw\r\npeople on business and where he wrote his letters, but where others of\r\nthe family scarcely ever entered.\r\n\r\nClarence was shocked to see how aged his father was. When he left, the\r\nauburn hair of the old man showed no white lines at all. Now he was so\r\ngray that his hair was almost white. The sight of that white hair swept\r\nfrom Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s heart all trace of resentment, and his love for his\r\nfather seemed to rush back to him with pain, but with great force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, father!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Clarence, seeing the open arms before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy, my best beloved,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, with a sob and a checking\r\nof breath, holding his son close to his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFather, why are you so gray?\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I did you a great wrong. Because I murdered the Don, and he was\r\nthe best man I ever saw.\xe2\x80\x9d When Darrell said this he completely lost his\r\nself-control and wept like a child. Clarence wept with him, for he felt\r\ndeeply Don Mariano\xe2\x80\x99s death, but thought he must speak kindly to his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not murder him; don\xe2\x80\x99t think that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did. My wickedness helped the wickedness of others to kill him.\r\nAnd our wickedness combined brought infinite misery upon this innocent\r\nfamily. But a merciful God brought you back, and I know you will devote\r\nyour life to repair as much as it is possible the wrong your father did.\r\nI know you will be a good husband, but for _my sake_, also, I beg you to\r\nbe a devoted son to the widowed lady whom I have injured so frightfully.\r\nA wrong legislation authorized _us squatters_, sent us, to the land of\r\nthese innocent, helpless people to rob them. A wrong legislation killed\r\nthe Texas Pacific, and such legislation is the main cause of the Don\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath. But I, too, helped the wrong-doers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t blame yourself so much,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarence remonstrated gently, trying to\r\nsoothe his father. \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge and Lizzie told me that all the family\r\nbelieve that the disappointment at the failure of the Texas Pacific was\r\nwhat killed Don Mariano. It preyed upon his mind; it saddened, worried\r\nand sickened him until it utterly undermined his health and broke down\r\nhis nervous system. It did the same with Mr. Mechlin. So, you see, those\r\nwho defeated the Texas Pacific are to blame for the death of these two\r\nmost excellent men, but not yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am. No man can injure his fellow-man, and then shift the blame\r\non some one else\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, because others had a share in the wrong\r\ndone. Each man must stand and bear his proportion of blame. I could and\r\nshould have prevented the settlers from destroying the Don\xe2\x80\x99s cattle. If\r\nI had done so, he would not have been obliged to take them all at once.\r\nHe could have sent them in small bands, but he was afraid of the\r\nmurderous rifles of _my friends_. So the poor, dumb animals perished in\r\nthe snow. But this was not the worst; the saddest was yet to come.\r\nVictoriano lost his health, and the Don lost his life. The good, the\r\nbest of men, was right when, in his dying moments, he said: \xe2\x80\x98_The sins\r\nof our legislators brought me to this_.\xe2\x80\x99 That was a truth uttered by a\r\njust and noble soul as it passed away. Still, I must feel I am\r\nindividually to blame for the sorrow brought upon this family. I know\r\nthat if the railroad had been built the Don could have recuperated his\r\nfortune, but yet my share of wrong-doing stands there all the same; I\r\nmust bear it myself. If I had not driven you away, you could have\r\nprevented their misfortunes. I was a monster. So now I beg and entreat,\r\nfor my own sake, and as a slight reparation for my cruelty, that you be\r\nkind to that lady, as kind as if you were her own child.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, father; I vow I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is enough. I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep your word. Now, my boy, heaven bless\r\nyou, and your father\xe2\x80\x99s blessing will go with you always. Now, go, and\r\nwhen the ceremony is to be performed, send Willie to call me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs everything was ready, the marriage ceremony took place as soon as the\r\npriest arrived. Victoriano was brought to the parlor in an arm-chair,\r\nand managed to stand up, held by Everett and Webster. Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa wept\r\nall the time and so did her daughters, but everybody understood that\r\nmemories of the sad past, but no fears for the future, caused those\r\ntears to flow.\r\n\r\nThe parting with her mother and sisters was most painful to Mercedes.\r\nClarence feared she would make herself ill with weeping. He put his arms\r\naround her waist and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be disheartened. I have been thinking that Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa and all\r\nthe family had better come to San Francisco to live. If she does, I\r\nthink we can persuade George to bring his family also to reside there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa shook her head doubtingly, but Mercedes asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think George might come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, and he can then carry out there our plan of establishing a bank.\r\nSan Diego is dead now, and will remain so for many years, but San\r\nFrancisco is a good business field. So we can all locate ourselves\r\nthere, and Gabriel and Tano go into business easily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBusiness without capital? See where my poor Gabriel is now,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa answered, sadly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, but if you will sell your rancho, they will have plenty\r\nof capital. Even at two dollars per acre, your rancho, being forty-seven\r\nthousand acres\xe2\x80\x94if sold at that low figure\xe2\x80\x94would bring you ninety-four\r\nthousand dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who, who will buy mortgaged land, full of squatters, and without a\r\npatent, in this dead place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will. I will pay you more than ninety-four thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x94more than\r\ndouble that amount\xe2\x80\x94besides paying you for the lost cattle, which will be\r\nno more than what is right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree to that, but as for selling the land, if my\r\nchildren are willing, I shall be, for this place is too full of sad\r\nmemories, and will be sadder yet if I cannot have my children with me.\r\nWhen Gabriel and Victoriano get well, talk to them about buying the\r\nrancho, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you ought to pay any such high price. You\r\nare too generous to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, I am not. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget I am a money-making Yankee. I think\r\nfour\xe2\x80\x94or even three\xe2\x80\x94dollars per acre is a high price for land in this\r\ncounty _now_, but I can wait years, and then I shall double the price\r\npaid now. So, you see, I am not a bit generous. I am trying to make\r\nmoney out of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk to the boys. See what George and Gabriel say,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa said,\r\nsmiling sadly at Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s wily argument and earnest manner.\r\n\r\nThe last adieux were said, but the parting was less painful to Mercedes,\r\nwith the new hope held out by Clarence of a probability of being\r\nreunited soon in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nWhen Clarence and Mercedes arrived at their home they found that George\r\nand Lizzie had propped up Gabriel with pillows, and he was sitting up to\r\nreceive his sister. From that day he began to improve slowly but\r\nperceptibly.\r\n\r\nThe letters from home spoke of Victoriano\xe2\x80\x99s marked improvement, but\r\nstill his malady was not cured; so Clarence proposed that Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa,\r\nthe two girls and Tano should come up immediately. She could then make\r\nup her mind whether she would like to make San Francisco her home, and\r\nthe change of climate would perhaps do Victoriano good. The idea was\r\nhighly approved by all, and that same evening Mercedes wrote to her\r\nmother, begging her to come and see whether she liked San Francisco for\r\na home; that she and Clarence were going to Europe on a visit in the\r\nfall, and she wanted to leave her mamma and sisters and brothers all\r\ntogether; that George and Gabriel liked the plan of selling the rancho\r\nto Clarence very much, and wanted to talk to her and Tano about it. Thus\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa was enticed and persuaded to leave the home of her joys and\r\nsorrows, where she had lived for thirty years. Carlota and Rosario were\r\nwilling to go, and Tano was most anxious to find a way of making a\r\nliving, for he was every day more in love with Alice, but could not\r\nthink of marrying her until he knew how he was going to support a\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa, Carlota and Rosario, therefore, escorted by Victoriano,\r\nfound themselves, on a bright morning, in the Southern Pacific Railroad\r\ncars, on their way from Los Angeles to San Francisco. There were only\r\nabout a dozen persons besides themselves on the entire train.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder why they put on so many cars. One would carry all the\r\npassengers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rosario.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a car would be more than enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlota added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must lose money running empty cars,\xe2\x80\x9d Tano observed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of\r\nit. They were so anxious to leave San Diego out in the cold, I hope they\r\nwill lose money with this road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t wish that, it is unkind, unchristian, ungenerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why not? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they kill our road, the Texas Pacific, to build\r\nthis road? What consideration had they for us? I am glad that many years\r\nwill pass before they will run crowded cars over this desert. They are\r\nold men, they won\xe2\x80\x99t live to see this, their pet road, with well-filled\r\ncars, running over it, and I bet on that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tano, exultingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carlota.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know they\xe2\x80\x99ll not,\xe2\x80\x9d Tano retorted, emphatically.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Clarence and Mercedes met them in Oakland, and\r\ntogether they crossed the bay.\r\n\r\nAnd now on that same night as Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa looked from her bedroom window\r\nupon the lighted city, she noticed that a large mansion near by, was\r\nvery brightly illuminated, and Mercedes told her that one of the\r\nrailroad kings, who had killed the Texas Pacific, lived there, and was\r\ngiving a \xe2\x80\x9c_silver wedding_\xe2\x80\x9d party to the _elite_ of San Francisco. Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa sighed, and sat at the window to think.\r\n\r\nTruly, San Francisco had been in a flutter for ten days past, and the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbest society\xe2\x80\x9d had stretched its neck until it ached to see who got\r\ninvitations for \xe2\x80\x9c_The Great Nob Hill Silver Wedding Ball_\xe2\x80\x9d of one of San\r\nFrancisco\xe2\x80\x99s millionaires. Mrs. Grundy ascertained who were to be the\r\nbest-dressed ladies, what their pedigree was, and how their money had\r\nbeen made, and then Mrs. Grundy went to the ball, too.\r\n\r\nWhen all the elegance of San Francisco had arrived, nobly sprinkled with\r\na Baron or two, and ornamented with a Lord and Lady and a Marquise or\r\nCount, the great millionaire proceeded to astonish his guests in the\r\nmanner he had conceived to be most novel and startling.\r\n\r\nThe band struck up a wedding march, and Mr. Millionaire, with his wife\r\nleaning on his arm, proceeded to the last of an elegant _suite_ of\r\nrooms, where, under a canopy of fragrant flowers, a mock marriage\r\nceremony was to be performed. After conducting the blushing bride to the\r\nmock altar, and the ceremony being over, the millionaire thought he\r\nwould treat his guests to what he imagined to be a real hymenean\r\noration. He prefaced his homily with what he believed to be witticisms\r\nand quotations of his own. He then thought it was time to wax eloquent\r\nand didactic, above prejudices, truly large-minded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me read to you a short, telling lesson now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, swelling\r\nwith just pride; \xe2\x80\x9cI speak most particularly to the young men, to those\r\nwho have yet their fortunes to make. Be not discouraged if you meet with\r\nhardships and trials. Go ahead and persevere. Look at all these\r\nluxurious appurtenances surrounding us! I might well say, look at this\r\nwealth! Look at this splendor! Well, ladies and gentlemen, sixteen years\r\nago we were in Sacramento, so poor, that we had to put tin pans over our\r\nbed to catch the water that leaked through our roof, and keep our\r\nbed-clothes dry. I had not money enough to get a better roof over our\r\nheads,\xe2\x80\x9d and the millionaire looked around for applause, but none came,\r\nbecause the guests possessed the good taste, or, perhaps, bad, which\r\ntheir host lacked, and were pained and mortified; they did not see the\r\ngood of waking up memories of unsavory poverty. The foreign nobility was\r\nnot so proud, perhaps, as they had been at the hour of receiving an\r\ninvitation to all this so very newly created splendor. But the rich man,\r\nstill inflated with pride, hurriedly wound up his peroration as best he\r\ncould, feeling vague misgivings that he had marred the _eclat_ of his\r\nmagnificent illumination shining over his costly furniture, by trying to\r\nrise above himself to make a high-minded, witty speech. \xe2\x80\x9cBe plucky, and\r\npersevering, and go ahead, as I did,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to close his oration,\r\nbowing to his foreign guests.\r\n\r\nThe company scattered in couples or in groups over the luxuriously\r\nfurnished and richly decorated rooms, and Mrs. Grundy hurried about\r\neverywhere to catch the comments made by the grateful guests upon \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nbrilliant speech of their amiable host.\xe2\x80\x9d At the very first group she\r\nheard a young man say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I would be _plucky and persevering_ if I had an associate in\r\nWashington with plenty of money to bribe people so that no other\r\nrailroad could be built to start competition in California.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could be plucky, too, if the Government had given me millions of\r\nmoney and more millions of acres to build two railroads, and which\r\nmillions I never intended to pay back,\xe2\x80\x9d said another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for which millions you never paid taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d added another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTaxes? Bah! Let the poor people pay taxes. Why should railroad magnates\r\npay taxes when they have money to fight the law? Absurd!\xe2\x80\x9d said a fourth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go and take ices; the brilliancy of our host\xe2\x80\x99s oration makes me\r\nthirsty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd while all this went on in the brilliantly lighted mansion, Do\xc3\xb1a\r\nJosefa sat at her window in the dark, thinking of what \xe2\x80\x9c_might have\r\nbeen_\xe2\x80\x9d if those railroad men had not blighted San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s prosperity.\r\nHer husband would have been alive, and Mr. Mechlin, also, and her sons\r\nwould not have been driven to poverty and distress, and perhaps lost\r\ntheir health forever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod of Justice, is this right, that so many should be sacrificed\r\nbecause a few men want more millions? Our family is one of the many who\r\nhave suffered so much. Oh! so much! And all to what end? For what? Ah!\r\nthe same answer again, because a few heartless men want more millions,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nsaid she, with her face bathed in tears.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa evidently did not believe that because \xe2\x80\x9c_misery there must\r\nalways be in the world, no matter who causes it_,\xe2\x80\x9d that she was called\r\nupon to stoically submit to unmerited infliction. In a mild and\r\ndignified way, her mind rebelled. She regarded the acts of the men who\r\ncaused her husband\xe2\x80\x99s ruin and death with genuine abhorrence. To her,\r\nrectitude and equity had a clear meaning impossible to pervert. No\r\nsubtle sophistry could blur in her mind the clear line dividing right\r\nfrom wrong. She knew that among men the word business means inhumanity\r\nto one another; it means justification of rapacity; it means the freedom\r\nof man to crowd and crush his fellow-man; it means the sanction of the\r\nShylockian principle of exacting the pound of flesh. She knew all this,\r\nbut the illustration, the ocular demonstration, had never been before\r\nher until now in that gay house, in that brightly illuminated mansion,\r\nand she sadly contrasted her sorrow with their gayety, and continued her\r\nsoliloquy: \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt those people think they have a right to rejoice and\r\nfeast with the money extorted in crushing so many people\xe2\x80\x94the killing of\r\nmy darling. Doubtless they say that they earned the money in *BUSINESS*,\r\nand that allegation is all-sufficient; that one word justifies in the\r\npursuit of riches everything mean, dishonest, rapacious, unfair,\r\ntreacherous, unjust, and fraudulent. After a man makes his money no one\r\ncares how he made it, and so those people dance while I mourn for my\r\nbeloved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor hours Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa sat at that window, weeping sadly, while the\r\nothers danced gayly.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, when she had been for some time in San Francisco, she had\r\nyet stronger demonstrations, and her sense of justice and her ideas of\r\nmoral adjustment of men\xe2\x80\x99s actions with principle, received additional\r\nshocks, quite as painful as seeing the millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s palace illuminated,\r\nwhile the humble houses he had desolated must remain dark.\r\n\r\nDo\xc3\xb1a Josefa frankly spoke to the ladies who had called on her, of the\r\ncause of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death. She did so in answer to their inquiries.\r\nShe, on two or three occasions, mentioned how painful it had been to sit\r\nby the window looking at that house of rejoicing, while thinking that if\r\nthose rich men had had more sense of justice and less greed of money,\r\nthat her husband could have been spared to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say that, my dear lady, for you will give great offense,\xe2\x80\x9d said an\r\nold friend, who having heard that Clarence was worth twelve million\r\ndollars, had called on her, suddenly remembering that she used to know\r\nthe Alamares years ago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I give offense? It is the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Do\xc3\xb1a Josefa replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be, but you cannot speak against such rich people; San\r\nFrancisco society will turn against you,\xe2\x80\x9d was the rejoinder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it is a crime _to speak_ of the wrongs we have suffered, but it is\r\nnot a crime _to commit_ those wrongs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I am not a moralist. But this I do know, that if you\r\naccuse those rich men of having done wrong, the society people will give\r\nyou the cold shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, very well, let it be so. Let the guilty rejoice and go unpunished,\r\nand the innocent suffer ruin and desolation. I slander no one, but shall\r\nspeak the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\xe2\x80\x94_Out with the Invader._\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet infamy be that man\xe2\x80\x99s portion who uses his power to corrupt, to\r\nruin, to debase,\xe2\x80\x9d says Channing, in righteous indignation, speaking of\r\nthe atrocities perpetrated by Napoleon the First to gratify his vanity\r\nand ambition. Further on, with increasing earnestness, Channing adds:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn anguish of spirit we exclaim: \xe2\x80\x98How long will an abject world kiss\r\nthe foot that tramples it? How long shall crime find shelter in its very\r\naggravations and excess?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf Channing lived now, his \xe2\x80\x98anguish of spirit\xe2\x80\x99 would be far greater to\r\nfind in his own country, firmly enthroned, _a power that corrupts, ruins\r\nand debases_ as utterly as that which he so eloquently deplored, and his\r\nown fellow-citizens\xe2\x80\x94the free-born Americans\xe2\x80\x94ready and willing to _kiss\r\nthe foot that tramples them_!\r\n\r\nNot infamy, but honor and wealth, is the portion of the men who corrupt\r\nand ruin and debase in this country. Honor and wealth for the Napoleons\r\nof this land, whose power the sons of California can neither check, nor\r\nthwart, nor escape, nor withstand. And in California, as in France,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccrime finds shelter in its very aggravations and excess,\xe2\x80\x9d for after ten\r\nyears of fighting in Congress against legislation that would have given\r\nto the people of the Southern States and the Pacific Coast a competing\r\nrailway; and after fighting against creating a sinking fund to\r\nre-imburse moneys due to the Government, and fighting against laws to\r\nregulate freights and fares on a fair basis, they (the Napoleons) refuse\r\nto pay taxes on their gigantic property, thus making it necessary for\r\nthe Governor of California to call an extra session of the Legislature\r\nto devise some new laws which will compel those defiant millionaires to\r\npay taxes, and not leave upon the shoulders of poor people the onerous\r\nduty of defraying public expenses.\r\n\r\nIs not this \xe2\x80\x9caggravation of excess?\xe2\x80\x9d Excess of defiance? Excess of\r\nlawlessness? How insidiously these monopolists began their work of\r\naccumulation, which has culminated in a power that not only eludes the\r\nlaw of the land, but defies, derides it! They were poor men. They came\r\nbefore the Government at Washington, and before the people of\r\nCalifornia, as suppliant petitioners, humbly begging for aid to\r\nconstruct a railroad. The aid was granted most liberally, and as soon as\r\nthey accumulated sufficient capital to feel rich they began their work\r\nof eluding and defying the law. They became insolent, flinging defiance,\r\nas if daring the law to touch them, and truly, the law thus far has been\r\npowerless with them. At Washington they won their first victories\r\nagainst the American people; and now California has the shame of seeing\r\nthat she has not the power to enforce her laws upon the men she made\r\nrich. The Legislature convened and adjourned, and there is no way yet of\r\ncompelling the insolent millionaires to pay their taxes or regulate\r\ntheir rates on freights and fares!\r\n\r\nIt seems now that unless _the people of California take the law in their\r\nown hands_, and seize the property of those men, and confiscate it, to\r\nre-imburse the money due _the people_, the arrogant corporation will\r\nnever pay. They are so accustomed to appropriate to themselves what\r\nrightfully belongs to others, and have so long stood before the world in\r\ndefiant attitude, that they have become utterly insensible to those\r\nsentiments of fairness animating law-abiding men of probity and sense of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThese monopolists are essentially dangerous citizens in the fullest\r\nacceptance of the word. They are dangerous citizens, not only in being\r\nguilty of violation of the law, in subverting the fundamental principles\r\nof public morality, but they are dangerous citizens, because they _lead\r\nothers_ into the commission of the same crimes. Their example is deadly\r\nto honorable sentiments; it is poison to Californians, because it\r\nallures men with the glamour of success; it incites the unwary to\r\nimitate the conduct of men who have become immensely rich by such\r\nculpable means.\r\n\r\nMr. Huntington in his letters (made public in the Colton suit), shows\r\nthe truth of all this; shows how bribing and corrupting seemed to him\r\nperfectly correct. He speaks of \xe2\x80\x9cthe men that can be _convinced_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(meaning the men that will take bribes), as naturally as if no one need\r\nblush for it. And with the same frankness he discloses his maneuvering\r\nto defeat the Texas Pacific Railroad, and elude the payment of moneys\r\ndue the Government. It is surprising, as well as unpleasant, to read in\r\nMr. Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s letters the names of men in high positions whom he\r\nreckons in his list as \xe2\x80\x9cmen who can _be convinced_\xe2\x80\x9d and he speaks of\r\nthem in a cool way and off-hand manner, which shows how little respect\r\nhe has for those whom he can _convince_. Perhaps there are some in his\r\nlist who never did take a bribe from him, but then those gentlemen are\r\nin the position of \xe2\x80\x9cOld Dog Tray,\xe2\x80\x9d who suffered for being in bad\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have set matters to work in the South that I think will switch most\r\nof the South from Tom Scott\xe2\x80\x99s Texas and Pacific bill,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc., Mr.\r\nHuntington wrote in April, \xe2\x80\x9975, and in November of the same year he\r\nconcluded to send Dr. Gwin to work on the credulity of the Southerners,\r\nto switch them off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the doctor can do us some good if he can work under cover. * *\r\n* He must not come to the surface as _our man_. * * * Not as our agent,\r\nbut as an anti-subsidy Democrat and a Southern man,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. When the\r\ndeceiver returned, Mr. Huntington wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI notice what you say about\r\nthe interest that Dr. Gwin should have. I have no doubt that we shall\r\nagree about what his interest should be,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Huntington, speaking\r\nof the price to be paid the ex-Senator for his work of helping to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_switch off the South_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another letter Mr. Huntington says: \xe2\x80\x9cI had a talk with Bristow,\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. He will be likely to help us fix up our\r\nmatters with the Government on a fair basis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother letter says: \xe2\x80\x9cI am doing all I can to have the Government take\r\nsix million acres of land, and give the railroad company credit for\r\nfifteen million dollars, etc. I wish you would have the newspapers take\r\nthe ground that this land ought to be taken by the Government and held\r\nfor the people, etc. Something that the demagogues can vote and work\r\nfor,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Huntington also says: \xe2\x80\x9cI think there should be a bridge company\r\norganized (that we are not in) to build over the Colorado River, etc. In\r\nthis way we could tax the through business on this line should we so\r\ndesire,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated March 7th, 1877, he says: \xe2\x80\x9cI stayed in\r\nWashington two days to fix up a Railroad Committee in the Senate. * * *\r\nThe Committee is just as we want it, which is a very important thing for\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x9d * * *\r\n\r\nHe again says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Committees are made up for the Forty-fifth Congress.\r\nI think the Railroad Committee is right, but the Committees on\r\nTerritories I do not like. A different one was promised me. Sherrel has\r\njust telegraphed me to come to Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Huntington mentions in other letters the fact of bills being\r\nsubmitted to him before being put to vote; and also about being\r\nconsulted concerning the formation of Committees and other Congressional\r\nmatters, much as if Congress really wished to keep on the good side of\r\nMr. Huntington. But it looked also as if he did not have everything his\r\nown way always, for at times he loses patience and calls Congress a \xe2\x80\x9cset\r\nof the worst strikers,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe hungriest set\xe2\x80\x9d he ever saw.\r\n\r\nIn his letter to his friend Colton, of June 20th, \xe2\x80\x9978, he exclaims: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink in the world\xe2\x80\x99s history never before was such a wild set of\r\ndemagogues honored by the name of Congress. We have been hurt some, but\r\nsome of the worst bills have been defeated, but we cannot stand many\r\nsuch Congresses,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nThe thing that annoyed Mr. Huntington the most was that he could not\r\npersuade Governor Stanford to tell the bare-faced falsehood, that the\r\nSouthern Pacific did not belong to the owners of the Central Pacific.\r\n\r\nAgain and again Mr. Huntington urged the necessity of this falsehood\r\nbeing told, childishly forgetting the fact that such prevarications\r\nwould have been useless, as all Californians knew the truth.\r\n\r\nIn the Congressional Committees, however, he himself attempted to pass\r\noff that misstatement. It is not likely that he was believed, but he\r\nsucceeded in killing the Texas Pacific, and in \xe2\x80\x9cseeing the grass grow\r\nover Tom Scott.\xe2\x80\x9d The subterfuge no doubt was useful.\r\n\r\nMr. Huntington having buried the Texas Pacific, and also Colonel Scott,\r\nas well as other worthy people (of whom no mention has been made in this\r\nbook), now proceeded to demand that the Government surrender to him and\r\nassociates, the land subsidy granted by Congress to the Texas Pacific.\r\n\r\nThis, surely, is an \xe2\x80\x9c_aggravation of excess_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe House Committee on Public Lands in their report on the \xe2\x80\x9c_forfeiture\r\nof the Texas Pacific land grant_\xe2\x80\x9d reviewed Mr. Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s acts with\r\nmerited severity. Amongst many other truths the report says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nSouthern Pacific claims to \xe2\x80\x98stand in _the shoes_\xe2\x80\x99 of the Texas Pacific.\r\nYour committee agree that \xe2\x80\x98standing in the shoes\xe2\x80\x99 would do if the\r\nSouthern Pacific _filled the shoes_.\xe2\x80\x9d But it does not. It never had\r\nauthority or recognition by Congress east of Yuma. For its own purpose,\r\nby _methods which honest men have denounced_, greedy to embrace all land\r\nwithin its net-work of rails, to secure monopoly of transportation,\r\nsurmounting opposition and beating down all obstacles in its way, and in\r\ndoing so, crushing the agent Congress had selected as instrument to\r\nbuild a road there, _doing nothing, absolutely nothing, by governmental\r\nauthority or assent even, and having succeeded in defeating a necessary\r\nwork and rendering absolutely abortive the attempt to have one competing\r\ntransportation route to the Pacific built, it coolly asks to bestow upon\r\nit fifteen millions of acres of lands; to give it the ownership of an\r\narea sufficient for perhaps one hundred thousand homes, as a reward for\r\nthat result_.\r\n\r\nAnd the committee (with one dissenting voice only) reported their\r\nopinion that the Southern Pacific Railroad Company had _neither legal\r\nnor equitable_ claim to the lands of the Texas Pacific which Mr.\r\nHuntington wished to appropriate.\r\n\r\nBut is it not a painful admission that these few men should have\r\nthwarted and defeated the purpose and intent of the Government of the\r\nUnited States of having a competing railway in the Texas Pacific? Not\r\nonly Colonel Scott, and Hon. John C. Brown, and Mr. Frank T. Bond, the\r\nPresident and Vice President of this road, but also Senator Lamar, Mr.\r\nJ. W. Throckmorton, Mr. House, Mr. Chandler, of Mississippi, and many,\r\nmany other able speakers, honorable, upright men, all endeavored\r\nfaithfully to aid the construction of the Texas Pacific. All failed. The\r\nfalsehoods disseminated by ex-Senator Gwin, which Senator Gordon and\r\nothers believed, and thus in good faith reproduced, had more effect when\r\nbacked by the monopoly\xe2\x80\x99s money.\r\n\r\nBut Tom Scott is laid low, and so is the Texas Pacific; now the fight\r\nfor greedy accumulation is transferred to California. The monopoly is\r\nconfident of getting the land subsidy of the Texas Pacific\xe2\x80\x94after killing\r\nit; of getting every scrap that might be clutched under pretext of\r\nhaving belonged to the decapitated road. Thus the lands that the City of\r\nSan Diego donated to Tom Scott _on condition_ that the Texas Pacific\r\nshould be built, even these, the monopoly has by some means seized upon.\r\nNo Texas Pacific was built, but nevertheless, though clearly specified\r\nstipulations be violated, San Diego\xe2\x80\x99s lands must go into the voracious\r\njaws of the monster. Poor San Diego! After being ruined by the greed of\r\nthe heartless monopolists, she is made to contribute her widow\xe2\x80\x99s mite to\r\nswell the volume of their riches! This is cruel irony indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd now those pampered millionaires have carried their defiance of the\r\nlaw to the point of forcing the Governor of California to call an extra\r\nsession of the Legislature to compel them to obey the law. Speaking of\r\nthese matters a very able orator said in one of his speeches in the\r\nextra session:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is stated in the proclamation of the Governor to convene this\r\nLegislature, that for three or four years past the principal railroads\r\nin this State have set at defiance the laws of the people; that they\r\nhave refused to pay their taxes; that they had set up within our borders\r\nan _imperium in imperio_; that they had avowed and declared themselves\r\nfree from the laws of the State under which they hold their\r\norganization; that there were no laws in this State to which they were\r\nbound to submit and pay such taxes as would have fallen to them had they\r\nbeen subject to the laws of the State, etc., etc. It has not occurred\r\nbefore in the United States that a great Commonwealth has been defied\r\nsuccessfully by its own creatures.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOther speakers followed, and we of California have now, at least, the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that faithful hearts and bright intellects have\r\nbeen aroused and are watching the strides of the monster power.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish population of the State are proud of their countryman,\r\nReginaldo del Valle, who was one of the first to take a bold stand\r\nagainst the monopoly. This young orator with great ability and\r\nindomitable energy, has never flagged in his eloquent denunciations of\r\nthe power which has so trampled the laws of California and the rights of\r\nher children.\r\n\r\nMr. Breckinridge, another brilliant orator, speaking of the pertinacious\r\ndefiance of the law exhibited by the monopolists, said: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing but a\r\nshock, a violent shock, a rude lesson\xe2\x80\x94such as the old French noblesse\r\ngot when they saw their chateaux fired and their sons guillotined\xe2\x80\x94will\r\nawaken them from their dream of security.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe champions of right fought well, fought nobly, in the legislature,\r\nbut alas! the gold of the monopoly was too powerful, and the _extra\r\nsession_, called to devise means of compelling the railroad corporation\r\nto obey the law, adjourned\xe2\x80\x94adjourned, having _failed_ in accomplishing\r\nthe object for which it was called.\r\n\r\nThe legislators themselves acknowledged that corruption was too strong\r\nto be withstood. Mr. Nicol said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was once a belief that the legislature of California was a high,\r\nhonorable body, into which it should be the pride and glory of fathers\r\nto see their sons gain admission. I have been here two sessions, and\r\ninstead of being a place to which an honorable ambition should prompt a\r\nyoung man to aspire, I believe it to be the worst place on the\r\ncontinent. _We are surrounded by a lobby which degrades every man here\r\nby constant temptation and offers of corruption; the monopoly has made\r\nit no place where a careful father will send his son._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf these powerful monopolists were to speak candidly, would they say\r\nthat the result of their struggle for money in the last fourteen years\r\nof their lives has compensated them for that shoulder-to shoulder fight\r\nwith opponents who were in the right, and must be vanquished by foul\r\nmeans? \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see the grass grow over Tom Scott,\xe2\x80\x9d prophetically wrote\r\nMr. Huntington several times. He had his wish. The grass grows over Tom\r\nScott. Mr. Huntington can claim the glory of having laid low his\r\npowerful opponent, for it is well known that the ten years\xe2\x80\x99 struggle for\r\nthe Texas Pacific undermined Colonel Scott\xe2\x80\x99s health beyond recovery.\r\nBroken down in health, he left Mr. Huntington master of the field. But\r\nis the victory worth the cost? The fight was certainly not glorious for\r\nthe victor. Is it to be profitable? Many lives have been wrecked, many\r\npeople impoverished, much injustice done, and all for the sake of having\r\nthe Southern Pacific Railroad without a rival, without competition. This\r\nroad runs mostly through a desert; how is it to be made profitable? In\r\ntheir eager pursuit of riches, the projectors of it miscalculated the\r\ninevitable, and did not foresee that other capital could, in a few\r\nyears, build competing lines through more favorable routes; did not\r\nforesee that it would have been a better policy to adhere honestly to\r\nthe terms of their first charter; did not foresee that it would have\r\nbeen better not to sacrifice San Diego. No, they deemed it a wiser plan\r\nto kill Tom Scott, to kill San Diego, and then take the money earned in\r\nthis manner to go and build railroads in Guatemala and in British\r\nAmerica. To men who do not think that in _business_ the rights of others\r\nshould be considered, this policy of crushing or desolating everything\r\nin the path of triumphant accumulators no doubt is justifiable. But why\r\nshould the rich enjoy rights that are \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly to other men?\xe2\x80\x9d It is\r\nalleged in defense of the California railroad monopolists that as they\r\ndo not think it would be lucrative to run a railroad to San Diego, they\r\ndo not build any. If this were a true allegation, why did they fear the\r\nTexas Pacific as a competing road? Why did they spend so much money and\r\nten years of their lives to kill that railroad? Surely, if they knew so\r\nwell that a road to San Diego would not pay, why were they so anxious to\r\nprevent its construction? Was it out of a purely disinterested and\r\nphilanthropic solicitude for their rivals? Did Mr. Huntington wish \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nsee grass grow over Tom Scott\xe2\x80\x9d because he kindly desired to prevent his\r\nfinancial ruin?\r\n\r\nObviously, to maintain that the monopoly did not build a road to San\r\nDiego because it would not pay, and that they would not allow Tom Scott\r\nto build it either, for the same reason, is not logical. If to construct\r\nand run such road would have been ruinous, that was the very best of\r\nreasons for allowing it to be built. This would have been as effective a\r\nway of getting rid of Colonel Scott as by seeing grass grow over his\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nBut no, it is not true that the San Diego road would not have been\r\nprofitable; the truth is, that because it would have been profitable, it\r\nwas dreaded as a rival of the Southern Pacific. But the monopoly had no\r\nmoney to build two roads at once, so they (characteristically) thought\r\nbest to kill it. As they could not have it, no one else should. And for\r\nthis reason, and because one of the railroad kings conceived a great\r\nanimosity against the people of San Diego and became their bitter,\r\nrevengeful enemy, they were not allowed to have a railroad. This last\r\nfact seems incredibly absurd, but if we remember how a Persian tyrant\r\nrazed a city to the ground because he ate there something that gave him\r\nan indigestion, we ought not be surprised if a modern king\xe2\x80\x94one of\r\nCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s tyrants\xe2\x80\x94should punish a little city because it did not turn\r\nout _en masse_ to do him humble obeisance. Doubtless, to indulge in such\r\npetty malice was not lofty; it was a sort of mental indigestion not to\r\nbe proud of; it was a weakness, but it was also a wickedness, and worse\r\nyet, it was a _blunder_.\r\n\r\nTime alone, however, will prove this. In the meanwhile, the money earned\r\nin California (as Californians only know how) is taken to build roads in\r\nGuatemala. Towns are crushed and sacrificed in California to carry\r\nprosperity to other countries. And California groans under her heavy\r\nload, but submits, seeing her merchants and farmers ground down with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspecial contracts\xe2\x80\x9d and discriminating charges, and the refractory\r\npunished with pitiless severity. Thus, merchants and farmers are hushed\r\nand made docile under the lash, for what is the use of complaining? When\r\nthe Governor of this State sought in vain to curb the power of the\r\nmonster and compel it to pay taxes by calling an extra session of the\r\nLegislature, and nothing was done, what more can be said?\r\n\r\nAsk the settlers of the Mussel Slough what is their experience of the\r\npitiless rigor of the monopoly towards those who confidently trusted in\r\nthe good faith of the great power. These poor farmers were told by the\r\nrailroad monopoly to locate homesteads and plant orchards and vineyards\r\nand construct irrigating canals; that they would not have to pay for\r\ntheir land any higher price than before it was improved. With this\r\nunderstanding the farmers went to work, and with great sacrifices and\r\narduous labor made their irrigating canals and other improvements. Then\r\nwhen this sandy swamp had been converted into a garden, and valueless\r\nlands made very valuable, the monopoly came down on the confiding people\r\nand demanded the price of the land after it had been improved. The\r\nfarmers remonstrated and asked that the original agreement should be\r\nrespected; but all in vain. The arm of the law was called to eject them.\r\nThey resisted, and bloodshed was the consequence. Some of them were\r\nkilled, but all had to submit, there was no redress.\r\n\r\nAnd what price did the monopoly pay for these lands? Not one penny, dear\r\nreader. These lands are a little bit of a small portion out of many\r\nmillions of acres given as a subsidy, a _gift_, to build the Southern\r\nPacific Railroad, which road, the charter said, was to pass through San\r\nDiego and terminate at Fort Yuma.\r\n\r\nThe line of this road was changed without authority. [Mr. Huntington\r\ntalks in his letters about _convincing_ people to make this change.]\r\nThus the Mussel Slough farmers got _taken in_, into Mr. Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlines\xe2\x80\x94as was stated by the public press.\r\n\r\nBut these, as well as the blight, spread over Southern California, and\r\nover the entire Southern States, are historical facts. All of which,\r\nstrung together, would make a brilliant and most appropriate chaplet to\r\nencircle the lofty brow of the great and powerful monopoly. Our\r\nrepresentatives in Congress, and in the State Legislature, knowing full\r\nwell the will of the people, ought to legislate accordingly. If they do\r\nnot, then we shall\xe2\x80\x94as Channing said \xe2\x80\x9ckiss the foot that tramples us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand \xe2\x80\x9cin anguish of spirit\xe2\x80\x9d must wait and pray for a Redeemer who will\r\nemancipate the white slaves of California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SQUATTER AND THE DON ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Word from Project Gutenberg\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will update this book if we find any errors.\r\n\r\nThis book can be found under: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35538\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\r\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\r\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\r\nand without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s goals\r\nand ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 collection will remain freely\r\navailable for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\r\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the\r\nnumber of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\r\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of\r\nequipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\r\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\r\nthe IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where\r\nwe have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\r\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\r\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\r\nplease visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\r\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\r\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\xe2\x80\x99s eBook\r\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\r\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg\xe2\x84\xa2, including\r\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\r\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
