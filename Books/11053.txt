Harper\r\n\r\nEdited By Frances Smith Foster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam sat in her lowly cabin, painfully rocking her body to and fro;\r\nfor a great sorrow had fallen upon her life. She had been the mother of\r\nthree children, two had died in their infancy, and now her last, her\r\nloved and only child was gone, but not like the rest, who had passed\r\naway almost as soon as their little feet had touched the threshold of\r\nexistence. She had been entangled in the mazes of sin and sorrow; and\r\nher sun had gone down in darkness. It was the old story. Agnes, fair,\r\nyoung and beautiful, had been a slave, with no power to protect herself\r\nfrom the highest insults that brutality could offer to innocence. Bound\r\nhand and foot by that system, which has since gone down in wrath, and\r\nblood, and tears, she had fallen a victim to the wiles and power of her\r\nmaster; and the result was the introduction of a child of shame into a\r\nworld of sin and suffering; for herself an early grave; and for her\r\nmother a desolate and breaking heart.\r\n\r\nWhile Miriam was sitting down hopelessly beneath the shadow of her\r\nmighty grief, gazing ever and anon on the pale dead face, which seemed\r\nto bear in its sad but gentle expression, an appeal from earth to\r\nheaven, some of the slaves would hurry in, and looking upon the fair\r\nyoung face, would drop a word of pity for the weeping mother, and then\r\nhurry on to their appointed tasks. All day long Miriam sat alone with\r\nher dead, except when these kindly interruptions broke upon the monotony\r\nof her sorrow.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Camilla, the only daughter of her master, entered her\r\ncabin, and throwing her arms around her neck exclaimed, "Oh! Mammy, I am\r\nso sorry I didn\'t know Agnes was dead. I\'ve been on a visit to Mr. Le\r\nGrange\'s plantation, and I\'ve just got back this afternoon, and as soon\r\nas I heard that Agnes was dead I hurried to see you. I would not even\r\nwait for my dinner. Oh! how sweet she looks," said Camilla, bending over\r\nthe corpse, "just as natural as life. When did she die?"\r\n\r\n"This morning, my poor, dear darling!" And another burst of anguish\r\nrelieved the overcharged heart.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Mammy, don\'t cry, I am so sorry; but what is this?" said she, as\r\nthe little bundle of flannel began to stir.\r\n\r\n"That is poor Agnes\' baby."\r\n\r\n"Agnes\' baby? Why, I didn\'t know that Agnes had a baby. Do let me see\r\nit?"\r\n\r\nTenderly the grandmother unfolded the wrappings, and presented the\r\nlittle stranger. He was a beautiful babe, whose golden hair, bright blue\r\neyes and fair complexion showed no trace of the outcast blood in his\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how beautiful!" said Camilla; "surely this can\'t be Agnes\' baby. He\r\nis just as white as I am, and his eyes--what a beautiful blue--and his\r\nhair, why it is really lovely."\r\n\r\n"He is very pretty, Miss, but after all he is only a slave."\r\n\r\nA slave. She had heard that word before; but somehow, when applied to\r\nthat fair child, it grated harshly on her ear; and she said, "Well, I\r\nthink it is a shame for him to be a slave, when he is just as white as\r\nanybody. Now, Mammy," said she, throwing off her hat, and looking\r\nsoberly into the fire, "if I had my way, he should never be a slave."\r\n\r\n"And why can\'t you have your way? I\'m sure master humors you in\r\neverything."\r\n\r\n"I know that; Pa does everything I wish him to do; but I don\'t know how\r\nI could manage about this. If his mother were living, I would beg Pa to\r\nset them both free, and send them North; but his mother is gone; and,\r\nMammy, we couldn\'t spare you. And besides, it is so cold in the North,\r\nyou would freeze to death, and yet, I can\'t bear the thought of his\r\nbeing a slave. I wonder," said she, musing to herself, "I wonder if I\r\ncouldn\'t save him from being a slave. Now I have it," she said, rising\r\nhastily, her face aglow with pleasurable excitement. "I was reading\r\nyesterday a beautiful story in the Bible about a wicked king, who wanted\r\nto kill all the little boys of a people who were enslaved in his land,\r\nand how his mother hid her child by the side of a river, and that the\r\nking\'s daughter found him and saved his life. It was a fine story; and I\r\nread it till I cried. Now I mean to do something like that good\r\nprincess. I am going to ask Pa, to let me take him to the house, and\r\nhave a nurse for him, and bring him up like a white child, and never let\r\nhim know that he is colored."\r\n\r\nMiriam shook her head doubtfully; and Camilla, looking disappointed,\r\nsaid, "Don\'t you like my plan?"\r\n\r\n"Laws, honey, it would be fustrate, but your Pa wouldn\'t hear to it."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he would, Mammy, because I\'ll tell him I\'ve set my heart upon it,\r\nand won\'t be satisfied if he don\'t consent. I know if I set my heart\r\nupon it, he won\'t refuse me, because he always said he hates to see me\r\nfret. Why, Mammy, he bought me two thousand dollars worth of jewelry\r\nwhen we were in New York, just because I took a fancy to a diamond set\r\nwhich I saw at Tiffany\'s. Anyhow, I am going to ask him." Eager and\r\nanxious to carry out her plan, Camilla left the cabin to find her\r\nfather. He was seated in his library, reading Homer. He looked up, as\r\nher light step fell upon the threshold, and said playfully, "What is\r\nyour wish, my princess? Tell me, if it is the half of my kingdom."\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his manner, she drew near, perched upon his knee, and\r\nsaid; "Now, you must keep your word, Pa. I have a request to make, but\r\nyou must first promise me that you will grant it."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know what it is. I can\'t tell. You might want me to put my\r\nhead in the fire."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Pa, you know I don\'t!"\r\n\r\n"Well, you might wish me to run for Congress."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Pa, I know that you hate politics."\r\n\r\n"Well, darling, what is your request?"\r\n\r\n"No; tell me first that you will grant it. Now, don\'t tease me, Pa; say\r\nyes, and I will tell you."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes; if it is anything in reason."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is in reason, let me tell you, Pa. To-day, after I came home,\r\nI asked Annette where was Agnes, and she told me she was dead. Oh I was\r\nso sorry; and so before I got my dinner I hastened to Mammy\'s cabin, and\r\nfound poor Mammy almost heart-broken, and Agnes lying dead, but looking\r\njust as natural as life."\r\n\r\n"She was dead, but had left one of the dearest little babies I ever saw.\r\nWhy, Pa, he is just as white as we are; and I told Mammy so, but she\r\nsaid it didn\'t matter; \'he is a poor slave, just like the rest of us.\'\r\nNow, Pa, I don\'t want Agnes\' baby to be a slave. Can\'t you keep him from\r\ngrowing up a slave?"\r\n\r\n"How am I to do that, my little Abolitionist?"\r\n\r\n"No, Pa, I am not an Abolitionist. I heard some of them talk when I was\r\nin New York, and I think they are horrid creatures; but, Pa, this child\r\nis so white, nobody would ever know that he had one drop of Negro blood\r\nin his veins. Couldn\'t we take him out of that cabin, and make all the\r\nservants promise that they would never breathe a word about his being\r\ncolored, and let me bring him up as a white child?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said Mr. Le Croix, bursting into a hearty laugh, "that is a\r\ncapital joke; my little dewdrop talk of bringing up a child! Why,\r\ndarling, you would tire of him in a week."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Pa, I wouldn\'t! Just try me; if it is only for a week."\r\n\r\n"Why, Sunbeam, it is impossible. Who ever heard of such a thing as a\r\nNegro being palmed upon society as a white person?"\r\n\r\n"Negro! Pa, he is just as white as you are, and his eyes are as blue as\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n"Still he belongs to the Negro race; and one drop of that blood in his\r\nveins curses all the rest. I would grant you anything in reason, but\r\nthis is not to be thought of. Were I to do so I would immediately lose\r\ncaste among all the planters in the neighborhood; I would be set down as\r\nan Abolitionist, and singled out for insult and injury. Ask me anything,\r\nCamilla, but that."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pa, what do you care about social position? You never hunt, nor\r\nentertain company, nor take any part in politics. You shut yourself up\r\nin your library, year after year, and pore over your musty books, and\r\nhardly any one knows whether you are dead or alive. And I am sure that\r\nwe could hide the secret of his birth, and pass him off as the orphan\r\nchild of one of our friends, and that will be the truth; for Agnes was\r\nour friend; at least I know she was mine."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll see about it; now, get down, and let me finish reading this\r\nchapter."\r\n\r\nThe next day Camilla went again to the cabin of Miriam; but the overseer\r\nhad set her to a task in the field, and Agnes\' baby was left to the care\r\nof an aged woman who was too old to work in the fields, but not being\r\nentirely past service, she was appointed as one of the nurses for the\r\nbabies and young children, while their mothers were working in the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nCamilla, feeling an unusual interest in the child, went to the\r\noverseer, and demanded that Miriam should be released from her tasks,\r\nand permitted to attend the child.\r\n\r\nIn vain the overseer plead the pressure for hands, and the busy season.\r\nCamilla said it did not matter, she wanted Miriam, and she would have\r\nher; and he, feeling that it was to his interest to please the little\r\nlady, had Miriam sent from the field to Camilla.\r\n\r\n"Mammy, I want you to come to the house. I want you to come and be my\r\nMammy. Agnes is dead; your husband is gone, and I want you to come and\r\nbring the baby to the house, and I am going to get him some beautiful\r\ndresses, and some lovely coral I saw in New Orleans, and I am going to\r\ndress him so handsomely, that I believe Pa will feel just as I do, and\r\nthink it a shame that such a beautiful child should be a slave."\r\n\r\nCamilla went home, and told her father what she had done. And he,\r\nwilling to compromise with her, readily consented; and in a day or two\r\nthe child and his grandmother were comfortably ensconced in their new\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe winter passed; the weeks ripened into months, and the months into\r\nyears, and the child under the pleasant dispensations of love and\r\nkindness grew to be a fine, healthy, and handsome boy.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Mr. Le Croix was in one of his most genial moods, Camilla\r\nagain introduced the subject which she had concealed, but not abandoned.\r\n\r\n"Now, father, I do think it is a shame for this child to be a slave,\r\nwhen he is just as white as anybody; I am sure we could move away from\r\nhere to France, and you could adopt him as your son, and no one would\r\nknow anything of his birth and parentage. He is so beautiful, I would\r\nlike him for my brother; and he looks like us anyhow."\r\n\r\nLe Croix flushed deep at these words, and he looked keenly into his\r\ndaughter\'s face; but her gaze was so open, her expression so frank and\r\nartless, he could not think that her words had any covert meaning in\r\nreference to the paternity of the child; but to save that child from\r\nbeing a slave, and to hide his origin was with her a pet scheme; and, to\r\nuse her own words, "she had set her heart upon it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard Le Croix was the only son of a Spanish lady, and a French\r\ngentleman, who were married in Hayti a few months before the revolution,\r\nwhich gave freedom to the Island, and made Hayti an independent nation.\r\n\r\nHis father, foreseeing the storm which was overshadowing the land,\r\ncontrived to escape, bringing with him a large amount of personal\r\nproperty; and preferring a climate similar to his own, he bought a\r\nplantation on Red river, and largely stocked it with slaves. Only one\r\nchild blessed their union; Bernard Le Croix, who grew up sensitive, shy\r\nand retiring, with a taste for solitude and literary pursuits.\r\n\r\nDuring the troubles in Hayti, his uncle and only daughter escaped from\r\nthe Island, leaving every thing behind except the clothing upon their\r\npersons, and a few jewels they had hastily collected. Broken in spirits,\r\nfeeble in health, Louis Le Croix reached Louisiana, only to die in his\r\nbrother\'s arms and to leave his orphan daughter to his care. She was\r\nabout ten years old and Bernard was twelve, and in their childhood was\r\ncommenced a friendship which ripened into love and marriage. Bernard\'s\r\nfather and mother lived long enough to see their first and only\r\ngrandchild, and then died, leaving their son a large baronial estate,\r\n500 slaves, and a vast amount of money.\r\n\r\nPassionately fond of literature, aesthetic in his tastes, he devoted\r\nhimself to poetry and the ancient classics; filled his home with the\r\nfinest paintings and the most beautiful statuary, and had his gardens\r\nlaid out in the most exquisite manner. And into that beautiful home he\r\nbrought his young and lovely bride; but in that fair house where velvet\r\ncarpets hushed her tread, and magnificence surrounded her path, she\r\ndrooped and faded. Day by day her cheek grew paler, her footsteps\r\nslower, until she passed away like a thing of love and light, and left\r\nher heart-broken husband and a child of six summers to mourn her loss.\r\n\r\nBernard, ever shy and sensitive, grew more so after the death of his\r\nwife. He sought no society; seemed to lose all interest in politics; and\r\nsecluded himself in his library till he had almost passed from the\r\nrecollection of his nearest neighbors. He superintended the education of\r\nhis daughter, because he could not bear the thought of being separated\r\nfrom her. And she, seeing very little of society, and reading only from\r\nthe best authors, both ancient and modern, was growing up with very\r\nlittle knowledge of the world, except what she learned from books.\r\n\r\nWithout any female relatives to guide her, she had no other associates\r\nthan the servants of her household, and the family of Mr. Le Grange. Her\r\nmother\'s nurse and favorite servant had taken the charge of her after\r\nher death, and Agnes had been her nurse and companion.\r\n\r\nCamilla, although [adored?] and petted by every one, and knowing no law\r\nbut her own will, was still a very lovely child. Her father, wrapped in\r\nhis literary pursuits, had left the entire control of his plantation to\r\noverseers, in whom he trusted almost implicitly. And many a tale of\r\nwrong and sorrow came to the ear of Camilla; for these simple-minded\r\npeople had learned to love her, and to trust in her as an angel of\r\nmercy. Often would she interfere in their behalf, and tell the story of\r\ntheir wrongs to her father. And at her instance, more than one overseer\r\nhad been turned away; which, coming to the ears of others, made them\r\ncautious how they offended the little lady, for young as she was they\r\nsoon learned that she had great influence with her ease-loving father,\r\nwho would comply with almost any fancy or request rather than see her\r\nunhappy or fretting.\r\n\r\nAnd Camilla, knowing her power, insisted that Agnes\' child should be\r\nraised as a white child, and the secret of his birth effectually\r\nconcealed. At first, Mr. Le Croix thought it was a passing whim that she\r\nwould soon forget; that the child would amuse and interest her for\r\nawhile; and then she would tire of him as she had of other things; such\r\nas her birds, her squirrel, and even her Shetland pony. But when he\r\nfound that instead of her intention being a passing whim it was a\r\nsettled purpose, he made up his mind to accede to her wishes.\r\n\r\nHis plan was to take the child North, to have him educated, and then\r\nadopt him as his son. And in fact the plan rather suited him; for then\r\nhe could care for him as a son, without acknowledging the relationship.\r\nAnd being a member of two nations having a Latin basis, he did not feel\r\nthe same pride of race and contempt and repulsion for weaker races which\r\ncharacterizes the proud and imperious Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nThe next Summer Mr. Le Croix took a journey to the North, taking Louis\r\nand Camilla with him. He found a very pleasant family school in New\r\nEngland; and having made suitable arrangements, he left Louis in the\r\ncare of the matron, whose kindness and attentions soon won the child\'s\r\nheart; and before he left the North, Louis seemed perfectly contented\r\nwith his new home.\r\n\r\nCamilla was delighted with her tour; the constant companion of her\r\nfather, she visited with him every place of amusement or interest they\r\ncould find. She was much pleased with the factories; and watched with\r\ncurious eyes the intelligent faces of the operatives, as they plied with\r\nready fingers their daily tasks. Sometimes she would contrast their\r\nappearance with the laborers she had seen wending their way into their\r\nlowly huts; and then her face would grow sober even to sadness. A\r\npuzzled expression would flit over her countenance, as if she were\r\ntrying to solve a problem which was inexplicable to her.\r\n\r\nOne day on the hunt for some new excitement, her father passed down\r\nTremont St., and saw advertised, in large letters, on the entrance to\r\nTremont Temple, "Anti Slavery Meeting;" and never having been in such a\r\nplace before he entered, impelled by a natural curiosity to hear what\r\ncould be said against a system in which he had been involved from his\r\nearliest recollections, without taking the pains to examine it.\r\n\r\nThe first speaker was a colored man. This rather surprised him. He had\r\nbeen accustomed to colored men all the days of his life; and as such, he\r\nhad known some of them to be intelligent, shrewd, and wide awake; but\r\nthis was a new experience. The man had been a slave, and recounted in\r\nburning words the wrongs which had been heaped upon him. He told that he\r\nhad been a husband and a father: that his wife had possessed (for a\r\nslave) the "fatal gift of beauty;" that a trader, from whose presence\r\nher soul had recoiled with loathing, had marked her as his prey. Then he\r\ntold how he had knelt at his master\'s feet, and implored him not to sell\r\nher, but it was all in vain. The trader was rich in sin-cursed gold; and\r\nhe was poor and weak. He next attempted to describe his feelings when he\r\nsaw his wife and children standing on the auction block; and heard the\r\ncoarse jests of the spectators, and the fierce competition of the\r\nbidders.\r\n\r\nThe speaker made a deep impression upon the minds of the audience; and\r\neven Le Croix, who had been accustomed to slavery all his life, felt a\r\nsense of guilt passing over him for his complicity in the system; whilst\r\nCamilla grew red and pale by turns, and clutching her little hands\r\nnervously together, said, "Father, let us go home."\r\n\r\nLe Croix saw the deep emotion on his daughter\'s face, and the nervous\r\ntwitchings of her lips, and regretted that he had introduced her to such\r\nan exciting scene.\r\n\r\nWhen they were seated in their private parlor, Le Croix said: "Birdie,\r\nI am sorry that we attended that meeting this morning. I didn\'t believe\r\na word that nigger said; and yet these people all drank it down as if\r\nevery word were gospel truth. They are a set of fanatics, calculated to\r\nkeep the nation in hot water. I hope that you will never enter such a\r\nplace again. Did you believe one word that negro said?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, Pa, I did, because our Isaac used to tell me just such a\r\nstory as that. If I had shut my eyes, I could have imagined that it was\r\nIsaac telling his story."\r\n\r\n"Isaac! What business had Isaac telling you any such stories?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Pa, don\'t get angry with Isaac. It wasn\'t his fault; it was mine.\r\n\r\n"You know when you brought him home to drive the carriage, he used to\r\nlook so sorrowful, and I said to him one day, Isaac, what makes you so\r\nsad? Why don\'t you laugh and talk, like Jerry and Sam?\r\n\r\n"And he said, \'Oh Missus, I can\'t! Ise got a mighty heap of trouble on\r\nmy mind.\' And he looked so down-hearted when he said this, I wanted to\r\nknow what was the matter; but he said, \'It won\'t do, for a little lady\r\nlike you to know the troubles of we poor creatures,\' but one day, when\r\nSam came home from New Orleans he brought him a letter from his wife,\r\nand he really seemed to be overjoyed, and he kissed the letter, and put\r\nit in his bosom, and I never saw him look half so happy before. So the\r\nnext day when I asked him to get the pony ready, he asked me if I\r\nwouldn\'t read it for him. He said he had been trying to make it out, but\r\nsomehow he could not get the hang of the words, and so I sat down and\r\nread it to him. Then he told me about his wife, how beautiful she was;\r\nand how a trader, a real mean man, wanted to buy her, and that he had\r\nbegged his master not to sell her; but it was no use. She had to go; but\r\nhe was glad of one thing; the trader was dead, and his wife had got a\r\nplace in the city with a very nice lady, and he hoped to see her when\r\nhe went to New Orleans. Pa, I wonder how slavery came to be. I should\r\nhate to belong to anybody, wouldn\'t you, Pa?"\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, darling, but then the negroes are contented, and wouldn\'t\r\ntake their freedom, if you would give it to them."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that, Pa; there was Mr. Le Grange\'s Peter. Mr. Le\r\nGrange used to dress him so fine and treat him so well that he thought\r\nno one would ever tempt Peter to leave him; and he came North with him\r\nevery year for three or four summers, and he always made out that he was\r\nafraid of the abolitionists--bobolitionists he used to call them--and\r\nMr. Le Grange just believed that Peter was in earnest, and somehow he\r\ngot Mrs. Le Grange to bring his wife North to wait on her. And when they\r\nboth got here, they both left; and Mrs. Le Grange had to wait on\r\nherself, until she got another servant. She told me she had got enough\r\nof the North, and never wanted to see it again so long as she lived;\r\nthat she wouldn\'t have taken three thousand dollars for them."\r\n\r\n"Well, darling, they would have never left, if these meddlesome\r\nabolitionists hadn\'t put it in their heads; but, darling, don\'t bother\r\nyour brain about such matters. See what I have bought you this morning,"\r\nsaid he, handing her a necklace of the purest pearls; "here, darling, is\r\na birth-day present for you." Camilla took the necklace, and gazing\r\nabsently upon it said, "I can\'t understand it."\r\n\r\n"What is it, my little philosopher, that you can\'t understand?"\r\n\r\n"Pa, I can\'t understand slavery; that man made me think it was something\r\nvery bad. Do you think it can be right?"\r\n\r\nLe Croix\'s face flushed suddenly, and he bit his lip, but said nothing,\r\nand commenced reading the paper.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you answer me, Pa?" Le Croix\'s brow grew darker, but he tried\r\nto conceal his vexation, and quietly said, "Darling, never mind. Don\'t\r\npuzzle your little head about matters you cannot understand, and which\r\nour wisest statesmen cannot solve."\r\n\r\nCamilla said no more, but a new train of thought had been awakened. She\r\nhad lived so much among the slaves, and had heard so many tales of\r\nsorrow breathed confidentially into her ears, that she had unconsciously\r\nimbibed their view of the matter; and without comprehending the\r\ninjustice of the system, she had learned to view it from their\r\nstandpoint of observation.\r\n\r\nWhat she had seen of slavery in the South had awakened her sympathy and\r\ncompassion. What she had heard of it in the North had aroused her sense\r\nof justice. She had seen the old system under a new light. The good seed\r\nwas planted, which was yet to yield its harvest of blessed deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" said St. Pierre Le Grange, as he entered suddenly\r\nthe sitting-room of his wife, Georgietta Le Grange, and saw her cutting\r\noff the curls from the head of little girl about five years old, the\r\nchild of a favorite slave.\r\n\r\n"Matter enough!" said the angry wife, her cheeks red with excitement and\r\nher eyes half blinded with tears of vexation. "This child shan\'t stay\r\nhere; and if she does, she shall never again be taken for mine."\r\n\r\n"Who took her for yours? What has happened that has brought about all\r\nthis excitement?"\r\n\r\n"Just wait a minute," said Georgietta, trying to frame her excitement\r\ninto words.\r\n\r\n"Yesterday I invited the Le Fevres and the Le Counts, and a Northern\r\nlady they had stopping with Mrs. Le Fevre, to dine with us. To-day I\r\ntold Ellen to have the servants all cleaned up, and looking as well as\r\npossible; and so I distributed around more than a dozen turbans, for I\r\nwanted Mrs. King to see how much better and happier our negroes looked\r\nhere than they do when they are free in the North, and what should Ellen\r\ndo but dress up her little minx in her best clothes, and curl her hair\r\nand let her run around in the front yard."\r\n\r\n"So she overdid the thing," said Le Grange, beginning to comprehend the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did, but she will never do it again," exclaimed Mrs. Le\r\nGrange, her dark eyes flashing defiantly.\r\n\r\nLe Grange bit his lip, but said nothing. He saw the storm that was\r\nbrewing, and about to fall on the head of the hapless child and mother,\r\nand thought that he would do nothing to increase it.\r\n\r\n"When Mrs. Le Fevre," continued Georgietta, "alighted from the carriage,\r\nshe noticed the child, and calling the attention of the whole party to\r\nher, said, \'Oh, how beautiful she is! The very image of her father.\'\r\n\'Mrs. Le Grange,\' said she, after passing the compliments of the day, \'I\r\ncongratulate you on having such a beautiful child. She is the very image\r\nof her father. And how large she is for her age.\' Just then Marie came\r\nto the door and said \'She\'s not my sister, that is Ellen\'s child.\' I saw\r\nthe gentlemen exchange glances, and the young ladies screw up their\r\nmouths to hide their merriment, while Mrs. Le Fevre, with all her\r\nobtuseness, seemed to comprehend the blunder, and she said, \'Child, you\r\nmust excuse me, for my poor old eyes are getting so good for nothing I\r\ncan hardly tell one person from the other.\' I blundered some kind of\r\nanswer, I hardly know what I said. I was almost ready to die with\r\nvexation; but this shall never happen again."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?"\r\n\r\n"You see what I have begun to do. I am going to have all this curling\r\nbusiness broken up, and I am going to have her dressed in domestic, like\r\nthe other little niggers. I\'ll let Ellen know that I am mistress here;\r\nand as soon as a trader comes along I mean to sell her. I want a new set\r\nof pearls anyhow."\r\n\r\nLe Grange made no reply. He was fond of the child, but knowing what a\r\ntermagant his wife was, he thought that silence like discretion was the\r\nbetter part of valor, and hastily beat a retreat from her presence.\r\n\r\n"Take these curls and throw them away," said Mrs. Le Grange to Sally,\r\nher waiting-maid. "Move quick, and take this child into the kitchen, and\r\ndon\'t let me see her in the front yard again. Do you hear what I say?"\r\nsaid Georgiette in a sharp, shrill tone. "Don\'t you let me see that\r\nchild in the front yard again. Here, before you go, darken this room,\r\nand let me see if I can get any rest. I am so nervous, I am almost ready\r\nto fly."\r\n\r\nSally did as she was bidden; and taking the child to the kitchen,\r\nexclaimed to Milly, the cook, "Hi! Oh! there\'s been high times upstairs\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said Milly, wiping the dough from her hands, and\r\nturning her face to Sally.\r\n\r\n"Oh! Missus mad \'bout Ellen\'s child. She\'s mad as a March hare. See how\r\nshe\'s cut all her hair off."\r\n\r\n"A debil," said Milly. "What did she do dat for? She is allers up to\r\nsome debilment. What did that poor innercence child do to her? I wonder\r\nwhat she\'ll get at next!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but to-day when Mrs. Le Ferre come\'d here she kissed the\r\nchild, and said it was the very image of its father, and Missus just\r\nlooked mad enough to run her through."\r\n\r\nMilly, in spite of her indignation could not help laughing. "Well,\r\nthat\'s a good joke. I guess Missus\' high as ninety. What did Massa say?"\r\n\r\n"He neber said a word; he looked like he\'d been stealin\' a sheep; and\r\nMissus she jist cut up high, and said she was going to keep her hair cut\r\nshort, and have her dressed in domestic, and kept in the kitchen, and\r\nwhen she got a good chance she meant to sell her, for she wanted a new\r\nset of pearls anyhow. Massa neber said beans. I jist b\'lieve he\'s\r\nfeared of her. She\'s sich a mity piece. I spect some night the debil\r\nwill come and fly way wid her. I hope so anyhow."\r\n\r\nTo which not very pious wish Milly replied, "I am fraid there is no such\r\ngood luck. Nothin\' don\'t s\'prise me that Miss Georgiette does \'cause\r\nshe\'s a chip off the old block. Her mother\'s poor niggers used to be cut\r\nup and slashed all the time; for she was a horse at the mill. De debil\r\nwas in dat woman big as a sheep. Dere was Nancy, my fellow servant;\r\nsomehow she got a spite agin Nancy\'s husban\', said he shouldn\'t come\r\ndere any more. Pore Nancy, her and Andy war libing together in dar nice\r\nlittle cabin, and Nancy did keep ebery ting shinin\' like a new pin,\r\n\'cause she would work so hard when she was done her task for Missus. But\r\none day Missus got de debil in her, and sayed Andy shouldn\'t come der\r\nany more, and she jist had all Nancy\'s tings took out de cabin and shut\r\nit up, and made her come and sleep in de house. Pore Nancy, she cried as\r\nif her heart would break right in two; and she says why does you take my\r\nhusban\' from me? and Missus said I did it to please my own self, and den\r\nNancy kneeled at her feet and said, \'Missus I\'ll get up before day and\r\nset up till twelve or one o\'clock at night and work for you, but please\r\ndon\'t take me from my husban\'. An\' what do you think ole Missus did? Why\r\nshe jist up wid her foot and kicked Nancy in de mouf, and knocked out\r\ntwo of her teef. I seed her do it wid my own blessed eyes. An\' I sed to\r\nmyself de debil will never git his own till he gits you. Well she did\r\nworry dat pore cretur almost to death. She used to make her sleep in the\r\nroom wid her chillen, and locked de door ebery night, and Sundays she\'d\r\nlebe some one to watch her, she was so fraid she\'d git to see her\r\nhusban\'. An\' dis Miss Georgiette is de very moral of her Ma, and she\'s\r\njist as big as a spitfire."\r\n\r\n"Hush," said Milly, "here comes Jane. Don\'t say no more \'bout Missus,\r\ncause she\'s real white people\'s nigger, and tells all she knows, and\r\nwhat she don\'t."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n\r\n"I am really sorry, Ellen, but I can\'t help it. Georgiette has taken a\r\ndislike to the child, and there is no living in peace with her unless I\r\nsell the child or take it away."\r\n\r\n"Oh! Mr. St. Pierre, you would not sell that child when it is your own\r\nflesh and blood?" Le Grange winced under these words.\r\n\r\n"No, Ellen, I\'ll never consent to sell the child, but it won\'t do for\r\nher to stay here. I\'ve made up my mind to send her North, and have her\r\neducated."\r\n\r\n"And then I\'ll never see my darling any more."\r\n\r\n"But, Ellen, that is better than having her here to be knocked around by\r\nGeorgiette, and if I die to be sold as a slave. It is the best thing I\r\ncan do,--hang old Mrs. Le Fevre\'s tongue; but I guess it would have come\r\nout some time or the other. I just tell you what I\'ll do, Ellen. I\'ll\r\ntake the child down to New Orleans, and make out to Georgiette that I am\r\ngoing to sell her, but instead of that, I\'ll get a friend of mine who is\r\ngoing to Pennsylvania to take her with him, and have her boarded there,\r\nand educated. Nobody need know anything about her being colored. I\'d\r\nsend you both, Ellen, but, to tell you the truth, the plantation is\r\nrunning down, and the crops are so short this year I can\'t afford it;\r\nbut when times get better, I\'ll send you up there and tell you where you\r\ncan find her."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mr. St. Pierre, that is better than having Missus knocking her\r\naround or selling her to one of those old mean nigger traders, and never\r\nhaving a chance to see my darling no more. But, Mr. St. Pierre, before\r\nyou take her away won\'t you please give me her likeness? Maybe I won\'t\r\nknow her when I see her again."\r\n\r\nLe Grange consented, and when he went to the city again he told his wife\r\nhe was going to sell the child.\r\n\r\n"I am glad of it," said Georgiette. "I would have her mother sold, but\r\nwe can\'t spare her; she is so handy with her needle, and does all the\r\ncutting out on the place."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLe Grange\'s Plan\r\n\r\n\r\n"The whole fact is this Joe, I am in an awkward fix. I have got myself\r\ninto a scrape, and I want you to help me out of it. You were good at\r\nsuch things when we were at College, and I want you to try your hand\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s the difficulty now?"\r\n\r\n"Well, it is rather a serious one. I have got a child on my hands, and I\r\ndon\'t know what to do with it."\r\n\r\n"Whose child is it?"\r\n\r\n"Now, that\'s just where the difficulty lies. It is the child of one of\r\nmy girls, but it looks so much like me, that my wife don\'t want it on\r\nthe place. I am too hard up just now to take the child and her mother,\r\nNorth, and take care of them there. And to tell you the truth I am too\r\nhumane to have the child sold here as a slave. Now in a word do you\r\nthink that among your Abolitionist friends in the North you could find\r\nany one who would raise the child and bring it up like a white child."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know about that St. Pierre. There are a number of our people in\r\nthe North, who do two things. They hate slavery and hate negroes. They\r\nfeel like the woman who in writing to her husband said, they say (or\r\ndon\'t say) that absence conquers love; for the longer you stay away the\r\nbetter I love you. But then I know some who, I believe, are really\r\nsincere, and who would do anything to help the colored people. I think I\r\nknow two or three families who would be willing to take the child, and\r\ndo a good part by her. If you say so, I will write to a friend whom I\r\nhave now in mind, and if they will consent I will take the child with me\r\nwhen I go North, provided I can do it without having it discovered that\r\nshe is colored, for it would put me in an awkward fix to have it known\r\nthat I took a colored child away with me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never fear," said St. Pierre, slapping his friend on the shoulder.\r\n"The child is whiter than you are, and you know you can pass for white."\r\n\r\nTrue to his promise, Josiah Collins wrote to a Quaker friend, whom he\r\nknew in Pennsylvania, and told him the particulars of the child\'s\r\nhistory, and the wishes of her father, and the compensation he would\r\ngive. In a few days he received a favorable response in which the friend\r\ntold him he was glad to have the privilege of rescuing one of that fated\r\nrace from a doom more cruel than the grave; that the compensation was no\r\nobject; that they had lost their only child, and hoped that she would in\r\na measure fill the void in their hearts.\r\n\r\nHighly gratified with the kind letter of the friend, Le Grange gave the\r\nchild into the charge of Josiah Collins, and putting a check for five\r\nhundred dollars in his hand, parted with them at the [station].\r\n\r\nHe went back into the country, and told his wife that he had found a\r\ntrader, who thought the child so beautiful, and that he had bought her\r\nto raise as a fancy girl, and had given him five hundred dollars for\r\nher. "And here," said he, handing her a set of beautiful pearls, "is my\r\npeace offering."\r\n\r\nGeorgette\'s eyes glistened as she entertwined the pearls amid the wealth\r\nof her raven hair, and clasped them upon her beautifully rounded arms.\r\n\r\nWhat mattered it to her if every jewel cost a heart throb, and if the\r\nwhole set were bought with the price of blood? They suited her style of\r\nbeauty, and she cared not what they cost. Proud, imperious, and selfish,\r\nshe knew no law but her own will; no gratification but the enjoyment of\r\nher own desires.\r\n\r\nPassing from the boudoir of his wife, he sought the room where Ellen\r\nsat, busily cutting and arranging the clothing for the field hands, and\r\ngazing furtively around he said, "here is Minnie\'s likeness. I have\r\nmanaged all right." "Thank Heaven!" said the sad hearted mother, as she\r\npaused to dry her tears, and then resumed her needle. "Anything is\r\nbetter--than Slavery."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed any further with my story, let me tell the reader\r\nsomething of the Le Granges, whom I have so unceremoniously introduced.\r\n\r\nLe Grange, like Le Croix, was of French and Spanish descent, and his\r\nfather had also been a Haytian refugee. But there the similitude ends;\r\nunlike Le Croix, he had grown up a gay and reckless young man, fond of\r\nsports, and living an aimless life.\r\n\r\nHis father had on his plantation a beautiful quadroon girl, named Ellen,\r\nwhom he had bought in Richmond because she begged him to buy her when he\r\nhad bought her mother, who had been recommended to him as a first-rate\r\ncook. They had been servants in what was called one of the first\r\nfamilies of Virginia, and had been treated by their mistress with more\r\nkindness and consideration than generally fell to the lot of persons in\r\ntheir condition. As long as she lived, they had been well fed and well\r\nclothed, and except the deprivation of their freedom, had known but few\r\nof the hardships so incident to slave life; but a reverse had fallen\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nTheir mistress had intended to set them free, but, dying suddenly, she\r\nhad failed to carry out her intention. Her property fell into the hands\r\nof distant heirs, who sold it all, and divided it among themselves.\r\nEllen and her mother were put up at auction, when a kindly looking old\r\nFrenchman bought the mother. Ellen stood trembling by; but, when she saw\r\nher mother\'s new master, she started forth, and kneeling at his feet,\r\nshe begged him to buy her. The mother joined in and said, "Do, Massa,\r\nand I\'ll serve you faithful day and night; there is a heap of work in\r\nthese old bones yet."\r\n\r\nMr. Le Grange told her to be quiet, and he would buy her. And, true to\r\nhis word, although the bidding ran high, and the competition was fierce,\r\nhe bought her; and the next day, he started with them for his plantation\r\non Red River.\r\n\r\nHis son, Louis, had just graduated, and was spending the winter at home,\r\nin just that mood of which it is said that Satan finds some mischief for\r\nidle hands to do. Milly, who knew the wiles of the world better than\r\nEllen, tried to keep her as much as possible out of his way; but her\r\ncaution was all in vain. She saw her child engulfed, as thousands of her\r\nrace had been.\r\n\r\nMrs. Le Grange, when she became apprised of the condition of things,\r\ngrew very angry; but, instead of venting her indignation upon the head\r\nof her offending son, she poured out the vials of her wrath upon the\r\ndefenseless girl. She made up her mind to sell her off the place, and\r\npicked the opportunity, while her son was absent, to send her to a\r\ntrader\'s pen in the city. When Louis came home, he found Milly looking\r\nvery sullen and distressed, and her eyes red with weeping.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" said Louis.\r\n\r\n"Matter enough," said Milly. "Missus done gone and sold Ellen."\r\n\r\n"Sold Ellen! Why, how did that happen?"\r\n\r\n"Why, she found out all about her, and said she should not stay on the\r\nplace another day, and so she sent her down to Orleans to the nigger\r\ntraders, and my heart\'s most broke," and Milly sat down, wiping her\r\ntears with her apron.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Milly," said Louis, "I\'ll go down to New Orleans and bring\r\nher back. Mother sha\'n\'t do as she pleases with me, as if I were a boy,\r\nand must always be tied to her apron string. I\'ve got some money of my\r\nown, and I mean to find Ellen if I have to look all over the country."\r\n\r\nHe entered the dining room, and saw his mother seated at the tea table,\r\nlooking as bland and pleasant as a Spring morning, and asked, "Where is\r\nEllen?"\r\n\r\nThe smile died from her lips, and she answered, curtly, "She is out of\r\n_your_ reach [?]. I\'ve sold her."\r\n\r\n"But where have you sold her?"\r\n\r\n"Out of your reach, and that is all I am going to tell you."\r\n\r\nLouis, without saying another word went out to the coachman, and asked\r\nwhat time the cars left the station.\r\n\r\n"Ten minutes to nine."\r\n\r\n"Can you take me there in time to reach the train? I want to go to the\r\ncity tonight."\r\n\r\n"Dunno, massa; my best horse is lame, and what----"\r\n\r\n"Never mind your excuse; here," said he, throwing him a dollar, "hitch\r\nup as quick as possible, and take me there without any \'buts\' or \'ifs.\'"\r\n\r\n"All right, massa," said Sam, grinning with delight. "I\'ll have you over\r\nthere in short order."\r\n\r\nThe carriage harnessed, Samuel found no difficulty with his horses, and\r\nreached the depot almost a half hour before the time.\r\n\r\nLouis arrived in the city after midnight, and the next day he devoted to\r\nhunting for Ellen. He searched through different slave pens, inquired of\r\nall the traders, until at last, ready to abandon his search in\r\nhopelessness, he heard of a private jail in the suburbs of the city.\r\nNothing daunted by his failure, he found the place and Ellen also.\r\n\r\nThe trader eyed him keenly, and saw from his manner that he was in\r\nearnest about having the girl.\r\n\r\n"She is not for sale in this city. Whoever buys her must give me a\r\npledge to take her out of this city. That was the bargain I made with\r\nher mistress. She made me promise her that I would sell her to no one in\r\nthe vicinity of the city. In fact, she wanted me to sell her out of the\r\nway of her son. His mother said she had dedicated him to the Blessed\r\nVirgin, and I reckon she wanted to keep him out of the way of\r\ntemptation. Now what will you give me for her?"\r\n\r\n"Will you take a thousand for her?"\r\n\r\n"Now you ain\'t saying nothing," said the trader, shutting one eye, and\r\nspitting on the floor.\r\n\r\n"How will twelve hundred do?"\r\n\r\n"It won\'t do at all, not for such a fancy article as that. I\'d rather\r\nkeep her for myself than sell her at such a low figure. Why, just look\r\nat her! Why, she\'s pretty as a picture! Look at that neck, and her\r\nshoulders. See how she carries her head! And look at that splendid head\r\nof hair. Why some of our nabobs would give three thousand dollars; but\r\nI\'ll tell you what I\'ll do, I\'ll let you have her for two thousand\r\ndollars; fancy article is cheap at that."\r\n\r\nLouis demurred, but the trader was inexorable, and rather than let the\r\nopportunity to rescue Ellen from him escape he paid the exorbitant\r\nprice, and had her brought to his hotel. His next work was to get a\r\nhouse for Ellen, and have her taken there, installed as his mistress. He\r\nthen went back to the plantation as if nothing had happened, and his\r\nmother soon thought he was reconciled about the loss of Ellen. Only\r\nMilly knew his secret, and she kept it as a secret thing.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got some pleasant news for you, Louis," said Mrs. Le Grange, one\r\nday to her son: "your uncle and cousin are coming down from Virginia,\r\nand I want you to be all attention to your cousin, for she is very rich.\r\nShe has a fortune in her right, which was left her by her grandmother,\r\nand besides she will have another one at her father\'s death, added, to\r\nwhich they say, she is a very beautiful girl."\r\n\r\nGreat preparations were made for the expected guests. Georgiette was\r\nMrs. Le Grange\'s brother\'s child, and having been separated from him\r\nfor more than fifteen years she was full of joyful anticipations, when\r\nhe apprised her of his intention of visiting her in company with his\r\ndaughter. At length the welcome day arrived, and Mrs. Le Grange stood\r\narranging her jewels and ribbons to receive the guests.\r\n\r\n"You are welcome to Louisiana," said she, removing Georgiette\'s shawl,\r\nand tenderly kissing her, "and you too, brother," she said, as Mr.\r\nMonteith followed his daughter. "How beautiful Georgiette has grown\r\nsince I saw her. Why darling you look charming! I\'m afraid I shan\'t be\r\nable to keep you long for some of the beaux will surely run away with\r\nyou." "My son," said Mrs. Le Grange, introducing Louis, who just then\r\nentered the door.\r\n\r\nLouis bowed very low, and expressed his pleasure in seeing them; and\r\nhoped they would have a happy time, and that nothing should be wanting\r\non his part, to make it so. Very pleasantly passed the time away;\r\nGeorgiette was in high and charming spirits; and many a pleasant ride\r\nand delightful saunter she took with her cousin through the woods, or in\r\nvisiting other plantations. She was very popular among the planters\'\r\nsons; admired by the young men, but feared and envied by the girls.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the hours passed in a whirl of pleasurable excitement, until\r\nLouis actually imagined himself in love with her, and found himself one\r\npleasant afternoon offering her his hand and heart.\r\n\r\nShe blushed and sighed, and referred him to her papa; and in a few weeks\r\nthey were engaged.\r\n\r\nAt length the time of their departure came; and Louis, after\r\naccompanying them to New Orleans, returned to make ready for the\r\nwedding. His father made him a present of a large plantation, which he\r\nstocked from his own purse, with three hundred slaves; and installed\r\nEllen there as housekeeper till the arrival of the new mistress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n\r\n"Thee is welcome to S.," said the cheerful voice of Thomas Carpenter, as\r\nJosiah Collins alighted, bringing with him his charge; "and is this the\r\nlittle child thee wrote me about? I am heartily glad thee has rescued\r\nher from that dreadful system!"\r\n\r\n"Anna," said he, turning to his wife, who had just entered the room,\r\n"here is our friend, Josiah Collins, and the little girl I told thee\r\nabout."\r\n\r\n"I am glad thee has come," said Anna, "sit down and make thyself at\r\nhome. And this is the little girl thee wrote Thomas about. She is a\r\nbeautiful child," continued Anna, gazing admiringly at the child. "I\r\nhope she will be contented. Does she fret about her mother?"\r\n\r\n"Not much; she would sometimes ask, \'where is mamma?\' But the ladies in\r\nthe cars were very kind to her, and she was quite at home with them. I\r\ntold them I was taking her North; that I thought the North would better\r\nagree with her; and that it was not convenient for her mother to come on\r\njust now. I was really amused with the attention she received from the\r\nSouthern ladies; knowing how they would have shrunk from such offices if\r\nthey had known that one drop of the outcast blood ran in her veins."\r\n\r\n"Why, Josiah," said Anna, "I have always heard that there was more\r\nprejudice against the colored people in the North than in the South.\r\nThere is a difference in the manifestations of this feeling, but I do\r\nnot think there is as much prejudice here as there. [Here?] we have a\r\nprejudice which is [formed from?] traditional ideas. We see in many\r\nparts of the North a very few of the colored people, and our impressions\r\nof them have received their coloring more or less from what the\r\nslaveholders have said of them."\r\n\r\n"We have been taught that they are idle, improvident, and unfitted for\r\nfreedom, and incapable of progression; and when we see them in the\r\ncities we see them overshadowed by wealth, enterprise, and activity, so\r\nthat our unfavorable impressions are too often confirmed. Still if one\r\nof that class rises above this low mental condition, we know that there\r\nare many who are willing to give such a one a healthy recognition."\r\n\r\n"I know that there are those that have great obstacles to overcome, but\r\nI think that while Southerners may have more personal likings for\r\ncertain favorite servants, they have stronger prejudices than even we\r\nhave, or if they have no more than we have, they have more\r\nself-restraint, and show it more virulently."\r\n\r\n"But I [think?] they do not seem to have any horror of personal\r\ncontact."\r\n\r\n"Of course not; constant familiarity with the race has worn away all\r\nsense of physical repulsion but there is a prejudice which ought to be\r\nan American feeling; it is a prejudice against their rising in the scale\r\nof humanity. A prejudice which virtually says you are down, and I mean\r\nto keep you down. As a servant I tolerate you; you are useful as you are\r\nvaluable, but rise one step in the scale of being, and I am ready to put\r\nyou down. I see this in the treatment that the free colored people\r\nreceive in parts of the South; they seem to me to be the outcasts of an\r\noutcast race. They are denied the right to walk in certain public places\r\naccessible to every class unless they go as nurses, and are forbidden to\r\nassemble in evening meetings, and forced to be in the house unless they\r\nhave passes, by an early hour in the night, and in fact they are\r\nhampered or hemmed in on every side; subject to insults from any rude,\r\ncoarse or brutal white, and in case of outrages, denied their testimony.\r\nPrejudiced as we are in Pennsylvania, we do not go that far."\r\n\r\n"But, Josiah, we have much to blush for in Pennsylvania; colored people\r\nare denied the privilege of riding in our street cars. Only last week\r\nwhen I was in Philadelphia I saw a very decent-looking colored woman\r\nwith a child, who looked too feeble to walk, and the child too heavy for\r\nher to carry. She beckoned to a conductor, but he swept by and took no\r\nmore heed of her than if she had been a dog. There was a young lady\r\nsitting in the car, who remarked to her mother, as a very filthy-looking\r\nwhite man entered, \'See, they will let that filthy creature ride and\r\nprohibit a decent respectable colored person!\' The mother quietly\r\nassented.\r\n\r\n"From her dress I took her to be a Quakeress, for she had a lovely dress\r\nof dove-colored silk. The young lady had scarcely uttered the words when\r\na young man who sat next the mother deliberately arose, and beckoned to\r\nthe man with the sooty clothes to take his seat; but fortunately for the\r\nQuakeress, a lady who was sitting next her daughter arose just at that\r\nmoment, and left the seat, and the old man without noticing the\r\nmanoeuvre passed over to the other side, and thus avoided the contact. I\r\nwas amused, however, about one thing; for the young man who gave up his\r\nseat was compelled to ride about a mile standing."\r\n\r\n"Served him right," said Thomas Carpenter; "it was a very contemptible\r\naction, to attempt to punish the hardihood of the young lady by\r\nattempting to soil her mother\'s dress; and yet little souls who feel a\r\nmorbid satisfaction in trampling on the weak, always sink themselves in\r\nthe scale of manhood."\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, the tea bell rang, and Josiah and\r\nhis little charge sat down to a well supplied table; for the Friends,\r\nthough plain and economical, are no enemies to good living.\r\n\r\nAnna had brought the high-chair in which their own darling had sat a few\r\nmonths before, when she had made gladness and sunshine around her\r\nparent\'s path.\r\n\r\nThere was a tender light in the eye of the Quakeress as she dusted the\r\nchair, and sat Minnie at the table.\r\n\r\n"Do you think," said Thomas, addressing Josiah, "that we will ever\r\noutgrow this wicked, miserable prejudice?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, but it must be the work of time. Both races have their work to\r\ndo. The colored man must outgrow his old condition of things, and thus\r\ncreate around him a new class of associations. This generation has known\r\nhim as a being landless, poor, and ignorant. One of the most important\r\nthings for him to do is to acquire land. He will never gain his full\r\nmeasure of strength until (like Anteus) he touches the earth. And I think\r\nhere is the great fault, or misfortune of the race; they seem to me to\r\nreadily accept their situation, and not to let their industrial aspirations\r\nrise high enough. I wish they had more of the earth hunger that\r\ncharacterizes the German, or the concentration of purpose which we see\r\nin the Jews."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Thomas, "that the Jews and Negroes have one thing in\r\ncommon, and that is their power of endurance. They, like the negro, have\r\nlived upon an idea, and that is the hope of a deliverer yet to come; but\r\nI think this characteristic more strongly developed in the Jews than in\r\nthe Negroes."\r\n\r\n"Doubtless it is, but their origin and history have been different. The\r\nJews have a common ancestry and grand traditions, that have left alive\r\ntheir pride of race. \'We have Abraham to our father,\' they said, when\r\ntheir necks were bowed beneath the Roman yoke."\r\n\r\n"But I do not think the negro can trace with certainty his origin back\r\nto any of the older civilizations, and here for more than two hundred\r\nyears his history has been a record of blood and tears, of ignorance,\r\ndegradation, and slavery. And when nominally free, prejudice has\r\nassigned him the lowest positions and the humblest situations. I have\r\nnot much hope of their progress while they are enslaved in the South."\r\n\r\n"Well, Josiah, I have faith enough in the ultimate triumph of our\r\nprinciples to believe that slavery will bite the dust before long."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, friend Carpenter; for the system is very strongly rooted\r\nand grounded in the institutions of the land, and has entrenched itself\r\nin the strongholds of Church and State, fashion, custom, and social\r\nlife. And yet when I was in the South, I saw on every hand a growing\r\ndifferentiation towards the Government."\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Josiah, that I have more hope from the madness and folly\r\nof the South than I have from the wisdom and virtue of the North? I have\r\nread too \'whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n\r\nTen years have elapsed since Minnie came to brighten the home of Thomas\r\nCarpenter, and although within the heart of Anna there is a spot forever\r\ngreen and sacred to the memory of her only child, yet Minnie holds an\r\nundivided place in their affections.\r\n\r\nThere is only one subject which is to them a source of concern. It is\r\nthe connection of Minnie with the colored race. Not that they love her\r\nless on account of the blood that is in her veins, but they dread the\r\neffect its discovery would have upon the pleasant social circle with\r\nwhich she is surrounded, and also the fear that the revelation would be\r\npainful to her.\r\n\r\nThey know that she is Anti-Slavery in her principles. They have been\r\ncareful to instil into her young mind a reverence for humanity, and to\r\nrecognize beneath all externals, whether of condition or color, the\r\nhuman soul all written over with the handmarks of divinity and the\r\ncommon claims of humanity.\r\n\r\nShe has known for years that their home has been one of the stations of\r\nthe underground railroad. And the Anti-Slavery lecturer, whether white\r\nor colored, has always been among the welcomed guests of her home. Still\r\nthey shrink from the effect the knowledge would have on her mind. They\r\nknow she is willing to work for the colored race; but they could not\r\ndivine what it cost her to work with them.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me, Anna, that we ought to reveal to Minnie the fact of her\r\nconnection with the colored race. I am afraid that she will learn in\r\nsome way that will rudely shock her; whereas we might break it to her\r\nin the tenderest manner. Every time a fugitive comes I dread that our\r\ndarling will be recognized."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Thomas; thy fears have made thee over sensitive. Who would imagine\r\nhe saw in this bright and radiant girl of fifteen the little\r\nfive-year-old child we took to our hearts and home? I never feel any\r\ndifference between her and the whitest child in the village as far as\r\nprejudice is concerned. And if every body in the village knew her origin\r\nI would love her just as much as I ever did, for she is a dear good\r\nchild."\r\n\r\n"Well, dear, if you think it is best to keep it a secret, I will not\r\ninterfere. But we must not forget that Minnie will soon be a young lady;\r\nthat she is very beautiful, and even now she begins to attract\r\nadmiration. I do not think it would be right for us to let her marry a\r\nwhite man without letting her know the prejudices of society, and giving\r\nher a chance to explain to him the conditions of things."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Anna, "that is true; I have heard that traces of that blood\r\nwill sometimes reappear even in grandchildren, when it has not been\r\ndetected in the first. And to guard against difficulty which might arise\r\nfrom such a course, I think it is better to apprise her of the facts in\r\nthe case."\r\n\r\n"It is time enough for that. I want her to finish her education before\r\nshe thinks of marrying, and I am getting her ready to go to\r\nPhiladelphia, where she will find an excellent school as I have heard it\r\nvery highly spoken of. She is young and happy, trouble will come time\r\nenough, let me not hasten its advent."\r\n\r\nBut if time has only strewed the path of Minnie with flowers, and\r\nripened the promised beauty of her childhood, it has borne a heavy hand\r\nupon the destiny of the La Croix family.\r\n\r\nLa Croix is dead; but before his death he took the precaution to have\r\nLouis emancipated, and then made him a joint heir with his daughter. The\r\nwill he entrusted to the care of Camilla; but the deed of emancipation\r\nhe placed in the hands of Miriam, saying, "Here are your free papers,\r\nand here are Louis\'. There is nothing in this world sure but death; and\r\nit is well to be on the safe side. Some one might be curious enough to\r\nsearch out his history; and if there should be no legal claim to his\r\nfreedom, he might be robbed of both his liberty and his inheritance; so\r\nkeep these papers, and if ever the hour comes when you or he should need\r\nthem, you must show me."\r\n\r\nMiriam did as she was bidden; but her heart was lighter when she knew\r\nthat freedom had come so near her and Louis.\r\n\r\nLe Croix, before his death, had sold the greater part of his slaves, and\r\ninvested the money in Northern bonds and good Northern securities.\r\nCamilla had married a gentleman from the North, and is living very\r\nhappily upon the old plantation. She does not keep an overseer, and\r\ntries to do all in her power to ameliorate the condition of her slaves;\r\nstill she is not satisfied with the system, and is trying to prepare her\r\nslaves for freedom, by inducing them to form, as much as possible,\r\nhabits of self-reliance, and self-restraint, which they will need in the\r\nfreedom which she has determined they shall enjoy as soon as she can\r\narrange her affairs to that effect. But she also has to proceed with a\r\ngreat deal of caution.\r\n\r\nThe South is in a state of agitation and [foment?]. The air is laden\r\nwith rumors of a [rising?] conflict between the North and the South, and\r\nany want of allegiance to Southern opinions is punished either as a\r\ncrime if the offender is a man, or with social ostracism and insult if a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe South in the palmy days of her pride and power would never tolerate\r\nany heresy to her creed, whose formula of statement might have been\r\nwritten we believe in the divine right of the Master, to take advantage\r\nof the weakness, ignorance, and poverty of the slave; that might makes\r\nright, and that success belongs to the strongest arm.[1]\r\n\r\nSome of her former friends were beginning to eye her with coldness and\r\nsuspicion because she would not join in their fanatical hatred of the\r\nNorth and because she would profess her devotion to the old flag, while\r\nthey were ready to spit upon and trample it under foot.\r\n\r\nHer adopted brother was still in the North, and strange to say he did\r\nnot share her feelings; his sympathies were with the South, and although\r\nhe was too young to take any leading part in the events there about to\r\ntranspire, yet year after year when he spent his vacations at home, he\r\nattended the hustings and political meetings, and there he learned to\r\nconsider the sentiment, "My country right or wrong," as a proper maxim\r\nfor political action.\r\n\r\nThis difference in their sentiments did not produce the least\r\nestrangement between them; only Camilla regretted to see Louis ready to\r\nraise his hand against the freedom of his mother\'s race, although he was\r\nperfectly unconscious of his connection with it, for the conflict which\r\nwas then brewing between the North and the South was in fact a struggle\r\nbetween despotism and idea; between freedom on one side and slavery on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"Commencement over, what are you going to do with yourself?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; loaf around, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you go to Newport?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t want to; got tired of it last year."\r\n\r\n"Saratoga?"\r\n\r\n"A perfect bore!"\r\n\r\n"Niagara?"\r\n\r\n"Been there twice."\r\n\r\n"A pedestrian tour to the White Mountains?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t got energy enough."\r\n\r\n"What will you do?"\r\n\r\n"Stay at home and fight mosquitoes."\r\n\r\n"Very pleasant employment. I don\'t envy you, but I can tell you\r\nsomething better than that."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" said his companion, yawning.\r\n\r\n"Come, go home with me."\r\n\r\n"Go home with you! Where is that, and what is the attraction?"\r\n\r\n"Well, let me see, it is situated in one of the most beautiful valleys\r\nof Western Pennsylvania, our village is environed by the most lovely\r\nhills, and nestling among the trees, with its simple churches and\r\nunpretending homes of quiet beauty and good taste, it is one of the most\r\npleasant and picturesque places I ever saw. And, besides, as you love to\r\nhunt and fish, we have one of the finest streams of trout, and some of\r\nthe most excellent game in the woods."\r\n\r\n"Is that all?"\r\n\r\n"Why, isn\'t that enough? You must be rather hard to please this\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Think so?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but I have not told you the crowning attraction."\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, one of the most beautiful girls I ever saw! We call her the lily of\r\nthe valley."\r\n\r\n"Describe her."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t. It would be like attempting to paint a sun beam or doing what\r\nno painter has ever done, sketch a rainbow."\r\n\r\n"You are very poetical this morning, but I want you to do as our\r\nPresident sometimes tells us, proceed from the abstract to the\r\nconcrete."\r\n\r\n"Well, let me begin: she has the most beautiful little feet. I never see\r\nher stepping along without thinking of Cinderella and the glass slipper.\r\nAs to eyes, they are either dark brown or black, I don\'t know which; but\r\nI do know they are beautiful; and her hair, well, she generally wears\r\nthat plain in deference to the wishes of her Quaker friends, but\r\nsometimes in the most beautiful ripples of golden brown I ever saw."\r\n\r\n"That will do, now tell me who she is? You spoke of her Quaker friends.\r\nIs she not their daughter?"\r\n\r\n"No, there seems to be some mystery about her history. About ten years\r\nago, my father brought her to Josiah Carpenter\'s but he\'s always been\r\nreticent about her, in fact I never took the pains to inquire. She\'s a\r\ngreat favorite in the village, and everybody says she is as beautiful as\r\nshe is good, and vice versa."\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'d like to see this paragon of yours. I believe I\'ll go."\r\n\r\n"Well, let us get ready."\r\n\r\n"When do you start?"\r\n\r\n"To-morrow."\r\n\r\n"All right. I\'ll be on hand." And with these words the two friends\r\nparted to meet again the next day at the railroad station.\r\n\r\nThe first of the speakers is the son of Josiah Collins, and his friend\r\nis Louis Le Croix, Camilla\'s adopted brother. He is somewhat changed\r\nwithin the last ten years. Time has touched the golden wealth of his\r\ncurls with a beautiful deep auburn, and the rich full tones of his voice\r\ntell that departed is written upon his childhood.\r\n\r\nHe is strongly Southern in his feelings, but having been educated in the\r\nNorth, whilst he is an enthusiast in defense of his section, as he calls\r\nthe South, he is neither coarse and brutal in actions, nor fanatical in\r\nhis devotion to slavery. He thinks the Negroes are doing well enough in\r\nslavery, if the Abolitionists would only let matters rest, and he feels\r\na sense of honor in defending the South. She is his mother, he says, and\r\nthat man is an ingrate who will not stand by his mother and defend her\r\nwhen she is in peril.\r\n\r\nHe and Charles Collins are fast friends, but [on the subject of slavery\r\nthey are entirely opposed?]. And so on that point they have agreed to\r\ndisagree. They often have animated and exciting discussions, but they\r\n[pass?] and Josiah and Louis are just as friendly as they were before.\r\n\r\nThere were two arrivals the next evening in the [quiet?] village of S.\r\nOne was Charles Collins, the other his Southern friend, who was received\r\nwith the warmest welcome, and soon found himself at home in the pleasant\r\nsociety of his friend\'s family. The evening was enlivened with social\r\nchat and music, until ten o\'clock, when Josiah gathered his children and\r\nhaving read the Bible in a deeply impressive manner, breathed one of the\r\nmost simple and fervent prayers he had ever heard.\r\n\r\nWhile they were bending at prayer in this pleasant home, a shabby\r\nlooking man came walking slowly and wearily into the village. He gazed\r\ncautiously around and looked anxiously in the street as though he were\r\nlooking for some one, but did not like to trust his business to every\r\none.\r\n\r\nAt length he saw an elderly man, dressed in plain clothes, and a broad\r\nbrim hat, and drawing near he spoke to him in a low and hesitating\r\nvoice, and asked if he knew a Mr. Thomas Carpenter.\r\n\r\n"My name is Carpenter," said the friend, "come with me."\r\n\r\nThere was something in the voice, and manner of the friend that\r\n_assured_ the stranger. His whole manner changed. A peaceful expression\r\nstole over his dark, sad face, and the drooping limbs seemed to be\r\naroused by a new infusion of energy.\r\n\r\n"Come in," said Thomas, as he reached his door, "come in, thee\'s welcome\r\nto stop and rest with us."\r\n\r\n"Anna," said Thomas,[2] his face beaming with kindness, "I\'ve brought\r\nthee a guest. Here is another passenger by the Underground Railroad."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure thee\'s welcome," said Anna, handing him a chair, "sit down,\r\nthee looks very tired. Where did thee come from?"\r\n\r\nMoses, that was the fugitive\'s name, hesitated a moment.\r\n\r\n"Oh, never fear, thee\'s among friends; thee need not be afraid to tell\r\nall about thyself."\r\n\r\nMoses then told them that he had come from Kentucky.\r\n\r\n"And how did thee escape?"\r\n\r\nHe said, "I walked from Lexington to Covington."\r\n\r\n"Why, that was almost one hundred miles, and did thee walk all that\r\nway?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said he, "I hid by day, and walked by night."\r\n\r\n"Did no one interrupt?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, one man said to me, \'Where\'s your pass?\' I suppose I must have\r\ngrown desperate, for I raised my fists and said dem\'s my passes; and he\r\nlet me alone. I don\'t know whether he was friendly or scared, but he let\r\nme alone."\r\n\r\n"And how then?"\r\n\r\n"When I come to Covington I found that I could not come across the river\r\nwithout a pass, but I watched my chance, and hid myself on a boat, and I\r\ngot across. I\'d heard of you down home."\r\n\r\n"How did you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'s got some few friends dere, but we allers promise not to tell."\r\n\r\nAnna and Thomas[3] smiled at his reticence, which had grown into a\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\n"Were you badly treated?"\r\n\r\n"Not so bad as some, but I allers wanted my freedom, I did."\r\n\r\n"Well, we will not talk about thee any more; if thee walked all that\r\ndistance thee must be very tired and we\'ll let thee rest. There\'s thy\r\nbed. I hope thee\'ll have a good night\'s rest, and feel better in the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"Thankee marm," said Moses, "you\'s mighty good."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, but I always like to do my duty by my fellow men! Now, be quiet,\r\nand get a good night\'s sleep. Thee looks excited. Thee mustn\'t be\r\nuneasy. Thee\'s among friends."\r\n\r\nA flood of emotions crept over the bosom of Moses when his kind friends\r\nleft the room. Was this freedom, and was this the long wished for North?\r\nand were these the Abolitionists of whom he had heard so much in the\r\nSouth? They who would allure the colored people from their homes in the\r\nSouth and then leave them to freeze and starve in the North? He had\r\nheard all his life that the slaveholders were the friends of the South,\r\nand the language of his soul had been, "If these are my friends, save me\r\nfrom my foes." He had lived all his life among the white people of the\r\nSouth, and had been owned by several masters, but he did not know that\r\nthere was so much kindness among the white race, till he had rested in a\r\nNorthern home, and among Northern people.\r\n\r\nHere kindness encouraged his path, and in that peaceful home every voice\r\nthat fell upon his ear was full of tenderness and sympathy. True, there\r\nwere rough, coarse, brutal men even in that village, who for a few\r\ndollars or to prove their devotion to the South, would have readily\r\nremanded him to his master, but he was not aware of that. And so when he\r\nsank to his rest a sense of peace and safety stole over him, and his\r\nsleep was as calm and peaceful as the slumber of a child.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he looked refreshed, but still his strength was wasted\r\nby his great physical exertion and mental excitement; and Thomas[4]\r\nthought he had better rest a few days till he grew stronger and better\r\nprepared to travel; for Thomas[5] noticed that he was nervous, starting\r\nat the sound of every noise, and often turning his head to the door with\r\nan anxious, frightened look.\r\n\r\nThomas would have gladly given him shelter and work, and given him just\r\nwages, but he dared not do so. He was an American citizen it is true,\r\nbut at that time slavery reigned over the North and ruled over the\r\nSouth, and he had not the power under the law of the land to give\r\ndomicile, and break his bread to that poor, hunted and flying man; for\r\neven then they were hunting in the South and sending out their human\r\nbloodhounds to search for him in the North.\r\n\r\nThroughout the length and breadth of the land, from the summit of the\r\nrainbow-crowned Niagara to the swollen waters of the Mexican Gulf; from\r\nthe golden gates of sunrise to the gorgeous portals of departing day,\r\nthere was not a hill so high, a forest so secluded, a glen so\r\nsequestered, nor mountain so steep, that he knew he could not be tracked\r\nand hailed in the name of the general government.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the news, friend Carpenter? any new arrivals?" said Josiah\r\nCollins in a low voice to Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a very interesting case; can\'t you come over?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, after breakfast. By the way, you must be a little more cautious\r\nthan usual. Charley came home last night, and brought a young friend\r\nwith him from college. I think from his conversation that he is either a\r\nSoutherner himself, or in deep sympathy with the South."\r\n\r\nBoth men spoke in low tones, for although they were Northerners, they\r\nwere talking about a subject on which they were compelled to speak with\r\nbated breaths.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Josiah came over, but Moses seemed so heavy and over\r\nwearied that they did not care to disturb him. There was a look of\r\ndejection and intense sadness on the thin worn face, and a hungry look\r\nin the mournful eyes, as if his soul had been starving for kindness and\r\nsympathy. Sometimes he would forget his situation, and speak hopefully\r\nof the future, but still there was a weariness that he could not shake\r\noff, a languor that seemed to pervade every nerve and muscle.\r\n\r\nThomas thought it was the natural reaction of the deep excitement,\r\nthrough which he just passed, that the tension of his nerves had been\r\ntoo great, but that a few days rest and quiet would restore him to his\r\nnormal condition; but that hope soon died away.\r\n\r\nThe tension, excitement, and consequent exhaustion had been too much.\r\nReason tottered on its throne, and he became a raving maniac; in his\r\nmoments of delirium he would imagine that he was escaping from slavery;\r\nthat the pursuers were upon his back; that they had caught him, and were\r\nrebinding him about to take him back to slavery, and then it was\r\nheartrending to hear him beg, and plead to be carried to Thomas\r\nCarpenter\'s.\r\n\r\nHe would reach out his emaciated hands, and say "Carry me to Mr.\r\nCarpenter\'s, that good man\'s house," for that name which had become more\r\nprecious to him than a household to his soul, still lingered amid\r\nshattered cells. But the delirium spent its force, and through the\r\ntempests of his bosom the light of reason came back.\r\n\r\nOne night he slept more soundly than usual; and on the next morning his\r\nfaithful friends saw from the expression of his countenance and the\r\nlight in his eyes that his reason had returned. They sent for their\r\nfamily physician, a man in whose honor they could confide. All that\r\ncareful nursing and medical skill could do was done, but it was in vain;\r\nhis strength was wasted; the silver cord was loosed, and the golden bowl\r\nwas broken; his life was fast ebbing away. Like a tempest tossed mariner\r\ndying in sight of land, so he passing away from earth, found the\r\nprecious, longed for, and dearly bought prize was just before, but his\r\nhand was too feeble to grasp, his arms too powerless to hold it.\r\n\r\nHis friends saw from the expression of his face that he had something to\r\nsay; and they bent down to catch the last words of the departing spirit.\r\n\r\n"I am dying," he said, "but I am thankful that I have come this near to\r\nfreedom."\r\n\r\nHe attempted to say no more, the death rattles sounded in his throat;\r\nthe shadows that never deceive flitted o\'er his face, and he was dead.\r\nHis spirit gone back to God, another witness against the giant crime of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nJosiah came again to see him, and entered the room just as the released\r\nspirit winged its flight. Silently he uncovered him as if paying that\r\nreverence to the broken casket which death exacts for his meanest\r\nsubjects. With tenderness and respect they prepared the body for the\r\ngrave, followed him to the silent tomb, and left him to his dreamless\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Installment missing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n\r\n"Friend Carpenter, I have brought a friend to see you. He is a real\r\nhot-headed Southerner, and I have been trying to convert him, but have\r\nbeen almost ready to give it up as a hopeless task. I thought as you are\r\nso much better posted than I am on the subject, _you_ might be able to\r\nconvert him from the error of his ways. He is a first-rate fellow, my\r\nCollege chum. He has only one fault, he will defend Slavery. Cure him of\r\nthat, and I think he will be as near perfect as young men generally\r\nare."\r\n\r\nFriend Carpenter smiled at this good-natured rally, and said, "It takes\r\ntime for all things. Perhaps your friend is not so incorrigible as you\r\nthink he is."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Charley, "but here he is; he can speak for\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"Oh the system is well enough of itself, but like other things, it is\r\nliable to abuse."\r\n\r\n"I think, my young friend," said Thomas, "thee has never examined the\r\nsystem by the rule of impartial justice, which tells us to do to all men\r\nas we would have them do to us. If thee had, thee would not talk of the\r\nabuses of Slavery, when the system is an abuse itself. I am afraid thee\r\nhas never gauged the depth of its wickedness. Thy face looks too honest\r\nand frank to defend this system from conviction. Has thee ever examined\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"Why, no, I have always been used to it."\r\n\r\nLouis, who liked the honest bluntness of the Quaker, would have\r\nwillingly prolonged the conversation, simply for the sake of the\r\nargument, but just then Minnie entered, holding in her hand a bunch of\r\nflowers, and started to show them to her father, before she perceived\r\nthat any company was in the room.\r\n\r\n"Oh father," said she, "see what I have brought you!" when her eye fell\r\nupon the visitors, and a bright flush overspread her cheek, lending it\r\nadditional beauty.\r\n\r\nCharles immediately arose, and giving her his hand, introduced her to\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to see you, Minnie; you are looking so well this summer,"\r\nsaid Charles, gazing on her with unfeigned admiration.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you think so," said she, with charming frankness.\r\n\r\nSome business having called friend Carpenter from the room, the young\r\npeople had a pleasant time to themselves, talking of books, poetry, and\r\nthe current literature of the day, although being students, their\r\nacquaintance with these things was somewhat limited. By the time they\r\nwere ready to go, Thomas had re-entered the room and bidding them\r\ngood-bye, cordially invited them to return again.\r\n\r\n"What do you think of her?" said Charles to his friend.\r\n\r\n"Beautiful as a dream. The half had not been told. Her _acquaintance_\r\npays me for my trip; yes, I would like to become better acquainted with\r\nher; there was such a charming simplicity about her, and such unaffected\r\ngrace that I am really delighted with her. How is it that you have never\r\nfallen in love with her?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have left that for you; but in fact we have almost grown\r\ntogether, played with each other when we were children, until she\r\nappears like one of our family, and to marry her would be like marrying\r\nmy own sister."\r\n\r\n"How does thee like Charles\' friend?" said Minnie, to her adopted\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThomas spoke slowly and deliberately, and said, "He impresses me rather\r\nfavorably. I think there\'s the making of a man in him. But I hear that\r\nhe is pro-slavery."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is, but I think that is simply the result of former\r\nassociations and surroundings. I do not believe that he has looked\r\ndeeper than the surface of Slavery; he is quite young yet; his\r\nreflective faculties are hardly fully awakened. I believe the time will\r\ncome, when he will see it in its true light, and if he joins our ranks\r\nhe will be an important accession to our cause. I have great hopes of\r\nhim. He seems to be generous, kind-hearted, and full of good impulses,\r\nand I believe there are grand possibilities in his nature. How do you\r\nlike him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I was much pleased with him. We had a very pleasant time together."\r\n\r\nIn a few days, Charles and Louis called again. Minnie was crocheting,\r\nand her adopted mother was occupied with sewing; while Thomas engaged\r\nthem in conversation, the subject being the impending conflict; Louis,\r\ntaking a decided stand in favor of the South, and Thomas being equally\r\nstrong in his defense of the North.\r\n\r\nThe conversation was very animated, but temperate; and when they parted,\r\neach felt confident of the rightfulness of his position.\r\n\r\n"Come, again," said Thomas, as they were leaving; "we can\'t see eye to\r\neye, but I like to have thee come."\r\n\r\nLouis was very much pleased with the invitation, for it gave him\r\nopportunity to see Minnie, and sometimes she would smile, or say a word\r\nor two when the discussion was beginning to verge on the borders of\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nThe time to return to College was drawing near, and Louis longed to tell\r\nher how dear she was to him, but he never met her alone. She was so\r\nyoung he did not like to ask the privilege of writing to her; and yet he\r\nfelt when he left the village, that it would afford him great\r\nsatisfaction to hear from her. He once hinted to Friend Carpenter that\r\nhe would like to hear from his family, and that if he was too busy\r\nperhaps Miss Minnie might find time to drop a line, but Thomas did not\r\ntake the hint, so the matter ended; he hoping in the meantime to meet\r\nher again, and renew their very pleasant acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n\r\n[Text missing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\n\r\n"Is Minnie not well?" said Thomas Carpenter, entering one morning, the\r\npleasant room, where Anna was labelling some preserves. "She seems to be\r\nso drooping, and scarcely eats anything."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I have not heard her complain; perhaps she is a little\r\ntired and jaded from her journey; and then I think she studies too much.\r\nShe spends most of her time in her room, and since I think of it, she\r\ndoes appear more quiet than usual; but I have been so busy about my\r\npreserves that I have not noticed her particularly."\r\n\r\n"Anna," said Thomas suddenly, after a moment\'s pause, "does thee think\r\nthat there is any attachment between Louis and Minnie? He was very\r\nattentive to her when we were in Boston."\r\n\r\n"Why, Thomas, I have never thought anything about it. Minnie always\r\nseems so much like a child that I never get her associated in my mind\r\nwith courtship and marriage. I suppose I ought to though," said Anna,\r\nwith the faintest sigh.\r\n\r\n"Anna, I think that something is preying on that child\'s mind, and\r\nmother, thee knows that you women understand how to manage these things\r\nbetter than we men do, and I wish thee would find out what is the matter\r\nwith the child. Try to find out if there is anything between her and\r\nLouis, and if there is, by all means we must let her know about herself;\r\nit is a duty we owe her and him."\r\n\r\n"Well, Thomas, if we must we must; but I shrink from it. Here she comes.\r\nNow I\'ll leave in a few minutes, and then thee can tell her; perhaps\r\nthee can do it better than I can."\r\n\r\n"What makes thee look so serious?" said Thomas, as Minnie entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Do I, father?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thee looks sober as a Judge. What has happened to disturb thee?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing in particular; only I was down to Mr. Hickman\'s this morning,\r\nand they have a colored woman stopping with them. She is a very\r\ninteresting and intelligent woman, and she was telling us part of her\r\nhistory, and it was very interesting, but, mother, I do think it is a\r\ndreadful thing to be a colored person in this country; how I should\r\nsuffer if I knew that I was hated and despised for what I couldn\'t help.\r\nOh, it must be dreadful to be colored."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t talk so, Minnie, God never makes any mistakes."\r\n\r\n"I know that, mother; but, mother, it must be hard to be forced to ride\r\nin smoking cars; to be insulted in the different thoroughfares of\r\ntravel; to be denied access to public resorts in some places,--such as\r\nlectures, theatres, concerts, and even have a particular seat assigned\r\nin the churches, and sometimes feel you were an object of pity even to\r\nyour best friends. I know that Mrs. Heston felt so when she was telling\r\nher story, for when Mrs. Hickman said, \'Well, Sarah, I really pity you,\'\r\nI saw her dark eyes flash, and she has really beautiful eyes, as she\r\nsaid, \'it is not pity we want, it is justice.\'"\r\n\r\n"In the first place, mother, she is a widow, with five children. She had\r\nsix. One died in the army,--and she had some business in Washington\r\nconnected with him. She says she was born in Virginia, and had one\r\nlittle girl there, but as she could not bear the idea of her child\r\ngrowing up in ignorance, she left the South and went to Albany. Her\r\nhusband was a barber, and was doing a good business there. She was\r\nliving in a very good neighborhood, and sent her child to the nearest\r\ndistrict school.\r\n\r\n"After her little girl had been there awhile, her teacher told her she\r\nmust go home and not come there any more, and sent her mother a note;\r\nthe child did not know what she had done; she had been attentive to her\r\nlessons, and had not behaved amiss, and she was puzzled to know why she\r\nwas turned out of school.\r\n\r\n"\'Oh! I hated to tell Mrs. Heston,\' said the teacher; \'but the child\r\ninsisted, and I knew that it must come sooner or later. And so, said\r\nshe, I told her it was because she was colored.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Is that all.\' Poor child, she didn\'t know, that, in that fact lay\r\nwhole volumes of insult, outrage, and violence. I made up my mind, she\r\ncontinued, that I would leave the place, and when my husband came home,\r\nI said, \'Heston, let us leave this place; let us go farther west. I hear\r\nthat we can have our child educated there, just the same as any other\r\nchild.\' At first my husband demurred, for we were doing a good business;\r\nbut I said, let us go, if we have to live on potatoes and salt.\r\n\r\n"True, it was some pecuniary loss; but I never regretted it, although I\r\nhave been pretty near the potatoes and salt. My husband died, but I kept\r\nmy children together, and stood over the wash-tub day after day to keep\r\nthem at school. My oldest daughter graduated at the High School, and was\r\nquite a favorite with the teachers. One term there was a vacancy in her\r\nroom, caused by the resignation of one of the assistant teachers, and\r\nthe first teacher had the privilege of selecting her assistants from the\r\ngraduates of the High School, their appointment, of course, being\r\nsubject to the decision of the Commissioner of Public Schools.\r\n\r\n"\'Her teacher having heard that she was connected by blood with one of\r\nthe first families of Virginia, told the Commissioner that she had\r\nchosen an Assistant, a young lady of high qualifications, and as she\r\nunderstood, a descendant of Patrick Henry.\r\n\r\n"\'Ah, indeed,\' said the Commissioner, \'I didn\'t know that we had one of\r\nthat family among us. By all means employ her;\' but as she was about to\r\nleave, she said: \'I forgot to tell you one thing, she is colored.\'\r\n\r\n"A sudden change came over him, and he said: \'Do you think I would have\r\nyou walk down the street with a colored woman? Of course not. I\'ll never\r\ngive my consent to _that_.\' And there the matter ended. And then she\r\nmade us feel so indignant when she told us that on her way to Washington\r\nto get her son\'s pension, she stopped in Philadelphia, and the conductor\r\ntried to make her leave the car, and because she would not, he ran the\r\ncar off the track."\r\n\r\n"Oh, father," said she, turning to Thomas, "how wicked and cruel this\r\nprejudice. Oh, how I should hate to be colored!"\r\n\r\nAnna and Thomas exchanged mournful glances. Their hearts were too full;\r\nand as Minnie left the room, Thomas said, "Not now, Anna. Not just yet."\r\nAnd so Minnie[6] was permitted to return again to school with the secret\r\nuntold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"Minnie, darling, what are you doing? moping as usual over your books?\r\nCome, it is Saturday morning, and you have worked hard enough for one\r\nweek; got all good marks; so now just put up that Virgil, and come go\r\nout with me."\r\n\r\n"Where do you wish to go?" said Minnie, to her light-hearted friend,\r\nCarrie Wise.\r\n\r\n"I want to go out shopping. Pa has just sent me twenty dollars, and you\r\nknow a girl and her money are soon parted."\r\n\r\n"What do you wish to get?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I want a pair of gloves, some worsted to match this fringe, and a\r\nlot of things. Come, won\'t you go?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know, I didn\'t intend going out this morning."\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind if you didn\'t, just say you will go. Where\'s your hat\r\nand mantle?" said Carrie, going to her wardrobe.\r\n\r\n"Well, just wait till I fix my hair; it won\'t take long."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Minnie, do let me fix it for you! If ever I have to work for my\r\nliving, I shall be a hair-dresser. I believe it is the only thing that I\r\nhave any talent for."\r\n\r\n"What an idea! But do, Minnie, won\'t you, let me arrange your hair? You\r\nalways wear it so plain, and I do believe it would curl beautifully. May\r\nI, Minnie?"\r\n\r\n"Why yes."\r\n\r\nSo Carrie sat down, and in a short time, she had beautifully arranged\r\nMinnie\'s hair with a profusion of curls.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what I was thinking?" said Carrie, gazing admiringly upon\r\nher friend. "You look so much like a picture I have seen of yours in\r\nyour father\'s album. He was showing me a number of pictures which\r\nrepresent you at different ages, and the one I refer to, he said was our\r\nMinnie when she was five years old. Now let me put on your hat. And let\r\nme kiss you for you look so pretty?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Carrie, what an idea! You are so full of nonsense. Which way will\r\nwe go first?"\r\n\r\n"First down to Carruther\'s. I saw a beautiful collar there I liked so\r\nmuch; and then let us go down to Mrs. Barguay\'s. I want to show you a\r\nlove of a bonnet, one of the sweetest little things in ribbon, lace, and\r\nflowers I ever saw."\r\n\r\nEquipped for the journey the two friends sauntered down the street; as\r\nthey were coming out of a store, Carrie stopped for a moment to speak to\r\na very dear friend of her mother\'s, and Minnie passed on.\r\n\r\nAs she went slowly on, loitering for her friend, she saw a woman\r\napproaching her from the opposite side of the street. There was\r\nsomething in her look and manner which arrested the attention of Minnie.\r\nShe was a tall, slender woman about thirty five years old, with a pale,\r\ncare-worn face--a face which told that sorrow had pressed her more than\r\nyears. A few threads of silver mingled with the wealth of her raven\r\nhair, and her face, though wearing a sad and weary expression, still\r\nshowed traces of great beauty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as her eyes fell on Minnie, she raised her hands in sudden\r\nwonder, and clasping her in her arms, exclaimed: "Heaven is merciful! I\r\nhave found you, at last, my dear, darling, long-lost child. Minnie, is\r\nthis you, and have I found you at last?"\r\n\r\nMinnie trembled from head to foot; a deadly pallor overspread her cheek,\r\nand she stood still as if rooted to the ground in silent amazement,\r\nwhile the woman stood anxiously watching her as if her future were\r\nhanging on the decision of her lips.\r\n\r\n"Who are you? and where did you come from?" said Minnie, as soon as she\r\ngained her breath.\r\n\r\n"I came from Louisiana. Oh, I can\'t be mistaken. I have longed for you,\r\nand prayed for you, and now I have found you."\r\n\r\nJust then, Carrie, who had finished speaking with her friend, seeing\r\nMinnie and the strange woman talking together, exclaimed, "What is the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\nNoticing the agitation of her friend, "Who is this woman, and what has\r\nshe said to you?"\r\n\r\n"She says that she is my mother, my long-lost mother."\r\n\r\n"Why, Minnie, what nonsense! She can\'t be your mother. Why don\'t you see\r\nshe is colored?"\r\n\r\n"Where do you live?" said Minnie, without appearing to notice the words\r\nof Carrie.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t live anywhere. I just came here yesterday with some of the\r\nUnion soldiers."\r\n\r\n"Come with me then, and I will show you a place to stop."\r\n\r\n"Why, Minnie, you are not going to walk down the street with that\r\nNig--colored woman; if you are, please excuse me. My business calls me\r\nanother way."\r\n\r\nAnd without any more ceremony Carrie and Minnie parted. Silently she\r\nwalked by the side of the stranger, a thousand thoughts revolving in her\r\nmind. Was this the solution of the mystery which enshrouded her young\r\nlife? Did she indeed belong to that doomed and hated race, and must she\r\nshare the cruel treatment which bitter, relentless prejudice had\r\nassigned them?\r\n\r\nThomas Carpenter and Anna were stopping in P., at the house of relatives\r\nwho knew Minnie\'s history, but who had never made any difference in\r\ntheir treatment of her on that account.\r\n\r\n"Is father and mother at home?" said Minnie to the servant, who opened\r\nthe door. She answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n"Tell them to come into the parlor, they are wanted immediately."\r\n\r\n"Sit down," said Minnie to the stranger, handing her a chair, "and wait\r\ntill father comes."\r\n\r\nAnna and Thomas soon entered the room, and Minnie approaching them said,\r\n"Father, this woman met me on the street to-day, and says she is my\r\nmother. You know all about my history. Tell me if there is any truth in\r\nthis story."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Minnie, I never saw thy mother."\r\n\r\n"But question her, father, and see if there is any truth in what she\r\nsays; but tell me first, father, am I white or colored?"\r\n\r\n"Minnie, I believe there is a small portion of colored blood in thy\r\nveins."\r\n\r\n"It is enough," said Minnie, drawing closer to the strange woman. "What\r\nmakes you think that I am your child?"\r\n\r\n"By this," said she, taking a miniature from her bosom. "By this, which\r\nI carried next to my heart for more than twelve years, and never have\r\nbeen without it a single day or night."\r\n\r\nThomas looked upon the miniature; it was an exact likeness of Minnie\r\nwhen she first came to them, and although she had grown and changed\r\nsince the likeness was taken, there was too close a resemblance between\r\nit and one which had been taken soon after she came, for him to doubt\r\nthat Minnie was the original of that likeness.\r\n\r\nThomas questioned the woman very closely, but her history and narrative\r\ncorresponded so well with what he had heard of Minnie\'s mother, that he\r\ncould not for a moment doubt that this was she, and as such he was\r\nwilling to give her the shelter of his home, till he could make other\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n"But why," said Anna, somewhat grieved at the shock, that Minnie had\r\nreceived, "did thee startle her by so suddenly claiming her in the\r\nstreet? Would it not have been better for thee to have waited and found\r\nout where she lived, and then discovered thyself to her?"\r\n\r\n"I\'spect it would, \'Mam," said Ellen, very meekly and sorrowfully, "but\r\nwhen I saw her and heard the young lady say, Minnie, wait a minute, I\r\nforgot everything but that this was my long-lost child. I am sorry if I\r\ndid any harm, but I was so glad I could not help it. My heart was so\r\nhungry for my child."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Anna sadly, "I understand thee; it was the voice of\r\nnature."\r\n\r\nMinnie was too nervous and excited to return to her school that day; the\r\nnext morning she had a very high fever, and Thomas concluded it would be\r\nbetter to take her home and have her mother accompany her.\r\n\r\nAnd so on Monday morning Anna and Thomas left P., taking Minnie and her\r\nmother along.\r\n\r\nOnce again in her pleasant home, surrounded by the tenderest care (for\r\nher mother watched over her with the utmost solicitude) the violence of\r\nher fever abated, but it was succeeded by a low nervous affection which\r\nwhile it produced no pain yet it slowly unstrung her vitality.\r\n\r\nEllen hovered around her pillow as if she begrudged every moment that\r\ncalled her from her daughter\'s side, and never seemed so well contented\r\nas when she was performing for her some office of love and tenderness. A\r\nskilful nurse, she knew how to prepare the most delicate viands to tempt\r\nthe failing appetite, and she had the exquisite pleasure of seeing her\r\ncare and attention rewarded by the returning health and strength of her\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nOne morning as she grew stronger, and was able to sit in her chair, she\r\nturned her eyes tenderly towards Ellen and said, "Mother, come and sit\r\nnear me and let me hold your hand."\r\n\r\n"Mother," Oh how welcome was that word. Ellen\'s eyes filled with sudden\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Mother," she said, "It comes back to me like a dream. I have a faint\r\nrecollection of having seen you before, but it is so long I can scarcely\r\nremember it. Tell me all about myself and how I came to leave you. I\r\nalways thought that there was some mystery about me, but I never knew\r\nwhat it was before, but now I understand it."\r\n\r\n"Darling," said the mother, "you had better wait till you get a little\r\nstronger, and then I will tell you all."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Minnie, "you have been so good to me and I am\r\nbeginning to love you so much."\r\n\r\nIt was touching to see the ripening love between those two\r\nlong-suffering ones. Ellen would comb Minnie\'s hair, and do for her\r\nevery office in her power. Still Minnie continued feeble. The suffering\r\noccasioned by her refusal of Louis; the hard study and deep excitement\r\nthrough which she had passed told sadly upon her constitution; but she\r\nwas young, and having a large share of recuperative power she slowly\r\ncame back to health and strength, and when the spring opened Thomas\r\ndecided that she should return again to her school in P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now return to Carrie Wise, whom we left parting with Minnie.\r\n\r\n"Where is Minnie?" said two of her schoolmates, who observed that\r\nCarrie had come home alone.\r\n\r\n"Oh," said she, "one of the strangest things I ever heard of happened!"\r\n\r\n"Well, what was it?" said the girls; and by this time they had joined\r\nanother group of girls.\r\n\r\n"Why this morning, Minnie and I walked out shopping, and just as I came\r\nout of Carruthers\' I met an old friend of mother\'s, and stopped to speak\r\nwith her, and I said \'Minnie, just wait a minute.\'"\r\n\r\n"She passed on, and left me talking with Mrs. Jackson. When I joined\r\nher, I found a colored woman talking to her, and she was trembling from\r\nhead to foot, and just as pale as a ghost; and I said, \'Why, Minnie,\r\nwhat is the matter?\'"\r\n\r\n"She gasped for breath, and I thought she was going to faint, and I got\r\nreal scared. And what do you think Minnie said?"\r\n\r\n"Why," she said, "Carrie, this woman says she\'s my mother!"\r\n\r\n"Her mother!" cried a half dozen voices. "Why you said she was colored!"\r\n\r\n"Well, so she was. She was quite light, but I knew she was colored."\r\n\r\n"How did you know? Maybe she was only a very dark-complexioned white\r\nwoman."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, she wasn\'t, I know white people from colored, I\'ve seen enough\r\nof them."\r\n\r\n"A colored woman! well that is very strange; but do tell us what Minnie\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n"She asked her where she came from, and where she lived. She said she\r\ncame in yesterday with the Union soldiers, and that she had come from\r\nLouisiana, and then Minnie told her to come with her, and she would find\r\na place for her to stop."\r\n\r\n"And did she leave you in the street to walk with a Nigger?" said a\r\ncoarse, rough-looking girl.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and so I left her. I wasn\'t going to walk down the street with\r\nthem!"\r\n\r\n"Well, did I ever?" said a pale and interesting-looking girl.\r\n\r\n"That is just as strange as a romance I have been reading!"\r\n\r\n"Well, they say truth is stranger than fiction. A deceitful thing to try\r\nto pass for white when she is colored! If she comes back to this school\r\nI shan\'t stay!" said the coarse rough girl, twirling her gold pencil. "I\r\nain\'t a going to sit alongside of niggers."\r\n\r\n"How you talk! I don\'t see that if the woman is Minnie\'s mother, and\r\n_is_ colored, it makes any difference in her. I am sure it does not to\r\nme," said one of Minnie\'s friends.\r\n\r\n"Well, it does to me," said another; "you may put yourself on an\r\nequality with niggers, but I won\'t." "And I neither," chimed in another\r\nvoice. "There are plenty of colored schools; let her go to them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, girls, I think it real cruel the way you talk!"\r\n\r\n"How would you like any one to treat you so?" "Can\'t help it, I ain\'t a\r\ncoming to school with a nigger." "She is just as good as you are, Mary\r\nPatuck, and a great deal smarter." "I don\'t care, she\'s a nigger, and\r\nthat\'s enough for me."\r\n\r\nAnd so the sentiment of the school was divided. Some were in favor of\r\ntreating her just as well as usual, and others felt like complaining to\r\ntheir parents that a Negro was in school.\r\n\r\nAt last the news reached the teacher, and he, poor, weak, and\r\nvacillating man, had not manhood enough to defend her, but acted\r\naccording to the prejudices of society, and wrote Thomas a note telling\r\nhim that circumstances made it desirable that she should not again come\r\nto school.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the news had reached their quiet little village, and of\r\ncourse it offered food for gossip; it was discussed over tea-tables and\r\nin the sewing circle. Some concluded that Thomas should have brought her\r\nup among the colored people, and others that he did perfectly right.\r\n\r\nStill there was a change in Minnie\'s social relations. Some were just\r\nas kind as ever. Others grew distant, and some avoided having anything\r\nto say to her, and stopped visiting the house. Anna and Thomas, although\r\nsuperior people, were human, and could not help feeling the difference,\r\nbut some business of importance connected with the death of a relative\r\ncalled Thomas abroad, and he made up his mind that he would take Anna\r\nand Minnie with him, hoping that the voyage and change of scene would be\r\nbeneficial to his little girl, as he still called Minnie, and so on a\r\nbright and beautiful morning in the spring of \'62 he left the country\r\nfor a journey to England and the Continent.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to Louis Le Croix, whom we left disappointed and\r\nwounded by Minnie\'s refusal. After he left her he entered his room, and\r\nsat for a long time in silent thought; at last he rose, and walked to\r\nthe window and stood with his hands clenched, and his finely chiseled\r\nlips firmly set as if he had bound his whole soul to some great\r\nresolve--a resolve which he would accomplish, let it cost what it might.\r\n\r\nAnd so he had; for he had made up in his mind within the last two hours\r\nthat he would join the Confederacy. "That live or die, sink or swim,\r\nsurvive or perish," he would unite his fortunes to her destiny.\r\n\r\nHis next step then was to plan how he could reach Louisiana; he felt\r\nconfident that if he could get as far as Louisville he could manage to\r\nget into Tennessee, and from thence to Louisiana.\r\n\r\nAnd so nothing daunted by difficulties and dangers, he set out on his\r\njourney, and being aided by rebels on his way in a few weeks he reached\r\nthe old plantation on Red River; he found his sister and Miriam there\r\nboth glad to see him.\r\n\r\nCamilla\'s husband was in Charleston, some of the slaves had deserted to\r\nthe Union ranks, but the greater portion she still retained with her.\r\n\r\nMiriam was delighted to see Louis, and seemed never weary of admiring\r\nhis handsome face and manly form. And Louis, who had never known any\r\nother mother seemed really gratified by her little kindnesses and\r\nattention; but of course the pleasant and quiet monotony of home did not\r\nsuit the restless and disquieted spirit of Louis. All the young men\r\naround here were in the army or deeply interested in its success.\r\n\r\nThere was a call for more volunteers, and a new company was to be raised\r\nin that locality. Louis immediately joined, and turned his trained\r\nintellect to the study of military tactics; day and night he was\r\nabsorbed in this occupation, and soon, although Minnie was not\r\nforgotten, the enthusiasm of his young life gathered around the\r\nConfederate cause.\r\n\r\nHe did not give himself much time to reflect. Thought was painful to\r\nhim, and he continued to live in a whirl of excitement.\r\n\r\nNews of battle, tidings of victory and defeats, the situation of the\r\narmies, and the hopes and fears that clustered around those fearful days\r\nof struggle made the staple of conversation.\r\n\r\nLouis rapidly rose in favor with the young volunteers, and was chosen\r\ncaptain of a company who were permitted to drill and stay from the front\r\nas a reserve corps, ready to be summoned at any moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMiriam and Camilla watched with anguish Louis\' devotion to the\r\nConfederation, and many sorrowful conversations they had about it.\r\n\r\nAt last one day Miriam said, "Miss Camilla, I can stand it no\r\nlonger;--that boy is going to lift his hand agin his own people, and I\r\ncan\'t stand it no longer; I\'se got to tell him all about it. I just\r\nthink I\'d bust in two if I didn\'t tell him."\r\n\r\n"Well, Mammy," said Camilla, "I\'d rather he should know it than that he\r\nshould go against his country and raise his hand against the dear old\r\nflag."\r\n\r\n"It\'s not the flag nor the country I care for," said Miriam, "but it is\r\nthat one of my own flesh and blood should jine with these secesh agin\r\nhis own people."\r\n\r\n"Well, Miriam, if you get a chance you can tell him."\r\n\r\n"Get a chance, Miss Camilla, I\'se bound to get that."\r\n\r\nLouis was somewhat reticent about his plans; for he knew that Camilla\r\nwas a strong Union woman; that she not only loved the flag, but she had\r\ntaught her two boys to do the same; but he understood from headquarters\r\nthat his company was to march in a week, and although on that subject\r\nthere was no common sympathy between them, yet he felt that he must\r\nacquaint her with his plans, and bid her and Miriam good-bye.\r\n\r\nSo one morning he came in looking somewhat flushed and excited, and\r\nsaid: "Sister, we have got our marching orders; we leave on Thursday,\r\nand I have only three days to be with you. I am sorry that I have seen\r\nso little of you, but my country calls me, and when she is in danger it\r\nis no time for me to seek for either ease or pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Your country! Louis," said Miriam, her face paling and flushing by\r\nturns. "Where is your country?"\r\n\r\n"Here," said he, somewhat angrily, "in Louisiana."\r\n\r\n"My country," said Camilla,[7] "is the whole Union. Yes, Louis," said\r\nshe, "your country is in danger, but not from the Abolitionists in the\r\nNorth, but from the rebels and traitors in the South."\r\n\r\n"Rebels and traitors!" said Louis, in a tone like one who felt the harsh\r\ngrating of the words.\r\n\r\n"Whom do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"I mean," said she, "the ambitious, reckless men who have brought about\r\nthis state of things. The men who are stabbing their country in their\r\nmadness and folly; who are crowding our graves and darkening our homes;\r\nwho are dragging our young men, men like you, who should be the pride\r\nand hope of our country, into the jaws of ruin and death."\r\n\r\nLouis looked surprised and angry; he had never seen Camilla under such\r\ndeep excitement. Her words had touched his pride and roused his anger;\r\nbut suppressing his feelings he answered her coolly, "Camilla, I am old\r\nenough to do my own thinking. We had better drop this subject; it is not\r\npleasant to either of us."\r\n\r\n"Louis," said she, her whole manner changing from deep excitement to\r\nprofound grief, "Oh, Louis, it will never do for you to go! Oh, no, you\r\nmust not!"\r\n\r\n"And why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because,"--and she hesitated. Just then Miriam took up the unfinished\r\nsentence,"--because to join the secesh is to raise your hands agin your\r\nown race."\r\n\r\n"My own race?" and Louis laughed scornfully. "I think you are talking\r\nmore wildly than Camilla. What do you mean, Miriam?"\r\n\r\n"I mean," said she, stung by his scornful words, "I mean that you, Louis\r\nLe Croix, white as you look, are colored, and that you are my own\r\ndaughter\'s child, and if it had not been for Miss Camilla, who\'s been\r\nsuch an angel to you, that you would have been a slave to-day, and then\r\nyou wouldn\'t have been a Confederate."\r\n\r\nAt these words a look of horror and anguish passed over the face of Le\r\nCroix, and he turned to Camilla, but she was deadly pale, and trembling\r\nlike an aspen leaf; but her eyes were dry and tearless.\r\n\r\n"Camilla," said he, turning fiercely to his adopted sister, "Tell me, is\r\nthere any truth in these words? You are as pale as death, and trembling\r\nlike a leaf,--tell me if there is any truth in these words," turning and\r\nfixing his eyes on Miriam, who stood like some ancient prophetess, her\r\nlips pronouncing some fearful doom, while she watched in breathless\r\nanguish the effect upon the fated victim.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Louis," said Camilla, in a voice almost choked by emotion. "Yes,\r\nLouis, it is all true."\r\n\r\n"But how is this that I never heard it before? Before I believe this\r\ntale I must have some proof, clear as daylight. Bring me proofs."\r\n\r\n"Here they are," said Miriam, drawing from her pocket the free papers\r\nshe had been carrying about her person for several days.\r\n\r\nLouis grasped them nervously, hastily read them, and then more slowly,\r\nlike one who might read a sentence of death to see if there was one word\r\nor sentence on which he might hang a hope of reprieve.\r\n\r\nCamilla watched him anxiously, but silently, and when he had finished,\r\nhe covered his bowed face with his hands as he said with a deep groan,\r\n"It is true, too true. I see it all. I can never raise my hand against\r\nmy mother\'s race."\r\n\r\nHe arose like one in a dream, walked slowly to the door and left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"It was a painful task," said Camilla, with a sigh of relief, as if a\r\nburden had fallen from her soul.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Miriam, "but not so bad as to see him fighting agin his own\r\ncolor. I\'d rather follow him to his grave than see him join that\r\nmiserable secesh crew."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Camilla, "It was better than letting him go."\r\n\r\nWhen Louis left the room a thousand conflicting thoughts passed through\r\nhis mind. He felt as a mariner at midnight on a moonless sea, who\r\nsuddenly, when the storm is brewing, finds that he has lost his compass\r\nand his chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere was he steering; and now, the course of his life was changed, what\r\nkind of future must he make for himself?\r\n\r\nHad it been in time of peace, he could have easily decided, as he had a\r\nlarge amount of money in the North, which his father left him when he\r\ncame of age.\r\n\r\nHe would have no difficulty as to choosing the means of living; for he\r\nwas well supplied, as far as that was concerned; but here was a most\r\nunpleasant dilemma in which he had placed himself.\r\n\r\nConvinced that he was allied to the Negro race, his whole soul rose up\r\nagainst the idea of laying one straw in its way; if he belonged to the\r\nrace he would not join its oppressors. And yet his whole sympathy had\r\nbeen so completely with them, that he felt that he had no feeling in\r\ncommon with the North.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the colored people, of course it never entered his mind to\r\njoin their ranks, and ally himself to them; he had always regarded them\r\nas inferior; and this sudden and unwelcome revelation had not changed\r\nthe whole tenor of his thoughts and opinions.\r\n\r\nBut what he had to do must be done quickly; for in less than three days\r\nhis company would start for the front. To desert was to face death; to\r\nremain was to wed dishonor. He surveyed the situation calmly and\r\nbravely, and then resolved that he would face the perils of re-capture\r\nrather than the contempt of his own soul.\r\n\r\nWhile he was deciding, he heard Camilla\'s step in the passage; he opened\r\nthe door, and beckoned her to a seat, and said, very calmly, "I have\r\nbeen weighing the whole matter in my mind, and I have concluded to leave\r\nthe South."\r\n\r\n"How can you do it?" said Camilla. "I tremble lest you should be\r\ndiscovered. Oh slavery! what a curse. Our fathers sowed the wind, and we\r\nare reaping the whirlwind! What," continued she, as if speaking to\r\nherself, "What are your plans? Have you any?"\r\n\r\n"None, except to disguise myself and escape."\r\n\r\n"When?"\r\n\r\n"As soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"Suppose I call Miriam. She can help you. Shall I?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nCamilla called Miriam, and after a few moments consultation it was\r\ndecided that Louis should escape that night, and that Miriam should\r\nprepare whatever was needed for his hasty flight.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t trust your secret to any white person," said Miriam, "but if you\r\nmeet any of the colored people, just tell them that you is for the\r\nLinkum soldiers, and it will be all right; we don\'t know all about this\r\nwar, but we feels somehow we\'s all mixed up in it."\r\n\r\nAnd so with many prayers and blessings from Miriam, and sad farewells\r\nfrom Camilla, he left his home to enter upon that perilous flight, the\r\nwhole current of his life changed.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early part of Winter; but the air was just as pleasant as\r\nearly Spring in that climate. Louis walked all that night, guiding\r\nhimself northward at night by the light of the stars and a little pocket\r\ncompass, Camilla had just given him before starting, and avoiding the\r\npublic roads during the day.\r\n\r\nAnd thus he travelled for two days, when his lunch was exhausted, his\r\nlips parched with thirst, and his strength began to fail.\r\n\r\nJust in this hour of extremity he saw seated by the corner of a fence a\r\nvery black and homely-looking woman; there was something so gloomy and\r\nsullen in her countenance that he felt repelled by its morose\r\nexpression. Still he needed food, and was very weary, and drawing near\r\nhe asked her if she would give him anything to eat.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t got nothing. De sojers done been here, and eat all up."\r\n\r\nLouis drew near and whispered a few words in her ear, and immediately a\r\nchange passed over her whole countenance. The sullen expression turned\r\nto a look of tenderness and concern. The harsh tones of her voice\r\nactually grew mellow, and rising up in haste she almost sprang over the\r\nfence, and said, "I\'se been looking for you, if you\'s Northman you\'s\r\nmighty welcome," and she set before him her humble store of provisions.\r\n\r\n"Do you know," said Louis, "where I will find the Lincoln soldiers, or\r\nwhere the secesh are encamped?"\r\n\r\n"No," said she "but my old man\'s mighty smart, and he\'ll find out; you\r\ncome wid me."\r\n\r\nNothing doubting he went, and found the husband ready to do anything in\r\nhis power to help him.\r\n\r\n"You\'s better not go any furder to-day. I\'ll get you a place to hide\r\nwhere nobody can\'t find you, and then I\'ll pump Massa \'bout the sojers."\r\n\r\nTrue to his word, he contrived to find out whether the soldiers were\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n"Massa," said he, scratching his head, and looking quite sober, "Massa,\r\nhadn\'t I better hide the mules? Oh I\'s \'fraid the Linkum sojers will\r\ncome take \'em, cause dey gobbles up ebery ting dey lays dere hans on,\r\njis like geese. I yerd dey was coming; mus\' I hide de mules?"\r\n\r\n"No, Sam, the scalawags are more than a hundred miles away; they are\r\nnear Natchez."\r\n\r\n"Well, maybe, t\'was our own Fedrate soldiers."\r\n\r\n"No, Sam, our nearest soldiers are at Baton Rouge."\r\n\r\n"All right Massa. I don\'t want to lose all dem fine mules."\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was convenient Sam gave Louis the desired information.\r\n"Here," said Sam, when Louis was ready to start again, "is something to\r\nbreak your fast, and if you goes dis way you musn\'t let de white folks\r\nknow what you\'s up to, but you trust dis," said he, laying his hand on\r\nhis own dark skin.\r\n\r\nHis new friend went with him several miles, and pointing him out the way\r\nleft him to pursue his journey onward. The next person he met with was a\r\ncolored man, who bowed and smiled, and took off his hat.\r\n\r\nLouis returned the bow, and was passing on when he said, "Massa, \'scuse\r\nme for speakin\' to you, but dem secesh been hunting all day for a\r\n\'serter, him captin dey say."\r\n\r\nLouis turned pale, but bracing his nerves he said, "Where are they?"\r\n\r\n"Dey\'s in the house; is you he?"\r\n\r\n"I am a Union man," Louis said, "and am trying to reach the Lincoln\r\nsoldiers."\r\n\r\n"Den," said the man, "if dat am de fac I\'s got a place for you; come\r\nwith me," and Louis having learned to trust the colored people followed\r\nhim to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nSoon it was noised abroad that another deserter had been seen in that\r\nneighborhood, but the colored man would not reveal the whereabouts of\r\nLouis. His master beat him severely, but he would let neither threats\r\nnor torture wring the secret from his lips.\r\n\r\nLouis saw the faithfulness of that man, and he thought with shame of his\r\nformer position to the race from whom such unswerving devotion could\r\nspring. The hunt proving ineffectual, Louis after the search and\r\nexcitement had subsided resumed his journey Northward, meeting with\r\nfirst one act of kindness and then another.\r\n\r\nOne day he had a narrow escape from the bloodhounds. He had trusted his\r\nsecret to a colored man who, faithful like the rest, was directing him\r\non his way when deep ominous sounds fell on their ears. The colored man\r\nknew that sound too well; he knew something of the nature of\r\nbloodhounds, and how to throw them off the track.\r\n\r\nSo hastily opening his pen-knife he cut his own feet so that the blood\r\nfrom them might deepen the scent on one track, and throw them off from\r\nLouis\'s path.\r\n\r\nIt was a brave deed, and nobly done, and Louis began to feel that he had\r\nnever known them, and then how vividly came into his mind the words of\r\nDr. Charming: "After all we may be trampling on one of the best branches\r\nof the human race." Here were men and women too who had been trampled on\r\nfor ages ready to break to him their bread, aye share with him their\r\nscanty store.\r\n\r\nOne had taken the shoes from his feet and almost forced him to take\r\nthem. What was it impelled these people? What was the Union to them,\r\nand who were Lincoln\'s soldiers that they should be so ready to\r\ngravitate to the Union army and bring the most reliable information to\r\nthe American General?\r\n\r\nWas it not the hope of freedom which they were binding as amulets around\r\ntheir hearts? They as a race had lived in a measure upon an idea; it was\r\nthe hope of a deliverance yet to come. Faith in God had underlain the\r\nlife of the race, and was it strange if when even some of our\r\npoliticians did not or could not read the signs of the times aright\r\nthese people with deeper intuitions understood the war better than they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBut at last Louis got beyond the borders of the confederacy, and stood\r\nonce more on free soil, appreciating that section as he had never done\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Text missing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n"And I," said Minnie, "will help you pay it."\r\n\r\nAnd so their young hearts had met at last, and with the approval and\r\nhearty consent of Anna, Minnie and Louis were married.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that Minnie should spend the winter in Southern France,\r\nand then in the spring they returned to America. On their arrival they\r\nfound the war still raging, and Louis was ready and anxious to benefit\r\nthat race to whom he felt he owed his life, and with whom he was\r\nconnected by lineage.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty of money, a liberal education, and could have chosen a\r\nlife of ease, but he was too ardent in his temperament, too decided in\r\nhis character, not to feel an interest in the great events which were\r\nthen transpiring in the country.\r\n\r\nHe made the acquaintance of some Anti-Slavery friends, and listened with\r\navidity to their doctrines; he attended a number of war meetings, and\r\ncaught the enthusiasm which inspired the young men who were coming from\r\nvalley, hill, and plain to fill up the broken ranks of the Union army.\r\n\r\nMinnie, educated in peace principles, could not conscientiously\r\nencourage him, and yet when she saw how the liberty of a whole race was\r\ntrembling in the balance she could not help wishing [success?] to the\r\narmy, nor find it in her heart to dissuade him from going.\r\n\r\nOthers had given their loved and cherished ones to camp and field. The\r\nson of a dear friend had said to his mother, "I know I shall be killed,\r\nbut I go to free the slave." His presentiment had been met, for he had\r\nbeen brought home in his shroud.\r\n\r\nAnother dear friend had said, "I have drawn my sword, and it shall never\r\nsleep in its scabbard till the nation is free!" And she had heard that\r\nsummer of \'64 how bravely the colored soldiers had stood at Fort Wagner,\r\nwhen the storms of death were sweeping through the darkened sky. How\r\nthey summoned the world to see the grandeur of their courage and the\r\ndaring of their prowess.\r\n\r\nHow Corny had held with unyielding hand the nation\'s flag, and even when\r\nhe was wounded still held it in his grasp, and crawling from the scene\r\nof action exclaimed, "I only did my duty, the old flag, I didn\'t let it\r\ntrail on the ground."\r\n\r\nAnd she felt on reading it with tearful eyes, that if she belonged to\r\nthat race they had not shamed her by their want of courage; and so when\r\nLouis came to her and told her his intention, she would not attempt to\r\noppose him, and when he was ready to depart, with many prayers, and sad\r\nfarewells, she gave him up to fight the battles of freedom, for such it\r\nwas to him, who went with every nerve in his right arm tingling to\r\nstrike a blow for liberty.\r\n\r\nHitherto Louis had known the race by their tenderness and compassion,\r\nbut the war gave him an opportunity to become acquainted with men brave\r\nto do, brave to dare, and brave to die.\r\n\r\nA colored man was the hero of one of the most tender, touching, and\r\ntragic incidents of the war. A number of soldiers were in a boat exposed\r\nto the fire of the rebels; on board was a colored man who had not\r\nenrolled as a soldier, though his soul was full of sublime valor. The\r\nbullets hissed and split the water, and the rowers tried to get out of\r\ntheir reach, but all their efforts were in vain; the treacherous mud had\r\ncaught the boat, and some one must peril life and limb to shove that\r\nboat into the water. And this man, the member of a doomed, a fated race,\r\nwho had been trodden down for ages, comprehending the danger, said,\r\n"Some one must die to get us out of this, and it mout\'s well be me as\r\nanybody; you are soldiers, and you can fight. If they kill me it is\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\nAnd with these words he arose, gave the boat a push, received a number\r\nof bullets, and died within two days after.\r\n\r\nLouis acquitted himself bravely, and rapidly rose in favor with his\r\nsuperior officers. To him the place of danger was the post of duty. He\r\noften received letters from Minnie, but they were always hopeful; for\r\nshe had learned to look on the bright side of everything.\r\n\r\nShe tried to beguile him with the news of the neighborhood, and to\r\ninspire him with bright hopes for the future; that future in which they\r\nshould clasp hands again and find their duty and their pleasure in\r\nliving for the welfare and happiness of _our_ race, as Minnie would\r\noften say.\r\n\r\nA race upon whose brows God had poured the chrism of a new era--a race\r\nnewly anointed with freedom.\r\n\r\nOh, how the enthusiasm of her young soul gathered around that work! She\r\nfelt it was no mean nor common privilege to be the pioneer of a new\r\ncivilization. If he who makes two blades of grass grow where only one\r\nflourished before is a benefactor of the human race, how much higher\r\nand holier must his or her work be who dispenses light, instead of\r\ndarkness, knowledge, instead of ignorance, and over the ruins of the\r\nslave-pen and auction-block erects institutions of learning.\r\n\r\nShe would say in her letters to Louis that the South will never be\r\nrightly conquered until another army should take the field, and that\r\nmust be an army of civilizers; the army of the pen, and not the sword.\r\nNot the destroyers of towns and cities, but the builders of machines and\r\nfactories; the organizers of peaceful industry and honorable labor; and\r\nas soon as she possibly could she intended to join that great army.\r\n\r\nSometimes Louis would shake his head doubtfully, and tell her that the\r\nSouth was a very sad place to live in, and would be for years, and,\r\nwhile he was willing to bear toil and privation in the cause he had\r\nlearned to love, yet he shrank from exposing her to the social ostracism\r\nwhich she must bear whether she identified herself with the colored race\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nHowever, her brave young heart never failed her, but kept true to its\r\npurpose to join that noble band who left the sunshine of their homes to\r\nhelp build up a new South on the basis of a higher and better\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nLouis remained with the army till Lee had surrendered. The storm-cloud\r\nof battle had passed away, and the thunders of contending batteries no\r\nlonger crashed and vibrated on the air.\r\n\r\nAnd then he returned to Minnie, who still lived with Thomas Carpenter.\r\nVery tender and joyous was their greeting. Louis thought he would rest\r\nawhile and then arrange his affairs to return to the South. In this plan\r\nhe was heartily seconded by Minnie.\r\n\r\nThomas and Anna were sorry to part with her, but they knew that life was\r\nnot made for a holiday of ease and luxury, and so they had no words of\r\ndiscouragement for them. If duty called them to the South it was right\r\nthat they should go; and so they would not throw themselves across the\r\npurpose of their souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore he located, Louis concluded to visit the old homestead, and to\r\npresent his beautiful young bride to his grandmother and Camilla.\r\n\r\nHe knew his adopted sister too well to fear that Minnie would fail to\r\nreceive from her the warmest welcome, and so with eager heart he took\r\npassage on one of the Mississippi boats to New Orleans, intending to\r\nstop in the city a few days, and send word to Camilla; but just as he\r\nwas passing from the levee to the hotel, he caught a glimpse of Camilla\r\nwalking down the street, and stopping the carriage, he alighted, and\r\nspoke to her. She immediately recognized him, although his handsome face\r\nhad become somewhat bronzed by exposure in camp and field.\r\n\r\n"Do not go to the hotel," she said, "you are heartily welcome, come home\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\n"But my wife is along."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, she\'s just as welcome as you are."\r\n\r\n"But, like myself, she is colored."\r\n\r\n"It does not matter. I should not think of your going to a hotel, while\r\nI have a home in the city."\r\n\r\nCamilla following, wondering how she would like the young wife. She had\r\ngreat kindness and compassion for the race, but as far as social\r\nequality was concerned, though she had her strong personal likings, yet,\r\nexcept with Louis, neither custom nor education had reconciled her to\r\nthe maintenance of any equal, social relations with them.\r\n\r\n"My wife," said Louis, introducing Camilla to Minnie. Camilla\r\nimmediately reached out her hand to the young wife, and gave her a\r\ncordial greeting, and they soon fell into a pleasant and animated\r\nconversation. Mutually they were attracted to each other, and when they\r\nreached their destination, Minnie had begun to feel quite at home with\r\nCamilla.\r\n\r\n"How is Aunt Miriam, or rather, my grandmother?" said Louis.\r\n\r\n"She is well, and often wonders what has become of her poor boy; but she\r\nalways has persisted in believing that she would see you again, and I\r\nknow her dear old eyes will run over with gladness. But things have\r\nchanged very much since we parted. We have passed through the fire since\r\nI saw you, and our troubles are not over yet; but we are hoping for\r\nbetter days. But we are at home. Let us alight."\r\n\r\nAnd Louis and Minnie were ushered into a home whose quiet and refined\r\nbeauty were very pleasant to the eye, for Camilla had inherited from her\r\nfather his aesthetic tastes; had made her home and its surroundings\r\nmodels of loveliness. Half a dozen varieties of the sweetest and\r\nbrightest roses clambered up the walls and arrayed them with a garb of\r\nrare beauty. Jessamines breathed their fragrance on the air; magnolias\r\nreared their stately heads and gladdened the eye with the exquisite\r\nbeauty of their flowers.\r\n\r\n"This is an unexpected pleasure," said Camilla, removing Minnie\'s\r\nbonnet, and gazing with unfeigned admiration upon her girlish face, "but\r\nreally some one must enjoy this pleasure besides myself."\r\n\r\nCamilla rang the bell; a bright, smiling girl of about ten years\r\nappeared. "Tell Miriam," she said, "to come; that her boy Louis is\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nMiriam appeared immediately, and throwing her arms around his neck, gave\r\nvent to her feelings in a burst of joy. "I always said you\'d come back.\r\nI\'s prayed for you night and day, and I always believed I\'d see you\r\nafore I died, and now my word\'s come true. There\'s nothing like having\r\nfaith."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s my wife," said Louis, turning to Minnie.\r\n\r\n"Your wife; is you married, honey? Well I hopes you\'ll have a good\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nMinnie came forward and gave her hand to Miriam, as Louis said, "This is\r\nmy grandmother."\r\n\r\nA look of proud satisfaction passed over the old woman\'s face, and a\r\nsudden joy lit up her eyes at these words of pleasant recognition.\r\n\r\n"Ah, my child," said Miriam, "We\'s had a mighty heap of trouble since\r\nyou left. Them miserable secesh searched the house all over for you,\r\nwhen you was gone, and they was mighty sassy; but we didn\'t mind that,\r\nso they didn\'t ketch you. How did you get along? We was dreadfully\r\nuneasy about you?"\r\n\r\nLouis then told them of the kindness of the colored people, his\r\nthrilling adventures, and hair-breadth escapes, and unfolded to them his\r\nplans for the future.\r\n\r\nCamilla listened with deep interest, and turning to Minnie, who had left\r\nthe peaceful sunshine of her mother\'s home to dwell in the midst of that\r\nrough and rude state of society, she said, "I cannot help feeling sad to\r\nsee you exposing yourself to the dangers that lay around your path. The\r\nfew Southern women who have been faithful to the flag have had a sad\r\nexperience since the war. We have been ostracized and abused, and often\r\nour husbands have been brutally murdered, in a number of instances when\r\nthey were faithful to the dear old flag. A friend of mine, who was an\r\nangel of mercy to the Union prisoners, dressing their wounds and\r\ncarrying them relief, had a dear son, who always kept a Union flag at\r\nhome, which he regarded with almost religious devotion. This made him a\r\nmarked boy in the community, and during the war he was so cruelly\r\nbeaten, by some young rebels, that he never recovered, and colored women\r\nwho would wend their way under the darkness and cover of night to aid\r\nour suffering soldiers, were in danger of being flogged, if detected,\r\nand I understand that one did receive 75 lashes for such an offence, and\r\nI heard of another who was shot down like a dog, for giving bread to a\r\nprisoner, who said, \'Mammy, I am starving.\' I think, (but I have no\r\nright to dictate to you) had I been you, and my home in the North, that\r\nI would have preferred staying there, where, to say the least, you could\r\nhave had pleasanter social relations. You and Louis are nearer the\r\nwhite race than the colored. Why should you prefer the one to the\r\nother?"\r\n\r\n"Because," said Minnie, "the prejudices of society are so strong against\r\nthe people with whom I am connected on my mother\'s side, that I could\r\nnot associate with white people on equal terms, without concealing my\r\norigin, and that I scorned to do. The first years of my life passed\r\nwithout my knowing that I was connected with the colored race; but when\r\nit was revealed to me by mother, who suddenly claimed me, at first I\r\nshrank from the social ostracism to which that knowledge doomed me, and\r\nit was some time before I was reconciled to the change. Oh, there are\r\nlessons of life that we never learn in the bowers of ease. They must be\r\nlearned in the fire. For months life seemed to me a dull, sad thing, and\r\nfor a while I did not care whether I lived or died, the sunshine had\r\nsuddenly faded from my path, and the future looked so dark and\r\ncheerless. But now, when I look back upon those days of gloom and\r\nsuffering, I think they were among the most fruitful of my life, for in\r\nthose days of pain and sorrow my resolution was formed to join the\r\nfortunes of my mother\'s race, and I resolved to brighten her old age\r\nwith a joy, with a gladness she had never known in her youth. And how\r\ncould I have done that had I left her unrecognized and palmed myself\r\nupon society as a white woman? And to tell you the truth, having passed\r\nmost of my life in white society, I did not feel that the advantages of\r\nthat society would have ever paid me for the loss of my self-respect, by\r\npassing as white, when I knew that I was colored; when I knew that any\r\nsociety, however cultivated, wealthy or refined, would not be a social\r\ngain to me, if my color and not my character must be my passport of\r\nadmission. So, when I found out that I was colored, I made up my mind\r\nthat I would neither be pitied nor patronized by my former friends; but\r\nthat I would live out my own individuality and do for my race, as a\r\ncolored woman, what I never could accomplish as a white woman."\r\n\r\n"I think I understand you," said Camilla; "and although I tremble for\r\nyou in the present state, yet you cannot do better than live out the\r\nearnest purpose of your life. I feel that we owe a great debt to the\r\ncolored race, and I would aid and not hinder any hand that is ready to\r\nhelp do the needed work. I have felt for many years that slavery was\r\nwrong, and I am glad, from the bottom of my heart, that it has at last\r\nbeen destroyed. And what are your plans, Louis?"\r\n\r\n"We are going to open a school, and devote our lives to the upbuilding\r\nof the future race. I intend entering into some plan to facilitate the\r\nfreedmen in obtaining homes of their own. I want to see this newly\r\nenfranchised race adding its quota to the civilization of the land. I\r\nbelieve there is power and capacity, only let it have room for exercise\r\nand development. We demand no social equality, no supremacy of power.\r\nAll we ask is that the American people will take their Christless,\r\nGodless prejudices out of the way, and give us a chance to grow, an\r\nopportunity to accept life, not merely as a matter of ease and\r\nindulgence, but of struggle, conquest, and achievement."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Camilla, "what you want and what the nation should be just\r\nenough to grant you is fair play."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is what we want; to be known by our character, and not by our\r\ncolor; to be permitted to take whatever position in society we are\r\nfitted to fill. We do not want to be bolstered and propped up on the one\r\nhand, nor to be crushed and trampled down on the other."\r\n\r\n"Well, Louis, I think that we are coming to that. No, I cannot feel that\r\nall this baptism of fire and blood through which we have passed has been\r\nin vain. Slavery, as an institution, has been destroyed. Slavery, as an\r\nidea, still lives, but I believe that we shall outgrow this spirit of\r\ncaste and proscription which still tarnishes our civilization, both\r\nNorth and South."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter spending a few weeks with Camilla, Louis resolved to settle in the\r\ntown of L----n, and as soon as he had chosen his home and made\r\narrangements for the future, he sent for Ellen, and in a few days she\r\njoined her dear children, as she called Louis and Minnie. Very pleasant\r\nwere the relations between Minnie and the newly freed people.\r\n\r\nShe had found her work, and they had found their friend. She did not\r\ncontent herself with teaching them mere knowledge of books. She felt\r\nthat if the race would grow in the right direction, it must plant the\r\nroots of progress under the hearthstone. She had learned from Anna those\r\nwomanly arts that give beauty, strength and grace to the fireside, and\r\nit was her earnest desire to teach them how to make their homes bright\r\nand happy.\r\n\r\nLouis, too, with his practical turn of mind, used his influence in\r\nteaching them to be saving and industrious, and to turn their attention\r\ntowards becoming land owners. He attended their political meetings, not\r\nto array class against class, nor to inflame the passions of either\r\nside. He wanted the vote of the colored people not to express the old\r\nhates and animosities of the plantation, but the new community of\r\ninterests arising from freedom.\r\n\r\nFor awhile the aspect of things looked hopeful. The Reconstruction Act,\r\nby placing the vote in the hands of the colored man, had given him a new\r\nposition. There was a lull in Southern violence. It was a great change\r\nfrom the fetters on his wrist to the ballot in his right hand, and the\r\nuniform testimony of the colored people was, "We are treated better than\r\nwe were before."\r\n\r\nSome of the rebels indulged in the hope that their former slaves would\r\nvote for them, but they were learning the power of combination, and\r\nhaving no political past, they were radical by position, and when\r\nSouthern State after State rolled up its majorities on the radical side,\r\nthen the vials of wrath were poured upon the heads of the colored\r\npeople, and the courage and heroism which might have gained them\r\nrecognition, perhaps, among heathens, made them more obnoxious here.\r\n\r\nStill Louis and Minnie kept on their labors of love; their inner lives\r\ndaily growing stronger and broader, for they learned to lean upon a\r\nstrength greater than their own; and some of the most beautiful lessons\r\nof faith and trust they had ever learned, they were taught in the lowly\r\ncabins of these newly freed people.\r\n\r\nOften would Minnie enter these humble homes and listen patiently to the\r\nold story of wrong and suffering. Sympathizing with their lot, she would\r\ngive them counsel and help when needed. When she was leaving they would\r\nlook after her wistfully, and say,\r\n\r\n"She mighty good; we\'s low down, but she feels for we."\r\n\r\nAnd thus day after day of that earnest life was spent in deeds and words\r\nof love and kindness.\r\n\r\nBut let us enter their pleasant home. Louis has just returned from a\r\njourney to the city, and has brought with him the latest Northern\r\npapers. He is looking rather sober, and Minnie, ready to detect the\r\nleast change of his countenance, is at his side.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter?" Minnie asked, in a tone of deep concern.\r\n\r\n"I am really discouraged."\r\n\r\n"What about?"\r\n\r\n"Look here," said he, handing her the _New York Tribune_. "State after\r\nState has rolled up a majority against negro suffrage. I have been\r\ntrying to persuade our people to vote the Republican ticket, but to-day,\r\nI feel like blushing for the party. They are weakening our hands and\r\nstrengthening those of the rebels."\r\n\r\n"But, Louis, they were not Republicans who gave these majorities against\r\nus."\r\n\r\n"But, darling, if large numbers of these Republicans stayed at home, and\r\nlet the election go by default, the result was just the same. Now every\r\nrebel can throw it in our teeth and say, \'See your great Republican\r\nparty; they refuse to let the negro vote with them, but they force him\r\nupon us. They don\'t do it out of regard to the negro, but only to spite\r\nus.\' I don\'t think, Minnie, that I am much given to gloomy forebodings,\r\nbut I see from the temper and actions of these rebels, that they are\r\nencouraged and emboldened by these tidings from the North, and to-day\r\nthey are turning people out of work for voting the radical ticket. A\r\nwhile ago they tried flattery and cajolery. You could hear it on almost\r\nevery side--\'We are the best friends of the colored people.\' Appeals\r\nwere made to the memories of the past; how they hunted and played\r\ntogether, and searched for birds\' nests in the rotten peach trees, and\r\nwhen the colored people were not to be caught by such chaff, some were\r\ntrying to force them into submission by intimidation and starvation."\r\n\r\nJust then a knock was heard at the door, and a dark man entered. There\r\nwas nothing in his appearance that showed any connection with the white\r\nrace. There was a tone of hopefulness in his speech, though his face\r\nwore a somewhat anxious expression.\r\n\r\n"Good morning, Mr. Jackson," said Louis, for, in deference to their\r\nfeelings he had dropped the "aunt" and "uncle" of bygone days.\r\n\r\n"Good morning," replied the man, while a pleasant smile flitted over his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n"How does the world use you?" said Louis.\r\n\r\n"Well, times are rather bilious with me, but I am beginning to pick up a\r\nlittle. I get a few boots and shoes to mend. I always used to go to the\r\nmountains, and get plenty of work to do; but this year they wouldn\'t\r\ngive me the situation because I had joined the radicals."\r\n\r\n"What a shame," said Louis; "these men who have always had their rights\r\nof citizenship, seem to know so little of the claims of justice and\r\nhumanity, that they are ready to brow-beat and intimidate these people\r\nfor voting according to their best interests. And what saddens me most\r\nis to see so many people of the North clasping hands with these rebels\r\nand traitors, and to hear it repeated that these people are too ignorant\r\nto vote."\r\n\r\n"Ignorant as they are," said Minnie, "during the war they knew more than\r\ntheir masters; for they knew how to be true to their country, when their\r\nmasters were false to it, and rallied around the flag, when they were\r\ntrampling it under foot, and riddling it with bullets."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said uncle Richard, "I knows them of old. Last week some of them\r\noffered me $500 if I would desert my party; but I wasn\'t going to\r\nforsake my people. I have been in purty tight places this year. One\r\nnight when I come home my little girl said to me, \'Daddy, dere ain\'t no\r\nbread in de house.\' Now, that jist got me, but I begun to pray, and the\r\nnext day I found a quarter of a dollar, and then some of my colored\r\nfriends said it wouldn\'t do to let uncle Jack starve, and they made me\r\nup seventy-five cents. My wife sometimes gets out of heart, but she\r\ndon\'t see very far off."\r\n\r\n"I wish," said Louis, after Mr. Jackson had left, "that some of our\r\nNorthern men would only see the heroism of that simple-minded man. Here\r\nhe stands facing an uncertain future, no longer young in years, stripped\r\nby slavery, his wife not in full sympathy with him, and yet with what\r\ncourage he refused the bribe."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Minnie, "$500 means a great deal for a man landless and\r\npoor, with no assured support for the future. It means a comfortable\r\nfire when the blasts of winter are roving around your home; it means\r\nbread for the little ones, and medicine for the sick child, and little\r\nstart in life."\r\n\r\n"But on the other hand," said Louis, "it meant betrayal of the interests\r\nof his race, and I honor the faithfulness which shook his hands from\r\nreceiving the bribe and clasping hands politically with his life-long\r\noppressors. And I asked myself the question while he was telling his\r\nstory, which hand was the better custodian of the ballot, the white\r\nhand that offered the bribe or the black one that refused it. I think\r\nthe time will come when some of the Anglo Saxon race will blush to\r\nremember that when they were trailing the banner of freedom in the dust\r\nblack men were grasping it with earnest hands, bearing it aloft amid\r\npersecution, pain, and death."\r\n\r\n"Louis" said Minnie very seriously, "I think the nation makes one great\r\nmistake in settling this question of suffrage. It seems to me that\r\neverything gets settled on a partial basis. When they are reconstructing\r\nthe government why not lay the whole foundation anew, and base the right\r\nof suffrage not on the claims of service or sex, but on the broader\r\nbasis of our common humanity."\r\n\r\n"Because, Minnie, we are not prepared for it. This hour belongs to the\r\nnegro."\r\n\r\n"But, Louis, is it not the negro woman\'s hour also? Has she not as many\r\nrights and claims as the negro man?"\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps she has, but, darling, you cannot better the condition of\r\nthe colored men without helping the colored women. What elevates him\r\nhelps her."\r\n\r\n"All that may be true, but I cannot recognize that the negro man is the\r\nonly one who has pressing claims at this hour. To-day our government\r\nneeds woman\'s conscience as well as man\'s judgment. And while I would\r\nnot throw a straw in the way of the colored man, even though I know that\r\nhe would vote against me as soon as he gets his vote, yet I do think\r\nthat woman should have some power to defend herself from oppression, and\r\nequal laws as if she were a man."\r\n\r\n"But, really, I should not like to see you wending your way through\r\nrough and brawling mobs to the polls."\r\n\r\n"Because these mobs are rough and coarse I would have women vote. I\r\nwould soften the asperity of the mobs, and bring into our politics a\r\ndeeper and broader humanity. When I see intemperance send its floods of\r\nruin and shame to the homes of men, and pass by the grog-shops that are\r\nconstantly grinding out their fearful grist of poverty, ruin and death,\r\nI long for the hour when woman\'s vote will be levelled against these\r\ncharnel houses; and have, I hope, the power to close them throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of the land."\r\n\r\n"Why darling," said Louis, gazing admiringly upon the earnest enthusiasm\r\nlighting up her face, "I shall begin to believe that you are a\r\nstrong-minded woman."\r\n\r\n"Surely, you would not have me a weak-minded woman in these hours of\r\ntrial."\r\n\r\n"But, darling, I did not think that you were such an advocate for\r\nwomen\'s voting."\r\n\r\n"I think, Louis, that basing our rights on the ground of our common\r\nhumanity is the only true foundation for national peace and durability.\r\nIf you would have the government strong and enduring you should entrench\r\nit in the hearts of both the men and women of the land."\r\n\r\n"I think you are right in that remark," said Louis. And thus their\r\nevenings were enlivened by pleasant and interesting conversations upon\r\nthe topics of the day.\r\n\r\nOnce when a union friend was spending an evening at their home Louis\r\nentered, looking somewhat animated, and Minnie ever ready to detect his\r\nmoods and feelings, wanted to know what had happened.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have been to a wedding since I left home."\r\n\r\n"And pray who was married?"\r\n\r\n"Guess."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whom to guess. One of our friends?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Was it Mr. Welland?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And who did he marry? Is she a Northern woman, and a staunch unionist?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I can\'t imagine who she can be."\r\n\r\n"Why he married Miss Henson, who sent you those beautiful flowers."\r\n\r\n"Why, Louis, is it possible? Why she is a colored woman."\r\n\r\n"I know."\r\n\r\n"But how came he to marry her?"\r\n\r\n"For the same reason I married you, because he loved her?"\r\n\r\n"Well," said the union man, who sat quietly listening, "I am willing to\r\ngive to the colored people every right that I possess myself, but as to\r\nintermarrying with them, I am not prepared for that."\r\n\r\n"I think," said Louis, "that marrying and social equality among the\r\nraces will simply regulate itself. I do not think under the present\r\ncondition of things that there will be any general intermarrying of the\r\nraces, but this idea of rooted antagonism of races to me is all\r\nmoonshine. I believe that what you call the instincts of race are only\r\nthe prejudices which are the result of custom and education, and if\r\nthere is any instinct in the matter it is rather the instinct of nature\r\nto make a Semi-tropical race in a Semi-tropical climate. Welland told me\r\nthat he had met his wife when she was a slave, that he loved her then,\r\nand would have bought her had it been in his power, but now that freedom\r\nhad come to her he was glad to have the privilege of making her his\r\nwife. He is an Englishman by birth and he intends taking her home with\r\nhim to England when a favorable opportunity presents itself. And that is\r\nfar more honorable and manly than living together after the old order of\r\nthings. I think," said Louis facing the floor "that a cruel wrong was\r\ndone to Minnie and myself when life was given to us under conditions\r\nthat doomed us to hopeless slavery, and from which we were rescued only\r\nby good fortune. I have heard some colored persons boasting of the white\r\nblood, but I always feel like blushing for mine. Much as my father did\r\nfor me he could never atone for giving me life under the conditions he\r\ndid."\r\n\r\n"Never mind," said Minnie, "it all turned out for the best."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Darling," said Louis, growing calmer, "for it gave me you. And\r\nthat was life\'s compensation. But the question of the intermingling of\r\nthe races in marriage is one that scarcely interests this question. The\r\nquestion that presses upon us with the most fearful distinctness is how\r\ncan we make life secure in the South. I sometimes feel as if the very\r\nair was busting with bayonets. There is no law here but the revolver.\r\nThere must be a screw loose somewhere, and this government that taxes\r\nits men in peace and drafts them in war, ought to be wise enough to know\r\nits citizens and strong enough to protect them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the pleasant home-life of Louis and Minnie was destined to be rudely\r\nbroken up. He began to receive threats and anonymous letters, such as\r\nthese: "Louis Lecroix, you are a doomed man. We are determined to\r\ntolerate no scalawags, nor carpetbaggers among us. Beware, the sacred\r\nserpent has hissed."\r\n\r\nBut Louis, brave and resolute, kept on the even tenor of his way,\r\nalthough he never left his home without some forebodings that he tried\r\nin vain to cast off. But his young wife being less in contact with the\r\nbrutal elements of society in that sin-cursed region, did not comprehend\r\nthe danger as Louis did, and yet she could not help feeling anxious for\r\nher husband\'s safety.\r\n\r\nThey never parted without her looking after him with a sigh, and then\r\nturning to her school, or whatever work or reading she had on her hand,\r\nshe would strive to suppress her heart\'s forebodings. But the storm\r\nabout to burst and to darken forever the sunshine of that home was\r\ndestined to fall on that fair young head.\r\n\r\nImperative business called Louis from home for one night. Minnie stood\r\nat the door and said, "Louis, I hate to have you go. I have been feeling\r\nso badly here lately, as if something was going to happen. Come home as\r\nsoon as you can."\r\n\r\n"I will, darling," he said, kissing her tenderly again and again. "I do\r\nfeel rather loath to leave you, but death is every where, always lurking\r\nin ambush. A man may escape from an earthquake to be strangled by a\r\nhair. So, darling, keep in good spirits till I come."\r\n\r\nMinnie stood at the door watching him till he was out of sight, and then\r\nturning to her mother with a sigh, she said, "What a wretched state of\r\nsociety. When he goes I never feel easy till he returns. I do wish we\r\nhad a government under which our lives would be just as safe as they\r\nwere in Pennsylvania."\r\n\r\nEllen felt very anxious, but she tried to hide her disquietude and keep\r\nMinnie\'s spirits from sinking, and so she said, "This is a hard country.\r\nWe colored people have seen our hard times here."\r\n\r\n"But, mother, don\'t you sometimes feel bitter towards these people, who\r\nhave treated you so unkindly?"\r\n\r\n"No, Minnie; I used to, but I don\'t now. God says we must forgive, and\r\nif we don\'t forgive, He won\'t forgive."\r\n\r\n"But, mother, how did you get to feeling so?"\r\n\r\n"Why, honey, I used to suffer until my heart was almost ready to burst,\r\nbut I learned to cast my burden on the Lord, and then my misery all\r\npassed away. My burden fell off at the foot of the cross, and I felt\r\nthat my feet were planted on a rock."\r\n\r\n"How wonderful," said Minnie, "is this faith! How real it is to them!\r\nHow near some of these suffering people have drawn to God!"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ellen, "Mrs. Sumpter had a colored woman, to whom they were\r\nreal mean and cruel, and one day they whipped her and beat her on her\r\nfeet to keep her from running away; but she made up her mind to leave,\r\nand so she packed up her clothes to run away. But before she started, I\r\nbelieve she kneeled down and prayed, and asked what she should do, and\r\nsomething reasoned with her and said, \'Stand still and see what I am\r\ngoing to do for you,\' and so she unpacked her clothes and stayed, and\r\nnow the best part of it was this, Milly\'s son had been away, and he\r\ncame back and brought with him money enough to buy his mother; for he\r\nhad been out begging money to buy her, and so Milly got free, and she\r\nwas mighty glad that she had stayed, because when he\'d come back, if she\r\nhad been gone, he would not have known where to find her."\r\n\r\n"Well, it is wonderful. Somehow these people have passed through the\r\ndarkness and laid their hands on God\'s robe of love and light, and have\r\nbeen sustained. It seems to me that some things they see clearer through\r\ntheir tears."\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Minnie, "As it is Saturday I will visit some of my\r\nscholars."\r\n\r\n"Well, Minnie, I would; you look troubled, and may be you\'ll feel\r\nbetter."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mother, I often feel strengthened after visiting some of these\r\ngood old souls, and getting glimpses into their inner life. I sometimes\r\nask them, after listening to the story of their past wrongs, what has\r\nsustained you? What has kept you up? And the almost invariable answer\r\nhas been the power of God. Some of these poor old souls, who have been\r\nturned adrift to shift for themselves, don\'t live by bread alone; they\r\nlive by bread and faith in God. I asked one of them a few days since,\r\nAre you not afraid of starving? and the answer was, Not while God\r\nlives."\r\n\r\nAfter Minnie left, she visited a number of lowly cabins. The first one\r\nshe entered was the home of an industrious couple who were just making a\r\nstart in life. The room in which Minnie was, had no window-lights, only\r\nan aperture that supplied them with light, but also admitted the cold.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you have window-lights?" said Minnie.\r\n\r\n"Oh we must crawl before we walk;" and yet even in this humble home they\r\nhad taken two orphan children of their race, and were giving them food\r\nand shelter. And this kindness to the orphans of their race Minnie\r\nfound to be a very praiseworthy practice among some of those people who\r\nwere not poorer than themselves.\r\n\r\nThe next cabin she entered was very neat, though it bore evidences of\r\npoverty. The woman, in referring to the past, told her how her child had\r\nbeen taken away when it was about two years old, and how she had lost\r\nall trace of him, and would not know him if he stood in her presence.\r\n\r\n"How did you feel?" said Minnie.\r\n\r\n"I felt as I was going to my grave, but I thought if I wouldn\'t get\r\njustice here, I would get it in another world."\r\n\r\n"My husband," said another, "asked if God is a just God, how would sich\r\nas slavery be, and something answered and said, \'sich shan\'t always be,\'\r\nand you couldn\'t beat it out of my husband\'s head that the Spirit didn\'t\r\nspeak to him."\r\n\r\nAnd thus the morning waned away, and Minnie returned calmer than when\r\nshe had left. A holy peace stole over her mind. She felt that for high\r\nand low, rich and poor, there was a common refuge. That there was no\r\ncorner so dark that the light of heaven could not shine through, and\r\nthat these people in their ignorance and simplicity had learned to look\r\nupon God as a friend coming near to them in their sorrows, and taking\r\ncognizance of their wants and woes.\r\n\r\nMinnie loved to listen to these beautiful stories of faith and trust. To\r\nher they were grand inspirations to faith and duty. Sometimes Minnie\r\nwould think, when listening to some dear aged saint, I can\'t teach these\r\npeople religion, I must learn from them.\r\n\r\nRefreshed and strengthened she returned home and began to work upon a\r\ndress for a destitute and orphaned child, and when night came she\r\nretired quite early, being somewhat wearied with her day\'s work.\r\n\r\nDuring his absence Louis had been among the freedmen in a new\r\nsettlement where he had lately established a school, where,\r\nnotwithstanding all their disadvantages, he was pleased to see evidences\r\nof growth and progress.\r\n\r\nThere was an earnestness and growing manliness that commanded his\r\nrespect. They were beginning to learn the power of combination, and gave\r\nbut little heed to the cajoling words, "We are your best friends."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you think," Louis said to an intelligent freedman, "that the\r\nrebels are your best friends?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think so when I lose my senses."\r\n\r\n"But you are ignorant," Louis said to another one. "How will you know\r\nwhom to vote for?"\r\n\r\n"Well if I don\'t, I know how not to vote for a rebel."\r\n\r\n"How do you know you didn\'t vote for a rebel?" said Louis to another one\r\nwho came from one of the most benighted districts.\r\n\r\n"I voted for one of my own color," as if treason and a black skin were\r\nincompatible.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Louis called the people together, and talked with them,\r\ntrying to keep them from being discouraged, for the times were evil, and\r\nthe days were very gloomy. The impeachment had failed. State after State\r\nin the North had voted against enfranchising the colored man in their\r\nmidst. The spirit of the lost cause revived, murders multiplied. The Ku\r\nKlux spread terror and death around. Every item of Northern meanness to\r\nthe colored people in their midst was a message of hope to the rebel\r\nelement of the South, which had only changed. Ballot and bullet had\r\nfailed, but another resort was found in secret assassination. Men\r\nadvocating equal rights did so at the peril of their lives, for violence\r\nand murder were rampant in the land. Oh those dark and weary days when\r\npoliticians were flattering for place and murdered Union men were\r\nsleeping in their bloody shrouds. Louis\' courage did not desert him, and\r\nhe tried to nerve the hearts of those that were sinking with fear in\r\nthose days of gloom and terror. His advice to the people was, "Defend\r\nyour firesides if they are invaded, live as peaceably as you can, spare\r\nno pains to educate your children, be saving and industrious, try to get\r\nland under your feet and homes over your heads. My faith is very strong\r\nin political parties, but, as the world has outgrown other forms of\r\nwrong, I believe that it will outgrow this also. We must trust and hope\r\nfor better things." What else could he say? And yet there were times when\r\nhis words seemed to him almost like bitter mockery. Here was outrage\r\nupon outrage committed upon these people, and to tell them to hope and\r\nwait for better times, but seemed like speaking hollow words. Oh he\r\nlonged for a central administration strong enough to put down violence\r\nand misrule in the South. If Johnson was clasping hands with rebels and\r\ntraitors was there no power in Congress to give, at least, security to\r\nlife? Must they wait till murder was organized into an institution, and\r\nlife and property were at the mercy of the mob? And, if so, would not\r\nsuch a government be a farce, and such a civilization a failure?\r\n\r\nWith these reflections passing through his mind he fell asleep, but his\r\nslumber was restless and disturbed. He dreamed (but it seemed so plain\r\nto him, that he thought it was hardly a dream,) that Minnie came to his\r\nside and pressed her lips to his, but they were very pale and very cold.\r\nHe reached out his hand to clasp her, but she was gone, but as she\r\nvanished he heard her say, "My husband."\r\n\r\nRestless and uneasy he arose; there was a strange feeling around his\r\nsoul, a great sinking and depression of his spirits. He could not\r\naccount for his feelings. He arose and walked the floor and looked up at\r\nthe heavens, but the night was very bright and beautiful, still he could\r\nnot shake off his strange and sad forebodings, and as soon as it was\r\nlight he started for home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Installment missing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon when the body had been prepared for the grave, the\r\nsorrowing friends gathered around, tearfully noting the look of peace\r\nand rest which had stolen over the pale, dead face, when all traces of\r\nthe death agony had passed away by the contraction of the muscles.\r\n\r\n"That is just the way she looked yesterday," said a sad-eyed woman,\r\nwhose face showed traces of a deep "and fearful sorrow."\r\n\r\nLouis drew near, for he was eager to hear any word that told him of\r\nMinnie before death had robbed her of life, and him of peace. He came\r\nnear enough to hear, but not to interrupt the conversation.\r\n\r\n"She was at my house yesterday, trying to comfort me, when I was telling\r\nher how these Secesh used to _cruelize_ us."\r\n\r\n"I was telling her about my poor daughter Amy, and what a sprightly,\r\npert piece she was, and how dem awful Secesh took my poor chile and\r\nhung\'d her."\r\n\r\n"Hung\'d? Aunt Susan, Oh how was dat?" said half a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see it was jist dis way. My darter Amy was a mighty nice\r\nchile, and Massa could truss her wid any ting. So when de Linkum Sogers\r\nhad gone through dis place, Massa got her to move some of his tings over\r\nto another place. Now when Amy seed de sojers had cum\'d through she was\r\nmighty glad, and she said in a kine of childish way, \'I\'se so glad, I\'m\r\ngwine to marry a Linkum soger, and set up house-keeping for myself.\' I\r\ndon\'t spect she wer in arnest \'bout marrying de sojer, but she did want\r\nher freedom. Well, no body couldn\'t blame her for dat, for freedom\'s a\r\nmighty good thing."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like it, I jist loves it," said one of Aunt Sue\'s auditors.\r\n\r\n"And I does too, \'cause I\'d rather live on bread and water than be back\r\nagain in de old place, but go on, Aunt Susan."\r\n\r\n"Well, when she said dat, dat miserable old Heston----"\r\n\r\n"Heston, I know dat wretch, I bound de debil\'s waiting for him now, got\r\nhis pitch fork all ready."\r\n\r\n"Well, he had my poor girl tookened up, and poor chile, she was beat\r\nshameful, and den dey had her up before der sogers and had her tried for\r\nsaying \'cendiary words, and den dey had my poor girl hung\'d." And the\r\npoor old woman bowed her head and rocked her body to and fro.\r\n\r\n"Well," she continued after a moment\'s pause, "I was telling dat sweet\r\nangel dere my trouble, and she was mighty sorry, and sat dere and cried,\r\nand den she said, \'Mrs. Thomas, I hope in a better world dat you\'ll see\r\na joy according to all the days wherein you have seen sorrow!\' Bless her\r\nsweet heart, she\'s got in de shining gate afore me, but I bound to meet\r\nher on de sunny banks of deliberance.\r\n\r\n"And she was at my house yesterday," said another. "She cum\'d to see if\r\nI wanted any ting, and I tell\'d her I would like to hab a little\r\nflannel, \'cause I had the rheumatiz so bad, and she said I should hab\r\nit. Den she asked me if I didn\'t like freedom best. I told her I would\r\nrather live in a corn crib, and so I would. It is hard getting along,\r\nbut I hopes for better times. And den she took down de Bible, and read\r\nwid dat sweet voice of hers, about de eagle stirring up her nest, and\r\nden she said when de old eagle wanted her young to fly she broked up de\r\nnest, and de little eagles didn\'t known what was de matter, but some how\r\ndey didn\'t feel so cumfertable, \'cause de little twigs and sticks stuck\r\nin \'em, and den dey would work dere wings, and dat was de way she said\r\nwe must do; de ole nest of slavery was broke up, but she said we mus\'n\'t\r\nget discouraged, but we must plume our wings for higher flying. Oh she\r\ndid tell it so purty. I wish I could say it like she did, it did my\r\nheart so much good. Poor thing, she done gone and folded her wing in de\r\nhebenly mansion. I wish I was \'long side of her, but I\'se bound to meet\r\nher, \'cause I\'m gwine to set out afresh for heben and \'ternal glory."\r\n\r\nAnd thus did these stricken children of sorrow unconsciously comfort the\r\ndesolate and almost breaking heart of Louis Lacroix. And their words of\r\nlove and hope were like rays of light shimmering amid the gloomy shadows\r\nthat overhung his suddenly darkened life.\r\n\r\nSurely, thought Louis, if the blessings and tears of the poor and needy\r\nand the prayers of him who was ready to perish would crystalize a path\r\nto the glory-land, then Minnie\'s exit from earth must have been over a\r\nbridge of light, above whose radiant arches hovering angels would\r\ndelight to bend.\r\n\r\nWhile these thoughts were passing through his mind, a knock was heard at\r\nthe door, and Louis rose to open it, and then he saw a sight which shook\r\nall his gathered firmness to tears. Headed by the eldest of Minnie\'s\r\nscholars came a procession of children, each one bearing a bunch of\r\nfairest and brightest flowers to spread around the couch of their\r\nbeloved teacher. Some kissed her, and others threw themselves beside the\r\ncorpse and wept bitter, burning tears. All shared in Louis\' grief, for\r\nall had lost a dear, good friend and loving instructor.\r\n\r\nLouis summoned all the energies of his soul to bear his mournful loss.\r\nIt was his task to bow to the Chastener, and let his loved one go,\r\nfeeling that when he had laid her in the earth that he left her there in\r\nthe hope of a better resurrection.\r\n\r\nLife with its solemn responsibilities still met him; its earnest duties\r\nstill confronted him, and, though he sometimes felt like a weary watcher\r\nat the gates of death, longing to catch a glimpse of her shining robes\r\nand the radiant light of her glorified face, yet her knew it was his\r\nwork to labor and to wait.\r\n\r\nSorrow and danger still surrounded his way, and he felt his soul more\r\nstrongly drawn out than ever to share the fortunes of the colored race.\r\nHe felt there were grand possibilities stored up in their future. The\r\nname of the negro had been associated with slavery, ignorance and\r\npoverty, and he determined as far as his influence could be exerted to\r\nlift that name from the dust of the centuries and place it among the\r\nmost honored names in the history of the human race.\r\n\r\nHe still remained in the South, for Minnie\'s grave had made the South to\r\nhim a sacred place, a place in which to labor and to wait until peace\r\nlike bright dew should descend where carnage had spread ruin around, and\r\nfreedom and justice, like glorified angels, should reign triumphant\r\nwhere violence and slavery had held their fearful carnival of shame and\r\ncrime for ages. Earnestly he set himself to bring around the hour when\r\n\r\n  Peace, white-robed and pure, should move\r\n    O\'er rifts of ruin deep and wide,\r\n  When her hands should span with lasting love\r\n    The chasms rent by hate and pride.\r\n\r\nAnd he was blessed in his labors of love and faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, in conclusion, may I not ask the indulgence of my readers for a\r\nfew moments, simply to say that Louis and Minnie are only ideal beings,\r\ntouched here and there with a coloring from real life?\r\n\r\nBut while I confess (not wishing to mis-represent the most lawless of\r\nthe Ku-Klux) that Minnie has only lived and died in my imagination, may\r\nI not modestly ask that the lesson of Minnie shall have its place among\r\nthe educational ideas for the advancement of our race?\r\n\r\nThe greatest want of our people, if I understand our wants aright, is\r\nnot simply wealth, nor genius, nor mere intelligence, but live men, and\r\nearnest, lovely women, whose lives shall represent not a "stagnant mass,\r\nbut a living force."\r\n\r\nWe have wealth among us, but how much of it is ever spent in building up\r\nthe future of the race? in encouraging talent, and developing genius? We\r\nhave intelligence, but how much do we add to the reservoir of the\r\nworld\'s thought? We have genius among us, but how much can it rely upon\r\nthe colored race for support?\r\n\r\nTake even the _Christian Recorder_; where are the graduates from\r\ncolleges and high school whose pens and brains lend beauty, strength,\r\ngrace and culture to its pages?\r\n\r\nIf, when their school days are over, the last composition shall have\r\nbeen given at the examination, will not the disused faculties revenge\r\nthemselves by rusting? If I could say it without being officious and\r\nintrusive, I would say to some who are about to graduate this year, do\r\nnot feel that your education is finished, when the diploma of your\r\ninstitution is in your hands. Look upon the knowledge you have gained\r\nonly as a stepping stone to a future, which you are determined shall\r\ngrandly contrast with the past.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the authors of the present day have been weaving their\r\nstories about white men marrying beautiful quadroon girls, who, in so\r\ndoing were lost to us socially, I conceived of one of that same class to\r\nwhom I gave a higher, holier destiny; a life of lofty self-sacrifice and\r\nbeautiful self-consecration, finished at the post of duty, and rounded\r\noff with the fiery crown of martyrdom, a circlet which ever changes into\r\na diadem of glory.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of Minnie\'s sacrifice is this, that it is braver to suffer\r\nwith one\'s own branch of the human race,--to feel, that the weaker and\r\nthe more despised they are, the closer we will cling to them, for the\r\nsake of helping them, than to attempt to creep out of all identity with\r\nthem in their feebleness, for the sake of mere personal advantages, and\r\nto do this at the expense of self-respect, and a true manhood, and a\r\ntruly dignified womanhood, that with whatever gifts we possess, whether\r\nthey be genius, culture, wealth or social position, we can best serve\r\nthe interests of our race by a generous and loving diffusion, than by a\r\nnarrow and selfish isolation which, after all, is only one type of the\r\nbarbarous and anti-social state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n1.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n\r\n'
