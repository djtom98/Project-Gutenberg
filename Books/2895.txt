FOLLOWING THE EQUATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA man may have no bad habits and have worse.\r\n                             --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of this lecturing-trip around the world was Paris,\r\nwhere we had been living a year or two.\r\n\r\nWe sailed for America, and there made certain preparations.  This took\r\nbut little time.  Two members of my family elected to go with me.  Also a\r\ncarbuncle.  The dictionary says a carbuncle is a kind of jewel.  Humor is\r\nout of place in a dictionary.\r\n\r\nWe started westward from New York in midsummer, with Major Pond to manage\r\nthe platform-business as far as the Pacific.  It was warm work, all the\r\nway, and the last fortnight of it was suffocatingly smoky, for in Oregon\r\nand British Columbia the forest fires were raging.  We had an added week\r\nof smoke at the seaboard, where we were obliged to wait awhile for our\r\nship.\r\nShe had been getting herself ashore in the smoke, and she had to be\r\ndocked\r\nAnd repaired. We sailed at last; and so ended a snail-paced march across\r\nthe continent, which had lasted forty days.\r\n\r\nWe moved westward about mid-afternoon over a rippled and sparkling summer\r\nsea; an enticing sea, a clean and cool sea, and apparently a welcome sea\r\nto all on board; it certainly was to me, after the distressful dustings\r\nand smokings and swelterings of the past weeks.  The voyage would furnish\r\na three-weeks holiday, with hardly a break in it.  We had the whole\r\nPacific Ocean in\r\nfront of us, with nothing to do but do nothing and be comfortable.  The\r\ncity of Victoria was twinkling dim in the deep heart of her smoke-cloud,\r\nand getting ready to vanish and now we closed the field-glasses and sat\r\ndown on our steamer chairs contented and at peace.  But they went to\r\nwreck and ruin under us and brought us to shame before all the\r\npassengers.  They had been furnished by the largest furniture-dealing\r\nhouse in Victoria, and were worth a couple of farthings a dozen, though\r\nthey had cost us the price of honest chairs.  In the Pacific and Indian\r\nOceans one must still bring his own deck-chair on board or go without,\r\njust as in the old forgotten Atlantic times--those Dark Ages of sea\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nOurs was a reasonably comfortable ship, with the customary sea-going fare\r\n--plenty of good food furnished by the Deity and cooked by the devil.\r\nThe discipline observable on board was perhaps as good as it is anywhere\r\nin the Pacific and Indian Oceans.  The ship was not very well arranged\r\nfor tropical service; but that is nothing, for this is the rule for ships\r\nwhich ply in the tropics.  She had an over-supply of cockroaches, but\r\nthis is also the rule with ships doing business in the summer seas--at\r\nleast such as have been long in service.  Our young captain was a very\r\nhandsome man, tall and perfectly formed, the very figure to show up a\r\nsmart uniform's finest effects.  He was a man of the best intentions and\r\nwas polite and courteous even to courtliness.  There was a soft grace and\r\nfinish about his manners which made whatever place he happened to be in\r\nseem for the moment a drawing room.  He avoided the smoking room.  He had\r\nno vices.  He did not smoke or chew tobacco or take snuff; he did not\r\nswear, or use slang or rude, or coarse, or indelicate language, or make\r\npuns, or tell anecdotes, or laugh intemperately, or raise his voice above\r\nthe moderate pitch enjoined by the canons of good form. When he gave an\r\norder, his manner modified it into a request.  After dinner he and his\r\nofficers joined the ladies and gentlemen in the ladies' saloon, and\r\nshared in the singing and piano playing, and helped turn the music.  He\r\nhad a sweet and sympathetic tenor voice, and used it with taste and\r\neffect. After the music he played whist there, always with the same\r\npartner\r\nand opponents, until the ladies' bedtime.  The electric lights burned\r\nthere\r\nas late as the ladies and their friends might desire; but they were not\r\nallowed to burn in the smoking-room after eleven.  There were many laws\r\non the ship's statute book of course; but so far as I could see, this and\r\none other were the only ones that were rigidly enforced.  The captain\r\nexplained that he enforced this one because his own cabin adjoined the\r\nsmoking-room, and the smell of tobacco smoke made him sick.  I did not\r\nsee how our smoke could reach him, for the smoking-room and his cabin\r\nwere on the upper deck, targets for all the winds that blew; and besides\r\nthere was no crack of communication between them, no opening of any sort\r\nin the solid intervening bulkhead.  Still, to a delicate stomach even\r\nimaginary smoke can convey damage.\r\n\r\nThe captain, with his gentle nature, his polish, his sweetness, his moral\r\nand verbal purity, seemed pathetically out of place in his rude and\r\nautocratic vocation.  It seemed another instance of the irony of fate.\r\n\r\nHe was going home under a cloud.  The passengers knew about his trouble,\r\nand were sorry for him.  Approaching Vancouver through a narrow and\r\ndifficult passage densely befogged with smoke from the forest fires, he\r\nhad had the ill-luck to lose his bearings and get his ship on the rocks.\r\nA matter like this would rank merely as an error with you and me; it\r\nranks as a crime with the directors of steamship companies.  The captain\r\nhad been tried by the Admiralty Court at Vancouver, and its verdict had\r\nacquitted him of blame.  But that was insufficient comfort.  A sterner\r\ncourt would examine the case in Sydney--the Court of Directors, the lords\r\nof a company in whose ships the captain had served as mate a number of\r\nyears.  This was his first voyage as captain.\r\n\r\nThe officers of our ship were hearty and companionable young men, and\r\nthey entered into the general amusements and helped the passengers pass\r\nthe time.  Voyages in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are but pleasure\r\nexcursions for all hands.  Our purser was a young Scotchman who was\r\nequipped with a grit that was remarkable.  He was an invalid, and looked\r\nit, as far as his body was concerned, but illness could not subdue his\r\nspirit.  He was full of life, and had a gay and capable tongue.  To all\r\nappearances he was a sick man without being aware of it, for he did not\r\ntalk about his ailments, and his bearing and conduct were those of a\r\nperson in robust health; yet he was the prey, at intervals, of ghastly\r\nsieges of pain in his heart.  These lasted many hours, and while the\r\nattack continued he could neither sit nor lie.  In one instance he stood\r\non his feet twenty-four hours fighting for his life with these sharp\r\nagonies, and yet was as full of life and cheer and activity\r\nthe next day as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nThe brightest passenger in the ship, and the most interesting and\r\nfelicitous talker, was a young Canadian who was not able to let the\r\nwhisky bottle alone. He was of a rich and powerful family, and could have\r\nhad a distinguished career and abundance of effective help toward it if\r\nhe could have conquered his appetite for drink; but he could not do it,\r\nso his great equipment of talent was of no use to him. He had often taken\r\nthe pledge to drink no more, and was a good sample of what that sort of\r\nunwisdom can do for a man--for a man with anything short of an iron will.\r\nThe system is wrong in two ways: it does not strike at the root of the\r\ntrouble, for one thing, and to make a pledge of any kind is to declare\r\nwar against nature; for a pledge is a chain that is always clanking and\r\nreminding the wearer of it that he is not a free man.\r\n\r\nI have said that the system does not strike at the root of the trouble,\r\nand I venture to repeat that. The root is not the drinking, but the\r\ndesire to drink.  These are very different things.  The one merely\r\nrequires will--and a great deal of it, both as to bulk and staying\r\ncapacity--the other merely requires watchfulness--and for no long time.\r\nThe desire of course precedes the act, and should have one's first\r\nattention; it can do but little good to refuse the act over and over\r\nagain, always leaving the desire unmolested, unconquered; the desire will\r\ncontinue to assert itself, and will be almost sure to win in the long\r\nrun.  When the desire intrudes, it should be at once banished out of the\r\nmind.  One should be on the watch for it all the time--otherwise it will\r\nget in.  It must be taken in time and not allowed to get a lodgment.  A\r\ndesire constantly repulsed for a fortnight should die, then.  That should\r\ncure the drinking habit.  The system of refusing the mere act of\r\ndrinking, and leaving the desire in full force, is unintelligent war\r\ntactics, it seems to me.  I used to take pledges--and soon violate them.\r\nMy will was not strong, and I could not help it.  And then, to be tied in\r\nany way naturally irks an otherwise free person and makes him chafe in\r\nhis bonds and want to get his liberty.  But when I finally ceased from\r\ntaking definite pledges, and merely resolved that I would kill an\r\ninjurious desire, but leave myself free to resume the desire and the\r\nhabit whenever I should choose to do so, I had no more trouble.  In five\r\ndays I drove out the desire to smoke and was not obliged to keep watch\r\nafter that; and I never experienced any strong desire to smoke again.  At\r\nthe end of a year and a quarter of idleness I began to write a book, and\r\npresently found that the pen was strangely reluctant to go.  I tried a\r\nsmoke to see if that would help me out of the difficulty.  It did.  I\r\nsmoked eight or ten cigars and as many pipes a day for five months;\r\nfinished the book, and did not smoke again until a year had gone by and\r\nanother book had to be begun.\r\n\r\nI can quit any of my nineteen injurious habits at any time, and without\r\ndiscomfort or inconvenience.  I think that the Dr. Tanners and those\r\nothers who go forty days without eating do it by resolutely keeping out\r\nthe desire to eat, in the beginning, and that after a few hours the\r\ndesire is discouraged and comes no more.\r\n\r\nOnce I tried my scheme in a large medical way.  I had been confined to my\r\nbed several days with lumbago.  My case refused to improve.  Finally the\r\ndoctor said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy remedies have no fair chance.  Consider what they have to fight,\r\nbesides the lumbago.  You smoke extravagantly, don't you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take coffee immoderately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd some tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou eat all kinds of things that are dissatisfied with each other's\r\ncompany?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou drink two hot Scotches every night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, there you see what I have to contend against.  We can't make\r\nprogress the way the matter stands.  You must make a reduction in these\r\nthings; you must cut down your consumption of them considerably for some\r\ndays.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can't, doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy can't you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI lack the will-power.  I can cut them off entirely, but I can't merely\r\nmoderate them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said that that would answer, and said he would come around in\r\ntwenty-four hours and begin work again.  He was taken ill himself and\r\ncould not come; but I did not need him.  I cut off all those things for\r\ntwo days and nights; in fact, I cut off all kinds of food, too, and all\r\ndrinks except water, and at the end of the forty-eight hours the lumbago\r\nwas discouraged and left me.  I was a well man; so I gave thanks and took\r\nto those delicacies again.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a valuable medical course, and I recommended it to a lady.  She\r\nhad run down and down and down, and had at last reached a point where\r\nmedicines no longer had any helpful effect upon her.  I said I knew I\r\ncould put her upon her feet in a week.  It brightened her up, it filled\r\nher with hope, and she said she would do everything I told her to do.  So\r\nI said she must stop swearing and drinking, and smoking and eating for\r\nfour days, and then she would be all right again.  And it would have\r\nhappened just so, I know it; but she said she could not stop swearing,\r\nand smoking, and drinking, because she had never done those things.  So\r\nthere it was.  She had neglected her habits, and hadn't any.  Now that\r\nthey would have come good, there were none in stock.  She had nothing to\r\nfall back on.  She was a sinking vessel, with no freight in her to throw\r\noverboard and lighten ship withal.  Why, even one or two little bad\r\nhabits\r\ncould have saved her, but she was just a moral pauper. When she could\r\nhave\r\nacquired them she was dissuaded by her parents, who were ignorant people\r\nthough reared in the best society, and it was too late to begin now.  It\r\nseemed such a pity; but there was no help for it.  These things ought to\r\nbe attended to while a person is young; otherwise, when age and disease\r\ncome, there is nothing effectual to fight them with.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a youth I used to take all kinds of pledges, and do my best to\r\nkeep them, but I never could, because I didn't strike at the root of the\r\nhabit--the desire; I generally broke down within the month.  Once I tried\r\nlimiting a habit.  That worked tolerably well for a while.  I pledged\r\nmyself to smoke but one cigar a day.  I kept the cigar waiting until\r\nbedtime, then I had a luxurious time with it.  But desire persecuted me\r\nevery day and all day long; so, within the week I found myself hunting\r\nfor larger cigars than I had been used to smoke; then larger ones still,\r\nand still larger ones.  Within the fortnight I was getting cigars made\r\nfor me--on a yet larger pattern.  They still grew and grew in size.\r\nWithin the month my cigar had grown to such proportions that I could have\r\nused it as a crutch.  It now seemed to me that a one-cigar limit was no\r\nreal protection to a person, so I knocked my pledge on the head and\r\nresumed my liberty.\r\n\r\nTo go back to that young Canadian.  He was a \xe2\x80\x9cremittance man,\xe2\x80\x9d the first\r\none I had ever seen or heard of.  Passengers explained the term to me.\r\nThey said that dissipated ne'er-do-weels belonging to important families\r\nin England and Canada were not cast off by their people while there was\r\nany hope of reforming them, but when that last hope perished at last, the\r\nne'er-do-weel was sent abroad to get him out of the way.  He was shipped\r\noff with just enough money in his pocket--no, in the purser's pocket--for\r\nthe needs of the voyage--and when he reached his destined port he would\r\nfind a remittance awaiting him there.  Not a large one, but just enough\r\nto keep him a month.  A similar remittance would come monthly thereafter.\r\nIt was the remittance-man's custom to pay his month's board and lodging\r\nstraightway--a duty which his landlord did not allow him to forget--then\r\nspree away the rest of his money in a single night, then brood and mope\r\nand grieve in idleness till the next remittance came.  It is a pathetic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe had other remittance-men on board, it was said.  At least they said\r\nthey were R. M.'s.  There were two.  But they did not resemble the\r\nCanadian; they lacked his tidiness, and his brains, and his gentlemanly\r\nways, and his resolute spirit, and his humanities and generosities.  One\r\nof them was a lad of nineteen or twenty, and he was a good deal of a\r\nruin, as to clothes, and morals, and general aspect.  He said he was a\r\nscion of a ducal house in England, and had been shipped to Canada for the\r\nhouse's relief, that he had fallen into trouble there, and was now being\r\nshipped to Australia.  He said he had no title.  Beyond this remark he\r\nwas economical of the truth.  The first thing he did in Australia was to\r\nget into the lockup, and the next thing he did was to proclaim himself an\r\nearl in the police court in the morning and fail to prove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt, tell the truth.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nAbout four days out from Victoria we plunged into hot weather, and all\r\nthe male passengers put on white linen clothes.  One or two days later we\r\ncrossed the 25th parallel of north latitude, and then, by order, the\r\nofficers of the ship laid away their blue uniforms and came out in white\r\nlinen ones.  All the ladies were in white by this time.  This prevalence\r\nof snowy costumes gave the promenade deck an invitingly cool, and\r\ncheerful and picnicky aspect.\r\n\r\nFrom my diary:\r\n\r\nThere are several sorts of ills in the world from which a person can\r\nnever escape altogether, let him journey as far as he will.  One escapes\r\nfrom one breed of an ill only to encounter another breed of it.  We have\r\ncome far from the snake liar and the fish liar, and there was rest and\r\npeace in the thought; but now we have reached the realm of the boomerang\r\nliar, and sorrow is with us once more.  The first officer has seen a man\r\ntry to escape from his enemy by getting behind a tree; but the enemy sent\r\nhis boomerang sailing into the sky far above and beyond the tree; then it\r\nturned, descended, and killed the man.  The Australian passenger has seen\r\nthis thing done to two men, behind two trees--and by the one arrow.  This\r\nbeing received with a large silence that suggested doubt, he buttressed\r\nit with the statement that his brother once saw the boomerang kill a bird\r\naway off a hundred yards and bring it to the thrower.  But these are ills\r\nwhich must be borne.  There is no other way.\r\n\r\nThe talk passed from the boomerang to dreams--usually a fruitful subject,\r\nafloat or ashore--but this time the output was poor.  Then it passed to\r\ninstances of extraordinary memory--with better results.  Blind Tom, the\r\nnegro pianist, was spoken of, and it was said that he could accurately\r\nplay any piece of music, howsoever long and difficult, after hearing it\r\nonce; and that six months later he could accurately play it again,\r\nwithout having touched it in the interval.  One of the most striking of\r\nthe stories told was furnished by a gentleman who had served on the staff\r\nof the Viceroy of India.  He read the details from his note-book, and\r\nexplained that he had written them down, right after the consummation of\r\nthe incident which they described, because he thought that if he did not\r\nput them down in black and white he might presently come to think he had\r\ndreamed them or invented them.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy was making a progress, and among the shows offered by the\r\nMaharajah of Mysore for his entertainment was a memory-exhibition.\r\nThe Viceroy and thirty gentlemen of his suite sat in a row, and the\r\nmemory-expert, a high-caste Brahmin, was brought in and seated on the\r\nfloor in front of them.  He said he knew but two languages, the English\r\nand his own, but would not exclude any foreign tongue from the tests to\r\nbe applied to his memory.  Then he laid before the assemblage his program\r\n--a sufficiently extraordinary one.  He proposed that one gentleman\r\nshould give him one word of a foreign sentence, and tell him its place in\r\nthe sentence.  He was furnished with the French word 'est', and was told\r\nit was second in a sentence of three words.  The next gentleman gave him\r\nthe German word 'verloren' and said it was the third in a sentence of\r\nfour words.  He asked the next gentleman for one detail in a sum in\r\naddition; another for one detail in a sum of subtraction; others for\r\nsingle details in mathematical problems of various kinds; he got them.\r\nIntermediates gave him single words from sentences in Greek, Latin,\r\nSpanish, Portuguese, Italian, and other languages, and told him their\r\nplaces in the sentences.  When at last everybody had furnished him a\r\nsingle rag from a foreign sentence or a figure from a problem, he went\r\nover the ground again, and got a second word and a second figure and was\r\ntold their places in the sentences and the sums; and so on and so on.  He\r\nwent over the ground again and again until he had collected all the parts\r\nof the sums and all the parts of the sentences--and all in disorder, of\r\ncourse, not in their proper rotation.  This had occupied two hours.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmin now sat silent and thinking, a while, then began and repeated\r\nall the sentences, placing the words in their proper order, and untangled\r\nthe disordered arithmetical problems and gave accurate answers to them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning he had asked the company to throw almonds at him during\r\nthe two hours, he to remember how many each gentleman had thrown; but\r\nnone were thrown, for the Viceroy said that the test would be a\r\nsufficiently severe strain without adding that burden to it.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant had a fine memory for all kinds of things, including even\r\nnames and faces, and I could have furnished an instance of it if I had\r\nthought of it.  The first time I ever saw him was early in his first term\r\nas President.  I had just arrived in Washington from the Pacific coast, a\r\nstranger and wholly unknown to the public, and was passing the White\r\nHouse one morning when I met a friend, a Senator from Nevada.  He asked\r\nme if I would like to see the President.  I said I should be very glad;\r\nso we entered.  I supposed that the President would be in the midst of a\r\ncrowd, and that I could look at him in peace and security from a\r\ndistance, as another stray cat might look at another king.  But it was in\r\nthe morning, and the Senator was using a privilege of his office which I\r\nhad not heard of--the privilege of intruding upon the Chief Magistrate's\r\nworking hours.  Before I knew it, the Senator and I were in the presence,\r\nand there was none there but we three.  General Grant got slowly up from\r\nhis table, put his pen down, and stood before me with the iron expression\r\nof a man who had not smiled for seven years, and was not intending to\r\nsmile for another seven.  He looked me steadily in the eyes--mine lost\r\nconfidence and fell.  I had never confronted a great man before, and was\r\nin a miserable state of funk and inefficiency.  The Senator said:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. President, may I have the privilege of introducing Mr. Clemens?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe President gave my hand an unsympathetic wag and dropped it.  He did\r\nnot say a word but just stood.  In my trouble I could not think of\r\nanything to say, I merely wanted to resign.  There was an awkward pause,\r\na dreary pause, a horrible pause.  Then I thought of something, and\r\nlooked up into that unyielding face, and said timidly:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. President, I--I am embarrassed.  Are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis face broke--just a little--a wee glimmer, the momentary flicker of a\r\nsummer-lightning smile, seven years ahead of time--and I was out and gone\r\nas soon as it was.\r\n\r\nTen years passed away before I saw him the second time.  Meantime I was\r\nbecome better known; and was one of the people appointed to respond to\r\ntoasts at the banquet given to General Grant in Chicago--by the Army of\r\nthe Tennessee when he came back from his tour around the world.  I\r\narrived late at night and got up late in the morning.  All the corridors\r\nof the hotel were crowded with people waiting to get a glimpse of General\r\nGrant when he should pass to the place whence he was to review the great\r\nprocession.  I worked my way by the suite of packed drawing-rooms, and at\r\nthe corner of the house I found a window open where there was a roomy\r\nplatform decorated with flags, and carpeted.  I stepped out on it, and\r\nsaw below me millions of people blocking all the streets, and other\r\nmillions caked together in all the windows and on all the house-tops\r\naround.  These masses took me for General Grant, and broke into volcanic\r\nexplosions and cheers; but it was a good place to see the procession, and\r\nI stayed.  Presently I heard the distant blare of military music, and far\r\nup the street I saw the procession come in sight, cleaving its way\r\nthrough the huzzaing multitudes, with Sheridan, the most martial\r\nfigure of the War, riding at its head in the dress uniform of a\r\nLieutenant-General.\r\n\r\nAnd now General Grant, arm-in-arm with Major Carter Harrison, stepped out\r\non the platform, followed two and two by the badged and uniformed\r\nreception committee.  General Grant was looking exactly as he had looked\r\nupon that trying occasion of ten years before--all iron and bronze\r\nself-possession.  Mr. Harrison came over and led me to the General and\r\nformally introduced me.  Before I could put together the proper remark,\r\nGeneral Grant said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Clemens, I am not embarrassed.  Are you?\xe2\x80\x9d--and that little\r\nseven-year smile twinkled across his face again.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years have gone by since then, and to-day, in New York, the\r\nstreets are a crush of people who are there to honor the remains of the\r\ngreat soldier as they pass to their final resting-place under the\r\nmonument; and the air is heavy with dirges and the boom of artillery, and\r\nall the millions of America are thinking of the man who restored the\r\nUnion and the flag, and gave to democratic government a new lease of\r\nlife, and, as we may hope and do believe, a permanent place among the\r\nbeneficent institutions of men.\r\n\r\nWe had one game in the ship which was a good time-passer--at least it was\r\nat night in the smoking-room when the men were getting freshened up from\r\nthe day's monotonies and dullnesses.  It was the completing of\r\nnon-complete stories.  That is to say, a man would tell all of a story\r\nexcept the finish, then the others would try to supply the ending out of\r\ntheir own invention.  When every one who wanted a chance had had it, the\r\nman who had introduced the story would give it its original ending--then\r\nyou could take your choice.  Sometimes the new endings turned out to be\r\nbetter than the old one.  But the story which called out the most\r\npersistent and determined and ambitious effort was one which had no\r\nending, and so there was nothing to compare the new-made endings with.\r\nThe man who told it said he could furnish the particulars up to a certain\r\npoint only, because that was as much of the tale as he knew.  He had read\r\nit in a volume of sketches twenty-five years ago, and was interrupted\r\nbefore the end was reached.  He would give any one fifty dollars who\r\nwould finish the story to the satisfaction of a jury to be appointed by\r\nourselves.  We appointed a jury and wrestled with the tale.  We invented\r\nplenty of endings, but the jury voted them all down.  The jury was right.\r\nIt was a tale which the author of it may possibly have completed\r\nsatisfactorily, and if he really had that good fortune I would like to\r\nknow what the ending was.  Any ordinary man will find that the story's\r\nstrength is in its middle, and that there is apparently no way to\r\ntransfer it to the close, where of course it ought to be.  In substance\r\nthe storiette was as follows:\r\n\r\nJohn Brown, aged thirty-one, good, gentle, bashful, timid, lived in a\r\nquiet village in Missouri.  He was superintendent of the Presbyterian\r\nSunday-school.  It was but a humble distinction; still, it was his only\r\nofficial one, and he was modestly proud of it and was devoted to its work\r\nand its interests.  The extreme kindliness of his nature was recognized\r\nby all; in fact, people said that he was made entirely out of good\r\nimpulses and bashfulness; that he could always be counted upon for help\r\nwhen it was needed, and for bashfulness both when it was needed and when\r\nit wasn't.\r\n\r\nMary Taylor, twenty-three, modest, sweet, winning, and in character and\r\nperson beautiful, was all in all to him.  And he was very nearly all in\r\nall to her.  She was wavering, his hopes were high.  Her mother had been\r\nin opposition from the first.  But she was wavering, too; he could\r\nsee it.  She was being touched by his warm interest in her two\r\ncharity-proteges and by his contributions toward their support.  These\r\nwere two forlorn and aged sisters who lived in a log hut in a lonely\r\nplace up a cross road four miles from Mrs. Taylor's farm.  One of the\r\nsisters was crazy, and sometimes a little violent, but not often.\r\n\r\nAt last the time seemed ripe for a final advance, and Brown gathered his\r\ncourage together and resolved to make it.  He would take along a\r\ncontribution of double the usual size, and win the mother over; with her\r\nopposition annulled, the rest of the conquest would be sure and prompt.\r\n\r\nHe took to the road in the middle of a placid Sunday afternoon in the\r\nsoft Missourian summer, and he was equipped properly for his mission.  He\r\nwas clothed all in white linen, with a blue ribbon for a necktie, and he\r\nhad on dressy tight boots.  His horse and buggy were the finest that the\r\nlivery stable could furnish.  The lap robe was of white linen, it was\r\nnew, and it had a hand-worked border that could not be rivaled in that\r\nregion for beauty and elaboration.\r\n\r\nWhen he was four miles out on the lonely road and was walking his horse\r\nover a wooden bridge, his straw hat blew off and fell in the creek, and\r\nfloated down and lodged against a bar.  He did not quite know what to do.\r\nHe must have the hat, that was manifest; but how was he to get it?\r\n\r\nThen he had an idea.  The roads were empty, nobody was stirring.  Yes, he\r\nwould risk it.  He led the horse to the roadside and set it to cropping\r\nthe grass; then he undressed and put his clothes in the buggy, petted the\r\nhorse a moment to secure its compassion and its loyalty, then hurried to\r\nthe stream.  He swam out and soon had the hat.  When he got to the top of\r\nthe bank the horse was gone!\r\n\r\nHis legs almost gave way under him.  The horse was walking leisurely\r\nalong the road.  Brown trotted after it, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhoa, whoa, there's a\r\ngood fellow;\xe2\x80\x9d but whenever he got near enough to chance a jump for the\r\nbuggy, the horse quickened its pace a little and defeated him.  And so\r\nthis went on, the naked man perishing with anxiety, and expecting every\r\nmoment to see people come in sight.  He tagged on and on, imploring the\r\nhorse, beseeching the horse, till he had left a mile behind him, and was\r\nclosing up on the Taylor premises; then at last he was successful, and\r\ngot into the buggy.  He flung on his shirt, his necktie, and his coat;\r\nthen reached for--but he was too late; he sat suddenly down and pulled up\r\nthe lap-robe, for he saw some one coming out of the gate--a woman; he\r\nthought.  He wheeled the horse to the left, and struck briskly up the\r\ncross-road.  It was perfectly straight, and exposed on both sides; but\r\nthere were woods and a sharp turn three miles ahead, and he was very\r\ngrateful when he got there.  As he passed around the turn he slowed down\r\nto a walk, and reached for his tr---- too late again.\r\n\r\nHe had come upon Mrs. Enderby, Mrs.  Glossop, Mrs. Taylor, and Mary.\r\nThey were on foot, and seemed tired and excited.  They came at once to\r\nthe buggy and shook hands, and all spoke at once, and said eagerly and\r\nearnestly, how glad they were that he was come, and how fortunate it was.\r\nAnd Mrs. Enderby said, impressively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like an accident, his coming at such a time; but let no one\r\nprofane it with such a name; he was sent--sent from on high.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were all moved, and Mrs. Glossop said in an awed voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSarah Enderby, you never said a truer word in your life.  This is no\r\naccident, it is a special Providence.  He was sent.  He is an angel--an\r\nangel as truly as ever angel was--an angel of deliverance.  I say angel,\r\nSarah Enderby, and will have no other word.  Don't let any one ever say\r\nto me again, that there's no such thing as special Providences; for if\r\nthis isn't one, let them account for it that can.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it's so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Taylor, fervently.  \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Brown, I could\r\nworship you; I could go down on my knees to you.  Didn't something tell\r\nyou?--didn't you feel that you were sent?  I could kiss the hem of your\r\nlaprobe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not able to speak; he was helpless with shame and fright.  Mrs.\r\nTaylor went on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, just look at it all around, Julia Glossop.  Any person can see the\r\nhand of Providence in it.  Here at noon what do we see?  We see the smoke\r\nrising.  I speak up and say, 'That's the Old People's cabin afire.'\r\nDidn't I, Julia Glossop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe very words you said, Nancy Taylor.  I was as close to you as I am\r\nnow, and I heard them.  You may have said hut instead of cabin, but in\r\nsubstance it's the same.  And you were looking pale, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPale?  I was that pale that if--why, you just compare it with this\r\nlaprobe.  Then the next thing I said was, 'Mary Taylor, tell the hired\r\nman to rig up the team-we'll go to the rescue.'  And she said, 'Mother,\r\ndon't you know you told him he could drive to see his people, and stay\r\nover Sunday?'  And it was just so.  I declare for it, I had forgotten it.\r\n'Then,' said I, 'we'll go afoot.'  And go we did.  And found Sarah\r\nEnderby on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we all went together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.  Enderby.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd found the cabin set\r\nfire to and burnt down by the crazy one, and the poor old things so old\r\nand feeble that they couldn't go afoot.  And we got them to a shady place\r\nand made them as comfortable as we could, and began to wonder which way\r\nto turn to find some way to get them conveyed to Nancy Taylor's house.\r\nAnd I spoke up and said--now what did I say?  Didn't I say, 'Providence\r\nwill provide'?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy sure as you live, so you did!  I had forgotten it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo had I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Glossop and Mrs. Taylor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you certainly said\r\nit.  Now wasn't that remarkable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I said it.  And then we went to Mr. Moseley's, two miles, and all\r\nof them were gone to the camp meeting over on Stony Fork; and then we\r\ncame all the way back, two miles, and then here, another mile--and\r\nProvidence has provided.  You see it yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey gazed at each other awe-struck, and lifted their hands and said in\r\nunison:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's per-fectly wonderful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.  Glossop, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think we had better do---let\r\nMr. Brown drive the Old People to Nancy Taylor's one at a time, or put\r\nboth of them in the buggy, and him lead the horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBrown gasped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, then, that's a question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.  Enderby.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, we are all\r\ntired out, and any way we fix it it's going to be difficult.  For if Mr.\r\nBrown takes both of them, at least one of us must, go back to help him,\r\nfor he can't load them into the buggy by himself, and they so helpless.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Taylor.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn't look-oh, how would this do?\r\n--one of us drive there with Mr. Brown, and the rest of you go along to\r\nmy house and get things ready.  I'll go with him.  He and I together can\r\nlift one of the Old People into the buggy; then drive her to my house\r\nand----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who will take care of the other one?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.  Enderby.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nmusn't leave her there in the woods alone, you know--especially the crazy\r\none.  There and back is eight miles, you see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had all been sitting on the grass beside the buggy for a while, now,\r\ntrying to rest their weary bodies.  They fell silent a moment or two, and\r\nstruggled in thought over the baffling situation; then Mrs. Enderby\r\nbrightened and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I've got the idea, now.  You see, we can't walk any more.  Think\r\nwhat we've done: four miles there, two to Moseley's, is six, then back to\r\nhere--nine miles since noon, and not a bite to eat; I declare I don't see\r\nhow we've done it; and as for me, I am just famishing.  Now, somebody's\r\ngot to go back, to help Mr. Brown--there's no getting around that; but\r\nwhoever goes has got to ride, not walk.  So my idea is this: one of us to\r\nride back with Mr. Brown, then ride to Nancy Taylor's house with one of\r\nthe Old People, leaving Mr. Brown to keep the other old one company, you\r\nall to go now to Nancy's and rest and wait; then one of you drive back\r\nand get the other one and drive her to Nancy's, and Mr. Brown walk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSplendid!\xe2\x80\x9d they all cried.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh, that will do--that will answer\r\nperfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d  And they all said that Mrs.  Enderby had the best head for\r\nplanning, in the company; and they said that they wondered that they\r\nhadn't thought of this simple plan themselves.  They hadn't meant to take\r\nback the compliment, good simple souls, and didn't know they had done it.\r\nAfter a consultation it was decided that Mrs. Enderby should drive back\r\nwith Brown, she being entitled to the distinction because she had\r\ninvented the plan.  Everything now being satisfactorily arranged and\r\nsettled, the ladies rose, relieved and happy, and brushed down their\r\ngowns, and three of them started homeward; Mrs. Enderby set her foot on\r\nthe buggy-step and was about to climb in, when Brown found a remnant of\r\nhis voice and gasped out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease Mrs. Enderby, call them back--I am very weak; I can't walk, I\r\ncan't, indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, dear Mr. Brown!  You do look pale; I am ashamed of myself that I\r\ndidn't notice it sooner.  Come back-all of you!  Mr. Brown is not well.\r\nIs there anything I can do for you, Mr. Brown?--I'm real sorry.  Are you\r\nin pain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, madam, only weak; I am not sick, but only just weak--lately; not\r\nlong, but just lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe others came back, and poured out their sympathies and commiserations,\r\nand were full of self-reproaches for not having noticed how pale he was.\r\n\r\nAnd they at once struck out a new plan, and soon agreed that it was by\r\nfar the best of all.  They would all go to Nancy Taylor's house and see\r\nto Brown's needs first.  He could lie on the sofa in the parlor, and\r\nwhile Mrs. Taylor and Mary took care of him the other two ladies would\r\ntake the buggy and go and get one of the Old People, and leave one of\r\nthemselves with the other one, and----\r\n\r\nBy this time, without any solicitation, they were at the horse's head and\r\nwere beginning to turn him around.  The danger was imminent, but Brown\r\nfound his voice again and saved himself.  He said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut ladies, you are overlooking something which makes the plan\r\nimpracticable.  You see, if you bring one of them home, and one remains\r\nbehind with the other, there will be three persons there when one of you\r\ncomes back for that other, for some one must drive the buggy back, and\r\nthree can't come home in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey all exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, sure-ly, that is so!\xe2\x80\x9d and they were, all\r\nperplexed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear, what can we do?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.  Glossop; \xe2\x80\x9cit is the most\r\nmixed-up thing that ever was.  The fox and the goose and the corn and\r\nthings--Oh, dear, they are nothing to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey sat wearily down once more, to further torture their tormented heads\r\nfor a plan that would work.  Presently Mary offered a plan; it was her\r\nfirst effort.  She said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am young and strong, and am refreshed, now.  Take Mr. Brown to our\r\nhouse, and give him help--you see how plainly he needs it.  I will go\r\nback and take care of the Old People; I can be there in twenty minutes.\r\nYou can go on and do what you first started to do--wait on the main road\r\nat our house until somebody comes along with a wagon; then send and bring\r\naway the three of us.  You won't have to wait long; the farmers will soon\r\nbe coming back from town, now.  I will keep old Polly patient and cheered\r\nup--the crazy one doesn't need it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis plan was discussed and accepted; it seemed the best that could be\r\ndone, in the circumstances, and the Old People must be getting\r\ndiscouraged by this time.\r\n\r\nBrown felt relieved, and was deeply thankful.  Let him once get to the\r\nmain road and he would find a way to escape.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Taylor said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe evening chill will be coming on, pretty soon, and those poor old\r\nburnt-out things will need some kind of covering.  Take the lap-robe with\r\nyou, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, Mother, I will.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stepped to the buggy and put out her hand to take it----\r\n\r\nThat was the end of the tale.  The passenger who told it said that when\r\nhe read the story twenty-five years ago in a train he was interrupted at\r\nthat point--the train jumped off a bridge.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought we could finish the story quite easily, and we set to\r\nwork with confidence; but it soon began to appear that it was not a\r\nsimple thing, but difficult and baffling.  This was on account of Brown's\r\ncharacter--great generosity and kindliness, but complicated with unusual\r\nshyness and diffidence, particularly in the presence of ladies.  There\r\nwas his love for Mary, in a hopeful state but not yet secure--just in a\r\ncondition, indeed, where its affair must be handled with great tact, and\r\nno mistakes made, no offense given.  And there was the mother wavering,\r\nhalf willing-by adroit and flawless diplomacy to be won over, now, or\r\nperhaps never at all.  Also, there were the helpless Old People yonder in\r\nthe woods waiting-their fate and Brown's happiness to be determined by\r\nwhat Brown should do within the next two seconds.  Mary was reaching for\r\nthe lap-robe; Brown must decide-there was no time to be lost.\r\n\r\nOf course none but a happy ending of the story would be accepted by the\r\njury; the finish must find Brown in high credit with the ladies, his\r\nbehavior without blemish, his modesty unwounded, his character for self\r\nsacrifice maintained, the Old People rescued through him, their\r\nbenefactor, all the party proud of him, happy in him, his praises on all\r\ntheir tongues.\r\n\r\nWe tried to arrange this, but it was beset with persistent and\r\nirreconcilable difficulties.  We saw that Brown's shyness would not allow\r\nhim to give up the lap-robe.  This would offend Mary and her mother; and\r\nit would surprise the other ladies, partly because this stinginess toward\r\nthe suffering Old People would be out of character with Brown, and partly\r\nbecause he was a special Providence and could not properly act so.  If\r\nasked to explain his conduct, his shyness would not allow him to tell the\r\ntruth, and lack of invention and practice would find him incapable of\r\ncontriving a lie that would wash.  We worked at the troublesome problem\r\nuntil three in the morning.\r\n\r\nMeantime Mary was still reaching for the lap-robe.  We gave it up, and\r\ndecided to let her continue to reach.  It is the reader's privilege to\r\ndetermine for himself how the thing came out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nIt is more trouble to make a maxim than it is to do right.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day out we saw a dim vast bulk standing up out of the\r\nwastes of the Pacific and knew that that spectral promontory was Diamond\r\nHead, a piece of this world which I had not seen before for twenty-nine\r\nyears.  So we were nearing Honolulu, the capital city of the Sandwich\r\nIslands--those islands which to me were Paradise; a Paradise which I had\r\nbeen longing all those years to see again.  Not any other thing in the\r\nworld could have stirred me as the sight of that great rock did.\r\n\r\nIn the night we anchored a mile from shore.  Through my port I could see\r\nthe twinkling lights of Honolulu and the dark bulk of the mountain-range\r\nthat stretched away right and left.  I could not make out the beautiful\r\nNuuana valley, but I knew where it lay, and remembered how it used to\r\nlook in the old times.  We used to ride up it on horseback in those days\r\n--we young people--and branch off and gather bones in a sandy region\r\nwhere one of the first Kamehameha's battles was fought.  He was a\r\nremarkable man, for a king; and he was also a remarkable man for a\r\nsavage.  He was a mere kinglet and of little or no consequence at the\r\ntime of Captain Cook's arrival in 1788; but about four years afterward he\r\nconceived the idea of enlarging his sphere of influence.  That is a\r\ncourteous modern phrase which means robbing your neighbor--for your\r\nneighbor's benefit; and the great theater of its benevolences is Africa.\r\nKamehameha went to war, and in the course of ten years he whipped out all\r\nthe other kings and made himself master of every one of the nine or ten\r\nislands that form the group.  But he did more than that.  He bought\r\nships, freighted them with sandal wood and other native products, and\r\nsent them as far as South America and China; he sold to his savages the\r\nforeign stuffs and tools and utensils which came back in these ships, and\r\nstarted the march of civilization.  It is doubtful if the match to this\r\nextraordinary thing is to be found in the history of any other savage.\r\nSavages are eager to learn from the white man any new way to kill each\r\nother, but it is not their habit to seize with avidity and apply with\r\nenergy the larger and nobler ideas which he offers them.  The details of\r\nKamehameha's history show that he was always hospitably ready to examine\r\nthe white man's ideas, and that he exercised a tidy discrimination in\r\nmaking his selections from the samples placed on view.\r\n\r\nA shrewder discrimination than was exhibited by his son and successor,\r\nLiholiho, I think.  Liholiho could have qualified as a reformer, perhaps,\r\nbut as a king he was a mistake.  A mistake because he tried to be both\r\nking and reformer.  This is mixing fire and gunpowder together.  A king\r\nhas no proper business with reforming.  His best policy is to keep things\r\nas they are; and if he can't do that, he ought to try to make them worse\r\nthan they are.  This is not guesswork; I have thought over this matter a\r\ngood deal, so that if I should ever have a chance to become a king I\r\nwould know how to conduct the business in the best way.\r\n\r\nWhen Liholiho succeeded his father he found himself possessed of an\r\nequipment of royal tools and safeguards which a wiser king would have\r\nknown how to husband, and judiciously employ, and make profitable.  The\r\nentire country was under the one scepter, and his was that scepter.\r\nThere was an Established Church, and he was the head of it.  There was a\r\nStanding Army, and he was the head of that; an Army of 114 privates under\r\ncommand of 27 Generals and a Field Marshal.  There was a proud and\r\nancient Hereditary Nobility.  There was still one other asset.  This was\r\nthe tabu--an agent endowed with a mysterious and stupendous power, an\r\nagent not found among the properties of any European monarch, a tool of\r\ninestimable value in the business.  Liholiho was headmaster of the tabu.\r\nThe tabu was the most ingenious and effective of all the inventions that\r\nhas ever been devised for keeping a people's privileges satisfactorily\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nIt required the sexes to live in separate houses.  It did not allow\r\npeople to eat in either house; they must eat in another place.  It did\r\nnot allow a man's woman-folk to enter his house.  It did not allow the\r\nsexes to eat together; the men must eat first, and the women must wait on\r\nthem.  Then the women could eat what was left--if anything was left--and\r\nwait on themselves.  I mean, if anything of a coarse or unpalatable sort\r\nwas left, the women could have it.  But not the good things, the fine\r\nthings, the choice things, such as pork, poultry, bananas, cocoanuts, the\r\nchoicer varieties of fish, and so on.  By the tabu, all these were sacred\r\nto the men; the women spent their lives longing for them and wondering\r\nwhat they might taste like; and they died without finding out.\r\n\r\nThese rules, as you see, were quite simple and clear.  It was easy to\r\nremember them; and useful.  For the penalty for infringing any rule in\r\nthe whole list was death.  Those women easily learned to put up with\r\nshark and taro and dog for a diet when the other things were so\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nIt was death for any one to walk upon tabu'd ground; or defile a tabu'd\r\nthing with his touch; or fail in due servility to a chief; or step upon\r\nthe king's shadow.  The nobles and the King and the priests were always\r\nsuspending little rags here and there and yonder, to give notice to the\r\npeople that the decorated spot or thing was tabu, and death lurking near.\r\nThe struggle for life was difficult and chancy in the islands in those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThus advantageously was the new king situated.  Will it be believed that\r\nthe first thing he did was to destroy his Established Church, root and\r\nbranch?  He did indeed do that.  To state the case figuratively, he was a\r\nprosperous sailor who burnt his ship and took to a raft.  This Church was\r\na horrid thing.  It heavily oppressed the people; it kept them always\r\ntrembling in the gloom of mysterious threatenings; it slaughtered them in\r\nsacrifice before its grotesque idols of wood and stone; it cowed them, it\r\nterrorized them, it made them slaves to its priests, and through the\r\npriests to the king.  It was the best friend a king could have, and the\r\nmost dependable.  To a professional reformer who should annihilate so\r\nfrightful and so devastating a power as this Church, reverence and praise\r\nwould be due; but to a king who should do it, could properly be due\r\nnothing but reproach; reproach softened by sorrow; sorrow for his\r\nunfitness for his position.\r\n\r\nHe destroyed his Established Church, and his kingdom is a republic today,\r\nin consequence of that act.\r\n\r\nWhen he destroyed the Church and burned the idols he did a mighty thing\r\nfor civilization and for his people's weal--but it was not \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It was unkingly, it was inartistic.  It made trouble for his line.  The\r\nAmerican missionaries arrived while the burned idols were still smoking.\r\nThey found the nation without a religion, and they repaired the defect.\r\nThey offered their own religion and it was gladly received.  But it was\r\nno support to arbitrary kingship, and so the kingly power began to weaken\r\nfrom that day.  Forty-seven years later, when I was in the islands,\r\nKamehameha V.  was trying to repair Liholiho's blunder, and not\r\nsucceeding.  He had set up an Established Church and made himself the\r\nhead of it.  But it was only a pinchbeck thing, an imitation, a bauble,\r\nan empty show.  It had no power, no value for a king.  It could not harry\r\nor burn or slay, it in no way resembled the admirable machine which\r\nLiholiho destroyed.  It was an Established Church without an\r\nEstablishment; all the people were Dissenters.\r\n\r\nLong before that, the kingship had itself become but a name, a show.  At\r\nan early day the missionaries had turned it into something very much like\r\na republic; and here lately the business whites have turned it into\r\nsomething exactly like it.\r\n\r\nIn Captain Cook's time (1778), the native population of the islands was\r\nestimated at 400,000; in 1836 at something short of 200,000, in 1866 at\r\n50,000; it is to-day, per census, 25,000.  All intelligent people praise\r\nKamehameha I. and Liholiho for conferring upon their people the great\r\nboon of civilization.  I would do it myself, but my intelligence is out\r\nof repair, now, from over-work.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted with\r\na young American couple who had among their belongings an attractive\r\nlittle son of the age of seven--attractive but not practicably\r\ncompanionable with me, because he knew no English.  He had played from\r\nhis birth with the little Kanakas on his father's plantation, and had\r\npreferred their language and would learn no other.  The family removed to\r\nAmerica a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boy\r\nbegan to lose his Kanaka and pick up English.  By the time he was twelve\r\nhe hadn't a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed from\r\nhis tongue and from his comprehension.  Nine years later, when he was\r\ntwenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York,\r\nand the mother told me about an adventure which her son had been having.\r\nBy trade he was now a professional diver.  A passenger boat had been\r\ncaught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her people\r\nwith her.  A few days later the young diver descended, with his armor on,\r\nand entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of the\r\ncompanionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water.\r\nPresently something touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and found\r\na dead man swaying and bobbing about him and seemingly inspecting him\r\ninquiringly.  He was paralyzed with fright.  His entry had disturbed the\r\nwater, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him and\r\nwagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying to\r\ndance.  His senses forsook him, and in that condition he was drawn to the\r\nsurface.  He was put to bed at home, and was soon very ill.  During some\r\ndays he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; and\r\nwhile they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and Kanaka\r\nonly.  He was still very ill, and he talked to me in that tongue; but I\r\ndid not understand it, of course.  The doctor-books tell us that cases\r\nlike this are not uncommon.  Then the doctors ought to study the cases\r\nand find out how to multiply them.  Many languages and things get mislaid\r\nin a person's head, and stay mislaid for lack of this remedy.\r\n\r\nMany memories of my former visit to the islands came up in my mind while\r\nwe lay at anchor in front of Honolulu that night.  And pictures--pictures\r\npictures--an enchanting procession of them!  I was impatient for the\r\nmorning to come.\r\n\r\nWhen it came it brought disappointment, of course.  Cholera had broken\r\nout in the town, and we were not allowed to have any communication with\r\nthe shore.  Thus suddenly did my dream of twenty-nine years go to ruin.\r\nMessages came from friends, but the friends themselves I was not to have\r\nany sight of.  My lecture-hall was ready, but I was not to see that,\r\neither.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were sent\r\nashore; but nobody could go ashore and return.  There were people on\r\nshore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we could not\r\nreceive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term in Sydney.  They\r\ncould have escaped the day before, by ship to San Francisco; but the bars\r\nhad been put up, now, and they might have to wait weeks before any ship\r\ncould venture to give them a passage any whither.  And there were\r\nhardships for others.  An elderly lady and her son, recreation-seekers\r\nfrom Massachusetts, had wandered westward, further and further from home,\r\nalways intending to take the return track, but always concluding to go\r\nstill a little further; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulu\r\npositively their last westward-bound indulgence--they had made up their\r\nminds to that--but where is the use in making up your mind in this world?\r\nIt is usually a waste of time to do it.  These two would have to stay\r\nwith us as far as Australia.  Then they could go on around the world, or\r\ngo back the way they had come; the distance and the accommodations and\r\noutlay of time would be just the same, whichever of the two routes they\r\nmight elect to take.  Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundred\r\nmiles gradually enlarged, without any elaborate degree of intention, to a\r\npossible twenty-four thousand.  However, they were used to extensions by\r\nthis time, and did not mind this new one much.\r\n\r\nAnd we had with us a lawyer from Victoria, who had been sent out by the\r\nGovernment on an international matter, and he had brought his wife with\r\nhim and left the children at home with the servants and now what was to\r\nbe done?  Go ashore amongst the cholera and take the risks?  Most\r\ncertainly not.  They decided to go on, to the Fiji islands, wait there a\r\nfortnight for the next ship, and then sail for home.  They couldn't\r\nforesee that they wouldn't see a homeward-bound ship again for six weeks,\r\nand that no word could come to them from the children, and no word go\r\nfrom them to the children in all that time.  It is easy to make plans in\r\nthis world; even a cat can do it; and when one is out in those remote\r\noceans it is noticeable that a cat's plans and a man's are worth about\r\nthe same.  There is much the same shrinkage in both, in the matter of\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for us to do but sit about the decks in the shade of\r\nthe awnings and look at the distant shore.  We lay in luminous blue\r\nwater; shoreward the water was green-green and brilliant; at the shore\r\nitself it broke in a long white ruffle, and with no crash, no sound that\r\nwe could hear.  The town was buried under a mat of foliage that looked\r\nlike a cushion of moss.  The silky mountains were clothed in soft, rich\r\nsplendors of melting color, and some of the cliffs were veiled in\r\nslanting mists.  I recognized it all.  It was just as I had seen it long\r\nbefore, with nothing of its beauty lost, nothing of its charm wanting.\r\n\r\nA change had come, but that was political, and not visible from the ship.\r\nThe monarchy of my day was gone, and a republic was sitting in its seat.\r\nIt was not a material change.  The old imitation pomps, the fuss and\r\nfeathers, have departed, and the royal trademark--that is about all that\r\none could miss, I suppose.  That imitation monarchy, was grotesque\r\nenough, in my time; if it had held on another thirty years it would have\r\nbeen a monarchy without subjects of the king's race.\r\n\r\nWe had a sunset of a very fine sort.  The vast plain of the sea was\r\nmarked off in bands of sharply-contrasted colors: great stretches of dark\r\nblue, others of purple, others of polished bronze; the billowy mountains\r\nshowed all sorts of dainty browns and greens, blues and purples and\r\nblacks, and the rounded velvety backs of certain of them made one want to\r\nstroke them, as one would the sleek back of a cat.  The long, sloping\r\npromontory projecting into the sea at the west turned dim and leaden and\r\nspectral, then became suffused with pink--dissolved itself in a pink\r\ndream, so to speak, it seemed so airy and unreal.  Presently the\r\ncloud-rack was flooded with fiery splendors, and these were copied on the\r\nsurface of the sea, and it made one drunk with delight to look upon it.\r\n\r\nFrom talks with certain of our passengers whose home was Honolulu, and\r\nfrom a sketch by Mrs. Mary H. Krout, I was able to perceive what the\r\nHonolulu of to-day is, as compared with the Honolulu of my time.  In my\r\ntime it was a beautiful little town, made up of snow-white wooden\r\ncottages deliciously smothered in tropical vines and flowers and trees\r\nand shrubs; and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth, and as\r\nwhite as the houses.  The outside aspects of the place suggested the\r\npresence of a modest and comfortable prosperity--a general prosperity\r\n--perhaps one might strengthen the term and say universal.  There were no\r\nfine houses, no fine furniture.  There were no decorations.  Tallow\r\ncandles furnished the light for the bedrooms, a whale-oil lamp furnished\r\nit for the parlor.  Native matting served as carpeting.  In the parlor\r\none would find two or three lithographs on the walls--portraits as a\r\nrule: Kamehameha IV., Louis Kossuth, Jenny Lind; and may be an engraving\r\nor two: Rebecca at the Well, Moses smiting the rock, Joseph's servants\r\nfinding the cup in Benjamin's sack.  There would be a center table, with\r\nbooks of a tranquil sort on it: The Whole Duty of Man, Baxter's Saints'\r\nRest, Fox's Martyrs, Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, bound copies of The\r\nMissionary Herald and of Father Damon's Seaman's Friend.  A melodeon; a\r\nmusic stand, with 'Willie, We have Missed You', 'Star of the Evening',\r\n'Roll on Silver Moon', 'Are We Most There', 'I Would not Live Alway', and\r\nother songs of love and sentiment, together with an assortment of hymns.\r\nA what-not with semi-globular glass paperweights, enclosing miniature\r\npictures of ships, New England rural snowstorms, and the like; sea-shells\r\nwith Bible texts carved on them in cameo style; native curios; whale's\r\ntooth with full-rigged ship carved on it.  There was nothing reminiscent\r\nof foreign parts, for nobody had been abroad.  Trips were made to San\r\nFrancisco, but that could not be called going abroad.  Comprehensively\r\nspeaking, nobody traveled.\r\n\r\nBut Honolulu has grown wealthy since then, and of course wealth has\r\nintroduced changes; some of the old simplicities have disappeared.  Here\r\nis a modern house, as pictured by Mrs.  Krout:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAlmost every house is surrounded by extensive lawns and gardens\r\n     enclosed by walls of volcanic stone or by thick hedges of the\r\n     brilliant hibiscus.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe houses are most tastefully and comfortably furnished; the\r\n     floors are either of hard wood covered with rugs or with fine Indian\r\n     matting, while there is a preference, as in most warm countries, for\r\n     rattan or bamboo furniture; there are the usual accessories of\r\n     bric-a-brac, pictures, books, and curios from all parts of the\r\nworld,\r\n     for these island dwellers are indefatigable travelers.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNearly every house has what is called a lanai.  It is a large\r\n     apartment, roofed, floored, open on three sides, with a door or a\r\n     draped archway opening into the drawing-room.  Frequently the roof\r\n     is formed by the thick interlacing boughs of the hou tree,\r\n     impervious to the sun and even to the rain, except in violent\r\n     storms.  Vines are trained about the sides--the stephanotis or some\r\n     one of the countless fragrant and blossoming trailers which abound\r\n     in the islands.  There are also curtains of matting that may be\r\n     drawn to exclude the sun or rain.  The floor is bare for coolness,\r\n     or partially covered with rugs, and the lanai is prettily furnished\r\n     with comfortable chairs, sofas, and tables loaded with flowers, or\r\n     wonderful ferns in pots.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe lanai is the favorite reception room, and here at any social\r\n     function the musical program is given and cakes and ices are served;\r\n     here morning callers are received, or gay riding parties, the ladies\r\n     in pretty divided skirts, worn for convenience in riding astride,\r\n     --the universal mode adopted by Europeans and Americans, as well as\r\n     by the natives.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe comfort and luxury of such an apartment, especially at a\r\n     seashore villa, can hardly be imagined.  The soft breezes sweep\r\n     across it, heavy with the fragrance of jasmine and gardenia, and\r\n     through the swaying boughs of palm and mimosa there are glimpses of\r\n     rugged mountains, their summits veiled in clouds, of purple sea with\r\n     the white surf beating eternally against the reefs, whiter still in\r\n     the yellow sunlight or the magical moonlight of the tropics.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere: rugs, ices, pictures, lanais, worldly books, sinful bric-a-brac\r\nfetched from everywhere.  And the ladies riding astride.  These are\r\nchanges, indeed.  In my time the native women rode astride, but the white\r\nones lacked the courage to adopt their wise custom.  In my time ice was\r\nseldom seen in Honolulu.  It sometimes came in sailing vessels from New\r\nEngland as ballast; and then, if there happened to be a man-of-war in\r\nport and balls and suppers raging by consequence, the ballast was worth\r\nsix hundred dollars a ton, as is evidenced by reputable tradition.  But\r\nthe ice-machine has traveled all over the world, now, and brought ice\r\nwithin everybody's reach.  In Lapland and Spitzbergen no one uses native\r\nice in our day, except the bears and the walruses.\r\n\r\nThe bicycle is not mentioned.  It was not necessary.  We know that it is\r\nthere, without inquiring.  It is everywhere.  But for it, people could\r\nnever have had summer homes on the summit of Mont Blanc; before its day,\r\nproperty up there had but a nominal value.  The ladies of the Hawaiian\r\ncapital learned too late the right way to occupy a horse--too late to get\r\nmuch benefit from it.  The riding-horse is retiring from business\r\neverywhere in the world.  In Honolulu a few years from now he will be\r\nonly a tradition.\r\n\r\nWe all know about Father Damien, the French priest who voluntarily\r\nforsook the world and went to the leper island of Molokai to labor among\r\nits population of sorrowful exiles who wait there, in slow-consuming\r\nmisery, for death to come and release them from their troubles; and we\r\nknow that the thing which he knew beforehand would happen, did happen:\r\nthat he became a leper himself, and died of that horrible disease.  There\r\nwas still another case of self-sacrifice, it appears.  I asked after\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBilly\xe2\x80\x9d Ragsdale, interpreter to the Parliament in my time--a half-white.\r\nHe was a brilliant young fellow, and very popular.  As an interpreter he\r\nwould have been hard to match anywhere.  He used to stand up in the\r\nParliament and turn the English speeches into Hawaiian and the Hawaiian\r\nspeeches into English with a readiness and a volubility that were\r\nastonishing.  I asked after him, and was told that his prosperous career\r\nwas cut short in a sudden and unexpected way, just as he was about to\r\nmarry a beautiful half-caste girl.  He discovered, by some nearly\r\ninvisible sign about his skin, that the poison of leprosy was in him.\r\nThe secret was his own, and might be kept concealed for years; but he\r\nwould not be treacherous to the girl that loved him; he would not marry\r\nher to a doom like his.  And so he put his affairs in order, and went\r\naround to all his friends and bade them good-bye, and sailed in the leper\r\nship to Molokai.  There he died the loathsome and lingering death that\r\nall lepers die.\r\n\r\nIn this place let me insert a paragraph or two from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Paradise of\r\nthe Pacific\xe2\x80\x9d (Rev. H. H. Gowen)--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cPoor lepers!  It is easy for those who have no relatives or friends\r\n     among them to enforce the decree of segregation to the letter, but\r\n     who can write of the terrible, the heart-breaking scenes which that\r\n     enforcement has brought about?\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA man upon Hawaii was suddenly taken away after a summary arrest,\r\n     leaving behind him a helpless wife about to give birth to a babe.\r\n     The devoted wife with great pain and risk came the whole journey to\r\n     Honolulu, and pleaded until the authorities were unable to resist\r\n     her entreaty that she might go and live like a leper with her leper\r\n     husband.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA woman in the prime of life and activity is condemned as an\r\n     incipient leper, suddenly removed from her home, and her husband\r\n     returns to find his two helpless babes moaning for their lost\r\n     mother.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cImagine it!  The case of the babies is hard, but its bitterness is\r\n     a trifle--less than a trifle--less than nothing--compared to what\r\n     the mother must suffer; and suffer minute by minute, hour by hour,\r\n     day by day, month by month, year by year, without respite, relief,\r\n     or any abatement of her pain till she dies.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cOne woman, Luka Kaaukau, has been living with her leper husband in\r\n     the settlement for twelve years.  The man has scarcely a joint left,\r\n     his limbs are only distorted ulcerated stumps, for four years his\r\n     wife has put every particle of food into his mouth.  He wanted his\r\n     wife to abandon his wretched carcass long ago, as she herself was\r\n     sound and well, but Luka said that she was content to remain and\r\n     wait on the man she loved till the spirit should be freed from its\r\n     burden.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI myself have known hard cases enough:--of a girl, apparently in\r\n     full health, decorating the church with me at Easter, who before\r\n     Christmas is taken away as a confirmed leper; of a mother hiding her\r\n     child in the mountains for years so that not even her dearest\r\n     friends knew that she had a child alive, that he might not be taken\r\n     away; of a respectable white man taken away from his wife and\r\n     family, and compelled to become a dweller in the Leper Settlement,\r\n     where he is counted dead, even by the insurance companies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd one great pity of it all is, that these poor sufferers are innocent.\r\nThe leprosy does not come of sins which they committed, but of sins\r\ncommitted by their ancestors, who escaped the curse of leprosy!\r\n\r\nMr. Gowan has made record of a certain very striking circumstance.  Would\r\nyou expect to find in that awful Leper Settlement a custom worthy to be\r\ntransplanted to your own country?  They have one such, and it is\r\ninexpressibly touching and beautiful.  When death sets open the\r\nprison-door of life there, the band salutes the freed soul with a burst\r\nof glad music!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA dozen direct censures are easier to bear than one morganatic\r\ncompliment.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nSailed from Honolulu.--From diary:\r\n\r\nSept. 2.  Flocks of flying fish-slim, shapely, graceful, and intensely\r\nwhite.  With the sun on them they look like a flight of silver\r\nfruit-knives.  They are able to fly a hundred yards.\r\n\r\nSept. 3.  In 9 deg. 50' north latitude, at breakfast.  Approaching the\r\nequator on a long slant.  Those of us who have never seen the equator are\r\na good deal excited.  I think I would rather see it than any other thing\r\nin the world.  We entered the \xe2\x80\x9cdoldrums\xe2\x80\x9d last night--variable winds,\r\nbursts of rain, intervals of calm, with chopping seas and a wobbly and\r\ndrunken motion to the ship--a condition of things findable in\r\nother regions sometimes, but present in the doldrums always.  The\r\nglobe-girdling belt called the doldrums is 20 degrees wide, and the\r\nthread called the equator lies along the middle of it.\r\n\r\nSept. 4.  Total eclipse of the moon last night.  At 7.30 it began to go\r\noff.  At total--or about that--it was like a rich rosy cloud with a\r\ntumbled surface framed in the circle and projecting from it--a bulge of\r\nstrawberry-ice, so to speak.  At half-eclipse the moon was like a gilded\r\nacorn in its cup.\r\n\r\nSept. 5.  Closing in on the equator this noon.  A sailor explained to a\r\nyoung girl that the ship's speed is poor because we are climbing up the\r\nbulge toward the center of the globe; but that when we should once get\r\nover, at the equator, and start down-hill, we should fly.  When she asked\r\nhim the other day what the fore-yard was, he said it was the front yard,\r\nthe open area in the front end of the ship.  That man has a good deal of\r\nlearning stored up, and the girl is likely to get it all.\r\n\r\nAfternoon.  Crossed the equator.  In the distance it looked like a blue\r\nribbon stretched across the ocean.  Several passengers kodak'd it.  We\r\nhad no fool ceremonies, no fantastics, no horse play.  All that sort of\r\nthing has gone out.  In old times a sailor, dressed as Neptune, used to\r\ncome in over the bows, with his suite, and lather up and shave everybody\r\nwho was crossing the equator for the first time, and then cleanse these\r\nunfortunates by swinging them from the yard-arm and ducking them three\r\ntimes in the sea. This was considered funny.  Nobody knows why.  No, that\r\nis not true.  We do know why.  Such a thing could never be funny on land;\r\nno part of the old-time grotesque performances gotten up on shipboard to\r\ncelebrate the passage of the line could ever be funny on shore--they\r\nwould seem dreary and witless to shore people.  But the shore people\r\nwould\r\nchange their minds about it at sea, on a long voyage.  On such a voyage,\r\nwith its eternal monotonies, people's intellects deteriorate; the owners\r\nof the intellects soon reach a point where they almost seem to prefer\r\nchildish things to things of a maturer degree.  One is often surprised at\r\nthe juvenilities which grown people indulge in at sea, and the interest\r\nthey take in them, and the consuming enjoyment they get out of them.\r\nThis is on long voyages only.  The mind gradually becomes inert, dull,\r\nblunted; it loses its accustomed interest in intellectual things; nothing\r\nbut horse-play can rouse it, nothing but wild and foolish grotesqueries\r\ncan entertain it.  On short voyages it makes no such exposure of itself;\r\nit hasn't time to slump down to this sorrowful level.\r\n\r\nThe short-voyage passenger gets his chief physical exercise out of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chorse-billiards\xe2\x80\x9d--shovel-board.  It is a good game.  We play it in this\r\nship.  A quartermaster chalks off a diagram like this-on the deck.\r\n\r\nThe player uses a cue that is like a broom-handle with a quarter-moon of\r\nwood fastened to the end of it.  With this he shoves wooden disks the\r\nsize of a saucer--he gives the disk a vigorous shove and sends it fifteen\r\nor twenty feet along the deck and lands it in one of the squares if he\r\ncan.  If it stays there till the inning is played out, it will count as\r\nmany points in the game as the figure in the square it has stopped in\r\nrepresents.  The adversary plays to knock that disk out and leave his own\r\nin its place--particularly if it rests upon the 9 or 10 or some other of\r\nthe high numbers; but if it rests in the \xe2\x80\x9c10off\xe2\x80\x9d he backs it up--lands\r\nhis disk behind it a foot or two, to make it difficult for its owner to\r\nknock it out of that damaging place and improve his record.  When the\r\ninning is played out it may be found that each adversary has placed his\r\nfour disks where they count; it may be found that some of them are\r\ntouching chalk lines and not counting; and very often it will be found\r\nthat there has been a general wreckage, and that not a disk has been left\r\nwithin the diagram.  Anyway, the result is recorded, whatever it is, and\r\nthe game goes on.  The game is 100 points, and it takes from twenty\r\nminutes to forty to play it, according to luck and the condition of the\r\nsea.  It is an exciting game, and the crowd of spectators furnish\r\nabundance of applause for fortunate shots and plenty of laughter for the\r\nother kind.  It is a game of skill, but at the same time the uneasy\r\nmotion of the ship is constantly interfering with skill; this makes it a\r\nchancy game, and the element of luck comes largely in.\r\n\r\nWe had a couple of grand tournaments, to determine who should be\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChampion of the Pacific\xe2\x80\x9d; they included among the participants nearly\r\nall the passengers, of both sexes, and the officers of the ship, and they\r\nafforded many days of stupendous interest and excitement, and murderous\r\nexercise--for horse-billiards is a physically violent game.\r\n\r\nThe figures in the following record of some of the closing games in the\r\nfirst tournament will show, better than any description, how very chancy\r\nthe game is.  The losers here represented had all been winners in the\r\nprevious games of the series, some of them by fine majorities:\r\n\r\nChase,102      Mrs.  D.,57    Mortimer, 105  The Surgeon, 92\r\nMiss C.,105    Mrs.  T.,9     Clemens, 101   Taylor,92\r\nTaylor,109     Davies,95      Miss C., 108   Mortimer,55\r\nThomas,102     Roper,76       Clemens, 111   Miss C.,89\r\nCoomber, 106   Chase,98\r\n\r\nAnd so on; until but three couples of winners were left.  Then I beat my\r\nman, young Smith beat his man, and Thomas beat his.  This reduced the\r\ncombatants to three.  Smith and I took the deck, and I led off.  At the\r\nclose of the first inning I was 10 worse than nothing and Smith had\r\nscored 7.  The luck continued against me.  When I was 57, Smith was 97\r\n--within 3 of out.  The luck changed then.  He picked up a 10-off or so,\r\nand couldn't recover.  I beat him.\r\n\r\nThe next game would end tournament No. 1.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas and I were the contestants.  He won the lead and went to the\r\nbat--so to speak.  And there he stood, with the crotch of his cue resting\r\nagainst his disk while the ship rose slowly up, sank slowly down, rose\r\nagain, sank again.  She never seemed to rise to suit him exactly.  She\r\nstarted up once more; and when she was nearly ready for the turn, he let\r\ndrive and landed his disk just within the left-hand end of the 10.\r\n(Applause).  The umpire proclaimed \xe2\x80\x9ca good 10,\xe2\x80\x9d and the game-keeper set\r\nit down.  I played: my disk grazed the edge of Mr. Thomas's disk, and\r\nwent out of the diagram.  (No applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas played again--and landed his second disk alongside of the\r\nfirst, and almost touching its right-hand side.  \xe2\x80\x9cGood 10.\xe2\x80\x9d (Great\r\napplause.)\r\n\r\nI played, and missed both of them.  (No applause.)\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas delivered his third shot and landed his disk just at the right\r\nof the other two.  \xe2\x80\x9cGood 10.\xe2\x80\x9d (Immense applause.)\r\n\r\nThere they lay, side by side, the three in a row.  It did not seem\r\npossible that anybody could miss them.  Still I did it.  (Immense\r\nsilence.)\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas played his last disk.  It seems incredible, but he actually\r\nlanded that disk alongside of the others, and just to the right of them-a\r\nstraight solid row of 4 disks.  (Tumultuous and long-continued applause.)\r\n\r\nThen I played my last disk.  Again it did not seem possible that anybody\r\ncould miss that row--a row which would have been 14 inches long if the\r\ndisks had been clamped together; whereas, with the spaces separating them\r\nthey made a longer row than that.  But I did it.  It may be that I was\r\ngetting nervous.\r\n\r\nI think it unlikely that that innings has ever had its parallel in the\r\nhistory of horse-billiards.  To place the four disks side by side in the\r\n10 was an extraordinary feat; indeed, it was a kind of miracle.  To miss\r\nthem was another miracle.  It will take a century to produce another man\r\nwho can place the four disks in the 10; and longer than that to find a\r\nman who can't knock them out.  I was ashamed of my performance at the\r\ntime, but now that I reflect upon it I see that it was rather fine and\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas kept his luck, and won the game, and later the championship.\r\n\r\nIn a minor tournament I won the prize, which was a Waterbury watch.  I\r\nput it in my trunk.  In Pretoria, South Africa, nine months afterward, my\r\nproper watch broke down and I took the Waterbury out, wound it, set it by\r\nthe great clock on the Parliament House (8.05), then went back to my room\r\nand went to bed, tired from a long railway journey.  The parliamentary\r\nclock had a peculiarity which I was not aware of at the time\r\n--a peculiarity which exists in no other clock, and would not exist in\r\nthat\r\none if it had been made by a sane person; on the half-hour it strikes the\r\nsucceeding hour, then strikes the hour again, at the proper time.  I lay\r\nreading and smoking awhile; then, when I could hold my eyes open no\r\nlonger and was about to put out the light, the great clock began to boom,\r\nand I counted ten.  I reached for the Waterbury to see how it was getting\r\nalong.  It was marking 9.30.  It seemed rather poor speed for a\r\nthree-dollar watch, but I supposed that the climate was affecting it.  I\r\nshoved it half an hour ahead; and took to my book and waited to see what\r\nwould happen.  At 10 the great clock struck ten again.  I looked--the\r\nWaterbury was marking half-past 10.  This was too much speed for the\r\nmoney, and it troubled me.  I pushed the hands back a half hour, and\r\nwaited once more; I had to, for I was vexed and restless now, and my\r\nsleepiness was gone. By and by the great clock struck 11.  The Waterbury\r\nwas marking 10.30.  I pushed it ahead half an hour, with some show of\r\ntemper.  By and by the great clock struck 11 again.  The Waterbury showed\r\nup 11.30, now, and I beat her brains out against the bedstead.  I was\r\nsorry next day, when I found out.\r\n\r\nTo return to the ship.\r\n\r\nThe average human being is a perverse creature; and when he isn't that,\r\nhe is a practical joker.  The result to the other person concerned is\r\nabout the same: that is, he is made to suffer.  The washing down of the\r\ndecks begins at a very early hour in all ships; in but few ships are any\r\nmeasures taken to protect the passengers, either by waking or warning\r\nthem, or by sending a steward to close their ports.  And so the\r\ndeckwashers have their opportunity, and they use it.  They send a bucket\r\nof water slashing along the side of the ship and into the ports,\r\ndrenching the passenger's clothes, and often the passenger himself.  This\r\ngood old custom prevailed in this ship, and under unusually favorable\r\ncircumstances, for in the blazing tropical regions a removable zinc thing\r\nlike a sugarshovel projects from the port to catch the wind and bring it\r\nin; this thing catches the wash-water and brings it in, too--and in\r\nflooding abundance.  Mrs. I., an invalid, had to sleep on the locker--\r\nsofa\r\nunder her port, and every time she over-slept and thus failed to take\r\ncare of herself, the deck-washers drowned her out.\r\n\r\nAnd the painters, what a good time they had!  This ship would be going\r\ninto dock for a month in Sydney for repairs; but no matter, painting was\r\ngoing on all the time somewhere or other.  The ladies' dresses were\r\nconstantly getting ruined, nevertheless protests and supplications went\r\nfor nothing.  Sometimes a lady, taking an afternoon nap on deck near a\r\nventilator or some other thing that didn't need painting, would wake up\r\nby and by and find that the humorous painter had been noiselessly daubing\r\nthat thing and had splattered her white gown all over with little greasy\r\nyellow spots.\r\n\r\nThe blame for this untimely painting did not lie with the ship's\r\nofficers, but with custom.  As far back as Noah's time it became law that\r\nships must be constantly painted and fussed at when at sea; custom grew\r\nout of the law, and at sea custom knows no death; this custom will\r\ncontinue until the sea goes dry.\r\n\r\nSept. 8.--Sunday.  We are moving so nearly south that we cross only about\r\ntwo meridians of longitude a day.  This morning we were in longitude 178\r\nwest from Greenwich, and 57 degrees west from San Francisco.  To-morrow\r\nwe shall be close to the center of the globe--the 180th degree of west\r\nlongitude and 180th degree of east longitude.\r\n\r\nAnd then we must drop out a day-lose a day out of our lives, a day never\r\nto be found again.  We shall all die one day earlier than from the\r\nbeginning of time we were foreordained to die.  We shall be a day\r\nbehindhand all through eternity.  We shall always be saying to the other\r\nangels, \xe2\x80\x9cFine day today,\xe2\x80\x9d and they will be always retorting, \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\r\nisn't to-day, it's tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d We shall be in a state of confusion all the\r\ntime and shall never know what true happiness is.\r\n\r\nNext Day.  Sure enough, it has happened.  Yesterday it was September 8,\r\nSunday; to-day, per the bulletin-board at the head of the companionway,\r\nit is September 10, Tuesday.  There is something uncanny about it.  And\r\nuncomfortable.  In fact, nearly unthinkable, and wholly unrealizable,\r\nwhen one comes to consider it.  While we were crossing the 180th meridian\r\nit was Sunday in the stern of the ship where my family were, and Tuesday\r\nin the bow where I was.  They were there eating the half of a fresh apple\r\non the 8th, and I was at the same time eating the other half of it on the\r\n10th--and I could notice how stale it was, already.  The family were the\r\nsame age that they were when I had left them five minutes before, but I\r\nwas a day older now than I was then.  The day they were living in\r\nstretched behind them half way round the globe, across the Pacific Ocean\r\nand America and Europe; the day I was living in stretched in front of me\r\naround the other half to meet it.  They were stupendous days for bulk and\r\nstretch; apparently much larger days than we had ever been in before.\r\nAll previous days had been but shrunk-up little things by comparison.\r\nThe difference in temperature between the two days was very marked, their\r\nday being hotter than mine because it was closer to the equator.\r\n\r\nAlong about the moment that we were crossing the Great Meridian a child\r\nwas born in the steerage, and now there is no way to tell which day it\r\nwas born on.  The nurse thinks it was Sunday, the surgeon thinks it was\r\nTuesday.  The child will never know its own birthday.  It will always be\r\nchoosing first one and then the other, and will never be able to make up\r\nits mind permanently.  This will breed vacillation and uncertainty in its\r\nopinions about religion, and politics, and business, and sweethearts, and\r\neverything, and will undermine its principles, and rot them away, and\r\nmake the poor thing characterless, and its success in life impossible.\r\nEvery one in the ship says so.  And this is not all--in fact, not the\r\nworst.  For there is an enormously rich brewer in the ship who said as\r\nmuch as ten days ago, that if the child was born on his birthday he would\r\ngive it ten thousand dollars to start its little life with.  His birthday\r\nwas Monday, the 9th of September.\r\n\r\nIf the ships all moved in the one direction--westward, I mean--the world\r\nwould suffer a prodigious loss--in the matter of valuable time, through\r\nthe dumping overboard on the Great Meridian of such multitudes of days by\r\nships crews and passengers.  But fortunately the ships do not all sail\r\nwest, half of them sail east.  So there is no real loss.  These latter\r\npick up all the discarded days and add them to the world's stock again;\r\nand about as good as new, too; for of course the salt water preserves\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nNoise proves nothing.  Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as\r\nif she had laid an asteroid.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, Sept. 11.  In this world we often make mistakes of judgment.\r\nWe do not as a rule get out of them sound and whole, but sometimes we do.\r\nAt dinner yesterday evening-present, a mixture of Scotch, English,\r\nAmerican, Canadian, and Australasian folk--a discussion broke out about\r\nthe pronunciation of certain Scottish words.  This was private ground,\r\nand the non-Scotch nationalities, with one exception, discreetly kept\r\nstill.  But I am not discreet, and I took a hand.  I didn't know anything\r\nabout the subject, but I took a hand just to have something to do.  At\r\nthat moment the word in dispute was the word three.  One Scotchman was\r\nclaiming that the peasantry of Scotland pronounced it three, his\r\nadversaries claimed that they didn't--that they pronounced it 'thraw'.\r\nThe solitary Scot was having a sultry time of it, so I thought I would\r\nenrich him with my help.  In my position I was necessarily quite\r\nimpartial, and was equally as well and as ill equipped to fight on the\r\none side as on the other.  So I spoke up and said the peasantry\r\npronounced the word three, not thraw.  It was an error of judgment.\r\nThere was a moment of astonished and ominous silence, then weather\r\nensued.  The storm rose and spread in a surprising way, and I was snowed\r\nunder in a very few minutes.  It was a bad defeat for me--a kind of\r\nWaterloo.  It promised to remain so, and I wished I had had better sense\r\nthan to enter upon such a forlorn enterprise.  But just then I had a\r\nsaving thought--at least a thought that offered a chance.  While the\r\nstorm was still raging, I made up a Scotch couplet, and then spoke up and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, don't say any more.  I confess defeat.  I thought I knew, but\r\nI see my mistake.  I was deceived by one of your Scotch poets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Scotch poet!  O come!  Name him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRobert Burns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful the power of that name.  These men looked doubtful--but\r\nparalyzed, all the same.  They were quite silent for a moment; then one\r\nof them said--with the reverence in his voice which is always present in\r\na Scotchman's tone when he utters the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Robbie Burns say--what does he say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what he says:\r\n\r\n         'There were nae bairns but only three\r\n         --Ane at the breast, twa at the knee.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt ended the discussion.  There was no man there profane enough, disloyal\r\nenough, to say any word against a thing which Robert Burns had settled.\r\nI shall always honor that great name for the salvation it brought me in\r\nthis time of my sore need.\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that nearly any invented quotation, played with\r\nconfidence, stands a good chance to deceive.  There are people who think\r\nthat honesty is always the best policy.  This is a superstition; there\r\nare times when the appearance of it is worth six of it.\r\n\r\nWe are moving steadily southward-getting further and further down under\r\nthe projecting paunch of the globe.  Yesterday evening we saw the Big\r\nDipper and the north star sink below the horizon and disappear from our\r\nworld.  No, not \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d but they.  They saw it--somebody saw it--and told\r\nme about it.  But it is no matter, I was not caring for those things, I\r\nam tired of them, any way.  I think they are well enough, but one doesn't\r\nwant them always hanging around.  My interest was all in the Southern\r\nCross.  I had never seen that.  I had heard about it all my life, and it\r\nwas but natural that I should be burning to see it.  No other\r\nconstellation makes so much talk.  I had nothing against the Big Dipper\r\n--and naturally couldn't have anything against it, since it is a citizen\r\nof\r\nour own sky, and the property of the United States--but I did want it to\r\nmove out of the way and give this foreigner a chance.  Judging by the\r\nsize of the talk which the Southern Cross had made, I supposed it would\r\nneed a sky all to itself.\r\n\r\nBut that was a mistake.  We saw the Cross to-night, and it is not large.\r\nNot large, and not strikingly bright.  But it was low down toward the\r\nhorizon, and it may improve when it gets up higher in the sky.  It is\r\ningeniously named, for it looks just as a cross would look if it looked\r\nlike something else.  But that description does not describe; it is too\r\nvague, too general, too indefinite.  It does after a fashion suggest a\r\ncross -- a cross that is out of repair--or out of drawing; not correctly\r\nshaped. It is long, with a short cross-bar, and the cross-bar is canted\r\nout of the straight line.\r\n\r\nIt consists of four large stars and one little one.  The little one is\r\nout of line and further damages the shape.  It should have been placed at\r\nthe intersection of the stem and the cross-bar.  If you do not draw an\r\nimaginary line from star to star it does not suggest a cross--nor\r\nanything in particular.\r\n\r\nOne must ignore the little star, and leave it out of the combination--it\r\nconfuses everything.  If you leave it out, then you can make out of the\r\nfour stars a sort of cross--out of true; or a sort of kite--out of true;\r\nor a sort of coffin-out of true.\r\n\r\nConstellations have always been troublesome things to name.  If you give\r\none of them a fanciful name, it will always refuse to live up to it; it\r\nwill always persist in not resembling the thing it has been named for.\r\nUltimately, to satisfy the public, the fanciful name has to be discarded\r\nfor a common-sense one, a manifestly descriptive one.  The Great Bear\r\nremained the Great Bear--and unrecognizable as such--for thousands of\r\nyears; and people complained about it all the time, and quite properly;\r\nbut as soon as it became the property of the United States, Congress\r\nchanged it to the Big Dipper, and now every body is satisfied, and there\r\nis no more talk about riots.  I would not change the Southern Cross to\r\nthe Southern Coffin, I would change it to the Southern Kite; for up there\r\nin the general emptiness is the proper home of a kite, but not for\r\ncoffins and crosses and dippers.  In a little while, now--I cannot\r\ntell exactly how long it will be--the globe will belong to the\r\nEnglish-speaking race; and of course the skies also.  Then the\r\nconstellations will be re-organized, and polished up, and re-named--the\r\nmost of them \xe2\x80\x9cVictoria,\xe2\x80\x9d I reckon, but this one will sail thereafter as\r\nthe Southern Kite, or go out of business.  Several towns and things, here\r\nand there, have been named for Her Majesty already.\r\n\r\nIn these past few days we are plowing through a mighty Milky Way of\r\nislands.  They are so thick on the map that one would hardly expect to\r\nfind room between them for a canoe; yet we seldom glimpse one.  Once we\r\nsaw the dim bulk of a couple of them, far away, spectral and dreamy\r\nthings; members of the Horne-Alofa and Fortuna.  On the larger one are\r\ntwo rival native kings--and they have a time together.  They are\r\nCatholics; so are their people.  The missionaries there are French\r\npriests.\r\n\r\nFrom the multitudinous islands in these regions the \xe2\x80\x9crecruits\xe2\x80\x9d for the\r\nQueensland plantations were formerly drawn; are still drawn from them, I\r\nbelieve.  Vessels fitted up like old-time slavers came here and carried\r\noff the natives to serve as laborers in the great Australian province.\r\nIn the beginning it was plain, simple man-stealing, as per testimony of\r\nthe missionaries.  This has been denied, but not disproven.  Afterward it\r\nwas forbidden by law to \xe2\x80\x9crecruit\xe2\x80\x9d a native without his consent, and\r\ngovernmental agents were sent in all recruiting vessels to see that the\r\nlaw was obeyed--which they did, according to the recruiting people; and\r\nwhich they sometimes didn't, according to the missionaries.  A man could\r\nbe lawfully recruited for a three-years term of service; he could\r\nvolunteer for another term if he so chose; when his time was up he could\r\nreturn to his island.  And would also have the means to do it; for the\r\ngovernment required the employer to put money in its hands for this\r\npurpose before the recruit was delivered to him.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wawn was a recruiting ship-master during many years.  From his\r\npleasant book one gets the idea that the recruiting business was quite\r\npopular with the islanders, as a rule.  And yet that did not make the\r\nbusiness wholly dull and uninteresting; for one finds rather frequent\r\nlittle breaks in the monotony of it--like this, for instance:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe afternoon of our arrival at Leper Island the schooner was lying\r\n     almost becalmed under the lee of the lofty central portion of the\r\n     island, about three-quarters of a mile from the shore.  The boats\r\n     were in sight at some distance.  The recruiter-boat had run into a\r\n     small nook on the rocky coast, under a high bank, above which stood\r\n     a solitary hut backed by dense forest.  The government agent and\r\n     mate in the second boat lay about 400 yards to the westward.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly we heard the sound of firing, followed by yells from the\r\n     natives on shore, and then we saw the recruiter-boat push out with a\r\n     seemingly diminished crew.  The mate's boat pulled quickly up, took\r\n     her in tow, and presently brought her alongside, all her own crew\r\n     being more or less hurt.  It seems the natives had called them into\r\n     the place on pretence of friendship.  A crowd gathered about the\r\n     stern of the boat, and several fellows even got into her.  All of a\r\n     sudden our men were attacked with clubs and tomahawks.  The\r\n     recruiter escaped the first blows aimed at him, making play with his\r\n     fists until he had an opportunity to draw his revolver.  'Tom\r\n     Sayers,' a Mare man, received a tomahawk blow on the head which laid\r\n     the scalp open but did not penetrate his skull, fortunately.  'Bobby\r\n     Towns,' another Mare boatman, had both his thumbs cut in warding off\r\n     blows, one of them being so nearly severed from the hand that the\r\n     doctors had to finish the operation.  Lihu, a Lifu boy, the\r\n     recruiter's special attendant, was cut and pricked in various\r\n     places, but nowhere seriously.  Jack, an unlucky Tanna recruit, who\r\n     had been engaged to act as boatman, received an arrow through his\r\n     forearm, the head of which--apiece of bone seven or eight inches\r\n     long--was still in the limb, protruding from both sides, when the\r\n     boats returned.  The recruiter himself would have got off scot-free\r\n     had not an arrow pinned one of his fingers to the loom of the\r\n     steering-oar just as they were getting off.  The fight had been\r\n     short but sharp.  The enemy lost two men, both shot dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Captain Wawn furnishes such a crowd of instances of fatal\r\nencounters between natives and French and English recruiting-crews (for\r\nthe French are in the business for the plantations of New Caledonia),\r\nthat one is almost persuaded that recruiting is not thoroughly popular\r\namong the islanders; else why this bristling string of attacks and\r\nbloodcurdling slaughter?  The captain lays it all to \xe2\x80\x9cExeter Hall\r\ninfluence.\xe2\x80\x9d  But for the meddling philanthropists, the native fathers and\r\nmothers would be fond of seeing their children carted into exile and now\r\nand then the grave, instead of weeping about it and trying to kill the\r\nkind recruiters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHe was as shy as a newspaper is when referring to its own merits.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wawn is crystal-clear on one point: He does not approve of\r\nmissionaries.  They obstruct his business.  They make \xe2\x80\x9cRecruiting,\xe2\x80\x9d as he\r\ncalls it (\xe2\x80\x9cSlave-Catching,\xe2\x80\x9d as they call it in their frank way) a trouble\r\nwhen it ought to be just a picnic and a pleasure excursion.  The\r\nmissionaries have their opinion about the manner in which the Labor\r\nTraffic is conducted, and about the recruiter's evasions of the law of\r\nthe Traffic, and about the traffic itself--and it is distinctly\r\nuncomplimentary to the Traffic and to everything connected with it,\r\nincluding the law for its regulation.  Captain Wawn's book is of very\r\nrecent date; I have by me a pamphlet of still later date--hot from the\r\npress, in fact--by Rev. Wm. Gray, a missionary; and the book and the\r\npamphlet taken together make exceedingly interesting reading, to my mind.\r\n\r\nInteresting, and easy to understand--except in one detail, which I will\r\nmention presently.  It is easy to understand why the Queensland sugar\r\nplanter should want the Kanaka recruit: he is cheap.  Very cheap, in\r\nfact.  These are the figures paid by the planter: L20 to the recruiter\r\nfor getting the Kanaka or \xe2\x80\x9ccatching\xe2\x80\x9d him, as the missionary phrase goes;\r\nL3 to the Queensland government for \xe2\x80\x9csuperintending\xe2\x80\x9d the importation; L5\r\ndeposited with the Government for the Kanaka's passage home when his\r\nthree years are up, in case he shall live that long; about L25 to the\r\nKanaka himself for three years' wages and clothing; total payment for the\r\nuse of a man three years, L53; or, including diet, L60.  Altogether, a\r\nhundred dollars a year.  One can understand why the recruiter is fond of\r\nthe business; the recruit costs him a few cheap presents (given to the\r\nrecruit's relatives, not to the recruit himself), and the recruit is\r\nworth L20 to the recruiter when delivered in Queensland.  All this is\r\nclear enough; but\r\nthe thing that is not clear is, what there is about it all to persuade\r\nthe recruit.  He is young and brisk; life at home in his beautiful island\r\nis one lazy, long holiday to him; or if he wants to work he can turn out\r\na couple of bags of copra per week and sell it for four or five shillings\r\na bag.  In Queensland he must get up at dawn and work from eight to\r\ntwelve hours a day in the canefields--in a much hotter climate than he is\r\nused to--and get less than four shillings a week for it.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand his willingness to go to Queensland.  It is a deep\r\npuzzle to me.  Here is the explanation, from the planter's point of view;\r\nat least I gather from the missionary's pamphlet that it is the\r\nplanter's:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he comes from his home he is a savage, pure and simple.  He\r\n     feels no shame at his nakedness and want of adornment.  When he\r\n     returns home he does so well dressed, sporting a Waterbury watch,\r\n     collars, cuffs, boots, and jewelry.  He takes with him one or more\r\n     boxes--[\xe2\x80\x9cBox\xe2\x80\x9d is English for trunk.]--well filled with clothing, a\r\n     musical instrument or two, and perfumery and other articles of\r\n     luxury he has learned to appreciate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor just one moment we have a seeming flash of comprehension of, the\r\nKanaka's reason for exiling himself: he goes away to acquire\r\ncivilization.  Yes, he was naked and not ashamed, now he is clothed and\r\nknows how to be ashamed; he was unenlightened; now he has a Waterbury\r\nwatch; he was unrefined, now he has jewelry, and something to make him\r\nsmell good; he was a nobody, a provincial, now he has been to far\r\ncountries and can show off.\r\n\r\nIt all looks plausible--for a moment.  Then the missionary takes hold of\r\nthis explanation and pulls it to pieces, and dances on it, and damages it\r\nbeyond recognition.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAdmitting that the foregoing description is the average one, the\r\n     average sequel is this: The cuffs and collars, if used at all, are\r\n     carried off by youngsters, who fasten them round the leg, just below\r\n     the knee, as ornaments.  The Waterbury, broken and dirty, finds its\r\n     way to the trader, who gives a trifle for it; or the inside is taken\r\n     out, the wheels strung on a thread and hung round the neck.  Knives,\r\n     axes, calico, and handkerchiefs are divided among friends, and there\r\n     is hardly one of these apiece.  The boxes, the keys often lost on\r\n     the road home, can be bought for 2s. 6d.  They are to be seen\r\n     rotting outside in almost any shore village on Tanna.  (I speak of\r\n     what I have seen.) A returned Kanaka has been furiously angry with\r\n     me because I would not buy his trousers, which he declared were just\r\n     my fit.  He sold them afterwards to one of my Aniwan teachers for\r\n     9d. worth of tobacco--a pair of trousers that probably cost him 8s.\r\n     or 10s. in Queensland.  A coat or shirt is handy for cold weather.\r\n     The white handkerchiefs, the 'senet' (perfumery), the umbrella, and\r\n     perhaps the hat, are kept.  The boots have to take their chance, if\r\n     they do not happen to fit the copra trader.  'Senet' on the hair,\r\n     streaks of paint on the face, a dirty white handkerchief round the\r\n     neck, strips of turtle shell in the ears, a belt, a sheath and\r\n     knife, and an umbrella constitute the rig of returned Kanaka at home\r\n     the day after landing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA hat, an umbrella, a belt, a neckerchief.  Otherwise stark naked.  All\r\nin a day the hard-earned \xe2\x80\x9ccivilization\xe2\x80\x9d has melted away to this.  And\r\neven these perishable things must presently go.  Indeed, there is but a\r\nsingle detail of his civilization that can be depended on to stay by him:\r\naccording to the missionary, he has learned to swear.  This is art, and\r\nart is long, as the poet says.\r\n\r\nIn all countries the laws throw light upon the past.  The Queensland law\r\nfor the regulation of the Labor Traffic is a confession.  It is a\r\nconfession that the evils charged by the missionaries upon the traffic\r\nhad existed in the past, and that they still existed when the law was\r\nmade.  The missionaries make a further charge: that the law is evaded by\r\nthe recruiters, and that the Government Agent sometimes helps them to do\r\nit.  Regulation 31 reveals two things: that sometimes a young fool of a\r\nrecruit gets his senses back, after being persuaded to sign away his\r\nliberty for three years, and dearly wants to get out of the engagement\r\nand stay at home with his own people; and that threats, intimidation, and\r\nforce are used to keep him on board the recruiting-ship, and to hold him\r\nto his contract.  Regulation 31 forbids these coercions.  The law\r\nrequires that he shall be allowed to go free; and another clause of it\r\nrequires the recruiter to set him ashore--per boat, because of the\r\nprevalence of sharks.  Testimony from Rev. Mr. Gray:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThere are 'wrinkles' for taking the penitent Kanaka.  My first\r\n     experience of the Traffic was a case of this kind in 1884.  A vessel\r\n     anchored just out of sight of our station, word was brought to me\r\n     that some boys were stolen, and the relatives wished me to go and\r\n     get them back.  The facts were, as I found, that six boys had\r\n     recruited, had rushed into the boat, the Government Agent informed\r\n     me.  They had all 'signed'; and, said the Government Agent, 'on\r\n     board they shall remain.'  I was assured that the six boys were of\r\n     age and willing to go.  Yet on getting ready to leave the ship I\r\n     found four of the lads ready to come ashore in the boat!  This I\r\n     forbade.  One of them jumped into the water and persisted in coming\r\n     ashore in my boat.  When appealed to, the Government Agent suggested\r\n     that we go and leave him to be picked up by the ship's boat, a\r\n     quarter mile distant at the time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe law and the missionaries feel for the repentant recruit--and\r\nproperly, one may be permitted to think, for he is only a youth and\r\nignorant and persuadable to his hurt--but sympathy for him is not kept in\r\nstock by the recruiter.  Rev. Mr. Gray says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA captain many years in the traffic explained to me how a penitent\r\n     could betaken.  'When a boy jumps overboard we just take a boat and\r\n     pull ahead of him, then lie between him and the shore.  If he has\r\n     not tired himself swimming, and passes the boat, keep on heading him\r\n     in this way.  The dodge rarely fails.  The boy generally tires of\r\n     swimming, gets into the boat of his own accord, and goes quietly on\r\n     board.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, exhaustion is likely to make a boy quiet.  If the distressed boy had\r\nbeen the speaker's son, and the captors savages, the speaker would have\r\nbeen surprised to see how differently the thing looked from the new point\r\nof view; however, it is not our custom to put ourselves in the other\r\nperson's place.  Somehow there is something pathetic about that\r\ndisappointed young savage's resignation.  I must explain, here, that in\r\nthe traffic dialect, \xe2\x80\x9cboy\xe2\x80\x9d does not always mean boy; it means a youth\r\nabove sixteen years of age.  That is by Queensland law the age of\r\nconsent, though it is held that recruiters allow themselves some latitude\r\nin guessing at ages.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wawn of the free spirit chafes under the annoyance of \xe2\x80\x9ccast-iron\r\nregulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  They and the missionaries have poisoned his life.  He\r\ngrieves for the good old days, vanished to come no more.  See him weep;\r\nhear him cuss between the lines!\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFor a long time we were allowed to apprehend and detain all\r\n     deserters who had signed the agreement on board ship, but the\r\n     'cast-iron' regulations of the Act of 1884 put a stop to that,\r\n     allowing the Kanaka to sign the agreement for three years' service,\r\n     travel about in the ship in receipt of the regular rations, cadge\r\n     all he could, and leave when he thought fit, so long as he did not\r\n     extend his pleasure trip to Queensland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Gray calls this same restrictive cast-iron law a \xe2\x80\x9cfarce.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\nis as much cruelty and injustice done to natives by acts that are legal\r\nas by deeds unlawful.  The regulations that exist are unjust and\r\ninadequate--unjust and inadequate they must ever be.\xe2\x80\x9d  He furnishes his\r\nreasons for his position, but they are too long for reproduction here.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the most a Kanaka advantages himself by a three-years course\r\nin civilization in Queensland, is a necklace and an umbrella and a showy\r\nimperfection in the art of swearing, it must be that all the profit of\r\nthe traffic goes to the white man.  This could be twisted into a\r\nplausible argument that the traffic ought to be squarely abolished.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is reason for hope that that can be left alone to achieve\r\nitself.  It is claimed that the traffic will depopulate its sources of\r\nsupply within the next twenty or thirty years.  Queensland is a very\r\nhealthy place for white people--death-rate 12 in 1,000 of the population\r\n--but the Kanaka death-rate is away above that.  The vital statistics for\r\n1893 place it at 52; for 1894 (Mackay district), 68.  The first six\r\nmonths of the Kanaka's exile are peculiarly perilous for him because of\r\nthe rigors of the new climate.  The death-rate among the new men has\r\nreached as high as 180 in the 1,000.  In the Kanaka's native home his\r\ndeath-rate is 12 in time of peace, and 15 in time of war.  Thus exile to\r\nQueensland--with the opportunity to acquire civilization, an umbrella,\r\nand a pretty poor quality of profanity--is twelve times as deadly for him\r\nas war.  Common Christian charity, common humanity, does seem to require,\r\nnot only that these people be returned to their homes, but that war,\r\npestilence, and famine be introduced among them for their preservation.\r\n\r\nConcerning these Pacific isles and their peoples an eloquent prophet\r\nspoke long years ago--five and fifty years ago.  In fact, he spoke a\r\nlittle too early.  Prophecy is a good line of business, but it is full of\r\nrisks.  This prophet was the Right Rev. M. Russell, LL.D., D.C.L., of\r\nEdinburgh:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIs the tide of civilization to roll only to the foot of the Rocky\r\n     Mountains, and is the sun of knowledge to set at last in the waves\r\n     of the Pacific?  No; the mighty day of four thousand years is\r\n     drawing to its close; the sun of humanity has performed its destined\r\n     course; but long ere its setting rays are extinguished in the west,\r\n     its ascending beams have glittered on the isles of the eastern seas\r\n     .  .  .  .  And now we see the race of Japhet setting forth to\r\n     people the isles, and the seeds of another Europe and a second\r\n     England sown in the regions of the sun.  But mark the words of the\r\n     prophecy: 'He shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be\r\n     his servant.'  It is not said Canaan shall be his slave.  To the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon race is given the scepter of the globe, but there is not\r\n     given either the lash of the slave-driver or the rack of the\r\n     executioner.  The East will not be stained with the same atrocities\r\n     as the West; the frightful gangrene of an enthralled race is not to\r\n     mar the destinies of the family of Japhet in the Oriental world;\r\n     humanizing, not destroying, as they advance; uniting with, not\r\n     enslaving, the inhabitants with whom they dwell, the British race\r\n     may,\xe2\x80\x9d  etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAnd he closes his vision with an invocation from Thomson:\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x9cCome, bright Improvement! on the car of Time,\r\n          And rule the spacious world from clime to clime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVery well, Bright Improvement has arrived, you see, with her\r\ncivilization, and her Waterbury, and her umbrella, and her third-quality\r\nprofanity, and her humanizing-not-destroying machinery, and her\r\nhundred-and-eighty death-rate, and everything is going along just as\r\nhandsome!\r\n\r\nBut the prophet that speaks last has an advantage over the pioneer in the\r\nbusiness.  Rev. Mr. Gray says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I am concerned about is that we as a Christian nation should\r\n     wipe out these races to enrich ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he closes his pamphlet with a grim Indictment which is as eloquent in\r\nits flowerless straightforward English as is the hand-painted rhapsody of\r\nthe early prophet:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMy indictment of the Queensland-Kanaka Labor Traffic is this\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c1. It generally demoralizes and always impoverishes the Kanaka,\r\n     deprives him of his citizenship, and depopulates the islands fitted\r\n     to his home.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c2. It is felt to lower the dignity of the white agricultural\r\n     laborer in Queensland, and beyond a doubt it lowers his wages there.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c3. The whole system is fraught with danger to Australia and the\r\n     islands on the score of health.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c4. On social and political grounds the continuance of the\r\n     Queensland Kanaka Labor Traffic must be a barrier to the true\r\n     federation of the Australian colonies.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c5. The Regulations under which the Traffic exists in Queensland are\r\n     inadequate to prevent abuses, and in the nature of things they must\r\n     remain so.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c6. The whole system is contrary to the spirit and doctrine of the\r\n     Gospel of Jesus Christ.  The Gospel requires us to help the weak,\r\n     but the Kanaka is fleeced and trodden down.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c7. The bed-rock of this Traffic is that the life and liberty of a\r\n     black man are of less value than those of a white man.  And a\r\n     Traffic that has grown out of 'slave-hunting' will certainly remain\r\n     to the end not unlike its origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTruth is the most valuable thing we have.  Let us economize it.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nFrom Diary:--For a day or two we have been plowing among an invisible\r\nvast wilderness of islands, catching now and then a shadowy glimpse of a\r\nmember of it.  There does seem to be a prodigious lot of islands this\r\nyear; the map of this region is freckled and fly-specked all over with\r\nthem.  Their number would seem to be uncountable.  We are moving among\r\nthe Fijis now--224 islands and islets in the group.  In front of us, to\r\nthe west, the wilderness stretches toward Australia, then curves upward\r\nto New Guinea, and still up and up to Japan; behind us, to the east, the\r\nwilderness stretches sixty degrees across the wastes of the Pacific;\r\nsouth of us is New Zealand.  Somewhere or other among these myriads Samoa\r\nis concealed, and not discoverable on the map.  Still, if you wish to go\r\nthere, you will have no trouble about finding it if you follow the\r\ndirections given by Robert Louis Stevenson to Dr. Conan Doyle and to Mr.\r\nJ. M. Barrie.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou go to America, cross the continent to San Francisco,\r\nand then it's the second turning to the left.\xe2\x80\x9d  To get the full flavor of\r\nthe joke one must take a glance at the map.\r\n\r\nWednesday, September 11.--Yesterday we passed close to an island or so,\r\nand recognized the published Fiji characteristics: a broad belt of clean\r\nwhite coral sand around the island; back of it a graceful fringe of\r\nleaning palms, with native huts nestling cosily among the shrubbery at\r\ntheir bases; back of these a stretch of level land clothed in tropic\r\nvegetation; back of that, rugged and picturesque mountains.  A detail\r\nof the immediate foreground: a mouldering ship perched high up on a\r\nreef-bench.  This completes the composition, and makes the picture\r\nartistically perfect.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we sighted Suva, the capital of the group, and threaded\r\nour way into the secluded little harbor--a placid basin of brilliant blue\r\nand green water tucked snugly in among the sheltering hills.  A few ships\r\nrode at anchor in it--one of them a sailing vessel flying the American\r\nflag; and they said she came from Duluth!  There's a journey!  Duluth is\r\nseveral thousand miles from the sea, and yet she is entitled to the proud\r\nname of Mistress of the Commercial Marine of the United States of\r\nAmerica.  There is only one free, independent, unsubsidized American ship\r\nsailing the foreign seas, and Duluth owns it.  All by itself that ship is\r\nthe American fleet.  All by itself it causes the American name and power\r\nto be respected in the far regions of the globe.  All by itself it\r\ncertifies to the world that the most populous civilized nation, in the\r\nearth has a just pride in her stupendous stretch of sea-front, and is\r\ndetermined to assert and maintain her rightful place as one of the Great\r\nMaritime Powers of the Planet.  All by itself it is making foreign eyes\r\nfamiliar with a Flag which they have not seen before for forty years,\r\noutside of the museum.  For what Duluth has done, in building, equipping,\r\nand maintaining at her sole expense the American Foreign Commercial\r\nFleet, and in thus rescuing the American name from shame and lifting it\r\nhigh for the homage of the nations, we owe her a debt of gratitude which\r\nour hearts shall confess with quickened beats whenever her name is named\r\nhenceforth.  Many national toasts will die in the lapse of time, but\r\nwhile the flag flies and the Republic survives, they who live under their\r\nshelter will still drink this one, standing and uncovered: Health and\r\nprosperity to Thee, O Duluth, American Queen of the Alien Seas!\r\n\r\nRow-boats began to flock from the shore; their crews were the first\r\nnatives we had seen.  These men carried no overplus of clothing, and this\r\nwas wise, for the weather was hot.  Handsome, great dusky men they were,\r\nmuscular, clean-limbed, and with faces full of character and\r\nintelligence.  It would be hard to find their superiors anywhere among\r\nthe dark races, I should think.\r\n\r\nEverybody went ashore to look around, and spy out the land, and have that\r\nluxury of luxuries to sea-voyagers--a land-dinner.  And there we saw more\r\nnatives: Wrinkled old women, with their flat mammals flung over their\r\nshoulders, or hanging down in front like the cold-weather drip from the\r\nmolasses-faucet; plump and smily young girls, blithe and content, easy\r\nand graceful, a pleasure to look at; young matrons, tall, straight,\r\ncomely, nobly built, sweeping by with chin up, and a gait incomparable\r\nfor unconscious stateliness and dignity; majestic young men--athletes for\r\nbuild and muscle--clothed in a loose arrangement of dazzling white, with\r\nbronze breast and bronze legs naked, and the head a cannon-swab of solid\r\nhair combed straight out from the skull and dyed a rich brick-red.  Only\r\nsixty years ago they were sunk in darkness; now they have the bicycle.\r\nWe strolled about the streets of the white folks' little town, and around\r\nover the hills by paths and roads among European dwellings and gardens\r\nand plantations, and past clumps of hibiscus that made a body blink, the\r\ngreat blossoms were so intensely red; and by and by we stopped to ask an\r\nelderly English colonist a question or two, and to sympathize with him\r\nconcerning the torrid weather; but he was surprised, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis?  This is not hot.  You ought to be here in the summer time once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe supposed that this was summer; it has the ear-marks of it.  You could\r\ntake it to almost any country and deceive people with it.  But if it\r\nisn't summer, what does it lack?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt lacks half a year.  This is mid-winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been suffering from colds for several months, and a sudden change\r\nof season, like this, could hardly fail to do me hurt.  It brought on\r\nanother cold.  It is odd, these sudden jumps from season to season.  A\r\nfortnight ago we left America in mid-summer, now it is midwinter; about a\r\nweek hence we shall arrive in Australia in the spring.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I found in the billiard-room a resident whom I had known\r\nsomewhere else in the world, and presently made some new friends and\r\ndrove with them out into the country to visit his Excellency the head of\r\nthe State, who was occupying his country residence, to escape the rigors\r\nof the winter weather, I suppose, for it was on breezy high ground and\r\nmuch more comfortable than the lower regions, where the town is, and\r\nwhere the winter has full swing, and often sets a person's hair afire\r\nwhen he takes off his hat to bow.  There is a noble and beautiful view of\r\nocean and islands and castellated peaks from the governor's high-placed\r\nhouse, and its immediate surroundings lie drowsing in that dreamy repose\r\nand serenity which are the charm of life in the Pacific Islands.\r\n\r\nOne of the new friends who went out there with me was a large man, and I\r\nhad been admiring his size all the way.  I was still admiring it as he\r\nstood by the governor on the veranda, talking; then the Fijian butler\r\nstepped out there to announce tea, and dwarfed him.  Maybe he did not\r\nquite dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was quite striking.\r\nPerhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of political\r\nsuspension.  I think that in the talk there on the veranda it was said\r\nthat in Fiji, as in the Sandwich Islands, native kings and chiefs are of\r\nmuch grander size and build than the commoners.  This man was clothed in\r\nflowing white vestments, and they were just the thing for him; they\r\ncomported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity.\r\nEuropean clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace.  I\r\nknow that, because they do that with everybody that wears them.\r\n\r\nIt was said that the old-time devotion to chiefs and reverence for their\r\npersons still survive in the native commoner, and in great force.  The\r\neducated young gentleman who is chief of the tribe that live in the\r\nregion about the capital dresses in the fashion of high-class European\r\ngentlemen, but even his clothes cannot damn him in the reverence of his\r\npeople.  Their pride in his lofty rank and ancient lineage lives on, in\r\nspite of his lost authority and the evil magic of his tailor.  He has no\r\nneed to defile himself with work, or trouble his heart with the sordid\r\ncares of life; the tribe will see to it that he shall not want, and that\r\nhe shall hold up his head and live like a gentleman.  I had a glimpse of\r\nhim down in the town.  Perhaps he is a descendant of the last king--the\r\nking with the difficult name whose memory is preserved by a notable\r\nmonument of cut-stone which one sees in the enclosure in the middle of\r\nthe town.  Thakombau--I remember, now; that is the name.  It is easier to\r\npreserve it on a granite block than in your head.\r\n\r\nFiji was ceded to England by this king in 1858.  One of the gentlemen\r\npresent at the governor's quoted a remark made by the king at the time of\r\nthe session--a neat retort, and with a touch of pathos in it, too.  The\r\nEnglish Commissioner had offered a crumb of comfort to Thakombau by\r\nsaying that the transfer of the kingdom to Great Britain was merely \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\nsort of hermit-crab formality, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said poor Thakombau,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut with this difference--the crab moves into an unoccupied shell, but\r\nmine isn't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, as far as I can make out from the books, the King was between\r\nthe devil and the deep sea at the time, and hadn't much choice.  He owed\r\nthe United States a large debt--a debt which he could pay if allowed\r\ntime, but time was denied him.  He must pay up right away or the warships\r\nwould be upon him.  To protect his people from this disaster he ceded his\r\ncountry to Britain, with a clause in the contract providing for the\r\nultimate payment of the American debt.\r\n\r\nIn old times the Fijians were fierce fighters; they were very religious,\r\nand worshiped idols; the big chiefs were proud and haughty, and they were\r\nmen of great style in many ways; all chiefs had several wives, the\r\nbiggest chiefs sometimes had as many as fifty; when a chief was dead and\r\nready for burial, four or five of his wives were strangled and put into\r\nthe grave with him.  In 1804 twenty-seven British convicts escaped from\r\nAustralia to Fiji, and brought guns and ammunition with them.  Consider\r\nwhat a power they were, armed like that, and what an opportunity they\r\nhad.  If they had been energetic men and sober, and had had brains and\r\nknown how to use them, they could have achieved the sovereignty of the\r\narchipelago(--)twenty-seven kings and each with eight or nine islands\r\nunder\r\nhis scepter.  But nothing came of this chance.  They lived worthless\r\nlives of sin and luxury, and died without honor--in most cases by\r\nviolence.  Only one of them had any ambition; he was an Irishman named\r\nConnor.  He tried to raise a family of fifty children, and scored\r\nforty-eight.  He died lamenting his failure.  It was a foolish sort\r\nof avarice.  Many a father would have been rich enough with forty.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine race, the Fijians, with brains in their heads, and an\r\ninquiring turn of mind.  It appears that their savage ancestors had a\r\ndoctrine of immortality in their scheme of religion--with limitations.\r\nThat is to say, their dead friend would go to a happy hereafter if he\r\ncould be accumulated, but not otherwise.  They drew the line; they\r\nthought that the missionary's doctrine was too sweeping, too\r\ncomprehensive.  They called his attention to certain facts.  For\r\ninstance, many of their friends had been devoured by sharks; the sharks,\r\nin their turn, were caught and eaten by other men; later, these men were\r\ncaptured in war, and eaten by the enemy.  The original persons had\r\nentered into the composition of the sharks; next, they and the sharks had\r\nbecome part of the flesh and blood and bone of the cannibals.  How, then,\r\ncould the particles of the original men be searched out from the final\r\nconglomerate and put together again?  The inquirers were full of doubts,\r\nand considered that the missionary had not examined the matter with the\r\ngravity and attention which so serious a thing deserved.\r\n\r\nThe missionary taught these exacting savages many valuable things, and\r\ngot from them one--a very dainty and poetical idea: Those wild and\r\nignorant poor children of Nature believed that the flowers, after they\r\nperish, rise on the winds and float away to the fair fields of heaven,\r\nand flourish there forever in immortal beauty!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nIt could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no\r\ndistinctly native American criminal class except Congress.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWhen one glances at the map the members of the stupendous island\r\nwilderness of the Pacific seem to crowd upon each other; but no, there is\r\nno crowding, even in the center of a group; and between groups there are\r\nlonely wide deserts of sea.  Not everything is known about the islands,\r\ntheir peoples and their languages.  A startling reminder of this is\r\nfurnished by the fact that in Fiji, twenty years ago, were living two\r\nstrange and solitary beings who came from an unknown country and spoke an\r\nunknown language.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey were picked up by a passing vessel many hundreds\r\nof miles from any known land, floating in the same tiny canoe in which\r\nthey had been blown out to sea.  When found they were but skin and bone.\r\nNo one could understand what they said, and they have never named their\r\ncountry; or, if they have, the name does not correspond with that of any\r\nisland on any chart.  They are now fat and sleek, and as happy as the day\r\nis long.  In the ship's log there is an entry of the latitude and\r\nlongitude in which they were found, and this is probably all the clue\r\nthey will ever have to their lost homes.\xe2\x80\x9d--[Forbes's \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Years in\r\nFiji.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\nWhat a strange and romantic episode it is; and how one is tortured with\r\ncuriosity to know whence those mysterious creatures came, those Men\r\nWithout a Country, errant waifs who cannot name their lost home,\r\nwandering Children of Nowhere.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Island Wilderness is the very home of romance and dreams and\r\nmystery.  The loneliness, the solemnity, the beauty, and the deep repose\r\nof this wilderness have a charm which is all their own for the bruised\r\nspirit of men who have fought and failed in the struggle for life in the\r\ngreat world; and for men who have been hunted out of the great world for\r\ncrime; and for other men who love an easy and indolent existence; and for\r\nothers who love a roving free life, and stir and change and adventure;\r\nand for yet others who love an easy and comfortable career of trading and\r\nmoney-getting, mixed with plenty of loose matrimony by purchase, divorce\r\nwithout trial or expense, and limitless spreeing thrown in to make life\r\nideally perfect.\r\n\r\nWe sailed again, refreshed.\r\n\r\nThe most cultivated person in the ship was a young Englishman whose\r\nhome was in New Zealand.  He was a naturalist.  His learning in his\r\nspecialty was deep and thorough, his interest in his subject amounted to\r\na passion, he had an easy gift of speech; and so, when he talked about\r\nanimals it was a pleasure to listen to him.  And profitable, too, though\r\nhe was sometimes difficult to understand because now and then he used\r\nscientific technicalities which were above the reach of some of us.  They\r\nwere pretty sure to be above my reach, but as he was quite willing to\r\nexplain them I always made it a point to get him to do it.  I had a fair\r\nknowledge of his subject--layman's knowledge--to begin with, but it was\r\nhis teachings which crystalized it into scientific form and clarity--in a\r\nword, gave it value.\r\n\r\nHis special interest was the fauna of Australasia, and his knowledge of\r\nthe matter was as exhaustive as it was accurate.  I already knew a good\r\ndeal about the rabbits in Australasia and their marvelous fecundity, but\r\nin my talks with him I found that my estimate of the great hindrance and\r\nobstruction inflicted by the rabbit pest upon traffic and travel was far\r\nshort of the facts.  He told me that the first pair of rabbits imported\r\ninto Australasia bred so wonderfully that within six months rabbits were\r\nso thick in the land that people had to dig trenches through them to get\r\nfrom town to town.\r\n\r\nHe told me a great deal about worms, and the kangaroo, and other\r\ncoleoptera, and said he knew the history and ways of all such\r\npachydermata.  He said the kangaroo had pockets, and carried its young in\r\nthem when it couldn't get apples.  And he said that the emu was as big as\r\nan ostrich, and looked like one, and had an amorphous appetite and would\r\neat bricks.  Also, that the dingo was not a dingo at all, but just a wild\r\ndog; and that the only difference between a dingo and a dodo was that\r\nneither of them barked; otherwise they were just the same.  He said that\r\nthe only game-bird in Australia was the wombat, and the only song-bird\r\nthe larrikin, and that both were protected by government.  The most\r\nbeautiful of the native birds was the bird of Paradise.  Next came the\r\ntwo kinds of lyres; not spelt the same.  He said the one kind was dying\r\nout, the other thickening up.  He explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cSundowner\xe2\x80\x9d was not\r\na bird it was a man; sundowner was merely the Australian equivalent of\r\nour word, tramp.  He is a loafer, a hard drinker, and a sponge.  He\r\ntramps across the country in the sheep-shearing season, pretending to\r\nlook for work; but he always times himself to arrive at a sheep-run just\r\nat sundown, when the day's labor ends; all he wants is whisky and supper\r\nand bed and breakfast; he gets them and then disappears.  The naturalist\r\nspoke of the bell bird, the creature that at short intervals all day\r\nrings out its mellow and exquisite peal from the deeps of the forest.  It\r\nis the favorite and best friend of the weary and thirsty sundowner; for\r\nhe knows that wherever the bell bird is, there is water; and he goes\r\nsomewhere else.  The naturalist said that the oddest bird in Australasia\r\nwas the Laughing Jackass, and the biggest the now extinct Great Moa.\r\n\r\nThe Moa stood thirteen feet high, and could step over an ordinary man's\r\nhead or kick his hat off; and his head, too, for that matter.  He said it\r\nwas wingless, but a swift runner.  The natives used to ride it.  It could\r\nmake forty miles an hour, and keep it up for four hundred miles and come\r\nout reasonably fresh.  It was still in existence when the railway was\r\nintroduced into New Zealand; still in existence, and carrying the mails.\r\nThe railroad began with the same schedule it has now: two expresses a\r\nweek-time, twenty miles an hour.  The company exterminated the moa to get\r\nthe mails.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the indigenous coneys and bactrian camels, the naturalist\r\nsaid that the coniferous and bacteriological output of Australasia was\r\nremarkable for its many and curious departures from the accepted laws\r\ngoverning these species of tubercles, but that in his opinion Nature's\r\nfondness for dabbling in the erratic was most notably exhibited in that\r\ncurious combination of bird, fish, amphibian, burrower, crawler,\r\nquadruped, and Christian called the Ornithorhynchus--grotesquest of\r\nanimals, king of the animalculae of the world for versatility of\r\ncharacter and make-up.  Said he:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cYou can call it anything you want to, and be right.  It is a fish,\r\n     for it lives in the river half the time; it is a land animal, for it\r\n     resides on the land half the time; it is an amphibian, since it\r\n     likes both and does not know which it prefers; it is a hybernian,\r\n     for when times are dull and nothing much going on it buries itself\r\n     under the mud at the bottom of a puddle and hybernates there a\r\n     couple of weeks at a time; it is a kind of duck, for it has a\r\n     duck-bill and four webbed paddles; it is a fish and quadruped\r\n     together, for in the water it swims with the paddles and on shore it\r\n     paws itself across country with them; it is a kind of seal, for it\r\n     has a seal's fur; it is carnivorous, herbivorous, insectivorous, and\r\n     vermifuginous, for it eats fish and grass and butterflies, and in\r\n     the season digs worms out of the mud and devours them; it is clearly\r\n     a bird, for it lays eggs, and hatches them; it is clearly a mammal,\r\n     for it nurses its young; and it is manifestly a kind of Christian,\r\n     for it keeps the Sabbath when there is anybody around, and when\r\n     there isn't, doesn't.  It has all the tastes there are except\r\n     refined ones, it has all the habits there are except good ones.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a survival--a survival of the fittest.  Mr. Darwin invented\r\n     the theory that goes by that name, but the Ornithorhynchus was the\r\n     first to put it to actual experiment and prove that it could be\r\n     done.  Hence it should have as much of the credit as Mr. Darwin.\r\n     It was never in the Ark; you will find no mention of it there; it\r\n     nobly stayed out and worked the theory.  Of all creatures in the\r\n     world it was the only one properly equipped for the test.  The Ark\r\n     was thirteen months afloat, and all the globe submerged; no land\r\n     visible above the flood, no vegetation, no food for a mammal to eat,\r\n     nor water for a mammal to drink; for all mammal food was destroyed,\r\n     and when the pure floods from heaven and the salt oceans of the\r\n     earth mingled their waters and rose above the mountain tops, the\r\n     result was a drink which no bird or beast of ordinary construction\r\n     could use and live.  But this combination was nuts for the\r\n     Ornithorhynchus, if I may use a term like that without offense.\r\n     Its river home had always been salted by the flood-tides of the sea.\r\n     On the face of the Noachian deluge innumerable forest trees were\r\n     floating.  Upon these the Ornithorhynchus voyaged in peace; voyaged\r\n     from clime to clime, from hemisphere to hemisphere, in contentment\r\n     and comfort, in virile interest in the constant change of scene, in\r\n     humble thankfulness for its privileges, in ever-increasing\r\n     enthusiasm in the development of the great theory upon whose\r\n     validity it had staked its life, its fortunes, and its sacred honor,\r\n     if I may use such expressions without impropriety in connection with\r\n     an episode of this nature.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt lived the tranquil and luxurious life of a creature of\r\n     independent means.  Of things actually necessary to its existence\r\n     and its happiness not a detail was wanting.  When it wished to walk,\r\n     it scrambled along the tree-trunk; it mused in the shade of the\r\n     leaves by day, it slept in their shelter by night; when it wanted\r\n     the refreshment of a swim, it had it; it ate leaves when it wanted a\r\n     vegetable diet, it dug under the bark for worms and grubs; when it\r\n     wanted fish it caught them, when it wanted eggs it laid them.  If\r\n     the grubs gave out in one tree it swam to another; and as for fish,\r\n     the very opulence of the supply was an embarrassment.  And finally,\r\n     when it was thirsty it smacked its chops in gratitude over a blend\r\n     that would have slain a crocodile.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen at last, after thirteen months of travel and research in all\r\n     the Zones it went aground on a mountain-summit, it strode ashore,\r\n     saying in its heart, 'Let them that come after me invent theories\r\n     and dream dreams about the Survival of the Fittest if they like, but\r\n     I am the first that has done it!\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThis wonderful creature dates back like the kangaroo and many other\r\n     Australian hydrocephalous invertebrates, to an age long anterior to\r\n     the advent of man upon the earth; they date back, indeed, to a time\r\n     when a causeway hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long,\r\n     joined Australia to Africa, and the animals of the two countries\r\n     were alike, and all belonged to that remote geological epoch known\r\n     to science as the Old Red Grindstone Post-Pleosaurian.  Later the\r\n     causeway sank under the sea; subterranean convulsions lifted the\r\n     African continent a thousand feet higher than it was before, but\r\n     Australia kept her old level.  In Africa's new climate the animals\r\n     necessarily began to develop and shade off into new forms and\r\n     families and species, but the animals of Australia as necessarily\r\n     remained stationary, and have so remained until this day.  In the\r\n     course of some millions of years the African Ornithorhynchus\r\n     developed and developed and developed, and sluffed off detail after\r\n     detail of its make-up until at last the creature became wholly\r\n     disintegrated and scattered.  Whenever you see a bird or a beast or\r\n     a seal or an otter in Africa you know that he is merely a sorry\r\n     surviving fragment of that sublime original of whom I have been\r\n     speaking--that creature which was everything in general and nothing\r\n     in particular--the opulently endowed 'e pluribus unum' of the animal\r\n     world.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSuch is the history of the most hoary, the most ancient, the most\r\n     venerable creature that exists in the earth today--Ornithorhynchus\r\n     Platypus Extraordinariensis--whom God preserve!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he was strongly moved he could rise and soar like that with ease.\r\nAnd not only in the prose form, but in the poetical as well.  He had\r\nwritten many pieces of poetry in his time, and these manuscripts he lent\r\naround among the passengers, and was willing to let them be copied.  It\r\nseemed to me that the least technical one in the series, and the one\r\nwhich reached the loftiest note, perhaps, was his:\r\n\r\n               INVOCATION.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCome forth from thy oozy couch,\r\n     O Ornithorhynchus dear!\r\n     And greet with a cordial claw\r\n     The stranger that longs to hear\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFrom thy own own lips the tale\r\n     Of thy origin all unknown:\r\n     Thy misplaced bone where flesh should be\r\n     And flesh where should be bone;\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd fishy fin where should be paw,\r\n     And beaver-trowel tail,\r\n     And snout of beast equip'd with teeth\r\n     Where gills ought to prevail.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCome, Kangaroo, the good and true\r\n     Foreshortened as to legs,\r\n     And body tapered like a churn,\r\n     And sack marsupial, i' fegs,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd tells us why you linger here,\r\n     Thou relic of a vanished time,\r\n     When all your friends as fossils sleep,\r\n     Immortalized in lime!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no poet is a conscious plagiarist; but there seems to be warrant\r\nfor suspecting that there is no poet who is not at one time or another an\r\nunconscious one.  The above verses are indeed beautiful, and, in a way,\r\ntouching; but there is a haunting something about them which unavoidably\r\nsuggests the Sweet Singer of Michigan.  It can hardly be doubted that the\r\nauthor had read the works of that poet and been impressed by them.  It is\r\nnot apparent that he has borrowed from them any word or yet any phrase,\r\nbut the style and swing and mastery and melody of the Sweet Singer all\r\nare there.  Compare this Invocation with \xe2\x80\x9cFrank Dutton\xe2\x80\x9d--particularly\r\nstanzas first and seventeenth--and I think the reader will feel convinced\r\nthat he who wrote the one had read the other:\r\n\r\n     I.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cFrank Dutton was as fine a lad\r\n     As ever you wish to see,\r\n     And he was drowned in Pine Island Lake\r\n     On earth no more will he be,\r\n     His age was near fifteen years,\r\n     And he was a motherless boy,\r\n     He was living with his grandmother\r\n     When he was drowned, poor boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n     XVII.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cHe was drowned on Tuesday afternoon,\r\n     On Sunday he was found,\r\n     And the tidings of that drowned boy\r\n     Was heard for miles around.\r\n     His form was laid by his mother's side,\r\n     Beneath the cold, cold ground,\r\n     His friends for him will drop a tear\r\n     When they view his little mound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     The Sentimental Song Book.  By Mrs. Julia Moore, p. 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nIt is your human environment that makes climate.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nSept. 15--Night.  Close to Australia now.  Sydney 50 miles distant.\r\n\r\nThat note recalls an experience.  The passengers were sent for, to come\r\nup in the bow and see a fine sight.  It was very dark.  One could not\r\nfollow with the eye the surface of the sea more than fifty yards in any\r\ndirection it dimmed away and became lost to sight at about that distance\r\nfrom us.  But if you patiently gazed into the darkness a little while,\r\nthere was a sure reward for you.  Presently, a quarter of a mile away you\r\nwould see a blinding splash or explosion of light on the water--a flash\r\nso sudden and so astonishingly brilliant that it would make you catch\r\nyour breath; then that blotch of light would instantly extend itself and\r\ntake the corkscrew shape and imposing length of the fabled sea-serpent,\r\nwith every curve of its body and the \xe2\x80\x9cbreak\xe2\x80\x9d spreading away from its\r\nhead, and the wake following behind its tail clothed in a fierce splendor\r\nof living fire.  And my, but it was coming at a lightning gait!  Almost\r\nbefore you could think, this monster of light, fifty feet long, would go\r\nflaming and storming by, and suddenly disappear.  And out in the distance\r\nwhence he came you would see another flash; and another and another and\r\nanother, and see them turn into sea-serpents on the instant; and once\r\nsixteen flashed up at the same time and came tearing towards us, a swarm\r\nof wiggling curves, a moving conflagration, a vision of bewildering\r\nbeauty, a spectacle of fire and energy whose equal the most of those\r\npeople will not see again until after they are dead.\r\n\r\nIt was porpoises--porpoises aglow with phosphorescent light.  They\r\npresently collected in a wild and magnificent jumble under the bows, and\r\nthere they played for an hour, leaping and frollicking and carrying on,\r\nturning summersaults in front of the stem or across it and never getting\r\nhit, never making a miscalculation, though the stem missed them only\r\nabout an inch, as a rule.  They were porpoises of the ordinary length\r\n--eight or ten feet--but every twist of their bodies sent a long\r\nprocession of united and glowing curves astern.  That fiery jumble was\r\nan enchanting thing to look at, and we stayed out the performance; one\r\ncannot have such a show as that twice in a lifetime.  The porpoise is the\r\nkitten of the sea; he never has a serious thought, he cares for nothing\r\nbut fun and play.  But I think I never saw him at his winsomest until\r\nthat night. It was near a center of civilization, and he could have been\r\ndrinking.\r\n\r\nBy and by, when we had approached to somewhere within thirty miles of\r\nSydney Heads the great electric light that is posted on one of those\r\nlofty ramparts began to show, and in time the little spark grew to a\r\ngreat sun and pierced the firmament of darkness with a far-reaching sword\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nSydney Harbor is shut in behind a precipice that extends some miles like\r\na wall, and exhibits no break to the ignorant stranger.  It has a break\r\nin the middle, but it makes so little show that even Captain Cook sailed\r\nby it without seeing it.  Near by that break is a false break which\r\nresembles it, and which used to make trouble for the mariner at night, in\r\nthe early days before the place was lighted.  It caused the memorable\r\ndisaster to the Duncan Dunbar, one of the most pathetic tragedies in the\r\nhistory of that pitiless ruffian, the sea.  The ship was a sailing\r\nvessel; a fine and favorite passenger packet, commanded by a popular\r\ncaptain of high reputation.  She was due from England, and Sydney was\r\nwaiting, and counting the hours; counting the hours, and making ready to\r\ngive her a heart-stirring welcome; for she was bringing back a great\r\ncompany of mothers and daughters, the long-missed light and bloom of life\r\nof Sydney homes; daughters that had been years absent at school, and\r\nmothers that had been with them all that time watching over them.  Of all\r\nthe world only India and Australasia have by custom freighted ships and\r\nfleets with their hearts, and know the tremendous meaning of that phrase;\r\nonly they know what the waiting is like when this freightage is entrusted\r\nto the fickle winds, not steam, and what the joy is like when the ship\r\nthat is returning this treasure comes safe to port and the long dread is\r\nover.\r\n\r\nOn board the Duncan Dunbar, flying toward Sydney Heads in the waning\r\nafternoon, the happy home-comers made busy preparation, for it was not\r\ndoubted that they would be in the arms of their friends before the day\r\nwas done; they put away their sea-going clothes and put on clothes meeter\r\nfor the meeting, their richest and their loveliest, these poor brides of\r\nthe grave.  But the wind lost force, or there was a miscalculation, and\r\nbefore the Heads were sighted the darkness came on.  It was said that\r\nordinarily the captain would have made a safe offing and waited for the\r\nmorning; but this was no ordinary occasion; all about him were appealing\r\nfaces, faces pathetic with disappointment.  So his sympathy moved him to\r\ntry the dangerous passage in the dark.  He had entered the Heads\r\nseventeen times, and believed he knew the ground.  So he steered straight\r\nfor the false opening, mistaking it for the true one.  He did not find\r\nout that he was wrong until it was too late.  There was no saving the\r\nship.  The great seas swept her in and crushed her to splinters and\r\nrubbish upon the rock tushes at the base of the precipice.  Not one of\r\nall that fair and gracious company was ever seen again alive.  The tale\r\nis told to every stranger that passes the spot, and it will continue to\r\nbe told to all that come, for generations; but it will never grow old,\r\ncustom cannot stale it, the heart-break that is in it can never perish\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nThere were two hundred persons in the ship, and but one survived the\r\ndisaster.  He was a sailor.  A huge sea flung him up the face of the\r\nprecipice and stretched him on a narrow shelf of rock midway between the\r\ntop and the bottom, and there he lay all night.  At any other time he\r\nwould have lain there for the rest of his life, without chance of\r\ndiscovery; but the next morning the ghastly news swept through Sydney\r\nthat the Duncan Dunbar had gone down in sight of home, and straightway\r\nthe walls of the Heads were black with mourners; and one of these,\r\nstretching himself out over the precipice to spy out what might be seen\r\nbelow, discovered this miraculously preserved relic of the wreck.  Ropes\r\nwere brought and the nearly impossible feat of rescuing the man was\r\naccomplished.  He was a person with a practical turn of mind, and he\r\nhired a hall in Sydney and exhibited himself at sixpence a head till he\r\nexhausted the output of the gold fields for that year.\r\n\r\nWe entered and cast anchor, and in the morning went oh-ing and ah-ing in\r\nadmiration up through the crooks and turns of the spacious and beautiful\r\nharbor--a harbor which is the darling of Sydney and the wonder of the\r\nworld.  It is not surprising that the people are proud of it, nor that\r\nthey put their enthusiasm into eloquent words.  A returning citizen asked\r\nme what I thought of it, and I testified with a cordiality which I judged\r\nwould be up to the market rate.  I said it was beautiful--superbly\r\nbeautiful.  Then by a natural impulse I gave God the praise.  The citizen\r\ndid not seem altogether satisfied.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is beautiful, of course it's beautiful--the Harbor; but that isn't\r\nall of it, it's only half of it; Sydney's the other half, and it takes\r\nboth of them together to ring the supremacy-bell.  God made the Harbor,\r\nand that's all right; but Satan made Sydney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I made an apology; and asked him to convey it to his friend.\r\nHe was right about Sydney being half of it.  It would be beautiful\r\nwithout Sydney, but not above half as beautiful as it is now, with Sydney\r\nadded.  It is shaped somewhat like an oak-leaf--a roomy sheet of lovely\r\nblue water, with narrow off-shoots of water running up into the country\r\non both sides between long fingers of land, high wooden ridges with sides\r\nsloped like graves.  Handsome villas are perched here and there on these\r\nridges, snuggling amongst the foliage, and one catches alluring glimpses\r\nof them as the ship swims by toward the city.  The city clothes a cluster\r\nof hills and a ruffle of neighboring ridges with its undulating masses of\r\nmasonry, and out of these masses spring towers and spires and other\r\narchitectural dignities and grandeurs that break the flowing lines and\r\ngive picturesqueness to the general effect.\r\n\r\nThe narrow inlets which I have mentioned go wandering out into the land\r\neverywhere and hiding themselves in it, and pleasure-launches are always\r\nexploring them with picnic parties on board.  It is said by trustworthy\r\npeople that if you explore them all you will find that you have covered\r\n700 miles of water passage.  But there are liars everywhere this year,\r\nand they will double that when their works are in good going order.\r\nOctober was close at hand, spring was come.  It was really spring\r\n--everybody said so; but you could have sold it for summer in Canada, and\r\nnobody would have suspected.  It was the very weather that makes our home\r\nsummers the perfection of climatic luxury; I mean, when you are out in\r\nthe wood or by the sea.  But these people said it was cool, now--a person\r\nought to see Sydney in the summer time if he wanted to know what warm\r\nweather is; and he ought to go north ten or fifteen hundred miles if he\r\nwanted to know what hot weather is.  They said that away up there toward\r\nthe equator the hens laid fried eggs.  Sydney is the place to go to get\r\ninformation about other people's climates.  It seems to me that the\r\noccupation of Unbiased Traveler Seeking Information is the pleasantest\r\nand most irresponsible trade there is.  The traveler can always find out\r\nanything he wants to, merely by asking.  He can get at all the facts, and\r\nmore.  Everybody helps him, nobody hinders him.  Anybody who has an old\r\nfact in stock that is no longer negotiable in the domestic market will\r\nlet him have it at his own price.  An accumulation of such goods is\r\neasily and quickly made.  They cost almost nothing and they bring par in\r\nthe foreign market.  Travelers who come to America always freight up with\r\nthe same old nursery tales that their predecessors selected, and they\r\ncarry them back and always work them off without any trouble in the home\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nIf the climates of the world were determined by parallels of latitude,\r\nthen we could know a place's climate by its position on the map; and so\r\nwe should know that the climate of Sydney was the counterpart of the\r\nclimate of Columbia, S. C., and of Little Rock, Arkansas, since Sydney is\r\nabout the same distance south of the equator that those other towns are\r\nnorth of-it--thirty-four degrees.  But no, climate disregards the\r\nparallels of latitude.  In Arkansas they have a winter; in Sydney they\r\nhave the name of it, but not the thing itself.  I have seen the ice in\r\nthe Mississippi floating past the mouth of the Arkansas river; and at\r\nMemphis, but a little way above, the Mississippi has been frozen over,\r\nfrom bank to bank.  But they have never had a cold spell in Sydney which\r\nbrought the mercury down to freezing point.  Once in a mid-winter day\r\nthere, in the month of July, the mercury went down to 36 deg., and that\r\nremains the memorable \xe2\x80\x9ccold day\xe2\x80\x9d in the history of the town.  No doubt\r\nLittle Rock has seen it below zero.  Once, in Sydney, in mid-summer,\r\nabout New Year's Day, the mercury went up to 106 deg. in the shade, and\r\nthat is Sydney's memorable hot day.  That would about tally with Little\r\nRock's hottest day also, I imagine.  My Sydney figures are taken from a\r\ngovernment report, and are trustworthy.  In the matter of summer weather\r\nArkansas has no advantage over Sydney, perhaps, but when it comes to\r\nwinter weather, that is another affair.  You could cut up an Arkansas\r\nwinter into a hundred Sydney winters and have enough left for Arkansas\r\nand the poor.\r\n\r\nThe whole narrow, hilly belt of the Pacific side of New South Wales has\r\nthe climate of its capital--a mean winter temperature of 54 deg. and a\r\nmean summer one of 71 deg.  It is a climate which cannot be improved upon\r\nfor healthfulness.  But the experts say that 90 deg. in New South Wales\r\nis harder to bear than 112 deg. in the neighboring colony of Victoria,\r\nbecause the atmosphere of the former is humid, and of the latter dry.\r\nThe mean temperature of the southernmost point of New South Wales is the\r\nsame as that of Nice--60 deg.--yet Nice is further from the equator by\r\n460 miles than is the former.\r\n\r\nBut Nature is always stingy of perfect climates; stingier in the case of\r\nAustralia than usual.  Apparently this vast continent has a really good\r\nclimate nowhere but around the edges.\r\n\r\nIf we look at a map of the world we are surprised to see how big\r\nAustralia is.  It is about two-thirds as large as the United States was\r\nbefore we added Alaska.\r\n\r\nBut where as one finds a sufficiently good climate and fertile land\r\nalmost everywhere in the United States, it seems settled that inside of\r\nthe Australian border-belt one finds many deserts and in spots a climate\r\nwhich nothing can stand except a few of the hardier kinds of rocks.  In\r\neffect, Australia is as yet unoccupied.  If you take a map of the United\r\nStates and leave the Atlantic sea-board States in their places; also the\r\nfringe of Southern States from Florida west to the Mouth of the\r\nMississippi; also a narrow, inhabited streak up the Mississippi half-way\r\nto its head waters; also a narrow, inhabited border along the Pacific\r\ncoast: then take a brushful of paint and obliterate the whole remaining\r\nmighty stretch of country that lies between the Atlantic States and the\r\nPacific-coast strip, your map will look like the latest map of Australia.\r\n\r\nThis stupendous blank is hot, not to say torrid; a part of it is fertile,\r\nthe rest is desert; it is not liberally watered; it has no towns.  One\r\nhas only to cross the mountains of New South Wales and descend into the\r\nwestward-lying regions to find that he has left the choice climate behind\r\nhim, and found a new one of a quite different character.  In fact, he\r\nwould not know by the thermometer that he was not in the blistering\r\nPlains of India.  Captain Sturt, the great explorer, gives us a sample of\r\nthe heat.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe wind, which had been blowing all the morning from the N.E.,\r\n     increased to a heavy gale, and I shall never forget its withering\r\n     effect.  I sought shelter behind a large gum-tree, but the blasts of\r\n     heat were so terrific that I wondered the very grass did not take\r\n     fire.  This really was nothing ideal: everything both animate and\r\n     inanimate gave way before it; the horses stood with their backs to\r\n     the wind and their noses to the ground, without the muscular\r\n     strength to raise their heads; the birds were mute, and the leaves\r\n     of the trees under which we were sitting fell like a snow shower\r\n     around us.  At noon I took a thermometer graded to 127 deg., out of\r\n     my box, and observed that the mercury was up to 125.  Thinking that\r\n     it had been unduly influenced, I put it in the fork of a tree close\r\n     to me, sheltered alike from the wind and the sun.  I went to examine\r\n     it about an hour afterwards, when I found the mercury had risen to\r\n     the-top of the instrument and had burst the bulb, a circumstance\r\n     that I believe no traveler has ever before had to record.  I cannot\r\n     find language to convey to the reader's mind an idea of the intense\r\n     and oppressive nature of the heat that prevailed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat hot wind sweeps over Sydney sometimes, and brings with it what is\r\ncalled a \xe2\x80\x9cdust-storm.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is said that most Australian towns are\r\nacquainted with the dust-storm.  I think I know what it is like, for the\r\nfollowing description by Mr. Gane tallies very well with the alkali\r\nduststorm of Nevada, if you leave out the \xe2\x80\x9cshovel\xe2\x80\x9d part.  Still the\r\nshovel part is a pretty important part, and seems to indicate that my\r\nNevada storm is but a poor thing, after all.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAs we proceeded the altitude became less, and the heat\r\n     proportionately greater until we reached Dubbo, which is only 600\r\n     feet above sea-level.  It is a pretty town, built on an extensive\r\n     plain .  .  .  .  After the effects of a shower of rain have passed\r\n     away the surface of the ground crumbles into a thick layer of dust,\r\n     and occasionally, when the wind is in a particular quarter, it is\r\n     lifted bodily from the ground in one long opaque cloud.  In the\r\n     midst of such a storm nothing can be seen a few yards ahead, and the\r\n     unlucky person who happens to be out at the time is compelled to\r\n     seek the nearest retreat at hand.  When the thrifty housewife sees\r\n     in the distance the dark column advancing in a steady whirl towards\r\n     her house, she closes the doors and windows with all expedition.  A\r\n     drawing-room, the window of which has been carelessly left open\r\n     during a dust-storm, is indeed an extraordinary sight.  A lady who\r\n     has resided in Dubbo for some years says that the dust lies so thick\r\n     on the carpet that it is necessary to use a shovel to remove it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd probably a wagon.  I was mistaken; I have not seen a proper\r\nduststorm.  To my mind the exterior aspects and character of Australia\r\nare fascinating things to look at and think about, they are so strange,\r\nso weird, so new, so uncommonplace, such a startling and interesting\r\ncontrast to the other sections of the planet, the sections that are known\r\nto us all, familiar to us all.  In the matter of particulars--a detail\r\nhere, a detail there--we have had the choice climate of New South Wales'\r\nseacoast; we have had the Australian heat as furnished by Captain Sturt;\r\nwe have had the wonderful dust-storm; and we have considered the\r\nphenomenon of an almost empty hot wilderness half as big as the United\r\nStates, with a narrow belt of civilization, population, and good climate\r\naround it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nEverything human is pathetic.  The secret source of Humor itself is not\r\njoy but sorrow.  There is no humor in heaven.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cook found Australia in 1770, and eighteen years later the\r\nBritish Government began to transport convicts to it.  Altogether, New\r\nSouth Wales received 83,000 in 53 years.  The convicts wore heavy chains;\r\nthey were ill-fed and badly treated by the officers set over them; they\r\nwere heavily punished for even slight infractions of the rules; \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\ncruelest discipline ever known\xe2\x80\x9d is one historian's description of their\r\nlife.--[The Story of Australasia.  J. S. Laurie.]\r\n\r\nEnglish law was hard-hearted in those days.  For trifling offenses which\r\nin our day would be punished by a small fine or a few days' confinement,\r\nmen, women, and boys were sent to this other end of the earth to serve\r\nterms of seven and fourteen years; and for serious crimes they were\r\ntransported for life.  Children were sent to the penal colonies for seven\r\nyears for stealing a rabbit!\r\n\r\nWhen I was in London twenty-three years ago there was a new penalty in\r\nforce for diminishing garroting and wife-beating--25 lashes on the bare\r\nback with the cat-o'-nine-tails.  It was said that this terrible\r\npunishment was able to bring the stubbornest ruffians to terms; and that\r\nno man had been found with grit enough to keep his emotions to himself\r\nbeyond the ninth blow; as a rule the man shrieked earlier.  That penalty\r\nhad a great and wholesome effect upon the garroters and wife-beaters; but\r\nhumane modern London could not endure it; it got its law rescinded.  Many\r\na bruised and battered English wife has since had occasion to deplore\r\nthat cruel achievement of sentimental \xe2\x80\x9chumanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTwenty-five lashes!  In Australia and Tasmania they gave a convict fifty\r\nfor almost any little offense; and sometimes a brutal officer would add\r\nfifty, and then another fifty, and so on, as long as the sufferer could\r\nendure the torture and live.  In Tasmania I read the entry, in an old\r\nmanuscript official record, of a case where a convict was given three\r\nhundred lashes--for stealing some silver spoons.  And men got more than\r\nthat, sometimes.  Who handled the cat?  Often it was another convict;\r\nsometimes it was the culprit's dearest comrade; and he had to lay on with\r\nall his might; otherwise he would get a flogging himself for his mercy\r\n--for he was under watch--and yet not do his friend any good: the friend\r\nwould be attended to by another hand and suffer no lack in the matter of\r\nfull punishment.\r\n\r\nThe convict life in Tasmania was so unendurable, and suicide so difficult\r\nto accomplish that once or twice despairing men got together and drew\r\nstraws to determine which of them should kill another of the group--this\r\nmurder to secure death to the perpetrator and to the witnesses of it by\r\nthe hand of the hangman!\r\n\r\nThe incidents quoted above are mere hints, mere suggestions of what\r\nconvict life was like--they are but a couple of details tossed into view\r\nout of a shoreless sea of such; or, to change the figure, they are but a\r\npair of flaming steeples photographed from a point which hides from sight\r\nthe burning city which stretches away from their bases on every hand.\r\n\r\nSome of the convicts--indeed, a good many of them--were very bad people,\r\neven for that day; but the most of them were probably not noticeably\r\nworse than the average of the people they left behind them at home.  We\r\nmust believe this; we cannot avoid it.  We are obliged to believe that a\r\nnation that could look on, unmoved, and see starving or freezing women\r\nhanged for stealing twenty-six cents' worth of bacon or rags, and boys\r\nsnatched from their mothers, and men from their families, and sent to the\r\nother side of the world for long terms of years for similar trifling\r\noffenses, was a nation to whom the term \xe2\x80\x9ccivilized\xe2\x80\x9d could not in any\r\nlarge way be applied.  And we must also believe that a nation that knew,\r\nduring more than forty years, what was happening to those exiles and was\r\nstill content with it, was not advancing in any showy way toward a higher\r\ngrade of civilization.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the characters and conduct of the officers and gentlemen\r\nwho had charge of the convicts and attended to their backs and stomachs,\r\nwe must grant again that as between the convict and his masters, and\r\nbetween both and the nation at home, there was a quite noticeable\r\nmonotony of sameness.\r\n\r\nFour years had gone by, and many convicts had come.  Respectable settlers\r\nwere beginning to arrive.  These two classes of colonists had to be\r\nprotected, in case of trouble among themselves or with the natives.  It\r\nis proper to mention the natives, though they could hardly count they\r\nwere so scarce.  At a time when they had not as yet begun to be much\r\ndisturbed--not as yet being in the way--it was estimated that in New\r\nSouth Wales there was but one native to 45,000 acres of territory.\r\n\r\nPeople had to be protected.  Officers of the regular army did not want\r\nthis service--away off there where neither honor nor distinction was to\r\nbe gained.  So England recruited and officered a kind of militia force of\r\n1,000 uniformed civilians called the \xe2\x80\x9cNew South Wales Corps\xe2\x80\x9d and shipped\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis was the worst blow of all.  The colony fairly staggered under it.\r\nThe Corps was an object-lesson of the moral condition of England outside\r\nof the jails.  The colonists trembled.  It was feared that next there\r\nwould be an importation of the nobility.\r\n\r\nIn those early days the colony was non-supporting.  All the necessaries\r\nof life--food, clothing, and all--were sent out from England, and kept in\r\ngreat government store-houses, and given to the convicts and sold to the\r\nsettlers--sold at a trifling advance upon cost.  The Corps saw its\r\nopportunity.  Its officers went into commerce, and in a most lawless way.\r\nThey went to importing rum, and also to manufacturing it in private\r\nstills, in defiance of the government's commands and protests.  They\r\nleagued themselves together and ruled the market; they boycotted the\r\ngovernment and the other dealers; they established a close monopoly and\r\nkept it strictly in their own hands.  When a vessel arrived with spirits,\r\nthey allowed nobody to buy but themselves, and they forced the owner to\r\nsell to them at a price named by themselves--and it was always low\r\nenough.  They bought rum at an average of two dollars a gallon and sold\r\nit at an average of ten.  They made rum the currency of the country--for\r\nthere was little or no money--and they maintained their devastating hold\r\nand kept the colony under their heel for eighteen or twenty years before\r\nthey were finally conquered and routed by the government.\r\n\r\nMeantime, they had spread intemperance everywhere.  And they had squeezed\r\nfarm after farm out of the settlers hands for rum, and thus had\r\nbountifully enriched themselves.  When a farmer was caught in the last\r\nagonies of thirst they took advantage of him and sweated him for a drink.\r\nIn one instance they sold a man a gallon of rum worth two dollars for a\r\npiece of property which was sold some years later for $100,000.\r\nWhen the colony was about eighteen or twenty years old it was discovered\r\nthat the land was specially fitted for the wool-culture.  Prosperity\r\nfollowed, commerce with the world began, by and by rich mines of the\r\nnoble metals were opened, immigrants flowed in, capital likewise.  The\r\nresult is the great and wealthy and enlightened commonwealth of New South\r\nWales.\r\n\r\nIt is a country that is rich in mines, wool ranches, trams, railways,\r\nsteamship lines, schools, newspapers, botanical gardens, art galleries,\r\nlibraries, museums, hospitals, learned societies; it is the hospitable\r\nhome of every species of culture and of every species of material\r\nenterprise, and there is a church at every man's door, and a race-track\r\nover the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWe should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is\r\nin it--and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot\r\nstove-lid.  She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again--and that is\r\nwell; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nAll English-speaking colonies are made up of lavishly hospitable people,\r\nand New South Wales and its capital are like the rest in this.  The\r\nEnglish-speaking colony of the United States of America is always\r\ncalled lavishly hospitable by the English traveler.  As to the other\r\nEnglish-speaking colonies throughout the world from Canada all around, I\r\nknow by experience that the description fits them.  I will not go more\r\nparticularly into this matter, for I find that when writers try to\r\ndistribute their gratitude here and there and yonder by detail they run\r\nacross difficulties and do some ungraceful stumbling.\r\n\r\nMr. Gane (\xe2\x80\x9cNew South Wales and Victoria in 1885 \xe2\x80\x9c), tried to distribute\r\nhis gratitude, and was not lucky:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe inhabitants of Sydney are renowned for their hospitality.  The\r\n     treatment which we experienced at the hands of this generous-hearted\r\n     people will help more than anything else to make us recollect with\r\n     pleasure our stay amongst them.  In the character of hosts and\r\n     hostesses they excel.  The 'new chum' needs only the\r\n     acquaintanceship of one of their number, and he becomes at once the\r\n     happy recipient of numerous complimentary invitations and thoughtful\r\n     kindnesses.  Of the towns it has been our good fortune to visit,\r\n     none have portrayed home so faithfully as Sydney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody could say it finer than that.  If he had put in his cork then, and\r\nstayed away from Dubbo----but no; heedless man, he pulled it again.\r\nPulled it when he was away along in his book, and his memory of what he\r\nhad said about Sydney had grown dim:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot quit the promising town of Dubbo without testifying, in\r\n     warm praise, to the kind-hearted and hospitable usages of its\r\n     inhabitants.  Sydney, though well deserving the character it bears\r\n     of its kindly treatment of strangers, possesses a little formality\r\n     and reserve.  In Dubbo, on the contrary, though the same congenial\r\n     manners prevail, there is a pleasing degree of respectful\r\n     familiarity which gives the town a homely comfort not often met with\r\n     elsewhere.  In laying on one side our pen we feel contented in\r\n     having been able, though so late in this work, to bestow a\r\n     panegyric, however unpretentious, on a town which, though possessing\r\n     no picturesque natural surroundings, nor interesting architectural\r\n     productions, has yet a body of citizens whose hearts cannot but\r\n     obtain for their town a reputation for benevolence and\r\n     kind-heartedness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wonder what soured him on Sydney.  It seems strange that a pleasing\r\ndegree of three or four fingers of respectful familiarity should fill a\r\nman up and give him the panegyrics so bad.  For he has them, the worst\r\nway--any one can see that.  A man who is perfectly at himself does not\r\nthrow cold detraction at people's architectural productions and\r\npicturesque surroundings, and let on that what he prefers is a Dubbonese\r\ndust-storm and a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity. No, these are\r\nold, old symptoms; and when they appear we know that the man has got the\r\npanegyrics.\r\n\r\nSydney has a population of 400,000.  When a stranger from America steps\r\nashore there, the first thing that strikes him is that the place is eight\r\nor nine times as large as he was expecting it to be; and the next thing\r\nthat strikes him is that it is an English city with American trimmings.\r\nLater on, in Melbourne, he will find the American trimmings still more in\r\nevidence; there, even the architecture will often suggest America; a\r\nphotograph of its stateliest business street might be passed upon him for\r\na picture of the finest street in a large American city.  I was told that\r\nthe most of the fine residences were the city residences of squatters.\r\nThe name seemed out of focus somehow.  When the explanation came, it\r\noffered a new instance of the curious changes which words, as well as\r\nanimals, undergo through change of habitat and climate.  With us, when\r\nyou speak of a squatter you are always supposed to be speaking of a poor\r\nman, but in Australia when you speak of a squatter you are supposed to be\r\nspeaking of a millionaire; in America the word indicates the possessor of\r\na few acres and a doubtful title, in Australia it indicates a man whose\r\nlandfront is as long as a railroad, and whose title has been perfected in\r\none way or another; in America the word indicates a man who owns a dozen\r\nhead of live stock, in Australia a man who owns anywhere from fifty\r\nthousand up to half a million head; in America the word indicates a man\r\nwho is obscure and not important, in Australia a man who is prominent and\r\nof the first importance; in America you take off your hat to no squatter,\r\nin Australia you do; in America if your uncle is a squatter you keep it\r\ndark, in Australia you advertise it; in America if your friend is a\r\nsquatter nothing comes of it, but with a squatter for your friend in\r\nAustralia you may sup with kings if there are any around.\r\n\r\nIn Australia it takes about two acres and a half of pastureland (some\r\npeople say twice as many), to support a sheep; and when the squatter has\r\nhalf a million sheep his private domain is about as large as Rhode\r\nIsland, to speak in general terms.  His annual wool crop may be worth a\r\nquarter or a half million dollars.\r\n\r\nHe will live in a palace in Melbourne or Sydney or some other of the\r\nlarge cities, and make occasional trips to his sheep-kingdom several\r\nhundred miles away in the great plains to look after his battalions of\r\nriders and shepherds and other hands.  He has a commodious dwelling out\r\nthere, and if he approve of you he will invite you to spend a week in it,\r\nand will make you at home and comfortable, and let you see the great\r\nindustry in all its details, and feed you and slake you and smoke you\r\nwith the best that money can buy.\r\n\r\nOn at least one of these vast estates there is a considerable town, with\r\nall the various businesses and occupations that go to make an important\r\ntown; and the town and the land it stands upon are the property of the\r\nsquatters.  I have seen that town, and it is not unlikely that there are\r\nother squatter-owned towns in Australia.\r\n\r\nAustralia supplies the world not only with fine wool, but with mutton\r\nalso.  The modern invention of cold storage and its application in ships\r\nhas created this great trade.  In Sydney I visited a huge establishment\r\nwhere they kill and clean and solidly freeze a thousand sheep a day, for\r\nshipment to England.\r\n\r\nThe Australians did not seem to me to differ noticeably from Americans,\r\neither in dress, carriage, ways, pronunciation, inflections, or general\r\nappearance.  There were fleeting and subtle suggestions of their English\r\norigin, but these were not pronounced enough, as a rule, to catch one's\r\nattention.  The people have easy and cordial manners from the beginning\r\n--from the moment that the introduction is completed.  This is American.\r\nTo put it in another way, it is English friendliness with the English\r\nshyness and self-consciousness left out.\r\n\r\nNow and then--but this is rare--one hears such words as piper for paper,\r\nlydy for lady, and tyble for table fall from lips whence one would not\r\nexpect such pronunciations to come.  There is a superstition prevalent in\r\nSydney that this pronunciation is an Australianism, but people who have\r\nbeen \xe2\x80\x9chome\xe2\x80\x9d--as the native reverently and lovingly calls England--know\r\nbetter.  It is \xe2\x80\x9ccostermonger.\xe2\x80\x9d  All over Australasia this pronunciation\r\nis nearly as common among servants as it is in London among the\r\nuneducated and the partially educated of all sorts and conditions of\r\npeople.  That mislaid 'y' is rather striking when a person gets enough of\r\nit into a short sentence to enable it to show up.  In the hotel in Sydney\r\nthe chambermaid said, one morning:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe tyble is set, and here is the piper; and if the lydy is ready I'll\r\ntell the wyter to bring up the breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have made passing mention, a moment ago, of the native Australasian's\r\ncustom of speaking of England as \xe2\x80\x9chome.\xe2\x80\x9d  It was always pretty to hear\r\nit, and often it was said in an unconsciously caressing way that made it\r\ntouching; in a way which transmuted a sentiment into an embodiment, and\r\nmade one seem to see Australasia as a young girl stroking mother\r\nEngland's old gray head.\r\n\r\nIn the Australasian home the table-talk is vivacious and unembarrassed;\r\nit is without stiffness or restraint.  This does not remind one of\r\nEngland so much as it does of America.  But Australasia is strictly\r\ndemocratic, and reserves and restraints are things that are bred by\r\ndifferences of rank.\r\n\r\nEnglish and colonial audiences are phenomenally alert and responsive.\r\nWhere masses of people are gathered together in England, caste is\r\nsubmerged, and with it the English reserve; equality exists for the\r\nmoment, and every individual is free; so free from any consciousness of\r\nfetters, indeed, that the Englishman's habit of watching himself and\r\nguarding himself against any injudicious exposure of his feelings is\r\nforgotten, and falls into abeyance--and to such a degree indeed, that he\r\nwill bravely applaud all by himself if he wants to--an exhibition of\r\ndaring which is unusual elsewhere in the world.\r\n\r\nBut it is hard to move a new English acquaintance when he is by himself,\r\nor when the company present is small and new to him.  He is on his guard\r\nthen, and his natural reserve is to the fore.  This has given him the\r\nfalse reputation of being without humor and without the appreciation of\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\nAmericans are not Englishmen, and American humor is not English humor;\r\nbut both the American and his humor had their origin in England, and have\r\nmerely undergone changes brought about by changed conditions and a new\r\nenvironment.  About the best humorous speeches I have yet heard were a\r\ncouple that were made in Australia at club suppers--one of them by an\r\nEnglishman, the other by an Australian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nThere are those who scoff at the schoolboy, calling him frivolous and\r\nshallow: Yet it was the schoolboy who said \xe2\x80\x9cFaith is believing what you\r\nknow ain't so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                   --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nIn Sydney I had a large dream, and in the course of talk I told it to a\r\nmissionary from India who was on his way to visit some relatives in New\r\nZealand.  I dreamed that the visible universe is the physical person of\r\nGod; that the vast worlds that we see twinkling millions of miles apart\r\nin the fields of space are the blood corpuscles in His veins; and that we\r\nand the other creatures are the microbes that charge with multitudinous\r\nlife the corpuscles.\r\n\r\nMr. X., the missionary, considered the dream awhile, then said:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not surpassable for magnitude, since its metes and bounds are\r\n     the metes and bounds of the universe itself; and it seems to me that\r\n     it almost accounts for a thing which is otherwise nearly\r\n     unaccountable--the origin of the sacred legends of the Hindoos.\r\n     Perhaps they dream them, and then honestly believe them to be divine\r\n     revelations of fact.  It looks like that, for the legends are built\r\n     on so vast a scale that it does not seem reasonable that plodding\r\n     priests would happen upon such colossal fancies when awake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe told some of the legends, and said that they were implicitly believed\r\nby all classes of Hindoos, including those of high social position and\r\nintelligence; and he said that this universal credulity was a great\r\nhindrance to the missionary in his work.  Then he said something like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt home, people wonder why Christianity does not make faster\r\n     progress in India.  They hear that the Indians believe easily, and\r\n     that they have a natural trust in miracles and give them a\r\n     hospitable reception.  Then they argue like this: since the Indian\r\n     believes easily, place Christianity before them and they must\r\n     believe; confirm its truths by the biblical miracles, and they will\r\n     no longer doubt. The natural deduction is, that as Christianity\r\n     makes but indifferent progress in India, the fault is with us: we\r\n     are not fortunate in presenting the doctrines and the miracles.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBut the truth is, we are not by any means so well equipped as they\r\n     think.  We have not the easy task that they imagine.  To use a\r\n     military figure, we are sent against the enemy with good powder in\r\n     our guns, but only wads for bullets; that is to say, our miracles\r\n     are not effective; the Hindoos do not care for them; they have more\r\n     extraordinary ones of their own.  All the details of their own\r\n     religion are proven and established by miracles; the details of ours\r\n     must be proven in the same way.  When I first began my work in India\r\n     I greatly underestimated the difficulties thus put upon my task.  A\r\n     correction was not long in coming.  I thought as our friends think\r\n     at home--that to prepare my childlike wonder-lovers to listen with\r\n     favor to my grave message I only needed to charm the way to it with\r\n     wonders, marvels, miracles.  With full confidence I told the wonders\r\n     performed by Samson, the strongest man that had ever lived--for so I\r\n     called him.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt first I saw lively anticipation and strong interest in the faces\r\n     of my people, but as I moved along from incident to incident of the\r\n     great story, I was distressed to see that I was steadily losing the\r\n     sympathy of my audience.  I could not understand it.  It was a\r\n     surprise to me, and a disappointment.  Before I was through, the\r\n     fading sympathy had paled to indifference.  Thence to the end the\r\n     indifference remained; I was not able to make any impression upon\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA good old Hindoo gentleman told me where my trouble lay.  He said\r\n     'We Hindoos recognize a god by the work of his hands--we accept no\r\n     other testimony.  Apparently, this is also the rule with you\r\n     Christians.  And we know when a man has his power from a god by the\r\n     fact that he does things which he could not do, as a man, with the\r\n     mere powers of a man.  Plainly, this is the Christian's way also, of\r\n     knowing when a man is working by a god's power and not by his own.\r\n     You saw that there was a supernatural property in the hair of\r\n     Samson; for you perceived that when his hair was gone he was as\r\n     other men.  It is our way, as I have said.  There are many nations\r\n     in the world, and each group of nations has its own gods, and will\r\n     pay no worship to the gods of the others.  Each group believes its\r\n     own gods to be strongest, and it will not exchange them except for\r\n     gods that shall be proven to be their superiors in power.  Man is\r\n     but a weak creature, and needs the help of gods--he cannot do\r\n     without it.  Shall he place his fate in the hands of weak gods when\r\n     there may be stronger ones to be found?  That would be foolish.  No,\r\n     if he hear of gods that are stronger than his own, he should not\r\n     turn a deaf ear, for it is not a light matter that is at stake.  How\r\n     then shall he determine which gods are the stronger, his own or\r\n     those that preside over the concerns of other nations?  By comparing\r\n     the known works of his own gods with the works of those others;\r\n     there is no other way.  Now, when we make this comparison, we are\r\n     not drawn towards the gods of any other nation.  Our gods are shown\r\n     by their works to be the strongest, the most powerful.  The\r\n     Christians have but few gods, and they are new--new, and not strong;\r\n     as it seems to us.  They will increase in number, it is true, for\r\n     this has happened with all gods, but that time is far away, many\r\n     ages and decades of ages away, for gods multiply slowly, as is meet\r\n     for beings to whom a thousand years is but a single moment.  Our own\r\n     gods have been born millions of years apart.  The process is slow,\r\n     the gathering of strength and power is similarly slow.  In the slow\r\n     lapse of the ages the steadily accumulating power of our gods has at\r\n     last become prodigious.  We have a thousand proofs of this in the\r\n     colossal character of their personal acts and the acts of ordinary\r\n     men to whom they have given supernatural qualities.  To your Samson\r\n     was given supernatural power, and when he broke the withes, and slew\r\n     the thousands with the jawbone of an ass, and carried away the\r\n     gate's of the city upon his shoulders, you were amazed--and also\r\n     awed, for you recognized the divine source of his strength.  But it\r\n     could not profit to place these things before your Hindoo\r\n     congregation and invite their wonder; for they would compare them\r\n     with the deed done by Hanuman, when our gods infused their divine\r\n     strength into his muscles; and they would be indifferent to them--as\r\n     you saw.  In the old, old times, ages and ages gone by, when our god\r\n     Rama was warring with the demon god of Ceylon, Rama bethought him to\r\n     bridge the sea and connect Ceylon with India, so that his armies\r\n     might pass easily over; and he sent his general, Hanuman, inspired\r\n     like your own Samson with divine strength, to bring the materials\r\n     for the bridge.  In two days Hanuman strode fifteen hundred miles,\r\n     to the Himalayas, and took upon his shoulder a range of those lofty\r\n     mountains two hundred miles long, and started with it toward Ceylon.\r\n     It was in the night; and, as he passed along the plain, the people\r\n     of Govardhun heard the thunder of his tread and felt the earth\r\n     rocking under it, and they ran out, and there, with their snowy\r\n     summits piled to heaven, they saw the Himalayas passing by.  And as\r\n     this huge continent swept along overshadowing the earth, upon its\r\n     slopes they discerned the twinkling lights of a thousand sleeping\r\n     villages, and it was as if the constellations were filing in\r\n     procession through the sky.  While they were looking, Hanuman\r\n     stumbled, and a small ridge of red sandstone twenty miles long was\r\n     jolted loose and fell.  Half of its length has wasted away in the\r\n     course of the ages, but the other ten miles of it remain in the\r\n     plain by Govardhun to this day as proof of the might of the\r\n     inspiration of our gods.  You must know, yourself, that Hanuman\r\n     could not have carried those mountains to Ceylon except by the\r\n     strength of the gods.  You know that it was not done by his own\r\n     strength, therefore, you know that it was done by the strength of\r\n     the gods, just as you know that Samson carried the gates by the\r\n     divine strength and not by his own.  I think you must concede two\r\n     things:  First, That in carrying the gates of the city upon his\r\n     shoulders, Samson did not establish the superiority of his gods over\r\n     ours; secondly, That his feat is not supported by any but verbal\r\n     evidence, while Hanuman's is not only supported by verbal evidence,\r\n     but this evidence is confirmed, established, proven, by visible,\r\n     tangible evidence, which is the strongest of all testimony.  We have\r\n     the sandstone ridge, and while it remains we cannot doubt, and shall\r\n     not.  Have you the gates?'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nThe timid man yearns for full value and asks a tenth.  The bold man\r\nstrikes for double value and compromises on par.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOne is sure to be struck by the liberal way in which Australasia spends\r\nmoney upon public works--such as legislative buildings, town halls,\r\nhospitals, asylums, parks, and botanical gardens.  I should say that\r\nwhere minor towns in America spend a hundred dollars on the town hall and\r\non public parks and gardens, the like towns in Australasia spend a\r\nthousand.  And I think that this ratio will hold good in the matter of\r\nhospitals, also.  I have seen a costly and well-equipped, and\r\narchitecturally handsome hospital in an Australian village of fifteen\r\nhundred inhabitants.  It was built by private funds furnished by the\r\nvillagers and the neighboring planters, and its running expenses were\r\ndrawn from the same sources.  I suppose it would be hard to match this in\r\nany country.  This village was about to close a contract for lighting its\r\nstreets with the electric light, when I was there.  That is ahead of\r\nLondon.  London is still obscured by gas--gas pretty widely scattered,\r\ntoo, in some of the districts; so widely indeed, that except on moonlight\r\nnights it is difficult to find the gas lamps.\r\n\r\nThe botanical garden of Sydney covers thirty-eight acres, beautifully\r\nlaid out and rich with the spoil of all the lands and all the climes of\r\nthe world.  The garden is on high ground in the middle of the town,\r\noverlooking the great harbor, and it adjoins the spacious grounds of\r\nGovernment House--fifty-six acres; and at hand also, is a recreation\r\nground containing eighty-two acres.  In addition, there are the\r\nzoological gardens, the race-course, and the great cricket-grounds where\r\nthe international matches are played.  Therefore there is plenty of room\r\nfor reposeful lazying and lounging, and for exercise too, for such as\r\nlike that kind of work.\r\n\r\nThere are four specialties attainable in the way of social pleasure.  If\r\nyou enter your name on the Visitor's Book at Government House you will\r\nreceive an invitation to the next ball that takes place there, if nothing\r\ncan be proven against you.  And it will be very pleasant; for you will\r\nsee everybody except the Governor, and add a number of acquaintances and\r\nseveral friends to your list.  The Governor will be in England.  He\r\nalways is.  The continent has four or five governors, and I do not know\r\nhow many it takes to govern the outlying archipelago; but anyway you will\r\nnot see them.  When they are appointed they come out from England and get\r\ninaugurated, and give a ball, and help pray for rain, and get aboard ship\r\nand go back home.  And so the Lieutenant-Governor has to do all the work.\r\nI was in Australasia three months and a half, and saw only one Governor.\r\nThe others were at home.\r\n\r\nThe Australasian Governor would not be so restless, perhaps, if he had a\r\nwar, or a veto, or something like that to call for his reserve-energies,\r\nbut he hasn't.  There isn't any war, and there isn't any veto in his\r\nhands.  And so there is really little or nothing doing in his line.  The\r\ncountry governs itself, and prefers to do it; and is so strenuous about\r\nit and so jealous of its independence that it grows restive if even the\r\nImperial Government at home proposes to help; and so the Imperial veto,\r\nwhile a fact, is yet mainly a name.\r\n\r\nThus the Governor's functions are much more limited than are a Governor's\r\nfunctions with us.  And therefore more fatiguing.  He is the apparent\r\nhead of the State, he is the real head of Society.  He represents\r\nculture, refinement, elevated sentiment, polite life, religion; and by\r\nhis example he propagates these, and they spread and flourish and bear\r\ngood fruit.  He creates the fashion, and leads it.  His ball is the ball\r\nof balls, and his countenance makes the horse-race thrive.\r\n\r\nHe is usually a lord, and this is well; for his position compels him to\r\nlead an expensive life, and an English lord is generally well equipped\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\nAnother of Sydney's social pleasures is the visit to the Admiralty House;\r\nwhich is nobly situated on high ground overlooking the water.  The trim\r\nboats of the service convey the guests thither; and there, or on board\r\nthe flag-ship, they have the duplicate of the hospitalities of Government\r\nHouse.  The Admiral commanding a station in British waters is a magnate\r\nof the first degree, and he is sumptuously housed, as becomes the dignity\r\nof his office.\r\n\r\nThird in the list of special pleasures is the tour of the harbor in a\r\nfine steam pleasure-launch.  Your richer friends own boats of this kind,\r\nand they will invite you, and the joys of the trip will make a long day\r\nseem short.\r\n\r\nAnd finally comes the shark-fishing.  Sydney Harbor is populous with the\r\nfinest breeds of man-eating sharks in the world.  Some people make their\r\nliving catching them; for the Government pays a cash bounty on them.  The\r\nlarger the shark the larger the bounty, and some of the sharks are twenty\r\nfeet long.  You not only get the bounty, but everything that is in the\r\nshark belongs to you.  Sometimes the contents are quite valuable.\r\n\r\nThe shark is the swiftest fish that swims.  The speed of the fastest\r\nsteamer afloat is poor compared to his.  And he is a great gad-about, and\r\nroams far and wide in the oceans, and visits the shores of all of them,\r\nultimately, in the course of his restless excursions.  I have a tale to\r\ntell now, which has not as yet been in print.  In 1870 a young stranger\r\narrived in Sydney, and set about finding something to do; but he knew no\r\none, and brought no recommendations, and the result was that he got no\r\nemployment.  He had aimed high, at first, but as time and his money\r\nwasted away he grew less and less exacting, until at last he was willing\r\nto serve in the humblest capacities if so he might get bread and shelter.\r\nBut luck was still against him; he could find no opening of any sort.\r\nFinally his money was all gone.  He walked the streets all day, thinking;\r\nhe walked them all night, thinking, thinking, and growing hungrier and\r\nhungrier.  At dawn he found himself well away from the town and drifting\r\naimlessly along the harbor shore.  As he was passing by a nodding\r\nshark-fisher the man looked up and said----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, young fellow, take my line a spell, and change my luck for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know I won't make it worse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you can't.  It has been at its worst all night.  If you can't\r\nchange it, no harm's done; if you do change it, it's for the better,\r\nof course.  Come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, what will you give?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll give you the shark, if you catch one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I will eat it, bones and all.  Give me the line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere you are.  I will get away, now, for awhile, so that my luck won't\r\nspoil yours; for many and many a time I've noticed that if----there, pull\r\nin, pull in, man, you've got a bite!  I knew how it would be.  Why, I\r\nknew you for a born son of luck the minute I saw you.  All right--he's\r\nlanded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was an unusually large shark--\xe2\x80\x9ca full nineteen-footer,\xe2\x80\x9d the fisherman\r\nsaid, as he laid the creature open with his knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you rob him, young man, while I step to my hamper for a fresh bait.\r\nThere's generally something in them worth going for.  You've changed my\r\nluck, you see.  But my goodness, I hope you haven't changed your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it wouldn't matter; don't worry about that.  Get your bait.  I'll\r\nrob him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the fisherman got back the young man had just finished washing his\r\nhands in the bay, and was starting away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, you are not going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about your shark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shark?  Why, what use is he to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat use is he?  I like that.  Don't you know that we can go and report\r\nhim to Government, and you'll get a clean solid eighty shillings bounty?\r\nHard cash, you know.  What do you think about it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, well, you can collect it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd keep it?  Is that what you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, this is odd.  You're one of those sort they call eccentrics, I\r\njudge.  The saying is, you mustn't judge a man by his clothes, and I'm\r\nbelieving it now.  Why yours are looking just ratty, don't you know; and\r\nyet you must be rich.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man walked slowly back to the town, deeply musing as he went.\r\nHe halted a moment in front of the best restaurant, then glanced at his\r\nclothes and passed on, and got his breakfast at a \xe2\x80\x9cstand-up.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was\r\na good deal of it, and it cost five shillings.  He tendered a sovereign,\r\ngot his change, glanced at his silver, muttered to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThere isn't\r\nenough to buy clothes with,\xe2\x80\x9d and went his way.\r\n\r\nAt half-past nine the richest wool-broker in Sydney was sitting in his\r\nmorning-room at home, settling his breakfast with the morning paper.  A\r\nservant put his head in and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's a sundowner at the door wants to see you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you bring that kind of a message here for?  Send him about his\r\nbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't go, sir.  I've tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't go?  That's--why, that's unusual.  He's one of two things,\r\nthen: he's a remarkable person, or he's crazy.  Is he crazy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir.  He don't look it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he's remarkable.  What does he say he wants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won't tell, sir; only says it's very important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd won't go.  Does he say he won't go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays he'll stand there till he sees you, sir, if it's all day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet isn't crazy.  Show him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sundowner was shown in.  The broker said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he's not\r\ncrazy; that is easy to see; so he must be the other thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my good fellow, be quick about it; don't waste any\r\nwords; what is it you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to borrow a hundred thousand pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScott!  (It's a mistake; he is crazy .  .  .  .  No--he can't be--not\r\nwith that eye.) Why, you take my breath away.  Come, who are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody that you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCecil Rhodes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don't remember hearing the name before.  Now then--just for\r\ncuriosity's sake--what has sent you to me on this extraordinary errand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe intention to make a hundred thousand pounds for you and as much for\r\nmyself within the next sixty days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well.  It is the most extraordinary idea that--sit down--you\r\ninterest me.  And somehow you--well, you fascinate me; I think that that\r\nis about the word.  And it isn't your proposition--no, that doesn't\r\nfascinate me; it's something else, I don't quite know what; something\r\nthat's born in you and oozes out of you, I suppose.  Now then just for\r\ncuriosity's sake again, nothing more: as I understand it, it is your\r\ndesire to bor----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said intention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon, so you did.  I thought it was an unheedful use of the word--an\r\nunheedful valuing of its strength, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew its strength.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I must say--but look here, let me walk the floor a little, my mind\r\nis getting into a sort of whirl, though you don't seem disturbed any.\r\n(Plainly this young fellow isn't crazy; but as to his being remarkable\r\n--well, really he amounts to that, and something over.)  Now then, I\r\nbelieve I am beyond the reach of further astonishment.  Strike, and spare\r\nnot.  What is your scheme?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo buy the wool crop--deliverable in sixty days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, the whole of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I was not quite out of the reach of surprises, after all.  Why, how\r\nyou talk!  Do you know what our crop is going to foot up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo and a half million sterling--maybe a little more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you've got your statistics right, any way.  Now, then, do you know\r\nwhat the margins would foot up, to buy it at sixty days?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hundred thousand pounds I came here to get.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight, once more.  Well, dear me, just to see what would happen, I wish\r\nyou had the money.  And if you had it, what would you do with it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall make two hundred thousand pounds out of it in sixty days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean, of course, that you might make it if----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said 'shall'.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by George, you did say 'shall'!  You are the most definite devil I\r\never saw, in the matter of language.  Dear, dear, dear, look here!\r\nDefinite speech means clarity of mind.  Upon my word I believe you've got\r\nwhat you believe to be a rational reason, for venturing into this house,\r\nan entire stranger, on this wild scheme of buying the wool crop of an\r\nentire colony on speculation.  Bring it out--I am prepared--acclimatized,\r\nif I may use the word.  Why would you buy the crop, and why would you\r\nmake that sum out of it?  That is to say, what makes you think you----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't think--I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDefinite again.  How do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause France has declared war against Germany, and wool has gone up\r\nfourteen per cent. in London and is still rising.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, in-deed?  Now then, I've got you!  Such a thunderbolt as you have\r\njust let fly ought to have made me jump out of my chair, but it didn't\r\nstir me the least little bit, you see.  And for a very simple reason: I\r\nhave read the morning paper.  You can look at it if you want to.  The\r\nfastest ship in the service arrived at eleven o'clock last night, fifty\r\ndays out from London.  All her news is printed here.  There are no\r\nwar-clouds anywhere; and as for wool, why, it is the low-spiritedest\r\ncommodity in the English market.  It is your turn to jump, now .  .  .  .\r\nWell, why, don't you jump?  Why do you sit there in that placid fashion,\r\nwhen----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have later news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLater news?  Oh, come--later news than fifty days, brought steaming hot\r\nfrom London by the----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy news is only ten days old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mun-chausen, hear the maniac talk!  Where did you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGot it out of a shark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, oh, oh, this is too much!  Front! call the police bring the gun\r\n--raise the town!  All the asylums in Christendom have broken loose in\r\nthe\r\nsingle person of----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSit down!  And collect yourself.  Where is the use in getting excited?\r\nAm I excited?  There is nothing to get excited about.  When I make a\r\nstatement which I cannot prove, it will be time enough for you to begin\r\nto offer hospitality to damaging fancies about me and my sanity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, a thousand, thousand pardons!  I ought to be ashamed of myself, and\r\nI am ashamed of myself for thinking that a little bit of a circumstance\r\nlike sending a shark to England to fetch back a market report----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does your middle initial stand for, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAndrew.  What are you writing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment.  Proof about the shark--and another matter.  Only ten\r\nlines.  There--now it is done.  Sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany thanks--many.  Let me see; it says--it says oh, come, this is\r\ninteresting!  Why--why--look here! prove what you say here, and I'll put\r\nup the money, and double as much, if necessary, and divide the winnings\r\nwith you, half and half.  There, now--I've signed; make your promise good\r\nif you can.  Show me a copy of the London Times only ten days old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is--and with it these buttons and a memorandum book that\r\nbelonged to the man the shark swallowed.  Swallowed him in the Thames,\r\nwithout a doubt; for you will notice that the last entry in the book is\r\ndated 'London,' and is of the same date as the Times, and says, 'Ber\r\nconfequentz der Kreigeseflarun, reife ich heute nach Deutchland ab, aur\r\nbak ich mein leben auf dem Ultar meines Landes legen mag'----, as clean\r\nnative German as anybody can put upon paper, and means that in\r\nconsequence of the declaration of war, this loyal soul is leaving for\r\nhome to-day, to fight.  And he did leave, too, but the shark had him\r\nbefore the day was done, poor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a pity, too.  But there are times for mourning, and we will attend\r\nto this case further on; other matters are pressing, now.  I will go down\r\nand set the machinery in motion in a quiet way and buy the crop.  It will\r\ncheer the drooping spirits of the boys, in a transitory way.  Everything\r\nis transitory in this world.  Sixty days hence, when they are called to\r\ndeliver the goods, they will think they've been struck by lightning.  But\r\nthere is a time for mourning, and we will attend to that case along with\r\nthe other one.  Come along, I'll take you to my tailor.  What did you say\r\nyour name is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCecil Rhodes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hard to remember.  However, I think you will make it easier by and\r\nby, if you live.  There are three kinds of people--Commonplace Men,\r\nRemarkable Men, and Lunatics.  I'll classify you with the Remarkables,\r\nand take the chances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe deal went through, and secured to the young stranger the first\r\nfortune he ever pocketed.\r\n\r\nThe people of Sydney ought to be afraid of the sharks, but for some\r\nreason they do not seem to be.  On Saturdays the young men go out in\r\ntheir boats, and sometimes the water is fairly covered with the little\r\nsails.  A boat upsets now and then, by accident, a result of tumultuous\r\nskylarking; sometimes the boys upset their boat for fun--such as it is\r\nwith sharks visibly waiting around for just such an occurrence.  The\r\nyoung fellows scramble aboard whole--sometimes--not always.  Tragedies\r\nhave happened more than once.  While I was in Sydney it was reported that\r\na boy fell out of a boat in the mouth of the Paramatta river and screamed\r\nfor help and a boy jumped overboard from another boat to save him from\r\nthe assembling sharks; but the sharks made swift work with the lives of\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThe government pays a bounty for the shark; to get the bounty the\r\nfishermen bait the hook or the seine with agreeable mutton; the news\r\nspreads and the sharks come from all over the Pacific Ocean to get the\r\nfree board.  In time the shark culture will be one of the most successful\r\nthings in the colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nWe can secure other people's approval, if we do right and try hard; but\r\nour own is worth a hundred of it, and no way has been found out of\r\nsecuring that.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nMy health had broken down in New York in May; it had remained in a\r\ndoubtful but fairish condition during a succeeding period of 82 days; it\r\nbroke again on the Pacific.  It broke again in Sydney, but not until\r\nafter I had had a good outing, and had also filled my lecture\r\nengagements.  This latest break lost me the chance of seeing Queensland.\r\nIn the circumstances, to go north toward hotter weather was not\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nSo we moved south with a westward slant, 17 hours by rail to the capital\r\nof the colony of Victoria, Melbourne--that juvenile city of sixty years,\r\nand half a million inhabitants.  On the map the distance looked small;\r\nbut that is a trouble with all divisions of distance in such a vast\r\ncountry as Australia.  The colony of Victoria itself looks small on the\r\nmap--looks like a county, in fact--yet it is about as large as England,\r\nScotland, and Wales combined.  Or, to get another focus upon it, it is\r\njust 80 times as large as the state of Rhode Island, and one-third as\r\nlarge as the State of Texas.\r\n\r\nOutside of Melbourne, Victoria seems to be owned by a handful of\r\nsquatters, each with a Rhode Island for a sheep farm.  That is the\r\nimpression which one gathers from common talk, yet the wool industry of\r\nVictoria is by no means so great as that of New South Wales.  The climate\r\nof Victoria is favorable to other great industries--among others,\r\nwheat-growing and the making of wine.\r\n\r\nWe took the train at Sydney at about four in the afternoon.  It was\r\nAmerican in one way, for we had a most rational sleeping car; also the\r\ncar was clean and fine and new--nothing about it to suggest the rolling\r\nstock of the continent of Europe.  But our baggage was weighed, and extra\r\nweight charged for.  That was continental.  Continental and troublesome.\r\nAny detail of railroading that is not troublesome cannot honorably be\r\ndescribed as continental.\r\n\r\nThe tickets were round-trip ones--to Melbourne, and clear to Adelaide in\r\nSouth Australia, and then all the way back to Sydney.  Twelve hundred\r\nmore miles than we really expected to make; but then as the round trip\r\nwouldn't cost much more than the single trip, it seemed well enough to\r\nbuy as many miles as one could afford, even if one was not likely to need\r\nthem.  A human being has a natural desire to have more of a good thing\r\nthan he needs.\r\n\r\nNow comes a singular thing: the oddest thing, the strangest thing, the\r\nmost baffling and unaccountable marvel that Australasia can show.  At the\r\nfrontier between New South Wales and Victoria our multitude of passengers\r\nwere routed out of their snug beds by lantern-light in the morning in the\r\nbiting-cold of a high altitude to change cars on a road that has no break\r\nin it from Sydney to Melbourne!  Think of the paralysis of intellect that\r\ngave that idea birth; imagine the boulder it emerged from on some\r\npetrified legislator's shoulders.\r\n\r\nIt is a narrow-gage road to the frontier, and a broader gauge thence to\r\nMelbourne.  The two governments were the builders of the road and are the\r\nowners of it.  One or two reasons are given for this curious state of\r\nthings.  One is, that it represents the jealousy existing between the\r\ncolonies--the two most important colonies of Australasia.  What the other\r\none is, I have forgotten.  But it is of no consequence.  It could be but\r\nanother effort to explain the inexplicable.\r\n\r\nAll passengers fret at the double-gauge; all shippers of freight must of\r\ncourse fret at it; unnecessary expense, delay, and annoyance are imposed\r\nupon everybody concerned, and no one is benefitted.\r\n\r\nEach Australian colony fences itself off from its neighbor with a\r\ncustom-house.  Personally, I have no objection, but it must be a good\r\ndeal of inconvenience to the people.  We have something resembling it\r\nhere and there in America, but it goes by another name.  The large empire\r\nof the Pacific coast requires a world of iron machinery, and could\r\nmanufacture it economically on the spot if the imposts on foreign iron\r\nwere removed. But they are not.  Protection to Pennsylvania and Alabama\r\nforbids it. The result to the Pacific coast is the same as if there were\r\nseveral rows of custom-fences between the coast and the East.  Iron\r\ncarted across the American continent at luxurious railway rates would be\r\nvaluable enough to be coined when it arrived.\r\n\r\nWe changed cars.  This was at Albury.  And it was there, I think, that\r\nthe growing day and the early sun exposed the distant range called the\r\nBlue Mountains.  Accurately named.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d as the Australians say,\r\nbut it was a stunning color, that blue.  Deep, strong, rich, exquisite;\r\ntowering and majestic masses of blue--a softly luminous blue, a\r\nsmouldering blue, as if vaguely lit by fires within.  It extinguished the\r\nblue of the sky--made it pallid and unwholesome, whitey and washed-out.\r\nA wonderful color--just divine.\r\n\r\nA resident told me that those were not mountains; he said they were\r\nrabbit-piles.  And explained that long exposure and the over-ripe\r\ncondition of the rabbits was what made them look so blue.  This man may\r\nhave been right, but much reading of books of travel has made me\r\ndistrustful of gratis information furnished by unofficial residents of a\r\ncountry.  The facts which such people give to travelers are usually\r\nerroneous, and often intemperately so.  The rabbit-plague has indeed been\r\nvery bad in Australia, and it could account for one mountain, but not for\r\na mountain range, it seems to me.  It is too large an order.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted at the station.  A good breakfast, except the coffee; and\r\ncheap.  The Government establishes the prices and placards them.  The\r\nwaiters were men, I think; but that is not usual in Australasia.  The\r\nusual thing is to have girls.  No, not girls, young ladies--generally\r\nduchesses.  Dress?  They would attract attention at any royal levee in\r\nEurope.  Even empresses and queens do not dress as they do.  Not that\r\nthey could not afford it, perhaps, but they would not know how.\r\n\r\nAll the pleasant morning we slid smoothly along over the plains, through\r\nthin--not thick--forests of great melancholy gum trees, with trunks\r\nrugged with curled sheets of flaking bark--erysipelas convalescents, so\r\nto speak, shedding their dead skins.  And all along were tiny cabins,\r\nbuilt sometimes of wood, sometimes of gray-blue corrugated iron; and\r\nthe doorsteps and fences were clogged with children--rugged little\r\nsimply-clad chaps that looked as if they had been imported from the\r\nbanks of the Mississippi without breaking bulk.\r\n\r\nAnd there were little villages, with neat stations well placarded with\r\nshowy advertisements--mainly of almost too self-righteous brands of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csheepdip.\xe2\x80\x9d  If that is the name--and I think it is.  It is a stuff like\r\ntar, and is dabbed on to places where the shearer clips a piece out of\r\nthe sheep.  It bars out the flies, and has healing properties, and a nip\r\nto it which makes the sheep skip like the cattle on a thousand hills.  It\r\nis not good to eat.  That is, it is not good to eat except when mixed\r\nwith railroad coffee.  It improves railroad coffee.  Without it railroad\r\ncoffee is too vague.  But with it, it is quite assertive and\r\nenthusiastic.  By itself, railroad coffee is too passive; but sheep-dip\r\nmakes it wake up and get down to business.  I wonder where they get\r\nrailroad coffee?\r\n\r\nWe saw birds, but not a kangaroo, not an emu, not an ornithorhynchus, not\r\na lecturer, not a native.  Indeed, the land seemed quite destitute of\r\ngame.  But I have misused the word native.  In Australia it is applied to\r\nAustralian-born whites only.  I should have said that we saw no\r\nAboriginals--no \xe2\x80\x9cblackfellows.\xe2\x80\x9d  And to this day I have never seen one.\r\nIn the great museums you will find all the other curiosities, but in the\r\ncurio of chiefest interest to the stranger all of them are lacking.  We\r\nhave at home an abundance of museums, and not an American Indian in them.\r\nIt is clearly an absurdity, but it never struck me before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTruth is stranger than fiction--to some people, but I am measurably\r\nfamiliar with it.\r\n                             --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nTruth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to\r\nstick to possibilities; Truth isn't.\r\n                             --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe air was balmy and delicious, the sunshine radiant; it was a charming\r\nexcursion.  In the course of it we came to a town whose odd name was\r\nfamous all over the world a quarter of a century ago--Wagga-Wagga.  This\r\nwas because the Tichborne Claimant had kept a butcher-shop there.  It was\r\nout of the midst of his humble collection of sausages and tripe that he\r\nsoared up into the zenith of notoriety and hung there in the wastes of\r\nspace a time, with the telescopes of all nations leveled at him in\r\nunappeasable curiosity--curiosity as to which of the two long-missing\r\npersons he was:  Arthur Orton, the mislaid roustabout of Wapping, or Sir\r\nRoger Tichborne, the lost heir of a name and estates as old as English\r\nhistory.  We all know now, but not a dozen people knew then; and the\r\ndozen kept the mystery to themselves and allowed the most intricate and\r\nfascinating and marvelous real-life romance that has ever been played\r\nupon the world's stage to unfold itself serenely, act by act, in a\r\nBritish court by the long and laborious processes of judicial\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nWhen we recall the details of that great romance we marvel to see what\r\ndaring chances truth may freely take in constructing a tale, as compared\r\nwith the poor little conservative risks permitted to fiction.  The\r\nfiction-artist could achieve no success with the materials of this\r\nsplendid Tichborne romance.\r\n\r\nHe would have to drop out the chief characters; the public would say such\r\npeople are impossible.  He would have to drop out a number of the most\r\npicturesque incidents; the public would say such things could never\r\nhappen.  And yet the chief characters did exist, and the incidents did\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\nIt cost the Tichborne estates $400,000 to unmask the Claimant and drive\r\nhim out; and even after the exposure multitudes of Englishmen still\r\nbelieved in him.  It cost the British Government another $400,000 to\r\nconvict him of perjury; and after the conviction the same old multitudes\r\nstill believed in him; and among these believers were many educated and\r\nintelligent men; and some of them had personally known the real Sir\r\nRoger.  The Claimant was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment.  When he\r\ngot out of prison he went to New York and kept a whisky saloon in the\r\nBowery for a time, then disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nHe always claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne until death called for him.\r\nThis was but a few months ago--not very much short of a generation since\r\nhe left Wagga-Wagga to go and possess himself of his estates.  On his\r\ndeath-bed he yielded up his secret, and confessed in writing that he was\r\nonly Arthur Orton of Wapping, able seaman and butcher--that and nothing\r\nmore.  But it is scarcely to be doubted that there are people whom even\r\nhis dying confession will not convince.  The old habit of assimilating\r\nincredibilities must have made strong food a necessity in their case; a\r\nweaker article would probably disagree with them.\r\n\r\nI was in London when the Claimant stood his trial for perjury.  I\r\nattended one of his showy evenings in the sumptuous quarters provided for\r\nhim from the purses of his adherents and well-wishers.  He was in evening\r\ndress, and I thought him a rather fine and stately creature.  There were\r\nabout twenty-five gentlemen present; educated men, men moving in good\r\nsociety, none of them commonplace; some of them were men of distinction,\r\nnone of them were obscurities.  They were his cordial friends and\r\nadmirers.  It was \xe2\x80\x9cSir Roger,\xe2\x80\x9d always \xe2\x80\x9cSir Roger,\xe2\x80\x9d on all hands; no one\r\nwithheld the title, all turned it from the tongue with unction, and as if\r\nit tasted good.\r\n\r\nFor many years I had had a mystery in stock.  Melbourne, and only\r\nMelbourne, could unriddle it for me.  In 1873 I arrived in London with my\r\nwife and young child, and presently received a note from Naples signed by\r\na name not familiar to me.  It was not Bascom, and it was not Henry; but\r\nI will call it Henry Bascom for convenience's sake.  This note, of about\r\nsix lines, was written on a strip of white paper whose end-edges were\r\nragged.  I came to be familiar with those strips in later years.  Their\r\nsize and pattern were always the same.  Their contents were usually to\r\nthe same effect: would I and mine come to the writer's country-place in\r\nEngland on such and such a date, by such and such a train, and stay\r\ntwelve days and depart by such and such a train at the end of the\r\nspecified time?  A carriage would meet us at the station.\r\n\r\nThese invitations were always for a long time ahead; if we were in\r\nEurope, three months ahead; if we were in America, six to twelve months\r\nahead.  They always named the exact date and train for the beginning and\r\nalso for the end of the visit.\r\n\r\nThis first note invited us for a date three months in the future.  It\r\nasked us to arrive by the 4.10 p.m. train from London, August 6th.  The\r\ncarriage would be waiting.  The carriage would take us away seven days\r\nlater-train specified.  And there were these words: \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to Tom\r\nHughes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI showed the note to the author of \xe2\x80\x9cTom Brown at Rugby,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAccept, and be thankful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe described Mr. Bascom as being a man of genius, a man of fine\r\nattainments, a choice man in every way, a rare and beautiful character.\r\nHe said that Bascom Hall was a particularly fine example of the stately\r\nmanorial mansion of Elizabeth's days, and that it was a house worth going\r\na long way to see--like Knowle; that Mr. B. was of a social disposition;\r\nliked the company of agreeable people, and always had samples of the sort\r\ncoming and going.\r\n\r\nWe paid the visit.  We paid others, in later years--the last one in 1879.\r\nSoon after that Mr. Bascom started on a voyage around the world in a\r\nsteam yacht--a long and leisurely trip, for he was making collections, in\r\nall lands, of birds, butterflies, and such things.\r\n\r\nThe day that President Garfield was shot by the assassin Guiteau, we were\r\nat a little watering place on Long Island Sound; and in the mail matter\r\nof that day came a letter with the Melbourne post-mark on it.  It was for\r\nmy wife, but I recognized Mr. Bascom's handwriting on the envelope, and\r\nopened it.  It was the usual note--as to paucity of lines--and was\r\nwritten on the customary strip of paper; but there was nothing usual\r\nabout the contents.  The note informed my wife that if it would be any\r\nassuagement of her grief to know that her husband's lecture-tour in\r\nAustralia was a satisfactory venture from the beginning to the end, he,\r\nthe writer, could testify that such was the case; also, that her\r\nhusband's untimely death had been mourned by all classes, as she would\r\nalready know by the press telegrams, long before the reception of this\r\nnote; that the funeral was attended by the officials of the colonial and\r\ncity governments; and that while he, the writer, her friend and mine, had\r\nnot reached Melbourne in time to see the body, he had at least had the\r\nsad privilege of acting as one of the pall-bearers.  Signed, \xe2\x80\x9cHenry\r\nBascom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy first thought was, why didn't he have the coffin opened?  He would\r\nhave seen that the corpse was an imposter, and he could have gone right\r\nahead and dried up the most of those tears, and comforted those sorrowing\r\ngovernments, and sold the remains and sent me the money.\r\n\r\nI did nothing about the matter.  I had set the law after living lecture\r\ndoubles of mine a couple of times in America, and the law had not been\r\nable to catch them; others in my trade had tried to catch their\r\nimpostor-doubles and had failed.  Then where was the use in harrying a\r\nghost? None--and so I did not disturb it.  I had a curiosity to know\r\nabout that man's lecture-tour and last moments, but that could wait.\r\nWhen I should see Mr. Bascom he would tell me all about it.  But he\r\npassed from life, and I never saw him again..  My curiosity faded away.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I found that I was going to Australia it revived.  And\r\nnaturally: for if the people should say that I was a dull, poor thing\r\ncompared to what I was before I died, it would have a bad effect on\r\nbusiness.  Well, to my surprise the Sydney journalists had never heard of\r\nthat impostor!  I pressed them, but they were firm--they had never heard\r\nof him, and didn't believe in him.\r\n\r\nI could not understand it; still, I thought it would all come right in\r\nMelbourne.  The government would remember; and the other mourners.  At\r\nthe supper of the Institute of Journalists I should find out all about\r\nthe matter.  But no--it turned out that they had never heard of it.\r\n\r\nSo my mystery was a mystery still.  It was a great disappointment.  I\r\nbelieved it would never be cleared up--in this life--so I dropped it out\r\nof my mind.\r\n\r\nBut at last! just when I was least expecting it----\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the place for the rest of it; I shall come to the\r\nmatter again, in a far-distant chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nThere is a Moral sense, and there is an Immoral Sense.  History shows us\r\nthat the Moral Sense enables us to perceive morality and how to avoid it,\r\nand that the Immoral Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how to\r\nenjoy it.\r\n                              -Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nMelbourne spreads around over an immense area of ground.  It is a stately\r\ncity architecturally as well as in magnitude.  It has an elaborate system\r\nof cable-car service; it has museums, and colleges, and schools, and\r\npublic gardens, and electricity, and gas, and libraries, and theaters,\r\nand mining centers, and wool centers, and centers of the arts and\r\nsciences, and boards of trade, and ships, and railroads, and a harbor,\r\nand social clubs, and journalistic clubs, and racing clubs, and a\r\nsquatter club sumptuously housed and appointed, and as many churches and\r\nbanks as can make a living.  In a word, it is equipped with everything\r\nthat goes to make the modern great city.  It is the largest city of\r\nAustralasia, and fills the post with honor and credit.  It has one\r\nspecialty; this must not be jumbled in with those other things.  It is\r\nthe mitred Metropolitan of the Horse-Racing Cult.  Its race-ground is the\r\nMecca of Australasia.  On the great annual day of sacrifice--the 5th of\r\nNovember, Guy Fawkes's Day--business is suspended over a stretch of land\r\nand sea as wide as from New York to San Francisco, and deeper than from\r\nthe northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico; and every man and woman, of\r\nhigh degree or low, who can afford the expense, put away their other\r\nduties and come.  They begin to swarm in by ship and rail a fortnight\r\nbefore the day, and they swarm thicker and thicker day after day, until\r\nall the vehicles of transportation are taxed to their uttermost to meet\r\nthe demands of the occasion, and all hotels and lodgings are bulging\r\noutward because of the pressure from within.  They come a hundred\r\nthousand strong, as all the best authorities say, and they pack the\r\nspacious grounds and grandstands and make a spectacle such as is never to\r\nbe seen in Australasia elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt is the \xe2\x80\x9cMelbourne Cup\xe2\x80\x9d that brings this multitude together.  Their\r\nclothes have been ordered long ago, at unlimited cost, and without bounds\r\nas to beauty and magnificence, and have been kept in concealment until\r\nnow, for unto this day are they consecrate.  I am speaking of the ladies'\r\nclothes; but one might know that.\r\n\r\nAnd so the grand-stands make a brilliant and wonderful spectacle, a\r\ndelirium of color, a vision of beauty.  The champagne flows, everybody is\r\nvivacious, excited, happy; everybody bets, and gloves and fortunes change\r\nhands right along, all the time.  Day after day the races go on, and the\r\nfun and the excitement are kept at white heat; and when each day is done,\r\nthe people dance all night so as to be fresh for the race in the morning.\r\nAnd at the end of the great week the swarms secure lodgings and\r\ntransportation for next year, then flock away to their remote homes and\r\ncount their gains and losses, and order next year's Cup-clothes, and then\r\nlie down and sleep two weeks, and get up sorry to reflect that a whole\r\nyear must be put in somehow or other before they can be wholly happy\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day.  It would be\r\ndifficult to overstate its importance.  It overshadows all other holidays\r\nand specialized days of whatever sort in that congeries of colonies.\r\nOvershadows them?  I might almost say it blots them out.  Each of them\r\ngets attention, but not everybody's; each of them evokes interest, but\r\nnot everybody's; each of them rouses enthusiasm, but not everybody's; in\r\neach case a part of the attention, interest, and enthusiasm is a matter\r\nof habit and custom, and another part of it is official and perfunctory.\r\nCup Day, and Cup Day only, commands an attention, an interest, and an\r\nenthusiasm which are universal--and spontaneous, not perfunctory.  Cup\r\nDay is supreme--it has no rival.  I can call to mind no specialized\r\nannual\r\nday, in any country, which can be named by that large name--Supreme.  I\r\ncan call to mind no specialized annual day, in any country, whose\r\napproach fires the whole land with a conflagration of conversation and\r\npreparation and anticipation and jubilation.  No day save this one; but\r\nthis one does it.\r\n\r\nIn America we have no annual supreme day; no day whose approach makes the\r\nwhole nation glad.  We have the Fourth of July, and Christmas, and\r\nThanksgiving.  Neither of them can claim the primacy; neither of them can\r\narouse an enthusiasm which comes near to being universal.  Eight grown\r\nAmericans out of ten dread the coming of the Fourth, with its pandemonium\r\nand its perils, and they rejoice when it is gone--if still alive.  The\r\napproach of Christmas brings harassment and dread to many excellent\r\npeople.  They have to buy a cart-load of presents, and they never know\r\nwhat to buy to hit the various tastes; they put in three weeks of hard\r\nand anxious work, and when Christmas morning comes they are so\r\ndissatisfied with the result, and so disappointed that they want to sit\r\ndown and cry.  Then they give thanks that Christmas comes but once a\r\nyear.  The observance of Thanksgiving Day--as a function--has become\r\ngeneral of late years.  The Thankfulness is not so general.  This is\r\nnatural.  Two-thirds of the nation have always had hard luck and a hard\r\ntime during the year, and this has a calming effect upon their\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWe have a supreme day--a sweeping and tremendous and tumultuous day, a\r\nday which commands an absolute universality of interest and excitement;\r\nbut it is not annual.  It comes but once in four years; therefore it\r\ncannot count as a rival of the Melbourne Cup.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain and Ireland they have two great days--Christmas and the\r\nQueen's birthday.  But they are equally popular; there is no supremacy.\r\n\r\nI think it must be conceded that the position of the Australasian Day is\r\nunique, solitary, unfellowed; and likely to hold that high place a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe next things which interest us when we travel are, first, the people;\r\nnext, the novelties; and finally the history of the places and countries\r\nvisited.  Novelties are rare in cities which represent the most advanced\r\ncivilization of the modern day.  When one is familiar with such cities in\r\nthe other parts of the world he is in effect familiar with the cities of\r\nAustralasia.  The outside aspects will furnish little that is new.  There\r\nwill be new names, but the things which they represent will sometimes be\r\nfound to be less new than their names.  There may be shades of\r\ndifference, but these can easily be too fine for detection by the\r\nincompetent eye of the passing stranger.  In the larrikin he will not be\r\nable to discover a new species, but only an old one met elsewhere, and\r\nvariously called loafer, rough, tough, bummer, or blatherskite, according\r\nto his geographical distribution.  The larrikin differs by a shade from\r\nthose others, in that he is more sociable toward the stranger than they,\r\nmore kindly disposed, more hospitable, more hearty, more friendly.  At\r\nleast it seemed so to me, and I had opportunity to observe.  In Sydney,\r\nat least.  In Melbourne I had to drive to and from the lecture-theater,\r\nbut in Sydney I was able to walk both ways, and did it.  Every night, on\r\nmy way home at ten, or a quarter past, I found the larrikin grouped in\r\nconsiderable force at several of the street corners, and he always gave\r\nme this pleasant salutation:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Mark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere's to you, old chap!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay--Mark!--is he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d--a reference to a passage in some book of mine,\r\nthough I did not detect, at that time, that that was its source.  And I\r\ndidn't detect it afterward in Melbourne, when I came on the stage for the\r\nfirst time, and the same question was dropped down upon me from the dizzy\r\nheight of the gallery.  It is always difficult to answer a sudden inquiry\r\nlike that, when you have come unprepared and don't know what it means.\r\nI will remark here--if it is not an indecorum--that the welcome which an\r\nAmerican lecturer gets from a British colonial audience is a thing which\r\nwill move him to his deepest deeps, and veil his sight and break his\r\nvoice.  And from Winnipeg to Africa, experience will teach him nothing;\r\nhe will never learn to expect it, it will catch him as a surprise each\r\ntime.  The war-cloud hanging black over England and America made no\r\ntrouble for me.  I was a prospective prisoner of war, but at dinners,\r\nsuppers, on the platform, and elsewhere, there was never anything to\r\nremind me of it.  This was hospitality of the right metal, and would have\r\nbeen prominently lacking in some countries, in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of the war-flurry, it seemed to me to bring to light the\r\nunexpected, in a detail or two.  It seemed to relegate the war-talk to\r\nthe politicians on both sides of the water; whereas whenever a\r\nprospective war between two nations had been in the air theretofore, the\r\npublic had done most of the talking and the bitterest.  The attitude of\r\nthe newspapers was new also.  I speak of those of Australasia and India,\r\nfor I had access to those only.  They treated the subject argumentatively\r\nand with dignity, not with spite and anger.  That was a new spirit, too,\r\nand not learned of the French and German press, either before Sedan or\r\nsince.  I heard many public speeches, and they reflected the moderation\r\nof the journals.  The outlook is that the English-speaking race will\r\ndominate the earth a hundred years from now, if its sections do not get\r\nto fighting each other.  It would be a pity to spoil that prospect by\r\nbaffling and retarding wars when arbitration would settle their\r\ndifferences so much better and also so much more definitely.\r\n\r\nNo, as I have suggested, novelties are rare in the great capitals of\r\nmodern times.  Even the wool exchange in Melbourne could not be told from\r\nthe familiar stock exchange of other countries.  Wool brokers are just\r\nlike stockbrokers; they all bounce from their seats and put up their\r\nhands and yell in unison--no stranger can tell what--and the president\r\ncalmly says \xe2\x80\x9cSold to Smith & Co., threpence farthing--next!\xe2\x80\x9d--when\r\nprobably nothing of the kind happened; for how should he know?\r\n\r\nIn the museums you will find acres of the most strange and fascinating\r\nthings; but all museums are fascinating, and they do so tire your eyes,\r\nand break your back, and burn out your vitalities with their consuming\r\ninterest.  You always say you will never go again, but you do go.  The\r\npalaces of the rich, in Melbourne, are much like the palaces of the rich\r\nin America, and the life in them is the same; but there the resemblance\r\nends.  The grounds surrounding the American palace are not often large,\r\nand not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case the grounds are often\r\nducally spacious, and the climate and the gardeners together make them as\r\nbeautiful as a dream.  It is said that some of the country seats have\r\ngrounds--domains--about them which rival in charm and magnitude those\r\nwhich surround the country mansion of an English lord; but I was not out\r\nin the country; I had my hands full in town.\r\n\r\nAnd what was the origin of this majestic city and its efflorescence of\r\npalatial town houses and country seats?  Its first brick was laid and\r\nits first house built by a passing convict.  Australian history is almost\r\nalways picturesque; indeed, it is so curious and strange, that it is\r\nitself the chiefest novelty the country has to offer, and so it pushes\r\nthe other novelties into second and third place.  It does not read like\r\nhistory, but like the most beautiful lies.  And all of a fresh new sort,\r\nno mouldy old stale ones.  It is full of surprises, and adventures, and\r\nincongruities, and contradictions, and incredibilities; but they are all\r\ntrue, they all happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nThe English are mentioned in the Bible: Blessed are the meek, for they\r\nshall inherit the earth.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the immensity of the British Empire in territory,\r\npopulation, and trade, it requires a stern exercise of faith to believe\r\nin the figures which represent Australasia's contribution to the Empire's\r\ncommercial grandeur.  As compared with the landed estate of the British\r\nEmpire, the landed estate dominated by any other Power except one\r\n--Russia--is not very impressive for size.  My authorities make the\r\nBritish\r\nEmpire not much short of a fourth larger than the Russian Empire.\r\nRoughly proportioned, if you will allow your entire hand to represent the\r\nBritish Empire, you may then cut off the fingers a trifle above the\r\nmiddle joint of the middle finger, and what is left of the hand will\r\nrepresent Russia.  The populations ruled by Great Britain and China are\r\nabout the same--400,000,000 each.  No other Power approaches these\r\nfigures.  Even Russia is left far behind.\r\n\r\nThe population of Australasia--4,000,000--sinks into nothingness, and is\r\nlost from sight in that British ocean of 400,000,000.  Yet the statistics\r\nindicate that it rises again and shows up very conspicuously when its\r\nshare of the Empire's commerce is the matter under consideration.  The\r\nvalue of England's annual exports and imports is stated at three billions\r\nof dollars,--[New South Wales Blue Book.]--and it is claimed that more\r\nthan one-tenth of this great aggregate is represented by Australasia's\r\nexports to England and imports from England.  In addition to this,\r\nAustralasia does a trade with countries other than England, amounting to\r\na hundred million dollars a year, and a domestic intercolonial trade\r\namounting to a hundred and fifty millions.\r\n\r\nIn round numbers the 4,000,000 buy and sell about $600,000,000 worth of\r\ngoods a year.  It is claimed that about half of this represents\r\ncommodities of Australasian production.  The products exported annually\r\nby India are worth a trifle over $500,000,000.  Now, here are some\r\nfaith-straining figures:\r\n\r\nIndian production (300,000,000 population), $500,000,000.\r\n\r\nAustralasian production (4,000,000 population), $300,000,000.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, the product of the individual Indian, annually (for\r\nexport some whither), is worth $1.75; that of the individual\r\nAustralasian (for export some whither), $75! Or, to put it in another\r\nway, the Indian family of man and wife and three children sends away an\r\nannual result worth $8.75, while the Australasian family sends away $375\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nThere are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard Temple and\r\nothers, which show that the individual Indian's whole annual product,\r\nboth for export and home use, is worth in gold only $7.50; or, $37.50\r\nfor the family-aggregate.  Ciphered out on a like ratio of\r\nmultiplication, the Australasian family's aggregate production would be\r\nnearly $1,600.  Truly, nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they once\r\nget started.\r\n\r\nWe left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the vast Province\r\nof South Australia--a seventeen-hour excursion.  On the train we found\r\nseveral Sydney friends; among them a Judge who was going out on circuit,\r\nand was going to hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silver\r\nmine is.  It seemed a curious road to take to get to that region.  Broken\r\nHill is close to the western border of New South Wales, and Sydney is on\r\nthe eastern border.  A fairly straight line, 700 miles long, drawn\r\nwestward from Sydney, would strike Broken Hill, just as a somewhat\r\nshorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo.  The way the\r\nJudge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by rail, he said;\r\nsouthwest from Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide,\r\nthen a cant back northeastward and over the border into New South Wales\r\nonce more--to Broken Hill.  It was like going from Boston southwest to\r\nRichmond, Virginia, then northwest up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cant\r\nback northeast and over the border--to Buffalo, New York.\r\n\r\nBut the explanation was simple.  Years ago the fabulously rich silver\r\ndiscovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an unexpectant world.  Its\r\nstocks started at shillings, and went by leaps and bounds to the most\r\nfanciful figures.  It was one of those cases where the cook puts a\r\nmonth's wages into shares, and comes next month and buys your house at\r\nyour own price, and moves into it herself; where the coachman takes a few\r\nshares, and next month sets up a bank; and where the common sailor\r\ninvests the price of a spree, and the next month buys out the steamship\r\ncompany and goes into business on his own hook.  In a word, it was one of\r\nthose excitements which bring multitudes of people to a common center\r\nwith a rush, and whose needs must be supplied, and at once.  Adelaide was\r\nclose by, Sydney was far away.  Adelaide threw a short railway across the\r\nborder before Sydney had time to arrange for a long one; it was not worth\r\nwhile for Sydney to arrange at all.  The whole vast trade-profit of\r\nBroken Hill fell into Adelaide's hands, irrevocably.  New South Wales\r\nfurnishes law for Broken Hill and sends her Judges 2,000 miles--mainly\r\nthrough alien countries--to administer it, but Adelaide takes the\r\ndividends and makes no moan.\r\n\r\nWe started at 4.20 in the afternoon, and moved across level plains until\r\nnight. In the morning we had a stretch of \xe2\x80\x9cscrub\xe2\x80\x9d country--the kind of\r\nthing\r\nwhich is so useful to the Australian novelist.  In the scrub the hostile\r\naboriginal lurks, and flits mysteriously about, slipping out from time to\r\ntime to surprise and slaughter the settler; then slipping back again, and\r\nleaving no track that the white man can follow.  In the scrub the\r\nnovelist's heroine gets lost, search fails of result; she wanders here\r\nand there, and finally sinks down exhausted and unconscious, and the\r\nsearchers pass within a yard or two of her, not suspecting that she is\r\nnear, and by and by some rambler finds her bones and the pathetic diary\r\nwhich she had scribbled with her failing hand and left behind.  Nobody\r\ncan find a lost heroine in the scrub but the aboriginal \xe2\x80\x9ctracker,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\nwill not lend himself to the scheme if it will interfere with the\r\nnovelist's plot.  The scrub stretches miles and miles in all directions,\r\nand looks like a level roof of bush-tops without a break or a crack in it\r\n--as seamless as a blanket, to all appearance.  One might as well walk\r\nunder water and hope to guess out a route and stick to it, I should\r\nthink.  Yet it is claimed that the aboriginal \xe2\x80\x9ctracker\xe2\x80\x9d was able to hunt\r\nout people lost in the scrub.  Also in the \xe2\x80\x9cbush\xe2\x80\x9d; also in the desert;\r\nand even follow them over patches of bare rocks and over alluvial ground\r\nwhich had to all appearance been washed clear of footprints.\r\n\r\nFrom reading Australian books and talking with the people, I became\r\nconvinced that the aboriginal tracker's performances evince a craft, a\r\npenetration, a luminous sagacity, and a minuteness and accuracy of\r\nobservation in the matter of detective-work not found in nearly so\r\nremarkable a degree in any other people, white or colored.  In an\r\nofficial account of the blacks of Australia published by the government\r\nof Victoria, one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the faint\r\nmarks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing opossum, but\r\nknows in some way or other whether the marks were made to-day or\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nAnd there is the case, on record where A., a settler, makes a bet with\r\nB., that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can, and A. will produce\r\nan aboriginal who will find her.  B. selects a cow and lets the tracker\r\nsee the cow's footprint, then be put under guard.  B. then drives the cow\r\na few miles over a course which drifts in all directions, and frequently\r\ndoubles back upon itself; and he selects difficult ground all the time,\r\nand once or twice even drives the cow through herds of other cows, and\r\nmingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs.  He finally brings\r\nhis cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, and at once moves around\r\nin a great circle, examining all cow-tracks until he finds the one he is\r\nafter; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic course, and\r\nultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the cow.  Now\r\nwherein does one cow-track differ from another?  There must be a\r\ndifference, or the tracker could not have performed the feat; a\r\ndifference minute, shadowy, and not detectible by you or me, or by the\r\nlate Sherlock Holmes, and yet discernible by a member of a race charged\r\nby some people with occupying the bottom place in the gradations of human\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to stay out than get out.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe train was now exploring a beautiful hill country, and went twisting\r\nin and out through lovely little green valleys.  There were several\r\nvarieties of gum trees; among them many giants.  Some of them were bodied\r\nand barked like the sycamore; some were of fantastic aspect, and reminded\r\none of the quaint apple trees in Japanese pictures.  And there was one\r\npeculiarly beautiful tree whose name and breed I did not know.  The\r\nfoliage seemed to consist of big bunches of pine-spines, the lower half\r\nof each bunch a rich brown or old-gold color, the upper half a most vivid\r\nand strenuous and shouting green.  The effect was altogether bewitching.\r\nThe tree was apparently rare.  I should say that the first and last\r\nsamples of it seen by us were not more than half an hour apart.  There\r\nwas another tree of striking aspect, a kind of pine, we were told.  Its\r\nfoliage was as fine as hair, apparently, and its mass sphered itself\r\nabove the naked straight stem like an explosion of misty smoke.  It was\r\nnot a sociable sort; it did not gather in groups or couples, but each\r\nindividual stood far away from its nearest neighbor.  It scattered itself\r\nin this spacious and exclusive fashion about the slopes of swelling\r\ngrassy great knolls, and stood in the full flood of the wonderful\r\nsunshine; and as far as you could see the tree itself you could also see\r\nthe ink-black blot of its shadow on the shining green carpet at its feet.\r\n\r\nOn some part of this railway journey we saw gorse and broom--importations\r\nfrom England--and a gentleman who came into our compartment on a visit\r\ntried to tell me which--was which; but as he didn't know, he had\r\ndifficulty.  He said he was ashamed of his ignorance, but that he had\r\nnever been confronted with the question before during the fifty years and\r\nmore that he had spent in Australia, and so he had never happened to get\r\ninterested in the matter.  But there was no need to be ashamed.  The most\r\nof us have his defect.  We take a natural interest in novelties, but it\r\nis against nature to take an interest in familiar things.  The gorse and\r\nthe broom were a fine accent in the landscape.  Here and there they burst\r\nout in sudden conflagrations of vivid yellow against a background of\r\nsober or sombre color, with a so startling effect as to make a body catch\r\nhis breath with the happy surprise of it.  And then there was the wattle,\r\na native bush or tree, an inspiring cloud of sumptuous yellow bloom.  It\r\nis a favorite with the Australians, and has a fine fragrance, a quality\r\nusually wanting in Australian blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who enriched me with the poverty of his information about\r\nthe\r\ngorse and the broom told me that he came out from England a youth of\r\ntwenty and entered the Province of South Australia with thirty-six\r\nshillings in his pocket--an adventurer without trade, profession, or\r\nfriends, but with a clearly-defined purpose in his head: he would stay\r\nuntil he was worth L200, then go back home.  He would allow himself five\r\nyears for the accumulation of this fortune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was more than fifty years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here I am, yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he went out at the door he met a friend, and turned and introduced him\r\nto me, and the friend and I had a talk and a smoke.  I spoke of the\r\nprevious conversation and said there was something very pathetic about\r\nthis\r\nhalf century of exile, and that I wished the L200 scheme had succeeded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith him?  Oh, it did.  It's not so sad a case.  He is modest, and he\r\nleft out some of the particulars.  The lad reached South Australia just\r\nin time to help discover the Burra-Burra copper mines.  They turned out\r\nL700,000 in the first three years.  Up to now they have yielded\r\nL20,000,000.  He has had his share.  Before that boy had been in the\r\ncountry two years he could have gone home and bought a village; he could\r\ngo now and buy a city, I think.  No, there is nothing very pathetic about\r\nhis case.  He and his copper arrived at just a handy time to save South\r\nAustralia.  It had got mashed pretty flat under the collapse of a land\r\nboom a while before.\xe2\x80\x9d  There it is again; picturesque history\r\n--Australia's specialty.  In 1829 South Australia hadn't a white man in\r\nit.\r\nIn 1836 the British Parliament erected it--still a solitude--into a\r\nProvince, and gave it a governor and other governmental machinery.\r\nSpeculators took hold, now, and inaugurated a vast land scheme, and\r\ninvited immigration, encouraging it with lurid promises of sudden wealth.\r\nIt was well worked in London; and bishops, statesmen, and all sorts of\r\npeople made a rush for the land company's shares.  Immigrants soon began\r\nto pour into the region of Adelaide and select town lots and farms in the\r\nsand and the mangrove swamps by the sea.  The crowds continued to come,\r\nprices of land rose high, then higher and still higher, everybody was\r\nprosperous and happy, the boom swelled into gigantic proportions.  A\r\nvillage of sheet iron huts and clapboard sheds sprang up in the sand, and\r\nin these wigwams fashion made display; richly-dressed ladies played on\r\ncostly pianos, London swells in evening dress and patent-leather boots\r\nwere abundant, and this fine society drank champagne, and in other ways\r\nconducted itself in this capital of humble sheds as it had been\r\naccustomed to do in the aristocratic quarters of the metropolis of the\r\nworld.  The provincial government put up expensive buildings for its own\r\nuse, and a palace with gardens for the use of its governor.  The governor\r\nhad a guard, and maintained a court.  Roads, wharves, and hospitals were\r\nbuilt.  All this on credit, on paper, on wind, on inflated and fictitious\r\nvalues--on the boom's moonshine, in fact.  This went on handsomely during\r\nfour or five years.  Then all of a sudden came a smash.  Bills for a huge\r\namount drawn by the governor upon the Treasury were dishonored, land\r\ncompany's credit went up in smoke, a panic followed, values fell with a\r\nrush, the frightened immigrants seized their gripsacks and fled to other\r\nlands, leaving behind them a good imitation of a solitude, where lately\r\nhad been a buzzing and populous hive of men.\r\n\r\nAdelaide was indeed almost empty; its population had fallen to 3,000.\r\nDuring two years or more the death-trance continued.  Prospect of revival\r\nthere was none; hope of it ceased.  Then, as suddenly as the paralysis\r\nhad come, came the resurrection from it.  Those astonishingly rich copper\r\nmines were discovered, and the corpse got up and danced.\r\n\r\nThe wool production began to grow; grain-raising followed--followed so\r\nvigorously, too, that four or five years after the copper discovery, this\r\nlittle colony, which had had to import its breadstuffs formerly, and pay\r\nhard prices for them--once $50 a barrel for flour--had become an exporter\r\nof grain.\r\n\r\nThe prosperities continued.  After many years Providence, desiring to\r\nshow especial regard for New South Wales and exhibit a loving interest in\r\nits welfare which should certify to all nations the recognition of that\r\ncolony's conspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving,\r\nconferred upon it that treasury of inconceivable riches, Broken Hill; and\r\nSouth Australia went over the border and took it, giving thanks.\r\n\r\nAmong our passengers was an American with a unique vocation.  Unique is a\r\nstrong word, but I use it justifiably if I did not misconceive what the\r\nAmerican told me; for I understood him to say that in the world there was\r\nnot another man engaged in the business which he was following.  He was\r\nbuying the kangaroo-skin crop; buying all of it, both the Australian crop\r\nand the Tasmanian; and buying it for an American house in New York.  The\r\nprices were not high, as there was no competition, but the year's\r\naggregate of skins would cost him L30,000.  I had had the idea that the\r\nkangaroo was about extinct in Tasmania and well thinned out on the\r\ncontinent.  In America the skins are tanned and made into shoes.  After\r\nthe tanning, the leather takes a new name--which I have forgotten--I only\r\nremember that the new name does not indicate that the kangaroo furnishes\r\nthe leather.  There was a German competition for a while, some years ago,\r\nbut that has ceased.  The Germans failed to arrive at the secret of\r\ntanning the skins successfully, and they withdrew from the business.  Now\r\nthen, I suppose that I have seen a man whose occupation is really\r\nentitled to bear that high epithet--unique.  And I suppose that there is\r\nnot another occupation in the world that is restricted to the hands of a\r\nsole person.  I can think of no instance of it.  There is more than one\r\nPope, there is more than one Emperor, there is even more than one living\r\ngod, walking upon the earth and worshiped in all sincerity by large\r\npopulations of men.  I have seen and talked with two of these Beings\r\nmyself in India, and I have the autograph of one of them.  It can come\r\ngood, by and by, I reckon, if I attach it to a \xe2\x80\x9cpermit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApproaching Adelaide we dismounted from the train, as the French say, and\r\nwere driven in an open carriage over the hills and along their slopes to\r\nthe city.  It was an excursion of an hour or two, and the charm of it\r\ncould not be overstated, I think.  The road wound around gaps and gorges,\r\nand offered all varieties of scenery and prospect--mountains, crags,\r\ncountry homes, gardens, forests--color, color, color everywhere, and the\r\nair fine and fresh, the skies blue, and not a shred of cloud to mar the\r\ndownpour of the brilliant sunshine.  And finally the mountain gateway\r\nopened, and the immense plain lay spread out below and stretching away\r\ninto dim distances on every hand, soft and delicate and dainty and\r\nbeautiful.  On its near edge reposed the city.\r\n\r\nWe descended and entered.  There was nothing to remind one of the humble\r\ncapital, of huts and sheds of the long-vanished day of the land-boom.\r\nNo, this was a modern city, with wide streets, compactly built; with fine\r\nhomes everywhere, embowered in foliage and flowers, and with imposing\r\nmasses of public buildings nobly grouped and architecturally beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere was prosperity, in the air; for another boom was on.  Providence,\r\ndesiring to show especial regard for the neighboring colony on the west\r\ncalled Western Australia--and exhibit a loving interest in its welfare\r\nwhich should certify to all nations the recognition of that colony's\r\nconspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving, had recently\r\nconferred upon it that majestic treasury of golden riches, Coolgardie;\r\nand now South Australia had gone around the corner and taken it, giving\r\nthanks.  Everything comes to him who is patient and good, and waits.\r\n\r\nBut South Australia deserves much, for apparently she is a hospitable\r\nhome for every alien who chooses to come; and for his religion, too.\r\nShe has a population, as per the latest census, of only 320,000-odd, and\r\nyet her varieties of religion indicate the presence within her borders of\r\nsamples of people from pretty nearly every part of the globe you can\r\nthink of.  Tabulated, these varieties of religion make a remarkable show.\r\nOne would have to go far to find its match.  I copy here this\r\ncosmopolitan curiosity, and it comes from the published census:\r\n\r\nChurch of England,........... 89,271\r\nRoman Catholic,.............. 47,179\r\nWesleyan,.................... 49,159\r\nLutheran,.................... 23,328\r\nPresbyterian,................ 18,206\r\nCongregationalist,........... 11,882\r\nBible Christian,............. 15,762\r\nPrimitive Methodist,......... 11,654\r\nBaptist,..................... 17,547\r\nChristian Brethren,..........    465\r\nMethodist New Connexion,.....     39\r\nUnitarian,...................    688\r\nChurch of Christ,............  3,367\r\nSociety of Friends,..........    100\r\nSalvation Army,..............  4,356\r\nNew Jerusalem Church,........    168\r\nJews,........................    840\r\nProtestants (undefined),.....  5,532\r\nMohammedans,.................    299\r\nConfucians, etc.,............  3,884\r\nOther religions,.............  1,719\r\nObject,......................  6,940\r\nNot stated,..................  8,046\r\n\r\nTotal,.......................320,431\r\n\r\n\r\nThe item in the above list \xe2\x80\x9cOther religions\xe2\x80\x9d includes the following as\r\nreturned:\r\n\r\nAgnostics, 50\r\nAtheists, 22\r\nBelievers in Christ, 4\r\nBuddhists, 52\r\nCalvinists, 46\r\nChristadelphians, 134\r\nChristians, 308\r\nChrist's Chapel, 9\r\nChristian Israelites, 2\r\nChristian Socialists, 6\r\nChurch of God, 6\r\nCosmopolitans, 3\r\nDeists, 14\r\nEvangelists, 60\r\nExclusive Brethren, 8\r\nFree Church, 21\r\nFree Methodists, 5\r\nFreethinkers, 258\r\nFollowers of Christ, 8\r\nGospel Meetings, 11\r\nGreek Church, 44\r\nInfidels, 9\r\nMaronites, 2\r\nMemnonists, 1\r\nMoravians, 139\r\nMormons, 4\r\nNaturalists, 2\r\nOrthodox, 4\r\nOthers (indefinite), 17\r\nPagans, 20\r\nPantheists, 3\r\nPlymouth Brethren, 111\r\nRationalists, 4\r\nReformers, 7\r\nSecularists, 12\r\nSeventh-day Adventists, 203\r\nShaker, 1\r\nShintoists, 24\r\nSpiritualists, 37\r\nTheosophists, 9\r\nTown (City) Mission, 16\r\nWelsh Church, 27\r\nHuguenot, 2\r\nHussite, 1\r\nZoroastrians, 2\r\nZwinglian, 1\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 64 roads to the other world.  You see how healthy the religious\r\natmosphere is.  Anything can live in it.  Agnostics, Atheists,\r\nFreethinkers, Infidels, Mormons, Pagans, Indefinites they are all there.\r\nAnd all the big sects of the world can do more than merely live in it:\r\nthey can spread, flourish, prosper.  All except the Spiritualists and the\r\nTheosophists.  That is the most curious feature of this curious table.\r\nWhat is the matter with the specter?  Why do they puff him away?  He is a\r\nwelcome toy everywhere else in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPity is for the living, Envy is for the dead.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe successor of the sheet-iron hamlet of the mangrove marshes has that\r\nother Australian specialty, the Botanical Gardens.  We cannot have these\r\nparadises.  The best we could do would be to cover a vast acreage under\r\nglass and apply steam heat.  But it would be inadequate, the lacks would\r\nstill be so great: the confined sense, the sense of suffocation, the\r\natmospheric dimness, the sweaty heat--these would all be there, in place\r\nof the Australian openness to the sky, the sunshine and the breeze.\r\nWhatever will grow under glass with us will flourish rampantly out of\r\ndoors in Australia.--[The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is an\r\nauthoritative record of, was at Sandhurst, in January, 1862.  The\r\nthermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade.  In January, 1880,\r\nthe heat at Adelaide, South Australia, was 172 degrees in the sun.]\r\n\r\nWhen the white man came the continent was nearly as poor, in variety of\r\nvegetation, as the desert of Sahara; now it has everything that grows on\r\nthe earth.  In fact, not Australia only, but all Australasia has levied\r\ntribute upon the flora of the rest of the world; and wherever one goes\r\nthe results appear, in gardens private and public, in the woodsy walls of\r\nthe highways, and in even the forests.  If you see a curious or beautiful\r\ntree or bush or flower, and ask about it, the people, answering, usually\r\nname a foreign country as the place of its origin--India, Africa, Japan,\r\nChina, England, America, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, Polynesia, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn the Zoological Gardens of Adelaide I saw the only laughing jackass\r\nthat ever showed any disposition to be courteous to me.  This one opened\r\nhis head wide and laughed like a demon; or like a maniac who was consumed\r\nwith humorous scorn over a cheap and degraded pun.  It was a very human\r\nlaugh.  If he had been out of sight I could have believed that the\r\nlaughter came from a man.  It is an odd-looking bird, with a head and\r\nbeak that are much too large for its body.  In time man will exterminate\r\nthe rest of the wild creatures of Australia, but this one will probably\r\nsurvive, for man is his friend and lets him alone.  Man always has a good\r\nreason for his charities towards wild things, human or animal when he has\r\nany.  In this case the bird is spared because he kills snakes.  If L. J.\r\nwill take my advice he will not kill all of them.\r\n\r\nIn that garden I also saw the wild Australian dog--the dingo.  He was a\r\nbeautiful creature--shapely, graceful, a little wolfish in some of his\r\naspects, but with a most friendly eye and sociable disposition.  The\r\ndingo is not an importation; he was present in great force when the\r\nwhites first came to the continent.  It may be that he is the oldest dog\r\nin the universe; his origin, his descent, the place where his ancestors\r\nfirst appeared, are as unknown and as untraceable as are the camel's.\r\nHe is the most precious dog in the world, for he does not bark.  But in\r\nan evil hour he got to raiding the sheep-runs to appease his hunger, and\r\nthat sealed his doom.  He is hunted, now, just as if he were a wolf.\r\nHe has been sentenced to extermination, and the sentence will be carried\r\nout.  This is all right, and not objectionable.  The world was made for\r\nman--the white man.\r\n\r\nSouth Australia is confusingly named.  All of the colonies have a\r\nsouthern exposure except one--Queensland.  Properly speaking, South\r\nAustralia is middle Australia.  It extends straight up through the center\r\nof the continent like the middle board in a center-table.  It is 2,000\r\nmiles high, from south to north, and about a third as wide.  A wee little\r\nspot down in its southeastern corner contains eight or nine-tenths of its\r\npopulation; the other one or two-tenths are elsewhere--as elsewhere as\r\nthey could be in the United States with all the country between Denver\r\nand Chicago, and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico to scatter over.  There is\r\nplenty of room.\r\n\r\nA telegraph line stretches straight up north through that 2,000 miles of\r\nwilderness and desert from Adelaide to Port Darwin on the edge of the\r\nupper ocean.  South Australia built the line; and did it in 1871-2 when\r\nher population numbered only 185,000.  It was a great work; for there\r\nwere no roads, no paths; 1,300 miles of the route had been traversed but\r\nonce before by white men; provisions, wire, and poles had to be carried\r\nover immense stretches of desert; wells had to be dug along the route to\r\nsupply the men and cattle with water.\r\n\r\nA cable had been previously laid from Port Darwin to Java and thence to\r\nIndia, and there was telegraphic communication with England from India.\r\nAnd so, if Adelaide could make connection with Port Darwin it meant\r\nconnection with the whole world.  The enterprise succeeded.  One could\r\nwatch the London markets daily, now; the profit to the wool-growers of\r\nAustralia was instant and enormous.\r\n\r\nA telegram from Melbourne to San Francisco covers approximately 20,000\r\nmiles--the equivalent of five-sixths of the way around the globe.  It has\r\nto halt along the way a good many times and be repeated; still, but\r\nlittle time is lost.  These halts, and the distances between them, are\r\nhere tabulated.--[From \xe2\x80\x9cRound the Empire.\xe2\x80\x9d (George R.  Parkin), all but\r\nthe last two.]\r\n\r\n                              Miles.\r\n\r\nMelbourne-Mount Gambier,.......300\r\nMount Gambier-Adelaide,........270\r\nAdelaide-Port Augusta,.........200\r\nPort Augusta-Alice Springs...1,036\r\nAlice Springs-Port Darwin,.....898\r\nPort Darwin-Banjoewangie,... 1,150\r\nBanjoewangie-Batavia,..........480\r\nBatavia-Singapore,.............553\r\nSingapore-Penang,..............399\r\nPenang-Madras,...............1,280\r\nMadras-Bombay,.................650\r\nBombay-Aden,.................1,662\r\nAden-Suez,...................1,346\r\nSuez-Alexandria,...............224\r\nAlexandria-Malta,..............828\r\nMalta-Gibraltar,.............1,008\r\nGibraltar-Falmouth,..........1,061\r\nFalmouth-London,...............350\r\nLondon-New York,.............2,500\r\nNew York-San Francisco,......3,500\r\n\r\n\r\nI was in Adelaide again, some months later, and saw the multitudes gather\r\nin the neighboring city of Glenelg to commemorate the Reading of the\r\nProclamation--in 1836--which founded the Province.  If I have at any time\r\ncalled it a Colony, I withdraw the discourtesy.  It is not a Colony, it\r\nis a Province; and officially so.  Moreover, it is the only one so named\r\nin Australasia.  There was great enthusiasm; it was the Province's\r\nnational holiday, its Fourth of July, so to speak.  It is the pre-eminent\r\nholiday; and that is saying much, in a country where they seem to have a\r\nmost un-English mania for holidays.  Mainly they are workingmen's\r\nholidays; for in South Australia the workingman is sovereign; his vote is\r\nthe desire of the politician--indeed, it is the very breath of the\r\npolitician's being; the parliament exists to deliver the will of the\r\nworkingman, and the government exists to execute it.  The workingman is a\r\ngreat power everywhere in Australia, but South Australia is his paradise.\r\nHe has had a hard time in this world, and has earned a paradise.  I am\r\nglad he has found it.  The holidays there are frequent enough to be\r\nbewildering to the stranger.  I tried to get the hang of the system, but\r\nwas not able to do it.\r\n\r\nYou have seen that the Province is tolerant, religious-wise.  It is so\r\npolitically, also.  One of the speakers at the Commemoration banquet--the\r\nMinister of Public Works-was an American, born and reared in New England.\r\nThere is nothing narrow about the Province, politically, or in any other\r\nway that I know of.  Sixty-four religions and a Yankee cabinet minister.\r\nNo amount of horse-racing can damn this community.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of the Province is 62 deg.  The death-rate is 13 in\r\nthe 1,000--about half what it is in the city of New York, I should think,\r\nand New York is a healthy city.  Thirteen is the death-rate for the\r\naverage citizen of the Province, but there seems to be no death-rate for\r\nthe old people.  There were people at the Commemoration banquet who could\r\nremember Cromwell.  There were six of them.  These Old Settlers had all\r\nbeen present at the original Reading of the Proclamation, in 1836.  They\r\nshowed signs of the blightings and blastings of time, in their outward\r\naspect, but they were young within; young and cheerful, and ready to\r\ntalk; ready to talk, and talk all you wanted; in their turn, and out of\r\nit.  They were down for six speeches, and they made 42.  The governor and\r\nthe cabinet and the mayor were down for 42 speeches, and they made 6.\r\nThey have splendid grit, the Old Settlers, splendid staying power.  But\r\nthey do not hear well, and when they see the mayor going through motions\r\nwhich they recognize as the introducing of a speaker, they think they are\r\nthe one, and they all get up together, and begin to respond, in the most\r\nanimated way; and the more the mayor gesticulates, and shouts \xe2\x80\x9cSit down!\r\nSit down!\xe2\x80\x9d the more they take it for applause, and the more excited and\r\nreminiscent and enthusiastic they get; and next, when they see the whole\r\nhouse laughing and crying, three of them think it is about the bitter\r\nold-time hardships they are describing, and the other three think the\r\nlaughter is caused by the jokes they have been uncorking--jokes of the\r\nvintage of 1836--and then the way they do go on!  And finally when ushers\r\ncome and plead, and beg, and gently and reverently crowd them down into\r\ntheir seats, they say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, I'm not tired--I could bang along a week!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and they sit there looking simple and childlike, and gentle, and proud of\r\ntheir oratory, and wholly unconscious of what is going on at the other\r\nend of the room.  And so one of the great dignitaries gets a chance, and\r\nbegins his carefully prepared speech, impressively and with solemnity--\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we, now great and prosperous and powerful, bow our heads in\r\n     reverent wonder in the contemplation of those sublimities of energy,\r\n     of wisdom, of forethought, of----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUp come the immortal six again, in a body, with a joyous \xe2\x80\x9cHey, I've\r\nthought of another one!\xe2\x80\x9d and at it they go, with might and main, hearing\r\nnot a whisper of the pandemonium that salutes them, but taking all the\r\nvisible violences for applause, as before, and hammering joyously away\r\ntill the imploring ushers pray them into their seats again.  And a pity,\r\ntoo; for those lovely old boys did so enjoy living their heroic youth\r\nover, in these days of their honored antiquity; and certainly the things\r\nthey had to tell were usually worth the telling and the hearing.\r\n\r\nIt was a stirring spectacle; stirring in more ways than one, for it was\r\namazingly funny, and at the same time deeply pathetic; for they had seen\r\nso much, these time-worn veterans, and had suffered so much; and had\r\nbuilt so strongly and well, and laid the foundations of their\r\ncommonwealth so deep, in liberty and tolerance; and had lived to see the\r\nstructure rise to such state and dignity and hear themselves so praised\r\nfor their honorable work.\r\n\r\nOne of these old gentlemen told me some things of interest afterward;\r\nthings about the aboriginals, mainly.  He thought them intelligent\r\n--remarkably so in some directions--and he said that along with their\r\nunpleasant qualities they had some exceedingly good ones; and he\r\nconsidered it a great pity that the race had died out.  He instanced\r\ntheir invention of the boomerang and the \xe2\x80\x9cweet-weet\xe2\x80\x9d as evidences of\r\ntheir brightness; and as another evidence of it he said he had never seen\r\na white man who had cleverness enough to learn to do the miracles with\r\nthose two toys that the aboriginals achieved.  He said that even the\r\nsmartest whites had been obliged to confess that they could not learn the\r\ntrick of the boomerang in perfection; that it had possibilities which\r\nthey could not master.  The white man could not control its motions,\r\ncould not make it obey him; but the aboriginal could.  He told me some\r\nwonderful things--some almost incredible things--which he had seen the\r\nblacks do with the boomerang and the weet-weet.  They have been confirmed\r\nto me since by other early settlers and by trustworthy books.\r\n\r\nIt is contended--and may be said to be conceded--that the boomerang was\r\nknown to certain savage tribes in Europe in Roman times.  In support of\r\nthis, Virgil and two other Roman poets are quoted.  It is also contended\r\nthat it was known to the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\nOne of two things is then apparent, either some one with a boomerang\r\narrived in Australia in the days of antiquity before European knowledge\r\nof the thing had been lost, or the Australian aboriginal reinvented it.\r\nIt will take some time to find out which of these two propositions is the\r\nfact.  But there is no hurry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nIt is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three\r\nunspeakably precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience,\r\nand the prudence never to practice either of them.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nFrom diary:\r\n\r\nMr. G.  called.  I had not seen him since Nauheim, Germany--several years\r\nago; the time that the cholera broke out at Hamburg.  We talked of the\r\npeople we had known there, or had casually met; and G. said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember my introducing you to an earl--the Earl of C.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  That was the last time I saw you.  You and he were in a carriage,\r\njust starting--belated--for the train.  I remember it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it too, because of a thing which happened then which I was\r\nnot looking for.  He had told me a while before, about a remarkable and\r\ninteresting Californian whom he had met and who was a friend of yours,\r\nand said that if he should ever meet you he would ask you for some\r\nparticulars about that Californian.  The subject was not mentioned that\r\nday at Nauheim, for we were hurrying away, and there was no time; but the\r\nthing that surprised me was this: when I introduced you, you said, 'I am\r\nglad to meet your lordship--again.'  The 'again' was the surprise.  He is\r\na little hard of hearing, and didn't catch that word, and I thought you\r\nhadn't intended that he should.  As we drove off I had only time to say,\r\n'Why, what do you know about him?' and I understood you to say, 'Oh,\r\nnothing, except that he is the quickest judge of----'  Then we were gone,\r\nand I didn't get the rest.  I wondered what it was that he was such a\r\nquick judge of.  I have thought of it many times since, and still\r\nwondered what it could be.  He and I talked it over, but could not guess\r\nit out.  He thought it must be fox-hounds or horses, for he is a good\r\njudge of those--no one is a better.  But you couldn't know that, because\r\nyou didn't know him; you had mistaken him for some one else; it must be\r\nthat, he said, because he knew you had never met him before.  And of\r\ncourse you hadn't had you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that so?  Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt a fox-hunt, in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow curious that is.  Why, he hadn't the least recollection of it.  Had\r\nyou any conversation with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome--yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it left not the least impression upon him.  What did you talk\r\nabout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbout the fox.  I think that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that would interest him; that ought to have left an impression.\r\nWhat did he talk about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe fox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt's very curious.  I don't understand it.  Did what he said leave an\r\nimpression upon you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  It showed me that he was a quick judge of--however, I will tell\r\nyou all about it, then you will understand.  It was a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago 1873 or '74.  I had an American friend in London named F.,\r\nwho was fond of hunting, and his friends the Blanks invited him and me to\r\ncome out to a hunt and be their guests at their country place.  In the\r\nmorning the mounts were provided, but when I saw the horses I changed my\r\nmind and asked permission to walk.  I had never seen an English hunter\r\nbefore, and it seemed to me that I could hunt a fox safer on the ground.\r\nI had always been diffident about horses, anyway, even those of the\r\ncommon altitudes, and I did not feel competent to hunt on a horse that\r\nwent on stilts.  So then Mrs. Blank came to my help and said I could go\r\nwith her in the dog-cart and we would drive to a place she knew of, and\r\nthere we should have a good glimpse of the hunt as it went by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we got to that place I got out and went and leaned my elbows on a\r\nlow stone wall which enclosed a turfy and beautiful great field with\r\nheavy wood on all its sides except ours.  Mrs. Blank sat in the dog-cart\r\nfifty yards away, which was as near as she could get with the vehicle.\r\nI was full of interest, for I had never seen a fox-hunt.  I waited,\r\ndreaming and imagining, in the deep stillness and impressive tranquility\r\nwhich reigned in that retired spot.  Presently, from away off in the\r\nforest on the left, a mellow bugle-note came floating; then all of a\r\nsudden a multitude of dogs burst out of that forest and went tearing by\r\nand disappeared in the forest on the right; there was a pause, and then\r\na cloud of horsemen in black caps and crimson coats plunged out of the\r\nleft-hand forest and went flaming across the field like a prairie-fire,\r\na stirring sight to see.  There was one man ahead of the rest, and he\r\ncame spurring straight at me.  He was fiercely excited.  It was fine to\r\nsee him ride; he was a master horseman.  He came like a storm till he\r\nwas within seven feet of me, where I was leaning on the wall, then he\r\nstood his horse straight up in the air on his hind toe-nails, and shouted\r\nlike a demon:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Which way'd the fox go?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn't much like the tone, but I did not let on; for he was excited,\r\nyou know.  But I was calm; so I said softly, and without acrimony:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Which fox?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to anger him.  I don't know why; and he thundered out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'WHICH fox?  Why, THE fox?  Which way did the FOX go?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said, with great gentleness--even argumentatively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'If you could be a little more definite--a little less vague--because I\r\nam a stranger, and there are many foxes, as you will know even better\r\nthan I, and unless I know which one it is that you desire to identify,\r\nand----'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'You're certainly the damdest idiot that has escaped in a thousand\r\nyears!' and he snatched his great horse around as easily as I would\r\nsnatch a cat, and was away like a hurricane.  A very excitable man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went back to Mrs. Blank, and she was excited, too--oh, all alive.  She\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'He spoke to you!--didn't he?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Yes, it is what happened.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'I knew it! I couldn't hear what he said, but I knew he spoke to you! Do\r\nyou know who it was?  It was Lord C., and he is Master of the Buckhounds!\r\nTell me--what do you think of him?'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Him?  Well, for sizing-up a stranger, he's got the most sudden and\r\naccurate judgment of any man I ever saw.'\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt pleased her.  I thought it would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nG. got away from Nauheim just in time to escape being shut in by the\r\nquarantine-bars on the frontiers; and so did we, for we left the next\r\nday.  But G. had a great deal of trouble in getting by the Italian\r\ncustom-house, and we should have fared likewise but for the\r\nthoughtfulness of our consul-general in Frankfort.  He introduced me to\r\nthe Italian consul-general, and I brought away from that consulate a\r\nletter which made our way smooth.  It was a dozen lines merely commending\r\nme in a general way to the courtesies of servants in his Italian\r\nMajesty's service, but it was more powerful than it looked.  In addition\r\nto a raft of ordinary baggage, we had six or eight trunks which were\r\nfilled exclusively with dutiable stuff--household goods purchased in\r\nFrankfort for use in Florence, where we had taken a house.  I was going\r\nto ship these through by express; but at the last moment an order went\r\nthroughout Germany forbidding the moving of any parcels by train unless\r\nthe owner went with them.  This was a bad outlook.  We must take these\r\nthings along, and the delay sure to be caused by the examination of them\r\nin the custom-house might lose us our train.  I imagined all sorts of\r\nterrors, and enlarged them steadily as we approached the Italian\r\nfrontier.  We were six in number, clogged with all that baggage, and I\r\nwas courier for the party--the most incapable one they ever employed.\r\n\r\nWe arrived, and pressed with the crowd into the immense custom-house, and\r\nthe usual worries began; everybody crowding to the counter and begging to\r\nhave his baggage examined first, and all hands clattering and chattering\r\nat once.  It seemed to me that I could do nothing; it would be better to\r\ngive it all up and go away and leave the baggage.  I couldn't speak the\r\nlanguage; I should never accomplish anything.  Just then a tall handsome\r\nman in a fine uniform was passing by and I knew he must be the\r\nstation-master--and that reminded me of my letter.  I ran to him and put\r\nit into his hands.  He took it out of the envelope, and the moment his\r\neye caught the royal coat of arms printed at its top, he took off his cap\r\nand made a beautiful bow to me, and said in English:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich is your baggage?  Please show it to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI showed him the mountain.  Nobody was disturbing it; nobody was\r\ninterested in it; all the family's attempts to get attention to it had\r\nfailed--except in the case of one of the trunks containing the dutiable\r\ngoods.  It was just being opened.  My officer said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, let that alone! Lock it.  Now chalk it.  Chalk all of the lot.\r\nNow please come and show me the hand-baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe plowed through the waiting crowd, I following, to the counter, and he\r\ngave orders again, in his emphatic military way:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChalk these.  Chalk all of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he took off his cap and made that beautiful bow again, and went his\r\nway.  By this time these attentions had attracted the wonder of that acre\r\nof passengers, and the whisper had gone around that the royal family were\r\npresent getting their baggage chalked; and as we passed down in review on\r\nour way to the door, I was conscious of a pervading atmosphere of envy\r\nwhich gave me deep satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBut soon there was an accident.  My overcoat pockets were stuffed with\r\nGerman cigars and linen packages of American smoking tobacco, and a\r\nporter was following us around with this overcoat on his arm, and\r\ngradually getting it upside down.  Just as I, in the rear of my family,\r\nmoved by the sentinels at the door, about three hatfuls of the tobacco\r\ntumbled out on the floor.  One of the soldiers pounced upon it, gathered\r\nit up in his arms, pointed back whence I had come, and marched me ahead\r\nof him past that long wall of passengers again--he chattering and\r\nexulting like a devil, they smiling in peaceful joy, and I trying to look\r\nas if my pride was not hurt, and as if I did not mind being brought to\r\nshame before these pleased people who had so lately envied me.  But at\r\nheart I was cruelly humbled.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been marched two-thirds of the long distance and the misery of\r\nit was at the worst, the stately station-master stepped out from\r\nsomewhere, and the soldier left me and darted after him and overtook him;\r\nand I could see by the soldier's excited gestures that he was betraying\r\nto him the whole shabby business.  The station-master was plainly very\r\nangry.  He came striding down toward me, and when he was come near he\r\nbegan to pour out a stream of indignant Italian; then suddenly took off\r\nhis hat and made that beautiful bow and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, it is you! I beg a thousands pardons!  This idiot here---\xe2\x80\x9d He turned\r\nto the exulting soldier and burst out with a flood of white-hot Italian\r\nlava, and the next moment he was bowing, and the soldier and I were\r\nmoving in procession again--he in the lead and ashamed, this time, I with\r\nmy chin up.  And so we marched by the crowd of fascinated passengers, and\r\nI went forth to the train with the honors of war.  Tobacco and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMan will do many things to get himself loved, he will do all things to\r\nget himself envied.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nBefore I saw Australia I had never heard of the \xe2\x80\x9cweet-weet\xe2\x80\x9d at all.\r\nI met but few men who had seen it thrown--at least I met but few who\r\nmentioned having seen it thrown.  Roughly described, it is a fat wooden\r\ncigar with its butt-end fastened to a flexible twig.  The whole thing is\r\nonly a couple of feet long, and weighs less than two ounces.  This\r\nfeather--so to call it--is not thrown through the air, but is flung with\r\nan underhanded throw and made to strike the ground a little way in front\r\nof the thrower; then it glances and makes a long skip; glances again,\r\nskips again, and again and again, like the flat stone which a boy sends\r\nskating over the water.  The water is smooth, and the stone has a good\r\nchance; so a strong man may make it travel fifty or seventy-five yards;\r\nbut the weet-weet has no such good chance, for it strikes sand, grass,\r\nand earth in its course.  Yet an expert aboriginal has sent it a measured\r\ndistance of two hundred and twenty yards.  It would have gone even\r\nfurther but it encountered rank ferns and underwood on its passage and\r\nthey damaged its speed.  Two hundred and twenty yards; and so weightless\r\na toy--a mouse on the end of a bit of wire, in effect; and not sailing\r\nthrough the accommodating air, but encountering grass and sand and stuff\r\nat every jump.  It looks wholly impossible; but Mr. Brough Smyth saw the\r\nfeat and did the measuring, and set down the facts in his book about\r\naboriginal life, which he wrote by command of the Victorian Government.\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret of the feat?  No one explains.  It cannot be physical\r\nstrength, for that could not drive such a feather-weight any distance.\r\nIt must be art.  But no one explains what the art of it is; nor how it\r\ngets around that law of nature which says you shall not throw any\r\ntwo-ounce thing 220 yards, either through the air or bumping along the\r\nground.  Rev. J. G. Woods says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe distance to which the weet-weet or kangaroo-rat can be thrown is\r\ntruly astonishing.  I have seen an Australian stand at one side of\r\nKennington Oval and throw the kangaroo rat completely across it.\xe2\x80\x9d (Width\r\nof Kennington Oval not stated.)  \xe2\x80\x9cIt darts through the air with the sharp\r\nand menacing hiss of a rifle-ball, its greatest height from the ground\r\nbeing some seven or eight feet .  .  .  .  .  .  When properly thrown it\r\nlooks just like a living animal leaping along .  .  .  .  .  .  Its\r\nmovements have a wonderful resemblance to the long leaps of a\r\nkangaroo-rat fleeing in alarm, with its long tail trailing behind it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Old Settler said that he had seen distances made by the weet-weet, in\r\nthe early days, which almost convinced him that it was as extraordinary\r\nan instrument as the boomerang.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a large distribution of acuteness among those naked\r\nskinny aboriginals, or they couldn't have been such unapproachable\r\ntrackers and boomerangers and weet-weeters.  It must have been\r\nrace-aversion that put upon them a good deal of the low-rate intellectual\r\nreputation which they bear and have borne this long time in the world's\r\nestimate of them.\r\n\r\nThey were lazy--always lazy.  Perhaps that was their trouble.  It is a\r\nkilling defect.  Surely they could have invented and built a competent\r\nhouse, but they didn't.  And they could have invented and developed the\r\nagricultural arts, but they didn't.  They went naked and houseless, and\r\nlived on fish and grubs and worms and wild fruits, and were just plain\r\nsavages, for all their smartness.\r\n\r\nWith a country as big as the United States to live and multiply in, and\r\nwith no epidemic diseases among them till the white man came with those\r\nand his other appliances of civilization, it is quite probable that there\r\nwas never a day in his history when he could muster 100,000 of his race\r\nin all Australia.  He diligently and deliberately kept population down by\r\ninfanticide--largely; but mainly by certain other methods.  He did not\r\nneed to practise these artificialities any more after the white man came.\r\nThe white man knew ways of keeping down population which were worth\r\nseveral of his.  The white man knew ways of reducing a native population\r\n80 percent. in 20 years.  The native had never seen anything as fine as\r\nthat before.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is the case of the country now called Victoria--a\r\ncountry eighty times as large as Rhode Island, as I have already said.\r\nBy the best official guess there were 4,500 aboriginals in it when the\r\nwhites came along in the middle of the 'Thirties.  Of these, 1,000 lived\r\nin Gippsland, a patch of territory the size of fifteen or sixteen Rhode\r\nIslands: they did not diminish as fast as some of the other communities;\r\nindeed, at the end of forty years there were still 200 of them left.  The\r\nGeelong tribe diminished more satisfactorily: from 173 persons it faded\r\nto 34 in twenty years; at the end of another twenty the tribe numbered\r\none person altogether.  The two Melbourne tribes could muster almost 300\r\nwhen the white man came; they could muster but twenty, thirty-seven years\r\nlater, in 1875.  In that year there were still odds and ends of tribes\r\nscattered about the colony of Victoria, but I was told that natives of\r\nfull blood are very scarce now.  It is said that the aboriginals continue\r\nin some force in the huge territory called Queensland.\r\n\r\nThe early whites were not used to savages.  They could not understand the\r\nprimary law of savage life: that if a man do you a wrong, his whole tribe\r\nis responsible--each individual of it--and you may take your change out\r\nof any individual of it, without bothering to seek out the guilty one.\r\nWhen a white killed an aboriginal, the tribe applied the ancient law, and\r\nkilled the first white they came across.  To the whites this was a\r\nmonstrous thing.  Extermination seemed to be the proper medicine for such\r\ncreatures as this.  They did not kill all the blacks, but they promptly\r\nkilled enough of them to make their own persons safe.  From the dawn of\r\ncivilization down to this day the white man has always used that very\r\nprecaution.  Mrs. Campbell Praed lived in Queensland, as a child, in the\r\nearly days, and in her \xe2\x80\x9cSketches of Australian life,\xe2\x80\x9d we get informing\r\npictures of the early struggles of the white and the black to reform each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of pioneer days in the mighty wilderness of Queensland, Mrs.\r\nPraed says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt first the natives retreated before the whites; and, except that\r\n     they every now and then speared a beast in one of the herds, gave\r\n     little cause for uneasiness.  But, as the number of squatters\r\n     increased, each one taking up miles of country and bringing two or\r\n     three men in his train, so that shepherds' huts and stockmen's camps\r\n     lay far apart, and defenseless in the midst of hostile tribes, the\r\n     Blacks' depredations became more frequent and murder was no unusual\r\n     event.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe loneliness of the Australian bush can hardly be painted in\r\n     words.  Here extends mile after mile of primeval forest where\r\n     perhaps foot of white man has never trod--interminable vistas where\r\n     the eucalyptus trees rear their lofty trunks and spread forth their\r\n     lanky limbs, from which the red gum oozes and hangs in fantastic\r\n     pendants like crimson stalactites; ravines along the sides of which\r\n     the long-bladed grass grows rankly; level untimbered plains\r\n     alternating with undulating tracts of pasture, here and there broken\r\n     by a stony ridge, steep gully, or dried-up creek.  All wild, vast\r\n     and desolate; all the same monotonous gray coloring, except where\r\n     the wattle, when in blossom, shows patches of feathery gold, or a\r\n     belt of scrub lies green, glossy, and impenetrable as Indian jungle.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe solitude seems intensified by the strange sounds of reptiles,\r\n     birds, and insects, and by the absence of larger creatures; of which\r\n     in the day-time, the only audible signs are the stampede of a herd\r\n     of kangaroo, or the rustle of a wallabi, or a dingo stirring the\r\n     grass as it creeps to its lair.  But there are the whirring of\r\n     locusts, the demoniac chuckle of the laughing jack-ass, the\r\n     screeching of cockatoos and parrots, the hissing of the frilled\r\n     lizard, and the buzzing of innumerable insects hidden under the\r\n     dense undergrowth. And then at night, the melancholy wailing of the\r\n     curlews, the dismal howling of dingoes, the discordant croaking of\r\n     tree-frogs, might well shake the nerves of the solitary watcher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is the theater for the drama.  When you comprehend one or two other\r\ndetails, you will perceive how well suited for trouble it was, and how\r\nloudly it invited it.  The cattlemen's stations were scattered over that\r\nprofound wilderness miles and miles apart--at each station half a dozen\r\npersons.  There was a plenty of cattle, the black natives were always\r\nill-nourished and hungry.  The land belonged to them.  The whites had not\r\nbought it, and couldn't buy it; for the tribes had no chiefs, nobody in\r\nauthority, nobody competent to sell and convey; and the tribes themselves\r\nhad no comprehension of the idea of transferable ownership of land.  The\r\nousted owners were despised by the white interlopers, and this opinion\r\nwas not hidden under a bushel.  More promising materials for a tragedy\r\ncould not have been collated.  Let Mrs. Praed speak:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt Nie Nie station, one dark night, the unsuspecting hut-keeper,\r\n     having, as he believed, secured himself against assault, was lying\r\n     wrapped in his blankets sleeping profoundly.  The Blacks crept\r\n     stealthily down the chimney and battered in his skull while he\r\n     slept.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne could guess the whole drama from that little text.  The curtain was\r\nup.  It would not fall until the mastership of one party or the other was\r\ndetermined--and permanently:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThere was treachery on both sides.  The Blacks killed the Whites\r\n     when they found them defenseless, and the Whites slew the Blacks in\r\n     a wholesale and promiscuous fashion which offended against my\r\n     childish sense of justice.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThey were regarded as little above the level of brutes, and in some\r\n     cases were destroyed like vermin.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHere is an instance.  A squatter, whose station was surrounded by\r\n     Blacks, whom he suspected to be hostile and from whom he feared an\r\n     attack, parleyed with them from his house-door.  He told them it was\r\n     Christmas-time--a time at which all men, black or white, feasted;\r\n     that there were flour, sugar-plums, good things in plenty in the\r\n     store, and that he would make for them such a pudding as they had\r\n     never dreamed of--a great pudding of which all might eat and be\r\n     filled.  The Blacks listened and were lost.  The pudding was made\r\n     and distributed.  Next morning there was howling in the camp, for it\r\n     had been sweetened with sugar and arsenic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe white man's spirit was right, but his method was wrong.  His spirit\r\nwas the spirit which the civilized white has always exhibited toward the\r\nsavage, but the use of poison was a departure from custom.  True, it was\r\nmerely a technical departure, not a real one; still, it was a departure,\r\nand therefore a mistake, in my opinion.  It was better, kinder, swifter,\r\nand much more humane than a number of the methods which have been\r\nsanctified by custom, but that does not justify its employment.  That is,\r\nit does not wholly justify it.  Its unusual nature makes it stand out and\r\nattract an amount of attention which it is not entitled to.  It takes\r\nhold upon morbid imaginations and they work it up into a sort of\r\nexhibition of cruelty, and this smirches the good name of our\r\ncivilization, whereas one of the old harsher methods would have had no\r\nsuch effect because usage has made those methods familiar to us and\r\ninnocent.  In many countries we have chained the savage and starved him\r\nto death; and this we do not care for, because custom has inured us to\r\nit; yet a quick death by poison is lovingkindness to it.  In many\r\ncountries we have burned the savage at the stake; and this we do not care\r\nfor, because custom has inured us to it; yet a quick death is\r\nloving-kindness to it.  In more than one country we have hunted the\r\nsavage and his little children and their mother with dogs and guns\r\nthrough the woods and swamps for an afternoon's sport, and filled the\r\nregion with happy laughter over their sprawling and stumbling flight, and\r\ntheir wild supplications for mercy; but this method we do not mind,\r\nbecause custom has inured us to it; yet a quick death by poison is\r\nlovingkindness to it.  In many countries we have taken the savage's land\r\nfrom him, and made him our slave, and lashed him every day, and broken\r\nhis pride, and made death his only friend, and overworked him till he\r\ndropped in his tracks; and this we do not care for, because custom has\r\ninured us to it; yet a quick death by poison is lovingkindness to it.\r\nIn the Matabeleland today--why, there we are confining ourselves to\r\nsanctified custom, we Rhodes-Beit millionaires in South Africa and Dukes\r\nin London; and nobody cares, because we are used to the old holy customs,\r\nand all we ask is that no notice-inviting new ones shall be intruded upon\r\nthe attention of our comfortable consciences.  Mrs. Praed says of the\r\npoisoner, \xe2\x80\x9cThat squatter deserves to have his name handed down to the\r\ncontempt of posterity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear her say that.  I myself blame him for one thing, and\r\nseverely, but I stop there.  I blame him for, the indiscretion of\r\nintroducing a novelty which was calculated to attract attention to our\r\ncivilization.  There was no occasion to do that.  It was his duty, and it\r\nis every loyal man's duty to protect that heritage in every way he can;\r\nand the best way to do that is to attract attention elsewhere.  The\r\nsquatter's judgment was bad--that is plain; but his heart was right.  He\r\nis almost the only pioneering representative of civilization in history\r\nwho has risen above the prejudices of his caste and his heredity and\r\ntried to introduce the element of mercy into the superior race's dealings\r\nwith the savage.  His name is lost, and it is a pity; for it deserves to\r\nbe handed down to posterity with homage and reverence.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph is from a London journal:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cTo learn what France is doing to spread the blessings of\r\n     civilization in her distant dependencies we may turn with advantage\r\n     to New Caledonia.  With a view to attracting free settlers to that\r\n     penal colony, M. Feillet, the Governor, forcibly expropriated the\r\n     Kanaka cultivators from the best of their plantations, with a\r\n     derisory compensation, in spite of the protests of the Council\r\n     General of the island.  Such immigrants as could be induced to cross\r\n     the seas thus found themselves in possession of thousands of coffee,\r\n     cocoa, banana, and bread-fruit trees, the raising of which had cost\r\n     the wretched natives years of toil whilst the latter had a few\r\n     five-franc pieces to spend in the liquor stores of Noumea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou observe the combination?  It is robbery, humiliation, and slow, slow\r\nmurder, through poverty and the white man's whisky.  The savage's gentle\r\nfriend, the savage's noble friend, the only magnanimous and unselfish\r\nfriend the savage has ever had, was not there with the merciful swift\r\nrelease of his poisoned pudding.\r\n\r\nThere are many humorous things in the world; among them the white man's\r\nnotion that he is less savage than the other savages.--[See Chapter on\r\nTasmania, post.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nNothing is so ignorant as a man's left hand, except a lady's watch.\r\n\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nYou notice that Mrs. Praed knows her art.  She can place a thing before\r\nyou so that you can see it.  She is not alone in that.  Australia is\r\nfertile in writers whose books are faithful mirrors of the life of the\r\ncountry and of its history.  The materials were surprisingly rich, both\r\nin quality and in mass, and Marcus Clarke, Rolph Boldrewood, Gordon,\r\nKendall, and the others, have built out of them a brilliant and vigorous\r\nliterature, and one which must endure.  Materials--there is no end to\r\nthem!  Why, a literature might be made out of the aboriginal all by\r\nhimself, his character and ways are so freckled with varieties--varieties\r\nnot staled by familiarity, but new to us.  You do not need to invent any\r\npicturesquenesses; whatever you want in that line he can furnish you; and\r\nthey will not be fancies and doubtful, but realities and authentic.  In\r\nhis history, as preserved by the white man's official records, he is\r\neverything--everything that a human creature can be.  He covers the\r\nentire ground.  He is a coward--there are a thousand fact to prove it.\r\nHe is brave--there are a thousand facts to prove it.  He is treacherous\r\n--oh, beyond imagination! he is faithful, loyal, true--the white man's\r\nrecords supply you with a harvest of instances of it that are noble,\r\nworshipful, and pathetically beautiful.  He kills the starving stranger\r\nwho comes begging for food and shelter there is proof of it.  He succors,\r\nand feeds, and guides to safety, to-day, the lost stranger who fired on\r\nhim only yesterday--there is proof of it.  He takes his reluctant bride\r\nby force, he courts her with a club, then loves her faithfully through a\r\nlong life--it is of record.  He gathers to himself another wife by the\r\nsame processes, beats and bangs her as a daily diversion, and by and by\r\nlays down his life in defending her from some outside harm--it is of\r\nrecord.  He will face a hundred hostiles to rescue one of his children,\r\nand will kill another of his children because the family is large enough\r\nwithout it.  His delicate stomach turns, at certain details of the white\r\nman's food; but he likes over-ripe fish, and brazed dog, and cat, and\r\nrat, and will eat his own uncle with relish.  He is a sociable animal,\r\nyet he turns aside and hides behind his shield when his mother-in-law\r\ngoes by.  He is childishly afraid of ghosts and other trivialities that\r\nmenace his soul, but dread of physical pain is a weakness which he is not\r\nacquainted with.  He knows all the great and many of the little\r\nconstellations, and has names for them; he has a symbol-writing by means\r\nof which he can convey messages far and wide among the tribes; he has a\r\ncorrect eye for form and expression, and draws a good picture; he can\r\ntrack a fugitive by delicate traces which the white man's eye cannot\r\ndiscern, and by methods which the finest white intelligence cannot\r\nmaster; he makes a missile which science itself cannot duplicate without\r\nthe model--if with it; a missile whose secret baffled and defeated the\r\nsearchings and theorizings of the white mathematicians for seventy years;\r\nand by an art all his own he performs miracles with it which the white\r\nman cannot approach untaught, nor parallel after teaching.  Within\r\ncertain limits this savage's intellect is the alertest and the brightest\r\nknown to history or tradition; and yet the poor creature was never able\r\nto invent a counting system that would reach above five, nor a vessel\r\nthat he could boil water in.  He is the prize-curiosity of all the races.\r\nTo all intents and purposes he is dead--in the body; but he has features\r\nthat will live in literature.\r\n\r\nMr. Philip Chauncy, an officer of the Victorian Government, contributed\r\nto its archives a report of his personal observations of the aboriginals\r\nwhich has in it some things which I wish to condense slightly and insert\r\nhere.  He speaks of the quickness of their eyes and the accuracy of their\r\njudgment of the direction of approaching missiles as being quite\r\nextraordinary, and of the answering suppleness and accuracy of limb and\r\nmuscle in avoiding the missile as being extraordinary also.  He has seen\r\nan aboriginal stand as a target for cricket-balls thrown with great force\r\nten or fifteen yards, by professional bowlers, and successfully dodge\r\nthem or parry them with his shield during about half an hour.  One of\r\nthose balls, properly placed, could have killed him; \xe2\x80\x9cYet he depended,\r\nwith the utmost self-possession, on the quickness of his eye and his\r\nagility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe shield was the customary war-shield of his race, and would not be a\r\nprotection to you or to me.  It is no broader than a stovepipe, and is\r\nabout as long as a man's arm.  The opposing surface is not flat, but\r\nslopes away from the centerline like a boat's bow.  The difficulty about\r\na cricket-ball that has been thrown with a scientific \xe2\x80\x9ctwist\xe2\x80\x9d is, that it\r\nsuddenly changes its course when it is close to its target and comes\r\nstraight for the mark when apparently it was going overhead or to one\r\nside.  I should not be able to protect myself from such balls for\r\nhalf-an-hour, or less.\r\n\r\nMr. Chauncy once saw \xe2\x80\x9ca little native man\xe2\x80\x9d throw a cricket-ball 119\r\nyards.  This is said to beat the English professional record by thirteen\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nWe have all seen the circus-man bound into the air from a spring-board\r\nand make a somersault over eight horses standing side by side.  Mr.\r\nChauncy saw an aboriginal do it over eleven; and was assured that he had\r\nsometimes done it over fourteen.  But what is that to this:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI saw the same man leap from the ground, and in going over he\r\n     dipped his head, unaided by his hands, into a hat placed in an\r\n     inverted position on the top of the head of another man sitting\r\n     upright on horseback--both man and horse being of the average size.\r\n     The native landed on the other side of the horse with the hat fairly\r\n     on his head.  The prodigious height of the leap, and the precision\r\n     with which it was taken so as to enable him to dip his head into the\r\n     hat, exceeded any feat of the kind I have ever beheld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should think so!  On board a ship lately I saw a young Oxford athlete\r\nrun four steps and spring into the air and squirm his hips by a\r\nside-twist over a bar that was five and one-half feet high; but he could\r\nnot have stood still and cleared a bar that was four feet high.  I know\r\nthis, because I tried it myself.\r\n\r\nOne can see now where the kangaroo learned its art.\r\n\r\nSir George Grey and Mr. Eyre testify that the natives dug wells fourteen\r\nor fifteen feet deep and two feet in diameter at the bore--dug them in\r\nthe sand--wells that were \xe2\x80\x9cquite circular, carried straight down, and the\r\nwork beautifully executed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTheir tools were their hands and feet.  How did they throw sand out from\r\nsuch a depth?  How could they stoop down and get it, with only two feet\r\nof space to stoop in?  How did they keep that sand-pipe from caving in\r\non them?  I do not know.  Still, they did manage those seeming\r\nimpossibilities.  Swallowed the sand, may be.\r\n\r\nMr. Chauncy speaks highly of the patience and skill and alert\r\nintelligence of the native huntsman when he is stalking the emu, the\r\nkangaroo, and other game:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAs he walks through the bush his step is light, elastic, and\r\n     noiseless; every track on the earth catches his keen eye; a leaf, or\r\n     fragment of a stick turned, or a blade of grass recently bent by the\r\n     tread of one of the lower animals, instantly arrests his attention;\r\n     in fact, nothing escapes his quick and powerful sight on the ground,\r\n     in the trees, or in the distance, which may supply him with a meal\r\n     or warn him of danger.  A little examination of the trunk of a tree\r\n     which may be nearly covered with the scratches of opossums ascending\r\n     and descending is sufficient to inform him whether one went up the\r\n     night before without coming down again or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFennimore Cooper lost his chance.  He would have known how to value these\r\npeople.  He wouldn't have traded the dullest of them for the brightest\r\nMohawk he ever invented.\r\n\r\nAll savages draw outline pictures upon bark; but the resemblances are not\r\nclose, and expression is usually lacking.  But the Australian\r\naboriginal's pictures of animals were nicely accurate in form, attitude,\r\ncarriage; and he put spirit into them, and expression.  And his pictures\r\nof white people and natives were pretty nearly as good as his pictures of\r\nthe other animals.  He dressed his whites in the fashion of their day,\r\nboth the ladies and the gentlemen.  As an untaught wielder of the pencil\r\nit is not likely that he has his equal among savage people.\r\n\r\nHis place in art--as to drawing, not color-work--is well up, all things\r\nconsidered.  His art is not to be classified with savage art at all, but\r\non a plane two degrees above it and one degree above the lowest plane of\r\ncivilized art.  To be exact, his place in art is between Botticelli and\r\nDe Maurier.  That is to say, he could not draw as well as De Maurier but\r\nbetter than Boticelli.  In feeling, he resembles both; also in grouping\r\nand in his preferences in the matter of subjects.  His \xe2\x80\x9ccorrobboree\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nthe Australian wilds reappears in De Maurier's Belgravian ballrooms, with\r\nclothes and the smirk of civilization added; Botticelli's \xe2\x80\x9cSpring\xe2\x80\x9d is the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccorrobboree\xe2\x80\x9d further idealized, but with fewer clothes and more smirk.\r\nAnd well enough as to intention, but--my word!\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal can make a fire by friction.  I have tried that.\r\n\r\nAll savages are able to stand a good deal of physical pain.  The\r\nAustralian aboriginal has this quality in a well-developed degree.  Do\r\nnot read the following instances if horrors are not pleasant to you.\r\nThey were recorded by the Rev. Henry N. Wolloston, of Melbourne, who had\r\nbeen a surgeon before he became a clergyman:\r\n\r\n     1.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn the summer of 1852 I started on horseback from Albany, King\r\n     George's Sound, to visit at Cape Riche, accompanied by a native on\r\n     foot.  We traveled about forty miles the first day, then camped by a\r\n     water-hole for the night.  After cooking and eating our supper, I\r\n     observed the native, who had said nothing to me on the subject,\r\n     collect the hot embers of the fire together, and deliberately place\r\n     his right foot in the glowing mass for a moment, then suddenly\r\n     withdraw it, stamping on the ground and uttering a long-drawn\r\n     guttural sound of mingled pain and satisfaction.  This operation he\r\n     repeated several times.  On my inquiring the meaning of his strange\r\n     conduct, he only said, 'Me carpenter-make 'em' ['I am mending my\r\n     foot'), and then showed me his charred great toe, the nail of which\r\n     had been torn off by a tea-tree stump, in which it had been caught\r\n     during the journey, and the pain of which he had borne with stoical\r\n     composure until the evening, when he had an opportunity of\r\n     cauterizing the wound in the primitive manner above described.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he proceeded on the journey the next day, \xe2\x80\x9cas if nothing had\r\nhappened\xe2\x80\x9d--and walked thirty miles.  It was a strange idea, to keep a\r\nsurgeon and then do his own surgery.\r\n\r\n     2.  \xe2\x80\x9cA native about twenty-five years of age once applied to me, as\r\n     a doctor, to extract the wooden barb of a spear, which, during a\r\n     fight in the bush some four months previously, had entered his\r\n     chest, just missing the heart, and penetrated the viscera to a\r\n     considerable depth.  The spear had been cut off, leaving the barb\r\n     behind, which continued to force its way by muscular action\r\n     gradually toward the back; and when I examined him I could feel a\r\n     hard substance between the ribs below the left blade-bone.  I made a\r\n     deep incision, and with a pair of forceps extracted the barb, which\r\n     was made, as usual, of hard wood about four inches long and from\r\n     half an inch to an inch thick.  It was very smooth, and partly\r\n     digested, so to speak, by the maceration to which it had been\r\n     exposed during its four months' journey through the body.  The wound\r\n     made by the spear had long since healed, leaving only a small\r\n     cicatrix; and after the operation, which the native bore without\r\n     flinching, he appeared to suffer no pain.  Indeed, judging from his\r\n     good state of health, the presence of the foreign matter did not\r\n     materially annoy him.  He was perfectly well in a few days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut No. 3 is my favorite.  Whenever I read it I seem to enjoy all that\r\nthe patient enjoyed--whatever it was:\r\n\r\n     3.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnce at King George's Sound a native presented himself to me\r\n     with one leg only, and requested me to supply him with a wooden leg.\r\n     He had traveled in this maimed state about ninety-six miles, for\r\n     this purpose.  I examined the limb, which had been severed just\r\n     below the knee, and found that it had been charred by fire, while\r\n     about two inches of the partially calcined bone protruded through\r\n     the flesh.  I at once removed this with the saw; and having made as\r\n     presentable a stump of it as I could, covered the amputated end of\r\n     the bone with a surrounding of muscle, and kept the patient a few\r\n     days under my care to allow the wound to heal.  On inquiring, the\r\n     native told me that in a fight with other black-fellows a spear had\r\n     struck his leg and penetrated the bone below the knee.  Finding it\r\n     was serious, he had recourse to the following crude and barbarous\r\n     operation, which it appears is not uncommon among these people in\r\n     their native state.  He made a fire, and dug a hole in the earth\r\n     only sufficiently large to admit his leg, and deep enough to allow\r\n     the wounded part to be on a level with the surface of the ground.\r\n     He then surrounded the limb with the live coals or charcoal, which\r\n     was replenished until the leg was literally burnt off.  The\r\n     cauterization thus applied completely checked the hemorrhage, and he\r\n     was able in a day or two to hobble down to the Sound, with the aid\r\n     of a long stout stick, although he was more than a week on the\r\n     road.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he was a fastidious native.  He soon discarded the wooden leg made\r\nfor him by the doctor, because \xe2\x80\x9cit had no feeling in it.\xe2\x80\x9d  It must have\r\nhad as much as the one he burnt off, I should think.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Aboriginals.  It is difficult for me to let them alone.\r\nThey are marvelously interesting creatures.  For a quarter of a century,\r\nnow, the several colonial governments have housed their remnants in\r\ncomfortable stations, and fed them well and taken good care of them in\r\nevery way.  If I had found this out while I was in Australia I could have\r\nseen some of those people--but I didn't.  I would walk thirty miles to\r\nsee a stuffed one.\r\n\r\nAustralia has a slang of its own.  This is a matter of course.  The vast\r\ncattle and sheep industries, the strange aspects of the country, and the\r\nstrange native animals, brute and human, are matters which would\r\nnaturally breed a local slang.  I have notes of this slang somewhere, but\r\nat the moment I can call to mind only a few of the words and phrases.\r\nThey are expressive ones.  The wide, sterile, unpeopled deserts have\r\ncreated eloquent phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cNo Man's Land\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cNever-never\r\nCountry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Also this felicitous form: \xe2\x80\x9cShe lives in the Never-never\r\nCountry\xe2\x80\x9d--that is, she is an old maid.  And this one is not without\r\nmerit: \xe2\x80\x9cheifer-paddock\xe2\x80\x9d--young ladies' seminary.  \xe2\x80\x9cBail up\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstick\r\nup\xe2\x80\x9d equivalent of our highwayman-term to \xe2\x80\x9chold up\xe2\x80\x9d a stage-coach or a\r\ntrain.  \xe2\x80\x9cNew-chum\xe2\x80\x9d is the equivalent of our \xe2\x80\x9ctenderfoot\xe2\x80\x9d--new arrival.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the immortal \xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d We must import it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM-y word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn cold print it is the equivalent of our \xe2\x80\x9cGer-rreat Caesar!\xe2\x80\x9d but spoken\r\nwith the proper Australian unction and fervency, it is worth six of it\r\nfor grace and charm and expressiveness.  Our form is rude and explosive;\r\nit is not suited to the drawing-room or the heifer-paddock; but \xe2\x80\x9cM-y\r\nword!\xe2\x80\x9d is, and is music to the ear, too, when the utterer knows how to\r\nsay it.  I saw it in print several times on the Pacific Ocean, but it\r\nstruck me coldly, it aroused no sympathy.  That was because it was the\r\ndead corpse of the thing, the soul was not there--the tones were\r\nlacking--the informing spirit--the deep feeling--the eloquence.  But the\r\nfirst time I heard an Australian say it, it was positively thrilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nBe careless in your dress if you must, but keep a tidy soul.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWe left Adelaide in due course, and went to Horsham, in the colony of\r\nVictoria; a good deal of a journey, if I remember rightly, but pleasant.\r\nHorsham sits in a plain which is as level as a floor--one of those famous\r\ndead levels which Australian books describe so often; gray, bare, sombre,\r\nmelancholy, baked, cracked, in the tedious long drouths, but a\r\nhorizonless ocean of vivid green grass the day after a rain.  A country\r\ntown, peaceful, reposeful, inviting, full of snug homes, with garden\r\nplots, and plenty of shrubbery and flowers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorsham, October 17.\r\nAt the hotel.  The weather divine.  Across the way, in front of the\r\nLondon Bank of Australia, is a very handsome cottonwood.  It is in\r\nopulent leaf, and every leaf perfect.  The full power of the on-rushing\r\nspring is upon it, and I imagine I can see it grow.  Alongside the bank\r\nand a little way back in the garden there is a row of soaring\r\nfountain-sprays of delicate feathery foliage quivering in the breeze, and\r\nmottled with flashes of light that shift and play through the mass like\r\nflash-lights through an opal--a most beautiful tree, and a striking\r\ncontrast to the cottonwood.  Every leaf of the cottonwood is distinctly\r\ndefined--it is a kodak for faithful, hard, unsentimental detail; the\r\nother an impressionist picture, delicious to look upon, full of a subtle\r\nand exquisite charm, but all details fused in a swoon of vague and soft\r\nloveliness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt turned out, upon inquiry, to be a pepper tree--an importation from\r\nChina.  It has a silky sheen, soft and rich.  I saw some that had long\r\nred bunches of currant-like berries ambushed among the foliage.  At a\r\ndistance, in certain lights, they give the tree a pinkish tint and a new\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\nThere is an agricultural college eight miles from Horsham.  We were\r\ndriven out to it by its chief.  The conveyance was an open wagon; the\r\ntime, noonday; no wind; the sky without a cloud, the sunshine brilliant\r\n--and the mercury at 92 deg. in the shade.  In some countries an indolent\r\nunsheltered drive of an hour and a half under such conditions would have\r\nbeen a sweltering and prostrating experience; but there was nothing of\r\nthat in this case.  It is a climate that is perfect.  There was no sense\r\nof heat; indeed, there was no heat; the air was fine and pure and\r\nexhilarating; if the drive had lasted half a day I think we should not\r\nhave felt any discomfort, or grown silent or droopy or tired.  Of course,\r\nthe secret of it was the exceeding dryness of the atmosphere.  In that\r\nplain 112 deg. in the shade is without doubt no harder upon a man than is\r\n88 or 90 deg. in New York.\r\n\r\nThe road lay through the middle of an empty space which seemed to me to\r\nbe a hundred yards wide between the fences.  I was not given the width in\r\nyards, but only in chains and perches--and furlongs, I think.  I would\r\nhave given a good deal to know what the width was, but I did not pursue\r\nthe matter.  I think it is best to put up with information the way you\r\nget it; and seem satisfied with it, and surprised at it, and grateful for\r\nit, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy word!\xe2\x80\x9d and never let on.  It was a wide space; I could\r\ntell you how wide, in chains and perches and furlongs and things, but\r\nthat would not help you any.  Those things sound well, but they are\r\nshadowy and indefinite, like troy weight and avoirdupois; nobody knows\r\nwhat they mean.  When you buy a pound of a drug and the man asks you\r\nwhich you want, troy or avoirdupois, it is best to say \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d and shift\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThey said that the wide space dates from the earliest sheep and\r\ncattle-raising days.  People had to drive their stock long distances\r\n--immense journeys--from worn-out places to new ones where were water\r\nand fresh pasturage; and this wide space had to be left in grass and\r\nunfenced, or the stock would have starved to death in the transit.\r\n\r\nOn the way we saw the usual birds--the beautiful little green parrots,\r\nthe magpie, and some others; and also the slender native bird of modest\r\nplumage and the eternally-forgettable name--the bird that is the smartest\r\namong birds, and can give a parrot 30 to 1 in the game and then talk him\r\nto death.  I cannot recall that bird's name.  I think it begins with M.\r\nI wish it began with G. or something that a person can remember.\r\n\r\nThe magpie was out in great force, in the fields and on the fences.  He\r\nis a handsome large creature, with snowy white decorations, and is a\r\nsinger; he has a murmurous rich note that is lovely.  He was once modest,\r\neven diffident; but he lost all that when he found out that he was\r\nAustralia's sole musical bird.  He has talent, and cuteness, and\r\nimpudence; and in his tame state he is a most satisfactory pet--never\r\ncoming when he is called, always coming when he isn't, and studying\r\ndisobedience as an accomplishment.  He is not confined, but loafs all\r\nover the house and grounds, like the laughing jackass.  I think he learns\r\nto talk, I know he learns to sing tunes, and his friends say that he\r\nknows how to steal without learning.  I was acquainted with a tame magpie\r\nin Melbourne.  He had lived in a lady's house several years, and believed\r\nhe owned it.  The lady had tamed him, and in return he had tamed the\r\nlady.  He was always on deck when not wanted, always having his own way,\r\nalways tyrannizing over the dog, and always making the cat's life a slow\r\nsorrow and a martyrdom.  He knew a number of tunes and could sing them in\r\nperfect time and tune; and would do it, too, at any time that silence was\r\nwanted; and then encore himself and do it again; but if he was asked to\r\nsing he would go out and take a walk.\r\n\r\nIt was long believed that fruit trees would not grow in that baked and\r\nwaterless plain around Horsham, but the agricultural college has\r\ndissipated that idea.  Its ample nurseries were producing oranges,\r\napricots, lemons, almonds, peaches, cherries, 48 varieties of apples--in\r\nfact, all manner of fruits, and in abundance.  The trees did not seem to\r\nmiss the water; they were in vigorous and flourishing condition.\r\n\r\nExperiments are made with different soils, to see what things thrive best\r\nin them and what climates are best for them.  A man who is ignorantly\r\ntrying to produce upon his farm things not suited to its soil and its\r\nother conditions can make a journey to the college from anywhere in\r\nAustralia, and go back with a change of scheme which will make his farm\r\nproductive and profitable.\r\n\r\nThere were forty pupils there--a few of them farmers, relearning their\r\ntrade, the rest young men mainly from the cities--novices.  It seemed a\r\nstrange thing that an agricultural college should have an attraction for\r\ncity-bred youths, but such is the fact.  They are good stuff, too; they\r\nare above the agricultural average of intelligence, and they come without\r\nany inherited prejudices in favor of hoary ignorances made sacred by long\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nThe students work all day in the fields, the nurseries, and the\r\nshearing-sheds, learning and doing all the practical work of the\r\nbusiness--three days in a week.  On the other three they study and hear\r\nlectures.  They are taught the beginnings of such sciences as bear upon\r\nagriculture--like chemistry, for instance.  We saw the sophomore class in\r\nsheep-shearing shear a dozen sheep.  They did it by hand, not with the\r\nmachine.  The sheep was seized and flung down on his side and held there;\r\nand the students took off his coat with great celerity and adroitness.\r\nSometimes they clipped off a sample of the sheep, but that is customary\r\nwith shearers, and they don't mind it; they don't even mind it as much as\r\nthe sheep.  They dab a splotch of sheep-dip on the place and go right\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nThe coat of wool was unbelievably thick.  Before the shearing the sheep\r\nlooked like the fat woman in the circus; after it he looked like a bench.\r\nHe was clipped to the skin; and smoothly and uniformly.  The fleece comes\r\nfrom him all in one piece and has the spread of a blanket.\r\n\r\nThe college was flying the Australian flag--the gridiron of England\r\nsmuggled up in the northwest corner of a big red field that had the\r\nrandom stars of the Southern Cross wandering around over it.\r\n\r\nFrom Horsham we went to Stawell.  By rail.  Still in the colony of\r\nVictoria.  Stawell is in the gold-mining country.  In the bank-safe was\r\nhalf a peck of surface-gold--gold dust, grain gold; rich; pure in fact,\r\nand pleasant to sift through one's fingers; and would be pleasanter if it\r\nwould stick.  And there were a couple of gold bricks, very heavy to\r\nhandle, and worth $7,500 a piece.  They were from a very valuable quartz\r\nmine; a lady owns two-thirds of it; she has an income of $75,000 a month\r\nfrom it, and is able to keep house.\r\n\r\nThe Stawell region is not productive of gold only; it has great\r\nvineyards, and produces exceptionally fine wines.  One of these\r\nvineyards--the Great Western, owned by Mr. Irving--is regarded as a\r\nmodel.  Its product has reputation abroad.  It yields a choice champagne\r\nand a fine claret, and its hock took a prize in France two or three years\r\nago.  The champagne is kept in a maze of passages under ground, cut in\r\nthe rock, to secure it an even temperature during the three-year term\r\nrequired to perfect it.  In those vaults I saw 120,000 bottles of\r\nchampagne.  The colony of Victoria has a population of 1,000,000, and\r\nthose people are said to drink 25,000,000 bottles of champagne per year.\r\nThe dryest community on the earth.  The government has lately reduced the\r\nduty upon foreign wines.  That is one of the unkindnesses of Protection.\r\nA man invests years of work and a vast sum of money in a worthy\r\nenterprise, upon the faith of existing laws; then the law is changed, and\r\nthe man is robbed by his own government.\r\n\r\nOn the way back to Stawell we had a chance to see a group of boulders\r\ncalled the Three Sisters--a curiosity oddly located; for it was upon high\r\nground, with the land sloping away from it, and no height above it from\r\nwhence the boulders could have rolled down.  Relics of an early\r\nice-drift, perhaps.  They are noble boulders.  One of them has the size\r\nand smoothness and plump sphericity of a balloon of the biggest pattern.\r\n\r\nThe road led through a forest of great gum-trees, lean and scraggy and\r\nsorrowful.  The road was cream-white--a clayey kind of earth, apparently.\r\nAlong it toiled occasional freight wagons, drawn by long double files of\r\noxen.  Those wagons were going a journey of two hundred miles, I was\r\ntold, and were running a successful opposition to the railway!  The\r\nrailways are owned and run by the government.\r\n\r\nThose sad gums stood up out of the dry white clay, pictures of patience\r\nand resignation.  It is a tree that can get along without water; still it\r\nis fond of it--ravenously so.  It is a very intelligent tree and will\r\ndetect the presence of hidden water at a distance of fifty feet, and send\r\nout slender long root-fibres to prospect it.  They will find it; and will\r\nalso get at it even through a cement wall six inches thick.  Once a\r\ncement water-pipe under ground at Stawell began to gradually reduce its\r\noutput, and finally ceased altogether to deliver water.  Upon examining\r\ninto the matter it was found stopped up, wadded compactly with a mass of\r\nroot-fibres, delicate and hair-like.  How this stuff had gotten into the\r\npipe was a puzzle for some little time; finally it was found that it had\r\ncrept in through a crack that was almost invisible to the eye.  A gum\r\ntree forty feet away had tapped the pipe and was drinking the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Queen's English.\xe2\x80\x9d The property has gone\r\ninto the hands of a joint stock company and we own the bulk of the\r\nshares!\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nFrequently, in Australia, one has cloud-effects of an unfamiliar sort.\r\nWe had this kind of scenery, finely staged, all the way to Ballarat.\r\nConsequently we saw more sky than country on that journey.  At one time a\r\ngreat stretch of the vault was densely flecked with wee ragged-edged\r\nflakes of painfully white cloud-stuff, all of one shape and size, and\r\nequidistant apart, with narrow cracks of adorable blue showing between.\r\nThe whole was suggestive of a hurricane of snow-flakes drifting across\r\nthe skies.  By and by these flakes fused themselves together in\r\ninterminable lines, with shady faint hollows between the lines, the long\r\nsatin-surfaced rollers following each other in simulated movement, and\r\nenchantingly counterfeiting the majestic march of a flowing sea.  Later,\r\nthe sea solidified itself; then gradually broke up its mass into\r\ninnumerable lofty white pillars of about one size, and ranged these\r\nacross the firmament, in receding and fading perspective, in the\r\nsimilitude of a stupendous colonnade--a mirage without a doubt flung from\r\nthe far Gates of the Hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe approaches to Ballarat were beautiful.  The features, great green\r\nexpanses of rolling pasture-land, bisected by eye-contenting hedges of\r\ncommingled new-gold and old-gold gorse--and a lovely lake.  One must put\r\nin the pause, there, to fetch the reader up with a slight jolt, and keep\r\nhim from gliding by without noticing the lake.  One must notice it; for a\r\nlovely lake is not as common a thing along the railways of Australia as\r\nare the dry places.  Ninety-two in the shade again, but balmy and\r\ncomfortable, fresh and bracing.  A perfect climate.\r\n\r\nForty-five years ago the site now occupied by the City of Ballarat was a\r\nsylvan solitude as quiet as Eden and as lovely.  Nobody had ever heard of\r\nit.  On the 25th of August, 1851, the first great gold-strike made in\r\nAustralia was made here.  The wandering prospectors who made it scraped\r\nup two pounds and a half of gold the first day-worth $600.  A few days\r\nlater the place was a hive--a town.  The news of the strike spread\r\neverywhere in a sort of instantaneous way--spread like a flash to the\r\nvery ends of the earth.  A celebrity so prompt and so universal has\r\nhardly been paralleled in history, perhaps.  It was as if the name\r\nBALLARAT had suddenly been written on the sky, where all the world could\r\nread it at once.\r\n\r\nThe smaller discoveries made in the colony of New South Wales three\r\nmonths before had already started emigrants toward Australia; they had\r\nbeen coming as a stream, but they came as a flood, now.  A hundred\r\nthousand people poured into Melbourne from England and other countries in\r\na single month, and flocked away to the mines.  The crews of the ships\r\nthat brought them flocked with them; the clerks in the government offices\r\nfollowed; so did the cooks, the maids, the coachmen, the butlers, and the\r\nother domestic servants; so did the carpenters, the smiths, the plumbers,\r\nthe painters, the reporters, the editors, the lawyers, the clients, the\r\nbarkeepers, the bummers, the blacklegs, the thieves, the loose women, the\r\ngrocers, the butchers, the bakers, the doctors, the druggists, the\r\nnurses; so did the police; even officials of high and hitherto envied\r\nplace threw up their positions and joined the procession.  This roaring\r\navalanche swept out of Melbourne and left it desolate, Sunday-like,\r\nparalyzed, everything at a stand-still, the ships lying idle at anchor,\r\nall signs of life departed, all sounds stilled save the rasping of the\r\ncloud-shadows as they scraped across the vacant streets.\r\n\r\nThat grassy and leafy paradise at Ballarat was soon ripped open, and\r\nlacerated and scarified and gutted, in the feverish search for its hidden\r\nriches.  There is nothing like surface-mining to snatch the graces and\r\nbeauties and benignities out of a paradise, and make an odious and\r\nrepulsive spectacle of it.\r\n\r\nWhat fortunes were made!  Immigrants got rich while the ship unloaded and\r\nreloaded--and went back home for good in the same cabin they had come out\r\nin!  Not all of them.  Only some.  I saw the others in Ballarat myself,\r\nforty-five years later--what were left of them by time and death and the\r\ndisposition to rove.  They were young and gay, then; they are patriarchal\r\nand grave, now; and they do not get excited any more.  They talk of the\r\nPast.  They live in it.  Their life is a dream, a retrospection.\r\n\r\nBallarat was a great region for \xe2\x80\x9cnuggets.\xe2\x80\x9d No such nuggets were found in\r\nCalifornia as Ballarat produced.  In fact, the Ballarat region has\r\nyielded the largest ones known to history.  Two of them weighed about 180\r\npounds each, and together were worth $90,000.  They were offered to any\r\npoor person who would shoulder them and carry them away.  Gold was so\r\nplentiful that it made people liberal like that.\r\n\r\nBallarat was a swarming city of tents in the early days.  Everybody was\r\nhappy, for a time, and apparently prosperous.  Then came trouble.  The\r\ngovernment swooped down with a mining tax.  And in its worst form, too;\r\nfor it was not a tax upon what the miner had taken out, but upon what he\r\nwas going to take out--if he could find it.  It was a license tax--\r\nlicense\r\nto work his claim--and it had to be paid before he could begin digging.\r\n\r\nConsider the situation.  No business is so uncertain as surface-mining.\r\nYour claim may be good, and it may be worthless.  It may make you well\r\noff in a month; and then again you may have to dig and slave for half a\r\nyear, at heavy expense, only to find out at last that the gold is not\r\nthere in cost-paying quantity, and that your time and your hard work have\r\nbeen thrown away.  It might be wise policy to advance the miner a monthly\r\nsum to encourage him to develop the country's riches; but to tax him\r\nmonthly in advance instead--why, such a thing was never dreamed of in\r\nAmerica.  There, neither the claim itself nor its products, howsoever\r\nrich or poor, were taxed.\r\n\r\nThe Ballarat miners protested, petitioned, complained--it was of no use;\r\nthe government held its ground, and went on collecting the tax.  And not\r\nby pleasant methods, but by ways which must have been very galling to\r\nfree people.  The rumblings of a coming storm began to be audible.\r\n\r\nBy and by there was a result; and I think it may be called the finest\r\nthing in Australasian history.  It was a revolution--small in size; but\r\ngreat politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for a\r\nprinciple, a stand against injustice and oppression.  It was the Barons\r\nand John, over again; it was Hampden and Ship-Money; it was Concord and\r\nLexington; small beginnings, all of them, but all of them great in\r\npolitical results, all of them epoch-making.  It is another instance of a\r\nvictory won by a lost battle.  It adds an honorable page to history; the\r\npeople know it and are proud of it.  They keep green the memory of the\r\nmen who fell at the Eureka Stockade, and Peter Lalor has his monument.\r\n\r\nThe surface-soil of Ballarat was full of gold.  This soil the miners\r\nripped and tore and trenched and harried and disembowled, and made it\r\nyield up its immense treasure.  Then they went down into the earth with\r\ndeep shafts, seeking the gravelly beds of ancient rivers and brooks--and\r\nfound them.  They followed the courses of these streams, and gutted them,\r\nsending the gravel up in buckets to the upper world, and washing out of\r\nit its enormous deposits of gold.  The next biggest of the two monster\r\nnuggets mentioned above came from an old river-channel 180 feet under\r\nground.\r\n\r\nFinally the quartz lodes were attacked.  That is not poor-man's mining.\r\nQuartz-mining and milling require capital, and staying-power, and\r\npatience.  Big companies were formed, and for several decades, now, the\r\nlodes have been successfully worked, and have yielded great wealth.\r\nSince the gold discovery in 1853 the Ballarat mines--taking the three\r\nkinds of mining together--have contributed to the world's pocket\r\nsomething over three hundred millions of dollars, which is to say that\r\nthis nearly invisible little spot on the earth's surface has yielded\r\nabout one-fourth as much gold in forty-four years as all California has\r\nyielded in forty-seven.  The Californian aggregate, from 1848 to 1895,\r\ninclusive, as reported by the Statistician of the United States Mint, is\r\n$1,265,217,217.\r\n\r\nA citizen told me a curious thing about those mines.  With all my\r\nexperience of mining I had never heard of anything of the sort before.\r\nThe main gold reef runs about north and south--of course--for that is the\r\ncustom of a rich gold reef.  At Ballarat its course is between walls of\r\nslate.  Now the citizen told me that throughout a stretch of twelve miles\r\nalong the reef, the reef is crossed at intervals by a straight black\r\nstreak of a carbonaceous nature--a streak in the slate; a streak no\r\nthicker than a pencil--and that wherever it crosses the reef you will\r\ncertainly find gold at the junction.  It is called the Indicator.  Thirty\r\nfeet on each side of the Indicator (and down in the slate, of course) is\r\na still finer streak--a streak as fine as a pencil mark; and indeed, that\r\nis its name Pencil Mark.  Whenever you find the Pencil Mark you know that\r\nthirty feet from it is the Indicator; you measure the distance, excavate,\r\nfind the Indicator, trace it straight to the reef, and sink your shaft;\r\nyour fortune is made, for certain.  If that is true, it is curious.  And\r\nit is curious anyway.\r\n\r\nBallarat is a town of only 40,000 population; and yet, since it is in\r\nAustralia, it has every essential of an advanced and enlightened big\r\ncity.  This is pure matter of course.  I must stop dwelling upon these\r\nthings.  It is hard to keep from dwelling upon them, though; for it is\r\ndifficult to get away from the surprise of it.  I will let the other\r\ndetails go, this time, but I must allow myself to mention that this\r\nlittle town has a park of 326 acres; a flower garden of 83 acres, with an\r\nelaborate and expensive fernery in it and some costly and unusually fine\r\nstatuary; and an artificial lake covering 600 acres, equipped with a\r\nfleet of 200 shells, small sail boats, and little steam yachts.\r\n\r\nAt this point I strike out some other praiseful things which I was\r\ntempted to add.  I do not strike them out because they were not true or\r\nnot well said, but because I find them better said by another man--and a\r\nman more competent to testify, too, because he belongs on the ground, and\r\nknows.  I clip them from a chatty speech delivered some years ago by Mr.\r\nWilliam Little, who was at that time mayor of Ballarat:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe language of our citizens, in this as in other parts of\r\n     Australasia, is mostly healthy Anglo-Saxon, free from Americanisms,\r\n     vulgarisms, and the conflicting dialects of our Fatherland, and is\r\n     pure enough to suit a Trench or a Latham.  Our youth, aided by\r\n     climatic influence, are in point of physique and comeliness\r\n     unsurpassed in the Sunny South.  Our young men are well ordered; and\r\n     our maidens, 'not stepping over the bounds of modesty,' are as fair\r\n     as Psyches, dispensing smiles as charming as November flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe closing clause has the seeming of a rather frosty compliment, but\r\nthat is apparent only, not real.  November is summer-time there.\r\n\r\nHis compliment to the local purity of the language is warranted.  It is\r\nquite free from impurities; this is acknowledged far and wide.  As in the\r\nGerman Empire all cultivated people claim to speak Hanovarian German, so\r\nin Australasia all cultivated people claim to speak Ballarat English.\r\nEven in England this cult has made considerable progress, and now that it\r\nis favored by the two great Universities, the time is not far away when\r\nBallarat English will come into general use among the educated classes of\r\nGreat Britain at large.  Its great merit is, that it is shorter than\r\nordinary English--that is, it is more compressed.  At first you have some\r\ndifficulty in understanding it when it is spoken as rapidly as the orator\r\nwhom I have quoted speaks it.  An illustration will show what I mean.\r\nWhen he called and I handed him a chair, he bowed and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently, when we were lighting our cigars, he held a match to mine and\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen I saw.  'Q' is the end of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you\xe2\x80\x9d 'Km'  is the end\r\nof the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cYou are welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Little puts no emphasis upon either\r\nof them, but delivers them so reduced that they hardly have a sound.  All\r\nBallarat English is like that, and the effect is very soft and pleasant;\r\nit takes all the hardness and harshness out of our tongue and gives to it\r\na delicate whispery and vanishing cadence which charms the ear like the\r\nfaint rustling of the forest leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClassic.\xe2\x80\x9d  A book which people praise and don't read.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOn the rail again--bound for Bendigo.  From diary:\r\n\r\nOctober 23.  Got up at 6, left at 7.30; soon reached Castlemaine, one of\r\nthe rich gold-fields of the early days; waited several hours for a train;\r\nleft at 3.40 and reached Bendigo in an hour.  For comrade, a Catholic\r\npriest who was better than I was, but didn't seem to know it--a man full\r\nof graces of the heart, the mind, and the spirit; a lovable man.  He will\r\nrise.  He will be a bishop some day.  Later an Archbishop.  Later a\r\nCardinal.  Finally an Archangel, I hope.  And then he will recall me when\r\nI say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that trip we made from Ballarat to Bendigo, when\r\nyou were nothing but Father C., and I was nothing to what I am now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It has actually taken nine hours to come from Ballarat to Bendigo.  We\r\ncould have saved seven by walking.  However, there was no hurry.\r\n\r\nBendigo was another of the rich strikes of the early days.  It does a\r\ngreat quartz-mining business, now--that business which, more than any\r\nother that I know of, teaches patience, and requires grit and a steady\r\nnerve.  The town is full of towering chimney-stacks, and hoisting-works,\r\nand looks like a petroleum-city.  Speaking of patience; for example, one\r\nof the local companies went steadily on with its deep borings and\r\nsearchings without show of gold or a penny of reward for eleven years\r\n--then struck it, and became suddenly rich.  The eleven years' work had\r\ncost $55,000, and the first gold found was a grain the size of a pin's\r\nhead.  It is kept under locks and bars, as a precious thing, and is\r\nreverently shown to the visitor, \xe2\x80\x9chats off.\xe2\x80\x9d  When I saw it I had not\r\nheard its history.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is gold.  Examine it--take the glass.  Now how much should you say it\r\nis worth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say about two cents; or in your English dialect, four\r\nfarthings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it cost L11,000.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it did.  Ballarat and Bendigo have produced the three monumental\r\nnuggets of the world, and this one is the monumentalest one of the three.\r\nThe other two represent L9,000 a piece; this one a couple of thousand\r\nmore.  It is small, and not much to look at, but it is entitled to (its)\r\nname--Adam.  It is the Adam-nugget of this mine, and its children run up\r\ninto the millions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSpeaking of patience again, another of the mines was worked, under heavy\r\nexpenses, during 17 years before pay was struck, and still another one\r\ncompelled a wait of 21 years before pay was struck; then, in both\r\ninstances, the outlay was all back in a year or two, with compound\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nBendigo has turned out even more gold than Ballarat.  The two together\r\nhave produced $650,000,000 worth--which is half as much as California\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIt was through Mr. Blank--not to go into particulars about his name--it\r\nwas mainly through Mr. Blank that my stay in Bendigo was made memorably\r\npleasant and interesting.  He explained this to me himself.  He told me\r\nthat it was through his influence that the city government invited me to\r\nthe town-hall to hear complimentary speeches and respond to them; that it\r\nwas through his influence that I had been taken on a long pleasure-drive\r\nthrough the city and shown its notable features; that it was through his\r\ninfluence that I was invited to visit the great mines; that it was\r\nthrough his influence that I was taken to the hospital and allowed to see\r\nthe convalescent Chinaman who had been attacked at midnight in his lonely\r\nhut eight weeks before by robbers, and stabbed forty-six times and\r\nscalped besides; that it was through his influence that when I arrived\r\nthis awful spectacle of piecings and patchings and bandagings was sitting\r\nup in his cot letting on to read one of my books; that it was through his\r\ninfluence that efforts had been made to get the Catholic Archbishop of\r\nBendigo to invite me to dinner; that it was through his influence that\r\nefforts had been made to get the Anglican Bishop of Bendigo to ask me to\r\nsupper; that it was through his influence that the dean of the editorial\r\nfraternity had driven me through the woodsy outlying country and shown\r\nme, from the summit of Lone Tree Hill, the mightiest and loveliest\r\nexpanse of forest-clad mountain and valley that I had seen in all\r\nAustralia.  And when he asked me what had most impressed me in Bendigo\r\nand I answered and said it was the taste and the public spirit which had\r\nadorned the streets with 105 miles of shade trees, he said that it was\r\nthrough his influence that it had been done.\r\n\r\nBut I am not representing him quite correctly.  He did not say it was\r\nthrough his influence that all these things had happened--for that would\r\nhave been coarse; he merely conveyed that idea; conveyed it so subtly\r\nthat I only caught it fleetingly, as one catches vagrant faint breaths of\r\nperfume when one traverses the meadows in summer; conveyed it without\r\noffense and without any suggestion of egoism or ostentation--but conveyed\r\nit, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHe was an Irishman; an educated gentleman; grave, and kindly, and\r\ncourteous; a bachelor, and about forty-five or possibly fifty years old,\r\napparently.  He called upon me at the hotel, and it was there that we had\r\nthis talk.  He made me like him, and did it without trouble.  This was\r\npartly through his winning and gentle ways, but mainly through the\r\namazing familiarity with my books which his conversation showed.  He was\r\ndown to date with them, too; and if he had made them the study of his\r\nlife he could hardly have been better posted as to their contents than he\r\nwas.  He made me better satisfied with myself than I had ever been\r\nbefore.  It was plain that he had a deep fondness for humor, yet he never\r\nlaughed; he never even chuckled; in fact, humor could not win to outward\r\nexpression on his face at all.  No, he was always grave--tenderly,\r\npensively grave; but he made me laugh, all along; and this was very\r\ntrying--and very pleasant at the same time--for it was at quotations from\r\nmy own books.\r\n\r\nWhen he was going, he turned and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't remember me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?  Why, no.  Have we met before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was a matter of correspondence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCorrespondence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, many years ago.  Twelve or fifteen.  Oh, longer than that.  But of\r\ncourse you----\xe2\x80\x9d  A musing pause.  Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember Corrigan Castle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no, I believe I don't.  I don't seem to recall the name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited a moment, pondering, with the door-knob in his hand, then\r\nstarted out; but turned back and said that I had once been interested in\r\nCorrigan Castle, and asked me if I would go with him to his quarters in\r\nthe evening and take a hot Scotch and talk it over.  I was a teetotaler\r\nand liked relaxation, so I said I would.\r\n\r\nWe drove from the lecture-hall together about half-past ten.  He had a\r\nmost comfortably and tastefully furnished parlor, with good pictures on\r\nthe walls, Indian and Japanese ornaments on the mantel, and here and\r\nthere, and books everywhere-largely mine; which made me proud.  The light\r\nwas brilliant, the easy chairs were deep-cushioned, the arrangements for\r\nbrewing and smoking were all there.  We brewed and lit up; then he passed\r\na sheet of note-paper to me and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe paper was of a sumptuous quality.  At the top was a twisted and\r\ninterlaced monogram printed from steel dies in gold and blue and red, in\r\nthe ornate English fashion of long years ago; and under it, in neat\r\ngothic capitals was this--printed in blue:\r\n\r\n                          THE MARK TWAIN CLUB\r\n                            CORRIGAN CASTLE\r\n                           ............187..\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chow did you come by this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was President of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!--you don't mean it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true.  I was its first President.  I was re-elected annually as\r\nlong as its meetings were held in my castle--Corrigan--which was five\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he showed me an album with twenty-three photographs of me in it.\r\nFive of them were of old dates, the others of various later crops; the\r\nlist closed with a picture taken by Falk in Sydney a month before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou sent us the first five; the rest were bought.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was paradise!  We ran late, and talked, talked, talked--subject, the\r\nMark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle, Ireland.\r\n\r\nMy first knowledge of that Club dates away back; all of twenty years, I\r\nshould say.  It came to me in the form of a courteous letter, written on\r\nthe note-paper which I have described, and signed \xe2\x80\x9cBy order of the\r\nPresident; C. PEMBROKE, Secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d  It conveyed the fact that the Club\r\nhad been created in my honor, and added the hope that this token of\r\nappreciation of my work would meet with my approval.\r\n\r\nI answered, with thanks; and did what I could to keep my gratification\r\nfrom over-exposure.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the long correspondence began.  A letter came back, by\r\norder of the President, furnishing me the names of the members-thirty-two\r\nin number.  With it came a copy of the Constitution and By-Laws, in\r\npamphlet form, and artistically printed.  The initiation fee and dues\r\nwere in their proper place; also, schedule of meetings--monthly--for\r\nessays upon works of mine, followed by discussions; quarterly for\r\nbusiness and a supper, without essays, but with after-supper speeches;\r\nalso there was a list of the officers: President, Vice-President,\r\nSecretary, Treasurer, etc.  The letter was brief, but it was pleasant\r\nreading, for it told me about the strong interest which the membership\r\ntook in their new venture, etc., etc.  It also asked me for a photograph\r\n--a special one.  I went down and sat for it and sent it--with a letter,\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nPresently came the badge of the Club, and very dainty and pretty it was;\r\nand very artistic.  It was a frog peeping out from a graceful tangle of\r\ngrass-sprays and rushes, and was done in enamels on a gold basis, and had\r\na gold pin back of it.  After I had petted it, and played with it, and\r\ncaressed it, and enjoyed it a couple of hours, the light happened to fall\r\nupon it at a new angle, and revealed to me a cunning new detail; with the\r\nlight just right, certain delicate shadings of the grass-blades and\r\nrush-stems wove themselves into a monogram--mine!  You can see that that\r\njewel was a work of art.  And when you come to consider the intrinsic\r\nvalue of it, you must concede that it is not every literary club that\r\ncould afford a badge like that.  It was easily worth $75, in the opinion\r\nof Messrs. Marcus and Ward of New York.  They said they could not\r\nduplicate it for that and make a profit.  By this time the Club was well\r\nunder way; and from that time forth its secretary kept my off-hours well\r\nsupplied with business.  He reported the Club's discussions of my books\r\nwith laborious fullness, and did his work with great spirit and ability.\r\nAs a, rule, he synopsized; but when a speech was especially brilliant, he\r\nshort-handed it and gave me the best passages from it, written out.\r\nThere were five speakers whom he particularly favored in that way:\r\nPalmer, Forbes, Naylor, Norris, and Calder.  Palmer and Forbes could\r\nnever get through a speech without attacking each other, and each in his\r\nown way was formidably effective--Palmer in virile and eloquent abuse,\r\nForbes in courtly and elegant but scalding satire.  I could always tell\r\nwhich of them was talking without looking for his name.  Naylor had a\r\npolished style and a happy knack at felicitous metaphor; Norris's style\r\nwas wholly without ornament, but enviably compact, lucid, and strong.\r\nBut after all, Calder was the gem.  He never spoke when sober, he spoke\r\ncontinuously when he wasn't.  And certainly they were the drunkest\r\nspeeches that a man ever uttered.  They were full of good things, but so\r\nincredibly mixed up and wandering that it made one's head swim to follow\r\nhim.  They were not intended to be funny, but they were,--funny for the\r\nvery gravity which the speaker put into his flowing miracles of\r\nincongruity.  In the course of five years I came to know the styles of\r\nthe five orators as well as I knew the style of any speaker in my own\r\nclub at home.\r\n\r\nThese reports came every month.  They were written on foolscap, 600 words\r\nto the page, and usually about twenty-five pages in a report--a good\r\n15,000 words, I should say,--a solid week's work.  The reports were\r\nabsorbingly entertaining, long as they were; but, unfortunately for me,\r\nthey did not come alone.  They were always accompanied by a lot of\r\nquestions about passages and purposes in my books, which the Club wanted\r\nanswered; and additionally accompanied every quarter by the Treasurer's\r\nreport, and the Auditor's report, and the Committee's report, and the\r\nPresident's review, and my opinion of these was always desired; also\r\nsuggestions for the good of the Club, if any occurred to me.\r\n\r\nBy and by I came to dread those things; and this dread grew and grew and\r\ngrew; grew until I got to anticipating them with a cold horror.  For I\r\nwas an indolent man, and not fond of letter-writing, and whenever these\r\nthings came I had to put everything by and sit down--for my own peace of\r\nmind--and dig and dig until I got something out of my head which would\r\nanswer for a reply.  I got along fairly well the first year; but for the\r\nsucceeding four years the Mark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle was my\r\ncurse, my nightmare, the grief and misery of my life.  And I got so, so\r\nsick of sitting for photographs.  I sat every year for five years, trying\r\nto satisfy that insatiable organization.  Then at last I rose in revolt.\r\nI could endure my oppressions no longer.  I pulled my fortitude together\r\nand tore off my chains, and was a free man again, and happy.  From that\r\nday I burned the secretary's fat envelopes the moment they arrived, and\r\nby and by they ceased to come.\r\n\r\nWell, in the sociable frankness of that night in Bendigo I brought this\r\nall out in full confession.  Then Mr. Blank came out in the same frank\r\nway, and with a preliminary word of gentle apology said that he was the\r\nMark Twain Club, and the only member it had ever had!\r\n\r\nWhy, it was matter for anger, but I didn't feel any.  He said he never\r\nhad to work for a living, and that by the time he was thirty life had\r\nbecome a bore and a weariness to him.  He had no interests left; they had\r\npaled and perished, one by one, and left him desolate.  He had begun to\r\nthink of suicide.  Then all of a sudden he thought of that happy idea of\r\nstarting an imaginary club, and went straightway to work at it, with\r\nenthusiasm and love.  He was charmed with it; it gave him something to\r\ndo.  It elaborated itself on his hands;--it became twenty times more\r\ncomplex and formidable than was his first rude draft of it.  Every new\r\naddition to his original plan which cropped up in his mind gave him a\r\nfresh interest and a new pleasure.  He designed the Club badge himself,\r\nand worked over it, altering and improving it, a number of days and\r\nnights; then sent to London and had it made.  It was the only one that\r\nwas made.  It was made for me; the \xe2\x80\x9crest of the Club\xe2\x80\x9d went without.\r\n\r\nHe invented the thirty-two members and their names.  He invented the five\r\nfavorite speakers and their five separate styles.  He invented their\r\nspeeches, and reported them himself.  He would have kept that Club going\r\nuntil now, if I hadn't deserted, he said.  He said he worked like a slave\r\nover those reports; each of them cost him from a week to a fortnight's\r\nwork, and the work gave him pleasure and kept him alive and willing to be\r\nalive.  It was a bitter blow to him when the Club died.\r\n\r\nFinally, there wasn't any Corrigan Castle.  He had invented that, too.\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful--the whole thing; and altogether the most ingenious and\r\nlaborious and cheerful and painstaking practical joke I have ever heard\r\nof.  And I liked it; liked to hear him tell about it; yet I have been a\r\nhater of practical jokes from as long back as I can remember.  Finally he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember a note from Melbourne fourteen or fifteen years ago,\r\ntelling about your lecture tour in Australia, and your death and burial\r\nin Melbourne?--a note from Henry Bascomb, of Bascomb Hall, Upper\r\nHolywell, Hants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wrote it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM-y-word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did it.  I don't know why.  I just took the notion, and carried\r\nit out without stopping to think.  It was wrong.  It could have done\r\nharm.  I was always sorry about it afterward.  You must forgive me.  I\r\nwas Mr. Bascom's guest on his yacht, on his voyage around the world.  He\r\noften spoke of you, and of the pleasant times you had had together in his\r\nhome; and the notion took me, there in Melbourne, and I imitated his\r\nhand, and wrote the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo the mystery was cleared up, after so many, many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nThere are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one! keep\r\nfrom telling their happinesses to the unhappy.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nAfter visits to Maryborough and some other Australian towns, we presently\r\ntook passage for New Zealand.  If it would not look too much like showing\r\noff, I would tell the reader where New Zealand is; for he is as I was; he\r\nthinks he knows.  And he thinks he knows where Hertzegovina is; and how\r\nto pronounce pariah; and how to use the word unique without exposing\r\nhimself to the derision of the dictionary.  But in truth, he knows none\r\nof these things.  There are but four or five people in the world who\r\npossess this knowledge, and these make their living out of it.  They\r\ntravel from place to place, visiting literary assemblages, geographical\r\nsocieties, and seats of learning, and springing sudden bets that these\r\npeople do not know these things.  Since all people think they know them,\r\nthey are an easy prey to these adventurers.  Or rather they were an easy\r\nprey until the law interfered, three months ago, and a New York court\r\ndecided that this kind of gambling is illegal, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it traverses\r\nArticle IV, Section 9, of the Constitution of the United States, which\r\nforbids betting on a sure thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  This decision was rendered by the full\r\nBench of the New York Supreme Court, after a test sprung upon the court\r\nby counsel for the prosecution, which showed that none of the nine Judges\r\nwas able to answer any of the four questions.\r\n\r\nAll people think that New Zealand is close to Australia or Asia, or\r\nsomewhere, and that you cross to it on a bridge.  But that is not so.  It\r\nis not close to anything, but lies by itself, out in the water.  It is\r\nnearest to Australia, but still not near.  The gap between is very wide.\r\nIt will be a surprise to the reader, as it was to me, to learn that the\r\ndistance from Australia to New Zealand is really twelve or thirteen\r\nhundred miles, and that there is no bridge.  I learned this from\r\nProfessor X., of Yale University, whom I met in the steamer on the great\r\nlakes when I was crossing the continent to sail across the Pacific.  I\r\nasked him about New Zealand, in order to make conversation.  I supposed\r\nhe would generalize a little without compromising himself, and then turn\r\nthe subject to something he was acquainted with, and my object would then\r\nbe attained; the ice would be broken, and we could go smoothly on, and\r\nget acquainted, and have a pleasant time.  But, to my surprise, he was\r\nnot only not embarrassed by my question, but seemed to welcome it, and to\r\ntake a distinct interest in it.  He began to talk--fluently, confidently,\r\ncomfortably; and as he talked, my admiration grew and grew; for as the\r\nsubject developed under his hands, I saw that he not only knew where New\r\nZealand was, but that he was minutely familiar with every detail of its\r\nhistory, politics, religions, and commerce, its fauna, flora, geology,\r\nproducts, and climatic peculiarities.  When he was done, I was lost in\r\nwonder and admiration, and said to myself, he knows everything; in the\r\ndomain of human knowledge he is king.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see him do more miracles; and so, just for the pleasure of\r\nhearing him answer, I asked him about Hertzegovina, and pariah, and\r\nunique.  But he began to generalize then, and show distress.  I saw that\r\nwith New Zealand gone, he was a Samson shorn of his locks; he was as\r\nother men.  This was a curious and interesting mystery, and I was frank\r\nwith him, and asked him to explain it.\r\n\r\nHe tried to avoid it at first; but then laughed and said that after all,\r\nthe matter was not worth concealment, so he would let me into the secret.\r\nIn substance, this is his story:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLast autumn I was at work one morning at home, when a card came up--the\r\ncard of a stranger.  Under the name was printed a line which showed that\r\nthis visitor was Professor of Theological Engineering in Wellington\r\nUniversity, New Zealand.  I was troubled--troubled, I mean, by the\r\nshortness of the notice.  College etiquette required that he be at once\r\ninvited to dinner by some member of the Faculty--invited to dine on that\r\nday--not, put off till a subsequent day.  I did not quite know what to\r\ndo.  College etiquette requires, in the case of a foreign guest, that the\r\ndinner-talk shall begin with complimentary references to his country, its\r\ngreat men, its services to civilization, its seats of learning, and\r\nthings like that; and of course the host is responsible, and must either\r\nbegin this talk himself or see that it is done by some one else.  I was\r\nin great difficulty; and the more I searched my memory, the more my\r\ntrouble grew.  I found that I knew nothing about New Zealand.  I thought\r\nI knew where it was, and that was all.  I had an impression that it was\r\nclose to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and that one went over to it\r\non a bridge.  This might turn out to be incorrect; and even if correct,\r\nit would not furnish matter enough for the purpose at the dinner, and I\r\nshould expose my College to shame before my guest; he would see that I, a\r\nmember of the Faculty of the first University in America, was wholly\r\nignorant of his country, and he would go away and tell this, and laugh at\r\nit.  The thought of it made my face burn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sent for my wife and told her how I was situated, and asked for her\r\nhelp, and she thought of a thing which I might have thought of myself, if\r\nI had not been excited and worried.  She said she would go and tell the\r\nvisitor that I was out but would be in in a few minutes; and she would\r\ntalk, and keep him busy while I got out the back way and hurried over and\r\nmake Professor Lawson give the dinner.  For Lawson knew everything, and\r\ncould meet the guest in a creditable way and save the reputation of the\r\nUniversity.  I ran to Lawson, but was disappointed.  He did not know\r\nanything about New Zealand.  He said that, as far as his recollection\r\nwent it was close to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and you go over to\r\nit on a bridge; but that was all he knew.  It was too bad.  Lawson was a\r\nperfect encyclopedia of abstruse learning; but now in this hour of our\r\nneed, it turned out that he did not know any useful thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe consulted.  He saw that the reputation of the University was in very\r\nreal peril, and he walked the floor in anxiety, talking, and trying to\r\nthink out some way to meet the difficulty.  Presently he decided that we\r\nmust try the rest of the Faculty--some of them might know about New\r\nZealand.  So we went to the telephone and called up the professor of\r\nastronomy and asked him, and he said that all he knew was, that it was\r\nclose to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and you went over to it on----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shut him off and called up the professor of biology, and he said that\r\nall he knew was that it was close to Aus----.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shut him off, and sat down, worried and disheartened, to see if we\r\ncould think up some other scheme.  We shortly hit upon one which promised\r\nwell, and this one we adopted, and set its machinery going at once.  It\r\nwas this.  Lawson must give the dinner.  The Faculty must be notified by\r\ntelephone to prepare.  We must all get to work diligently, and at the end\r\nof eight hours and a half we must come to dinner acquainted with New\r\nZealand; at least well enough informed to appear without discredit before\r\nthis native.  To seem properly intelligent we should have to know about\r\nNew Zealand's population, and politics, and form of government, and\r\ncommerce, and taxes, and products, and ancient history, and modern\r\nhistory, and varieties of religion, and nature of the laws, and their\r\ncodification, and amount of revenue, and whence drawn, and methods of\r\ncollection, and percentage of loss, and character of climate, and--well,\r\na lot of things like that; we must suck the maps and cyclopedias dry.\r\nAnd while we posted up in this way, the Faculty's wives must flock over,\r\none after the other, in a studiedly casual way, and help my wife keep the\r\nNew Zealander quiet, and not let him get out and come interfering with\r\nour studies.  The scheme worked admirably; but it stopped business,\r\nstopped it entirely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in the official log-book of Yale, to be read and wondered at by\r\nfuture generations--the account of the Great Blank Day--the memorable\r\nBlank Day--the day wherein the wheels of culture were stopped, a Sunday\r\nsilence prevailed all about, and the whole University stood still while\r\nthe Faculty read-up and qualified itself to sit at meat, without shame,\r\nin the presence of the Professor of Theological Engineering from New\r\nZealand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we assembled at the dinner we were miserably tired and worn--but we\r\nwere posted.  Yes, it is fair to claim that.  In fact, erudition is a\r\npale name for it.  New Zealand was the only subject; and it was just\r\nbeautiful to hear us ripple it out.  And with such an air of\r\nunembarrassed ease, and unostentatious familiarity with detail, and\r\ntrained and seasoned mastery of the subject-and oh, the grace and fluency\r\nof it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, finally somebody happened to notice that the guest was looking\r\ndazed, and wasn't saying anything.  So they stirred him up, of course.\r\nThen that man came out with a good, honest, eloquent compliment that made\r\nthe Faculty blush.  He said he was not worthy to sit in the company of\r\nmen like these; that he had been silent from admiration; that he had been\r\nsilent from another cause also--silent from shame--silent from ignorance!\r\n'For,' said he, 'I, who have lived eighteen years in New Zealand and have\r\nserved five in a professorship, and ought to know much about that\r\ncountry, perceive, now, that I know almost nothing about it.  I say it\r\nwith shame, that I have learned fifty times, yes, a hundred times more\r\nabout New Zealand in these two hours at this table than I ever knew\r\nbefore in all the eighteen years put together.  I was silent because I\r\ncould not help myself.  What I knew about taxes, and policies, and laws,\r\nand revenue, and products, and history, and all that multitude of things,\r\nwas but general, and ordinary, and vague-unscientific, in a word--and it\r\nwould have been insanity to expose it here to the searching glare of your\r\namazingly accurate and all-comprehensive knowledge of those matters,\r\ngentlemen.  I beg you to let me sit silent--as becomes me.  But do not\r\nchange the subject; I can at least follow you, in this one; whereas if\r\nyou change to one which shall call out the full strength of your mighty\r\nerudition, I shall be as one lost.  If you know all this about a remote\r\nlittle inconsequent patch like New Zealand, ah, what wouldn't you know\r\nabout any other Subject!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nMan is the Only Animal that Blushes.

A fine day, a brilliant sun.  Warm in the sun, cold\r\nin the shade--an icy breeze blowing out of the south.  A solemn long\r\nswell rolling up northward.  It comes from the South Pole, with nothing\r\nin the way to obstruct its march and tone its energy down.  I have read\r\nsomewhere that an acute observer among the early explorers--Cook? or\r\nTasman?--accepted this majestic swell as trustworthy circumstantial\r\nevidence that no important land lay to the southward, and so did not\r\nwaste time on a useless quest in that direction, but changed his course\r\nand went searching elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfternoon.   Passing between Tasmania (formerly Van Diemen's Land) and\r\nneighboring islands--islands whence the poor exiled Tasmanian savages\r\nused to gaze at their lost homeland and cry; and die of broken hearts.\r\nHow glad I am that all these native races are dead and gone, or nearly\r\nso.  The work was mercifully swift and horrible in some portions of\r\nAustralia.  As far as Tasmania is concerned, the extermination was\r\ncomplete: not a native is left.  It was a strife of years, and decades of\r\nyears.  The Whites and the Blacks hunted each other, ambushed each other,\r\nbutchered each other.  The Blacks were not numerous.  But they were wary,\r\nalert, cunning, and they knew their country well.  They lasted a long\r\ntime, few as they were, and inflicted much slaughter upon the Whites.\r\n\r\nThe Government wanted to save the Blacks from ultimate extermination, if\r\npossible.  One of its schemes was to capture them and coop them up, on a\r\nneighboring island, under guard.  Bodies of Whites volunteered for the\r\nhunt, for the pay was good--L5 for each Black captured and delivered, but\r\nthe success achieved was not very satisfactory.  The Black was naked, and\r\nhis body was greased.  It was hard to get a grip on him that would hold.\r\nThe Whites moved about in armed bodies, and surprised little families of\r\nnatives, and did make captures; but it was suspected that in these\r\nsurprises half a dozen natives were killed to one caught--and that was\r\nnot what the Government desired.\r\n\r\nAnother scheme was to drive the natives into a corner of the island and\r\nfence them in by a cordon of men placed in line across the country; but\r\nthe natives managed to slip through, constantly, and continue their\r\nmurders and arsons.\r\n\r\nThe governor warned these unlettered savages by printed proclamation that\r\nthey must stay in the desolate region officially appointed for them!  The\r\nproclamation was a dead letter; the savages could not read it.  Afterward\r\na picture-proclamation was issued.  It was painted up on boards, and\r\nthese were nailed to trees in the forest.  Herewith is a photographic\r\nreproduction of this fashion-plate.  Substantially it means:\r\n\r\n1.  The Governor wishes the Whites and the Blacks to love each other;\r\n\r\n2.  He loves his black subjects;\r\n\r\n3.  Blacks who kill Whites will be hanged;\r\n\r\n4.  Whites who kill Blacks will be hanged.\r\n\r\nUpon its several schemes the Government spent L30,000 and employed the\r\nlabors and ingenuities of several thousand Whites for a long time with\r\nfailure as a result.  Then, at last, a quarter of a century after the\r\nbeginning of the troubles between the two races, the right man was found.\r\nNo, he found himself.  This was George Augustus Robinson, called in\r\nhistory \xe2\x80\x9cThe Conciliator.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was not educated, and not conspicuous in\r\nany way.  He was a working bricklayer, in Hobart Town.  But he must have\r\nbeen an amazing personality; a man worth traveling far to see.  It may be\r\nhis counterpart appears in history, but I do not know where to look for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe set himself this incredible task: to go out into the wilderness, the\r\njungle, and the mountain-retreats where the hunted and implacable savages\r\nwere hidden, and appear among them unarmed, speak the language of love\r\nand of kindness to them, and persuade them to forsake their homes and the\r\nwild free life that was so dear to them, and go with him and surrender to\r\nthe hated Whites and live under their watch and ward, and upon their\r\ncharity the rest of their lives!  On its face it was the dream of a\r\nmadman.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, his moral-suasion project was sarcastically dubbed the\r\nsugar plum speculation.  If the scheme was striking, and new to the\r\nworld's experience, the situation was not less so.  It was this.  The\r\nWhite population numbered 40,000 in 1831; the Black population numbered\r\nthree hundred.  Not 300 warriors, but 300 men, women, and children.  The\r\nWhites were armed with guns, the Blacks with clubs and spears.  The\r\nWhites had fought the Blacks for a quarter of a century, and had tried\r\nevery thinkable way to capture, kill, or subdue them; and could not do\r\nit.  If white men of any race could have done it, these would have\r\naccomplished it.  But every scheme had failed, the splendid 300, the\r\nmatchless 300 were unconquered, and manifestly unconquerable.  They would\r\nnot yield, they would listen to no terms, they would fight to the bitter\r\nend.  Yet they had no poet to keep up their heart, and sing the marvel of\r\ntheir magnificent patriotism.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five-and-twenty years of hard fighting, the surviving 300\r\nnaked patriots were still defiant, still persistent, still efficacious\r\nwith their rude weapons, and the Gove7rnor and the 40,000 knew not which\r\nway to turn, nor what to do.\r\n\r\nThen the Bricklayer--that wonderful man--proposed to go out into the\r\nwilderness, with no weapon but his tongue, and no protection but his\r\nhonest eye and his humane heart; and track those embittered savages to\r\ntheir lairs in the gloomy forests and among the mountain snows.\r\nNaturally, he was considered a crank.  But he was not quite that.  In\r\nfact, he was a good way short of that.  He was building upon his long and\r\nintimate knowledge of the native character.  The deriders of his project\r\nwere right--from their standpoint--for they believed the natives to be\r\nmere wild beasts; and Robinson was right, from his standpoint--for he\r\nbelieved the natives to be human beings.  The truth did really lie\r\nbetween the two.  The event proved that Robinson's judgment was soundest;\r\nbut about once a month for four years the event came near to giving the\r\nverdict to the deriders, for about that frequently Robinson barely\r\nescaped falling under the native spears.\r\n\r\nBut history shows that he had a thinking head, and was not a mere wild\r\nsentimentalist.  For instance, he wanted the war parties called in\r\nbefore he started unarmed upon his mission of peace.  He wanted the best\r\nchance of success--not a half-chance.  And he was very willing to have\r\nhelp; and so, high rewards were advertised, for any who would go unarmed\r\nwith him.  This opportunity was declined.  Robinson persuaded some tamed\r\nnatives of both sexes to go with him--a strong evidence of his persuasive\r\npowers, for those natives well knew that their destruction would be\r\nalmost certain.  As it turned out, they had to face death over and over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nRobinson and his little party had a difficult undertaking upon their\r\nhands.  They could not ride off, horseback, comfortably into the woods\r\nand call Leonidas and his 300 together for a talk and a treaty the\r\nfollowing day; for the wild men were not in a body; they were scattered,\r\nimmense distances apart, over regions so desolate that even the birds\r\ncould not make a living with the chances offered--scattered in groups of\r\ntwenty, a dozen, half a dozen, even in groups of three.  And the mission\r\nmust go on foot.  Mr. Bonwick furnishes a description of those horrible\r\nregions, whereby it will be seen that even fugitive gangs of the hardiest\r\nand choicest human devils the world has seen--the convicts set apart to\r\npeople the \xe2\x80\x9cHell of Macquarrie Harbor Station\xe2\x80\x9d--were never able, but\r\nonce, to survive the horrors of a march through them, but starving and\r\nstruggling, and fainting and failing, ate each other, and died:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnward, still onward, was the order of the indomitable Robinson.  No one\r\nignorant of the western country of Tasmania can form a correct idea of\r\nthe traveling difficulties.  While I was resident in Hobart Town, the\r\nGovernor, Sir John Franklin, and his lady, undertook the western journey\r\nto Macquarrie Harbor, and suffered terribly.  One man who assisted to\r\ncarry her ladyship through the swamps, gave me his bitter experience of\r\nits miseries.  Several were disabled for life.  No wonder that but one\r\nparty, escaping from Macquarrie Harbor convict settlement, arrived at the\r\ncivilized region in safety.  Men perished in the scrub, were lost in\r\nsnow, or were devoured by their companions.  This was the territory\r\ntraversed by Mr. Robinson and his Black guides.  All honor to his\r\nintrepidity, and their wonderful fidelity!  When they had, in the depth\r\nof winter, to cross deep and rapid rivers, pass among mountains six\r\nthousand feet high, pierce dangerous thickets, and find food in a country\r\nforsaken even by birds, we can realize their hardships.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a frightful journey by Cradle Mountain, and over the lofty plateau\r\nof Middlesex Plains, the travelers experienced unwonted misery, and the\r\ncircumstances called forth the best qualities of the noble little band.\r\nMr. Robinson wrote afterwards to Mr. Secretary Burnett some details of\r\nthis passage of horrors.  In that letter, of Oct 2, 1834, he states that\r\nhis Natives were very reluctant to go over the dreadful mountain passes;\r\nthat 'for seven successive days we continued traveling over one solid\r\nbody of snow;'  that 'the snows were of incredible depth;'  that 'the\r\nNatives were frequently up to their middle in snow.'  But still the\r\nill-clad, ill-fed, diseased, and way-worn men and women were sustained by\r\nthe cheerful voice of their unconquerable friend, and responded most\r\nnobly to his call.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Bonwick says that Robinson's friendly capture of the Big River tribe\r\nremember, it was a whole tribe--\xe2\x80\x9cwas by far the grandest feature of the\r\nwar, and the crowning glory of his efforts.\xe2\x80\x9d The word \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d was not well\r\nchosen, and is misleading.  There was war still, but only the Blacks were\r\nconducting it--the Whites were holding off until Robinson could give his\r\nscheme a fair trial.  I think that we are to understand that the friendly\r\ncapture of that tribe was by far the most important thing, the highest in\r\nvalue, that happened during the whole thirty years of truceless\r\nhostilities; that it was a decisive thing, a peaceful Waterloo, the\r\nsurrender of the native Napoleon and his dreaded forces, the happy ending\r\nof the long strife.  For \xe2\x80\x9cthat tribe was the terror of the colony,\xe2\x80\x9d its\r\nchief \xe2\x80\x9cthe Black Douglas of Bush households.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRobinson knew that these formidable people were lurking somewhere, in\r\nsome remote corner of the hideous regions just described, and he and his\r\nunarmed little party started on a tedious and perilous hunt for them.  At\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x9cthere, under the shadows of the Frenchman's Cap, whose grim cone\r\nrose five thousand feet in the uninhabited westward interior,\xe2\x80\x9d they were\r\nfound.  It was a serious moment.  Robinson himself believed, for once,\r\nthat his mission, successful until now, was to end here in failure, and\r\nthat his own death-hour had struck.\r\n\r\nThe redoubtable chief stood in menacing attitude, with his eighteen-foot\r\nspear poised; his warriors stood massed at his back, armed for battle,\r\ntheir faces eloquent with their long-cherished loathing for white men.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey rattled their spears and shouted their war-cry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Their women were\r\nback of them, laden with supplies of weapons, and keeping their 150 eager\r\ndogs quiet until the chief should give the signal to fall on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we shall soon be in the resurrection,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered a member of\r\nRobinson's little party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think we shall,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Robinson; then plucked up heart and began\r\nhis persuasions--in the tribe's own dialect, which surprised and pleased\r\nthe chief.  Presently there was an interruption by the chief:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are your guns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe warrior was astonished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere your little guns?\xe2\x80\x9d (pistols).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA few minutes passed--in by-play--suspense--discussion among the\r\ntribesmen--Robinson's tamed squaws ventured to cross the line and begin\r\npersuasions upon the wild squaws.  Then the chief stepped back \xe2\x80\x9cto confer\r\nwith the old women--the real arbiters of savage war.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Bonwick\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAs the fallen gladiator in the arena looks for the signal of life\r\n     or death from the president of the amphitheatre, so waited our\r\n     friends in anxious suspense while the conference continued.  In a\r\n     few minutes, before a word was uttered, the women of the tribe threw\r\n     up their arms three times.  This was the inviolable sign of peace!\r\n     Down fell the spears.  Forward, with a heavy sigh of relief, and\r\n     upward glance of gratitude, came the friends of peace.  The\r\n     impulsive natives rushed forth with tears and cries, as each saw in\r\n     the other's rank a loved one of the past.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a jubilee of joy.  A festival followed.  And, while tears\r\n     flowed at the recital of woe, a corrobory of pleasant laughter\r\n     closed the eventful day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn four years, without the spilling of a drop of blood, Robinson brought\r\nthem all in, willing captives, and delivered them to the white governor,\r\nand ended the war which powder and bullets, and thousands of men to use\r\nthem, had prosecuted without result since 1804.\r\n\r\nMarsyas charming the wild beasts with his music--that is fable; but the\r\nmiracle wrought by Robinson is fact.  It is history--and authentic; and\r\nsurely, there is nothing greater, nothing more reverence-compelling in\r\nthe history of any country, ancient or modern.\r\n\r\nAnd in memory of the greatest man Australasia ever developed or ever will\r\ndevelop, there is a stately monument to George Augustus Robinson, the\r\nConciliator in--no, it is to another man, I forget his name.\r\n\r\nHowever, Robertson's own generation honored him, and in manifesting it\r\nhonored themselves.  The Government gave him a money-reward and a\r\nthousand acres of land; and the people held mass-meetings and praised him\r\nand emphasized their praise with a large subscription of money.\r\n\r\nA good dramatic situation; but the curtain fell on another:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen this desperate tribe was thus captured, there was much\r\n     surprise to find that the L30,000 of a little earlier day had been\r\n     spent, and the whole population of the colony placed under arms, in\r\n     contention with an opposing force of sixteen men with wooden spears!\r\n     Yet such was the fact.  The celebrated Big River tribe, that had\r\n     been raised by European fears to a host, consisted of sixteen men,\r\n     nine women, and one child.  With a knowledge of the mischief done by\r\n     these few, their wonderful marches and their widespread aggressions,\r\n     their enemies cannot deny to them the attributes of courage and\r\n     military tact.  A Wallace might harass a large army with a small and\r\n     determined band; but the contending parties were at least equal in\r\n     arms and civilization.  The Zulus who fought us in Africa, the\r\n     Maories in New Zealand, the Arabs in the Soudan, were far better\r\n     provided with weapons, more advanced in the science of war, and\r\n     considerably more numerous, than the naked Tasmanians.  Governor\r\n     Arthur rightly termed them a noble race.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThese were indeed wonderful people, the natives.  They ought not to have\r\nbeen wasted.  They should have been crossed with the Whites.  It would\r\nhave improved the Whites and done the Natives no harm.\r\n\r\nBut the Natives were wasted, poor heroic wild creatures.  They were\r\ngathered together in little settlements on neighboring islands, and\r\npaternally cared for by the Government, and instructed in religion, and\r\ndeprived of tobacco, because the superintendent of the Sunday-school was\r\nnot a smoker, and so considered smoking immoral.\r\n\r\nThe Natives were not used to clothes, and houses, and regular hours, and\r\nchurch, and school, and Sunday-school, and work, and the other misplaced\r\npersecutions of civilization, and they pined for their lost home and\r\ntheir wild free life.  Too late they repented that they had traded that\r\nheaven for this hell.  They sat homesick on their alien crags, and day by\r\nday gazed out through their tears over the sea with unappeasable longing\r\ntoward the hazy bulk which was the specter of what had been their\r\nparadise; one by one their hearts broke and they died.\r\n\r\nIn a very few years nothing but a scant remnant remained alive.  A\r\nhandful lingered along into age.  In 1864 the last man died, in 1876 the\r\nlast woman died, and the Spartans of Australasia were extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Whites always mean well when they take human fish out of the ocean\r\nand try to make them dry and warm and happy and comfortable in a chicken\r\ncoop; but the kindest-hearted white man can always be depended on to\r\nprove himself inadequate when he deals with savages.  He cannot turn the\r\nsituation around and imagine how he would like it to have a well-meaning\r\nsavage transfer him from his house and his church and his clothes and his\r\nbooks and his choice food to a hideous wilderness of sand and rocks and\r\nsnow, and ice and sleet and storm and blistering sun, with no shelter, no\r\nbed, no covering for his and his family's naked bodies, and nothing to\r\neat but snakes and grubs and 'offal.  This would be a hell to him; and if\r\nhe had any wisdom he would know that his own civilization is a hell to\r\nthe savage--but he hasn't any, and has never had any; and for lack of it\r\nhe shut up those poor natives in the unimaginable perdition of his\r\ncivilization, committing his crime with the very best intentions, and saw\r\nthose poor creatures waste away under his tortures; and gazed at it,\r\nvaguely troubled and sorrowful, and wondered what could be the matter\r\nwith them.  One is almost betrayed into respecting those criminals, they\r\nwere so sincerely kind, and tender, and humane; and well-meaning.\r\n\r\nThey didn't know why those exiled savages faded away, and they did their\r\nhonest best to reason it out.  And one man, in a like case in New South\r\nWales, did reason it out and arrive at a solution:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt is from the wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven against\r\n     cold ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat settles it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nLet us be thankful for the fools.  But for them the rest of us could not\r\nsucceed.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe aphorism does really seem true: \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the Circumstances, the Man\r\nwill appear.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the man musn't appear ahead of time, or it will spoil\r\neverything.  In Robinson's case the Moment had been approaching for a\r\nquarter of a century--and meantime the future Conciliator was tranquilly\r\nlaying bricks in Hobart.  When all other means had failed, the Moment had\r\narrived, and the Bricklayer put down his trowel and came forward.\r\nEarlier he would have been jeered back to his trowel again.  It reminds\r\nme of a tale that was told me by a Kentuckian on the train when we were\r\ncrossing Montana.  He said the tale was current in Louisville years ago.\r\nHe thought it had been in print, but could not remember.  At any rate, in\r\nsubstance it was this, as nearly as I can call it back to mind.\r\n\r\nA few years before the outbreak of the Civil War it began to appear that\r\nMemphis, Tennessee, was going to be a great tobacco entrepot--the wise\r\ncould see the signs of it.  At that time Memphis had a wharf boat, of\r\ncourse.  There was a paved sloping wharf, for the accommodation of\r\nfreight, but the steamers landed on the outside of the wharfboat, and all\r\nloading and unloading was done across it, between steamer and shore.  A\r\nnumber of wharfboat clerks were needed, and part of the time, every day,\r\nthey were very busy, and part of the time tediously idle.  They were\r\nboiling over with youth and spirits, and they had to make the intervals\r\nof idleness endurable in some way; and as a rule, they did it by\r\ncontriving practical jokes and playing them upon each other.\r\n\r\nThe favorite butt for the jokes was Ed Jackson, because he played none\r\nhimself, and was easy game for other people's--for he always believed\r\nwhatever was told him.\r\n\r\nOne day he told the others his scheme for his holiday.  He was not going\r\nfishing or hunting this time--no, he had thought out a better plan.  Out\r\nof his $40 a month he had saved enough for his purpose, in an economical\r\nway, and he was going to have a look at New York.\r\n\r\nIt was a great and surprising idea.  It meant travel--immense travel--in\r\nthose days it meant seeing the world; it was the equivalent of a voyage\r\naround it in ours.  At first the other youths thought his mind was\r\naffected, but when they found that he was in earnest, the next thing to\r\nbe thought of was, what sort of opportunity this venture might afford for\r\na practical joke.\r\n\r\nThe young men studied over the matter, then held a secret consultation\r\nand made a plan.  The idea was, that one of the conspirators should offer\r\nEd a letter of introduction to Commodore Vanderbilt, and trick him into\r\ndelivering it.  It would be easy to do this.  But what would Ed do when\r\nhe got back to Memphis?  That was a serious matter.  He was good-hearted,\r\nand had always taken the jokes patiently; but they had been jokes which\r\ndid not humiliate him, did not bring him to shame; whereas, this would be\r\na cruel one in that way, and to play it was to meddle with fire; for with\r\nall his good nature, Ed was a Southerner--and the English of that was,\r\nthat when he came back he would kill as many of the conspirators as he\r\ncould before falling himself.  However, the chances must be taken--it\r\nwouldn't do to waste such a joke as that.\r\n\r\nSo the letter was prepared with great care and elaboration.  It was\r\nsigned Alfred Fairchild, and was written in an easy and friendly spirit.\r\nIt stated that the bearer was the bosom friend of the writer's son, and\r\nwas of good parts and sterling character, and it begged the Commodore to\r\nbe kind to the young stranger for the writer's sake.  It went on to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may have forgotten me, in this long stretch of time, but you will\r\neasily call me back out of your boyhood memories when I remind you of how\r\nwe robbed old Stevenson's orchard that night; and how, while he was\r\nchasing down the road after us, we cut across the field and doubled back\r\nand sold his own apples to his own cook for a hat-full of doughnuts; and\r\nthe time that we----\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth and so on, bringing in names of\r\nimaginary comrades, and detailing all sorts of wild and absurd and, of\r\ncourse, wholly imaginary schoolboy pranks and adventures, but putting\r\nthem into lively and telling shape.\r\n\r\nWith all gravity Ed was asked if he would like to have a letter to\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt, the great millionaire.  It was expected that the\r\nquestion would astonish Ed, and it did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?  Do you know that extraordinary man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; but my father does.  They were schoolboys together.  And if you\r\nlike, I'll write and ask father.  I know he'll be glad to give it to you\r\nfor my sake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEd could not find words capable of expressing his gratitude and delight.\r\nThe three days passed, and the letter was put into his bands.  He started\r\non his trip, still pouring out his thanks while he shook good-bye all\r\naround.  And when he was out of sight his comrades let fly their laughter\r\nin a storm of happy satisfaction--and then quieted down, and were less\r\nhappy, less satisfied.  For the old doubts as to the wisdom of this\r\ndeception began to intrude again.\r\n\r\nArrived in New York, Ed found his way to Commodore Vanderbilt's business\r\nquarters, and was ushered into a large anteroom, where a score of people\r\nwere patiently awaiting their turn for a two-minute interview with the\r\nmillionaire in his private office.  A servant asked for Ed's card, and\r\ngot the letter instead.  Ed was sent for a moment later, and found Mr.\r\nVanderbilt alone, with the letter--open--in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray sit down, Mr. --er--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJackson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh--sit down, Mr. Jackson.  By the opening sentences it seems to be a\r\nletter from an old friend.  Allow me--I will run my eye through it.  He\r\nsays he says--why, who is it?\xe2\x80\x9d He turned the sheet and found the\r\nsignature.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlfred Fairchild--hm--Fairchild--I don't recall the name.\r\nBut that is nothing--a thousand names have gone from me.  He says--he\r\nsays-hm-hmoh, dear, but it's good!  Oh, it's rare!  I don't quite\r\nremember it, but I seem to it'll all come back to me presently.  He says\r\n--he says--hm--hm-oh, but that was a game!  Oh, spl-endid!  How it\r\ncarries me back!  It's all dim, of course it's a long time ago--and the\r\nnames--some of the names are wavery and indistinct--but sho', I know it\r\nhappened--I can feel it! and lord, how it warms my heart, and brings\r\nback my lost youth!  Well, well, well, I've got to come back into this\r\nwork-a-day world now--business presses and people are waiting--I'll keep\r\nthe rest for bed to-night, and live my youth over again.  And you'll\r\nthank Fairchild for me when you see him--I used to call him Alf, I think\r\n--and you'll give him my gratitude for--what this letter has done for the\r\ntired spirit of a hard-worked man; and tell him there isn't anything that\r\nI can do for him or any friend of his that I won't do.  And as for you,\r\nmy lad, you are my guest; you can't stop at any hotel in New York.  Sit.\r\nwhere you are a little while, till I get through with these people, then\r\nwe'll go home.  I'll take care of you, my boy--make yourself easy as to\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEd stayed a week, and had an immense time--and never suspected that the\r\nCommodore's shrewd eye was on him, and that he was daily being weighed\r\nand measured and analyzed and tried and tested.\r\n\r\nYes, he had an immense time; and never wrote home, but saved it all up to\r\ntell when he should get back.  Twice, with proper modesty and decency, he\r\nproposed to end his visit, but the Commodore said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo--wait; leave it to\r\nme; I'll tell you when to go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those days the Commodore was making some of those vast combinations of\r\nhis--consolidations of warring odds and ends of railroads into harmonious\r\nsystems, and concentrations of floating and rudderless commerce in\r\neffective centers--and among other things his farseeing eye had detected\r\nthe convergence of that huge tobacco-commerce, already spoken of, toward\r\nMemphis, and he had resolved to set his grasp upon it and make it his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe week came to an end.  Then the Commodore said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you can start home.  But first we will have some more talk about\r\nthat tobacco matter.  I know you now.  I know your abilities as well as\r\nyou know them yourself--perhaps better.  You understand that tobacco\r\nmatter; you understand that I am going to take possession of it, and you\r\nalso understand the plans which I have matured for doing it.  What I want\r\nis a man who knows my mind, and is qualified to represent me in Memphis,\r\nand be in supreme command of that important business--and I appoint you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.  Your salary will be high--of course-for you are representing me.\r\nLater you will earn increases of it, and will get them.  You will need a\r\nsmall army of assistants; choose them yourself--and carefully.  Take no\r\nman for friendship's sake; but, all things being equal, take the man you\r\nknow, take your friend, in preference to the stranger.\xe2\x80\x9d  After some\r\nfurther talk under this head, the Commodore said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, my boy, and thank Alf for me, for sending you to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen Ed reached Memphis he rushed down to the wharf in a fever to tell\r\nhis great news and thank the boys over and over again for thinking to\r\ngive him the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt.  It happened to be one of those\r\nidle times.  Blazing hot noonday, and no sign of life on the wharf.  But\r\nas Ed threaded his way among the freight piles, he saw a white linen\r\nfigure stretched in slumber upon a pile of grain-sacks under an awning,\r\nand said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThat's one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d and hastened his step; next,\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt's Charley--it's Fairchild good\xe2\x80\x9d; and the next moment laid an\r\naffectionate hand on the sleeper's shoulder.  The eyes opened lazily,\r\ntook one glance, the face blanched, the form whirled itself from the\r\nsack-pile, and in an instant Ed was alone and Fairchild was flying for\r\nthe wharf-boat like the wind!\r\n\r\nEd was dazed, stupefied.  Was Fairchild crazy?  What could be the meaning\r\nof this?  He started slow and dreamily down toward the wharf-boat; turned\r\nthe corner of a freight-pile and came suddenly upon two of the boys.\r\nThey were lightly laughing over some pleasant matter; they heard his\r\nstep, and glanced up just as he discovered them; the laugh died abruptly;\r\nand before Ed could speak they were off, and sailing over barrels and\r\nbales like hunted deer.  Again Ed was paralyzed.  Had the boys all gone\r\nmad?  What could be the explanation of this extraordinary conduct?  And\r\nso, dreaming along, he reached the wharf-boat, and stepped aboard--\r\nnothing\r\nbut silence there, and vacancy.  He crossed the deck, turned the corner\r\nto go down the outer guard, heard a fervent--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO lord!\xe2\x80\x9d and saw a white linen form plunge overboard.\r\n\r\nThe youth came up coughing and strangling, and cried out--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo 'way from here!  You let me alone.  I didn't do it, I swear I\r\ndidn't!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn't do what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive you the----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what you didn't do--come out of that!  What makes you all act\r\nso?  What have I done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?  Why you haven't done anything.  But----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what have you got against me?  What do you all treat me so\r\nfor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--er--but haven't you got anything against us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course not.  What put such a thing into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonor bright--you haven't?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHonor bright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwear it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know what in the world you mean, but I swear it, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you'll shake hands with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows I'll be glad to!  Why, I'm just starving to shake hands\r\nwith somebody!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe swimmer muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cHang him, he smelt a rat and never delivered the\r\nletter!--but it's all right, I'm not going to fetch up the subject.\xe2\x80\x9d  And\r\nhe crawled out and came dripping and draining to shake hands.  First one\r\nand then another of the conspirators showed up cautiously--armed to the\r\nteeth--took in the amicable situation, then ventured warily forward and\r\njoined the love-feast.\r\n\r\nAnd to Ed's eager inquiry as to what made them act as they had been\r\nacting, they answered evasively, and pretended that they had put it up as\r\na joke, to see what he would do.  It was the best explanation they could\r\ninvent at such short notice.  And each said to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cHe never\r\ndelivered that letter, and the joke is on us, if he only knew it or we\r\nwere dull enough to come out and tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, of course, they wanted to know all about the trip; and he said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome right up on the boiler deck and order the drinks--it's my treat.\r\nI'm going to tell you all about it.  And to-night it's my treat again\r\n--and we'll have oysters and a time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the drinks were brought and cigars lighted, Ed said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when I delivered the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGreat Scott!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious, how you scared me.  What's the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh--er--nothing.  Nothing--it was a tack in the chair-seat,\xe2\x80\x9d said one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you all said it.  However, no matter.  When I delivered the\r\nletter----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you deliver it?\xe2\x80\x9d  And they looked at each other as people might who\r\nthought that maybe they were dreaming.\r\n\r\nThen they settled to listening; and as the story deepened and its marvels\r\ngrew, the amazement of it made them dumb, and the interest of it took\r\ntheir breath.  They hardly uttered a whisper during two hours, but sat\r\nlike petrifactions and drank in the immortal romance.  At last the tale\r\nwas ended, and Ed said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it's all owing to you, boys, and you'll never find me ungrateful\r\n--bless your hearts, the best friends a fellow ever had!  You'll all have\r\nplaces; I want every one of you.  I know you--I know you 'by the back,'\r\nas the gamblers say.  You're jokers, and all that, but you're sterling,\r\nwith the hallmark on.  And Charley Fairchild, you shall be my first\r\nassistant and right hand, because of your first-class ability, and\r\nbecause you got me the letter, and for your father's sake who wrote it\r\nfor me, and to please Mr. Vanderbilt, who said it would!  And here's to\r\nthat great man--drink hearty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, when the Moment comes, the Man appears--even if he is a thousand\r\nmiles away, and has to be discovered by a practical joke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nWhen people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down in\r\nhis private heart no man much respects himself.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, the human interest is the first interest in the log-book of\r\nany country.  The annals of Tasmania, in whose shadow we were sailing,\r\nare lurid with that feature.  Tasmania was a convict-dump, in old times;\r\nthis has been indicated in the account of the Conciliator, where\r\nreference is made to vain attempts of desperate convicts to win to\r\npermanent freedom, after escaping from Macquarrie Harbor and the \xe2\x80\x9cGates\r\nof Hell.\xe2\x80\x9d In the early days Tasmania had a great population of convicts,\r\nof both sexes and all ages, and a bitter hard life they had.  In one spot\r\nthere was a settlement of juvenile convicts--children--who had been sent\r\nthither from their home and their friends on the other side of the globe\r\nto expiate their \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn due course our ship entered the estuary called the Derwent, at whose\r\nhead stands Hobart, the capital of Tasmania.  The Derwent's shores\r\nfurnish scenery of an interesting sort.  The historian Laurie, whose\r\nbook, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Story of Australasia,\xe2\x80\x9d is just out, invoices its features with\r\nconsiderable truth and intemperance: \xe2\x80\x9cThe marvelous picturesqueness of\r\nevery point of view, combined with the clear balmy atmosphere and the\r\ntransparency of the ocean depths, must have delighted and deeply\r\nimpressed\xe2\x80\x9d the early explorers.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf the rock-bound coasts, sullen,\r\ndefiant, and lowering, seemed uninviting, these were occasionally broken\r\ninto charmingly alluring coves floored with golden sand, clad with\r\nevergreen shrubbery, and adorned with every variety of indigenous wattle,\r\nshe-oak, wild flower, and fern, from the delicately graceful\r\n'maiden-hair' to the palm-like 'old man'; while the majestic gum-tree,\r\nclean and smooth as the mast of 'some tall ammiral' pierces the clear air\r\nto the height of 230 feet or more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt looked so to me.  \xe2\x80\x9cCoasting along Tasman's Peninsula, what a shock of\r\npleasant wonder must have struck the early mariner on suddenly sighting\r\nCape Pillar, with its cluster of black-ribbed basaltic columns rising to\r\na height of 900 feet, the hydra head wreathed in a turban of fleecy\r\ncloud, the base lashed by jealous waves spouting angry fountains of\r\nfoam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is well enough, but I did not suppose those snags were 900 feet\r\nhigh.  Still they were a very fine show.  They stood boldly out by\r\nthemselves, and made a fascinatingly odd spectacle.  But there was\r\nnothing about their appearance to suggest the heads of a hydra.  They\r\nlooked like a row of lofty slabs with their upper ends tapered to the\r\nshape of a carving-knife point; in fact, the early voyager, ignorant of\r\ntheir great height, might have mistaken them for a rusty old rank of\r\npiles that had sagged this way and that out of the perpendicular.\r\n\r\nThe Peninsula is lofty, rocky, and densely clothed with scrub, or brush,\r\nor both.  It is joined to the main by a low neck.  At this junction was\r\nformerly a convict station called Port Arthur--a place hard to escape\r\nfrom.  Behind it was the wilderness of scrub, in which a fugitive would\r\nsoon starve; in front was the narrow neck, with a cordon of chained dogs\r\nacross it, and a line of lanterns, and a fence of living guards, armed.\r\nWe saw the place as we swept by--that is, we had a glimpse of what we\r\nwere told was the entrance to Port Arthur.  The glimpse was worth\r\nsomething, as a remembrancer, but that was all.\r\n\r\nThe voyage thence up the Derwent Frith displays a grand succession of\r\nfairy visions, in its entire length elsewhere unequaled.  In gliding over\r\nthe deep blue sea studded with lovely islets luxuriant to the water's\r\nedge, one is at a loss which scene to choose for contemplation and to\r\nadmire most.  When the Huon and Bruni have been passed, there seems no\r\npossible chance of a rival; but suddenly Mount Wellington, massive and\r\nnoble like his brother Etna, literally heaves in sight, sternly guarded\r\non either hand by Mounts Nelson and Rumney; presently we arrive at\r\nSullivan's Cove--Hobart!\r\n\r\nIt is an attractive town.  It sits on low hills that slope to the harbor\r\n--a harbor that looks like a river, and is as smooth as one.  Its still\r\nsurface is pictured with dainty reflections of boats and grassy banks and\r\nluxuriant foliage.  Back of the town rise highlands that are clothed in\r\nwoodland loveliness, and over the way is that noble mountain, Wellington,\r\na stately bulk, a most majestic pile.  How beautiful is the whole region,\r\nfor form, and grouping, and opulence, and freshness of foliage, and\r\nvariety of color, and grace and shapeliness of the hills, the capes, the\r\npromontories; and then, the splendor of the sunlight, the dim rich\r\ndistances, the charm of the water-glimpses!  And it was in this paradise\r\nthat the yellow-liveried convicts were landed, and the Corps-bandits\r\nquartered, and the wanton slaughter of the kangaroo-chasing black\r\ninnocents consummated on that autumn day in May, in the brutish old time.\r\nIt was all out of keeping with the place, a sort of bringing of heaven\r\nand hell together.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of this paradise reminds me that it was at Hobart that we\r\nstruck the head of the procession of Junior Englands.  We were to\r\nencounter other sections of it in New Zealand, presently, and others\r\nlater in Natal.  Wherever the exiled Englishman can find in his new home\r\nresemblances to his old one, he is touched to the marrow of his being;\r\nthe love that is in his heart inspires his imagination, and these allied\r\nforces transfigure those resemblances into authentic duplicates of the\r\nrevered originals.  It is beautiful, the feeling which works this\r\nenchantment, and it compels one's homage; compels it, and also compels\r\none's assent--compels it always--even when, as happens sometimes, one\r\ndoes not see the resemblances as clearly as does the exile who is\r\npointing them out.\r\n\r\nThe resemblances do exist, it is quite true; and often they cunningly\r\napproximate the originals--but after all, in the matter of certain\r\nphysical patent rights there is only one England.  Now that I have\r\nsampled the globe, I am not in doubt.  There is a beauty of Switzerland,\r\nand it is repeated in the glaciers and snowy ranges of many parts of the\r\nearth; there is a beauty of the fiord, and it is repeated in New Zealand\r\nand Alaska; there is a beauty of Hawaii, and it is repeated in ten\r\nthousand islands of the Southern seas; there is a beauty of the prairie\r\nand the plain, and it is repeated here and there in the earth; each of\r\nthese is worshipful, each is perfect in its way, yet holds no monopoly of\r\nits beauty; but that beauty which is England is alone--it has no\r\nduplicate.\r\n\r\nIt is made up of very simple details--just grass, and trees, and shrubs,\r\nand roads, and hedges, and gardens, and houses, and vines, and churches,\r\nand castles, and here and there a ruin--and over it all a mellow\r\ndream-haze of history.  But its beauty is incomparable, and all its own.\r\n\r\nHobart has a peculiarity--it is the neatest town that the sun shines on;\r\nand I incline to believe that it is also the cleanest.  However that may\r\nbe, its supremacy in neatness is not to be questioned.  There cannot be\r\nanother town in the world that has no shabby exteriors; no rickety gates\r\nand fences, no neglected houses crumbling to ruin, no crazy and unsightly\r\nsheds, no weed-grown front-yards of the poor, no back-yards littered with\r\ntin cans and old boots and empty bottles, no rubbish in the gutters, no\r\nclutter on the sidewalks, no outer-borders fraying out into dirty lanes\r\nand tin-patched huts.  No, in Hobart all the aspects are tidy, and all a\r\ncomfort to the eye; the modestest cottage looks combed and brushed, and\r\nhas its vines, its flowers, its neat fence, its neat gate, its comely cat\r\nasleep on the window ledge.\r\n\r\nWe had a glimpse of the museum, by courtesy of the American gentleman who\r\nis curator of it.  It has samples of half-a-dozen different kinds of\r\nmarsupials--[A marsupial is a plantigrade vertebrate whose specialty is\r\nits pocket.  In some countries it is extinct, in the others it is rare.\r\nThe first American marsupials were Stephen Girard, Mr. Astor and the\r\nopossum; the principal marsupials of the Southern Hemisphere are Mr.\r\nRhodes, and the kangaroo.  I, myself, am the latest marsupial.  Also, I\r\nmight boast that I have the largest pocket of them all.  But there is\r\nnothing in that.]--one, the \xe2\x80\x9cTasmanian devil;\xe2\x80\x9d that is, I think he was\r\none of them.  And there was a fish with lungs.  When the water dries up\r\nit can live in the mud.  Most curious of all was a parrot that kills\r\nsheep.  On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand sheep in a\r\nwhole year.  He doesn't want the whole sheep, but only the kidney-fat.\r\nThis restricted taste makes him an expensive bird to support.  To get the\r\nfat he drives his beak in and rips it out; the wound is mortal.  This\r\nparrot furnishes a notable example of evolution brought about by changed\r\nconditions.  When the sheep culture was introduced, it presently brought\r\nfamine to the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub which had always\r\nthitherto been the parrot's diet.  The miseries of hunger made the bird\r\nwilling to eat raw flesh, since it could get no other food, and it began\r\nto pick remnants of meat from sheep skins hung out on the fences to dry.\r\nIt soon came to prefer sheep meat to any other food, and by and by it\r\ncame to prefer the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep.  The\r\nparrot's bill was not well shaped for digging out the fat, but Nature\r\nfixed that matter; she altered the bill's shape, and now the parrot can\r\ndig out kidney-fat better than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, or\r\nanybody else, for that matter--even an Admiral.\r\n\r\nAnd there was another curiosity--quite a stunning one, I thought:\r\nArrow-heads and knives just like those which Primeval Man made out of\r\nflint, and thought he had done such a wonderful thing--yes, and has been\r\nhumored and coddled in that superstition by this age of admiring\r\nscientists until there is probably no living with him in the other world\r\nby now.  Yet here is his finest and nicest work exactly duplicated in our\r\nday; and by people who have never heard of him or his works: by\r\naborigines who lived in the islands of these seas, within our time.  And\r\nthey not only duplicated those works of art but did it in the brittlest\r\nand most treacherous of substances--glass: made them out of old brandy\r\nbottles flung out of the British camps; millions of tons of them.  It is\r\ntime for Primeval Man to make a little less noise, now.  He has had his\r\nday.  He is not what he used to be.  We had a drive through a bloomy and\r\nodorous fairy-land, to the Refuge for the Indigent--a spacious and\r\ncomfortable home, with hospitals, etc., for both sexes.  There was a\r\ncrowd there, of the oldest people I have ever seen.  It was like being\r\nsuddenly set down in a new world--a weird world where Youth has never\r\nbeen, a world sacred to Age, and bowed forms, and wrinkles.  Out of the\r\n359 persons present, 223 were ex-convicts, and could have told stirring\r\ntales, no doubt, if they had been minded to talk; 42 of the 359 were past\r\n80, and several were close upon 90; the average age at death there is 76\r\nyears. As for me, I have no use for that place; it is too healthy.\r\nSeventy is old enough--after that, there is too much risk.  Youth and\r\ngaiety might vanish, any day--and then, what is left?  Death in life;\r\ndeath without its privileges, death without its benefits.  There were 185\r\nwomen in that Refuge, and 81 of them were ex-convicts.\r\n\r\nThe steamer disappointed us.  Instead of making a long visit at Hobart,\r\nas usual, she made a short one.  So we got but a glimpse of Tasmania, and\r\nthen moved on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nNature makes the locust with an appetite for crops; man would have made\r\nhim with an appetite for sand.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWe spent part of an afternoon and a night at sea, and reached Bluff, in\r\nNew Zealand, early in the morning.  Bluff is at the bottom of the middle\r\nisland, and is away down south, nearly fort y-seven degrees below the\r\nequator.  It lies as far south of the line as Quebec lies north of it,\r\nand the climates of the two should be alike; but for some reason or other\r\nit has not been so arranged.  Quebec is hot in the summer and cold in the\r\nwinter, but Bluff's climate is less intense; the cold weather is not very\r\ncold, the hot weather is not very hot; and the difference between the\r\nhottest month and the coldest is but 17 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand the rabbit plague began at Bluff.  The man who introduced\r\nthe rabbit there was banqueted and lauded; but they would hang him, now,\r\nif they could get him. In England the natural enemy of the rabbit is\r\ndetested and persecuted; in the Bluff region the natural enemy of the\r\nrabbit is honored, and his person is sacred.  The rabbit's natural enemy\r\nin England is the poacher, in Bluff its natural enemy is the stoat, the\r\nweasel, the ferret, the cat, and the mongoose.  In England any person\r\nbelow the Heir who is caught with a rabbit in his possession must\r\nsatisfactorily explain how it got there, or he will suffer fine and\r\nimprisonment, together with extinction of his peerage; in Bluff, the cat\r\nfound with a rabbit in its possession does not have to explain--everybody\r\nlooks the other way; the person caught noticing would suffer fine and\r\nimprisonment, with extinction of peerage.  This is a sure way to\r\nundermine the moral fabric of a cat.  Thirty years from now there will\r\nnot be a moral cat in New Zealand.  Some think there is none there now.\r\nIn England the poacher is watched, tracked, hunted--he dare not show his\r\nface; in Bluff the cat, the weasel, the stoat, and the mongoose go up and\r\ndown, whither they will, unmolested.  By a law of the legislature, posted\r\nwhere all may read, it is decreed that any person found in possession of\r\none of these creatures (dead) must satisfactorily explain the\r\ncircumstances or pay a fine of not less than L5, nor more than L20.  The\r\nrevenue from this source is not large.  Persons who want to pay a hundred\r\ndollars for a dead cat are getting rarer and rarer every day.  This is\r\nbad, for the revenue was to go to the endowment of a University.  All\r\ngovernments are more or less short-sighted: in England they fine the\r\npoacher, whereas he ought to be banished to New Zealand.  New Zealand\r\nwould pay his way, and give him wages.\r\n\r\nIt was from Bluff that we ought to have cut across to the west coast and\r\nvisited the New Zealand Switzerland, a land of superb scenery, made up of\r\nsnowy grandeurs, anal mighty glaciers, and beautiful lakes; and over\r\nthere, also, are the wonderful rivals of the Norwegian and Alaskan\r\nfiords; and for neighbor, a waterfall of 1,900 feet; but we were obliged\r\nto postpone the trip to some later and indefinite time.\r\n\r\nNovember 6.  A lovely summer morning; brilliant blue sky.  A few miles\r\nout from Invercargill, passed through vast level green expanses snowed\r\nover with sheep.  Fine to see.  The green, deep and very vivid sometimes;\r\nat other times less so, but delicate and lovely.  A passenger reminds me\r\nthat I am in \xe2\x80\x9cthe England of the Far South.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDunedin, same date.  The town justifies Michael Davitt's praises.\r\nThe people are Scotch.  They stopped here on their way from home to\r\nheaven-thinking they had arrived.  The population is stated at 40,000, by\r\nMalcolm Ross, journalist; stated by an M. P. at 60,000.  A journalist\r\ncannot lie.\r\n\r\nTo the residence of Dr. Hockin.  He has a fine collection of books\r\nrelating to New Zealand; and his house is a museum of Maori art and\r\nantiquities.  He has pictures and prints in color of many native chiefs\r\nof the past--some of them of note in history.  There is nothing of the\r\nsavage in the faces; nothing could be finer than these men's features,\r\nnothing more intellectual than these faces, nothing more masculine,\r\nnothing nobler than their aspect.  The aboriginals of Australia and\r\nTasmania looked the savage, but these chiefs looked like Roman\r\npatricians.  The tattooing in these portraits ought to suggest the\r\nsavage, of course, but it does not.  The designs are so flowing and\r\ngraceful and beautiful that they are a most satisfactory decoration.  It\r\ntakes but fifteen minutes to get reconciled to the tattooing, and but\r\nfifteen more to perceive that it is just the thing.  After that, the\r\nundecorated European face is unpleasant and ignoble.\r\n\r\nDr. Hockin gave us a ghastly curiosity--a lignified caterpillar with a\r\nplant growing out of the back of its neck--a plant with a slender stem 4\r\ninches high.  It happened not by accident, but by design--Nature's\r\ndesign.  This caterpillar was in the act of loyally carrying out a law\r\ninflicted upon him by Nature--a law purposely inflicted upon him to get\r\nhim into trouble--a law which was a trap; in pursuance of this law he\r\nmade the proper preparations for turning himself into a night-moth; that\r\nis to say, he dug a little trench, a little grave, and then stretched\r\nhimself out in it on his stomach and partially buried himself--then\r\nNature was ready for him.  She blew the spores of a peculiar fungus\r\nthrough the air with a purpose.  Some of them fell into a crease in the\r\nback of the caterpillar's neck, and began to sprout and grow--for there\r\nwas soil there--he had not washed his neck.  The roots forced themselves\r\ndown into the worm's person, and rearward along through its body, sucking\r\nup the creature's juices for sap; the worm slowly died, and turned to\r\nwood.  And here he was now, a wooden caterpillar, with every detail of\r\nhis former physique delicately and exactly preserved and perpetuated, and\r\nwith that stem standing up out of him for his monument--monument\r\ncommemorative of his own loyalty and of Nature's unfair return for it.\r\n\r\nNature is always acting like that.  Mrs. X. said (of course) that the\r\ncaterpillar was not conscious and didn't suffer.  She should have known\r\nbetter.  No caterpillar can deceive Nature.  If this one couldn't suffer,\r\nNature would have known it and would have hunted up another caterpillar.\r\nNot that she would have let this one go, merely because it was defective.\r\nNo.  She would have waited and let him turn into a night-moth; and then\r\nfried him in the candle.\r\n\r\nNature cakes a fish's eyes over with parasites, so that it shan't be able\r\nto avoid its enemies or find its food.  She sends parasites into a\r\nstar-fish's system, which clog up its prongs and swell them and make them\r\nso uncomfortable that the poor creature delivers itself from the prong to\r\nease its misery; and presently it has to part with another prong for the\r\nsake of comfort, and finally with a third.  If it re-grows the prongs,\r\nthe parasite returns and the same thing is repeated.  And finally, when\r\nthe ability to reproduce prongs is lost through age, that poor old\r\nstar-fish can't get around any more, and so it dies of starvation.\r\n\r\nIn Australia is prevalent a horrible disease due to an \xe2\x80\x9cunperfected\r\ntapeworm.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unperfected--that is what they call it, I do not know why,\r\nfor it transacts business just as well as if it were finished and\r\nfrescoed and gilded, and all that.\r\n\r\nNovember 9.  To the museum and public picture gallery with the president\r\nof the Society of Artists.  Some fine pictures there, lent by the S. of\r\nA. several of them they bought, the others came to them by gift.  Next,\r\nto the gallery of the S. of A.--annual exhibition--just opened.  Fine.\r\nThink of a town like this having two such collections as this, and a\r\nSociety of Artists.  It is so all over Australasia.  If it were a\r\nmonarchy one might understand it.  I mean an absolute monarchy, where it\r\nisn't necessary to vote money, but take it.  Then art flourishes.  But\r\nthese colonies are republics--republics with a wide suffrage; voters of\r\nboth sexes, this one of New Zealand.  In republics, neither the\r\ngovernment nor the rich private citizen is much given to propagating art.\r\nAll over Australasia pictures by famous European artists are bought for\r\nthe public galleries by the State and by societies of citizens.  Living\r\ncitizens--not dead ones.  They rob themselves to give, not their heirs.\r\nThis S. of A. here owns its building--built it by subscription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of wrath--not the words--is the sin; and the spirit of wrath\r\nis cursing.  We begin to swear before we can talk.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nNovember 11.  On the road.  This train-express goes twenty and one-half\r\nmiles an hour, schedule time; but it is fast enough, the outlook upon sea\r\nand land is so interesting, and the cars so comfortable.  They are not\r\nEnglish, and not American; they are the Swiss combination of the two.\r\nA narrow and railed porch along the side, where a person can walk\r\nup and down.  A lavatory in each car.  This is progress; this is\r\nnineteenth-century spirit. In New Zealand, these fast expresses run twice\r\na week. It is well to know this if you want to be a bird and fly through\r\nthe country at a 20-mile gait; otherwise you may start on one of the five\r\nwrong days, and then you will get a train that can't overtake its own\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, these pleasant cars call to mind the branch-road cars at\r\nMaryborough, Australia, and the passengers' talk about the branch-road\r\nand the hotel.\r\n\r\nSomewhere on the road to Maryborough I changed for a while to a\r\nsmoking-carriage.  There were two gentlemen there; both riding backward,\r\none at each end of the compartment.  They were acquaintances of each\r\nother.  I sat down facing the one that sat at the starboard window.  He\r\nhad a good face, and a friendly look, and I judged from his dress that he\r\nwas a dissenting minister.  He was along toward fifty.  Of his own motion\r\nhe struck a match, and shaded it with his hand for me to light my cigar.\r\nI take the rest from my diary:\r\n\r\nIn order to start conversation I asked him something about Maryborough.\r\nHe said, in a most pleasant--even musical voice, but with quiet and\r\ncultured decision:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a charming town, with a hell of a hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was astonished.  It seemed so odd to hear a minister swear out loud.\r\nHe went placidly on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's the worst hotel in Australia.  Well, one may go further, and say in\r\nAustralasia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad beds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--none at all.  Just sand-bags.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pillows, too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the pillows, too.  Just sand.  And not a good quality of sand.  It\r\npacks too hard, and has never been screened.  There is too much gravel in\r\nit.  It is like sleeping on nuts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn't there any good sand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlenty of it.  There is as good bed-sand in this region as the world can\r\nfurnish.  Aerated sand--and loose; but they won't buy it.  They want\r\nsomething that will pack solid, and petrify.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are the rooms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEight feet square; and a sheet of iced oil-cloth to step on in the\r\nmorning when you get out of the sand-quarry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to lights?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoal-oil lamp.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  It's the kind that sheds a gloom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like a lamp that burns all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis one won't.  You must blow it out early.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is bad.  One might want it again in the night.  Can't find it in\r\nthe dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's no trouble; you can find it by the stench.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWardrobe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo nails on the door to hang seven suits of clothes on if you've got\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBells?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere aren't any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you do when you want service?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShout.  But it won't fetch anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose you want the chambermaid to empty the slopjar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn't any slop-jar.  The hotels don't keep them.  That is, outside\r\nof Sydney and Melbourne.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I knew that.  I was only talking.  It's the oddest thing in\r\nAustralia.  Another thing: I've got to get up in the dark, in the\r\nmorning, to take the 5 o'clock train.  Now if the boots----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn't any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the porter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn't any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who will call me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody.  You'll call yourself.  And you'll light yourself, too.\r\nThere'll not be a light burning in the halls or anywhere.  And if you\r\ndon't carry a light, you'll break your neck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut who will help me down with my baggage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNobody.  However, I will tell you what to do.  In Maryborough there's an\r\nAmerican who has lived there half a lifetime; a fine man, and prosperous\r\nand popular.  He will be on the lookout for you; you won't have any\r\ntrouble.  Sleep in peace; he will rout you out, and you will make your\r\ntrain.  Where is your manager?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him at Ballarat, studying the language.  And besides, he had to\r\ngo to Melbourne and get us ready for New Zealand.  I've not tried to\r\npilot myself before, and it doesn't look easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEasy!  You've selected the very most difficult piece of railroad in\r\nAustralia for your experiment.  There are twelve miles of this road which\r\nno man without good executive ability can ever hope--tell me, have you\r\ngood executive ability? first-rate executive ability?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--well, I think so, but----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat settles it.  The tone of----oh, you wouldn't ever make it in the\r\nworld.  However, that American will point you right, and you'll go.\r\nYou've got tickets?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--round trip; all the way to Sydney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, there it is, you see!  You are going in the 5 o'clock by\r\nCastlemaine--twelve miles--instead of the 7.15 by Ballarat--in order to\r\nsave two hours of fooling along the road.  Now then, don't interrupt--let\r\nme have the floor.  You're going to save the government a deal of\r\nhauling, but that's nothing; your ticket is by Ballarat, and it isn't\r\ngood over that twelve miles, and so----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why should the government care which way I go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows!  Ask of the winds that far away with fragments strewed\r\nthe sea, as the boy that stood on the burning deck used to say.  The\r\ngovernment chooses to do its railway business in its own way, and it\r\ndoesn't know as much about it as the French.  In the beginning they tried\r\nidiots; then they imported the French--which was going backwards, you\r\nsee; now it runs the roads itself--which is going backwards again, you\r\nsee.  Why, do you know, in order to curry favor with the voters, the\r\ngovernment puts down a road wherever anybody wants it--anybody that owns\r\ntwo sheep and a dog; and by consequence we've got, in the colony of\r\nVictoria, 800 railway stations, and the business done at eighty of them\r\ndoesn't foot up twenty shillings a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive dollars?  Oh, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's true.  It's the absolute truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there are three or four men on wages at every station.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it.  And the station-business doesn't pay for the sheep-dip to\r\nsanctify their coffee with.  It's just as I say.  And accommodating?\r\nWhy, if you shake a rag the train will stop in the midst of the\r\nwilderness to pick you up.  All that kind of politics costs, you see.\r\nAnd then, besides, any town that has a good many votes and wants a fine\r\nstation, gets it.  Don't you overlook that Maryborough station, if you\r\ntake an interest in governmental curiosities.  Why, you can put the whole\r\npopulation of Maryborough into it, and give them a sofa apiece, and have\r\nroom for more.  You haven't fifteen stations in America that are as big,\r\nand you probably haven't five that are half as fine.  Why, it's\r\nperfectly elegant.  And the clock!  Everybody will show you the clock.\r\nThere isn't a station in Europe that's got such a clock.  It doesn't\r\nstrike--and that's one mercy.  It hasn't any bell; and as you'll have\r\ncause to remember, if you keep your reason, all Australia is simply\r\nbedamned with bells.  On every quarter-hour, night and day, they jingle a\r\ntiresome chime of half a dozen notes--all the clocks in town at once, all\r\nthe clocks in Australasia at once, and all the very same notes; first,\r\ndownward scale: mi, re, do, sol--then upward scale: sol, si, re, do--down\r\nagain: mi, re, do, sol--up again: sol, si, re, do--then the clock--say at\r\nmidnight clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang--clang\r\n--clang--clang--clang----and, by that time you're--hello, what's all this\r\nexcitement about? Oh I see--a runaway--scared by the train; why, you\r\nwouldn't think this train could scare anything.  Well, of course, when\r\nthey build\r\nand run eighty stations at a loss and a lot of palace-stations and clocks\r\nlike Maryborough's at another loss, the government has got to economize\r\nsomewhere hasn't it?  Very well look at the rolling stock.  That's where\r\nthey save the money.  Why, that train from Maryborough will consist of\r\neighteen freight-cars and two passenger-kennels; cheap, poor, shabby,\r\nslovenly; no drinking water,\r\nno sanitary arrangements, every imaginable inconvenience; and slow?--oh,\r\nthe\r\ngait of cold molasses; no air-brake, no springs, and they'll jolt your\r\nhead off every time they start or stop.  That's where they make their\r\nlittle economies, you see.  They spend tons of money to house you\r\npalatially while you wait fifteen minutes for a train, then degrade you\r\nto six hours' convict-transportation to get the foolish outlay back.\r\nWhat a rational man really needs is discomfort while he's waiting, then\r\nhis journey in a nice train would be a grateful change.  But no, that\r\nwould be common sense--and out of place in a government.  And then,\r\nbesides, they save in that other little detail, you know--repudiate their\r\nown tickets, and collect a poor little illegitimate extra shilling out of\r\nyou for that twelve miles, and----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, in any case----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait--there's more.  Leave that American out of the account and see what\r\nwould happen.  There's nobody on hand to examine your ticket when you\r\narrive.  But the conductor will come and examine it when the train is\r\nready to start.  It is too late to buy your extra ticket now; the train\r\ncan't wait, and won't.  You must climb out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut can't I pay the conductor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, he is not authorized to receive the money, and he won't.  You must\r\nclimb out.  There's no other way.  I tell you, the railway management is\r\nabout the only thoroughly European thing here--continentally European I\r\nmean, not English.  It's the continental business in perfection; down\r\nfine.  Oh, yes, even to the peanut-commerce of weighing baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train slowed up at his place.  As he stepped out he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you'll like Maryborough.  Plenty of intelligence there.  It's a\r\ncharming place--with a hell of a hotel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he was gone.  I turned to the other gentleman:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your friend in the ministry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--studying for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nThe man with a new idea is a Crank until the idea succeeds.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nIt was Junior England all the way to Christchurch--in fact, just a\r\ngarden.  And Christchurch is an English town, with an English-park annex,\r\nand a winding English brook just like the Avon--and named the Avon; but\r\nfrom a man, not from Shakespeare's river.  Its grassy banks are bordered\r\nby the stateliest and most impressive weeping willows to be found in the\r\nworld, I suppose.  They continue the line of a great ancestor; they were\r\ngrown from sprouts of the willow that sheltered Napoleon's grave in St.\r\nHelena.  It is a settled old community, with all the serenities, the\r\ngraces, the conveniences, and the comforts of the ideal home-life.  If it\r\nhad an established Church and social inequality it would be England over\r\nagain with hardly a lack.\r\n\r\nIn the museum we saw many curious and interesting things; among others a\r\nfine native house of the olden time, with all the details true to the\r\nfacts, and the showy colors right and in their proper places.  All the\r\ndetails: the fine mats and rugs and things; the elaborate and wonderful\r\nwood carvings--wonderful, surely, considering who did them--wonderful in\r\ndesign and particularly in execution, for they were done with admirable\r\nsharpness and exactness, and yet with no better tools than flint and jade\r\nand shell could furnish; and the totem-posts were there, ancestor above\r\nancestor, with tongues protruded and hands clasped comfortably over\r\nbellies containing other people's ancestors--grotesque and ugly devils,\r\nevery one, but lovingly carved, and ably; and the stuffed natives were\r\npresent, in their proper places, and looking as natural as life; and the\r\nhousekeeping utensils were there, too, and close at hand the carved and\r\nfinely ornamented war canoe.\r\n\r\nAnd we saw little jade gods, to hang around the neck--not everybody's,\r\nbut sacred to the necks of natives of rank.  Also jade weapons, and many\r\nkinds of jade trinkets--all made out of that excessively hard stone\r\nwithout the help of any tool of iron.  And some of these things had small\r\nround holes bored through them--nobody knows how it was done; a mystery,\r\na lost art.  I think it was said that if you want such a hole bored in a\r\npiece of jade now, you must send it to London or Amsterdam where the\r\nlapidaries are.\r\n\r\nAlso we saw a complete skeleton of the giant Moa.  It stood ten feet\r\nhigh, and must have been a sight to look at when it was a living  bird.\r\nIt was a kicker, like the ostrich; in fight it did not use its beak, but\r\nits foot.  It must have been a convincing kind of kick.  If a person had\r\nhis back to the bird and did not see who it was that did it, he would\r\nthink he had been kicked by a wind-mill.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a sufficiency of moas in the old forgotten days when\r\nhis breed walked the earth.  His bones are found in vast masses, all\r\ncrammed together in huge graves.  They are not in caves, but in the\r\nground.  Nobody knows how they happened to get concentrated there.  Mind,\r\nthey are bones, not fossils.  This means that the moa has not been\r\nextinct very long.  Still, this is the only New Zealand creature which\r\nhas no mention in that otherwise comprehensive literature, the native\r\nlegends.  This is a significant detail, and is good circumstantial\r\nevidence that the moa has been extinct 500 years, since the Maori has\r\nhimself--by tradition--been in New Zealand since the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.  He came from an unknown land--the first Maori did--then sailed\r\nback in his canoe and brought his tribe, and they removed the aboriginal\r\npeoples into the sea and into the ground and took the land.  That is the\r\ntradition.  That that first Maori could come, is understandable, for\r\nanybody can come to a place when he isn't trying to; but how that\r\ndiscoverer found his way back home again without a compass is his secret,\r\nand he died with it in him.  His language indicates that he came from\r\nPolynesia.  He told where he came from, but he couldn't spell well, so\r\none can't find the place on the map, because people who could spell\r\nbetter than he could, spelt the resemblance all out of it when they made\r\nthe map.  However, it is better to have a map that is spelt right than\r\none that has information in it.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand women have the right to vote for members of the\r\nlegislature, but they cannot be members themselves.  The law extending\r\nthe suffrage to them went into effect in 1893.  The population of\r\nChristchurch (census of 1891) was 31,454.  The first election under the\r\nlaw was held in November of that year.  Number of men who voted, 6,313;\r\nnumber of women who voted, 5,989.  These figures ought to convince us\r\nthat women are not as indifferent about politics as some people would\r\nhave us believe.  In New Zealand as a whole, the estimated adult female\r\npopulation was 139,915; of these 109,461 qualified and registered their\r\nnames on the rolls 78.23 per cent. of the whole.  Of these, 90,290 went\r\nto the polls and voted--85.18 per cent.  Do men ever turn out better than\r\nthat--in America or elsewhere?  Here is a remark to the other sex's\r\ncredit, too--I take it from the official report:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA feature of the election was the orderliness and sobriety of the\r\npeople.  Women were in no way molested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt home, a standing argument against woman suffrage has always been that\r\nwomen could not go to the polls without being insulted.  The arguments\r\nagainst woman suffrage have always taken the easy form of prophecy.  The\r\nprophets have been prophesying ever since the woman's rights movement\r\nbegan in 1848--and in forty-seven years they have never scored a hit.\r\n\r\nMen ought to begin to feel a sort of respect for their mothers and wives\r\nand sisters by this time.  The women deserve a change of attitude like\r\nthat, for they have wrought well.  In forty-seven years they have swept\r\nan imposingly large number of unfair laws from the statute books of\r\nAmerica.  In that brief time these serfs have set themselves free--\r\nessentially.  Men could not have done so much for themselves in that time\r\nwithout bloodshed--at least they never have; and that is argument that\r\nthey didn't know how.  The women have accomplished a peaceful revolution,\r\nand a very beneficent one; and yet that has not convinced the average man\r\nthat they are intelligent, and have courage and energy and perseverance\r\nand fortitude.  It takes much to convince the average man of anything;\r\nand perhaps nothing can ever make him realize that he is the average\r\nwoman's inferior--yet in several important details the evidence seems to\r\nshow that that is what he is.  Man has ruled the human race from the\r\nbeginning--but he should remember that up to the middle of the present\r\ncentury it was a dull world, and ignorant and stupid; but it is not such\r\na dull world now, and is growing less and less dull all the time.  This\r\nis woman's opportunity--she has had none before.  I wonder where man will\r\nbe in another forty-seven years?\r\n\r\nIn the New Zealand law occurs this: \xe2\x80\x9cThe word person wherever it occurs\r\nthroughout the Act includes woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is promotion, you see.  By that enlargement of the word, the matron\r\nwith the garnered wisdom and experience of fifty years becomes at one\r\njump the political equal of her callow kid of twenty-one.  The white\r\npopulation of the colony is 626,000, the Maori population is 42,000.  The\r\nwhites elect seventy members of the House of Representatives, the Maoris\r\nfour.  The Maori women vote for their four members.\r\n\r\nNovember 16.   After four pleasant days in Christchurch, we are to leave\r\nat midnight to-night.  Mr. Kinsey gave me an ornithorhynchus, and I am\r\ntaming it.\r\n\r\nSunday, 17th.  Sailed last night in the Flora, from Lyttelton.\r\n\r\nSo we did.  I remember it yet.  The people who sailed in the Flora that\r\nnight may forget some other things if they live a good while, but they\r\nwill not live long enough to forget that.  The Flora is about the\r\nequivalent of a cattle-scow; but when the Union Company find it\r\ninconvenient to keep a contract and lucrative to break it, they smuggle\r\nher into passenger service, and \xe2\x80\x9ckeep the change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey give no notice of their projected depredation; you innocently buy\r\ntickets for the advertised passenger boat, and when you get down to\r\nLyttelton at midnight, you find that they have substituted the scow.\r\nThey have plenty of good boats, but no competition--and that is the\r\ntrouble.  It is too late now to make other arrangements if you have\r\nengagements ahead.\r\n\r\nIt is a powerful company, it has a monopoly, and everybody is afraid of\r\nit--including the government's representative, who stands at the end of\r\nthe stage-plank to tally the passengers and see that no boat receives a\r\ngreater number than the law allows her to carry.  This conveniently-blind\r\nrepresentative saw the scow receive a number which was far in excess of\r\nits privilege, and winked a politic wink and said nothing.  The\r\npassengers bore with meekness the cheat which had been put upon them, and\r\nmade no complaint.\r\n\r\nIt was like being at home in America, where abused passengers act in just\r\nthe same way.  A few days before, the Union Company had discharged a\r\ncaptain for getting a boat into danger, and had advertised this act as\r\nevidence of its vigilance in looking after the safety of the passengers\r\n--for thugging a captain costs the company nothing, but when opportunity\r\noffered to send this dangerously overcrowded tub to sea and save a little\r\ntrouble and a tidy penny by it, it forgot to worry about the passenger's\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe first officer told me that the Flora was privileged to carry 125\r\npassengers.  She must have had all of 200 on board.  All the cabins were\r\nfull, all the cattle-stalls in the main stable were full, the spaces at\r\nthe heads of companionways were full, every inch of floor and table in\r\nthe swill-room was packed with sleeping men and remained so until the\r\nplace was required for breakfast, all the chairs and benches on the\r\nhurricane deck were occupied, and still there were people who had to walk\r\nabout all night!\r\n\r\nIf the Flora had gone down that night, half of the people on board would\r\nhave been wholly without means of escape.\r\n\r\nThe owners of that boat were not technically guilty of conspiracy to\r\ncommit murder, but they were morally guilty of it.\r\n\r\nI had a cattle-stall in the main stable--a cavern fitted up with a long\r\ndouble file of two-storied bunks, the files separated by a calico\r\npartition--twenty men and boys on one side of it, twenty women and girls\r\non the other.  The place was as dark as the soul of the Union Company,\r\nand smelt like a kennel.  When the vessel got out into the heavy seas and\r\nbegan to pitch and wallow, the cavern prisoners became immediately\r\nseasick, and then the peculiar results that ensued laid all my previous\r\nexperiences of the kind well away in the shade.  And the wails, the\r\ngroans, the cries, the shrieks, the strange ejaculations--it was\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\nThe women and children and some of the men and boys spent the night in\r\nthat place, for they were too ill to leave it; but the rest of us got up,\r\nby and by, and finished the night on the hurricane-deck.\r\n\r\nThat boat was the foulest I was ever in; and the smell of the breakfast\r\nsaloon when we threaded our way among the layers of steaming passengers\r\nstretched upon its floor and its tables was incomparable for efficiency.\r\n\r\nA good many of us got ashore at the first way-port to seek another ship.\r\nAfter a wait of three hours we got good rooms in the Mahinapua, a wee\r\nlittle bridal-parlor of a boat--only 205 tons burthen; clean and\r\ncomfortable; good service; good beds; good table, and no crowding.  The\r\nseas danced her about like a duck, but she was safe and capable.\r\n\r\nNext morning early she went through the French Pass--a narrow gateway of\r\nrock, between bold headlands--so narrow, in fact, that it seemed no wider\r\nthan a street.  The current tore through there like a mill-race, and the\r\nboat darted through like a telegram.  The passage was made in half a\r\nminute; then we were in a wide place where noble vast eddies swept\r\ngrandly round and round in shoal water, and I wondered what they would do\r\nwith the little boat.  They did as they pleased with her.  They picked\r\nher up and flung her around like nothing and landed her gently on the\r\nsolid, smooth bottom of sand--so gently, indeed, that we barely felt her\r\ntouch it, barely felt her quiver when she came to a standstill.  The\r\nwater was as clear as glass, the sand on the bottom was vividly distinct,\r\nand the fishes seemed to be swimming about in nothing.  Fishing lines\r\nwere brought out, but before we could bait the hooks the boat was off and\r\naway again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nLet us be grateful to Adam our benefactor.  He cut us out of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cblessing of idleness,\xe2\x80\x9d and won for us the \xe2\x80\x9ccurse of labor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                   --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWe soon reached the town of Nelson, and spent the most of the day there,\r\nvisiting acquaintances and driving with them about the garden--the whole\r\nregion is a garden, excepting the scene of the \xe2\x80\x9cMaungatapu Murders,\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nthirty years ago.  That is a wild place--wild and lonely; an ideal place\r\nfor a murder.  It is at the base of a vast, rugged, densely timbered\r\nmountain.  In the deep twilight of that forest solitude four desperate\r\nrascals--Burgess, Sullivan, Levy, and Kelley--ambushed themselves beside\r\nthe mountain-trail to murder and rob four travelers--Kempthorne, Mathieu,\r\nDudley, and De Pontius, the latter a New Yorker. A harmless old laboring\r\nman came wandering along, and as his presence was an embarrassment, they\r\nchoked him, hid him, and then resumed their watch for the four.  They had\r\nto wait a while, but eventually everything turned out as they desired.\r\n\r\nThat dark episode is the one large event in the history of Nelson.  The\r\nfame of it traveled far.  Burgess made a confession.  It is a remarkable\r\npaper.  For brevity, succinctness, and concentration, it is perhaps\r\nwithout its peer in the literature of murder.  There are no waste words\r\nin it; there is no obtrusion of matter not pertinent to the occasion, nor\r\nany departure from the dispassionate tone proper to a formal business\r\nstatement--for that is what it is: a business statement of a murder, by\r\nthe chief engineer of it, or superintendent, or foreman, or whatever one\r\nmay prefer to call him.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWe were getting impatient, when we saw four men and a pack-horse\r\n     coming.  I left my cover and had a look at the men, for Levy had\r\n     told me that Mathieu was a small man and wore a large beard, and\r\n     that it was a chestnut horse.  I said, 'Here they come.'  They were\r\n     then a good distance away; I took the caps off my gun, and put fresh\r\n     ones on.  I said, 'You keep where you are, I'll put them up, and you\r\n     give me your gun while you tie them.'  It was arranged as I have\r\n     described.  The men came; they arrived within about fifteen yards\r\n     when I stepped up and said, 'Stand! bail up!'  That means all of\r\n     them to get together.  I made them fall back on the upper side of\r\n     the road with their faces up the range, and Sullivan brought me his\r\n     gun, and then tied their hands behind them.  The horse was very\r\n     quiet all the time, he did not move.  When they were all tied,\r\n     Sullivan took the horse up the hill, and put him in the bush; he cut\r\n     the rope and let the swags--[A \xe2\x80\x9cswag\xe2\x80\x9d is a kit, a pack, small\r\n     baggage.]--fall on the ground, and then came to me.  We then marched\r\n     the men down the incline to the creek; the water at this time barely\r\n     running.  Up this creek we took the men; we went, I daresay, five or\r\n     six hundred yards up it, which took us nearly half-an-hour to\r\n     accomplish.  Then we turned to the right up the range; we went, I\r\n     daresay, one hundred and fifty yards from the creek, and there we\r\n     sat down with the men.  I said to Sullivan, 'Put down your gun and\r\n     search these men,' which he did.  I asked them their several names;\r\n     they told me.  I asked them if they were expected at Nelson.  They\r\n     said, 'No.'  If such their lives would have been spared.  In money\r\n     we took L60 odd.  I said, 'Is this all you have?  You had better\r\n     tell me.' Sullivan said, 'Here is a bag of gold.' I said, 'What's on\r\n     that pack-horse?  Is there any gold?' when Kempthorne said, 'Yes,\r\n     my gold is in the portmanteau, and I trust you will not take it\r\n     all.' 'Well,' I said, 'we must take you away one at a time, because\r\n     the range is steep just here, and then we will let you go.' They\r\n     said, 'All right,' most cheerfully.  We tied their feet, and took\r\n     Dudley with us; we went about sixty yards with him.  This was\r\n     through a scrub.  It was arranged the night previously that it would\r\n     be best to choke them, in case the report of the arms might be heard\r\n     from the road, and if they were missed they never would be found.\r\n     So we tied a handkerchief over his eyes, when Sullivan took the sash\r\n     off his waist, put it round his neck, and so strangled him.\r\n     Sullivan, after I had killed the old laboring man, found fault with\r\n     the way he was choked.  He said, 'The next we do I'll show you my\r\n     way.'  I said, 'I have never done such a thing before.  I have shot\r\n     a man, but never choked one.'  We returned to the others, when\r\n     Kempthorne said, 'What noise was that?'  I said it was caused by\r\n     breaking through the scrub.  This was taking too much time, so it\r\n     was agreed to shoot them.  With that I said, 'We'll take you no\r\n     further, but separate you, and then loose one of you, and he can\r\n     relieve the others.'  So with that, Sullivan took De Pontius to the\r\n     left of where Kempthorne was sitting.  I took Mathieu to the right.\r\n     I tied a strap round his legs, and shot him with a revolver.  He\r\n     yelled, I ran from him with my gun in my hand, I sighted Kempthorne,\r\n     who had risen to his feet.  I presented the gun, and shot him behind\r\n     the right ear; his life's blood welled from him, and he died\r\n     instantaneously.  Sullivan had shot De Pontius in the meantime,\r\n     and then came to me.  I said, 'Look to Mathieu,' indicating the spot\r\n     where he lay.  He shortly returned and said, 'I had to \xe2\x80\x9cchiv\xe2\x80\x9d that\r\n     fellow, he was not dead,' a cant word, meaning that he had to stab\r\n     him.  Returning to the road we passed where De Pontius lay and was\r\n     dead.  Sullivan said, 'This is the digger, the others were all\r\n     storekeepers; this is the digger, let's cover him up, for should the\r\n     others be found, they'll think he done it and sloped,' meaning he\r\n     had gone.  So with that we threw all the stones on him, and then\r\n     left him.  This bloody work took nearly an hour and a half from the\r\n     time we stopped the men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnyone who reads that confession will think that the man who wrote it was\r\ndestitute of emotions, destitute of feeling.  That is partly true.  As\r\nregarded others he was plainly without feeling--utterly cold and\r\npitiless; but as regarded himself the case was different.  While he cared\r\nnothing for the future of the murdered men, he cared a great deal for his\r\nown.  It makes one's flesh creep to read the introduction to his\r\nconfession.  The judge on the bench characterized it as \xe2\x80\x9cscandalously\r\nblasphemous,\xe2\x80\x9d and it certainly reads so, but Burgess meant no blasphemy.\r\nHe was merely a brute, and whatever he said or wrote was sure to expose\r\nthe fact.  His redemption was a very real thing to him, and he was as\r\njubilantly happy on the gallows as ever was Christian martyr at the\r\nstake.  We dwellers in this world are strangely made, and mysteriously\r\ncircumstanced.  We have to suppose that the murdered men are lost, and\r\nthat Burgess is saved; but we cannot suppress our natural regrets.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWritten in my dungeon drear this 7th of August, in the year of\r\n     Grace, 1866.  To God be ascribed all power and glory in subduing the\r\n     rebellious spirit of a most guilty wretch, who has been brought,\r\n     through the instrumentality of a faithful follower of Christ, to see\r\n     his wretched and guilty state, inasmuch as hitherto he has led an\r\n     awful and wretched life, and through the assurance of this faithful\r\n     soldier of Christ, he has been led and also believes that Christ\r\n     will yet receive and cleanse him from all his deep-dyed and bloody\r\n     sins.  I lie under the imputation which says, 'Come now and let us\r\n     reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet,\r\n     they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson,\r\n     they shall be as wool.' On this promise I rely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe sailed in the afternoon late, spent a few hours at New Plymouth, then\r\nsailed again and reached Auckland the next day, November 20th, and\r\nremained in that fine city several days.  Its situation is commanding,\r\nand the sea-view is superb.  There are charming drives all about, and by\r\ncourtesy of friends we had opportunity to enjoy them.  From the grassy\r\ncrater-summit of Mount Eden one's eye ranges over a grand sweep and\r\nvariety of scenery--forests clothed in luxuriant foliage, rolling green\r\nfields, conflagrations of flowers, receding and dimming stretches of\r\ngreen plain, broken by lofty and symmetrical old craters--then the blue\r\nbays twinkling and sparkling away into the dreamy distances where the\r\nmountains loom spiritual in their veils of haze.\r\n\r\nIt is from Auckland that one goes to Rotorua, the region of the renowned\r\nhot lakes and geysers--one of the chief wonders of New Zealand; but I was\r\nnot well enough to make the trip.  The government has a sanitorium there,\r\nand everything is comfortable for the tourist and the invalid.  The\r\ngovernment's official physician is almost over-cautious in his estimates\r\nof the efficacy of the baths, when he is talking about rheumatism, gout,\r\nparalysis, and such things; but when he is talking about the\r\neffectiveness of the waters in eradicating the whisky-habit, he seems to\r\nhave no reserves.  The baths will cure the drinking-habit no matter how\r\nchronic it is--and cure it so effectually that even the desire to drink\r\nintoxicants will come no more.  There should be a rush from Europe and\r\nAmerica to that place; and when the victims of alcoholism find out what\r\nthey can get by going there, the rush will begin.\r\n\r\nThe Thermal-springs District of New Zealand comprises an area of upwards\r\nof 600,000 acres, or close on 1,000 square miles.  Rotorua is the\r\nfavorite place.  It is the center of a rich field of lake and mountain\r\nscenery; from Rotorua as a base the pleasure-seeker makes excursions.\r\nThe crowd of sick people is great, and growing.  Rotorua is the Carlsbad\r\nof Australasia.\r\n\r\nIt is from Auckland that the Kauri gum is shipped.  For a long time now\r\nabout 8,000 tons of it have been brought into the town per year.  It is\r\nworth about $300 per ton, unassorted; assorted, the finest grades are\r\nworth about $1,000.  It goes to America, chiefly.  It is in lumps, and is\r\nhard and smooth, and looks like amber--the light-colored like new amber,\r\nand the dark brown like rich old amber.  And it has the pleasant feel of\r\namber, too.  Some of the light-colored samples were a tolerably fair\r\ncounterfeit of uncut South African diamonds, they were so perfectly\r\nsmooth and polished and transparent.  It is manufactured into varnish; a\r\nvarnish which answers for copal varnish and is cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe gum is dug up out of the ground; it has been there for ages.  It is\r\nthe sap of the Kauri tree.  Dr. Campbell of Auckland told me he sent a\r\ncargo of it to England fifty years ago, but nothing came of the venture.\r\nNobody knew what to do with it; so it was sold at L5 a ton, to light\r\nfires with.\r\n\r\nNovember 26--3 P.M., sailed.  Vast and beautiful harbor.  Land all about\r\nfor hours.  Tangariwa, the mountain that \xe2\x80\x9chas the same shape from every\r\npoint of view.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is the common belief in Auckland.  And so it has\r\n--from every point of view except thirteen.  Perfect summer weather.\r\nLarge\r\nschool of whales in the distance.  Nothing could be daintier than the\r\npuffs of vapor they spout up, when seen against the pink glory of the\r\nsinking sun, or against the dark mass of an island reposing in the deep\r\nblue shadow of a storm cloud .  .  .  .  Great Barrier rock standing up\r\nout of the sea away to the left.  Sometime ago a ship hit it full speed\r\nin a fog--20 miles out of her course--140 lives lost; the captain\r\ncommitted suicide without waiting a moment.  He knew that, whether he was\r\nto blame or not, the company owning the vessel would discharge him and\r\nmake a devotion--to--passengers' safety advertisement out of it, and his\r\nchance to make a livelihood would be permanently gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nLet us not be too particular.  It is better to have old second-hand\r\ndiamonds than none at all.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nNovember 27.   To-day we reached Gisborne, and anchored in a big bay;\r\nthere was a heavy sea on, so we remained on board.\r\n\r\nWe were a mile from shore; a little steam-tug put out from the land; she\r\nwas an object of thrilling interest; she would climb to the summit of a\r\nbillow, reel drunkenly there a moment, dim and gray in the driving storm\r\nof spindrift, then make a plunge like a diver and remain out of sight\r\nuntil one had given her up, then up she would dart again, on a steep\r\nslant toward the sky, shedding Niagaras of water from her forecastle--and\r\nthis she kept up, all the way out to us.  She brought twenty-five\r\npassengers in her stomach--men and women--mainly a traveling dramatic\r\ncompany.  In sight on deck were the crew, in sou'westers, yellow\r\nwaterproof canvas suits, and boots to the thigh.  The deck was never\r\nquiet for a moment, and seldom nearer level than a ladder, and noble were\r\nthe seas which leapt aboard and went flooding aft.  We rove a long line\r\nto the yard-arm, hung a most primitive basketchair to it and swung it out\r\ninto the spacious air of heaven, and there it swayed, pendulum-fashion,\r\nwaiting for its chance--then down it shot, skillfully aimed, and was\r\ngrabbed by the two men on the forecastle.  A young fellow belonging to\r\nour crew was in the chair, to be a protection to the lady-comers.  At\r\nonce a couple of ladies appeared from below, took seats in his lap, we\r\nhoisted them into the sky, waited a moment till the roll of the ship\r\nbrought them in overhead, then we lowered suddenly away, and seized the\r\nchair as it struck the deck.  We took the twenty-five aboard, and\r\ndelivered twenty-five into the tug--among them several aged ladies, and\r\none blind one--and all without accident.  It was a fine piece of work.\r\n\r\nOurs is a nice ship, roomy, comfortable, well-ordered, and satisfactory.\r\nNow and then we step on a rat in a hotel, but we have had no rats on\r\nshipboard lately; unless, perhaps in the Flora; we had more serious\r\nthings to think of there, and did not notice.  I have noticed that it is\r\nonly in ships and hotels which still employ the odious Chinese gong, that\r\nyou find rats.  The reason would seem to be, that as a rat cannot tell\r\nthe time of day by a clock, he won't stay where he cannot find out when\r\ndinner is ready.\r\n\r\nNovember 29.  The doctor tells me of several old drunkards, one\r\nspiritless loafer, and several far-gone moral wrecks who have been\r\nreclaimed by the Salvation Army and have remained staunch people and hard\r\nworkers these two years.  Wherever one goes, these testimonials to the\r\nArmy's efficiency are forthcoming .  .  .  .  This morning we had one of\r\nthose whizzing green Ballarat flies in the room, with his stunning\r\nbuzz-saw noise--the swiftest creature in the world except the\r\nlightning-flash. It is a stupendous force that is stored up in that\r\nlittle body. If we had it in a ship in the same proportion, we could spin\r\nfrom Liverpool to New York in the space of an hour--the time it takes to\r\neat luncheon.  The New Zealand express train is called the Ballarat Fly\r\n.  .  .  .  Bad teeth in the colonies.  A citizen told me they don't have\r\nteeth filled, but pull them out and put in false ones, and that now and\r\nthen one sees a young lady with a full set.  She is fortunate.  I wish I\r\nhad been born with false teeth and a false liver and false carbuncles.\r\nI should get along better.\r\n\r\nDecember 2.  Monday.  Left Napier in the Ballarat Fly the one that goes\r\ntwice a week.  From Napier to Hastings, twelve miles; time, fifty-five\r\nminutes--not so far short of thirteen miles an hour .  .  .  .  A perfect\r\nsummer day; cool breeze, brilliant sky, rich vegetation.  Two or three\r\ntimes during the afternoon we saw wonderfully dense and beautiful\r\nforests, tumultuously piled skyward on the broken highlands--not the\r\ncustomary roof-like slant of a hillside, where the trees are all the same\r\nheight.  The noblest of these trees were of the Kauri breed, we were told\r\n--the timber that is now furnishing the wood-paving for Europe, and is\r\nthe\r\nbest of all wood for that purpose.  Sometimes these towering upheavals of\r\nforestry were festooned and garlanded with vine-cables, and sometimes the\r\nmasses of undergrowth were cocooned in another sort of vine of a delicate\r\ncobwebby texture--they call it the \xe2\x80\x9csupplejack,\xe2\x80\x9d I think.  Tree ferns\r\neverywhere--a stem fifteen feet high, with a graceful chalice of\r\nfern-fronds sprouting from its top--a lovely forest ornament.  And there\r\nwas a ten-foot reed with a flowing suit of what looked like yellow hair\r\nhanging from its upper end.  I do not know its name, but if there is such\r\na thing as a scalp-plant, this is it.  A romantic gorge, with a brook\r\nflowing in its bottom, approaching Palmerston North.\r\n\r\nWaitukurau.   Twenty minutes for luncheon.  With me sat my wife and\r\ndaughter, and my manager, Mr. Carlyle Smythe.  I sat at the head of the\r\ntable, and could see the right-hand wall; the others had their backs to\r\nit.  On that wall, at a good distance away, were a couple of framed\r\npictures.  I could not see them clearly, but from the groupings of the\r\nfigures I fancied that they represented the killing of Napoleon III's son\r\nby the Zulus in South Africa.  I broke into the conversation, which was\r\nabout poetry and cabbage and art, and said to my wife--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember when the news came to Paris----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf the killing of the Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(Those were the very words I had in my mind.) \xe2\x80\x9cYes, but what Prince?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNapoleon.  Lulu.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat made you think of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no collusion.  She had not seen the pictures, and they had not\r\nbeen mentioned.  She ought to have thought of some recent news that came\r\nto Paris, for we were but seven months from there and had been living\r\nthere a couple of years when we started on this trip; but instead of that\r\nshe thought of an incident of our brief sojourn in Paris of sixteen years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHere was a clear case of mental telegraphy; of mind-transference; of my\r\nmind telegraphing a thought into hers.  How do I know?  Because I\r\ntelegraphed an error.  For it turned out that the pictures did not\r\nrepresent the killing of Lulu at all, nor anything connected with Lulu.\r\nShe had to get the error from my head--it existed nowhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nThe Autocrat of Russia possesses more power than any other man in the\r\nearth; but he cannot stop a sneeze.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWAUGANUI, December 3.  A pleasant trip, yesterday, per Ballarat Fly.\r\nFour hours.  I do not know the distance, but it must have been well along\r\ntoward fifty miles.  The Fly could have spun it out to eight hours and\r\nnot discommoded me; for where there is comfort, and no need for hurry,\r\nspeed is of no value--at least to me; and nothing that goes on wheels can\r\nbe more comfortable, more satisfactory, than the New Zealand trains.\r\nOutside of America there are no cars that are so rationally devised.\r\nWhen you add the constant presence of charming scenery and the nearly\r\nconstant absence of dust--well, if one is not content then, he ought to\r\nget out and walk.  That would change his spirit, perhaps?  I think so.\r\nAt the end of an hour you would find him waiting humbly beside the track,\r\nand glad to be taken aboard again.\r\n\r\nMuch horseback riding, in and around this town; many comely girls in cool\r\nand pretty summer gowns; much Salvation Army; lots of Maoris; the faces\r\nand bodies of some of the old ones very tastefully frescoed.  Maori\r\nCouncil House over the river--large, strong, carpeted from end to end\r\nwith\r\nmatting, and decorated with elaborate wood carvings, artistically\r\nexecuted.  The Maoris were very polite.\r\n\r\nI was assured by a member of the House of Representatives that the native\r\nrace is not decreasing, but actually increasing slightly.  It is another\r\nevidence that they are a superior breed of savages.  I do not call to\r\nmind any savage race that built such good houses, or such strong and\r\ningenious and scientific fortresses, or gave so much attention to\r\nagriculture, or had military arts and devices which so nearly approached\r\nthe white man's.  These, taken together with their high abilities in\r\nboat-building, and their tastes and capacities in the ornamental arts\r\nmodify their savagery to a semi-civilization--or at least to,\r\na quarter-civilization.\r\n\r\nIt is a compliment to them that the British did not exterminate them, as\r\nthey did the Australians and the Tasmanians, but were content with\r\nsubduing them, and showed no desire to go further.  And it is another\r\ncompliment to them that the British did not take the whole of their\r\nchoicest lands, but left them a considerable part, and then went further\r\nand protected them from the rapacities of landsharks--a protection which\r\nthe New Zealand Government still extends to them.  And it is still\r\nanother compliment to the Maoris that the Government allows native\r\nrepresentation--in both the legislature and the cabinet, and gives both\r\nsexes the vote.  And in doing these things the Government also\r\ncompliments itself; it has not been the custom of the world for\r\nconquerors to act in this large spirit toward the conquered.\r\n\r\nThe highest class white men who lived among the Maoris in the earliest\r\ntime had a high opinion of them and a strong affection for them.  Among\r\nthe whites of this sort was the author of \xe2\x80\x9cOld New Zealand;\xe2\x80\x9d and Dr.\r\nCampbell of Auckland was another.  Dr. Campbell was a close friend of\r\nseveral chiefs, and has many pleasant things to say of their fidelity,\r\ntheir magnanimity, and their generosity.  Also of their quaint notions\r\nabout the white man's queer civilization, and their equally quaint\r\ncomments upon it.  One of them thought the missionary had got everything\r\nwrong end first and upside down.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he wants us to stop worshiping\r\nand supplicating the evil gods, and go to worshiping and supplicating the\r\nGood One!  There is no sense in that. A good god is not going to do us\r\nany harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Maoris had the tabu; and had it on a Polynesian scale of\r\ncomprehensiveness and elaboration.  Some of its features could have been\r\nimportations from India and Judea.  Neither the Maori nor the Hindoo of\r\ncommon degree could cook by a fire that a person of higher caste had\r\nused, nor could the high Maori or high Hindoo employ fire that had served\r\na man of low grade; if a low-grade Maori or Hindoo drank from a vessel\r\nbelonging to a high-grade man, the vessel was defiled, and had to be\r\ndestroyed.  There were other resemblances between Maori tabu and Hindoo\r\ncaste-custom.\r\n\r\nYesterday a lunatic burst into my quarters and warned me that the Jesuits\r\nwere going to \xe2\x80\x9ccook\xe2\x80\x9d (poison) me in my food, or kill me on the stage at\r\nnight.  He said a mysterious sign was visible upon my posters and meant\r\nmy death.  He said he saved Rev. Mr. Haweis's life by warning him that\r\nthere were three men on his platform who would kill him if he took his\r\neyes off them for a moment during his lecture.  The same men were in my\r\naudience last night, but they saw that he was there.  \xe2\x80\x9cWill they be there\r\nagain to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d  He hesitated; then said no, he thought they would\r\nrather take a rest and chance the poison.  This lunatic has no delicacy.\r\nBut he was not uninteresting.  He told me a lot of things.  He said he\r\nhad \xe2\x80\x9csaved so many lecturers in twenty years, that they put him in the\r\nasylum.\xe2\x80\x9d  I think he has less refinement than any lunatic I have met.\r\n\r\nDecember 8.  A couple of curious war-monuments here at Wanganui.  One is\r\nin honor of white men \xe2\x80\x9cwho fell in defence of law and order against\r\nfanaticism and barbarism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fanaticism.  We Americans are English in\r\nblood, English in speech, English in religion, English in the essentials\r\nof our governmental system, English in the essentials of our\r\ncivilization; and so, let us hope, for the honor of the blend, for the\r\nhonor of the blood, for the honor of the race, that that word got there\r\nthrough lack of heedfulness, and will not be suffered to remain.  If you\r\ncarve it at Thermopylae, or where Winkelried died, or upon Bunker Hill\r\nmonument, and read it again \xe2\x80\x9cwho fell in defence of law and order against\r\nfanaticism\xe2\x80\x9d you will perceive what the word means, and how mischosen it\r\nis.  Patriotism is Patriotism.  Calling it Fanaticism cannot degrade it;\r\nnothing can degrade it.  Even though it be a political mistake, and a\r\nthousand times a political mistake, that does not affect it; it is\r\nhonorabl--always honorable, always noble--and privileged to hold its head\r\nup and look the nations in the face.  It is right to praise these brave\r\nwhite men who fell in the Maori war--they deserve it; but the presence of\r\nthat word detracts from the dignity of their cause and their deeds, and\r\nmakes them appear to have spilt their blood in a conflict with ignoble\r\nmen, men not worthy of that costly sacrifice.  But the men were worthy.\r\nIt was no shame to fight them.  They fought for their homes, they fought\r\nfor their country; they bravely fought and bravely fell; and it would\r\ntake nothing from the honor of the brave Englishmen who lie under the\r\nmonument, but add to it, to say that they died in defense of English laws\r\nand English homes against men worthy of the sacrifice--the Maori\r\npatriots.\r\n\r\nThe other monument cannot be rectified.  Except with dynamite.  It is a\r\nmistake all through, and a strangely thoughtless one.  It is a monument\r\nerected by white men to Maoris who fell fighting with the whites and\r\nagainst their own people, in the Maori war.  \xe2\x80\x9cSacred to the memory of the\r\nbrave men who fell on the 14th of May, 1864,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.  On one side are the\r\nnames of about twenty Maoris.  It is not a fancy of mine; the monument\r\nexists.  I saw it.  It is an object-lesson to the rising generation.  It\r\ninvites to treachery, disloyalty, unpatriotism.  Its lesson, in frank\r\nterms is, \xe2\x80\x9cDesert your flag, slay your people, burn their homes, shame\r\nyour nationality--we honor such.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDecember 9.  Wellington.  Ten hours from Wanganui by the Fly.\r\nDecember 12.  It is a fine city and nobly situated.  A busy place, and\r\nfull of life and movement.  Have spent the three days partly in walking\r\nabout, partly in enjoying social privileges, and largely in idling around\r\nthe magnificent garden at Hutt, a little distance away, around the shore.\r\nI suppose we shall not see such another one soon.\r\n\r\nWe are packing to-night for the return-voyage to Australia.  Our stay in\r\nNew Zealand has been too brief; still, we are not unthankful for the\r\nglimpse which we have had of it.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy Maoris made the settlement of the country by the whites rather\r\ndifficult.  Not at first--but later.  At first they welcomed the whites,\r\nand were eager to trade with them--particularly for muskets; for their\r\npastime was internecine war, and they greatly preferred the white man's\r\nweapons to their own.  War was their pastime--I use the word advisedly.\r\nThey often met and slaughtered each other just for a lark, and when there\r\nwas no quarrel.  The author of \xe2\x80\x9cOld New Zealand\xe2\x80\x9d mentions a case where a\r\nvictorious army could have followed up its advantage and exterminated the\r\nopposing army, but declined to do it; explaining naively that \xe2\x80\x9cif we did\r\nthat, there couldn't be any more fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d  In another battle one army\r\nsent word that it was out of ammunition, and would be obliged to stop\r\nunless the opposing army would send some.  It was sent, and the fight\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nIn the early days things went well enough.  The natives sold land without\r\nclearly understanding the terms of exchange, and the whites bought it\r\nwithout being much disturbed about the native's confusion of mind.  But\r\nby and by the Maori began to comprehend that he was being wronged; then\r\nthere was trouble, for he was not the man to swallow a wrong and go aside\r\nand cry about it.  He had the Tasmanian's spirit and endurance, and a\r\nnotable share of military science besides; and so he rose against the\r\noppressor, did this gallant \xe2\x80\x9cfanatic,\xe2\x80\x9d and started a war that was not\r\nbrought to a definite end until more than a generation had sped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nThere are several good protections against temptations, but the surest is\r\ncowardice.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nNames are not always what they seem.  The common Welsh name Bzjxxllwep is\r\npronounced Jackson.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nFriday, December 13.   Sailed, at 3 p.m., in the 'Mararoa'.  Summer seas\r\nand a good ship--life has nothing better.\r\n\r\nMonday.  Three days of paradise.  Warm and sunny and smooth; the sea a\r\nluminous Mediterranean blue .  .  .  .  One lolls in a long chair all day\r\nunder deck-awnings, and reads and smokes, in measureless content.  One\r\ndoes not read prose at such a time, but poetry.  I have been reading the\r\npoems of Mrs. Julia A. Moore, again, and I find in them the same grace\r\nand melody that attracted me when they were first published, twenty years\r\nago, and have held me in happy bonds ever since.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sentimental Song Book\xe2\x80\x9d has long been out of print, and has been\r\nforgotten by the world in general, but not by me.  I carry it with me\r\nalways--it and Goldsmith's deathless story.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it has the same deep charm for me that the Vicar of Wakefield\r\nhas, and I find in it the same subtle touch--the touch that makes an\r\nintentionally humorous episode pathetic and an intentionally pathetic one\r\nfunny.  In her time Mrs. Moore was called \xe2\x80\x9cthe Sweet Singer of Michigan,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and was best known by that name.  I have read her book through twice\r\ntoday, with the purpose of determining which of her pieces has most\r\nmerit, and I am persuaded that for wide grasp and sustained power,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam Upson\xe2\x80\x9d may claim first place:\r\n\r\nWILLIAM UPSON.\r\n\r\nAir--\xe2\x80\x9cThe Major's Only Son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Come all good people far and near,\r\nOh, come and see what you can hear,\r\nIt's of a young man true and brave,\r\nThat is now sleeping in his grave.\r\n\r\nNow, William Upson was his name\r\nIf it's not that, it's all the same\r\nHe did enlist in a cruel strife,\r\nAnd it caused him to lose his life.\r\n\r\nHe was Perry Upson's eldest son,\r\nHis father loved his noble son,\r\nThis son was nineteen years of age\r\nWhen first in the rebellion he engaged.\r\n\r\nHis father said that he might go,\r\nBut his dear mother she said no,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! stay at home, dear Billy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said,\r\nBut she could not turn his head.\r\n\r\nHe went to Nashville, in Tennessee,\r\nThere his kind friends he could not see;\r\nHe died among strangers, so far away,\r\nThey did not know where his body lay.\r\n\r\nHe was taken sick and lived four weeks,\r\nAnd Oh! how his parents weep,\r\nBut now they must in sorrow mourn,\r\nFor Billy has gone to his heavenly home.\r\n\r\nOh! if his mother could have seen her son,\r\nFor she loved him, her darling son;\r\nIf she could heard his dying prayer,\r\nIt would ease her heart till she met him there.\r\n\r\nHow it would relieve his mother's heart\r\nTo see her son from this world depart,\r\nAnd hear his noble words of love,\r\nAs he left this world for that above.\r\n\r\nNow it will relieve his mother's heart,\r\nFor her son is laid in our graveyard;\r\nFor now she knows that his grave is near,\r\nShe will not shed so many tears.\r\n\r\nAlthough she knows not that it was her son,\r\nFor his coffin could not be opened\r\nIt might be someone in his place,\r\nFor she could not see his noble face.\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember, 17.  Reached Sydney.\r\n\r\nDecember, 19.  In the train.  Fellow of 30 with four valises; a slim\r\ncreature, with teeth which made his mouth look like a neglected\r\nchurchyard.  He had solidified hair--solidified with pomatum; it was all\r\none shell.  He smoked the most extraordinary cigarettes--made of some\r\nkind of manure, apparently.  These and his hair made him smell like the\r\nvery nation.  He had a low-cut vest on, which exposed a deal of frayed\r\nand broken and unclean shirtfront.  Showy studs, of imitation gold--they\r\nhad made black disks on the linen.  Oversized sleeve buttons of imitation\r\ngold, the copper base showing through.  Ponderous watch-chain of\r\nimitation gold.  I judge that he couldn't tell the time by it, for he\r\nasked Smythe what time it was, once.  He wore a coat which had been gay\r\nwhen it was young; 5-o'clock-tea-trousers of a light tint, and\r\nmarvelously soiled; yellow mustache with a dashing upward whirl at the\r\nends; foxy shoes, imitation patent leather.  He was a novelty--an\r\nimitation dude.  He would have been a real one if he could have afforded\r\nit.  But he was satisfied with himself.  You could see it in his\r\nexpression, and in all his attitudes and movements.  He was living in a\r\ndude dreamland where all his squalid shams were genuine, and himself a\r\nsincerity.  It disarmed criticism, it mollified spite, to see him so\r\nenjoy his imitation languors, and arts, and airs, and his studied\r\ndaintinesses of gesture and misbegotten refinements.  It was plain to me\r\nthat he was imagining himself the Prince of Wales, and was doing\r\neverything the way he thought the Prince would do it.  For bringing his\r\nfour valises aboard and stowing them in the nettings, he gave his porter\r\nfour cents, and lightly apologized for the smallness of the gratuity\r\n--just with the condescendingest little royal air in the world.  He\r\nstretched himself out on the front seat and rested his pomatum-cake on\r\nthe middle arm, and stuck his feet out of the window, and began to pose\r\nas the Prince and work his dreams and languors for exhibition; and he\r\nwould indolently watch the blue films curling up from his cigarette, and\r\ninhale the stench, and look so grateful; and would flip the ash away with\r\nthe daintiest gesture, unintentionally displaying his brass ring in the\r\nmost intentional way; why, it was as good as being in Marlborough House\r\nitself to see him do it so like.\r\n\r\nThere was other scenery in the trip.  That of the Hawksbury river, in the\r\nNational Park region, fine--extraordinarily fine, with spacious views of\r\nstream and lake imposingly framed in woody hills; and every now and then\r\nthe noblest groupings of mountains, and the most enchanting\r\nrearrangements of the water effects.  Further along, green flats, thinly\r\ncovered with gum forests, with here and there the huts and cabins of\r\nsmall farmers engaged in raising children.  Still further along, arid\r\nstretches, lifeless and melancholy.  Then Newcastle, a rushing town,\r\ncapital of the rich coal regions.  Approaching Scone, wide farming and\r\ngrazing levels, with pretty frequent glimpses of a troublesome plant--a\r\nparticularly devilish little prickly pear, daily damned in the orisons of\r\nthe agriculturist; imported by a lady of sentiment, and contributed\r\ngratis to the colony. Blazing hot, all day.\r\n\r\nDecember 20.  Back to Sydney.  Blazing hot again.  From the newspaper,\r\nand from the map, I have made a collection of curious names of\r\nAustralasian towns, with the idea of making a poem out of them:\r\n\r\nTumut\r\nTakee\r\nMurriwillumba\r\nBowral\r\nBallarat\r\nMullengudgery\r\nMurrurundi\r\nWagga-Wagga\r\nWyalong\r\nMurrumbidgee\r\nGoomeroo\r\nWolloway\r\nWangary\r\nWanilla\r\nWorrow\r\nKoppio\r\nYankalilla\r\nYaranyacka\r\nYackamoorundie\r\nKaiwaka\r\nCoomooroo\r\nTauranga\r\nGeelong\r\nTongariro\r\nKaikoura\r\nWakatipu\r\nOohipara\r\nWaitpinga\r\nGoelwa\r\nMunno Para\r\nNangkita\r\nMyponga\r\nKapunda\r\nKooringa\r\nPenola\r\nNangwarry\r\nKongorong\r\nComaum\r\nKoolywurtie\r\nKillanoola\r\nNaracoorte\r\nMuloowurtie\r\nBinnum\r\nWallaroo\r\nWirrega\r\nMundoora\r\nHauraki\r\nRangiriri\r\nTeawamute\r\nTaranaki\r\nToowoomba\r\nGoondiwindi\r\nJerrilderie\r\nWhangaroa\r\nWollongong\r\nWoolloomooloo\r\nBombola\r\nCoolgardie\r\nBendigo\r\nCoonamble\r\nCootamundra\r\nWoolgoolga\r\n\r\nMittagong\r\nJamberoo\r\nKondoparinga\r\nKuitpo\r\nTungkillo\r\nOukaparinga\r\nTalunga\r\nYatala\r\nParawirra\r\nMoorooroo\r\nWhangarei\r\nWoolundunga\r\nBooleroo\r\nPernatty\r\nParramatta\r\nTaroom\r\nNarrandera\r\nDeniliquin\r\nKawakawa.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be best to build the poem now, and make the weather help\r\n\r\n                    A SWELTERING DAY IN AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\n          (To be read soft and low, with the lights turned down.)\r\n\r\n               The Bombola faints in the hot Bowral tree,\r\n               Where fierce Mullengudgery's smothering fires\r\n               Far from the breezes of Coolgardie\r\n               Burn ghastly and blue as the day expires;\r\n\r\n               And Murriwillumba complaineth in song\r\n               For the garlanded bowers of Woolloomooloo,\r\n               And the Ballarat Fly and the lone Wollongong\r\n               They dream of the gardens of Jamberoo;\r\n\r\n               The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgee,\r\n               For the velvety sod of the Munno Parah,\r\n               Where the waters of healing from Muloowurtie\r\n               Flow dim in the gloaming by Yaranyackah;\r\n\r\n               The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway,\r\n               And sigheth in secret for Murrurundi,\r\n               The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day\r\n               That made him an exile from Jerrilderie;\r\n\r\n               The Teawamute Tumut from Wirrega's glade,\r\n               The Nangkita swallow, the Wallaroo swan,\r\n               They long for the peace of the Timaru shade\r\n               And thy balmy soft airs, O sweet Mittagong!\r\n\r\n               The Kooringa buffalo pants in the sun,\r\n               The Kondoparinga lies gaping for breath,\r\n               The Kongorong Camaum to the shadow has won,\r\n               But the Goomeroo sinks in the slumber of death;\r\n\r\n               In the weltering hell of the Moorooroo plain\r\n               The Yatala Wangary withers and dies,\r\n               And the Worrow Wanilla, demented with pain,\r\n               To the Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies;\r\n\r\n               Sweet Nangwarry's desolate, Coonamble wails,\r\n               And Tungkillo Kuito in sables is drest,\r\n               For the Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails\r\n               And the Booleroo life-breeze is dead in the west.\r\n\r\n               Mypongo, Kapunda, O slumber no more\r\n               Yankalilla, Parawirra, be warned\r\n               There's death in the air!\r\n               Killanoola, wherefore\r\n               Shall the prayer of Penola be scorned?\r\n\r\n               Cootamundra, and Takee, and Wakatipu,\r\n               Toowoomba, Kaikoura are lost\r\n               From Onkaparinga to far Oamaru\r\n               All burn in this hell's holocaust!\r\n\r\n               Paramatta and Binnum are gone to their rest\r\n               In the vale of Tapanni Taroom,\r\n               Kawakawa, Deniliquin--all that was best\r\n               In the earth are but graves and a tomb!\r\n\r\n               Narrandera mourns, Cameron answers not\r\n               When the roll of the scathless we cry\r\n               Tongariro, Goondiwindi, Woolundunga, the spot\r\n               Is mute and forlorn where ye lie.\r\n\r\nThose are good words for poetry.

I did not need them all, but I have knocked\r\ndown 66 of them; which is a good bag, it seems to me, for a person not in\r\nthe business.  Perhaps a poet laureate could do better, but a poet\r\nlaureate gets wages, and that is different.  When I write poetry I do not\r\nget any wages; often I lose money by it.  The best word in that list, and\r\nthe most musical and gurgly, is Woolloomoolloo.  It is a place near\r\nSydney, and is a favorite pleasure-resort.  It has eight O's in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTo succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown; in the law,\r\nconcealment of it will do.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nMONDAY,--December 23, 1895.  Sailed from Sydney for Ceylon in the P. & O.\r\nsteamer 'Oceana'.  A Lascar crew mans this ship--the first I have seen.\r\nWhite cotton petticoat and pants; barefoot; red shawl for belt; straw\r\ncap, brimless, on head, with red scarf wound around it; complexion a rich\r\ndark brown; short straight black hair; whiskers fine and silky; lustrous\r\nand intensely black.  Mild, good faces; willing and obedient people;\r\ncapable, too; but are said to go into hopeless panics when there is\r\ndanger.  They are from Bombay and the coast thereabouts.  Left some of\r\nthe trunks in Sydney, to be shipped to South Africa by a vessel\r\nadvertised to sail three months hence.  The proverb says: \xe2\x80\x9cSeparate not\r\nyourself from your baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis 'Oceana' is a stately big ship, luxuriously appointed.  She has\r\nspacious promenade decks.  Large rooms; a surpassingly comfortable ship.\r\nThe officers' library is well selected; a ship's library is not usually\r\nthat .  .  .  .  For meals, the bugle call, man-of-war fashion; a\r\npleasant change from the terrible gong .  .  .  .  Three big cats--very\r\nfriendly loafers; they wander all over the ship; the white one follows\r\nthe chief steward around like a dog.  There is also a basket of kittens.\r\nOne of these cats goes ashore, in port, in England, Australia, and India,\r\nto see how his various families are getting along, and is seen no more\r\ntill the ship is ready to sail.  No one knows how he finds out the\r\nsailing date, but no doubt he comes down to the dock every day and takes\r\na look, and when he sees baggage and passengers flocking in, recognizes\r\nthat it is time to get aboard.  This is what the sailors believe.  The\r\nChief Engineer has been in the China and India trade thirty three years,\r\nand has had but three Christmases at home in that time .  .  .  .\r\nConversational items at dinner, \xe2\x80\x9cMocha! sold all over the world!  It is\r\nnot true.  In fact, very few foreigners except the Emperor of Russia have\r\never seen a grain of it, or ever will, while they live.\xe2\x80\x9d  Another man\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no sale in Australia for Australian wine.  But it goes to\r\nFrance and comes back with a French label on it, and then they buy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I have heard that the most of the French-labeled claret in New York is\r\nmade in California.  And I remember what Professor S. told me once about\r\nVeuve Cliquot--if that was the wine, and I think it was.  He was the\r\nguest of a great wine merchant whose town was quite near that vineyard,\r\nand this merchant asked him if very much V. C. was drunk in America.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said S., \xe2\x80\x9ca great abundance of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it easy to be had?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes--easy as water.  All first and second-class hotels have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you pay for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt depends on the style of the hotel--from fifteen to twenty-five francs\r\na bottle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, fortunate country!  Why, it's worth 100 francs right here on the\r\nground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean that we are drinking a bogus Veuve-Cliquot over there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--and there was never a bottle of the genuine in America since\r\nColumbus's time.  That wine all comes from a little bit of a patch of\r\nground which isn't big enough to raise many bottles; and all of it that\r\nis produced goes every year to one person--the Emperor of Russia.  He\r\ntakes the whole crop in advance, be it big or little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJanuary 4, 1896.   Christmas in Melbourne, New Year's Day in Adelaide,\r\nand saw most of the friends again in both places .  .  .  .  Lying here\r\nat anchor all day--Albany (King George's Sound), Western Australia.  It\r\nis a perfectly landlocked harbor, or roadstead--spacious to look at, but\r\nnot deep water.  Desolate-looking rocks and scarred hills.  Plenty of\r\nships arriving now, rushing to the new gold-fields.  The papers are full\r\nof wonderful tales of the sort always to be heard in connection with new\r\ngold diggings.  A sample: a youth staked out a claim and tried to sell\r\nhalf for L5; no takers; he stuck to it fourteen days, starving, then\r\nstruck it rich and sold out for L10,000 .  .  .  . About sunset, strong\r\nbreeze blowing, got up the anchor.  We were in a small deep puddle, with\r\na narrow channel leading out of it, minutely buoyed, to the sea.\r\n\r\nI stayed on deck to see how we were going to manage it with such a big\r\nship and such a strong wind.  On the bridge our giant captain, in\r\nuniform; at his side a little pilot in elaborately gold-laced uniform; on\r\nthe forecastle a white mate and quartermaster or two, and a brilliant\r\ncrowd of lascars standing by for business.  Our stern was pointing\r\nstraight at the head of the channel; so we must turn entirely around in\r\nthe puddle--and the wind blowing as described.  It was done, and\r\nbeautifully.  It was done by help of a jib.  We stirred up much mud, but\r\ndid not touch the bottom.  We turned right around in our tracks--a\r\nseeming impossibility.  We had several casts of quarter-less 5, and one\r\ncast of half 4--27 feet; we were drawing 26 astern.  By the time we were\r\nentirely around and pointed, the first buoy was not more than a hundred\r\nyards in front of us.  It was a fine piece of work, and I was the only\r\npassenger that saw it.  However, the others got their dinner; the P. & O.\r\nCompany got mine .  .  .  .  More cats developed.  Smythe says it is a\r\nBritish law that they must be carried; and he instanced a case of a ship\r\nnot allowed to sail till she sent for a couple.  The bill came, too:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDebtor, to 2 cats, 20 shillings.\xe2\x80\x9d .  .  .  News comes that within this\r\nweek Siam has acknowledged herself to be, in effect, a French province.\r\nIt seems plain that all savage and semi-civilized countries are going to\r\nbe grabbed .  .  .  .  A vulture on board; bald, red, queer-shaped head,\r\nfeatherless red places here and there on his body, intense great black\r\neyes set in featherless rims of inflamed flesh; dissipated look; a\r\nbusinesslike style, a selfish, conscienceless, murderous aspect--the very\r\nlook of a professional assassin, and yet a bird which does no murder.\r\nWhat was the use of getting him up in that tragic style for so innocent a\r\ntrade as his?  For this one isn't the sort that wars upon the living, his\r\ndiet is offal--and the more out of date it is the better he likes it.\r\nNature should give him a suit of rusty black; then he would be all right,\r\nfor he would look like an undertaker and would harmonize with his\r\nbusiness; whereas the way he is now he is horribly out of true.\r\n\r\nJanuary 5.   At 9 this morning we passed Cape Leeuwin (lioness) and\r\nceased from our long due-west course along the southern shore of\r\nAustralia.  Turning this extreme southwestern corner, we now take a long\r\nstraight slant nearly N. W., without a break, for Ceylon.  As we speed\r\nnorthward it will grow hotter very fast--but it isn't chilly, now. . . .\r\nThe vulture is from the public menagerie at Adelaide--a great and\r\ninteresting collection.  It was there that we saw the baby tiger solemnly\r\nspreading its mouth and trying to roar like its majestic mother.  It\r\nswaggered, scowling, back and forth on its short legs just as it had seen\r\nher do on her long ones, and now and then snarling viciously, exposing\r\nits teeth, with a threatening lift of its upper lip and bristling\r\nmoustache; and when it thought it was impressing the visitors, it would\r\nspread its mouth wide and do that screechy cry which it meant for a roar,\r\nbut which did not deceive.  It took itself quite seriously, and was\r\nlovably comical.  And there was a hyena--an ugly creature; as ugly as the\r\ntiger-kitty was pretty.  It repeatedly arched its back and delivered\r\nitself of such a human cry; a startling resemblance; a cry which was just\r\nthat of a grown person badly hurt.  In the dark one would assuredly go to\r\nits assistance--and be disappointed .  .  .  .  Many friends of\r\nAustralasian Federation on board.  They feel sure that the good day is\r\nnot far off, now.  But there seems to be a party that would go further\r\n--have Australasia cut loose from the British Empire and set up\r\nhousekeeping on her own hook.  It seems an unwise idea.  They point to\r\nthe United States, but it seems to me that the cases lack a good deal of\r\nbeing alike.  Australasia governs herself wholly--there is no\r\ninterference; and her commerce and manufactures are not oppressed in any\r\nway.  If our case had been the same we should not have gone out when we\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 13.   Unspeakably hot.  The equator is arriving again.  We are\r\nwithin eight degrees of it.  Ceylon present.  Dear me, it is beautiful!\r\nAnd most sumptuously tropical, as to character of foliage and opulence of\r\nit.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat though the spicy breezes blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle\xe2\x80\x9d--an\r\neloquent line, an incomparable line; it says little, but conveys whole\r\nlibraries of sentiment, and Oriental charm and mystery, and tropic\r\ndeliciousness--a line that quivers and tingles with a thousand\r\nunexpressed and inexpressible things, things that haunt one and find no\r\narticulate voice .  .  .  .  Colombo, the capital.  An Oriental town,\r\nmost manifestly; and fascinating.\r\n\r\nIn this palatial ship the passengers dress for dinner.  The ladies'\r\ntoilettes make a fine display of color, and this is in keeping with the\r\nelegance of the vessel's furnishings and the flooding brilliancies of the\r\nelectric light.  On the stormy Atlantic one never sees a man in evening\r\ndress, except at the rarest intervals; and then there is only one, not\r\ntwo; and he shows up but once on the voyage--the night before the ship\r\nmakes port--the night when they have the \xe2\x80\x9cconcert\xe2\x80\x9d and do the amateur\r\nwailings and recitations.  He is the tenor, as a rule .  .  .  .  There\r\nhas been a deal of cricket-playing on board; it seems a queer game for a\r\nship, but they enclose the promenade deck with nettings and keep the ball\r\nfrom flying overboard, and the sport goes very well, and is properly\r\nviolent and exciting .  .  .  .  We must part from this vessel here.\r\n\r\nJanuary 14.   Hotel Bristol.  Servant Brompy.  Alert, gentle, smiling,\r\nwinning young brown creature as ever was.  Beautiful shining black hair\r\ncombed back like a woman's, and knotted at the back of his head\r\n--tortoise-shell comb in it, sign that he is a Singhalese; slender,\r\nshapely\r\nform; jacket; under it is a beltless and flowing white cotton gown--from\r\nneck straight to heel; he and his outfit quite unmasculine.  It was an\r\nembarrassment to undress before him.\r\n\r\nWe drove to the market, using the Japanese jinriksha--our first\r\nacquaintanceship with it.  It is a light cart, with a native to draw it.\r\nHe makes good speed for half-an-hour, but it is hard work for him; he is\r\ntoo slight for it.  After the half-hour there is no more pleasure for\r\nyou; your attention is all on the man, just as it would be on a tired\r\nhorse, and necessarily your sympathy is there too.  There's a plenty of\r\nthese 'rickshas, and the tariff is incredibly cheap.\r\n\r\nI was in Cairo years ago.  That was Oriental, but there was a lack.  When\r\nyou are in Florida or New Orleans you are in the South--that is granted;\r\nbut you are not in the South; you are in a modified South, a tempered\r\nSouth.  Cairo was a tempered Orient--an Orient with an indefinite\r\nsomething wanting.  That feeling was not present in Ceylon.  Ceylon was\r\nOriental in the last measure of completeness--utterly Oriental; also\r\nutterly tropical; and indeed to one's unreasoning spiritual sense the two\r\nthings belong together.  All the requisites were present.  The costumes\r\nwere right; the black and brown exposures, unconscious of immodesty, were\r\nright; the juggler was there, with his basket, his snakes, his mongoose,\r\nand his arrangements for growing a tree from seed to foliage and ripe\r\nfruitage before one's eyes; in sight were plants and flowers familiar to\r\none on books but in no other way--celebrated, desirable, strange, but in\r\nproduction restricted to the hot belt of the equator; and out a little\r\nway in the country were the proper deadly snakes, and fierce beasts of\r\nprey, and the wild elephant and the monkey.  And there was that swoon in\r\nthe air which one associates with the tropics, and that smother of heat,\r\nheavy with odors of unknown flowers, and that sudden invasion of purple\r\ngloom fissured with lightnings,--then the tumult of crashing thunder and\r\nthe downpour and presently all sunny and smiling again; all these things\r\nwere there; the conditions were complete, nothing was lacking.  And away\r\noff in the deeps of the jungle and in the remotenesses of the mountains\r\nwere the ruined cities and mouldering temples, mysterious relics of the\r\npomps of a forgotten time and a vanished race--and this was as it should\r\nbe, also, for nothing is quite satisfyingly Oriental that lacks the\r\nsomber and impressive qualities of mystery and antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe drive through the town and out to the Galle Face by the seashore,\r\nwhat a dream it was of tropical splendors of bloom and blossom, and\r\nOriental conflagrations of costume!  The walking groups of men, women,\r\nboys, girls, babies--each individual was a flame, each group a house\r\nafire for color.  And such stunning colors, such intensely vivid colors,\r\nsuch rich and exquisite minglings and fusings of rainbows and lightnings!\r\nAnd all harmonious, all in perfect taste; never a discordant note; never\r\na color on any person swearing at another color on him or failing to\r\nharmonize faultlessly with the colors of any group the wearer might join.\r\nThe stuffs were silk--thin, soft, delicate, clinging; and, as a rule,\r\neach\r\npiece a solid color: a splendid green, a splendid blue, a splendid\r\nyellow, a splendid purple, a splendid ruby, deep, and rich with\r\nsmouldering fires--they swept continuously by in crowds and legions and\r\nmultitudes, glowing, flashing, burning, radiant; and every five seconds\r\ncame a burst of blinding red that made a body catch his breath, and\r\nfilled his heart with joy.  And then, the unimaginable grace of those\r\ncostumes!  Sometimes a woman's whole dress was but a scarf wound about\r\nher person and her head, sometimes a man's was but a turban and a\r\ncareless rag or two--in both cases generous areas of polished dark skin\r\nshowing--but always the arrangement compelled the homage of the eye and\r\nmade the heart sing for gladness.\r\n\r\nI can see it to this day, that radiant panorama, that wilderness of rich\r\ncolor, that incomparable dissolving-view of harmonious tints, and lithe\r\nhalf-covered forms, and beautiful brown faces, and gracious and graceful\r\ngestures and attitudes and movements, free, unstudied, barren of\r\nstiffness and restraint, and--\r\n\r\nJust then, into this dream of fairyland and paradise a grating dissonance\r\nwas injected.\r\n\r\nOut of a missionary school came marching, two and two, sixteen prim and\r\npious little Christian black girls, Europeanly clothed--dressed, to the\r\nlast detail, as they would have been dressed on a summer Sunday in an\r\nEnglish or American village.  Those clothes--oh, they were unspeakably\r\nugly!  Ugly, barbarous, destitute of taste, destitute of grace, repulsive\r\nas a shroud.  I looked at my womenfolk's clothes--just full-grown\r\nduplicates of the outrages disguising those poor little abused creatures\r\n--and was ashamed to be seen in the street with them.  Then I looked at\r\nmy own clothes, and was ashamed to be seen in the street with myself.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must put up with our clothes as they are--they have their\r\nreason for existing.  They are on us to expose us--to advertise what we\r\nwear them to conceal.  They are a sign; a sign of insincerity; a sign of\r\nsuppressed vanity; a pretense that we despise gorgeous colors and the\r\ngraces of harmony and form; and we put them on to propagate that lie and\r\nback it up.  But we do not deceive our neighbor; and when we step into\r\nCeylon we realize that we have not even deceived ourselves.  We do love\r\nbrilliant colors and graceful costumes; and at home we will turn out in a\r\nstorm to see them when the procession goes by--and envy the wearers.  We\r\ngo to the theater to look at them and grieve that we can't be clothed\r\nlike that.  We go to the King's ball, when we get a chance, and are glad\r\nof a sight of the splendid uniforms and the glittering orders.  When we\r\nare granted permission to attend an imperial drawing-room we shut\r\nourselves up in private and parade around in the theatrical court-dress\r\nby the hour, and admire ourselves in the glass, and are utterly happy;\r\nand every member of every governor's staff in democratic America does the\r\nsame with his grand new uniform--and if he is not watched he will get\r\nhimself photographed in it, too.  When I see the Lord Mayor's footman I\r\nam dissatisfied with my lot.  Yes, our clothes are a lie, and have been\r\nnothing short of that these hundred years.  They are insincere, they are\r\nthe ugly and appropriate outward exposure of an inward sham and a moral\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nThe last little brown boy I chanced to notice in the crowds and swarms of\r\nColombo had nothing on but a twine string around his waist, but in my\r\nmemory the frank honesty of his costume still stands out in pleasant\r\ncontrast with the odious flummery in which the little Sunday-school\r\ndowdies were masquerading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nProsperity is the best protector of principle.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nEVENING--14th.   Sailed in the Rosetta.  This is a poor old ship, and\r\nought to be insured and sunk.  As in the 'Oceana', just so here:\r\neverybody dresses for dinner; they make it a sort of pious duty.  These\r\nfine and formal costumes are a rather conspicuous contrast to the poverty\r\nand shabbiness of the surroundings .  .  .  .  If you want a slice of a\r\nlime at four o'clock tea, you must sign an order on the bar.  Limes cost\r\n14 cents a barrel.\r\n\r\nJanuary 18th.   We have been running up the Arabian Sea, latterly.\r\nClosing up on Bombay now, and due to arrive this evening.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20th.   Bombay!  A bewitching place, a bewildering place, an\r\nenchanting place--the Arabian Nights come again?  It is a vast city;\r\ncontains about a million inhabitants.  Natives, they are, with a slight\r\nsprinkling of white people--not enough to have the slightest modifying\r\neffect upon the massed dark complexion of the public.  It is winter here,\r\nyet the weather is the divine weather of June, and the foliage is the\r\nfresh and heavenly foliage of June.  There is a rank of noble great shade\r\ntrees across the way from the hotel, and under them sit groups of\r\npicturesque natives of both sexes; and the juggler in his turban is there\r\nwith his snakes and his magic; and all day long the cabs and the\r\nmultitudinous varieties of costumes flock by.  It does not seem as if one\r\ncould ever get tired of watching this moving show, this shining and\r\nshifting spectacle .  .  .  .  In the great bazar the pack and jam of\r\nnatives was marvelous, the sea of rich-colored turbans and draperies an\r\ninspiring sight, and the quaint and showy Indian architecture was just\r\nthe right setting for it.  Toward sunset another show; this is the drive\r\naround the sea-shore to Malabar Point, where Lord Sandhurst, the Governor\r\nof the Bombay Presidency, lives.  Parsee palaces all along the first part\r\nof the drive; and past them all the world is driving; the private\r\ncarriages of wealthy Englishmen and natives of rank are manned by a\r\ndriver and three footmen in stunning oriental liveries--two of these\r\nturbaned statues standing up behind, as fine as monuments.  Sometimes\r\neven the public carriages have this superabundant crew, slightly\r\nmodified--one to drive, one to sit by and see it done, and one to stand\r\nup behind and yell--yell when there is anybody in the way, and for\r\npractice when there isn't.  It all helps to keep up the liveliness and\r\naugment the general sense of swiftness and energy and confusion and\r\npow-wow.\r\n\r\nIn the region of Scandal Point--felicitous name--where there are handy\r\nrocks to sit on and a noble view of the sea on the one hand, and on the\r\nother the passing and repassing whirl and tumult of gay carriages, are\r\ngreat groups of comfortably-off Parsee women--perfect flower-beds of\r\nbrilliant color, a fascinating spectacle.  Tramp, tramp, tramping along\r\nthe road, in singles, couples, groups, and gangs, you have the\r\nworking-man and the working-woman--but not clothed like ours.  Usually\r\nthe man is a nobly-built great athlete, with not a rag on but his\r\nloin-handkerchief; his color a deep dark brown, his skin satin, his\r\nrounded muscles knobbing it as if it had eggs under it.  Usually the\r\nwoman is a slender and shapely creature, as erect as a lightning-rod, and\r\nshe has but one thing on--a bright-colored piece of stuff which is wound\r\nabout her head and her body down nearly half-way to her knees, and which\r\nclings like her own skin.  Her legs and feet are bare, and so are her\r\narms, except for her fanciful bunches of loose silver rings on her ankles\r\nand on her arms. She has jewelry bunched on the side of her nose also,\r\nand showy clusterings on her toes.  When she undresses for bed she takes\r\noff her jewelry, I suppose.  If she took off anything more she would\r\ncatch cold. As a rule she has a large shiney brass water jar of graceful\r\nshape on her head, and one of her naked arms curves up and the hand holds\r\nit there. She is so straight, so erect, and she steps with such style,\r\nand such easy grace and dignity; and her curved arm and her brazen jar\r\nare such a help to the picture--indeed, our working-women cannot begin\r\nwith her as a road-decoration.\r\n\r\nIt is all color, bewitching color, enchanting color--everywhere all\r\naround--all the way around the curving great opaline bay clear to\r\nGovernment House, where the turbaned big native 'chuprassies' stand\r\ngrouped in state at the door in their robes of fiery red, and do most\r\nproperly and stunningly finish up the splendid show and make it\r\ntheatrically complete.  I wish I were a 'chuprassy'.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed India! the land of dreams and romance, of fabulous wealth\r\nand fabulous poverty, of splendor and rags, of palaces and hovels, of\r\nfamine and pestilence, of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps, of tigers\r\nand elephants, the cobra and the jungle, the country of a hundred nations\r\nand a hundred tongues, of a thousand religions and two million gods,\r\ncradle of the human race, birthplace of human speech, mother of history,\r\ngrandmother of legend, great-grandmother of tradition, whose yesterdays\r\nbear date with the mouldering antiquities of the rest of the nations--the\r\none sole country under the sun that is endowed with an imperishable\r\ninterest for alien prince and alien peasant, for lettered and ignorant,\r\nwise and fool, rich and poor, bond and free, the one land that all men\r\ndesire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, would not give\r\nthat glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the globe combined.\r\nEven now, after the lapse of a year, the delirium of those days in Bombay\r\nhas not left me, and I hope never will.  It was all new, no detail of it\r\nhackneyed.  And India did not wait for morning, it began at the hotel\r\n--straight away.  The lobbies and halls were full of turbaned, and fez'd\r\nand embroidered, cap'd, and barefooted, and cotton-clad dark natives,\r\nsome of them rushing about, others at rest squatting, or sitting on the\r\nground; some of them chattering with energy, others still and dreamy; in\r\nthe dining-room every man's own private native servant standing behind\r\nhis chair, and dressed for a part in the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nOur rooms were high up, on the front.  A white man--he was a burly German\r\n--went up with us, and brought three natives along to see to arranging\r\nthings.  About fourteen others followed in procession, with the\r\nhand-baggage; each carried an article--and only one; a bag, in some\r\ncases, in other cases less.  One strong native carried my overcoat,\r\nanother a parasol, another a box of cigars, another a novel, and the last\r\nman in the procession had no load but a fan.  It was all done with\r\nearnestness and sincerity, there was not a smile in the procession from\r\nthe head of it to the tail of it.  Each man waited patiently, tranquilly,\r\nin no sort of hurry, till one of us found time to give him a copper, then\r\nhe bent his head reverently, touched his forehead with his fingers, and\r\nwent his way.  They seemed a soft and gentle race, and there was\r\nsomething both winning and touching about their demeanor.\r\n\r\nThere was a vast glazed door which opened upon the balcony.  It needed\r\nclosing, or cleaning, or something, and a native got down on his knees\r\nand went to work at it.  He seemed to be doing it well enough, but\r\nperhaps he wasn't, for the burly German put on a look that betrayed\r\ndissatisfaction, then without explaining what was wrong, gave the native\r\na brisk cuff on the jaw and then told him where the defect was.  It\r\nseemed such a shame to do that before us all.  The native took it with\r\nmeekness, saying nothing, and not showing in his face or manner any\r\nresentment.  I had not seen the like of this for fifty years.  It carried\r\nme back to my boyhood, and flashed upon me the forgotten fact that this\r\nwas the usual way of explaining one's desires to a slave.  I was able to\r\nremember that the method seemed right and natural to me in those days, I\r\nbeing born to it and unaware that elsewhere there were other methods; but\r\nI was also able to remember that those unresented cuffings made me sorry\r\nfor the victim and ashamed for the punisher.  My father was a refined and\r\nkindly gentleman, very grave, rather austere, of rigid probity, a sternly\r\njust and upright man, albeit he attended no church and never spoke of\r\nreligious matters, and had no part nor lot in the pious joys of his\r\nPresbyterian family, nor ever seemed to suffer from this deprivation.  He\r\nlaid his hand upon me in punishment only twice in his life, and then not\r\nheavily; once for telling him a lie--which surprised me, and showed me\r\nhow unsuspicious he was, for that was not my maiden effort.  He punished\r\nme those two times only, and never any other member of the family at all;\r\nyet every now and then he cuffed our harmless slave boy, Lewis, for\r\ntrifling little blunders and awkwardnesses.  My father had passed his\r\nlife\r\namong the slaves from his cradle up, and his cuffings proceeded from the\r\ncustom of the time, not from his nature.  When I was ten years old I saw\r\na man fling a lump of iron-ore at a slaveman in anger, for merely doing\r\nsomething awkwardly--as if that were a crime.  It bounded from the man's\r\nskull, and the man fell and never spoke again.  He was dead in an hour.\r\nI knew the man had a right to kill his slave if he wanted to, and yet it\r\nseemed a pitiful thing and somehow wrong, though why wrong I was not deep\r\nenough to explain if I had been asked to do it.  Nobody in the village\r\napproved of that murder, but of course no one said much about it.\r\n\r\nIt is curious--the space-annihilating power of thought.  For just one\r\nsecond, all that goes to make the me in me was in a Missourian village,\r\non the other side of the globe, vividly seeing again these forgotten\r\npictures of fifty years ago, and wholly unconscious of all things but\r\njust those; and in the next second I was back in Bombay, and that\r\nkneeling native's smitten cheek was not done tingling yet!  Back to\r\nboyhood--fifty years; back to age again, another fifty; and a flight\r\nequal to the circumference of the globe-all in two seconds by the watch!\r\n\r\nSome natives--I don't remember how many--went into my bedroom, now, and\r\nput things to rights and arranged the mosquito-bar, and I went to bed to\r\nnurse my cough.  It was about nine in the evening.  What a state of\r\nthings!  For three hours the yelling and shouting of natives in the hall\r\ncontinued, along with the velvety patter of their swift bare feet--what a\r\nracket it was!  They were yelling orders and messages down three flights.\r\nWhy, in the matter of noise it amounted to a riot, an insurrection, a\r\nrevolution.  And then there were other noises mixed up with these and at\r\nintervals tremendously accenting them--roofs falling in, I judged,\r\nwindows smashing, persons being murdered, crows squawking, and deriding,\r\nand cursing, canaries screeching, monkeys jabbering, macaws blaspheming,\r\nand every now and then fiendish bursts of laughter and explosions of\r\ndynamite.  By midnight I had suffered all the different kinds of shocks\r\nthere are, and knew that I could never more be disturbed by them, either\r\nisolated or in combination.  Then came peace--stillness deep and solemn\r\nand lasted till five.\r\n\r\nThen it all broke loose again.  And who re-started it?  The Bird of Birds\r\nthe Indian crow.  I came to know him well, by and by, and be infatuated\r\nwith him.  I suppose he is the hardest lot that wears feathers.  Yes, and\r\nthe cheerfulest, and the best satisfied with himself.  He never arrived\r\nat what he is by any careless process, or any sudden one; he is a work of\r\nart, and \xe2\x80\x9cart is long\xe2\x80\x9d; he is the product of immemorial ages, and of deep\r\ncalculation; one can't make a bird like that in a day.  He has been\r\nreincarnated more times than Shiva; and he has kept a sample of each\r\nincarnation, and fused it into his constitution.  In the course of his\r\nevolutionary promotions, his sublime march toward ultimate perfection, he\r\nhas been a gambler, a low comedian, a dissolute priest, a fussy woman, a\r\nblackguard, a scoffer, a liar, a thief, a spy, an informer, a trading\r\npolitician, a swindler, a professional hypocrite, a patriot for cash, a\r\nreformer, a lecturer, a lawyer, a conspirator, a rebel, a royalist, a\r\ndemocrat, a practicer and propagator of irreverence, a meddler, an\r\nintruder, a busybody, an infidel, and a wallower in sin for the mere love\r\nof it.  The strange result, the incredible result, of this patient\r\naccumulation of all damnable traits is, that he does not know what care\r\nis, he does not know what sorrow is, he does not know what remorse is,\r\nhis life is one long thundering ecstasy of happiness, and he will go to\r\nhis death untroubled, knowing that he will soon turn up again as an\r\nauthor or something, and be even more intolerably capable and comfortable\r\nthan ever he was before.\r\n\r\nIn his straddling wide forward-step, and his springy side-wise series of\r\nhops, and his impudent air, and his cunning way of canting his head to\r\none side upon occasion, he reminds one of the American blackbird.  But\r\nthe sharp resemblances stop there.  He is much bigger than the blackbird;\r\nand he lacks the blackbird's trim and slender and beautiful build and\r\nshapely beak; and of course his sober garb of gray and rusty black is a\r\npoor and humble thing compared with the splendid lustre of the\r\nblackbird's metallic sables and shifting and flashing bronze glories.\r\nThe blackbird is a perfect gentleman, in deportment and attire, and is\r\nnot noisy, I believe, except when holding religious services and\r\npolitical conventions in a tree; but this Indian sham Quaker is just a\r\nrowdy, and is always noisy when awake--always chaffing, scolding,\r\nscoffing, laughing, ripping, and cursing, and carrying on about something\r\nor other.  I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions.  Nothing\r\nescapes him; he notices everything that happens, and brings out his\r\nopinion about it, particularly if it is a matter that is none of his\r\nbusiness.  And it is never a mild opinion, but always violent--violent\r\nand profane--the presence of ladies does not affect him.  His opinions\r\nare not the outcome of reflection, for he never thinks about anything,\r\nbut heaves out the opinion that is on top in his mind, and which is often\r\nan opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit the case.\r\nBut that is his way; his main idea is to get out an opinion, and if he\r\nstopped to think he would lose chances.\r\n\r\nI suppose he has no enemies among men.  The whites and Mohammedans never\r\nseemed to molest him; and the Hindoos, because of their religion, never\r\ntake the life of any creature, but spare even the snakes and tigers and\r\nfleas and rats.  If I sat on one end of the balcony, the crows would\r\ngather on the railing at the other end and talk about me; and edge\r\ncloser, little by little, till I could almost reach them; and they would\r\nsit there, in the most unabashed way, and talk about my clothes, and my\r\nhair, and my complexion, and probable character and vocation and\r\npolitics, and how I came to be in India, and what I  had been doing, and\r\nhow many days I had got for it, and how I had happened to go unhanged\r\nso long, and when would it probably come off, and might there be more of\r\nmy sort where I came from, and when would they be hanged,--and so on, and\r\nso on, until I could not longer endure the embarrassment of it; then I\r\nwould shoo them away, and they would circle around in the air a little\r\nwhile, laughing and deriding and mocking, and presently settle on the\r\nrail and do it all over again.\r\n\r\nThey were very sociable when there was anything to eat--oppressively so.\r\nWith a little encouragement they would come in and light on the table and\r\nhelp me eat my breakfast; and once when I was in the other room and they\r\nfound themselves alone, they carried off everything they could lift; and\r\nthey were particular to choose things which they could make no use of\r\nafter they got them.  In India their number is beyond estimate, and their\r\nnoise is in proportion.  I suppose they cost the country more than the\r\ngovernment does; yet that is not a light matter.  Still, they pay; their\r\ncompany pays; it would sadden the land to take their cheerful voice out\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nBy trying we can easily learn to endure adversity.  Another man's,\r\nI mean.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nYou soon find your long-ago dreams of India rising in a sort of vague and\r\nluscious moonlight above the horizon-rim of your opaque consciousness,\r\nand softly lighting up a thousand forgotten details which were parts of a\r\nvision that had once been vivid to you when you were a boy, and steeped\r\nyour spirit in tales of the East.  The barbaric gorgeousnesses, for\r\ninstance; and the princely titles, the sumptuous titles, the sounding\r\ntitles,--how good they taste in the mouth!  The Nizam of Hyderabad; the\r\nMaharajah of Travancore; the Nabob of Jubbelpore; the Begum of Bhopal;\r\nthe Nawab of Mysore; the Ranee of Gulnare; the Ahkoond of Swat's; the Rao\r\nof Rohilkund; the Gaikwar of Baroda.  Indeed, it is a country that runs\r\nrichly to name.  The great god Vishnu has 108--108 special ones--108\r\npeculiarly holy ones--names just for Sunday use only.  I learned the\r\nwhole of Vishnu's 108 by heart once, but they wouldn't stay; I don't\r\nremember any of them now but John W.\r\n\r\nAnd the romances connected with those princely native houses--to this\r\nday they are always turning up, just as in the old, old times.  They were\r\nsweating out a romance in an English court in Bombay a while before we\r\nwere there.  In this case a native prince, 16 1/2 years old, who has been\r\nenjoying his titles and dignities and estates unmolested for fourteen\r\nyears, is suddenly haled into court on the charge that he is rightfully\r\nno prince at all, but a pauper peasant; that the real prince died when\r\ntwo and one-half years old; that the death was concealed, and a peasant\r\nchild smuggled into the royal cradle, and that this present incumbent was\r\nthat smuggled substitute.  This is the very material that so many\r\noriental tales have been made of.\r\n\r\nThe case of that great prince, the Gaikwar of Baroda, is a reversal of\r\nthe theme.  When that throne fell vacant, no heir could be found for some\r\ntime, but at last one was found in the person of a peasant child who was\r\nmaking mud pies in a village street, and having an innocent good time.\r\nBut his pedigree was straight; he was the true prince, and he has reigned\r\never since, with none to dispute his right.\r\n\r\nLately there was another hunt for an heir to another princely house, and\r\none was found who was circumstanced about as the Gaikwar had been.  His\r\nfathers were traced back, in humble life, along a branch of the ancestral\r\ntree to the point where it joined the stem fourteen generations ago, and\r\nhis heirship was thereby squarely established.  The tracing was done by\r\nmeans of the records of one of the great Hindoo shrines, where princes on\r\npilgrimage record their names and the date of their visit.  This is to\r\nkeep the prince's religious account straight, and his spiritual person\r\nsafe; but the record has the added value of keeping the pedigree\r\nauthentic, too.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of Bombay now, at this distance of time, I seem to have a\r\nkaleidoscope at my eye; and I hear the clash of the glass bits as the\r\nsplendid figures change, and fall apart, and flash into new forms, figure\r\nafter figure, and with the birth of each new form I feel my skin crinkle\r\nand my nerve-web tingle with a new thrill of wonder and delight.  These\r\nremembered pictures float past me in a sequence of contracts; following\r\nthe same order always, and always whirling by and disappearing with the\r\nswiftness of a dream, leaving me with the sense that the actuality was\r\nthe experience of an hour, at most, whereas it really covered days, I\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nThe series begins with the hiring of a \xe2\x80\x9cbearer\xe2\x80\x9d--native man-servant--a\r\nperson who should be selected with some care, because as long as he is in\r\nyour employ he will be about as near to you as your clothes.\r\n\r\nIn India your day may be said to begin with the \xe2\x80\x9cbearer's\xe2\x80\x9d knock on the\r\nbedroom door, accompanied by a formula of words--a formula which is\r\nintended to mean that the bath is ready.  It doesn't really seem to mean\r\nanything at all.  But that is because you are not used to \xe2\x80\x9cbearer\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n English.  You will presently understand.\r\n\r\nWhere he gets his English is his own secret.  There is nothing like it\r\nelsewhere in the earth; or even in paradise, perhaps, but the other place\r\nis probably full of it.  You hire him as soon as you touch Indian soil;\r\nfor no matter what your sex is, you cannot do without him.  He is\r\nmessenger, valet, chambermaid, table-waiter, lady's maid, courier--he is\r\neverything.  He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt; he sleeps\r\non the stone floor outside your chamber door, and gets his meals you do\r\nnot know where nor when; you only know that he is not fed on the\r\npremises, either when you are in a hotel or when you are a guest in a\r\nprivate house.  His wages are large--from an Indian point of view--and he\r\nfeeds and clothes himself out of them.  We had three of him in two and a\r\nhalf months.  The first one's rate was thirty rupees a month that is to\r\nsay, twenty-seven cents a day; the rate of the others, Rs. 40 (40 rupees)\r\na month.  A princely sum; for the native switchman on a railway and the\r\nnative servant in a private family get only Rs. 7 per month, and the\r\nfarm-hand only 4.  The two former feed and clothe themselves and their\r\nfamilies on their $1.90 per month; but I cannot believe that the farmhand\r\nhas to feed himself on his $1.08.  I think the farm probably feeds him,\r\nand that the whole of his wages, except a trifle for the priest, go to\r\nthe support of his family.  That is, to the feeding of his family; for\r\nthey live in a mud hut, hand-made, and, doubtless, rent-free, and they\r\nwear no clothes; at least, nothing more than a rag.  And not much of a\r\nrag at that, in the case of the males.  However, these are handsome times\r\nfor the farm-hand; he was not always the child of luxury that he is now.\r\nThe Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, in a recent official\r\nutterance wherein he was rebuking a native deputation for complaining of\r\nhard times, reminded them that they could easily remember when a\r\nfarm-hand's wages were only half a rupee (former value) a month--that\r\nis to say, less than a cent a day; nearly $2.90 a year.  If such a\r\nwage-earner had a good deal of a family--and they all have that, for God\r\nis very good to these poor natives in some ways--he would save a profit\r\nof fifteen cents, clean and clear, out of his year's toil; I mean a\r\nfrugal, thrifty person would, not one given to display and ostentation.\r\nAnd if he owed $13.50 and took good care of his health, he could pay it\r\noff in ninety years.  Then he could hold up his head, and look his\r\ncreditors in the face again.\r\n\r\nThink of these facts and what they mean.  India does not consist of\r\ncities.  There are no cities in India--to speak of.  Its stupendous\r\npopulation consists of farm-laborers.  India is one vast farm--one almost\r\ninterminable stretch of fields with mud fences between. . .  Think of the\r\nabove facts; and consider what an incredible aggregate of poverty they\r\nplace before you.\r\n\r\nThe first Bearer that applied, waited below and sent up his\r\nrecommendations.  That was the first morning in Bombay.  We read them\r\nover; carefully, cautiously, thoughtfully.  There was not a fault to find\r\nwith them--except one; they were all from Americans.  Is that a slur?\r\nIf it is, it is a deserved one.  In my experience, an American's\r\nrecommendation of a servant is not usually valuable.  We are too\r\ngood-natured a race; we hate to say the unpleasant thing; we shrink from\r\nspeaking the unkind truth about a poor fellow whose bread depends upon\r\nour verdict; so we speak of his good points only, thus not scrupling to\r\ntell a lie--a silent lie--for in not mentioning his bad ones we as good\r\nas say he hasn't any.  The only difference that I know of between a\r\nsilent lie and a spoken one is, that the silent lie is a less respectable\r\none than the other.  And it can deceive, whereas the other can't--as a\r\nrule.  We not only tell the silent lie as to a servant's faults, but we\r\nsin in another way: we overpraise his merits; for when it comes to\r\nwriting recommendations of servants we are a nation of gushers.  And we\r\nhave not the Frenchman's excuse.  In France you must give the departing\r\nservant a good recommendation; and you must conceal his faults; you have\r\nno choice.  If you mention his faults for the protection of the next\r\ncandidate for his services, he can sue you for damages; and the court\r\nwill award them, too; and, moreover, the judge will give you a sharp\r\ndressing-down from the bench for trying to destroy a poor man's\r\ncharacter, and rob him of his bread.  I do not state this on my own\r\nauthority, I got it from a French physician of fame and repute--a man who\r\nwas born in Paris, and had practiced there all his life.  And he said\r\nthat he spoke not merely from common knowledge, but from exasperating\r\npersonal experience.\r\n\r\nAs I was saying, the Bearer's recommendations were all from American\r\ntourists; and St. Peter would have admitted him to the fields of the\r\nblest on them--I mean if he is as unfamiliar with our people and our ways\r\nas I suppose he is.  According to these recommendations, Manuel X. was\r\nsupreme in all the arts connected with his complex trade; and these\r\nmanifold arts were mentioned--and praised-in detail.  His English was\r\nspoken of in terms of warm admiration--admiration verging upon rapture.\r\nI took pleased note of that, and hoped that some of it might be true.\r\n\r\nWe had to have some one right away; so the family went down stairs and\r\ntook him a week on trial; then sent him up to me and departed on their\r\naffairs.  I was shut up in my quarters with a bronchial cough, and glad\r\nto have something fresh to look at, something new to play with.  Manuel\r\nfilled the bill; Manuel was very welcome.  He was toward fifty years old,\r\ntall, slender, with a slight stoop--an artificial stoop, a deferential\r\nstoop, a stoop rigidified by long habit--with face of European mould;\r\nshort hair intensely black; gentle black eyes, timid black eyes, indeed;\r\ncomplexion very dark, nearly black in fact; face smooth-shaven.  He was\r\nbareheaded and barefooted, and was never otherwise while his week with us\r\nlasted; his clothing was European, cheap, flimsy, and showed much wear.\r\n\r\nHe stood before me and inclined his head (and body) in the pathetic\r\nIndian way, touching his forehead with the finger-ends of his right\r\nhand, in salute.  I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cManuel, you are evidently Indian, but you seem to have a Spanish name\r\nwhen you put it all together.  How is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA perplexed look gathered in his face; it was plain that he had not\r\nunderstood--but he didn't let on.  He spoke back placidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName, Manuel.  Yes, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know; but how did you get the name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I suppose.  Think happen so.  Father same name, not mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw that I must simplify my language and spread my words apart, if I\r\nwould be understood by this English scholar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell--then--how--did--your--father--get--his name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he,\xe2\x80\x9d--brightening a little--\xe2\x80\x9che Christian--Portygee; live in Goa; I\r\nborn Goa; mother not Portygee, mother native-high-caste Brahmin--Coolin\r\nBrahmin; highest caste; no other so high caste.  I high-caste Brahmin,\r\ntoo.  Christian, too, same like father; high-caste Christian Brahmin,\r\nmaster--Salvation Army.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this haltingly, and with difficulty.  Then he had an inspiration, and\r\nbegan to pour out a flood of words that I could make nothing of; so I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--don't do that.  I can't understand Hindostani.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot Hindostani, master--English.  Always I speaking English sometimes\r\nwhen I talking every day all the time at you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, stick to that; that is intelligible.  It is not up to my\r\nhopes, it is not up to the promise of the recommendations, still it is\r\nEnglish, and I understand it.  Don't elaborate it; I don't like\r\nelaborations when they are crippled by uncertainty of touch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, never mind; it was only a random thought; I didn't expect you to\r\nunderstand it.  How did you get your English; is it an acquirement, or\r\njust a gift of God?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter some hesitation--piously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he very good.  Christian god very good, Hindoo god very good, too.\r\nTwo million Hindoo god, one Christian god--make two million and one.  All\r\nmine; two million and one god.  I got a plenty.  Sometime I pray all time\r\nat those, keep it up, go all time every day; give something at shrine,\r\nall good for me, make me better man; good for me, good for my family, dam\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he had another inspiration, and went rambling off into fervent\r\nconfusions and incoherencies, and I had to stop him again.  I thought we\r\nhad talked enough, so I told him to go to the bathroom and clean it up\r\nand remove the slops--this to get rid of him.  He went away, seeming to\r\nunderstand, and got out some of my clothes and began to brush them.  I\r\nrepeated my desire several times, simplifying and re-simplifying it, and\r\nat last he got the idea.  Then he went away and put a coolie at the work,\r\nand explained that he would lose caste if he did it himself; it would be\r\npollution, by the law of his caste, and it would cost him a deal of fuss\r\nand trouble to purify himself and accomplish his rehabilitation.  He said\r\nthat that kind of work was strictly forbidden to persons of caste, and as\r\nstrictly restricted to the very bottom layer of Hindoo society--the\r\ndespised 'Sudra' (the toiler, the laborer).  He was right; and apparently\r\nthe poor Sudra has been content with his strange lot, his insulting\r\ndistinction, for ages and ages--clear back to the beginning of things, so\r\nto speak.  Buckle says that his name--laborer--is a term of contempt;\r\nthat it is ordained by the Institutes of Menu (900 B.C.) that if a Sudra\r\nsit on a level with his superior he shall be exiled or branded--[Without\r\ngoing into particulars I will remark that as a rule they wear no clothing\r\nthat would conceal the brand.--M. T.] .  .  .  if he speak\r\ncontemptuously of his superior or insult him he shall suffer death; if he\r\nlisten to the reading of the sacred books he shall have burning oil\r\npoured in his ears; if he memorize passages from them he shall be killed;\r\nif he marry his daughter to a Brahmin the husband shall go to hell for\r\ndefiling himself by contact with a woman so infinitely his inferior; and\r\nthat it is forbidden to a Sudra to acquire wealth.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe bulk of the\r\npopulation of India,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bucklet--[Population to-day, 300,000,000.]\r\n--\xe2\x80\x9cis the Sudras--the workers, the farmers, the creators of wealth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nManuel was a failure, poor old fellow.  His age was against him.  He was\r\ndesperately slow and phenomenally forgetful.  When he went three blocks\r\non an errand he would be gone two hours, and then forget what it was he\r\nwent for.  When he packed a trunk it took him forever, and the trunk's\r\ncontents were an unimaginable chaos when he got done.  He couldn't wait\r\nsatisfactorily at table--a prime defect, for if you haven't your own\r\nservant in an Indian hotel you are likely to have a slow time of it and\r\ngo away hungry.  We couldn't understand his English; he couldn't\r\nunderstand ours; and when we found that he couldn't understand his own,\r\nit seemed time for us to part.  I had to discharge him; there was no help\r\nfor it.  But I did it as kindly as I could, and as gently.  We must part,\r\nsaid I, but I hoped we should meet again in a better world.  It was not\r\ntrue, but it was only a little thing to say, and saved his feelings and\r\ncost me nothing.\r\n\r\nBut now that he was gone, and was off my mind and heart, my spirits began\r\nto rise at once, and I was soon feeling brisk and ready to go out and\r\nhave adventures.  Then his newly-hired successor flitted in, touched his\r\nforehead, and began to fly around here, there, and everywhere, on his\r\nvelvet feet, and in five minutes he had everything in the room\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cship-shape and Bristol fashion,\xe2\x80\x9d as the sailors say, and was standing at\r\nthe salute, waiting for orders.  Dear me, what a rustler he was after the\r\nslumbrous way of Manuel, poor old slug!  All my heart, all my affection,\r\nall my admiration, went out spontaneously to this frisky little forked\r\nblack thing, this compact and compressed incarnation of energy and force\r\nand promptness and celerity and confidence, this smart, smily, engaging,\r\nshiney-eyed little devil, feruled on his upper end by a gleaming\r\nfire-coal of a fez with a red-hot tassel dangling from it.  I said,\r\nwith deep satisfaction--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou'll suit.  What is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe reeled it mellowly off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me see if I can make a selection out of it--for business uses, I\r\nmean; we will keep the rest for Sundays.  Give it to me in installments.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did it.  But there did not seem to be any short ones, except\r\nMousa--which suggested mouse.  It was out of character; it was too soft,\r\ntoo quiet, too conservative; it didn't fit his splendid style.  I\r\nconsidered, and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMousa is short enough, but I don't quite like it.  It seems colorless\r\n--inharmonious--inadequate; and I am sensitive to such things.  How do\r\nyou\r\nthink Satan would do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, master.  Satan do wair good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was his way of saying \xe2\x80\x9cvery good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a rap at the door.  Satan covered the ground with a single\r\nskip; there was a word or two of Hindostani, then he disappeared.  Three\r\nminutes later he was before me again, militarily erect, and waiting for\r\nme to speak first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, Satan?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod want to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod.  I show him up, master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, this is so unusual, that--that--well, you see indeed I am so\r\nunprepared--I don't quite know what I do mean.  Dear me, can't you\r\nexplain?  Don't you see that this is a most ex----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere his card, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWasn't it curious--and amazing, and tremendous, and all that?  Such a\r\npersonage going around calling on such as I, and sending up his card,\r\nlike a mortal--sending it up by Satan.  It was a bewildering collision of\r\nthe impossibles.  But this was the land of the Arabian Nights, this was\r\nIndia! and what is it that cannot happen in India?\r\n\r\nWe had the interview.  Satan was right--the Visitor was indeed a God in\r\nthe conviction of his multitudinous followers, and was worshiped by them\r\nin sincerity and humble adoration.  They are troubled by no doubts as to\r\nhis divine origin and office.  They believe in him, they pray to him,\r\nthey make offerings to him, they beg of him remission of sins; to them\r\nhis person, together with everything connected with it, is sacred; from\r\nhis barber they buy the parings of his nails and set them in gold, and\r\nwear them as precious amulets.\r\n\r\nI tried to seem tranquilly conversational and at rest, but I was not.\r\nWould you have been?  I was in a suppressed frenzy of excitement and\r\ncuriosity and glad wonder.  I could not keep my eyes off him.  I was\r\nlooking upon a god, an actual god, a recognized and accepted god; and\r\nevery detail of his person and his dress had a consuming interest for me.\r\nAnd the thought went floating through my head, \xe2\x80\x9cHe is worshiped--think of\r\nit--he is not a recipient of the pale homage called compliment, wherewith\r\nthe highest human clay must make shift to be satisfied, but of an\r\ninfinitely richer spiritual food: adoration, worship!--men and women lay\r\ntheir cares and their griefs and their broken hearts at his feet; and he\r\ngives them his peace; and they go away healed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd just then the Awful Visitor said, in the simplest way--\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a\r\nfeature of the philosophy of Huck Finn which\xe2\x80\x9d--and went luminously on\r\nwith the construction of a compact and nicely-discriminated literary\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nIt is a land of surprises--India!  I had had my ambitions--I had hoped,\r\nand almost expected, to be read by kings and presidents and emperors--but\r\nI had never looked so high as That.  It would be false modesty to pretend\r\nthat I was not inordinately pleased.  I was.  I was much more pleased\r\nthan I should have been with a compliment from a man.\r\n\r\nHe remained half an hour, and I found him a most courteous and charming\r\ngentleman.  The godship has been in his family a good while, but I do not\r\nknow how long.  He is a Mohammedan deity; by earthly rank he is a prince;\r\nnot an Indian but a Persian prince.  He is a direct descendant of the\r\nProphet's line.  He is comely; also young--for a god; not forty, perhaps\r\nnot above thirty-five years old.  He wears his immense honors with\r\ntranquil grace, and with a dignity proper to his awful calling.  He\r\nspeaks English with the ease and purity of a person born to it.  I think\r\nI am not overstating this.  He was the only god I had ever seen, and I\r\nwas very favorably impressed.  When he rose to say good-bye, the door\r\nswung open and I caught the flash of a red fez, and heard these words,\r\nreverently said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSatan see God out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d And these mis-mated Beings passed from view Satan in the lead and\r\nThe Other following after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nFew of us can stand prosperity.  Another man's, I mean.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe next picture in my mind is Government House, on Malabar Point, with\r\nthe wide sea-view from the windows and broad balconies; abode of His\r\nExcellency the Governor of the Bombay Presidency--a residence which is\r\nEuropean in everything but the native guards and servants, and is a home\r\nand a palace of state harmoniously combined.\r\n\r\nThat was England, the English power, the English civilization, the modern\r\ncivilization--with the quiet elegancies and quiet colors and quiet tastes\r\nand quiet dignity that are the outcome of the modern cultivation.  And\r\nfollowing it came a picture of the ancient civilization of India--an hour\r\nin the mansion of a native prince: Kumar Schri Samatsinhji Bahadur of the\r\nPalitana State.\r\n\r\nThe young lad, his heir, was with the prince; also, the lad's sister, a\r\nwee brown sprite, very pretty, very serious, very winning, delicately\r\nmoulded, costumed like the daintiest butterfly, a dear little fairyland\r\nprincess, gravely willing to be friendly with the strangers, but in the\r\nbeginning preferring to hold her father's hand until she could take stock\r\nof them and determine how far they were to be trusted.  She must have\r\nbeen eight years old; so in the natural (Indian) order of things she\r\nwould be a bride in three or four years from now, and then this free\r\ncontact with the sun and the air and the other belongings of out-door\r\nnature and comradeship with visiting male folk would end, and she would\r\nshut herself up in the zenana for life, like her mother, and by inherited\r\nhabit of mind would be happy in that seclusion and not look upon it as an\r\nirksome restraint and a weary captivity.\r\n\r\nThe game which the prince amuses his leisure with--however, never mind\r\nit, I should never be able to describe it intelligibly.  I tried to get\r\nan idea of it while my wife and daughter visited the princess in the\r\nzenana, a lady of charming graces and a fluent speaker of English, but I\r\ndid not make it out.  It is a complicated game, and I believe it is said\r\nthat nobody can learn to play it well--but an Indian.  And I was not able\r\nto learn how to wind a turban.  It seemed a simple art and easy; but that\r\nwas a deception.  It is a piece of thin, delicate stuff a foot wide or\r\nmore, and forty or fifty feet long; and the exhibitor of the art takes\r\none end of it in his two hands, and winds it in and out intricately about\r\nhis\r\nhead,  twisting it as he goes, and in a minute or two the thing is\r\nfinished, and is neat and symmetrical and fits as snugly as a mould.\r\n\r\nWe were interested in the wardrobe and the jewels, and in the silverware,\r\nand its grace of shape and beauty and delicacy of ornamentation.  The\r\nsilverware is kept locked up, except at meal-times, and none but the\r\nchief butler and the prince have keys to the safe.  I did not clearly\r\nunderstand why, but it was not for the protection of the silver.  It was\r\neither to protect the prince from the contamination which his caste would\r\nsuffer if the vessels were touched by low-caste hands, or it was to\r\nprotect his highness from poison.  Possibly it was both.  I believe a\r\nsalaried taster has to taste everything before the prince ventures it--an\r\nancient and judicious custom in the East, and has thinned out the tasters\r\na good deal, for of course it is the cook that puts the poison in.  If I\r\nwere an Indian prince I would not go to the expense of a taster, I would\r\neat with the cook.\r\n\r\nCeremonials are always interesting; and I noted that the Indian\r\ngood-morning is a ceremonial, whereas ours doesn't amount to that.  In\r\nsalutation the son reverently touches the father's forehead with a small\r\nsilver implement tipped with vermillion paste which leaves a red spot\r\nthere, and in return the son receives the father's blessing.  Our good\r\nmorning is well enough for the rowdy West, perhaps, but would be too\r\nbrusque for the soft and ceremonious East.\r\n\r\nAfter being properly necklaced, according to custom, with great garlands\r\nmade of yellow flowers, and provided with betel-nut to chew, this\r\npleasant visit closed, and we passed thence to a scene of a different\r\nsort: from this glow of color and this sunny life to those grim\r\nreceptacles of the Parsee dead, the Towers of Silence.  There is\r\nsomething stately about that name, and an impressiveness which sinks\r\ndeep; the hush of death is in it.  We have the Grave, the Tomb, the\r\nMausoleum, God's Acre, the Cemetery; and association has made them\r\neloquent with solemn meaning; but we have no name that is so majestic as\r\nthat one, or lingers upon the ear with such deep and haunting pathos.\r\n\r\nOn lofty ground, in the midst of a paradise of tropical foliage and\r\nflowers, remote from the world and its turmoil and noise, they stood--the\r\nTowers of Silence; and away below was spread the wide groves of cocoa\r\npalms, then the city, mile on mile, then the ocean with its fleets of\r\ncreeping ships all steeped in a stillness as deep as the hush that\r\nhallowed this high place of the dead.  The vultures were there.  They\r\nstood close together in a great circle all around the rim of a massive\r\nlow tower--waiting; stood as motionless as sculptured ornaments, and\r\nindeed almost deceived one into the belief that that was what they were.\r\nPresently there was a slight stir among the score of persons present, and\r\nall moved reverently out of the path and ceased from talking.  A funeral\r\nprocession entered the great gate, marching two and two, and moved\r\nsilently by, toward the Tower.  The corpse lay in a shallow shell, and\r\nwas under cover of a white cloth, but was otherwise naked.  The bearers\r\nof the body were separated by an interval of thirty feet from the\r\nmourners.  They, and also the mourners, were draped all in pure white,\r\nand each couple of mourners was figuratively bound together by a piece of\r\nwhite rope or a handkerchief--though they merely held the ends of it in\r\ntheir hands.  Behind the procession followed a dog, which was led in a\r\nleash.  When the mourners had reached the neighborhood of the Tower\r\n--neither they nor any other human being but the bearers of the dead must\r\napproach within thirty feet of it--they turned and went back to one of\r\nthe prayer-houses within the gates, to pray for the spirit of their dead.\r\nThe bearers unlocked the Tower's sole door and disappeared from view\r\nwithin.  In a little while they came out bringing the bier and the white\r\ncovering-cloth, and locked the door again.  Then the ring of vultures\r\nrose, flapping their wings, and swooped down into the Tower to devour the\r\nbody.  Nothing was left of it but a clean-picked skeleton when they\r\nflocked-out again a few minutes afterward.\r\n\r\nThe principle which underlies and orders everything connected with a\r\nParsee funeral is Purity.  By the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion, the\r\nelements, Earth, Fire, and Water, are sacred, and must not be\r\ncontaminated by contact with a dead body.  Hence corpses must not be\r\nburned, neither must they be buried.  None may touch the dead or enter\r\nthe Towers where they repose except certain men who are officially\r\nappointed for that purpose.  They receive high pay, but theirs is a\r\ndismal life, for they must live apart from their species, because their\r\ncommerce with the dead defiles them, and any who should associate with\r\nthem would share their defilement.  When they come out of the Tower the\r\nclothes they are wearing are exchanged for others, in a building within\r\nthe grounds, and the ones which they have taken off are left behind, for\r\nthey are contaminated, and must never be used again or suffered to go\r\noutside the grounds.  These bearers come to every funeral in new\r\ngarments.  So far as is known, no human being, other than an official\r\ncorpse-bearer--save one--has ever entered a Tower of Silence after its\r\nconsecration.  Just a hundred years ago a European rushed in behind the\r\nbearers and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbidden\r\nmysteries of the place.  This shabby savage's name is not given; his\r\nquality is also concealed.  These two details, taken in connection with\r\nthe fact that for his extraordinary offense the only punishment he got\r\nfrom the East India Company's Government was a solemn official\r\n\xe2\x80\x9creprimand\xe2\x80\x9d--suggest the suspicion that he was a European of consequence.\r\nThe same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning that\r\nfuture offenders of his sort, if in the Company's service, would be\r\ndismissed; and if merchants, suffer revocation of license and exile to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to their\r\ncircumference, like a gasometer.  If you should fill a gasometer half way\r\nup with solid granite masonry, then drive a wide and deep well down\r\nthrough the center of this mass of masonry, you would have the idea of a\r\nTower of Silence.  On the masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie, in\r\nshallow trenches which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well.  The\r\ntrenches slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall.\r\nUnderground drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this water\r\nfrom the bottom of the well.\r\n\r\nWhen a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain and the flaming\r\nsun a month it is perfectly dry and clean.  Then the same bearers that\r\nbrought it there come gloved and take it up with tongs and throw it into\r\nthe well.  There it turns to dust.  It is never seen again, never touched\r\nagain, in the world.  Other peoples separate their dead, and preserve and\r\ncontinue social distinctions in the grave--the skeletons of kings and\r\nstatesmen and generals in temples and pantheons proper to skeletons of\r\ntheir degree, and the skeletons of the commonplace and the poor in places\r\nsuited to their meaner estate; but the Parsees hold that all men rank\r\nalike in death--all are humble, all poor, all destitute.  In sign of\r\ntheir poverty they are sent to their grave naked, in sign of their\r\nequality the bones of the rich, the poor, the illustrious and the obscure\r\nare flung into the common well together.  At a Parsee funeral there are\r\nno vehicles; all concerned must walk, both rich and poor, howsoever great\r\nthe distance to be traversed may be.  In the wells of the Five Towers of\r\nSilence is mingled the dust of all the Parsee men and women and children\r\nwho have died in Bombay and its vicinity during the two centuries which\r\nhave elapsed since the Mohammedan conquerors drove the Parsees out of\r\nPersia, and into that region of India.  The earliest of the five towers\r\nwas built by the Modi family something more than 200 years ago, and it is\r\nnow reserved to the heirs of that house; none but the dead of that blood\r\nare carried thither.\r\n\r\nThe origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral is not now\r\nknown--the presence of the dog.  Before a corpse is borne from the house\r\nof mourning it must be uncovered and exposed to the gaze of a dog; a dog\r\nmust also be led in the rear of the funeral.  Mr. Nusserwanjee Byramjee,\r\nSecretary to the Parsee Punchayet, said that these formalities had once\r\nhad a meaning and a reason for their institution, but that they were\r\nsurvivals whose origin none could now account for.  Custom and tradition\r\ncontinue them in force, antiquity hallows them.  It is thought that in\r\nancient times in Persia the dog was a sacred animal and could guide souls\r\nto heaven; also that his eye had the power of purifying objects which had\r\nbeen contaminated by the touch of the dead; and that hence his presence\r\nwith the funeral cortege provides an ever-applicable remedy in case of\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nThe Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the dead is an\r\neffective protection of the living; that it disseminates no corruption,\r\nno impurities of any sort, no disease-germs; that no wrap, no garment\r\nwhich has touched the dead is allowed to touch the living afterward; that\r\nfrom the Towers of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to the\r\noutside world.  These are just claims, I think.  As a sanitary measure,\r\ntheir system seems to be about the equivalent of cremation, and as sure.\r\nWe are drifting slowly--but hopefully--toward cremation in these days.\r\nIt could not be expected that this progress should be swift, but if it be\r\nsteady and continuous, even if slow, that will suffice.  When cremation\r\nbecomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it; we should shudder at\r\nburial if we allowed ourselves to think what goes on in the grave.\r\n\r\nThe dog was an impressive figure to me, representing as he did a mystery\r\nwhose key is lost.  He was humble, and apparently depressed; and he let\r\nhis head droop pensively, and looked as if he might be trying to call\r\nback to his mind what it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago when\r\nhe began his function.  There was another impressive thing close at hand,\r\nbut I was not privileged to see it.  That was the sacred fire--a fire\r\nwhich is supposed to have been burning without interruption for more than\r\ntwo centuries; and so, living by the same heat that was imparted to it so\r\nlong ago.\r\n\r\nThe Parsees are a remarkable community.  There are only about 60,000 in\r\nBombay, and only about half as many as that in the rest of India; but\r\nthey make up in importance what they lack in numbers.  They are highly\r\neducated, energetic, enterprising, progressive, rich, and the Jew himself\r\nis not more lavish or catholic in his charities and benevolences.  The\r\nParsees build and endow hospitals, for both men and animals; and they and\r\ntheir womenkind keep an open purse for all great and good objects.  They\r\nare a political force, and a valued support to the government.  They have\r\na pure and lofty religion, and they preserve it in its integrity and\r\norder their lives by it.\r\n\r\nWe took a final sweep of the wonderful view of plain and city and ocean,\r\nand so ended our visit to the garden and the Towers of Silence; and the\r\nlast thing I noticed was another symbol--a voluntary symbol this one; it\r\nwas a vulture standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and slender and\r\nbranchless palm in an open space in the ground; he was perfectly\r\nmotionless, and looked like a piece of sculpture on a pillar.  And he had\r\na mortuary look, too, which was in keeping with the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nThere is an old-time toast which is golden for its beauty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                   --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe next picture that drifts across the field of my memory is one which\r\nis connected with religious things.  We were taken by friends to see a\r\nJain temple.  It was small, and had many flags or streamers flying from\r\npoles standing above its roof; and its little battlements supported a\r\ngreat many small idols or images.  Upstairs, inside, a solitary Jain was\r\npraying or reciting aloud in the middle of the room.  Our presence did\r\nnot interrupt him, nor even incommode him or modify his fervor.  Ten or\r\ntwelve feet in front of him was the idol, a small figure in a sitting\r\nposture.  It had the pinkish look of a wax doll, but lacked the doll's\r\nroundness of limb and approximation to correctness of form and justness\r\nof proportion.  Mr. Gandhi explained every thing to us.  He was delegate\r\nto the Chicago Fair Congress of Religions.  It was lucidly done, in\r\nmasterly English, but in time it faded from me, and now I have nothing\r\nleft of that episode but an impression: a dim idea of a religious belief\r\nclothed in subtle intellectual forms, lofty and clean, barren of fleshly\r\ngrossnesses; and with this another dim impression which connects that\r\nintellectual system somehow with that crude image, that inadequate idol\r\n--how, I do not know. Properly they do not seem to belong together.\r\nApparently the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint or a god\r\nthrough accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired through a\r\nseries of reincarnations and promotions extending over many ages; and was\r\nnow at last a saint and qualified to vicariously receive worship and\r\ntransmit it to heaven's chancellery.  Was that it?\r\n\r\nAnd thence we went to Mr. Premchand Roychand's bungalow, in Lovelane,\r\nByculla, where an Indian prince was to receive a deputation of the Jain\r\ncommunity who desired to congratulate him upon a high honor lately\r\nconferred upon him by his sovereign, Victoria, Empress of India.  She had\r\nmade him a knight of the order of the Star of India.  It would seem that\r\neven the grandest Indian prince is glad to add the modest title \xe2\x80\x9cSir\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nhis ancient native grandeurs, and is willing to do valuable service to\r\nwin it.  He will remit taxes liberally, and will spend money freely upon\r\nthe betterment of the condition of his subjects, if there is a knighthood\r\nto be gotten by it.  And he will also do good work and a deal of it to\r\nget a gun added to the salute allowed him by the British Government.\r\nEvery year the Empress distributes knighthoods and adds guns for public\r\nservices done by native princes.  The salute of a small prince is three\r\nor four guns; princes of greater consequence have salutes that run higher\r\nand higher, gun by gun,--oh, clear away up to eleven; possibly more, but\r\nI did not hear of any above eleven-gun princes.  I was told that when a\r\nfour-gun prince gets a gun added, he is pretty troublesome for a while,\r\ntill the novelty wears off, for he likes the music, and keeps hunting up\r\npretexts to get himself saluted.  It may be that supremely grand folk,\r\nlike the Nyzam of Hyderabad and the Gaikwar of Baroda, have more than\r\neleven guns, but I don't know.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the bungalow, the large hall on the ground floor was\r\nalready about full, and carriages were still flowing into the grounds.\r\nThe company present made a fine show, an exhibition of human fireworks,\r\nso to speak, in the matters of costume and comminglings of brilliant\r\ncolor.  The variety of form noticeable in the display of turbans was\r\nremarkable.  We were told that the explanation of this was, that this\r\nJain delegation was drawn from many parts of India, and that each man\r\nwore the turban that was in vogue in his own region.  This diversity of\r\nturbans made a beautiful effect.\r\n\r\nI could have wished to start a rival exhibition there, of Christian hats\r\nand clothes.  I would have cleared one side of the room of its Indian\r\nsplendors and repacked the space with Christians drawn from America,\r\nEngland, and the Colonies, dressed in the hats and habits of now, and of\r\ntwenty and forty and fifty years ago.  It would have been a hideous\r\nexhibition, a thoroughly devilish spectacle.  Then there would have been\r\nthe added disadvantage of the white complexion.  It is not an unbearably\r\nunpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself, but when it comes into\r\ncompetition with masses of brown and black the fact is betrayed that it\r\nis endurable only because we are used to it.  Nearly all black and brown\r\nskins are beautiful, but a beautiful white skin is rare.  How rare, one\r\nmay learn by walking down a street in Paris, New York, or London on a\r\nweek-day--particularly an unfashionable street--and keeping count of the\r\nsatisfactory complexions encountered in the course of a mile.  Where dark\r\ncomplexions are massed, they make the whites look bleached-out,\r\nunwholesome, and sometimes frankly ghastly.  I could notice this as a\r\nboy, down South in the slavery days before the war.  The splendid black\r\nsatin skin of the South African Zulus of Durban seemed to me to come very\r\nclose to perfection.  I can see those Zulus yet--'ricksha athletes\r\nwaiting in front of the hotel for custom; handsome and intensely black\r\ncreatures, moderately clothed in loose summer stuffs whose snowy\r\nwhiteness made the black all the blacker by contrast.  Keeping that group\r\nin my mind, I can compare those complexions with the white ones which are\r\nstreaming past this London window now:\r\n\r\n     A lady.  Complexion, new parchment.  Another lady.  Complexion, old\r\n     parchment.\r\n\r\n     Another.  Pink and white, very fine.\r\n\r\n     Man.  Grayish skin, with purple areas.\r\n\r\n     Man.  Unwholesome fish-belly skin.\r\n\r\n     Girl.  Sallow face, sprinkled with freckles.\r\n\r\n     Old woman.  Face whitey-gray.\r\n\r\n     Young butcher.  Face a general red flush.\r\n\r\n     Jaundiced man--mustard yellow.\r\n\r\n     Elderly lady.  Colorless skin, with two conspicuous moles.\r\n\r\n     Elderly man--a drinker.  Boiled-cauliflower nose in a flabby face\r\n     veined with purple crinklings.\r\n\r\n     Healthy young gentleman.  Fine fresh complexion.\r\n\r\n     Sick young man.  His face a ghastly white.\r\n\r\nNo end of people whose skins are dull and characterless modifications of\r\nthe tint which we miscall white.  Some of these faces are pimply; some\r\nexhibit other signs of diseased blood; some show scars of a tint out of a\r\nharmony with the surrounding shades of color.  The white man's complexion\r\nmakes no concealments.  It can't.  It seemed to have been designed as a\r\ncatch-all for everything that can damage it.  Ladies have to paint it,\r\nand powder it, and cosmetic it, and diet it with arsenic, and enamel it,\r\nand be always enticing it, and persuading it, and pestering it, and\r\nfussing at it, to make it beautiful; and they do not succeed.  But these\r\nefforts show what they think of the natural complexion, as distributed.\r\nAs distributed it needs these helps.  The complexion which they try to\r\ncounterfeit is one which nature restricts to the few--to the very few.\r\nTo ninety-nine persons she gives a bad complexion, to the hundredth a\r\ngood one.  The hundredth can keep it--how long?  Ten years, perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe advantage is with the Zulu, I think.  He starts with a beautiful\r\ncomplexion, and it will last him through.  And as for the Indian brown\r\n--firm, smooth, blemishless, pleasant and restful to the eye, afraid of\r\nno\r\ncolor, harmonizing with all colors and adding a grace to them all--I\r\nthink there is no sort of chance for the average white complexion against\r\nthat rich and perfect tint.\r\n\r\nTo return to the bungalow.  The most gorgeous costumes present were worn\r\nby some children.  They seemed to blaze, so bright were the colors, and\r\nso brilliant the jewels strung over the rich materials.  These children\r\nwere professional nautch-dancers, and looked like girls, but they were\r\nboys. They got up by ones and twos and fours, and danced and sang to an\r\naccompaniment of weird music.  Their posturings and gesturings were\r\nelaborate and graceful, but their voices were stringently raspy and\r\nunpleasant, and there was a good deal of monotony about the tune.\r\n\r\nBy and by there was a burst of shouts and cheers outside and the prince\r\nwith his train entered in fine dramatic style.  He was a stately man, he\r\nwas ideally costumed, and fairly festooned with ropes of gems; some of\r\nthe ropes were of pearls, some were of uncut great emeralds--emeralds\r\nrenowned in Bombay for their quality and value.  Their size was\r\nmarvelous, and enticing to the eye, those rocks.  A boy--a princeling\r\n--was with the prince, and he also was a radiant exhibition.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies were not tedious.  The prince strode to his throne with\r\nthe port and majesty--and the sternness--of a Julius Caesar coming to\r\nreceive and receipt for a back-country kingdom and have it over and get\r\nout, and no fooling.  There was a throne for the young prince, too, and\r\nthe two sat there, side by side, with their officers grouped at either\r\nhand and most accurately and creditably reproducing the pictures which\r\none sees in the books--pictures which people in the prince's line of\r\nbusiness have been furnishing ever since Solomon received the Queen of\r\nSheba and showed her his things.  The chief of the Jain delegation read\r\nhis paper of congratulations, then pushed it into a beautifully engraved\r\nsilver cylinder, which was delivered with ceremony into the prince's\r\nhands and at once delivered by him without ceremony into the hands of an\r\nofficer.  I will copy the address here.  It is interesting, as showing\r\nwhat an Indian prince's subject may have opportunity to thank him for in\r\nthese days of modern English rule, as contrasted with what his ancestor\r\nwould have given them opportunity to thank him for a century and a half\r\nago--the days of freedom unhampered by English interference.  A century\r\nand a half ago an address of thanks could have been put into small space.\r\nIt would have thanked the prince--\r\n\r\n     1.  For not slaughtering too many of his people upon mere caprice;\r\n\r\n     2.  For not stripping them bare by sudden and arbitrary tax levies,\r\n     and bringing famine upon them;\r\n\r\n     3.  For not upon empty pretext destroying the rich and seizing their\r\n     property;\r\n\r\n     4.  For not killing, blinding, imprisoning, or banishing the\r\n     relatives of the royal house to protect the throne from possible\r\n     plots;\r\n\r\n     5.  For not betraying the subject secretly, for a bribe, into the\r\n     hands of bands of professional Thugs, to be murdered and robbed in\r\n     the prince's back lot.\r\n\r\nThose were rather common princely industries in the old times, but they\r\nand some others of a harsh sort ceased long ago under English rule.\r\nBetter industries have taken their place, as this Address from the Jain\r\ncommunity will show:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cYour Highness,--We the undersigned members of the Jain community of\r\n     Bombay have the pleasure to approach your Highness with the\r\n     expression of our heartfelt congratulations on the recent conference\r\n     on your Highness of the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the\r\n     Star of India.  Ten years ago we had the pleasure and privilege of\r\n     welcoming your Highness to this city under circumstances which have\r\n     made a memorable epoch in the history of your State, for had it not\r\n     been for a generous and reasonable spirit that your Highness\r\n     displayed in the negotiations between the Palitana Durbar and the\r\n     Jain community, the conciliatory spirit that animated our people\r\n     could not have borne fruit.  That was the first step in your\r\n     Highness's administration, and it fitly elicited the praise of the\r\n     Jain community, and of the Bombay Government.  A decade of your\r\n     Highness's administration, combined with the abilities, training,\r\n     and acquirements that your Highness brought to bear upon it, has\r\n     justly earned for your Highness the unique and honourable\r\n     distinction--the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of\r\n     India, which we understand your Highness is the first to enjoy among\r\n     Chiefs of your Highness's rank and standing.  And we assure your\r\n     Highness that for this mark of honour that has been conferred on you\r\n     by Her Most Gracious Majesty, the Queen-Empress, we feel no less\r\n     proud than your Highness.  Establishment of commercial factories,\r\n     schools, hospitals, etc., by your Highness in your State has marked\r\n     your Highness's career during these ten years, and we trust that\r\n     your Highness will be spared to rule over your people with wisdom\r\n     and foresight, and foster the many reforms that your Highness has\r\n     been pleased to introduce in your State.  We again offer your\r\n     Highness our warmest felicitations for the honour that has been\r\n     conferred on you.  We beg to remain your Highness's obedient\r\n     servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFactories, schools, hospitals, reforms.  The prince propagates that kind\r\nof things in the modern times, and gets knighthood and guns for it.\r\n\r\nAfter the address the prince responded with snap and brevity; spoke a\r\nmoment with half a dozen guests in English, and with an official or two\r\nin a native tongue; then the garlands were distributed as usual, and the\r\nfunction ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nEach person is born to one possession which outvalues all his others--his\r\nlast breath.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nToward midnight, that night, there was another function.  This was a\r\nHindoo wedding--no, I think it was a betrothal ceremony.  Always before,\r\nwe had driven through streets that were multitudinous and tumultuous with\r\npicturesque native life, but now there was nothing of that.  We seemed to\r\nmove through a city of the dead.  There was hardly a suggestion of life\r\nin those still and vacant streets.  Even the crows were silent.  But\r\neverywhere on the ground lay sleeping natives-hundreds and hundreds.\r\nThey lay stretched at full length and tightly wrapped in blankets, heads\r\nand all.  Their attitude and their rigidity counterfeited death.  The\r\nplague was not in Bombay then, but it is devastating the city now.  The\r\nshops are deserted, now, half of the people have fled, and of the\r\nremainder the smitten perish by shoals every day.  No doubt the city\r\nlooks now in the daytime as it looked then at night.  When we had pierced\r\ndeep into the native quarter and were threading its narrow dim lanes, we\r\nhad to go carefully, for men were stretched asleep all about and there\r\nwas hardly room to drive between them.  And every now and then a swarm of\r\nrats would scamper across past the horses' feet in the vague light--the\r\nforbears of the rats that are carrying the plague from house to house in\r\nBombay now. The shops were but sheds, little booths open to the street;\r\nand the goods had been removed, and on the counters families were\r\nsleeping, usually with an oil lamp present.  Recurrent dead  watches, it\r\nlooked like.\r\n\r\nBut at last we turned a corner and saw a great glare of light ahead.  It\r\nwas the home of the bride, wrapped in a perfect conflagration of\r\nilluminations,--mainly gas-work designs, gotten up specially for the\r\noccasion.  Within was abundance of brilliancy--flames, costumes, colors,\r\ndecorations, mirrors--it was another Aladdin show.\r\n\r\nThe bride was a trim and comely little thing of twelve years, dressed as\r\nwe would dress a boy, though more expensively than we should do it, of\r\ncourse.  She moved about very much at her ease, and stopped and talked\r\nwith the guests and allowed her wedding jewelry to be examined.  It was\r\nvery fine.  Particularly a rope of great diamonds, a lovely thing to look\r\nat and handle.  It had a great emerald hanging to it.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom was not present.  He was having betrothal festivities of\r\nhis own at his father's house.  As I understood it, he and the bride were\r\nto entertain company every night and nearly all night for a week or more,\r\nthen get married, if alive.  Both of the children were a little elderly,\r\nas brides and grooms go, in India--twelve; they ought to have been\r\nmarried a year or two sooner; still to a stranger twelve seems quite\r\nyoung enough.\r\n\r\nA while after midnight a couple of celebrated and high-priced\r\nnautch-girls appeared in the gorgeous place, and danced and sang.  With\r\nthem were men who played upon strange instruments which made uncanny\r\nnoises of a sort to make one's flesh creep.  One of these instruments was\r\na pipe, and to its music the girls went through a performance which\r\nrepresented snake charming.  It seemed a doubtful sort of music to charm\r\nanything with, but a native gentleman assured me that snakes like it and\r\nwill come out of their holes and listen to it with every evidence of\r\nrefreshment and gratitude.  He said that at an entertainment in his\r\ngrounds once, the pipe brought out half a dozen snakes, and the music had\r\nto be stopped before they would be persuaded to go.  Nobody wanted their\r\ncompany, for they were bold, familiar, and dangerous; but no one would\r\nkill them, of course, for it is sinful for a Hindoo to kill any kind of a\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nWe withdrew from the festivities at two in the morning.  Another picture,\r\nthen--but it has lodged itself in my memory rather as a stage-scene than\r\nas a reality.  It is of a porch and short flight of steps crowded with\r\ndark faces and ghostly-white draperies flooded with the strong glare from\r\nthe dazzling concentration of illuminations; and midway of the steps one\r\nconspicuous figure for accent--a turbaned giant, with a name according to\r\nhis size: Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale, Vakeel to his Highness\r\nthe Gaikwar of Baroda.  Without him the picture would not have been\r\ncomplete; and if his name had been merely Smith, he wouldn't have\r\nanswered.  Close at hand on house-fronts on both sides of the narrow\r\nstreet were illuminations of a kind commonly employed by the natives\r\n--scores of glass tumblers (containing tapers) fastened a few inches\r\napart all over great latticed frames, forming starry constellations which\r\nshowed out vividly against their black backgrounds.  As we  drew away\r\ninto the distance down the dim lanes the illuminations gathered together\r\ninto a single mass, and glowed out of the enveloping darkness like a sun.\r\n\r\nThen again the deep silence, the skurrying rats, the dim forms stretched\r\neverywhere on the ground; and on either hand those open booths\r\ncounterfeiting sepulchres, with counterfeit corpses sleeping motionless\r\nin the flicker of the counterfeit death lamps.  And now, a year later,\r\nwhen I read the cablegrams I seem to be reading of what I myself partly\r\nsaw--saw before it happened--in a prophetic dream, as it were.  One\r\ncablegram says, \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness in the native town is about suspended.  Except\r\nthe wailing and the tramp of the funerals.  There is but little life or\r\nmovement.  The closed shops exceed in number those that remain open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Another says that 325,000 of the people have fled the city and are\r\ncarrying the plague to the country.  Three days later comes the news,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe population is reduced by half.\xe2\x80\x9d  The refugees have carried the\r\ndisease to Karachi; \xe2\x80\x9c220 cases, 214 deaths.\xe2\x80\x9d  A day or two later, \xe2\x80\x9c52\r\nfresh cases, all of which proved fatal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe plague carries with it a terror which no other disease can excite;\r\nfor of all diseases known to men it is the deadliest--by far the\r\ndeadliest.  \xe2\x80\x9cFifty-two fresh cases--all fatal.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the Black Death\r\nalone that slays like that.  We can all imagine, after a fashion, the\r\ndesolation of a plague-stricken city, and the stupor of stillness broken\r\nat intervals by distant bursts of wailing, marking the passing of\r\nfunerals, here and there and yonder, but I suppose it is not possible for\r\nus to realize to ourselves the nightmare of dread and fear that possesses\r\nthe living who are present in such a place and cannot get away.  That\r\nhalf million fled from Bombay in a wild panic suggests to us something of\r\nwhat they were feeling, but perhaps not even they could realize what the\r\nhalf million were feeling whom they left stranded behind to face the\r\nstalking horror without chance of escape.  Kinglake was in Cairo many\r\nyears ago during an epidemic of the Black Death, and he has imagined the\r\nterrors that creep into a man's heart at such a time and follow him until\r\nthey themselves breed the fatal sign in the armpit, and then the delirium\r\nwith confused images, and home-dreams, and reeling billiard-tables, and\r\nthen the sudden blank of death:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cTo the contagionist, filled as he is with the dread of final\r\n     causes, having no faith in destiny, nor in the fixed will of God,\r\n     and with none of the devil-may-care indifference which might stand\r\n     him instead of creeds--to such one, every rag that shivers in the\r\n     breeze of a plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity.  If by\r\n     any terrible ordinance he be forced to venture forth, he sees death\r\n     dangling from every sleeve; and, as he creeps forward, he poises his\r\n     shuddering limbs between the imminent jacket that is stabbing at his\r\n     right elbow and the murderous pelisse that threatens to mow him\r\n     clean down as it sweeps along on his left.  But most of all he\r\n     dreads that which most of all he should love--the touch of a woman's\r\n     dress; for mothers and wives, hurrying forth on kindly errands from\r\n     the bedsides of the dying, go slouching along through the streets\r\n     more willfully and less courteously than the men.  For a while it\r\n     may be that the caution of the poor Levantine may enable him to\r\n     avoid contact, but sooner or later, perhaps, the dreaded chance\r\n     arrives; that bundle of linen, with the dark tearful eyes at the top\r\n     of it, that labors along with the voluptuous clumsiness of Grisi\r\n     --she has touched the poor Levantine with the hem of her sleeve!\r\nFrom\r\n     that dread moment his peace is gone; his mind for ever hanging upon\r\n     the fatal touch invites the blow which he fears; he watches for the\r\n     symptoms of plague so carefully, that sooner or later they come in\r\n     truth.  The parched mouth is a sign--his mouth is parched; the\r\n     throbbing brain--his brain does throb; the rapid pulse--he touches\r\n     his own wrist (for he dares not ask counsel of any man lest he be\r\n     deserted), he touches his wrist, and feels how his frighted blood\r\n     goes galloping out of his heart.  There is nothing but the fatal\r\n     swelling that is wanting to make his sad conviction complete;\r\n     immediately, he has an odd feel under the arm--no pain, but a little\r\n     straining of the skin; he would to God it were his fancy that were\r\n     strong enough to give him that sensation; this is the worst of all.\r\n     It now seems to him that he could be happy and contented with his\r\n     parched mouth, and his throbbing brain, and his rapid pulse, if only\r\n     he could know that there were no swelling under the left arm; but\r\n     dares he try?--in a moment of calmness and deliberation he dares\r\n     not; but when for a while he has writhed under the torture of\r\n     suspense, a sudden strength of will drives him to seek and know his\r\n     fate; he touches the gland, and finds the skin sane and sound but\r\n     under the cuticle there lies a small lump like a pistol-bullet, that\r\n     moves as he pushes it.  Oh! but is this for all certainty, is this\r\n     the sentence of death?  Feel the gland of the other arm.  There is\r\n     not the same lump exactly, yet something a little like it.  Have not\r\n     some people glands naturally enlarged?--would to heaven he were one!\r\n     So he does for himself the work of the plague, and when the Angel of\r\n     Death thus courted does indeed and in truth come, he has only to\r\n     finish that which has been so well begun; he passes his fiery hand\r\n     over the brain of the victim, and lets him rave for a season, but\r\n     all chance-wise, of people and things once dear, or of people and\r\n     things indifferent.  Once more the poor fellow is back at his home\r\n     in fair Provence, and sees the sundial that stood in his childhood's\r\n     garden--sees his mother, and the long-since forgotten face of that\r\n     little dear sister--(he sees her, he says, on a Sunday morning, for\r\n     all the church bells are ringing); he looks up and down through the\r\n     universe, and owns it well piled with bales upon bales of cotton,\r\n     and cotton eternal--so much so that he feels--he knows--he swears he\r\n     could make that winning hazard, if the billiard-table would not\r\n     slant upwards, and if the cue were a cue worth playing with; but it\r\n     is not--it's a cue that won't move--his own arm won't move--in\r\n     short, there's the devil to pay in the brain of the poor Levantine;\r\n     and perhaps, the next night but one he becomes the 'life and the\r\n     soul' of some squalling jackal family, who fish him out by the foot\r\n     from his shallow and sandy grave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nHunger is the handmaid of genius\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOne day during our stay in Bombay there was a criminal trial of a most\r\ninteresting sort, a terribly realistic chapter out of the \xe2\x80\x9cArabian\r\nNights,\xe2\x80\x9d a strange mixture of simplicities and pieties and murderous\r\npracticalities, which brought back the forgotten days of Thuggee and made\r\nthem live again; in fact, even made them believable.  It was a case where\r\na young girl had been assassinated for the sake of her trifling\r\nornaments, things not worth a laborer's day's wages in America.  This\r\nthing could have been done in many other countries, but hardly with the\r\ncold business-like depravity, absence of fear, absence of caution,\r\ndestitution of the sense of horror, repentance, remorse, exhibited in\r\nthis case.  Elsewhere the murderer would have done his crime secretly, by\r\nnight, and without witnesses; his fears would have allowed him no peace\r\nwhile the dead body was in his neighborhood; he would not have rested\r\nuntil he had gotten it safe out of the way and hidden as effectually as\r\nhe could hide it.  But this Indian murderer does his deed in the full\r\nlight of day, cares nothing for the society of witnesses, is in no way\r\nincommoded by the presence of the corpse, takes his own time about\r\ndisposing of it, and the whole party are so indifferent, so phlegmatic,\r\nthat they take their regular sleep as if nothing was happening and no\r\nhalters hanging over them; and these five bland people close the episode\r\nwith a religious service. The thing reads like a Meadows-Taylor Thug-tale\r\nof half a century ago, as may be seen by the official report of the\r\ntrial:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt the Mazagon Police Court yesterday, Superintendent Nolan again\r\n     charged Tookaram Suntoo Savat Baya, woman, her daughter Krishni, and\r\n     Gopal Vithoo Bhanayker, before Mr. Phiroze Hoshang Dastur, Fourth\r\n     Presidency Magistrate, under sections 302 and 109 of the Code, with\r\n     having on the night of the 30th of December last murdered a Hindoo\r\n     girl named Cassi, aged 12, by strangulation, in the room of a chawl\r\n     at Jakaria Bunder, on the Sewriroad, and also with aiding and\r\n     abetting each other in the commission of the offense.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMr. F. A. Little, Public Prosecutor, conducted the case on behalf\r\n     of the Crown, the accused being undefended.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Little applied under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure\r\n     Code to tender pardon to one of the accused, Krishni, woman, aged\r\n     22, on her undertaking to make a true and full statement of facts\r\n     under which the deceased girl Cassi was murdered.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe Magistrate having granted the Public Prosecutor's application,\r\n     the accused Krishni went into the witness-box, and, on being\r\n     examined by Mr. Little, made the following confession:--I am a\r\n     mill-hand employed at the Jubilee Mill.  I recollect the day\r\n     (Tuesday); on which the body of the deceased Cassi was found.\r\n     Previous to that I attended the mill for half a day, and then\r\n     returned home at 3 in the afternoon, when I saw five persons in the\r\n     house, viz.: the first accused Tookaram, who is my paramour, my\r\n     mother, the second accused Baya, the accused Gopal, and two guests\r\n     named Ramji Daji and Annaji Gungaram.  Tookaram rented the room of\r\n     the chawl situated at Jakaria Bunder-road from its owner,\r\n     Girdharilal Radhakishan, and in that room I, my paramour, Tookaram,\r\n     and his younger brother, Yesso Mahadhoo, live.  Since his arrival in\r\n     Bombay from his native country Yesso came and lived with us.  When I\r\n     returned from the mill on the afternoon of that day, I saw the two\r\n     guests seated on a cot in the veranda, and a few minutes after the\r\n     accused Gopal came and took his seat by their side, while I and my\r\n     mother were seated inside the room.  Tookaram, who had gone out to\r\n     fetch some 'pan' and betelnuts, on his return home had brought the\r\n     two guests with him.  After returning home he gave them 'pan\r\n     supari'.  While they were eating it my mother came out of the room\r\n     and inquired of one of the guests, Ramji, what had happened to his\r\n     foot, when he replied that he had tried many remedies, but they had\r\n     done him no good.  My mother then took some rice in her hand and\r\n     prophesied that the disease which Ramji was suffering from would not\r\n     be cured until he returned to his native country.  In the meantime\r\n     the deceased Casi came from the direction of an out-house, and stood\r\n     in front on the threshold of our room with a 'lota' in her hand.\r\n     Tookaram then told his two guests to leave the room, and they then\r\n     went up the steps towards the quarry.  After the guests had gone\r\n     away, Tookaram seized the deceased, who had come into the room, and\r\n     he afterwards put a waistband around her, and tied her to a post\r\n     which supports a loft. After doing this, he pressed the girl's\r\n     throat, and, having tied her mouth with the 'dhotur' (now shown in\r\n     Court), fastened it to the post.  Having killed the girl, Tookaram\r\n     removed her gold head ornament and a gold 'putlee', and also took\r\n     charge of her 'lota'. Besides these two ornaments Cassi had on her\r\n     person ear-studs, a nose-ring, some silver toe-rings, two necklaces,\r\n     a pair of silver anklets and bracelets.  Tookaram afterwards tried\r\n     to remove the silver amulets, the ear-studs, and the nose-ring; but\r\n     he failed in his attempt.  While he was doing so, I, my mother, and\r\n     Gopal were present.  After removing the two gold ornaments, he\r\n     handed them over to Gopal, who was at the time standing near me.\r\n     When he killed Cassi, Tookaram threatened to strangle me also if I\r\n     informed any one of this.  Gopal and myself were then standing at\r\n     the door of our room, and we both were threatened by Tookaram.  My\r\n     mother, Baya, had seized the legs of the deceased at the time she\r\n     was killed, and whilst she was being tied to the post.  Cassi then\r\n     made a noise. Tookaram and my mother took part in killing the girl.\r\n     After the murder her body was wrapped up in a mattress and kept on\r\n     the loft over the door of our room.  When Cassi was strangled, the\r\n     door of the room was fastened from the inside by Tookaram.  This\r\n     deed was committed shortly after my return home from work in the\r\n     mill. Tookaram put the body of the deceased in the mattress, and,\r\n     after it was left on the loft, he went to have his head shaved by a\r\n     barber named Sambhoo Raghoo, who lives only one door away from me.\r\n     My mother and myself then remained in the possession of the\r\n     information.  I was slapped and threatened by my paramour, Tookaram,\r\n     and that was the only reason why I did not inform any one at that\r\n     time.  When I told Tookaram that I would give information of the\r\n     occurrence, he slapped me.  The accused Gopal was asked by Tookaram\r\n     to go back to his room, and he did so, taking away with him the two\r\n     gold ornaments and the 'lota'.  Yesso Mahadhoo, a brother-in-law of\r\n     Tookaram, came to the house and asked Tookaram why he was washing,\r\n     the water-pipe being just opposite.  Tookaram replied that he was\r\n     washing his dhotur, as a fowl had polluted it.  About 6 o'clock of\r\n     the evening of that day my mother gave me three pice and asked me to\r\n     buy a cocoanut, and I gave the money to Yessoo, who went and fetched\r\n     a cocoanut and some betel leaves.  When Yessoo and others were in\r\n     the room I was bathing, and, after I finished my bath, my mother\r\n     took the cocoanut and the betel leaves from Yessoo, and we five went\r\n     to the sea.  The party consisted of Tookaram, my mother, Yessoo,\r\n     Tookaram's younger brother, and myself.  On reaching the seashore,\r\n     my mother made the offering to the sea, and prayed to be pardoned\r\n     for what we had done.  Before we went to the sea, some one came to\r\n     inquire after the girl Cassi.  The police and other people came to\r\n     make these inquiries both before and after we left the house for the\r\n     seashore.  The police questioned my mother about the girl, and she\r\n     replied that Cassi had come to her door, but had left.  The next day\r\n     the police questioned Tookaram, and he, too, gave a similar reply.\r\n     This was said the same night when the search was made for the girl.\r\n     After the offering was made to the sea, we partook of the cocoanut\r\n     and returned home, when my mother gave me some food; but Tookaram\r\n     did not partake of any food that night.  After dinner I and my\r\n     mother slept inside the room, and Tookaram slept on a cot near his\r\n     brother-in-law, Yessoo Mahadhoo, just outside the door.  That was\r\n     not the usual place where Tookaram slept.  He usually slept inside\r\n     the room.  The body of the deceased remained on the loft when I went\r\n     to sleep.  The room in which we slept was locked, and I heard that\r\n     my paramour, Tookaram, was restless outside.  About 3 o'clock the\r\n     following morning Tookaram knocked at the door, when both myself and\r\n     my mother opened it.  He then told me to go to the steps leading to\r\n     the quarry, and see if any one was about.  Those steps lead to a\r\n     stable, through which we go to the quarry at the back of the\r\n     compound.  When I got to the steps I saw no one there.  Tookaram\r\n     asked me if any one was there, and I replied that I could see no one\r\n     about.  He then took the body of the deceased from the loft, and\r\n     having wrapped it up in his saree, asked me to accompany him to the\r\n     steps of the quarry, and I did so.  The 'saree' now produced here\r\n     was the same.  Besides the 'saree', there was also a 'cholee' on the\r\n     body.  He then carried the body in his arms, and went up the steps,\r\n     through the stable, and then to the right hand towards a Sahib's\r\n     bungalow, where Tookaram placed the body near a wall.  All the time\r\n     I and my mother were with him.  When the body was taken down, Yessoo\r\n     was lying on the cot.  After depositing the body under the wall, we\r\n     all returned home, and soon after 5 a.m.  the police again came and\r\n     took Tookaram away.  About an hour after they returned and took me\r\n     and my mother away.  We were questioned about it, when I made a\r\n     statement.  Two hours later I was taken to the room, and I pointed\r\n     out this waistband, the 'dhotur', the mattress, and the wooden post\r\n     to Superintendent Nolan and Inspectors Roberts and Rashanali, in the\r\n     presence of my mother and Tookaram.  Tookaram killed the girl Cassi\r\n     for her ornaments, which he wanted for the girl to whom he was\r\n     shortly going to be married.  The body was found in the same place\r\n     where it was deposited by Tookaram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe criminal side of the native has always been picturesque, always\r\nreadable.  The Thuggee and one or two other particularly outrageous\r\nfeatures of it have been suppressed by the English, but there is enough\r\nof it left to keep it darkly interesting.  One finds evidence of these\r\nsurvivals in the newspapers.  Macaulay has a light-throwing passage upon\r\nthis matter in his great historical sketch of Warren Hastings, where he\r\nis describing some effects which followed the temporary paralysis of\r\nHastings' powerful government brought about by Sir Philip Francis and his\r\nparty:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe natives considered Hastings as a fallen man; and they acted\r\n     after their kind.  Some of our readers may have seen, in India, a\r\n     cloud of crows pecking a sick vulture to death--no bad type of what\r\n     happens in that country as often as fortune deserts one who has been\r\n     great and dreaded.  In an instant all the sycophants, who had lately\r\n     been ready to lie for him, to forge for him, to pander for him, to\r\n     poison for him, hasten to purchase the favor of his victorious\r\n     enemies by accusing him.  An Indian government has only to let it be\r\n     understood that it wishes a particular man to be ruined, and in\r\n     twenty-four hours it will be furnished with grave charges, supported\r\n     by depositions so full and circumstantial that any person\r\n     unaccustomed to Asiatic mendacity would regard them as decisive.  It\r\n     is well if the signature of the destined victim is not counterfeited\r\n     at the foot of some illegal compact, and if some treasonable paper\r\n     is not slipped into a hiding-place in his house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was nearly a century and a quarter ago.  An article in one of the\r\nchief journals of India (the Pioneer) shows that in some respects the\r\nnative of to-day is just what his ancestor was then.  Here are niceties\r\nof so subtle and delicate a sort that they lift their breed of rascality\r\nto a place among the fine arts, and almost entitle it to respect:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe records of the Indian courts might certainly be relied upon to\r\n     prove that swindlers as a class in the East come very close to, if\r\n     they do not surpass, in brilliancy of execution and originality of\r\n     design the most expert of their fraternity in Europe and America.\r\n     India in especial is the home of forgery.  There are some particular\r\n     districts which are noted as marts for the finest specimens of the\r\n     forger's handiwork.  The business is carried on by firms who possess\r\n     stores of stamped papers to suit every emergency.  They habitually\r\n     lay in a store of fresh stamped papers every year, and some of the\r\n     older and more thriving houses can supply documents for the past\r\n     forty years, bearing the proper water-mark and possessing the\r\n     genuine appearance of age.  Other districts have earned notoriety\r\n     for skilled perjury, a pre-eminence that excites a respectful\r\n     admiration when one thinks of the universal prevalence of the art,\r\n     and persons desirous of succeeding in false suits are ready to pay\r\n     handsomely to avail themselves of the services of these local\r\n     experts as witnesses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVarious instances illustrative of the methods of these swindlers are\r\ngiven.  They exhibit deep cunning and total depravity on the part of the\r\nswindler and his pals, and more obtuseness on the part of the victim than\r\none would expect to find in a country where suspicion of your neighbor\r\nmust surely be one of the earliest things learned.  The favorite subject\r\nis the young fool who has just come into a fortune and is trying to see\r\nhow poor a use he can put it to.  I will quote one example:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes another form of confidence trick is adopted, which is\r\n     invariably successful.  The particular pigeon is spotted, and, his\r\n     acquaintance having been made, he is encouraged in every form of\r\n     vice.  When the friendship is thoroughly established, the swindler\r\n     remarks to the young man that he has a brother who has asked him to\r\n     lend him Rs.10,000.  The swindler says he has the money and would\r\n     lend it; but, as the borrower is his brother, he cannot charge\r\n     interest.  So he proposes that he should hand the dupe the money,\r\n     and the latter should lend it to the swindler's brother, exacting a\r\n     heavy pre-payment of interest which, it is pointed out, they may\r\n     equally enjoy in dissipation.  The dupe sees no objection, and on\r\n     the appointed day receives Rs.7,000 from the swindler, which he\r\n     hands over to the confederate.  The latter is profuse in his thanks,\r\n     and executes a promissory note for Rs.10,000, payable to bearer.\r\n     The swindler allows the scheme to remain quiescent for a time, and\r\n     then suggests that, as the money has not been repaid and as it would\r\n     be unpleasant to sue his brother, it would be better to sell the\r\n     note in the bazaar.  The dupe hands the note over, for the money he\r\n     advanced was not his, and, on being informed that it would be\r\n     necessary to have his signature on the back so as to render the\r\n     security negotiable, he signs without any hesitation.  The swindler\r\n     passes it on to confederates, and the latter employ a respectable\r\n     firm of solicitors to ask the dupe if his signature is genuine.  He\r\n     admits it at once, and his fate is sealed.  A suit is filed by a\r\n     confederate against the dupe, two accomplices being made\r\n     co-defendants.  They admit their Signatures as indorsers, and the\r\n     one swears he bought the note for value from the dupe.  The latter\r\n     has no defense, for no court would believe the apparently idle\r\n     explanation of the manner in which he came to endorse the note.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is only one India!  It is the only country that has a monopoly of\r\ngrand and imposing specialties.  When another country has a remarkable\r\nthing, it cannot have it all to itself--some other country has a\r\nduplicate.  But India--that is different.  Its marvels are its own; the\r\npatents cannot be infringed; imitations are not possible.  And think of\r\nthe size of them, the majesty of them, the weird and outlandish character\r\nof the most of them!\r\n\r\nThere is the Plague, the Black Death: India invented it; India is the\r\ncradle of that mighty birth.\r\n\r\nThe Car of Juggernaut was India's invention.\r\n\r\nSo was the Suttee; and within the time of men still living eight hundred\r\nwidows willingly, and, in fact, rejoicingly, burned themselves to death\r\non the bodies of their dead husbands in a single year.  Eight hundred\r\nwould do it this year if the British government would let them.\r\n\r\nFamine is India's specialty.  Elsewhere famines are inconsequential\r\nincidents--in India they are devastating cataclysms; in one case they\r\nannihilate hundreds; in the other, millions.\r\n\r\nIndia has 2,000,000 gods, and worships them all.  In religion all other\r\ncountries are paupers; India is the only millionaire.\r\n\r\nWith her everything is on a giant scale--even her poverty; no other\r\ncountry can show anything to compare with it.  And she has been used to\r\nwealth on so vast a scale that she has to shorten to single words the\r\nexpressions describing great sums.  She describes 100,000 with one word\r\n--a 'lahk'; she describes ten millions with one word--a 'crore'.\r\n\r\nIn the bowels of the granite mountains she has patiently carved out\r\ndozens of vast temples, and made them glorious with sculptured colonnades\r\nand stately groups of statuary, and has adorned the eternal walls with\r\nnoble paintings.  She has built fortresses of such magnitude that the\r\nshow-strongholds of the rest of the world are but modest little things by\r\ncomparison; palaces that are wonders for rarity of materials, delicacy\r\nand beauty of workmanship, and for cost; and one tomb which men go around\r\nthe globe to see.  It takes eighty nations, speaking eighty languages, to\r\npeople her, and they number three hundred millions.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this she is the mother and home of that wonder of wonders--\r\ncaste--and of that mystery of mysteries, the satanic brotherhood of the\r\nThugs.\r\n\r\nIndia had the start of the whole world in the beginning of things.  She\r\nhad the first civilization; she had the first accumulation of material\r\nwealth; she was populous with deep thinkers and subtle intellects; she\r\nhad mines, and woods, and a fruitful soil.  It would seem as if she\r\nshould have kept the lead, and should be to-day not the meek dependent of\r\nan alien master, but mistress of the world, and delivering law and\r\ncommand to every tribe and nation in it.  But, in truth, there was never\r\nany possibility of such supremacy for her.  If there had been but one\r\nIndia and one language--but there were eighty of them!  Where there are\r\neighty nations and several hundred governments, fighting and quarreling\r\nmust be the common business of life; unity of purpose and policy are\r\nimpossible; out of such elements supremacy in the world cannot come.\r\nEven caste itself could have had the defeating effect of a multiplicity\r\nof tongues, no doubt; for it separates a people into layers, and layers,\r\nand still other layers, that have no community of feeling with each\r\nother; and in such a condition of things as that, patriotism can have no\r\nhealthy growth.\r\n\r\nIt was the division of the country into so many States and nations that\r\nmade Thuggee possible and prosperous.  It is difficult to realize the\r\nsituation.  But perhaps one may approximate it by imagining the States of\r\nour Union peopled by separate nations, speaking separate languages, with\r\nguards and custom-houses strung along all frontiers, plenty of\r\ninterruptions for travelers and traders, interpreters able to handle all\r\nthe languages very rare or non-existent, and a few wars always going on\r\nhere and there and yonder as a further embarrassment to commerce and\r\nexcursioning.  It would make intercommunication in a measure ungeneral.\r\nIndia had eighty languages, and more custom-houses than cats.  No clever\r\nman with the instinct of a highway robber could fail to notice what a\r\nchance for business was here offered.  India was full of clever men with\r\nthe highwayman instinct, and so, quite naturally, the brotherhood of the\r\nThugs came into being to meet the long-felt want.\r\n\r\nHow long ago that was nobody knows--centuries, it is supposed.  One of\r\nthe\r\nchiefest wonders connected with it was the success with which it kept its\r\nsecret.  The English trader did business in India two hundred years and\r\nmore before he ever heard of it; and yet it was assassinating its\r\nthousands all around him every year, the whole time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nThe old saw says, \xe2\x80\x9cLet a sleeping dog lie.\xe2\x80\x9d  Right....  Still, when there\r\nis much at stake it is better to get a newspaper to do it.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nFROM DIARY:\r\n\r\nJanuary 28.   I learned of an official Thug-book the other day.  I was\r\nnot aware before that there was such a thing.  I am allowed the temporary\r\nuse of it.  We are making preparations for travel.  Mainly the\r\npreparations are purchases of bedding.  This is to be used in sleeping\r\nberths in the trains; in private houses sometimes; and in nine-tenths of\r\nthe hotels.  It is not realizable; and yet it is true.  It is a survival;\r\nan apparently unnecessary thing which in some strange way has outlived\r\nthe conditions which once made it necessary.  It comes down from a time\r\nwhen the railway and the hotel did not exist; when the occasional white\r\ntraveler went horseback or by bullock-cart, and stopped over night in the\r\nsmall dak-bungalow provided at easy distances by the government--a\r\nshelter, merely, and nothing more.  He had to carry bedding along, or do\r\nwithout.  The dwellings of the English residents are spacious and\r\ncomfortable and commodiously furnished, and surely it must be an odd\r\nsight to see half a dozen guests come filing into such a place and\r\ndumping blankets and pillows here and there and everywhere.  But custom\r\nmakes incongruous things congruous.\r\n\r\nOne buys the bedding, with waterproof hold-all for it at almost any shop\r\n--there is no difficulty about it.\r\n\r\nJanuary 30.  What a spectacle the railway station was, at train-time!  It\r\nwas a very large station, yet when we arrived it seemed as if the whole\r\nworld was present--half of it inside, the other half outside, and both\r\nhalves, bearing mountainous head-loads of bedding and other freight,\r\ntrying simultaneously to pass each other, in opposing floods, in one\r\nnarrow door.  These opposing floods were patient, gentle, long-suffering\r\nnatives, with whites scattered among them at rare intervals; and wherever\r\na white man's native servant appeared, that native seemed to have put\r\naside his natural gentleness for the time and invested himself with the\r\nwhite man's privilege of making a way for himself by promptly shoving all\r\nintervening black things out of it.  In these exhibitions of authority\r\nSatan was scandalous.  He was probably a Thug in one of his former\r\nincarnations.\r\n\r\nInside the great station, tides upon tides of rainbow-costumed natives\r\nswept along, this way and that, in massed and bewildering confusion,\r\neager, anxious, belated, distressed; and washed up to the long trains and\r\nflowed into them with their packs and bundles, and disappeared, followed\r\nat once by the next wash, the next wave.  And here and there, in the\r\nmidst of this hurly-burly, and seemingly undisturbed by it, sat great\r\ngroups of natives on the bare stone floor,--young, slender brown women,\r\nold, gray wrinkled women, little soft brown babies, old men, young men,\r\nboys; all poor people, but all the females among them, both big and\r\nlittle, bejeweled with cheap and showy nose-rings, toe-rings, leglets,\r\nand armlets, these things constituting all their wealth, no doubt.  These\r\nsilent crowds sat there with their humble bundles and baskets and small\r\nhousehold gear about them, and patiently waited--for what?  A train that\r\nwas to start at some time or other during the day or night!  They hadn't\r\ntimed themselves well, but that was no matter--the thing had been so\r\nordered from on high, therefore why worry?  There was plenty of time,\r\nhours and hours of it, and the thing that was to happen would happen\r\n--there was no hurrying it.\r\n\r\nThe natives traveled third class, and at marvelously cheap rates.  They\r\nwere packed and crammed into cars that held each about fifty; and it was\r\nsaid that often a Brahmin of the highest caste was thus brought into\r\npersonal touch, and consequent defilement, with persons of the lowest\r\ncastes--no doubt a very shocking thing if a body could understand it and\r\nproperly appreciate it.  Yes, a Brahmin who didn't own a rupee and\r\ncouldn't borrow one, might have to touch elbows with a rich hereditary\r\nlord of inferior caste, inheritor of an ancient title a couple of yards\r\nlong, and he would just have to stand it; for if either of the two was\r\nallowed to go in the cars where the sacred white people were, it probably\r\nwouldn't be the august poor Brahmin.  There was an immense string of\r\nthose third-class cars, for the natives travel by hordes; and a weary\r\nhard night of it the occupants would have, no doubt.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached our car, Satan and Barney had already arrived there with\r\ntheir train of porters carrying bedding and parasols and cigar boxes, and\r\nwere at work.  We named him Barney for short; we couldn't use his real\r\nname, there wasn't time.\r\n\r\nIt was a car that promised comfort; indeed, luxury.  Yet the cost of it\r\n--well, economy could no further go; even in France; not even in Italy.\r\nIt\r\nwas built of the plainest and cheapest partially-smoothed boards, with a\r\ncoating of dull paint on them, and there was nowhere a thought of\r\ndecoration.  The floor was bare, but would not long remain so when the\r\ndust should begin to fly.  Across one end of the compartment ran a\r\nnetting for the accommodation of hand-baggage; at the other end was a\r\ndoor which would shut, upon compulsion, but wouldn't stay shut; it opened\r\ninto a narrow little closet which had a wash-bowl in one end of it, and a\r\nplace to put a towel, in case you had one with you--and you would be sure\r\nto have towels, because you buy them with the bedding, knowing that the\r\nrailway doesn't furnish them.  On each side of the car, and running fore\r\nand aft, was a broad leather-covered sofa to sit on in the day and sleep\r\non at night.  Over each sofa hung, by straps, a wide, flat,\r\nleather-covered shelf--to sleep on.  In the daytime you can hitch it up\r\nagainst the wall, out of the way--and then you have a big unencumbered\r\nand most comfortable room to spread out in.  No car in any country is\r\nquite its equal for comfort (and privacy) I think. For usually there are\r\nbut two persons in it; and even when there are four there is but little\r\nsense of impaired privacy.  Our own cars at home can surpass the railway\r\nworld in all details but that one: they have no cosiness; there are too\r\nmany people together.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of each sofa was a side-door, for entrance and exit.\r\nAlong the whole length of the sofa on each side of the car ran a row of\r\nlarge single-plate windows, of a blue tint--blue to soften the bitter\r\nglare of the sun and protect one's eyes from torture.  These could be let\r\ndown out of the way when one wanted the breeze.  In the roof were two oil\r\nlamps which gave a light strong enough to read by; each had a green-cloth\r\nattachment by which it could be covered when the light should be no\r\nlonger needed.\r\n\r\nWhile we talked outside with friends, Barney and Satan placed the\r\nhand-baggage, books, fruits, and soda-bottles in the racks, and the\r\nhold-alls and heavy baggage in the closet, hung the overcoats and\r\nsun-helmets and towels on the hooks, hoisted the two bed-shelves up out\r\nof the way, then shouldered their bedding and retired to the third class.\r\n\r\nNow then, you see what a handsome, spacious, light, airy, homelike place\r\nit was, wherein to walk up and down, or sit and write, or stretch out and\r\nread and smoke.  A central door in the forward end of the compartment\r\nopened into a similar compartment.  It was occupied by my wife and\r\ndaughter.  About nine in the evening, while we halted a while at a\r\nstation, Barney and Satan came and undid the clumsy big hold-alls, and\r\nspread the bedding on the sofas in both compartments--mattresses, sheets,\r\ngay coverlets, pillows, all complete; there are no chambermaids in India\r\n--apparently it was an office that was never heard of.  Then they\r\nclosed the communicating door, nimbly tidied up our place, put the\r\nnight-clothing on the beds and the slippers under them, then returned\r\nto their own quarters.\r\n\r\nJanuary 31.  It was novel and pleasant, and I stayed awake as long as I\r\ncould, to enjoy it, and to read about those strange people the Thugs.  In\r\nmy sleep they remained with me, and tried to strangle me.  The leader of\r\nthe gang was that giant Hindoo who was such a picture in the strong light\r\nwhen we were leaving those Hindoo betrothal festivities at two o'clock in\r\nthe morning--Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale, Vakeel to the\r\nGaikwar of Baroda.  It was he that brought me the invitation from his\r\nmaster to go to Baroda and lecture to that prince--and now he was\r\nmisbehaving in my dreams.  But all things can happen in dreams.  It is\r\nindeed as the Sweet Singer of Michigan says--irrelevantly, of course, for\r\nthe one and unfailing great quality which distinguishes her poetry from\r\nShakespeare's and makes it precious to us is its stern and simple\r\nirrelevancy:\r\n\r\n               My heart was gay and happy,\r\n               This was ever in my mind,\r\n               There is better times a coming,\r\n               And I hope some day to find\r\n               Myself capable of composing,\r\n               It was my heart's delight\r\n               To compose on a sentimental subject\r\n               If it came in my mind just right.\r\n\r\n--[\xe2\x80\x9cThe Sentimental Song Book,\xe2\x80\x9d p. 49; theme, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Author's Early Life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n 19th stanza.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBarroda.   Arrived at 7 this morning.  The dawn was just beginning to\r\nshow.  It was forlorn to have to turn out in a strange place at such a\r\ntime, and the blinking lights in the station made it seem night still.\r\nBut the gentlemen who had come to receive us were there with their\r\nservants, and they make quick work; there was no lost time.  We were soon\r\noutside and moving swiftly through the soft gray light, and presently\r\nwere comfortably housed--with more servants to help than we were used to,\r\nand with rather embarassingly important officials to direct them.  But it\r\nwas custom; they spoke Ballarat English, their bearing was charming and\r\nhospitable, and so all went well.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was a satisfaction.  Across the lawns was visible in the\r\ndistance through the open window an Indian well, with two oxen tramping\r\nleisurely up and down long inclines, drawing water; and out of the\r\nstillness came the suffering screech of the machinery--not quite musical,\r\nand yet soothingly melancholy and dreamy and reposeful--a wail of lost\r\nspirits, one might imagine.  And commemorative and reminiscent, perhaps;\r\nfor of course the Thugs used to throw people down that well when they\r\nwere done with them.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the day began, a sufficiently busy one.  We were driven\r\nby winding roads through a vast park, with noble forests of great trees,\r\nand with tangles and jungles of lovely growths of a humbler sort; and at\r\none place three large gray apes came out and pranced across the road--a\r\ngood deal of a surprise and an unpleasant one, for such creatures belong\r\nin the menagerie, and they look artificial and out of place in a\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nWe came to the city, by and by, and drove all through it.  Intensely\r\nIndian, it was, and crumbly, and mouldering, and immemorially old, to all\r\nappearance.  And the houses--oh, indescribably quaint and curious they\r\nwere, with their fronts an elaborate lace-work of intricate and beautiful\r\nwood-carving, and now and then further adorned with rude pictures of\r\nelephants and princes and gods done in shouting colors; and all the\r\nground floors along these cramped and narrow lanes occupied as shops\r\n--shops unbelievably small and impossibly packed with merchantable\r\nrubbish,\r\nand with nine-tenths-naked natives squatting at their work of hammering,\r\npounding, brazing, soldering, sewing, designing, cooking, measuring out\r\ngrain, grinding it, repairing idols--and then the swarm of ragged and\r\nnoisy humanity under the horses' feet and everywhere, and the pervading\r\nreek and fume and smell!  It was all wonderful and delightful.\r\n\r\nImagine a file of elephants marching through such a crevice of a street\r\nand scraping the paint off both sides of it with their hides.  How big\r\nthey must look, and how little they must make the houses look; and when\r\nthe elephants are in their glittering court costume, what a contrast they\r\nmust make with the humble and sordid surroundings.  And when a mad\r\nelephant goes raging through, belting right and left with his trunk, how\r\ndo these swarms of people get out of the way?  I suppose it is a thing\r\nwhich happens now and then in the mad season (for elephants have a mad\r\nseason).\r\n\r\nI wonder how old the town is.  There are patches of building--massive\r\nstructures, monuments, apparently--that are so battered and worn, and\r\nseemingly so tired and so burdened with the weight of age, and so dulled\r\nand stupefied with trying to remember things they forgot before history\r\nbegan, that they give one the feeling that they must have been a part of\r\noriginal Creation.  This is indeed one of the oldest of the princedoms of\r\nIndia, and has always been celebrated for its barbaric pomps and\r\nsplendors, and for the wealth of its princes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nIt takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt you to the\r\nheart; the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOut of the town again; a long drive through open country, by winding\r\nroads among secluded villages nestling in the inviting shade of tropic\r\nvegetation, a Sabbath stillness everywhere, sometimes a pervading sense\r\nof solitude, but always barefoot natives gliding by like spirits, without\r\nsound of footfall, and others in the distance dissolving away and\r\nvanishing like the creatures of dreams.  Now and then a string of stately\r\ncamels passed by--always interesting things to look at--and they were\r\nvelvet-shod by nature, and made no noise.  Indeed, there were no noises\r\nof any sort in this paradise.  Yes, once there was one, for a moment: a\r\nfile of native convicts passed along in charge of an officer, and we\r\ncaught the soft clink of their chains.  In a retired spot, resting\r\nhimself under a tree, was a holy person--a naked black fakeer, thin and\r\nskinny, and whitey-gray all over with ashes.\r\n\r\nBy and by to the elephant stables, and I took a ride; but it was by\r\nrequest--I did not ask for it, and didn't want it; but I took it, because\r\notherwise they would have thought I was afraid, which I was.  The\r\nelephant kneels down, by command--one end of him at a time--and you climb\r\nthe ladder and get into the howdah, and then he gets up, one end at a\r\ntime, just as a ship gets up over a wave; and after that, as he strides\r\nmonstrously about, his motion is much like a ship's motion.  The mahout\r\nbores into the back of his head with a great iron prod and you wonder at\r\nhis temerity and at the elephant's patience, and you think that perhaps\r\nthe patience will not last; but it does, and nothing happens.  The mahout\r\ntalks to the elephant in a low voice all the time, and the elephant seems\r\nto understand it all and to be pleased with it; and he obeys every order\r\nin the most contented and docile way.  Among these twenty-five elephants\r\nwere two which were larger than any I had ever seen before, and if I had\r\nthought I could learn to not be afraid, I would have taken one of them\r\nwhile the police were not looking.\r\n\r\nIn the howdah-house there were many howdahs that were made of silver, one\r\nof gold, and one of old ivory, and equipped with cushions and canopies of\r\nrich and costly stuffs.  The wardrobe of the elephants was there, too;\r\nvast velvet covers stiff and heavy with gold embroidery; and bells of\r\nsilver and gold; and ropes of these metals for fastening the things on--\r\nharness, so to speak; and monster hoops of massive gold for the elephant\r\nto wear on his ankles when he is out in procession on business of state.\r\n\r\nBut we did not see the treasury of crown jewels, and that was a\r\ndisappointment, for in mass and richness it ranks only second in India.\r\nBy mistake we were taken to see the new palace instead, and we used up\r\nthe last remnant of our spare time there.  It was a pity, too; for the\r\nnew palace is mixed modern American-European, and has not a merit except\r\ncostliness.  It is wholly foreign to India, and impudent and out of\r\nplace.  The architect has escaped.  This comes of overdoing the\r\nsuppression of the Thugs; they had their merits.  The old palace is\r\noriental and charming, and in consonance with the country.  The old\r\npalace would still be great if there were nothing of it but the spacious\r\nand lofty hall where the durbars are held.  It is not a good place to\r\nlecture in, on account of the echoes, but it is a good place to hold\r\ndurbars in and regulate the affairs of a kingdom, and that is what it is\r\nfor.  If I had it I would have a durbar every day, instead of once or\r\ntwice a year.\r\n\r\nThe prince is an educated gentleman.  His culture is European.  He has\r\nbeen in Europe five times.  People say that this is costly amusement for\r\nhim, since in crossing the sea he must sometimes be obliged to drink\r\nwater from vessels that are more or less public, and thus damage his\r\ncaste.  To get it purified again he must make pilgrimage to some renowned\r\nHindoo temples and contribute a fortune or two to them.  His people are\r\nlike the other Hindoos, profoundly religious; and they could not be\r\ncontent with a master who was impure.\r\n\r\nWe failed to see the jewels, but we saw the gold cannon and the silver\r\none--they seemed to be six-pounders.  They were not designed for\r\nbusiness, but for salutes upon rare and particularly important state\r\noccasions.  An ancestor of the present Gaikwar had the silver one made,\r\nand a subsequent ancestor had the gold one made, in order to outdo him.\r\n\r\nThis sort of artillery is in keeping with the traditions of Baroda, which\r\nwas of old famous for style and show.  It used to entertain visiting\r\nrajahs and viceroys with tiger-fights, elephant-fights, illuminations,\r\nand elephant-processions of the most glittering and gorgeous character.\r\n\r\nIt makes the circus a pale, poor thing.\r\n\r\nIn the train, during a part of the return journey from Baroda, we had the\r\ncompany of a gentleman who had with him a remarkable looking dog.  I had\r\nnot seen one of its kind before, as far as I could remember; though of\r\ncourse I might have seen one and not noticed it, for I am not acquainted\r\nwith dogs, but only with cats.  This dog's coat was smooth and shiny and\r\nblack, and I think it had tan trimmings around the edges of the dog, and\r\nperhaps underneath.  It was a long, low dog, with very short, strange\r\nlegs--legs that curved inboard, something like parentheses turned the\r\nwrong way (.\r\nIndeed, it was made on the plan of a bench for length and lowness.  It\r\nseemed to be satisfied, but I thought the plan poor, and structurally\r\nweak, on account of the distance between the forward supports and those\r\nabaft.  With age the dog's back was likely to sag; and it seemed to me\r\nthat it would have been a stronger and more practicable dog if it had had\r\nsome more legs.  It had not begun to sag yet, but the shape of the legs\r\nshowed that the undue weight imposed upon them was beginning to tell.\r\nIt had a long nose, and floppy ears that hung down, and a resigned\r\nexpression of countenance.  I did not like to ask what kind of a dog it\r\nwas, or how it came to be deformed, for it was plain that the gentleman\r\nwas very fond of it, and naturally he could be sensitive about it.  From\r\ndelicacy I thought it best not to seem to notice it too much.  No doubt a\r\nman with a dog like that feels just as a person does who has a child that\r\nis out of true.  The gentleman was not merely fond of the dog, he was\r\nalso proud of it--just the same again, as a mother feels about her\r\nchild when it is an idiot.  I could see that he was proud of it,\r\nnot-withstanding it was such a long dog and looked so resigned and pious.\r\nIt had been all over the world with him, and had been pilgriming like\r\nthat for years and years.  It had traveled 50,000 miles by sea and rail,\r\nand had ridden in front of him on his horse 8,000.  It had a silver medal\r\nfrom the Geographical Society of Great Britain for its travels, and I saw\r\nit.  It had won prizes in dog shows, both in India and in England--I saw\r\nthem.  He said its pedigree was on record in the Kennel Club, and that it\r\nwas a well-known dog.  He said a great many people in London could\r\nrecognize it the moment they saw it.  I did not say anything, but I did\r\nnot think it anything strange; I should know that dog again, myself, yet\r\nI am not careful about noticing dogs.  He said that when he walked along\r\nin London, people often stopped and looked at the dog.  Of course I did\r\nnot say anything, for I did not want to hurt his feelings, but I could\r\nhave explained to him that if you take a great long low dog like that and\r\nwaddle it along the street anywhere in the world and not charge anything,\r\npeople will stop and look.  He was gratified because the dog took prizes.\r\nBut that was nothing; if I were built like that I could take prizes\r\nmyself.  I wished I knew what kind of a dog it was, and what it was for,\r\nbut I could not very well ask, for that would show that I did not know.\r\nNot that I want a dog like that, but only to know the secret of its\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nI think he was going to hunt elephants with it, because I know, from\r\nremarks dropped by him, that he has hunted large game in India and\r\nAfrica, and likes it.  But I think that if he tries to hunt elephants\r\nwith it, he is going to be disappointed.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that it is suited for elephants.  It lacks energy, it\r\nlacks force of character, it lacks bitterness.  These things all show in\r\nthe meekness and resignation of its expression.  It would not attack an\r\nelephant, I am sure of it.  It might not run if it saw one coming, but it\r\nlooked to me like a dog that would sit down and pray.\r\n\r\nI wish he had told me what breed it was, if there are others; but I shall\r\nknow the dog next time, and then if I can bring myself to it I will put\r\ndelicacy aside and ask.  If I seem strangely interested in dogs, I have a\r\nreason for it; for a dog saved me from an embarrassing position once, and\r\nthat has made me grateful to these animals; and if by study I could learn\r\nto tell some of the kinds from the others, I should be greatly pleased.\r\nI only know one kind apart, yet, and that is the kind that saved me that\r\ntime.  I always know that kind when I meet it, and if it is hungry or\r\nlost I take care of it.  The matter happened in this way:\r\n\r\nIt was years and years ago.  I had received a note from Mr. Augustin Daly\r\nof the Fifth Avenue Theatre, asking me to call the next time I should be\r\nin New York.  I was writing plays, in those days, and he was admiring\r\nthem and trying to get me a chance to get them played in Siberia.  I took\r\nthe first train--the early one--the one that leaves Hartford at 8.29 in\r\nthe morning.  At New Haven I bought a paper, and found it filled with\r\nglaring display-lines about a \xe2\x80\x9cbench-show\xe2\x80\x9d there.  I had often heard of\r\nbench-shows, but had never felt any interest in them, because I supposed\r\nthey were lectures that were not well attended.  It turned out, now, that\r\nit was not that, but a dog-show.  There was a double-leaded column about\r\nthe king-feature of this one, which was called a Saint Bernard, and was\r\nworth $10,000, and was known to be the largest and finest of his species\r\nin the world.  I read all this with interest, because out of my\r\nschool-boy readings I dimly remembered how the priests and pilgrims of\r\nSt. Bernard used to go out in the storms and dig these dogs out of the\r\nsnowdrifts when lost and exhausted, and give them brandy and save their\r\nlives, and drag them to the monastery and restore them with gruel.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was a picture of this prize-dog in the paper, a noble great\r\ncreature with a benignant countenance, standing by a table.  He was\r\nplaced in that way so that one could get a right idea of his great\r\ndimensions.  You could see that he was just a shade higher than the\r\ntable--indeed, a huge fellow for a dog.  Then there was a description\r\nwhich went into the details.  It gave his enormous weight--150 1/2\r\npounds, and his length 4 feet 2 inches, from stem to stern-post; and his\r\nheight--3 feet 1 inch, to the top of his back.  The pictures and the\r\nfigures so impressed me, that I could see the beautiful colossus before\r\nme, and I kept on thinking about him for the next two hours; then I\r\nreached New York, and he dropped out of my mind.\r\n\r\nIn the swirl and tumult of the hotel lobby I ran across Mr. Daly's\r\ncomedian, the late James Lewis, of beloved memory, and I casually\r\nmentioned that I was going to call upon Mr. Daly in the evening at 8.\r\nHe looked surprised, and said he reckoned not.  For answer I handed him\r\nMr. Daly's note.  Its substance was: \xe2\x80\x9cCome to my private den, over the\r\ntheater, where we cannot be interrupted.  And come by the back way, not\r\nthe front.  No. 642 Sixth Avenue is a cigar shop; pass through it and you\r\nare in a paved court, with high buildings all around; enter the second\r\ndoor on the left, and come up stairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you'll never get in\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you won't.  Or if you do you can draw on me for a hundred\r\ndollars; for you will be the first man that has accomplished it in\r\ntwenty-five years.  I can't think what Mr. Daly can have been absorbed\r\nin.  He has forgotten a most important detail, and he will feel\r\nhumiliated in the morning when he finds that you tried to get in and\r\ncouldn't.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what is the trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll tell you.  You see----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt that point we were swept apart by the crowd, somebody detained me with\r\na moment's talk, and we did not get together again.  But it did not\r\nmatter; I believed he was joking, anyway.\r\n\r\nAt eight in the evening I passed through the cigar shop and into the\r\ncourt and knocked at the second door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI entered.  It was a small room, carpetless, dusty, with a naked deal\r\ntable, and two cheap wooden chairs for furniture.  A giant Irishman was\r\nstanding there, with shirt collar and vest unbuttoned, and no coat on.  I\r\nput my hat on the table, and was about to say something, when the\r\nIrishman took the innings himself.  And not with marked courtesy of tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sor, what will you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was a little disconcerted, and my easy confidence suffered a shrinkage.\r\nThe man stood as motionless as Gibraltar, and kept his unblinking eye\r\nupon me.  It was very embarrassing, very humiliating.  I stammered at a\r\nfalse start or two; then----\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have just run down from----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAv ye plaze, ye'll not smoke here, ye understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI laid my cigar on the window-ledge; chased my flighty thoughts a moment,\r\nthen said in a placating manner:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI--I have come to see Mr. Daly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, ye have, have ye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, ye'll not see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut he asked me to come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he did, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he sent me this note, and----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLemme see it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment I fancied there would be a change in the atmosphere, now;\r\nbut this idea was premature.  The big man was examining the note\r\nsearchingly under the gas-jet.  A glance showed me that he had it upside\r\ndown--disheartening evidence that he could not read.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs ut his own handwrite?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes--he wrote it himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe did, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH'm.  Well, then, why ud he write it like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mane, why wudn't he put his naime to ut?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis name is to it.  That's not it--you are looking at my name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought that that was a home shot, but he did not betray that he had\r\nbeen hit.  He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's not an aisy one to spell; how do you pronounce ut?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMark Twain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH'm.  H'm.  Mike Train.  H'm.  I don't remember ut.  What is it ye want\r\nto see him about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn't I that want to see him, he wants to see me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, he does, does he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does he want to see ye about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe don't know!  And ye confess it, becod!  Well, I can tell ye wan\r\nthing--ye'll not see him.  Are ye in the business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat business?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe show business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fatal question.  I recognized that I was defeated.  If I answered no,\r\nhe would cut the matter short and wave me to the door without the grace\r\nof a word--I saw it in his uncompromising eye; if I said I was a\r\nlecturer, he would despise me, and dismiss me with opprobrious words; if\r\nI said I was a dramatist, he would throw me out of the window.  I saw\r\nthat my case was hopeless, so I chose the course which seemed least\r\nhumiliating: I would pocket my shame and glide out without answering.\r\nThe silence was growing lengthy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI'll ask ye again.  Are ye in the show business yerself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said it with splendid confidence; for in that moment the very twin of\r\nthat grand New Haven dog loafed into the room, and I saw that Irishman's\r\neye light eloquently with pride and affection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are?  And what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI've got a bench-show in New Haven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe weather did change then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don't say, sir!  And that's your show, sir!  Oh, it's a grand show,\r\nit's a wonderful show, sir, and a proud man I am to see your honor this\r\nday.  And ye'll be an expert, sir, and ye'll know all about dogs--more\r\nthan ever they know theirselves, I'll take me oath to ut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, with modesty:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI believe I have some reputation that way.  In fact, my business\r\nrequires it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe have some reputation, your honor!  Bedad I believe you!  There's not\r\na jintleman in the worrld that can lay over ye in the judgmint of a dog,\r\nsir.  Now I'll vinture that your honor'll know that dog's dimensions\r\nthere better than he knows them his own self, and just by the casting of\r\nyour educated eye upon him.  Would you mind giving a guess, if ye'll be\r\nso good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew that upon my answer would depend my fate.  If I made this dog\r\nbigger than the prize-dog, it would be bad diplomacy, and suspicious; if\r\nI fell too far short of the prizedog, that would be equally damaging.\r\nThe dog was standing by the table, and I believed I knew the difference\r\nbetween him and the one whose picture I had seen in the newspaper to a\r\nshade.  I spoke promptly up and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's no trouble to guess this noble creature's figures: height, three\r\nfeet; length, four feet and three-quarters of an inch; weight, a hundred\r\nand forty-eight and a quarter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man snatched his hat from its peg and danced on it with joy,\r\nshouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe've hardly missed it the hair's breadth, hardly the shade of a shade,\r\nyour honor!  Oh, it's the miraculous eye ye've got, for the judgmint of a\r\ndog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd still pouring out his admiration of my capacities, he snatched off\r\nhis vest and scoured off one of the wooden chairs with it, and scrubbed\r\nit and polished it, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sit down, your honor, I'm ashamed of meself that I forgot ye were\r\nstanding all this time; and do put on your hat, ye mustn't take cold,\r\nit's a drafty place; and here is your cigar, sir, a getting cold, I'll\r\ngive ye a light.  There.  The place is all yours, sir, and if ye'll just\r\nput your feet on the table and make yourself at home, I'll stir around\r\nand get a candle and light ye up the ould crazy stairs and see that ye\r\ndon't come to anny harm, for be this time Mr. Daly'll be that impatient\r\nto see your honor that he'll be taking the roof off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe conducted me cautiously and tenderly up the stairs, lighting the way\r\nand protecting me with friendly warnings, then pushed the door open and\r\nbowed me in and went his way, mumbling hearty things about my wonderful\r\neye for points of a dog.  Mr. Daly was writing and had his back to me.\r\nHe glanced over his shoulder presently, then jumped up and said--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, dear me, I forgot all about giving instructions.  I was just writing\r\nyou to beg a thousand pardons.  But how is it you are here?  How did you\r\nget by that Irishman?  You are the first man that's done it in five and\r\ntwenty years.  You didn't bribe him, I know that; there's not money\r\nenough in New York to do it.  And you didn't persuade him; he is all ice\r\nand iron: there isn't a soft place nor a warm one in him anywhere.  What\r\nis your secret?  Look here; you owe me a hundred dollars for\r\nunintentionally giving you a chance to perform a miracle--for it is a\r\nmiracle that you've done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all right,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9ccollect it of Jimmy Lewis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat good dog not only did me that good turn in the time of my need, but\r\nhe won for me the envious reputation among all the theatrical people from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific of being the only man in history who had ever\r\nrun the blockade of Augustin Daly's back door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nIf the desire to kill and the opportunity to kill came always together,\r\nwho would escape hanging.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOn the Train.  Fifty years ago, when I was a boy in the then remote and\r\nsparsely peopled Mississippi valley, vague tales and rumors of a\r\nmysterious body of professional murderers came wandering in from a\r\ncountry which was constructively as far from us as the constellations\r\nblinking in space--India; vague tales and rumors of a sect called Thugs,\r\nwho waylaid travelers in lonely places and killed them for the\r\ncontentment of a god whom they worshiped; tales which everybody liked to\r\nlisten to and nobody believed, except with reservations.  It was\r\nconsidered that the stories had gathered bulk on their travels.  The\r\nmatter died down and a lull followed.  Then Eugene Sue's \xe2\x80\x9cWandering Jew\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n appeared, and made great talk for a while.  One character in it was a\r\nchief of Thugs--\xe2\x80\x9cFeringhea\xe2\x80\x9d--a mysterious and terrible Indian who was as\r\nslippery and sly as a serpent, and as deadly; and he stirred up the Thug\r\ninterest once more.  But it did not last.  It presently died again this\r\ntime to stay dead.\r\n\r\nAt first glance it seems strange that this should have happened; but\r\nreally it was not strange--on the contrary--it was natural; I mean on\r\nour side of the water.  For the source whence the Thug tales mainly came\r\nwas a Government Report, and without doubt was not republished in\r\nAmerica; it was probably never even seen there.  Government Reports have\r\nno general circulation.  They are distributed to the few, and are not\r\nalways read by those few.  I heard of this Report for the first time a\r\nday or two ago, and borrowed it.  It is full of fascinations; and it\r\nturns those dim, dark fairy tales of my boyhood days into realities.\r\n\r\nThe Report was made in 1839 by Major Sleeman, of the Indian Service, and\r\nwas printed in Calcutta in 1840.  It is a clumsy, great, fat, poor sample\r\nof the printer's art, but good enough for a government printing-office in\r\nthat old day and in that remote region, perhaps.  To Major Sleeman was\r\ngiven the general superintendence of the giant task of ridding India of\r\nThuggee, and he and his seventeen assistants accomplished it.  It was the\r\nAugean Stables over again.  Captain Vallancey, writing in a Madras\r\njournal in those old times, makes this remark:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe day that sees this far-spread evil eradicated from India and\r\n     known only in name, will greatly tend to immortalize British rule in\r\n     the East.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe did not overestimate the magnitude and difficulty of the work, nor the\r\nimmensity of the credit which would justly be due to British rule in case\r\nit was accomplished.\r\n\r\nThuggee became known to the British authorities in India about 1810, but\r\nits wide prevalence was not suspected; it was not regarded as a serious\r\nmatter, and no systematic measures were taken for its suppression until\r\nabout 1830.  About that time Major Sleeman captured Eugene Sue's\r\nThug-chief, \xe2\x80\x9cFeringhea,\xe2\x80\x9d and got him to turn King's evidence.  The\r\nrevelations were so stupefying that Sleeman was not able to believe them.\r\nSleeman thought he knew every criminal within his jurisdiction, and that\r\nthe worst of them were merely thieves; but Feringhea told him that he was\r\nin reality living in the midst of a swarm of professional murderers; that\r\nthey had been all about him for many years, and that they buried their\r\ndead close by.  These seemed insane tales; but Feringhea said come and\r\nsee--and he took him to a grave and dug up a hundred bodies, and told him\r\nall the circumstances of the killings, and named the Thugs who had done\r\nthe work.  It was a staggering business.  Sleeman captured some of these\r\nThugs and proceeded to examine them separately, and with proper\r\nprecautions against collusion; for he would not believe any Indian's\r\nunsupported word.  The evidence gathered proved the truth of what\r\nFeringhea had said, and also revealed the fact that gangs of Thugs were\r\nplying their trade all over India.  The astonished government now took\r\nhold of Thuggee, and for ten years made systematic and relentless war\r\nupon it, and finally destroyed it.  Gang after gang was captured, tried,\r\nand punished.  The Thugs were harried and hunted from one end of India to\r\nthe other.  The government got all their secrets out of them; and also\r\ngot the names of the members of the bands, and recorded them in a book,\r\ntogether with their birthplaces and places of residence.\r\n\r\nThe Thugs were worshipers of Bhowanee; and to this god they sacrificed\r\nanybody that came handy; but they kept the dead man's things themselves,\r\nfor the god cared for nothing but the corpse.  Men were initiated into\r\nthe sect with solemn ceremonies.  Then they were taught how to strangle a\r\nperson with the sacred choke-cloth, but were not allowed to perform\r\nofficially with it until after long practice.  No half-educated strangler\r\ncould choke a man to death quickly enough to keep him from uttering a\r\nsound--a muffled scream, gurgle, gasp, moan, or something of the sort;\r\nbut the expert's work was instantaneous: the cloth was whipped around the\r\nvictim's neck, there was a sudden twist, and the head fell silently\r\nforward, the eyes starting from the sockets; and all was over.  The Thug\r\ncarefully guarded against resistance.  It was usual to to get the victims\r\nto sit down, for that was the handiest position for business.\r\n\r\nIf the Thug had planned India itself it could not have been more\r\nconveniently arranged for the needs of his occupation.\r\n\r\nThere were no public conveyances.  There were no conveyances for hire.\r\nThe traveler went on foot or in a bullock cart or on a horse which he\r\nbought for the purpose.  As soon as he was out of his own little State or\r\nprincipality he was among strangers; nobody knew him, nobody took note of\r\nhim, and from that time his movements could no longer be traced.  He did\r\nnot stop in towns or villages, but camped outside of them and sent his\r\nservants in to buy provisions.  There were no habitations between\r\nvillages.  Whenever he was between villages he was an easy prey,\r\nparticularly as he usually traveled by night, to avoid the heat.  He was\r\nalways being overtaken by strangers who offered him the protection of\r\ntheir company, or asked for the protection of his--and these strangers\r\nwere often Thugs, as he presently found out to his cost.  The\r\nlandholders, the native police, the petty princes, the village officials,\r\nthe customs officers were in many cases protectors and harborers of the\r\nThugs, and betrayed travelers to them for a share of the spoil.  At first\r\nthis condition of things made it next to impossible for the government to\r\ncatch the marauders; they were spirited away by these watchful friends.\r\nAll through a vast continent, thus infested, helpless people of every\r\ncaste and kind moved along the paths and trails in couples and groups\r\nsilently by night, carrying the commerce of the country--treasure,\r\njewels, money, and petty batches of silks, spices, and all manner of\r\nwares.  It was a paradise for the Thug.\r\n\r\nWhen the autumn opened, the Thugs began to gather together by\r\npre-concert.  Other people had to have interpreters at every turn, but\r\nnot the Thugs; they could talk together, no matter how far apart they\r\nwere born, for they had a language of their own, and they had secret\r\nsigns by which they knew each other for Thugs; and they were always\r\nfriends.  Even their diversities of religion and caste were sunk in\r\ndevotion to their calling, and the Moslem and the high-caste and\r\nlow-caste Hindoo were staunch and affectionate brothers in Thuggery.\r\n\r\nWhen a gang had been assembled, they had religious worship, and waited\r\nfor an omen.  They had definite notions about the omens.  The cries of\r\ncertain animals were good omens, the cries of certain other creatures\r\nwere bad omens.  A bad omen would stop proceedings and send the men home.\r\n\r\nThe sword and the strangling-cloth were sacred emblems.  The Thugs\r\nworshiped the sword at home before going out to the assembling-place; the\r\nstrangling-cloth was worshiped at the place of assembly.  The chiefs of\r\nmost of the bands performed the religious ceremonies themselves; but the\r\nKaets delegated them to certain official stranglers (Chaurs).  The rites\r\nof the Kaets were so holy that no one but the Chaur was allowed to touch\r\nthe vessels and other things used in them.\r\n\r\nThug methods exhibit a curious mixture of caution and the absence of it;\r\ncold business calculation and sudden, unreflecting impulse; but there\r\nwere two details which were constant, and not subject to caprice: patient\r\npersistence in following up the prey, and pitilessness when the time came\r\nto act.\r\n\r\nCaution was exhibited in the strength of the bands.  They never felt\r\ncomfortable and confident unless their strength exceeded that of any\r\nparty of travelers they were likely to meet by four or fivefold.  Yet it\r\nwas never their purpose to attack openly, but only when the victims were\r\noff their guard.  When they got hold of a party of travelers they often\r\nmoved along in their company several days, using all manner of arts to\r\nwin their friendship and get their confidence.  At last, when this was\r\naccomplished to their satisfaction, the real business began.  A few Thugs\r\nwere privately detached and sent forward in the dark to select a good\r\nkilling-place and dig the graves.  When the rest reached the spot a halt\r\nwas called, for a rest or a smoke.  The travelers were invited to sit.\r\nBy signs, the chief appointed certain Thugs to sit down in front of the\r\ntravelers as if to wait upon them, others to sit down beside them and\r\nengage them in conversation, and certain expert stranglers to stand\r\nbehind the travelers and be ready when the signal was given.  The signal\r\nwas usually some commonplace remark, like \xe2\x80\x9cBring the tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sometimes\r\na considerable wait ensued after all the actors were in their places--the\r\nchief was biding his time, in order to make everything sure.  Meantime,\r\nthe talk droned on, dim figures moved about in the dull light, peace and\r\ntranquility reigned, the travelers resigned themselves to the pleasant\r\nreposefulness and comfort of the situation, unconscious of the\r\ndeath-angels standing motionless at their backs.  The time was ripe, now,\r\nand the signal came: \xe2\x80\x9cBring the tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was a mute swift\r\nmovement, all in the same instant the men at each victim's sides seized\r\nhis hands, the man in front seized his feet, and pulled, the man at his\r\nback whipped the cloth around his neck and gave it a twist--the head sunk\r\nforward, the tragedy was over.  The bodies were stripped and covered up\r\nin the graves, the spoil packed for transportation, then the Thugs gave\r\npious thanks to Bhowanee, and departed on further holy service.\r\n\r\nThe Report shows that the travelers moved in exceedingly small groups\r\n--twos, threes, fours, as a rule; a party with a dozen in it was rare.\r\nThe\r\nThugs themselves seem to have been the only people who moved in force.\r\nThey went about in gangs of 10, 15, 25, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200, 250, and\r\none gang of 310 is mentioned.  Considering their numbers, their catch was\r\nnot extraordinary--particularly when you consider that they were not in\r\nthe least fastidious, but took anybody they could get, whether rich or\r\npoor, and sometimes even killed children.  Now and then they killed\r\nwomen, but it was considered sinful to do it, and unlucky.  The \xe2\x80\x9cseason\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n was six or eight months long.  One season the half dozen Bundelkand and\r\nGwalior gangs aggregated 712 men, and they murdered 210 people.  One\r\nseason the Malwa and Kandeish gangs aggregated 702 men, and they murdered\r\n232.  One season the Kandeish and Berar gangs aggregated 963 men, and\r\nthey murdered 385 people.\r\n\r\nHere is the tally-sheet of a gang of sixty Thugs for a whole season--gang\r\nunder two noted chiefs, \xe2\x80\x9cChotee and Sheik Nungoo from Gwalior\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLeft Poora, in Jhansee, and on arrival at Sarora murdered a\r\n     traveler.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cOn nearly reaching Bhopal, met 3 Brahmins, and murdered them.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCross the Nerbudda; at a village called Hutteea, murdered a Hindoo.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWent through Aurungabad to Walagow; there met a Havildar of the\r\n     barber caste and 5 sepoys (native soldiers); in the evening came to\r\n     Jokur, and in the morning killed them near the place where the\r\n     treasure-bearers were killed the year before.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBetween Jokur and Dholeea met a sepoy of the shepherd caste; killed\r\n     him in the jungle.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cPassed through Dholeea and lodged in a village; two miles beyond,\r\n     on the road to Indore, met a Byragee (beggar-holy mendicant);\r\n     murdered him at the Thapa.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning, beyond the Thapa, fell in with 3 Marwarie\r\n     travelers; murdered them.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNear a village on the banks of the Taptee met 4 travelers and\r\n     killed them.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBetween Choupra and Dhoreea met a Marwarie; murdered him.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt Dhoreea met 3 Marwaries; took them two miles and murdered them.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cTwo miles further on, overtaken by three treasure-bearers; took\r\n     them two miles and murdered them in the jungle.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCame on to Khurgore Bateesa in Indore, divided spoil, and\r\n     dispersed.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cA total of 27 men murdered on one expedition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nChotee (to save his neck) was informer, and furnished these facts.\r\nSeveral things are noticeable about his resume.  1. Business brevity;\r\n2, absence of emotion; 3, smallness of the parties encountered by the 60;\r\n4, variety in character and quality of the game captured; 5, Hindoo and\r\nMohammedan chiefs in business together for Bhowanee; 6, the sacred caste\r\nof the Brahmins not respected by either; 7, nor yet the character of that\r\nmendicant, that Byragee.\r\n\r\nA beggar is a holy creature, and some of the gangs spared him on that\r\naccount, no matter how slack business might be; but other gangs\r\nslaughtered not only him, but even that sacredest of sacred creatures,\r\nthe fakeer--that repulsive skin-and-bone thing that goes around naked and\r\nmats his bushy hair with dust and dirt, and so beflours his lean body\r\nwith ashes that he looks like a specter.  Sometimes a fakeer trusted a\r\nshade too far in the protection of his sacredness.  In the middle of a\r\ntally-sheet of Feringhea's, who had been out with forty Thugs, I find a\r\ncase of the kind.  After the killing of thirty-nine men and one woman,\r\nthe fakeer appears on the scene:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cApproaching Doregow, met 3 pundits; also a fakeer, mounted on a\r\n     pony; he was plastered over with sugar to collect flies, and was\r\n     covered with them.  Drove off the fakeer, and killed the other\r\n     three.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLeaving Doregow, the fakeer joined again, and went on in company to\r\n     Raojana; met 6 Khutries on their way from Bombay to Nagpore.  Drove\r\n     off the fakeer with stones, and killed the 6 men in camp, and buried\r\n     them in the grove.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cNext day the fakeer joined again; made him leave at Mana.  Beyond\r\n     there, fell in with two Kahars and a sepoy, and came on towards the\r\n     place selected for the murder.  When near it, the fakeer came again.\r\n     Losing all patience with him, gave Mithoo, one of the gang, 5 rupees\r\n     ($2.50) to murder him, and take the sin upon himself.  All four were\r\n     strangled, including the fakeer.  Surprised to find among the\r\n     fakeer's effects 30 pounds of coral, 350 strings of small pearls, 15\r\n     strings of large pearls, and a gilt necklace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt it curious, the little effect that time has upon a really interesting\r\ncircumstance.  This one, so old, so long ago gone down into oblivion,\r\nreads with the same freshness and charm that attach to the news in the\r\nmorning paper; one's spirits go up, then down, then up again, following\r\nthe chances which the fakeer is running; now you hope, now you despair,\r\nnow you hope again; and at last everything comes out right, and you feel\r\na great wave of personal satisfaction go weltering through you, and\r\nwithout thinking, you put out your hand to pat Mithoo on the back, when\r\n--puff! the whole thing has vanished away, there is nothing there; Mithoo\r\nand all the crowd have been dust and ashes and forgotten, oh, so many,\r\nmany, many lagging years!  And then comes a sense of injury: you don't\r\nknow whether Mithoo got the swag, along with the sin, or had to divide up\r\nthe swag and keep all the sin himself.  There is no literary art about a\r\ngovernment report.  It stops a story right in the most interesting place.\r\n\r\nThese reports of Thug expeditions run along interminably in one\r\nmonotonous tune: \xe2\x80\x9cMet a sepoy--killed him; met 5 pundits--killed them;\r\nmet 4 Rajpoots and a woman--killed them\xe2\x80\x9d--and so on, till the statistics\r\nget to be pretty dry.  But this small trip of Feringhea's Forty had some\r\nlittle variety about it.  Once they came across a man hiding in a grave\r\n--a thief; he had stolen 1,100 rupees from Dhunroj Seith of Parowtee.\r\nThey strangled him and took the money.  They had no patience with\r\nthieves.\r\nThey killed two treasure-bearers, and got 4,000 rupees.  They came across\r\ntwo bullocks \xe2\x80\x9claden with copper pice,\xe2\x80\x9d and killed the four drivers and\r\ntook the money.  There must have been half a ton of it.  I think it takes\r\na double handful of pice to make an anna, and 16 annas to make a rupee;\r\nand even in those days the rupee was worth only half a dollar.  Coming\r\nback over their tracks from Baroda, they had another picturesque stroke\r\nof luck:  \xe2\x80\x9c'The Lohars of Oodeypore' put a traveler in their charge for\r\nsafety.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dear, dear, across this abyssmal gulf of time we still see\r\nFeringhea's lips uncover his teeth, and through the dim haze we catch the\r\nincandescent glimmer of his smile.  He accepted that trust, good man; and\r\nso we know what went with the traveler.\r\n\r\nEven Rajahs had no terrors for Feringhea; he came across an\r\nelephant-driver belonging to the Rajah of Oodeypore and promptly\r\nstrangled him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA total of 100 men and 5 women murdered on this expedition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmong the reports of expeditions we find mention of victims of almost\r\nevery quality and estate:\r\n\r\nNative soldiers.\r\nFakeers.\r\nMendicants.\r\nHoly-water carriers.\r\nCarpenters.\r\nPeddlers.\r\nTailors.\r\nBlacksmiths.\r\nPolicemen (native).\r\nPastry cooks.\r\nGrooms.\r\nMecca pilgrims.\r\nChuprassies.\r\nTreasure-bearers.\r\nChildren.\r\nCowherds.\r\n\r\nGardeners.\r\nShopkeepers.\r\nPalanquin-bearers.\r\nFarmers.\r\nBullock-drivers.\r\nMale servants seeking work.\r\nWomen servants seeking work.\r\nShepherds.\r\nArchers.\r\nTable-waiters.\r\nWeavers.\r\nPriests.\r\nBankers.\r\nBoatmen.\r\nMerchants.\r\nGrass-cutters.\r\n\r\nAlso a prince's cook; and even the water-carrier of that sublime lord of\r\nlords and king of kings, the Governor-General of India!  How broad they\r\nwere in their tastes!  They also murdered actors--poor wandering\r\nbarnstormers.  There are two instances recorded; the first one by a gang\r\nof Thugs under a chief who soils a great name borne by a better man\r\n--Kipling's deathless \xe2\x80\x9cGungadin\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAfter murdering 4 sepoys, going on toward Indore, met 4 strolling\r\n     players, and persuaded them to come with us, on the pretense that we\r\n     would see their performance at the next stage.  Murdered them at a\r\n     temple near Bhopal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSecond instance:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt Deohuttee, joined by comedians.  Murdered them eastward of that\r\n     place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut this gang was a particularly bad crew.  On that expedition they\r\nmurdered a fakeer and twelve beggars.  And yet Bhowanee protected them;\r\nfor once when they were strangling a man in a wood when a crowd was going\r\nby close at hand and the noose slipped and the man screamed, Bhowanee\r\nmade a camel burst out at the same moment with a roar that drowned the\r\nscream; and before the man could repeat it the breath was choked out of\r\nhis body.\r\n\r\nThe cow is so sacred in India that to kill her keeper is an awful\r\nsacrilege, and even the Thugs recognized this; yet now and then the lust\r\nfor blood was too strong, and so they did kill a few cow-keepers.  In one\r\nof these instances the witness who killed the cowherd said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Thuggee\r\nthis is strictly forbidden, and is an act from which no good can come.  I\r\nwas ill of a fever for ten days afterward.  I do believe that evil will\r\nfollow the murder of a man with a cow.  If there be no cow it does not\r\nsignify.\xe2\x80\x9d  Another Thug said he held the cowherd's feet while this\r\nwitness did the strangling.  He felt no concern, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the bad fortune\r\nof such a deed is upon the strangler and not upon the assistants; even if\r\nthere should be a hundred of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere were thousands of Thugs roving over India constantly, during many\r\ngenerations.  They made Thuggee a hereditary vocation and taught it to\r\ntheir sons and to their son's sons.  Boys were in full membership as\r\nearly as 16 years of age; veterans were still at work at 70.  What was\r\nthe fascination, what was the impulse?  Apparently, it was partly piety,\r\nlargely gain, and there is reason to suspect that the sport afforded was\r\nthe chiefest fascination of all.  Meadows Taylor makes a Thug in one of\r\nhis books claim that the pleasure of killing men was the white man's\r\nbeast-hunting instinct enlarged, refined, ennobled.  I will quote the\r\npassage:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nSimple rules for saving money: To save half, when you are fired by an\r\neager impulse to contribute to a charity, wait, and count forty.  To save\r\nthree-quarters, count sixty.  To save it all, count sixty-five.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe Thug said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow many of you English are passionately devoted to sporting!  Your days\r\nand months are passed in its excitement.  A tiger, a panther, a buffalo\r\nor a hog rouses your utmost energies for its destruction--you even risk\r\nyour lives in its pursuit.  How much higher game is a Thug's!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat must really be the secret of the rise and development of Thuggee.\r\nThe joy of killing! the joy of seeing killing done--these are traits of\r\nthe human race at large.  We white people are merely modified Thugs;\r\nThugs fretting under the restraints of a not very thick skin of\r\ncivilization; Thugs who long ago enjoyed the slaughter of the Roman\r\narena, and later the burning of doubtful Christians by authentic\r\nChristians in the public squares, and who now, with the Thugs of Spain\r\nand Nimes, flock to enjoy the blood and misery of the bullring.  We have\r\nno tourists of either sex or any religion who are able to resist the\r\ndelights of the bull-ring when opportunity offers; and we are gentle\r\nThugs in the hunting-season, and love to chase a tame rabbit and kill it.\r\nStill, we have made some progress-microscopic, and in truth scarcely\r\nworth mentioning, and certainly nothing to be proud of--still, it is\r\nprogress: we no longer take pleasure in slaughtering or burning helpless\r\nmen.  We have reached a little altitude where we may look down upon the\r\nIndian Thugs with a complacent shudder; and we may even hope for a day,\r\nmany centuries hence, when our posterity will look down upon us in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nThere are many indications that the Thug often hunted men for the mere\r\nsport of it; that the fright and pain of the quarry were no more to him\r\nthan are the fright and pain of the rabbit or the stag to us; and that he\r\nwas no more ashamed of beguiling his game with deceits and abusing its\r\ntrust than are we when we have imitated a wild animal's call and shot it\r\nwhen it honored us with its confidence and came to see what we wanted:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMadara, son of Nihal, and I, Ramzam, set out from Kotdee in the\r\n     cold weather and followed the high road for about twenty days in\r\n     search of travelers, until we came to Selempore, where we met a very\r\n     old man going to the east.  We won his confidence in this manner: he\r\n     carried a load which was too heavy for his old age; I said to him,\r\n     'You are an old man, I will aid you in carrying your load, as you\r\n     are from my part of the country.'  He said, 'Very well, take me with\r\n     you.'  So we took him with us to Selempore, where we slept that\r\n     night.  We woke him next morning before dawn and set out, and at the\r\n     distance of three miles we seated him to rest while it was still\r\n     very dark.  Madara was ready behind him, and strangled him.  He\r\n     never spoke a word.  He was about 60 or 70 years of age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother gang fell in with a couple of barbers and persuaded them to come\r\nalong in their company by promising them the job of shaving the whole\r\ncrew--30 Thugs.  At the place appointed for the murder 15 got shaved, and\r\nactually paid the barbers for their work.  Then killed them and took back\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\nA gang of forty-two Thugs came across two Brahmins and a shopkeeper on\r\nthe road, beguiled them into a grove and got up a concert for their\r\nentertainment.  While these poor fellows were listening to the music the\r\nstranglers were standing behind them; and at the proper moment for\r\ndramatic effect they applied the noose.\r\n\r\nThe most devoted fisherman must have a bite at least as often as once\r\na week or his passion will cool and he will put up his tackle.  The\r\ntiger-sportsman must find a tiger at least once a fortnight or he will\r\nget\r\ntired and quit.  The elephant-hunter's enthusiasm will waste away little\r\nby little, and his zeal will perish at last if he plod around a month\r\nwithout finding a member of that noble family to assassinate.\r\n\r\nBut when the lust in the hunter's heart is for the noblest of all\r\nquarries, man, how different is the case! and how watery and poor is the\r\nzeal and how childish the endurance of those other hunters by comparison.\r\nThen, neither hunger, nor thirst, nor fatigue, nor deferred hope, nor\r\nmonotonous disappointment, nor leaden-footed lapse of time can conquer\r\nthe hunter's patience or weaken the joy of his quest or cool the splendid\r\nrage of his desire.  Of all the hunting-passions that burn in the breast\r\nof man, there is none that can lift him superior to discouragements like\r\nthese but the one--the royal sport, the supreme sport, whose quarry is\r\nhis brother.  By comparison, tiger-hunting is a colorless poor thing, for\r\nall it has been so bragged about.\r\n\r\nWhy, the Thug was content to tramp patiently along, afoot, in the wasting\r\nheat of India, week after week, at an average of nine or ten miles a day,\r\nif he might but hope to find game some time or other and refresh his\r\nlonging soul with blood.  Here is an instance:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI (Ramzam) and Hyder set out, for the purpose of strangling\r\n     travelers, from Guddapore, and proceeded via the Fort of Julalabad,\r\n     Newulgunge, Bangermow, on the banks of the Ganges (upwards of 100\r\n     miles), from whence we returned by another route.  Still no\r\n     travelers! till we reached Bowaneegunge, where we fell in with a\r\n     traveler, a boatman; we inveigled him and about two miles east of\r\n     there Hyder strangled him as he stood--for he was troubled and\r\n     afraid, and would not sit.  We then made a long journey (about 130\r\n     miles) and reached Hussunpore Bundwa, where at the tank we fell in\r\n     with a traveler--he slept there that night; next morning we followed\r\n     him and tried to win his confidence; at the distance of two miles we\r\n     endeavored to induce him to sit down--but he would not, having\r\n     become aware of us.  I attempted to strangle him as he walked along,\r\n     but did not succeed; both of us then fell upon him, he made a great\r\n     outcry, 'They are murdering me!' at length we strangled him and\r\n     flung his body into a well.  After this we returned to our homes,\r\n     having been out a month and traveled about 260 miles.  A total of\r\n     two men murdered on the expedition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here is another case-related by the terrible Futty Khan, a man with a\r\ntremendous record, to be re-mentioned by and by:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI, with three others, traveled for about 45 days a distance of\r\n     about 200 miles in search of victims along the highway to Bundwa and\r\n     returned by Davodpore (another 200 miles) during which journey we\r\n     had only one murder, which happened in this manner.  Four miles to\r\n     the east of Noubustaghat we fell in with a traveler, an old man.  I,\r\n     with Koshal and Hyder, inveigled him and accompanied him that day\r\n     within 3 miles of Rampoor, where, after dark, in a lonely place, we\r\n     got him to sit down and rest; and while I kept him in talk, seated\r\n     before him, Hyder behind strangled him: he made no resistance.\r\n     Koshal stabbed him under the arms and in the throat, and we flung\r\n     the body into a running stream.  We got about 4 or 5 rupees each ($2\r\n     or $2.50).  We then proceeded homewards.  A total of one man\r\n     murdered on this expedition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere.  They tramped 400 miles, were gone about three months, and\r\nharvested two dollars and a half apiece.  But the mere pleasure of the\r\nhunt was sufficient.  That was pay enough.  They did no grumbling.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then in this big book one comes across that pathetic\r\nremark: \xe2\x80\x9cwe tried to get him to sit down but he would not.\xe2\x80\x9d  It tells the\r\nwhole story.  Some accident had awakened the suspicion in him that these\r\nsmooth friends who had been petting and coddling him and making him feel\r\nso safe and so fortunate after his forlorn and lonely wanderings were the\r\ndreaded Thugs; and now their ghastly invitation to \xe2\x80\x9csit and rest\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nconfirmed its truth.  He knew there was no help for him, and that he was\r\nlooking his last upon earthly things, but \xe2\x80\x9che would not sit.\xe2\x80\x9d  No, not\r\nthat--it was too awful to think of!\r\n\r\nThere are a number of instances which indicate that when a man had once\r\ntasted the regal joys of man-hunting he could not be content with the\r\ndull monotony of a crimeless life after ward.  Example, from a Thug's\r\ntestimony:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWe passed through to Kurnaul, where we found a former Thug named\r\n     Junooa, an old comrade of ours, who had turned religious mendicant\r\n     and become a disciple and holy.  He came to us in the serai and\r\n     weeping with joy returned to his old trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNeither wealth nor honors nor dignities could satisfy a reformed Thug for\r\nlong.  He would throw them all away, someday, and go back to the lurid\r\npleasures of hunting men, and being hunted himself by the British.\r\n\r\nRamzam was taken into a great native grandee's service and given\r\nauthority over five villages.  \xe2\x80\x9cMy authority extended over these people\r\nto summons them to my presence, to make them stand or sit.  I dressed\r\nwell, rode my pony, and had two sepoys, a scribe and a village guard to\r\nattend me.  During three years I used to pay each village a monthly\r\nvisit, and no one suspected that I was a Thug!  The chief man used to\r\nwait on me to transact business, and as I passed along, old and young\r\nmade their salaam to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd yet during that very three years he got leave of absence \xe2\x80\x9cto attend a\r\nwedding,\xe2\x80\x9d and instead went off on a Thugging lark with six other Thugs\r\nand hunted the highway for fifteen days!--with satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he held a great office under a Rajah.  There he had ten miles\r\nof country under his command and a military guard of fifteen men, with\r\nauthority to call out 2,000 more upon occasion.  But the British got on\r\nhis track, and they crowded him so that he had to give himself up.  See\r\nwhat a figure he was when he was gotten up for style and had all his\r\nthings on: \xe2\x80\x9cI was fully armed--a sword, shield, pistols, a matchlock\r\nmusket and a flint gun, for I was fond of being thus arrayed, and when so\r\narmed feared not though forty men stood before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave himself up and proudly proclaimed himself a Thug.  Then by\r\nrequest he agreed to betray his friend and pal, Buhram, a Thug with the\r\nmost tremendous record in India.  \xe2\x80\x9cI went to the house where Buhram slept\r\n(often has he led our gangs!) I woke him, he knew me well, and came\r\noutside to me.  It was a cold night, so under pretence of warming myself,\r\nbut in reality to have light for his seizure by the guards, I lighted\r\nsome straw and made a blaze.  We were warming our hands.  The guards drew\r\naround us.  I said to them, 'This is Buhram,' and he was seized just as a\r\ncat seizes a mouse.  Then Buhram said, 'I am a Thug! my father was a\r\nThug, my grandfather was a Thug, and I have thugged with many!'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo spoke the mighty hunter, the mightiest of the mighty, the Gordon\r\nCumming of his day.  Not much regret noticeable in it.--[\xe2\x80\x9cHaving planted\r\na bullet in the shoulder-bone of an elephant, and caused the agonized\r\ncreature to lean for support against a tree, I proceeded to brew some\r\ncoffee.  Having refreshed myself, taking observations of the elephant's\r\nspasms and writhings between the sips, I resolved to make experiments on\r\nvulnerable points, and, approaching very near, I fired several bullets at\r\ndifferent parts of his enormous skull.  He only acknowledged the shots by\r\na salaam-like movement of his trunk, with the point of which he gently\r\ntouched the wounds with a striking and peculiar action.  Surprised and\r\nshocked to find that I was only prolonging the suffering of the noble\r\nbeast, which bore its trials with such dignified composure, I resolved to\r\nfinish the proceeding with all possible despatch, and accordingly opened\r\nfire upon him from the left side.  Aiming at the shoulder, I fired six\r\nshots with the two-grooved rifle, which must have eventually proved\r\nmortal, after which I fired six shots at the same part with the Dutch\r\nsix-founder.  Large tears now trickled down from his eyes, which he\r\nslowly shut and opened, his colossal frame shivered convulsively, and\r\nfalling on his side he expired.\xe2\x80\x9d--Gordon Cumming.]\r\n\r\nSo many many times this Official Report leaves one's curiosity\r\nunsatisfied.  For instance, here is a little paragraph out of the record\r\nof a certain band of 193 Thugs, which has that defect:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cFell in with Lall Sing Subahdar and his family, consisting of nine\r\n     persons.  Traveled with them two days, and the third put them all to\r\n     death except the two children, little boys of one and a half years\r\n     old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere it stops.  What did they do with those poor little fellows?  What\r\nwas their subsequent history?  Did they purpose training them up as\r\nThugs?  How could they take care of such little creatures on a march\r\nwhich stretched over several months?  No one seems to have cared to ask\r\nany questions about the babies.  But I do wish I knew.\r\n\r\nOne would be apt to imagine that the Thugs were utterly callous, utterly\r\ndestitute of human feelings, heartless toward their own families as well\r\nas toward other people's; but this was not so.  Like all other Indians,\r\nthey had a passionate love for their kin.  A shrewd British officer who\r\nknew the Indian character, took that characteristic into account in\r\nlaying his plans for the capture of Eugene Sue's famous Feringhea.  He\r\nfound out Feringhea's hiding-place, and sent a guard by night to seize\r\nhim, but the squad was awkward and he got away.  However, they got the\r\nrest of the family--the mother, wife, child, and brother--and brought\r\nthem to the officer, at Jubbulpore; the officer did not fret, but bided\r\nhis time: \xe2\x80\x9cI knew Feringhea would not go far while links so dear to him\r\nwere in my hands.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was right.  Feringhea knew all the danger he was\r\nrunning by staying in the neighborhood, still he could not tear himself\r\naway.  The officer found that he divided his time between five villages\r\nwhere he had relatives and friends who could get news for him from his\r\nfamily in Jubbulpore jail; and that he never slept two consecutive nights\r\nin the same village.  The officer traced out his several haunts, then\r\npounced upon all the five villages on the one night and at the same hour,\r\nand got his man.\r\n\r\nAnother example of family affection.  A little while previously to the\r\ncapture of Feringhea's family, the British officer had captured\r\nFeringhea's foster-brother, leader of a gang of ten, and had tried the\r\neleven and condemned them to be hanged.  Feringhea's captured family\r\narrived at the jail the day before the execution was to take place.  The\r\nfoster-brother, Jhurhoo, entreated to be allowed to see the aged mother\r\nand the others.  The prayer was granted, and this is what took place--it\r\nis the British officer who speaks:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning, just before going to the scaffold, the interview\r\n     took place before me.  He fell at the old woman's feet and begged\r\n     that she would relieve him from the obligations of the milk with\r\n     which she had nourished him from infancy, as he was about to die\r\n     before he could fulfill any of them.  She placed her hands on his\r\n     head, and he knelt, and she said she forgave him all, and bid him\r\n     die like a man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf a capable artist should make a picture of it, it would be full of\r\ndignity and solemnity and pathos; and it could touch you.  You would\r\nimagine it to be anything but what it was.  There is reverence there, and\r\ntenderness, and gratefulness, and compassion, and resignation, and\r\nfortitude, and self-respect--and no sense of disgrace, no thought of\r\ndishonor.  Everything is there that goes to make a noble parting, and\r\ngive it a moving grace and beauty and dignity.  And yet one of these\r\npeople is a Thug and the other a mother of Thugs!  The incongruities of\r\nour human nature seem to reach their limit here.\r\n\r\nI wish to make note of one curious thing while I think of it.  One of the\r\nvery commonest remarks to be found in this bewildering array of Thug\r\nconfessions is this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStrangled him and threw him in a well!\xe2\x80\x9d  In one case they threw sixteen\r\ninto a well--and they had thrown others in the same well before.  It\r\nmakes a body thirsty to read about it.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another very curious thing.  The bands of Thugs had private\r\ngraveyards.  They did not like to kill and bury at random, here and there\r\nand everywhere.  They preferred to wait, and toll the victims along, and\r\nget to one of their regular burying-places ['bheels') if they could.  In\r\nthe little kingdom of Oude, which was about half as big as Ireland and\r\nabout as big as the State of Maine, they had two hundred and seventy-four\r\n'bheels'.  They were scattered along fourteen hundred miles of road, at\r\nan average of only five miles apart, and the British government traced\r\nout and located each and every one of them and set them down on the map.\r\n\r\nThe Oude bands seldom went out of their own country, but they did a\r\nthriving business within its borders.  So did outside bands who came in\r\nand helped.  Some of the Thug leaders of Oude were noted for their\r\nsuccessful careers.  Each of four of them confessed to above 300 murders;\r\nanother to nearly 400; our friend Ramzam to 604--he is the one who got\r\nleave of absence to attend a wedding and went thugging instead; and he is\r\nalso the one who betrayed Buhram to the British.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest records of all were the murder-lists of Futty Khan and\r\nBuhram.  Futty Khan's number is smaller than Ramzam's, but he is placed\r\nat the head because his average is the best in Oude-Thug history per year\r\nof service.  His slaughter was 508 men in twenty years, and he was still\r\na young man when the British stopped his industry.  Buhram's list was 931\r\nmurders, but it took him forty years.  His average was one man and nearly\r\nall of another man per month for forty years, but Futty Khan's average\r\nwas two men and a little of another man per month during his twenty years\r\nof usefulness.\r\n\r\nThere is one very striking thing which I wish to call attention to.  You\r\nhave surmised from the listed callings followed by the victims of the\r\nThugs that nobody could travel the Indian roads unprotected and live to\r\nget through; that the Thugs respected no quality, no vocation, no\r\nreligion, nobody; that they killed every unarmed man that came in their\r\nway.  That is wholly true--with one reservation.  In all the long file of\r\nThug confessions an English traveler is mentioned but once--and this is\r\nwhat the Thug says of the circumstance:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHe was on his way from Mhow to Bombay.  We studiously avoided him.\r\n     He proceeded next morning with a number of travelers who had sought\r\n     his protection, and they took the road to Baroda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe do not know who he was; he flits across the page of this rusty old\r\nbook and disappears in the obscurity beyond; but he is an impressive\r\nfigure, moving through that valley of death serene and unafraid, clothed\r\nin the might of the English name.\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the big official book through, and we understand\r\nwhat Thuggee was, what a bloody terror it was, what a desolating scourge\r\nit was.  In 1830 the English found this cancerous organization imbedded\r\nin the vitals of the empire, doing its devastating work in secrecy, and\r\nassisted, protected, sheltered, and hidden by innumerable confederates\r\n--big and little native chiefs, customs officers, village officials, and\r\nnative police, all ready to lie for it, and the mass of the people,\r\nthrough fear, persistently pretending to know nothing about its doings;\r\nand this condition of things had existed for generations, and was\r\nformidable with the sanctions of age and old custom.  If ever there was\r\nan unpromising task, if ever there was a hopeless task in the world,\r\nsurely it was offered here--the task of conquering Thuggee.  But that\r\nlittle handful of English officials in India set their sturdy and\r\nconfident grip upon it, and ripped it out, root and branch!  How modest\r\ndo Captain Vallancey's words sound now, when we read them again, knowing\r\nwhat we know:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe day that sees this far-spread evil completely eradicated from\r\n     India, and known only in name, will greatly tend to immortalize\r\n     British rule in the East.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to word a claim more modestly than that for this most\r\nnoble work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nGrief can take care of itself; but to get the full value of a joy you\r\nmust have somebody to divide it with.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWe left Bombay for Allahabad by a night train.  It is the custom of the\r\ncountry to avoid day travel when it can conveniently be done.  But there\r\nis one trouble: while you can seemingly \xe2\x80\x9csecure\xe2\x80\x9d the two lower berths by\r\nmaking early application, there is no ticket as witness of it, and no\r\nother producible evidence in case your proprietorship shall chance to be\r\nchallenged.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cengaged\xe2\x80\x9d appears on the window, but it doesn't\r\nstate who the compartment is engaged, for.  If your Satan and your Barney\r\narrive before somebody else's servants, and spread the bedding on the two\r\nsofas and then stand guard till you come, all will be well; but if they\r\nstep aside on an errand, they may find the beds promoted to the two\r\nshelves, and somebody else's demons standing guard over their master's\r\nbeds, which in the meantime have been spread upon your sofas.\r\n\r\nYou do not pay anything extra for your sleeping place; that is where the\r\ntrouble lies.  If you buy a fare-ticket and fail to use it, there is room\r\nthus made available for someone else; but if the place were secured to\r\nyou it would remain vacant, and yet your ticket would secure you another\r\nplace when you were presently ready to travel.\r\n\r\nHowever, no explanation of such a system can make it seem quite rational\r\nto a person who has been used to a more rational system.  If our people\r\nhad the arranging of it, we should charge extra for securing the place,\r\nand then the road would suffer no loss if the purchaser did not occupy\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe present system encourages good manners--and also discourages them.\r\nIf a young girl has a lower berth and an elderly lady comes in, it is\r\nusual for the girl to offer her place to this late comer; and it is usual\r\nfor the late comer to thank her courteously and take it.  But the thing\r\nhappens differently sometimes.  When we were ready to leave Bombay my\r\ndaughter's satchels were holding possession of her berth--a lower one.\r\nAt the last moment, a middle-aged American lady swarmed into the\r\ncompartment, followed by native porters laden with her baggage.  She was\r\ngrowling and snarling and scolding, and trying to make herself\r\nphenomenally disagreeable; and succeeding.  Without a word, she hoisted\r\nthe satchels into the hanging shelf, and took possession of that lower\r\nberth.\r\n\r\nOn one of our trips Mr. Smythe and I got out at a station to walk up and\r\ndown, and when we came back Smythe's bed was in the hanging shelf and an\r\nEnglish cavalry officer was in bed on the sofa which he had lately been\r\noccupying.  It was mean to be glad about it, but it is the way we are\r\nmade; I could not have been gladder if it had been my enemy that had\r\nsuffered this misfortune.  We all like to see people in trouble, if it\r\ndoesn't cost us anything.  I was so happy over Mr. Smythe's chagrin that\r\nI couldn't go to sleep for thinking of it and enjoying it.  I knew he\r\nsupposed the officer had committed the robbery himself, whereas without a\r\ndoubt the officer's servant had done it without his knowledge.  Mr.\r\nSmythe kept this incident warm in his heart, and longed for a chance to\r\nget even with somebody for it.  Sometime afterward the opportunity came,\r\nin Calcutta.  We were leaving on a 24-hour journey to Darjeeling.  Mr.\r\nBarclay, the general superintendent, has made special provision for our\r\naccommodation, Mr. Smythe said; so there was no need to hurry about\r\ngetting to the train; consequently, we were a little late.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, the usual immense turmoil and confusion of a great\r\nIndian station were in full blast.  It was an immoderately long train,\r\nfor all the natives of India were going by it somewhither, and the native\r\nofficials were being pestered to frenzy by belated and anxious people.\r\nThey didn't know where our car was, and couldn't remember having received\r\nany orders about it.  It was a deep disappointment; moreover, it looked\r\nas if our half of our party would be left behind altogether.  Then Satan\r\ncame running and said he had found a compartment with one shelf and one\r\nsofa unoccupied, and had made our beds and had stowed our baggage.  We\r\nrushed to the place, and just as the train was ready to pull out and the\r\nporters were slamming the doors to, all down the line, an officer of the\r\nIndian Civil Service, a good friend of ours, put his head in and said:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been hunting for you everywhere.  What are you doing here?  Don't\r\nyou know----\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe train started before he could finish.  Mr. Smythe's opportunity was\r\ncome.  His bedding, on the shelf, at once changed places with the\r\nbedding--a stranger's--that was occupying the sofa that was opposite to\r\nmine.  About ten o'clock we stopped somewhere, and a large Englishman of\r\nofficial military bearing stepped in.  We pretended to be asleep.  The\r\nlamps were covered, but there was light enough for us to note his look of\r\nsurprise.  He stood there, grand and fine, peering down at Smythe, and\r\nwondering in silence at the situation.  After a bit he said:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d And that was all.\r\n\r\nBut that was enough.  It was easy to understand.  It meant: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nextraordinary.  This is high-handed.  I haven't had an experience like\r\nthis before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on his baggage, and for twenty minutes we watched him through\r\nour eyelashes, rocking and swaying there to the motion of the train.\r\nThen we came to a station, and he got up and went out, muttering: \xe2\x80\x9cI must\r\nfind a lower berth, or wait over.\xe2\x80\x9d His servant came presently and carried\r\naway his things.\r\n\r\nMr. Smythe's sore place was healed, his hunger for revenge was satisfied.\r\nBut he couldn't sleep, and neither could I; for this was a venerable old\r\ncar, and nothing about it was taut.  The closet door slammed all night,\r\nand defied every fastening we could invent.  We got up very much jaded,\r\nat dawn, and stepped out at a way station; and, while we were taking a\r\ncup of coffee, that Englishman ranged up alongside, and somebody said to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you didn't stop off, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.  The guard found a place for me that had been engaged and not\r\noccupied.  I had a whole saloon car all to myself--oh, quite palatial!\r\nI never had such luck in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was our car, you see.  We moved into it, straight off, the family\r\nand all.  But I asked the English gentleman to remain, and he did.  A\r\npleasant man, an infantry colonel; and doesn't know, yet, that Smythe\r\nrobbed him of his berth, but thinks it was done by Smythe's servant\r\nwithout Smythe's knowledge.  He was assisted in gathering this\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nThe Indian trains are manned by natives exclusively.  The Indian stations\r\nexcept very large and important ones--are manned entirely by natives, and\r\nso are the posts and telegraphs.  The rank and file of the police are\r\nnatives.  All these people are pleasant and accommodating.  One day I\r\nleft an express train to lounge about in that perennially ravishing show,\r\nthe ebb and flow and whirl of gaudy natives, that is always surging up\r\nand down the spacious platform of a great Indian station; and I lost\r\nmyself in the ecstasy of it, and when I turned, the train was moving\r\nswiftly away.  I was going to sit down and wait for another train, as I\r\nwould have done at home; I had no thought of any other course.  But a\r\nnative official, who had a green flag in his hand, saw me, and said\r\npolitely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon't you belong in the train, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\nHe waved his flag, and the train came back!  And he put me aboard with as\r\nmuch ceremony as if I had been the General Superintendent.  They are\r\nkindly people, the natives.  The face and the bearing that indicate a\r\nsurly spirit and a bad heart seemed to me to be so rare among Indians--so\r\nnearly non-existent, in fact--that I sometimes wondered if Thuggee wasn't\r\na dream, and not a reality.  The bad hearts are there, but I believe that\r\nthey are in a small, poor minority.  One thing is sure: They are much the\r\nmost interesting people in the world--and the nearest to being\r\nincomprehensible.  At any rate, the hardest to account for.  Their\r\ncharacter and their history, their customs and their religion, confront\r\nyou with riddles at every turn-riddles which are a trifle more perplexing\r\nafter they are explained than they were before.  You can get the facts of\r\na custom--like caste, and Suttee, and Thuggee, and so on--and with the\r\nfacts a theory which tries to explain, but never quite does it to your\r\nsatisfaction.  You can never quite understand how so strange a thing\r\ncould have been born, nor why.\r\n\r\nFor instance--the Suttee.  This is the explanation of it:\r\n\r\nA woman who throws away her life when her husband dies is instantly\r\njoined to him again, and is forever afterward happy with him in heaven;\r\nher family will build a little monument to her, or a temple, and will\r\nhold her in honor, and, indeed, worship her memory always; they will\r\nthemselves be held in honor by the public; the woman's self-sacrifice has\r\nconferred a noble and lasting distinction upon her posterity.  And,\r\nbesides, see what she has escaped: If she had elected to live, she would\r\nbe a disgraced person; she could not remarry; her family would despise\r\nher and disown her; she would be a friendless outcast, and miserable all\r\nher days.\r\n\r\nVery well, you say, but the explanation is not complete yet.  How did\r\npeople come to drift into such a strange custom?  What was the origin of\r\nthe idea?  \xe2\x80\x9cWell, nobody knows; it was probably a revelation sent down by\r\nthe gods.\xe2\x80\x9d  One more thing: Why was such a cruel death chosen--why\r\nwouldn't a gentle one have answered?  \xe2\x80\x9cNobody knows; maybe that was a\r\nrevelation, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo--you can never understand it.  It all seems impossible.  You resolve\r\nto believe that a widow never burnt herself willingly, but went to her\r\ndeath because she was afraid to defy public opinion.  But you are not\r\nable to keep that position.  History drives you from it.  Major Sleeman\r\nhas a convincing case in one of his books.  In his government on the\r\nNerbudda he made a brave attempt on the 28th of March, 1828, to put down\r\nSuttee on his own hook and without warrant from the Supreme Government of\r\nIndia.  He could not foresee that the Government would put it down itself\r\neight months later.  The only backing he had was a bold nature and a\r\ncompassionate heart.  He issued his proclamation abolishing the Suttee in\r\nhis district.  On the morning of Tuesday--note the day of the week--the\r\n24th of the following November, Ummed Singh Upadhya, head of the most\r\nrespectable and most extensive Brahmin family in the district, died, and\r\npresently came a deputation of his sons and grandsons to beg that his old\r\nwidow might be allowed to burn herself upon his pyre.  Sleeman threatened\r\nto enforce his order, and punish severely any man who assisted; and he\r\nplaced a police guard to see that no one did so.  From the early morning\r\nthe old widow of sixty-five had been sitting on the bank of the sacred\r\nriver by her dead, waiting through the long hours for the permission; and\r\nat last the refusal came instead.  In one little sentence Sleeman gives\r\nyou a pathetic picture of this lonely old gray figure: all day and all\r\nnight \xe2\x80\x9cshe remained sitting by the edge of the water without eating or\r\ndrinking.\xe2\x80\x9d  The next morning the body of the husband was burned to ashes\r\nin a pit eight feet square and three or four feet deep, in the view of\r\nseveral thousand spectators.  Then the widow waded out to a bare rock in\r\nthe river, and everybody went away but her sons and other relations.  All\r\nday she sat there on her rock in the blazing sun without food or drink,\r\nand with no clothing but a sheet over her shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe relatives remained with her and all tried to persuade her to desist\r\nfrom her purpose, for they deeply loved her.  She steadily refused.  Then\r\na part of the family went to Sleeman's house, ten miles away, and tried\r\nagain to get him to let her burn herself.  He refused, hoping to save her\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nAll that day she scorched in her sheet on the rock, and all that night\r\nshe kept her vigil there in the bitter cold.  Thursday morning, in the\r\nsight of her relatives, she went through a ceremonial which said more to\r\nthem than any words could have done; she put on the dhaja (a coarse red\r\nturban) and broke her bracelets in pieces.  By these acts she became a\r\ndead person in the eye of the law, and excluded from her caste forever.\r\nBy the iron rule of ancient custom, if she should now choose to live she\r\ncould never return to her family.  Sleeman was in deep trouble.  If she\r\nstarved herself to death her family would be disgraced; and, moreover,\r\nstarving would be a more lingering misery than the death by fire.  He\r\nwent back in the evening thoroughly worried.  The old woman remained on\r\nher rock, and there in the morning he found her with her dhaja still on\r\nher head.  \xe2\x80\x9cShe talked very collectedly, telling me that she had\r\ndetermined to mix her ashes with those of her departed husband, and\r\nshould patiently wait my permission to do so, assured that God would\r\nenable her to sustain life till that was given, though she dared not eat\r\nor drink.  Looking at the sun, then rising before her over a long and\r\nbeautiful reach of the river, she said calmly, 'My soul has been for five\r\ndays with my husband's near that sun; nothing but my earthly frame is\r\nleft; and this, I know, you will in time suffer to be mixed with his\r\nashes in yonder pit, because it is not in your nature or usage wantonly\r\nto prolong the miseries of a poor old woman.'\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe assured her that it was his desire and duty to save her, and to urge\r\nher to live, and to keep her family from the disgrace of being thought\r\nher murderers.  But she said she \xe2\x80\x9cwas not afraid of their being thought\r\nso; that they had all, like good children, done everything in their power\r\nto induce her to live, and to abide with them;  and if I should consent I\r\nknow they would love and honor me, but my duties to them have now ended.\r\nI commit them all to your care, and I go to attend my husband, Ummed\r\nSingh Upadhya, with whose ashes on the funeral pile mine have been\r\nalready three times mixed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe believed that she and he had been upon the earth three several times\r\nas wife and husband, and that she had burned herself to death three times\r\nupon his pyre.  That is why she said that strange thing.  Since she had\r\nbroken her bracelets and put on the red turban she regarded herself as a\r\ncorpse; otherwise she would not have allowed herself to do her husband\r\nthe irreverence of pronouncing his name.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis was the first time in her\r\nlong life that she had ever uttered her husband's name, for in India no\r\nwoman, high or low, ever pronounces the name of her husband.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMajor Sleeman still tried to shake her purpose.  He promised to build her\r\na fine house among the temples of her ancestors upon the bank of the\r\nriver and make handsome provision for her out of rent-free lands if she\r\nwould consent to live; and if she wouldn't he would allow no stone or\r\nbrick to ever mark the place where she died.  But she only smiled and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cMy pulse has long ceased to beat, my spirit has departed; I shall\r\nsuffer nothing in the burning; and if you wish proof, order some fire and\r\nyou shall see this arm consumed without giving me any pain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSleeman was now satisfied that he could not alter her purpose.  He sent\r\nfor all the chief members of the family and said he would suffer her to\r\nburn herself if they would enter into a written engagement to abandon the\r\nsuttee in their family thenceforth.  They agreed; the papers were drawn\r\nout and signed, and at noon, Saturday, word was sent to the poor old\r\nwoman.  She seemed greatly pleased.  The ceremonies of bathing were gone\r\nthrough with, and by three o'clock she was ready and the fire was briskly\r\nburning in the pit.  She had now gone without food or drink during more\r\nthan four days and a half.  She came ashore from her rock, first wetting\r\nher sheet in the waters of the sacred river, for without that safeguard\r\nany shadow which might fall upon her would convey impurity to her; then\r\nshe walked to the pit, leaning upon one of her sons and a nephew--the\r\ndistance was a hundred and fifty yards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had sentries placed all around, and no other person was allowed to\r\napproach within five paces.  She came on with a calm and cheerful\r\ncountenance, stopped once, and casting her eyes upwards, said, 'Why have\r\nthey kept me five days from thee, my husband?'  On coming to the sentries\r\nher supporters stopped and remained standing; she moved on, and walked\r\nonce around the pit, paused a moment, and while muttering a prayer, threw\r\nsome flowers into the fire.  She then walked up deliberately and steadily\r\nto the brink, stepped into the centre of the flame, sat down, and leaning\r\nback in the midst as if reposing upon a couch, was consumed without\r\nuttering a shriek or betraying one sign of agony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is fine and beautiful.  It compels one's reverence and respect--no,\r\nhas it freely, and without compulsion.  We see how the custom, once\r\nstarted, could continue, for the soul of it is that stupendous power,\r\nFaith; faith brought to the pitch of effectiveness by the cumulative\r\nforce of example and long use and custom; but we cannot understand how\r\nthe first widows came to take to it.  That is a perplexing detail.\r\n\r\nSleeman says that it was usual to play music at the suttee, but that the\r\nwhite man's notion that this was to drown the screams of the martyr is\r\nnot correct; that it had a quite different purpose.  It was believed that\r\nthe martyr died prophecying; that the prophecies sometimes foretold\r\ndisaster, and it was considered a kindness to those upon whom it was to\r\nfall to drown the voice and keep them in ignorance of the misfortune that\r\nwas to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nHe had had much experience of physicians, and said \xe2\x80\x9cthe only way to keep\r\nyour health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like,\r\nand do what you'd druther not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n                                   --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nIt was a long journey--two nights, one day, and part of another day, from\r\nBombay eastward to Allahabad; but it was always interesting, and it was\r\nnot fatiguing.  At first the night travel promised to be fatiguing, but\r\nthat was on account of pyjamas.  This foolish night-dress consists of\r\njacket and drawers.  Sometimes they are made of silk, sometimes of a\r\nraspy, scratchy, slazy woolen material with a sandpaper surface.  The\r\ndrawers are loose elephant-legged and elephant-waisted things, and\r\ninstead of buttoning around the body there is a drawstring to produce the\r\nrequired shrinkage.  The jacket is roomy, and one buttons it in front.\r\nPyjamas are hot on a hot night and cold on a cold night--defects which a\r\nnightshirt is free from.  I tried the pyjamas in order to be in the\r\nfashion; but I was obliged to give them up, I couldn't stand them.  There\r\nwas no sufficient change from day-gear to night-gear.  I missed the\r\nrefreshing and luxurious sense, induced by the night-gown, of being\r\nundressed, emancipated, set free from restraints and trammels.  In place\r\nof that, I had the worried, confined, oppressed, suffocated sense of\r\nbeing abed with my clothes on.  All through the warm half of the night\r\nthe coarse surfaces irritated my skin and made it feel baked and\r\nfeverish, and the dreams which came in the fitful flurries of slumber\r\nwere such as distress the sleep of the damned, or ought to; and all\r\nthrough the cold other half of the night I could get no time for sleep\r\nbecause I had to employ it all in stealing blankets.  But blankets are of\r\nno value at such a time; the higher they are piled the more effectively\r\nthey cork the cold in and keep it from getting out.  The result is that\r\nyour legs are ice, and you know how you will feel by and by when you are\r\nburied.  In a sane interval I discarded the pyjamas, and led a rational\r\nand comfortable life thenceforth.\r\n\r\nOut in the country in India, the day begins early.  One sees a plain,\r\nperfectly flat, dust-colored and brick-yardy, stretching limitlessly away\r\non every side in the dim gray light, striped everywhere with hard-beaten\r\nnarrow paths, the vast flatness broken at wide intervals by bunches of\r\nspectral trees that mark where villages are; and along all the paths are\r\nslender women and the black forms of lanky naked men moving, to their\r\nwork, the women with brass water-jars on their heads, the men carrying\r\nhoes.  The man is not entirely naked; always there is a bit of white rag,\r\na loin-cloth; it amounts to a bandage, and is a white accent on his black\r\nperson, like the silver band around the middle of a pipe-stem.  Sometimes\r\nhe also wears a fluffy and voluminous white turban, and this adds a\r\nsecond accent.  He then answers properly to Miss Gordon Cumming's\r\nflash-light picture of him--as a person who is dressed in \xe2\x80\x9ca turban\r\nand a pocket handkerchief.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll day long one has this monotony of dust-colored dead levels and\r\nscattering bunches of trees and mud villages.  You soon realize that\r\nIndia is not beautiful; still there is an enchantment about it that is\r\nbeguiling, and which does not pall.  You cannot tell just what it is that\r\nmakes the spell, perhaps, but you feel it and confess it, nevertheless.\r\nOf course, at bottom, you know in a vague way that it is history; it is\r\nthat that affects you, a haunting sense of the myriads of human lives\r\nthat have blossomed, and withered, and perished here, repeating and\r\nrepeating and repeating, century after century, and age after age, the\r\nbarren and meaningless process; it is this sense that gives to this\r\nforlorn, uncomely land power to speak to the spirit and make friends with\r\nit; to speak to it with a voice bitter with satire, but eloquent with\r\nmelancholy.  The deserts of Australia and the ice-barrens of Greenland\r\nhave no speech, for they have no venerable history; with nothing to tell\r\nof man and his vanities, his fleeting glories and his miseries, they have\r\nnothing wherewith to spiritualize their ugliness and veil it with a\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing pretty about an Indian village--a mud one--and I do not\r\nremember that we saw any but mud ones on that long flight to Allahabad.\r\nIt is a little bunch of dirt-colored mud hovels jammed together within a\r\nmud wall.  As a rule, the rains had beaten down parts of some of the\r\nhouses, and this gave the village the aspect of a mouldering and hoary\r\nruin.  I believe the cattle and the vermin live inside the wall; for I\r\nsaw cattle coming out and cattle going in; and whenever I saw a villager,\r\nhe was scratching.  This last is only circumstantial evidence, but I\r\nthink it has value.  The village has a battered little temple or two, big\r\nenough to hold an idol, and with custom enough to fat-up a priest and\r\nkeep him comfortable.  Where there are Mohammedans there are generally a\r\nfew sorry tombs outside the village that have a decayed and neglected\r\nlook.  The villages interested me because of things which Major Sleeman\r\nsays about them in his books--particularly what he says about the\r\ndivision of labor in them.  He says that the whole face of India is\r\nparceled out into estates of villages; that nine-tenths of the vast\r\npopulation of the land consist of cultivators of the soil; that it is\r\nthese cultivators who inhabit the villages; that there are certain\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d village servants--mechanics and others who are apparently\r\npaid a wage by the village at large, and whose callings remain in certain\r\nfamilies and are handed down from father to son, like an estate.  He\r\ngives a list of these established servants: Priest, blacksmith,\r\ncarpenter, accountant, washerman, basketmaker, potter, watchman, barber,\r\nshoemaker, brazier, confectioner, weaver, dyer, etc.  In his day witches\r\nabounded, and it was not thought good business wisdom for a man to marry\r\nhis daughter into a family that hadn't a witch in it, for she would need\r\na witch on the premises to protect her children from the evil spells\r\nwhich would certainly be cast upon them by the witches connected with the\r\nneighboring families.\r\n\r\nThe office of midwife was hereditary in the family of the basket-maker.\r\nIt belonged to his wife.  She might not be competent, but the office was\r\nhers, anyway.  Her pay was not high--25 cents for a boy, and half as much\r\nfor a girl.  The girl was not desired, because she would be a disastrous\r\nexpense by and by.  As soon as she should be old enough to begin to wear\r\nclothes for propriety's sake, it would be a disgrace to the family if she\r\nwere not married; and to marry her meant financial ruin; for by custom\r\nthe father must spend upon feasting and wedding-display everything he had\r\nand all he could borrow--in fact, reduce himself to a condition of\r\npoverty which he might never more recover from.\r\n\r\nIt was the dread of this prospective ruin which made the killing of\r\ngirl-babies so prevalent in India in the old days before England laid the\r\niron hand of her prohibitions upon the piteous slaughter.  One may judge\r\nof how prevalent the custom was, by one of Sleeman's casual electrical\r\nremarks, when he speaks of children at play in villages--where\r\ngirl-voices were never heard!\r\n\r\nThe wedding-display folly is still in full force in India, and by\r\nconsequence the destruction of girl-babies is still furtively practiced;\r\nbut not largely, because of the vigilance of the government and the\r\nsternness of the penalties it levies.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of India the village keeps in its pay three other servants:\r\nan astrologer to tell the villager when he may plant his crop, or make a\r\njourney, or marry a wife, or strangle a child, or borrow a dog, or climb\r\na tree, or catch a rat, or swindle a neighbor, without offending the\r\nalert and solicitous heavens; and what his dream means, if he has had one\r\nand was not bright enough to interpret it himself by the details of his\r\ndinner; the two other established servants were the tiger-persuader and\r\nthe hailstorm discourager.  The one kept away the tigers if he could, and\r\ncollected the wages anyway, and the other kept off the hailstorms, or\r\nexplained why he failed.  He charged the same for explaining a failure\r\nthat he did for scoring a success.  A man is an idiot who can't earn a\r\nliving in India.\r\n\r\nMajor Sleeman reveals the fact that the trade union and the boycott are\r\nantiquities in India.  India seems to have originated everything.  The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csweeper\xe2\x80\x9d belongs to the bottom caste; he is the lowest of the low--all\r\nother castes despise him and scorn his office.  But that does not trouble\r\nhim.  His caste is a caste, and that is sufficient for him, and so he is\r\nproud of it, not ashamed.  Sleeman says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt is perhaps not known to many of my countrymen, even in India,\r\n     that in every town and city in the country the right of sweeping the\r\n     houses and streets is a monopoly, and is supported entirely by the\r\n     pride of castes among the scavengers, who are all of the lowest\r\n     class.  The right of sweeping within a certain range is recognized\r\n     by the caste to belong to a certain member; and if any other member\r\n     presumes to sweep within that range, he is excommunicated--no other\r\n     member will smoke out of his pipe or drink out of his jug; and he\r\n     can get restored to caste only by a feast to the whole body of\r\n     sweepers.  If any housekeeper within a particular circle happens to\r\n     offend the sweeper of that range, none of his filth will be removed\r\n     till he pacifies him, because no other sweeper will dare to touch\r\n     it; and the people of a town are often more tyrannized over by these\r\n     people than by any other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA footnote by Major Sleeman's editor, Mr. Vincent Arthur Smith, says that\r\nin our day this tyranny of the sweepers' guild is one of the many\r\ndifficulties which bar the progress of Indian sanitary reform.  Think of\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe sweepers cannot be readily coerced, because no Hindoo or\r\n     Mussulman would do their work to save his life, nor will he pollute\r\n     himself by beating the refractory scavenger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey certainly do seem to have the whip-hand; it would be difficult to\r\nimagine a more impregnable position.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe vested rights described in the\r\ntext are so fully recognized in practice that they are frequently the\r\nsubject of sale or mortgage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust like a milk-route; or like a London crossing-sweepership.  It is\r\nsaid that the London crossing-sweeper's right to his crossing is\r\nrecognized by the rest of the guild; that they protect him in its\r\npossession; that certain choice crossings are valuable property, and are\r\nsaleable at high figures.  I have noticed that the man who sweeps in\r\nfront of the Army and Navy Stores has a wealthy South African\r\naristocratic style about him; and when he is off his guard, he has\r\nexactly that look on his face which you always see in the face of a man\r\nwho is saving up his daughter to marry her to a duke.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Sleeman that in India the occupation of elephant-driver\r\nis confined to Mohammedans.  I wonder why that is.  The water-carrier\r\n['bheestie') is a Mohammedan, but it is said that the reason of that is,\r\nthat the Hindoo's religion does not allow him to touch the skin of dead\r\nkine, and that is what the water-sack is made of; it would defile him.\r\nAnd it doesn't allow him to eat meat; the animal that furnished the meat\r\nwas murdered, and to take any creature's life is a sin.  It is a good and\r\ngentle religion, but inconvenient.\r\n\r\nA great Indian river, at low water, suggests the familiar anatomical\r\npicture of a skinned human body, the intricate mesh of interwoven muscles\r\nand tendons to stand for water-channels, and the archipelagoes of fat and\r\nflesh inclosed by them to stand for the sandbars.  Somewhere on this\r\njourney we passed such a river, and on a later journey we saw in the\r\nSutlej the duplicate of that river.  Curious rivers they are; low shores\r\na dizzy distance apart, with nothing between but an enormous acreage of\r\nsand-flats with sluggish little veins of water dribbling around amongst\r\nthem; Saharas of sand, smallpox-pitted with footprints punctured in belts\r\nas straight as the equator clear from the one shore to the other (barring\r\nthe channel-interruptions)--a dry-shod ferry, you see.  Long railway\r\nbridges are required for this sort of rivers, and India has them.  You\r\napproach Allahabad by a very long one.  It was now carrying us across the\r\nbed of the Jumna, a bed which did not seem to have been slept in for one\r\nwhile or more.  It wasn't all river-bed--most of it was overflow ground.\r\n\r\nAllahabad means \xe2\x80\x9cCity of God.\xe2\x80\x9d I get this from the books.  From a printed\r\ncuriosity--a letter written by one of those brave and confident Hindoo\r\nstrugglers with the English tongue, called a \xe2\x80\x9cbabu\xe2\x80\x9d--I got a more\r\ncompressed translation: \xe2\x80\x9cGodville.\xe2\x80\x9d It is perfectly correct, but that is\r\nthe most that can be said for it.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in the forenoon, and short-handed; for Satan got left behind\r\nsomewhere that morning, and did not overtake us until after nightfall.\r\nIt seemed very peaceful without him.  The world seemed asleep and\r\ndreaming.\r\n\r\nI did not see the native town, I think.  I do not remember why; for an\r\nincident connects it with the Great Mutiny, and that is enough to make\r\nany place interesting.  But I saw the English part of the city.  It is a\r\ntown of wide avenues and noble distances, and is comely and alluring, and\r\nfull of suggestions of comfort and leisure, and of the serenity which a\r\ngood conscience buttressed by a sufficient bank account gives.  The\r\nbungalows (dwellings) stand well back in the seclusion and privacy of\r\nlarge enclosed compounds (private grounds, as we should say) and in the\r\nshade and shelter of trees.  Even the photographer and the prosperous\r\nmerchant ply their industries in the elegant reserve of big compounds,\r\nand the citizens drive in there upon their business occasions.  And not\r\nin\r\ncabs--no; in the Indian cities cabs are for the drifting stranger; all\r\nthe white citizens have private carriages; and each carriage has a flock\r\nof white-turbaned black footmen and drivers all over it.  The vicinity of\r\na lecture-hall looks like a snowstorm,--and makes the lecturer feel like\r\nan opera.  India has many names, and they are correctly descriptive.  It\r\nis the Land of Contradictions, the Land of Subtlety and Superstition, the\r\nLand of Wealth and Poverty, the Land of Splendor and Desolation, the Land\r\nof Plague and Famine, the Land of the Thug and the Poisoner, and of the\r\nMeek and the Patient, the Land of the Suttee, the Land of the\r\nUnreinstatable Widow, the Land where All Life is Holy, the Land of\r\nCremation, the Land where the Vulture is a Grave and a Monument, the Land\r\nof the Multitudinous Gods; and if signs go for anything, it is the Land\r\nof the Private Carriage.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay the forewoman of a millinery shop came to the hotel in her\r\nprivate carriage to take the measure for a gown--not for me, but for\r\nanother.  She had come out to India to make a temporary stay, but was\r\nextending it indefinitely; indeed, she was purposing to end her days\r\nthere.  In London, she said, her work had been hard, her hours long; for\r\neconomy's sake she had had to live in shabby rooms and far away from the\r\nshop, watch the pennies, deny herself many of the common comforts of\r\nlife, restrict herself in effect to its bare necessities, eschew cabs,\r\ntravel third-class by underground train to and from her work, swallowing\r\ncoal-smoke and cinders all the way, and sometimes troubled with the\r\nsociety of men and women who were less desirable than the smoke and the\r\ncinders.  But in Bombay, on almost any kind of wages, she could live in\r\ncomfort, and keep her carriage, and have six servants in place of the\r\nwoman-of-all-work she had had in her English home.  Later, in Calcutta, I\r\nfound that the Standard Oil clerks had small one-horse vehicles, and did\r\nno walking; and I was told that the clerks of the other large concerns\r\nthere had the like equipment.  But to return to Allahabad.\r\n\r\nI was up at dawn, the next morning.  In India the tourist's servant does\r\nnot sleep in a room in the hotel, but rolls himself up head and ears in\r\nhis blanket and stretches himself on the veranda, across the front of his\r\nmaster's door, and spends the night there.  I don't believe anybody's\r\nservant occupies a room.  Apparently, the bungalow servants sleep on the\r\nveranda; it is roomy, and goes all around the house.  I speak of\r\nmenservants; I saw none of the other sex.  I think there are none, except\r\nchild-nurses.  I was up at dawn, and walked around the veranda, past the\r\nrows of sleepers.  In front of one door a Hindoo servant was squatting,\r\nwaiting for his master to call him.  He had polished the yellow shoes and\r\nplaced them by the door, and now he had nothing to do but wait.  It was\r\nfreezing cold, but there he was, as motionless as a sculptured image, and\r\nas patient.  It troubled me.  I wanted to say to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDon't crouch there\r\nlike that and freeze; nobody requires it of you; stir around and get\r\nwarm.\xe2\x80\x9d  But I hadn't the words.  I thought of saying 'jeldy jow', but I\r\ncouldn't remember what it meant, so I didn't say it.  I knew another\r\nphrase, but it wouldn't come to my mind.  I moved on, purposing to\r\ndismiss him from my thoughts, but his bare legs and bare feet kept him\r\nthere.  They kept drawing me back from the sunny side to a point whence I\r\ncould see him.  At the end of an hour he had not changed his attitude in\r\nthe least degree.  It was a curious and impressive exhibition of meekness\r\nand patience, or fortitude or indifference, I did not know which.  But it\r\nworried me, and it was spoiling my morning.  In fact, it spoiled two\r\nhours of it quite thoroughly.  I quitted this vicinity, then, and left\r\nhim to punish himself as much as he might want to.  But up to that time\r\nthe man had not changed his attitude a hair.  He will always remain with\r\nme, I suppose; his figure never grows vague in my memory.  Whenever I\r\nread of Indian resignation, Indian patience under wrongs, hardships, and\r\nmisfortunes, he comes before me.  He becomes a personification, and\r\nstands for India in trouble.  And for untold ages India in trouble has\r\nbeen pursued with the very remark which I was going to utter but didn't,\r\nbecause its meaning had slipped me: \xe2\x80\x9cJeldy jow!\xe2\x80\x9d  (\xe2\x80\x9cCome, shove along!\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nWhy, it was the very thing.\r\n\r\nIn the early brightness we made a long drive out to the Fort.  Part of\r\nthe way was beautiful.  It led under stately trees and through groups of\r\nnative houses and by the usual village well, where the picturesque gangs\r\nare always flocking to and fro and laughing and chattering; and this time\r\nbrawny men were deluging their bronze bodies with the limpid water, and\r\nmaking a refreshing and enticing show of it; enticing, for the sun was\r\nalready transacting business, firing India up for the day.  There was\r\nplenty of this early bathing going on, for it was getting toward\r\nbreakfast time, and with an unpurified body the Hindoo must not eat.\r\n\r\nThen we struck into the hot plain, and found the roads crowded with\r\npilgrims of both sexes, for one of the great religious fairs of India was\r\nbeing held, just beyond the Fort, at the junction of the sacred rivers,\r\nthe Ganges and the Jumna.  Three sacred rivers, I should have said, for\r\nthere is a subterranean one.  Nobody has seen it, but that doesn't\r\nsignify.  The fact that it is there is enough.  These pilgrims had come\r\nfrom all over India; some of them had been months on the way, plodding\r\npatiently along in the heat and dust, worn, poor, hungry, but supported\r\nand sustained by an unwavering faith and belief; they were supremely\r\nhappy and content, now; their full and sufficient reward was at hand;\r\nthey were going to be cleansed from every vestige of sin and corruption\r\nby these holy waters which make utterly pure whatsoever thing they touch,\r\neven the dead and rotten.  It is wonderful, the power of a faith like\r\nthat, that can make multitudes upon multitudes of the old and weak and\r\nthe young and frail enter without hesitation or complaint upon such\r\nincredible journeys and endure the resultant miseries without repining.\r\nIt is done in love, or it is done in fear; I do not know which it is.\r\nNo matter what the impulse is, the act born of it is beyond imagination\r\nmarvelous to our kind of people, the cold whites.  There are choice great\r\nnatures among us that could exhibit the equivalent of this prodigious\r\nself-sacrifice, but the rest of us know that we should not be equal to\r\nanything approaching it.  Still, we all talk self-sacrifice, and this\r\nmakes me hope that we are large enough to honor it in the Hindoo.\r\n\r\nTwo millions of natives arrive at this fair every year.  How many start,\r\nand die on the road, from age and fatigue and disease and scanty\r\nnourishment, and how many die on the return, from the same causes, no one\r\nknows; but the tale is great, one may say enormous.  Every twelfth year\r\nis held to be a year of peculiar grace; a greatly augmented volume of\r\npilgrims results then.  The twelfth year has held this distinction since\r\nthe remotest times, it is said.  It is said also that there is to be but\r\none more twelfth year--for the Ganges.  After that, that holiest of all\r\nsacred rivers will cease to be holy, and will be abandoned by the pilgrim\r\nfor many centuries; how many, the wise men have not stated.  At the end\r\nof that interval it will become holy again.  Meantime, the data will be\r\narranged by those people who have charge of all such matters, the great\r\nchief Brahmins.  It will be like shutting down a mint.  At a first glance\r\nit looks most unbrahminically uncommercial, but I am not disturbed, being\r\nsoothed and tranquilized by their reputation.  \xe2\x80\x9cBrer fox he lay low,\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nUncle Remus says; and at the judicious time he will spring something on\r\nthe Indian public which will show that he was not financially asleep when\r\nhe took the Ganges out of the market.\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of the natives along the roads were bringing away holy\r\nwater from the rivers.  They would carry it far and wide in India and\r\nsell it.  Tavernier, the French traveler (17th century), notes that\r\nGanges water is often given at weddings, \xe2\x80\x9ceach guest receiving a cup or\r\ntwo, according to the liberality of the host; sometimes 2,000 or 3,000\r\nrupees' worth of it is consumed at a wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Fort is a huge old structure, and has had a large experience in\r\nreligions.  In its great court stands a monolith which was placed there\r\nmore than 2,000 years ago to preach (Budhism) by its pious inscription;\r\nthe Fort was built three centuries ago by a Mohammedan Emperor--a\r\nresanctification of the place in the interest of that religion.  There is\r\na Hindoo temple, too, with subterranean ramifications stocked with\r\nshrines and idols; and now the Fort belongs to the English, it contains a\r\nChristian Church.  Insured in all the companies.\r\n\r\nFrom the lofty ramparts one has a fine view of the sacred rivers.  They\r\njoin at that point--the pale blue Jumna, apparently clean and clear, and\r\nthe muddy Ganges, dull yellow and not clean.  On a long curved spit\r\nbetween the rivers, towns of tents were visible, with a multitude of\r\nfluttering pennons, and a mighty swarm of pilgrims.  It was a troublesome\r\nplace to get down to, and not a quiet place when you arrived; but it was\r\ninteresting.  There was a world of activity and turmoil and noise, partly\r\nreligious, partly commercial; for the Mohammedans were there to curse and\r\nsell, and the Hindoos to buy and pray.  It is a fair as well as a\r\nreligious festival.  Crowds were bathing, praying, and drinking the\r\npurifying waters, and many sick pilgrims had come long journeys in\r\npalanquins to be healed of their maladies by a bath; or if that might not\r\nbe, then to die on the blessed banks and so make sure of heaven.  There\r\nwere fakeers in plenty, with their bodies dusted over with ashes and\r\ntheir long hair caked together with cow-dung; for the cow is holy and so\r\nis the rest of it; so holy that the good Hindoo peasant frescoes the\r\nwalls of his hut with this refuse, and also constructs ornamental figures\r\nout of it for the gracing of his dirt floor.  There were seated families,\r\nfearfully and wonderfully painted, who by attitude and grouping\r\nrepresented the families of certain great gods.  There was a holy man who\r\nsat naked by the day and by the week on a cluster of iron spikes, and did\r\nnot seem to mind it; and another holy man, who stood all day holding his\r\nwithered arms motionless aloft, and was said to have been doing it for\r\nyears.  All of these performers have a cloth on the ground beside them\r\nfor the reception of contributions, and even the poorest of the people\r\ngive a trifle and hope that the sacrifice will be blessed to him.  At\r\nlast came a procession of naked holy people marching by and chanting, and\r\nI wrenched myself away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nThe man who is ostentatious of his modesty is twin to the statue that\r\nwears a fig-leaf.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Benares was all in daylight, and occupied but a few hours.\r\nIt was admirably dusty.  The dust settled upon you in a thick ashy layer\r\nand turned you into a fakeer, with nothing lacking to the role but the\r\ncow manure and the sense of holiness.  There was a change of cars about\r\nmid-afternoon at Moghul-serai--if that was the name--and a wait of two\r\nhours there for the Benares train.  We could have found a carriage and\r\ndriven to the sacred city, but we should have lost the wait.  In other\r\ncountries a long wait at a station is a dull thing and tedious, but one\r\nhas no right to have that feeling in India.  You have the monster crowd\r\nof bejeweled natives, the stir, the bustle, the confusion, the shifting\r\nsplendors of the costumes--dear me, the delight of it, the charm of it\r\nare beyond speech.  The two-hour wait was over too soon.  Among other\r\nsatisfying things to look at was a minor native prince from the backwoods\r\nsomewhere, with his guard of honor, a ragged but wonderfully gaudy gang\r\nof fifty dark barbarians armed with rusty flint-lock muskets.  The\r\ngeneral show came so near to exhausting variety that one would have said\r\nthat no addition to it could be conspicuous, but when this Falstaff and\r\nhis motleys marched through it one saw that that seeming impossibility\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nWe got away by and by, and soon reached the outer edge of Benares; then\r\nthere was another wait; but, as usual, with something to look at.  This\r\nwas a cluster of little canvas-boxes--palanquins.  A canvas-box is not\r\nmuch of a sight--when empty; but when there is a lady in it, it is an\r\nobject of interest.  These boxes were grouped apart, in the full blaze of\r\nthe terrible sun during the three-quarters of an hour that we tarried\r\nthere. They contained zenana ladies.  They had to sit up; there was not\r\nroom enough to stretch out.  They probably did not mind it.  They are\r\nused to the close captivity of their dwellings all their lives; when they\r\ngo a journey they are carried to the train in these boxes; in the train\r\nthey have to be secluded from inspection.  Many people pity them, and I\r\nalways did it myself and never charged anything; but it is doubtful if\r\nthis compassion is valued.  While we were in India some good-hearted\r\nEuropeans in one of the cities proposed to restrict a large park to the\r\nuse of zenana ladies, so that they could go there and in assured privacy\r\ngo about unveiled and enjoy the sunshine and air as they had never\r\nenjoyed them before.  The good intentions back of the proposition were\r\nrecognized, and sincere thanks returned for it, but the proposition\r\nitself met with a prompt declination at the hands of those who were\r\nauthorized to speak for the zenana ladies.  Apparently, the idea was\r\nshocking to the ladies--indeed, it was quite manifestly shocking.  Was\r\nthat proposition the equivalent of inviting European ladies to assemble\r\nscantily and scandalously clothed in the seclusion of a private park?  It\r\nseemed to be about that.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt modesty is nothing less than a holy feeling; and without\r\ndoubt the person whose rule of modesty has been transgressed feels the\r\nsame sort of wound that he would feel if something made holy to him by\r\nhis religion had suffered a desecration.  I say \xe2\x80\x9crule of modesty\xe2\x80\x9d because\r\nthere are about a million rules in the world, and this makes a million\r\nstandards to be looked out for.  Major Sleeman mentions the case of some\r\nhigh-caste veiled ladies who were profoundly scandalized when some\r\nEnglish young ladies passed by with faces bare to the world; so\r\nscandalized that they spoke out with strong indignation and wondered that\r\npeople could be so shameless as to expose their persons like that.  And\r\nyet \xe2\x80\x9cthe legs of the objectors were naked to mid-thigh.\xe2\x80\x9d  Both parties\r\nwere clean-minded and irreproachably modest, while abiding by their\r\nseparate rules, but they couldn't have traded rules for a change without\r\nsuffering considerable discomfort.  All human rules are more or less\r\nidiotic, I suppose.  It is best so, no doubt.  The way it is now, the\r\nasylums can hold the sane people, but if we tried to shut up the insane\r\nwe should run out of building materials.\r\n\r\nYou have a long drive through the outskirts of Benares before you get to\r\nthe hotel.  And all the aspects are melancholy.  It is a vision of dusty\r\nsterility, decaying temples, crumbling tombs, broken mud walls, shabby\r\nhuts.  The whole region seems to ache with age and penury.  It must take\r\nten thousand years of want to produce such an aspect.  We were still\r\noutside of the great native city when we reached the hotel.  It was a\r\nquiet and homelike house, inviting, and manifestly comfortable.  But we\r\nliked its annex better, and went thither.  It was a mile away, perhaps,\r\nand stood in the midst of a large compound, and was built bungalow\r\nfashion, everything on the ground floor, and a veranda all around.  They\r\nhave doors in India, but I don't know why.  They don't fasten, and they\r\nstand open, as a rule, with a curtain hanging in the doorspace to keep\r\nout the glare of the sun.  Still, there is plenty of privacy, for no\r\nwhite person will come in without notice, of course.  The native men\r\nservants will, but they don't seem to count.  They glide in, barefoot and\r\nnoiseless, and are in the midst before one knows it.  At first this is a\r\nshock, and sometimes it is an embarrassment; but one has to get used to\r\nit, and does.\r\n\r\nThere was one tree in the compound, and a monkey lived in it.  At first I\r\nwas strongly interested in the tree, for I was told that it was the\r\nrenowned peepul--the tree in whose shadow you cannot tell a lie.  This\r\none failed to stand the test, and I went away from it disappointed.\r\nThere was a softly creaking well close by, and a couple of oxen drew\r\nwater from it by the hour, superintended by two natives dressed in the\r\nusual \xe2\x80\x9cturban and pocket-handkerchief.\xe2\x80\x9d  The tree and the well were the\r\nonly scenery, and so the compound was a soothing and lonesome and\r\nsatisfying place; and very restful after so many activities.  There was\r\nnobody in our bungalow but ourselves; the other guests were in the next\r\none, where the table d'hote was furnished.  A body could not be more\r\npleasantly situated.  Each room had the customary bath attached--a room\r\nten or twelve feet square, with a roomy stone-paved pit in it and\r\nabundance of water.  One could not easily improve upon this arrangement,\r\nexcept by furnishing it with cold water and excluding the hot, in\r\ndeference to the fervency of the climate; but that is forbidden.  It\r\nwould damage the bather's health.  The stranger is warned against taking\r\ncold baths in India, but even the most intelligent strangers are fools,\r\nand they do not obey, and so they presently get laid up.  I was the most\r\nintelligent fool that passed through, that year.  But I am still more\r\nintelligent now.  Now that it is too late.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the 'dorian', if that is the name of it, is another\r\nsuperstition, like the peepul tree.  There was a great abundance and\r\nvariety of tropical fruits, but the dorian was never in evidence.  It was\r\nnever the season for the dorian.  It was always going to arrive from\r\nBurma sometime or other, but it never did.  By all accounts it was a most\r\nstrange fruit, and incomparably delicious to the taste, but not to the\r\nsmell.  Its rind was said to exude a stench of so atrocious a nature that\r\nwhen a dorian was in the room even the presence of a polecat was a\r\nrefreshment.  We found many who had eaten the dorian, and they all spoke\r\nof it with a sort of rapture.  They said that if you could hold your nose\r\nuntil the fruit was in your mouth a sacred joy would suffuse you from\r\nhead to foot that would make you oblivious to the smell of the rind, but\r\nthat if your grip slipped and you caught the smell of the rind before the\r\nfruit was in your mouth, you would faint.  There is a fortune in that\r\nrind.  Some day somebody will import it into Europe and sell it for\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nBenares was not a disappointment.  It justified its reputation as a\r\ncuriosity.  It is on high ground, and overhangs a grand curve of the\r\nGanges.  It is a vast mass of building, compactly crusting a hill, and is\r\ncloven in all directions by an intricate confusion of cracks which stand\r\nfor streets.  Tall, slim minarets and beflagged temple-spires rise out of\r\nit and give it picturesqueness, viewed from the river.  The city is as\r\nbusy as an ant-hill, and the hurly-burly of human life swarming along the\r\nweb of narrow streets reminds one of the ants.  The sacred cow swarms\r\nalong, too, and goes whither she pleases, and takes toll of the\r\ngrain-shops, and is very much in the way, and is a good deal of a\r\nnuisance, since she must not be molested.\r\n\r\nBenares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than\r\nlegend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together.  From a\r\nHindoo statement quoted in Rev. Mr. Parker's compact and lucid Guide to\r\nBenares, I find that the site of the town was the beginning-place of the\r\nCreation.  It was merely an upright \xe2\x80\x9clingam,\xe2\x80\x9d at first, no larger than a\r\nstove-pipe, and stood in the midst of a shoreless ocean.  This was the\r\nwork of the God Vishnu.  Later he spread the lingam out till its surface\r\nwas ten miles across.  Still it was not large enough for the business;\r\ntherefore he presently built the globe around it.  Benares is thus the\r\ncenter of the earth.  This is considered an advantage.\r\n\r\nIt has had a tumultuous history, both materially and spiritually.  It\r\nstarted Brahminically, many ages ago; then by and by Buddha came in\r\nrecent times 2,500 years ago, and after that it was Buddhist during many\r\ncenturies--twelve, perhaps--but the Brahmins got the upper hand again,\r\nthen, and have held it ever since.  It is unspeakably sacred in Hindoo\r\neyes, and is as unsanitary as it is sacred, and smells like the rind of\r\nthe dorian.  It is the headquarters of the Brahmin faith, and one-eighth\r\nof the population are priests of that church.  But it is not an\r\noverstock, for they have all India as a prey.  All India flocks thither\r\non pilgrimage, and pours its savings into the pockets of the priests in a\r\ngenerous stream, which never fails.  A priest with a good stand on the\r\nshore of the Ganges is much better off than the sweeper of the best\r\ncrossing in London.  A good stand is worth a world of money.  The holy\r\nproprietor of it sits under his grand spectacular umbrella and blesses\r\npeople all his life, and collects his commission, and grows fat and rich;\r\nand the stand passes from father to son, down and down and down through\r\nthe ages, and remains a permanent and lucrative estate in the family.  As\r\nMr. Parker suggests, it can become a subject of dispute, at one time or\r\nanother, and then the matter will be settled, not by prayer and fasting\r\nand consultations with Vishnu, but by the intervention of a much more\r\npuissant power--an English court.  In Bombay I was told by an American\r\nmissionary that in India there are 640 Protestant missionaries at work.\r\nAt first it seemed an immense force, but of course that was a thoughtless\r\nidea.  One missionary to 500,000 natives--no, that is not a force; it is\r\nthe reverse of it; 640 marching against an intrenched camp of\r\n300,000,000--the odds are too great.  A force of 640 in Benares alone\r\nwould have its hands over-full with 8,000 Brahmin priests for adversary.\r\nMissionaries need to be well equipped with hope and confidence, and this\r\nequipment they seem to have always had in all parts of the world.  Mr.\r\nParker has it.  It enables him to get a favorable outlook out of\r\nstatistics which might add up differently with other mathematicians.  For\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the past few years competent observers declare that the number of\r\npilgrims to Benares has increased.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then he adds up this fact and gets this conclusion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the revival, if so it may be called, has in it the marks of death.\r\nIt is a spasmodic struggle before dissolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this world we have seen the Roman Catholic power dying, upon these\r\nsame terms, for many centuries.  Many a time we have gotten all ready for\r\nthe funeral and found it postponed again, on account of the weather or\r\nsomething.  Taught by experience, we ought not to put on our things for\r\nthis Brahminical one till we see the procession move.  Apparently one of\r\nthe most uncertain things in the world is the funeral of a religion.\r\n\r\nI should have been glad to acquire some sort of idea of Hindoo theology,\r\nbut the difficulties were too great, the matter was too intricate.  Even\r\nthe mere A, B, C of it is baffling.\r\n\r\nThere is a trinity--Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu--independent powers,\r\napparently, though one cannot feel quite sure of that, because in one of\r\nthe temples there is an image where an attempt has been made to\r\nconcentrate the three in one person.  The three have other names and\r\nplenty of them, and this makes confusion in one's mind.  The three have\r\nwives and the wives have several names, and this increases the confusion.\r\nThere are children, the children have many names, and thus the confusion\r\ngoes on and on.  It is not worth while to try to get any grip upon the\r\ncloud of minor gods, there are too many of them.\r\n\r\nIt is even a justifiable economy to leave Brahma, the chiefest god of\r\nall, out of your studies, for he seems to cut no great figure in India.\r\nThe vast bulk of the national worship is lavished upon Shiva and Vishnu\r\nand their families.  Shiva's symbol--the \xe2\x80\x9clingam\xe2\x80\x9d with which Vishnu began\r\nthe Creation--is worshiped by everybody, apparently.  It is the commonest\r\nobject in Benares.  It is on view everywhere, it is garlanded with\r\nflowers, offerings are made to it, it suffers no neglect.  Commonly it is\r\nan upright stone, shaped like a thimble--sometimes like an elongated\r\nthimble.  This priapus-worship, then, is older than history.  Mr. Parker\r\nsays that the lingams in Benares \xe2\x80\x9coutnumber the inhabitants.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn Benares there are many Mohammedan mosques.  There are Hindoo temples\r\nwithout number--these quaintly shaped and elaborately sculptured little\r\nstone jugs crowd all the lanes.  The Ganges itself and every individual\r\ndrop of water in it are temples.  Religion, then, is the business of\r\nBenares, just as gold-production is the business of Johannesburg.  Other\r\nindustries count for nothing as compared with the vast and all-absorbing\r\nrush and drive and boom of the town's specialty.  Benares is the\r\nsacredest of sacred cities.  The moment you step across the\r\nsharply-defined line which separates it from the rest of the globe, you\r\nstand upon ineffably and unspeakably holy ground.  Mr. Parker says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nis impossible to convey any adequate idea of the intense feelings of\r\nveneration and affection with which the pious Hindoo regards 'Holy Kashi'\r\n(Benares).\xe2\x80\x9d And then he gives you this vivid and moving picture:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cLet a Hindoo regiment be marched through the district, and as soon\r\n     as they cross the line and enter the limits of the holy place they\r\n     rend the air with cries of 'Kashi ji ki jai--jai!  (Holy\r\n     Kashi!  Hail to thee!  Hail!  Hail!  Hail)'.  The weary pilgrim\r\n     scarcely able to stand, with age and weakness, blinded by the dust\r\n     and heat, and almost dead with fatigue, crawls out of the oven-like\r\n     railway carriage and as soon as his feet touch the ground he lifts\r\n     up his withered hands and utters the same pious exclamation.  Let a\r\n     European in some distant city in casual talk in the bazar mention\r\n     the fact that he has lived at Benares, and at once voices will be\r\n     raised to call down blessings on his head, for a dweller in Benares\r\n     is of all men most blessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt makes our own religious enthusiasm seem pale and cold.  Inasmuch as\r\nthe life of religion is in the heart, not the head, Mr. Parker's touching\r\npicture seems to promise a sort of indefinite postponement of that\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nLet me make the superstitions of a nation and I care not who makes its\r\nlaws or its songs either.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nYes, the city of Benares is in effect just a big church, a religious\r\nhive, whose every cell is a temple, a shrine or a mosque, and whose every\r\nconceivable earthly and heavenly good is procurable under one roof, so to\r\nspeak--a sort of Army and Navy Stores, theologically stocked.\r\n\r\nI will make out a little itinerary for the pilgrim; then you will see how\r\nhandy the system is, how convenient, how comprehensive.  If you go to\r\nBenares with a serious desire to spiritually benefit yourself, you will\r\nfind it valuable.  I got some of the facts from conversations with the\r\nRev. Mr. Parker and the others from his Guide to Benares; they are\r\ntherefore trustworthy.\r\n\r\n1. Purification.  At sunrise you must go down to the Ganges and bathe,\r\npray, and drink some of the water.  This is for your general\r\npurification.\r\n\r\n2. Protection against Hunger.  Next, you must fortify yourself against\r\nthe sorrowful earthly ill just named.  This you will do by worshiping for\r\na moment in the Cow Temple.  By the door of it you will find an image of\r\nGanesh, son of Shiva; it has the head of an elephant on a human body; its\r\nface and hands are of silver.  You will worship it a little, and pass on,\r\ninto a covered veranda, where you will find devotees reciting from the\r\nsacred books, with the help of instructors.  In this place are groups of\r\nrude and dismal idols.  You may contribute something for their support;\r\nthen pass into the temple, a grim and stenchy place, for it is populous\r\nwith sacred cows and with beggars.  You will give something to the\r\nbeggars, and \xe2\x80\x9creverently kiss the tails\xe2\x80\x9d of such cows as pass along, for\r\nthese cows are peculiarly holy, and this act of worship will secure you\r\nfrom hunger for the day.\r\n\r\n3. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Poor Man's Friend.\xe2\x80\x9d  You will next worship this god.  He is at\r\nthe bottom of a stone cistern in the temple of Dalbhyeswar, under the\r\nshade of a noble peepul tree on the bluff overlooking the Ganges, so you\r\nmust go back to the river.  The Poor Man's Friend is the god of material\r\nprosperity in general, and the god of the rain in particular.  You will\r\nsecure material prosperity, or both, by worshiping him.  He is Shiva,\r\nunder a new alias, and he abides in the bottom of that cistern, in the\r\nform of a stone lingam.  You pour Ganges water over him, and in return\r\nfor this homage you get the promised benefits.  If there is any delay\r\nabout the rain, you must pour water in until the cistern is full; the\r\nrain will then be sure to come.\r\n\r\n4. Fever.  At the Kedar Ghat you will find a long flight of stone steps\r\nleading down to the river.  Half way down is a tank filled with sewage.\r\nDrink as much of it as you want.  It is for fever.\r\n\r\n5. Smallpox.  Go straight from there to the central Ghat.  At its\r\nupstream end you will find a small whitewashed building, which is a\r\ntemple sacred to Sitala, goddess of smallpox.  Her under-study is there\r\n--a rude human figure behind a brass screen.  You will worship this for\r\nreasons to be furnished presently.\r\n\r\n6. The Well of Fate.  For certain reasons you will next go and do homage\r\nat this well.  You will find it in the Dandpan Temple, in the city.  The\r\nsunlight falls into it from a square hole in the masonry above.  You will\r\napproach it with awe, for your life is now at stake.  You will bend over\r\nand look.  If the fates are propitious, you will see your face pictured\r\nin the water far down in the well.  If matters have been otherwise\r\nordered, a sudden cloud will mask the sun and you will see nothing.  This\r\nmeans that you have not six months to live.  If you are already at the\r\npoint of death, your circumstances are now serious.  There is no time to\r\nlose.  Let this world go, arrange for the next one.  Handily situated, at\r\nyour very elbow, is opportunity for this.  You turn and worship the image\r\nof Maha Kal, the Great Fate, and happiness in the life to come is\r\nsecured.  If there is breath in your body yet, you should now make an\r\neffort to get a further lease of the present life.  You have a chance.\r\nThere is a chance for everything in this admirably stocked and\r\nwonderfully systemized Spiritual and Temporal Army and Navy Store.  You\r\nmust get yourself carried to the\r\n\r\n7. Well of Long Life.  This is within the precincts of the mouldering and\r\nvenerable Briddhkal Temple, which is one of the oldest in Benares.  You\r\npass in by a stone image of the monkey god, Hanuman, and there, among the\r\nruined courtyards, you will find a shallow pool of stagnant sewage.  It\r\nsmells like the best limburger cheese, and is filthy with the washings of\r\nrotting lepers, but that is nothing, bathe in it; bathe in it gratefully\r\nand worshipfully, for this is the Fountain of Youth; these are the Waters\r\nof Long Life.  Your gray hairs will disappear, and with them your\r\nwrinkles and your rheumatism, the burdens of care and the weariness of\r\nage, and you will come out young, fresh, elastic, and full of eagerness\r\nfor the new race of life.  Now will come flooding upon you the manifold\r\ndesires that haunt the dear dreams of the morning of life.  You will go\r\nwhither you will find\r\n\r\n8. Fulfillment of Desire.  To wit, to the Kameshwar Temple, sacred to\r\nShiva as the Lord of Desires.  Arrange for yours there.  And if you like\r\nto look at idols among the pack and jam of temples, there you will find\r\nenough to stock a museum.  You will begin to commit sins now with a\r\nfresh, new vivacity; therefore, it will be well to go frequently to a\r\nplace where you can get\r\n\r\n9. Temporary Cleansing from Sin.  To wit, to the Well of the Earring.\r\nYou must approach this with the profoundest reverence, for it is\r\nunutterably sacred.  It is, indeed, the most sacred place in Benares, the\r\nvery Holy of Holies, in the estimation of the people.  It is a railed\r\ntank, with stone stairways leading down to the water.  The water is not\r\nclean.  Of course it could not be, for people are always bathing in it.\r\nAs long as you choose to stand and look, you will see the files of\r\nsinners descending and ascending--descending soiled with sin, ascending\r\npurged from it.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe liar, the thief, the murderer, and the adulterer\r\nmay here wash and be clean,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Rev. Mr. Parker, in his book.  Very\r\nwell.  I know Mr. Parker, and I believe it; but if anybody else had said\r\nit, I should consider him a person who had better go down in the tank and\r\ntake another wash.  The god Vishnu dug this tank.  He had nothing to dig\r\nwith but his \xe2\x80\x9cdiscus.\xe2\x80\x9d I do not know what a discus is, but I know it is a\r\npoor thing to dig tanks with, because, by the time this one was finished,\r\nit was full of sweat--Vishnu's sweat.  He constructed the site that\r\nBenares stands on, and afterward built the globe around it, and thought\r\nnothing of it, yet sweated like that over a little thing like this tank.\r\nOne of these statements is doubtful.  I do not know which one it is, but\r\nI think it difficult not to believe that a god who could build a world\r\naround Benares would not be intelligent enough to build it around the\r\ntank too, and not have to dig it.  Youth, long life, temporary\r\npurification from sin, salvation through propitiation of the Great Fate\r\n--these are all good.  But you must do something more.  You must\r\n\r\n10. Make Salvation Sure.  There are several ways.  To get drowned in\r\nthe Ganges is one, but that is not pleasant.  To die within the limits of\r\nBenares is another; but that is a risky one, because you might be out of\r\ntown when your time came.  The best one of all is the Pilgrimage Around\r\nthe City.  You must walk; also, you must go barefoot.  The tramp is\r\nforty-four miles, for the road winds out into the country a piece, and\r\nyou will be marching five or six days.  But you will have plenty of\r\ncompany.  You will move with throngs and hosts of happy pilgrims whose\r\nradiant costumes will make the spectacle beautiful and whose glad songs\r\nand holy pans of triumph will banish your fatigues and cheer your spirit;\r\nand at intervals there will be temples where you may sleep and be\r\nrefreshed with food.  The pilgrimage completed, you have purchased\r\nsalvation, and paid for it.  But you may not get it unless you\r\n\r\n11. Get Your Redemption Recorded.  You can get this done at the Sakhi\r\nBinayak Temple, and it is best to do it, for otherwise you might not be\r\nable to prove that you had made the pilgrimage in case the matter should\r\nsome day come to be disputed.  That temple is in a lane back of the Cow\r\nTemple.  Over the door is a red image of Ganesh of the elephant head, son\r\nand heir of Shiva, and Prince of Wales to the Theological Monarchy, so to\r\nspeak.  Within is a god whose office it is to record your pilgrimage and\r\nbe responsible for you.  You will not see him, but you will see a Brahmin\r\nwho will attend to the matter and take the money.  If he should forget to\r\ncollect the money, you can remind him.  HE  knows that your salvation is\r\nnow secure, but of course you would like to know it yourself.  You have\r\nnothing to do but go and pray, and pay at the\r\n\r\n12.  Well of the Knowledge of Salvation.  It is close to the Golden\r\nTemple.  There you will see, sculptured out of a single piece of black\r\nmarble, a bull which is much larger than any living bull you have ever\r\nseen, and yet is not a good likeness after all.  And there also you will\r\nsee a very uncommon thing--an image of Shiva.  You have seen his lingam\r\nfifty thousand times already, but this is Shiva himself, and said to be a\r\ngood likeness.  It has three eyes.  He is the only god in the firm that\r\nhas three.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe well is covered by a fine canopy of stone supported by\r\nforty pillars,\xe2\x80\x9d and around it you will find what you have already seen at\r\nalmost every shrine you have visited in Benares, a mob of devout and\r\neager pilgrims.  The sacred water is being ladled out to them; with it\r\ncomes to them the knowledge, clear, thrilling, absolute, that they are\r\nsaved; and you can see by their faces that there is one happiness in this\r\nworld which is supreme, and to which no other joy is comparable.  You\r\nreceive your water, you make your deposit, and now what more would you\r\nhave?  Gold, diamonds, power, fame?  All in a single moment these things\r\nhave withered to dirt, dust, ashes.  The world has nothing to give you\r\nnow.  For you it is bankrupt.\r\n\r\nI do not claim that the pilgrims do their acts of worship in the order\r\nand sequence above charted out in this Itinerary of mine, but I think\r\nlogic suggests that they ought to do so.  Instead of a helter-skelter\r\nworship, we then have a definite starting-place, and a march which\r\ncarries the pilgrim steadily forward by reasoned and logical progression\r\nto a definite goal.  Thus, his Ganges bath in the early morning gives him\r\nan appetite; he kisses the cow-tails, and that removes it.  It is now\r\nbusiness hours, and longings for material prosperity rise in his mind,\r\nand he goes and pours water over Shiva's symbol; this insures the\r\nprosperity, but also brings on a rain, which gives him a fever.  Then he\r\ndrinks the sewage at the Kedar Ghat to cure the fever; it cures the fever\r\nbut gives him the smallpox.  He wishes to know how it is going to turn\r\nout; he goes to the Dandpan Temple and looks down the well.  A clouded\r\nsun shows him that death is near.  Logically his best course for the\r\npresent, since he cannot tell at what moment he may die, is to secure a\r\nhappy hereafter; this he does, through the agency of the Great Fate.  He\r\nis safe, now, for heaven; his next move will naturally be to keep out of\r\nit as long as he can.  Therefore he goes to the Briddhkal Temple and\r\nsecures Youth and long life by bathing in a puddle of leper-pus which\r\nwould kill a microbe.  Logically, Youth has re-equipped him for sin and\r\nwith the disposition to commit it; he will naturally go to the fane which\r\nis consecrated to the Fulfillment of Desires, and make arrangements.\r\nLogically, he will now go to the Well of the Earring from time to time to\r\nunload and freshen up for further banned enjoyments.  But first and last\r\nand all the time he is human, and therefore in his reflective intervals\r\nhe will always be speculating in \xe2\x80\x9cfutures.\xe2\x80\x9d  He will make the Great\r\nPilgrimage around the city and so make his salvation absolutely sure; he\r\nwill also have record made of it, so that it may remain absolutely sure\r\nand not be forgotten or repudiated in the confusion of the Final\r\nSettlement.  Logically, also, he will wish to have satisfying and\r\ntranquilizing personal knowledge that that salvation is secure; therefore\r\nhe goes to the Well of the Knowledge of Salvation, adds that completing\r\ndetail, and then goes about his affairs serene and content; serene and\r\ncontent, for he is now royally endowed with an advantage which no\r\nreligion in this world could give him but his own; for henceforth he may\r\ncommit as many million sins as he wants to and nothing can come of it.\r\n\r\nThus the system, properly and logically ordered, is neat, compact,\r\nclearly defined, and covers the whole ground.  I desire to recommend it\r\nto such as find the other systems too difficult, exacting, and irksome\r\nfor the uses of this fretful brief life of ours.\r\n\r\nHowever, let me not deceive any one.  My Itinerary lacks a detail.  I\r\nmust put it in.  The truth is, that after the pilgrim has faithfully\r\nfollowed the requirements of the Itinerary through to the end and has\r\nsecured his salvation and also the personal knowledge of that fact, there\r\nis still an accident possible to him which can annul the whole thing.  If\r\nhe should ever cross to the other side of the Ganges and get caught out\r\nand die there he would at once come to life again in the form of an ass.\r\nThink of that, after all this trouble and expense.  You see how\r\ncapricious and uncertain salvation is there.  The Hindoo has a childish\r\nand unreasoning aversion to being turned into an ass.  It is hard to tell\r\nwhy.  One could properly expect an ass to have an aversion to being\r\nturned into a Hindoo.  One could understand that he could lose dignity by\r\nit; also self-respect, and nine-tenths of his intelligence.  But the\r\nHindoo changed into an ass wouldn't lose anything, unless you count his\r\nreligion.  And he would gain much--release from his slavery to two\r\nmillion gods and twenty million priests, fakeers, holy mendicants, and\r\nother sacred bacilli; he would escape the Hindoo hell; he would also\r\nescape the Hindoo heaven.  These are advantages which the Hindoo ought to\r\nconsider; then he would go over and die on the other side.\r\n\r\nBenares is a religious Vesuvius.  In its bowels the theological forces\r\nhave been heaving and tossing, rumbling, thundering and quaking, boiling,\r\nand weltering and flaming and smoking for ages.  But a little group of\r\nmissionaries have taken post at its base, and they have hopes.  There are\r\nthe Baptist Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society, the London\r\nMissionary Society, the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and the Zenana Bible\r\nand Medical Mission.  They have schools, and the principal work seems to\r\nbe among the children.  And no doubt that part of the work prospers best,\r\nfor grown people everywhere are always likely to cling to the religion\r\nthey were brought up in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nWrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nIn one of those Benares temples we saw a devotee working for salvation in\r\na curious way.  He had a huge wad of clay beside him and was making it up\r\ninto little wee gods no bigger than carpet tacks.  He stuck a grain of\r\nrice into each--to represent the lingam, I think.  He turned them out\r\nnimbly, for he had had long practice and had acquired great facility.\r\nEvery day he made 2,000 gods, then threw them into the holy Ganges.  This\r\nact of homage brought him the profound homage of the pious--also their\r\ncoppers.  He had a sure living here, and was earning a high place in the\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThe Ganges front is the supreme show-place of Benares.  Its tall bluffs\r\nare solidly caked from water to summit, along a stretch of three miles,\r\nwith a splendid jumble of massive and picturesque masonry, a bewildering\r\nand beautiful confusion of stone platforms, temples, stair-flights, rich\r\nand stately palaces--nowhere a break, nowhere a glimpse of the bluff\r\nitself; all the long face of it is compactly walled from sight by this\r\ncrammed perspective of platforms, soaring stairways, sculptured temples,\r\nmajestic palaces, softening away into the distances; and there is\r\nmovement, motion, human life everywhere, and brilliantly costumed\r\n--streaming in rainbows up and down the lofty stairways, and massed in\r\nmetaphorical flower-gardens on the miles of great platforms at the\r\nriver's edge.\r\n\r\nAll this masonry, all this architecture represents piety.  The palaces\r\nwere built by native princes whose homes, as a rule, are far from\r\nBenares, but who go there from time to time to refresh their souls with\r\nthe sight and touch of the Ganges, the river of their idolatry.  The\r\nstairways are records of acts of piety; the crowd of costly little\r\ntemples are tokens of money spent by rich men for present credit and hope\r\nof future reward.  Apparently, the rich Christian who spends large sums\r\nupon his religion is conspicuous with us, by his rarity, but the rich\r\nHindoo who doesn't spend large sums upon his religion is seemingly\r\nnon-existent.  With us the poor spend money on their religion, but they\r\nkeep back some to live on.  Apparently, in India, the poor bankrupt\r\nthemselves daily for their religion.  The rich Hindoo can afford his\r\npious outlays; he gets much glory for his spendings, yet keeps back a\r\nsufficiency of his income for temporal purposes; but the poor Hindoo is\r\nentitled to compassion, for his spendings keep him poor, yet get him no\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nWe made the usual trip up and down the river, seated in chairs under an\r\nawning on the deck of the usual commodious hand-propelled ark; made it\r\ntwo or three times, and could have made it with increasing interest and\r\nenjoyment many times more; for, of course, the palaces and temples would\r\ngrow more and more beautiful every time one saw them, for that happens\r\nwith all such things; also, I think one would not get tired of the\r\nbathers, nor their costumes, nor of their ingenuities in getting out of\r\nthem and into them again without exposing too much bronze, nor of their\r\ndevotional gesticulations and absorbed bead-tellings.\r\n\r\nBut I should get tired of seeing them wash their mouths with that\r\ndreadful water and drink it.  In fact, I did get tired of it, and very\r\nearly, too.  At one place where we halted for a while, the foul gush from\r\na sewer was making the water turbid and murky all around, and there was a\r\nrandom corpse slopping around in it that had floated down from up\r\ncountry.  Ten steps below that place stood a crowd of men, women, and\r\ncomely young maidens waist deep in the water-and they were scooping it up\r\nin their hands and drinking it.  Faith can certainly do wonders, and this\r\nis an instance of it.  Those people were not drinking that fearful stuff\r\nto assuage thirst, but in order to purify their souls and the interior of\r\ntheir bodies.  According to their creed, the Ganges water makes\r\neverything pure that it touches--instantly and utterly pure.  The sewer\r\nwater was not an offence to them, the corpse did not revolt them; the\r\nsacred water had touched both, and both were now snow-pure, and could\r\ndefile no one.  The memory of that sight will always stay by me; but not\r\nby request.\r\n\r\nA word further concerning the nasty but all-purifying Ganges water.  When\r\nwe went to Agra, by and by, we happened there just in time to be in at\r\nthe birth of a marvel--a memorable scientific discovery--the discovery\r\nthat in certain ways the foul and derided Ganges water is the most\r\npuissant purifier in the world!  This curious fact, as I have said, had\r\njust been added to the treasury of modern science.  It had long been\r\nnoted as a strange thing that while Benares is often afflicted with the\r\ncholera she does not spread it beyond her borders.  This could not be\r\naccounted for.  Mr. Henkin, the scientist in the employ of the government\r\nof Agra, concluded to examine the water.  He went to Benares and made his\r\ntests.  He got water at the mouths of the sewers where they empty into\r\nthe river at the bathing ghats; a cubic centimetre of it contained\r\nmillions of germs; at the end of six hours they were all dead.  He caught\r\na floating corpse, towed it to the shore, and from beside it he dipped up\r\nwater that was swarming with cholera germs; at the end of six hours they\r\nwere all dead.  He added swarm after swarm of cholera germs to this\r\nwater; within the six hours they always died, to the last sample.\r\nRepeatedly, he took pure well water which was barren of animal life, and\r\nput into it a few cholera germs; they always began to propagate at once,\r\nand always within six hours they swarmed--and were numberable by millions\r\nupon millions.\r\n\r\nFor ages and ages the Hindoos have had absolute faith that the water of\r\nthe Ganges was absolutely pure, could not be defiled by any contact\r\nwhatsoever, and infallibly made pure and clean whatsoever thing touched\r\nit.  They still believe it, and that is why they bathe in it and drink\r\nit, caring nothing for its seeming filthiness and the floating corpses.\r\nThe Hindoos have been laughed at, these many generations, but the\r\nlaughter will need to modify itself a little from now on.  How did\r\nthey find out the water's secret in those ancient ages?  Had they\r\ngerm-scientists then?  We do not know.  We only know that they had a\r\ncivilization long before we emerged from savagery.  But to return to\r\nwhere I was before; I was about to speak of the burning-ghat.\r\n\r\nThey do not burn fakeers--those revered mendicants.  They are so holy\r\nthat they can get to their place without that sacrament, provided they be\r\nconsigned to the consecrating river.  We saw one carried to mid-stream\r\nand thrown overboard.  He was sandwiched between two great slabs of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nWe lay off the cremation-ghat half an hour and saw nine corpses burned.\r\nI should not wish to see any more of it, unless I might select the\r\nparties.  The mourners follow the bier through the town and down to the\r\nghat; then the bier-bearers deliver the body to some low-caste natives\r\n--Doms--and the mourners turn about and go back home.  I heard no crying\r\nand saw no tears, there was no ceremony of parting.  Apparently, these\r\nexpressions of grief and affection are reserved for the privacy of the\r\nhome.  The dead women came draped in red, the men in white.  They are\r\nlaid in the water at the river's edge while the pyre is being prepared.\r\n\r\nThe first subject was a man.  When the Doms unswathed him to wash him, he\r\nproved to be a sturdily built, well-nourished and handsome old gentleman,\r\nwith not a sign about him to suggest that he had ever been ill.  Dry wood\r\nwas brought and built up into a loose pile; the corpse was laid upon it\r\nand covered over with fuel.  Then a naked holy man who was sitting on\r\nhigh ground a little distance away began to talk and shout with great\r\nenergy, and he kept up this noise right along.  It may have been the\r\nfuneral sermon, and probably was.  I forgot to say that one of the\r\nmourners remained behind when the others went away.  This was the dead\r\nman's son, a boy of ten or twelve, brown and handsome, grave and\r\nself-possessed, and clothed in flowing white.  He was there to burn his\r\nfather.  He was given a torch, and while he slowly walked seven times\r\naround the pyre the naked black man on the high ground poured out his\r\nsermon more clamorously than ever.  The seventh circuit completed, the\r\nboy applied the torch at his father's head, then at his feet; the flames\r\nsprang briskly up with a sharp crackling noise, and the lad went away.\r\nHindoos do not want daughters, because their weddings make such a ruinous\r\nexpense; but they want sons, so that at death they may have honorable\r\nexit from the world; and there is no honor equal to the honor of having\r\none's pyre lighted by one's son.  The father who dies sonless is in a\r\ngrievous situation indeed, and is pitied.  Life being uncertain, the\r\nHindoo marries while he is still a boy, in the hope that he will have a\r\nson ready when the day of his need shall come.  But if he have no son, he\r\nwill adopt one.  This answers every purpose.\r\n\r\nMeantime the corpse is burning, also several others.  It is a dismal\r\nbusiness.  The stokers did not sit down in idleness, but moved briskly\r\nabout, punching up the fires with long poles, and now and then adding\r\nfuel.  Sometimes they hoisted the half of a skeleton into the air, then\r\nslammed it down and beat it with the pole, breaking it up so that it\r\nwould burn better.  They hoisted skulls up in the same way and banged and\r\nbattered them.  The sight was hard to bear; it would have been harder if\r\nthe mourners had stayed to witness it.  I had but a moderate desire to\r\nsee a cremation, so it was soon satisfied.  For sanitary reasons it would\r\nbe well if cremation were universal; but this form is revolting, and not\r\nto be recommended.\r\n\r\nThe fire used is sacred, of course--for there is money in it.  Ordinary\r\nfire is forbidden; there is no money in it.  I was told that this sacred\r\nfire is all furnished by one person, and that he has a monopoly of it and\r\ncharges a good price for it.  Sometimes a rich mourner pays a thousand\r\nrupees for it.  To get to paradise from India is an expensive thing.\r\nEvery detail connected with the matter costs something, and helps to\r\nfatten a priest.  I suppose it is quite safe to conclude that that\r\nfire-bug is in holy orders.\r\n\r\nClose to the cremation-ground stand a few time-worn stones which are\r\nremembrances of the suttee.  Each has a rough carving upon it,\r\nrepresenting a man and a woman standing or walking hand in hand, and\r\nmarks the spot where a widow went to her death by fire in the days when\r\nthe suttee flourished.  Mr. Parker said that widows would burn themselves\r\nnow if the government would allow it.  The family that can point to one\r\nof these little memorials and say: \xe2\x80\x9cShe who burned herself there was an\r\nancestress of ours,\xe2\x80\x9d is envied.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious people.  With them, all life seems to be sacred except\r\nhuman life.  Even the life of vermin is sacred, and must not be taken.\r\nThe good Jain wipes off a seat before using it, lest he cause the death\r\nof-some valueless insect by sitting down on it.  It grieves him to have\r\nto drink water, because the provisions in his stomach may not agree with\r\nthe microbes.  Yet India invented Thuggery and the Suttee.  India is a\r\nhard country to understand.  We went to the temple of the Thug goddess,\r\nBhowanee, or Kali, or Durga.  She has these names and others.  She is the\r\nonly god to whom living sacrifices are made.  Goats are sacrificed to\r\nher.  Monkeys would be cheaper.  There are plenty of them about the\r\nplace.  Being sacred, they make themselves very free, and scramble around\r\nwherever they please.  The temple and its porch are beautifully carved,\r\nbut this is not the case with the idol.  Bhowanee is not pleasant to look\r\nat.  She has a silver face, and a projecting swollen  tongue painted a\r\ndeep red.  She wears a necklace of skulls.\r\n\r\nIn fact, none of the idols in Benares are handsome or attractive.  And\r\nwhat a swarm of them there is!  The town is a vast museum of idols--and\r\nall of them crude, misshapen, and ugly.  They flock through one's dreams\r\nat night, a wild mob of nightmares.  When you get tired of them in the\r\ntemples and take a trip on the river, you find idol giants, flashily\r\npainted, stretched out side by side on the shore.  And apparently\r\nwherever there is room for one more lingam, a lingam is there.  If Vishnu\r\nhad foreseen what his town was going to be, he would have called it\r\nIdolville or Lingamburg.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous feature of Benares is the pair of slender white\r\nminarets which tower like masts from the great Mosque of Aurangzeb.  They\r\nseem to be always in sight, from everywhere, those airy, graceful,\r\ninspiring things.  But masts is not the right word, for masts have a\r\nperceptible taper, while these minarets have not.  They are 142 feet\r\nhigh, and only 8 1/2 feet in diameter at the base, and 7 1/2 at the\r\nsummit--scarcely any taper at all.  These are the proportions of a\r\ncandle; and fair and fairylike candles these are.  Will be, anyway, some\r\nday, when the Christians inherit them and top them with the electric\r\nlight.  There is a great view from up there--a wonderful view.  A large\r\ngray monkey was part of it, and damaged it.  A monkey has no judgment.\r\nThis one was skipping about the upper great heights of the mosque\r\n--skipping across empty yawning intervals which were almost too wide for\r\nhim, and which he only just barely cleared, each time, by the skin of his\r\nteeth.  He got me so nervous that I couldn't look at the view.  I\r\ncouldn't look at anything but him.  Every time he went sailing over one\r\nof those abysses my breath stood still, and when he grabbed for the perch\r\nhe was going for, I grabbed too, in sympathy.  And he was perfectly\r\nindifferent, perfectly unconcerned, and I did all the panting myself.\r\nHe came within an ace of losing his life a dozen times, and I was so\r\ntroubled about him that I would have shot him if I had had anything to do\r\nit with.  But I strongly recommend the view.  There is more monkey than\r\nview, and there is always going to be more monkey while that idiot\r\nsurvives, but what view you get is superb.  All Benares, the river, and\r\nthe region round about are spread before you.  Take a gun, and look at\r\nthe view.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I saw was more reposeful.  It was a new kind of art.  It\r\nwas a picture painted on water.  It was done by a native.  He sprinkled\r\nfine dust of various colors on the still surface of a basin of water, and\r\nout of these sprinklings a dainty and pretty picture gradually grew, a\r\npicture which a breath could destroy.  Somehow it was impressive, after\r\nso much browsing among massive and battered and decaying fanes that rest\r\nupon ruins, and those ruins upon still other ruins, and those upon still\r\nothers again.  It was a sermon, an allegory, a symbol of Instability.\r\nThose creations in stone were only a kind of water pictures, after all.\r\n\r\nA prominent episode in the Indian career of Warren Hastings had Benares\r\nfor its theater.  Wherever that extraordinary man set his foot, he left\r\nhis mark.  He came to Benares in 1781 to collect a fine of L500,000 which\r\nhe had levied upon its Rajah, Cheit Singh, on behalf of the East India\r\nCompany.  Hastings was a long way from home and help.  There were,\r\nprobably, not a dozen Englishmen within reach; the Rajah was in his fort\r\nwith his myriads around him.  But no matter.  From his little camp in a\r\nneighboring garden, Hastings sent a party to arrest the sovereign.  He\r\nsent on this daring mission a couple of hundred native soldiers--sepoys\r\n--under command of three young English lieutenants.  The Rajah submitted\r\nwithout a word.  The incident lights up the Indian situation\r\nelectrically, and gives one a vivid sense of the strides which the\r\nEnglish had made and the mastership they had acquired in the land since\r\nthe date of Clive's great victory.  In a quarter of a century, from being\r\nnobodies, and feared by none, they were become confessed lords and\r\nmasters, feared by all, sovereigns included, and served by all,\r\nsovereigns included.  It makes the fairy tales sound true.  The English\r\nhad not been afraid to enlist native soldiers to fight against their own\r\npeople and keep them obedient.  And now Hastings was not afraid to come\r\naway out to this remote place with a handful of such soldiers and send\r\nthem to arrest a native sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenants imprisoned the Rajah in his own fort.  It was beautiful,\r\nthe pluckiness of it, the impudence of it.  The arrest enraged the\r\nRajah's people, and all Benares came storming about the place and\r\nthreatening vengeance.  And yet, but for an accident, nothing important\r\nwould have resulted, perhaps.  The mob found out a most strange thing, an\r\nalmost incredible thing--that this handful of soldiers had come on this\r\nhardy errand with empty guns and no ammunition.  This has been attributed\r\nto thoughtlessness, but it could hardly have been that, for in such large\r\nemergencies as this, intelligent people do think.  It must have been\r\nindifference, an over-confidence born of the proved submissiveness of the\r\nnative character, when confronted by even one or two stern Britons in\r\ntheir war paint.  But, however that may be, it was a fatal discovery that\r\nthe mob had made.  They were full of courage, now, and they broke into\r\nthe fort and massacred the helpless soldiers and their officers.\r\nHastings escaped from Benares by night and got safely away, leaving the\r\nprincipality in a state of wild insurrection; but he was back again\r\nwithin the month, and quieted it down in his prompt and virile way, and\r\ntook the Rajah's throne away from him and gave it to another man.  He was\r\na capable kind of person was Warren Hastings.  This was the only time he\r\nwas ever out of ammunition.  Some of his acts have left stains upon his\r\nname which can never be washed away, but he saved to England the Indian\r\nEmpire, and that was the best service that was ever done to the Indians\r\nthemselves, those wretched heirs of a hundred centuries of pitiless\r\noppression and abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nTrue irreverence is disrespect for another man's god.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nIt was in Benares that I saw another living god.  That makes two.\r\nI believe I have seen most of the greater and lesser wonders of the\r\nworld, but I do not remember that any of them interested me so\r\noverwhelmingly as did that pair of gods.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to account for this effect I find no difficulty about it.\r\nI find that, as a rule, when a thing is a wonder to us it is not because\r\nof what we see in it, but because of what others have seen in it.  We get\r\nalmost all our wonders at second hand.  We are eager to see any\r\ncelebrated thing--and we never fail of our reward; just the deep\r\nprivilege of gazing upon an object which has stirred the enthusiasm or\r\nevoked the reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our race\r\nis a thing which we value; we are profoundly glad that we have seen it,\r\nwe are permanently enriched from having seen it, we would not part with\r\nthe memory of that experience for a great price.  And yet that very\r\nspectacle may be the Taj.  You cannot keep your enthusiasms down, you\r\ncannot keep your emotions within bounds when that soaring bubble of\r\nmarble breaks upon your view.  But these are not your enthusiasms and\r\nemotions--they are the accumulated emotions and enthusiasms of a thousand\r\nfervid writers, who have been slowly and steadily storing them up in your\r\nheart day by day and year by year all your life; and now they burst out\r\nin a flood and overwhelm you; and you could not be a whit happier if they\r\nwere your very own.  By and by you sober down, and then you perceive that\r\nyou have been drunk on the smell of somebody else's cork.  For ever and\r\never the memory of my distant first glimpse of the Taj will compensate me\r\nfor creeping around the globe to have that great privilege.\r\n\r\nBut the Taj--with all your inflation of delusive emotions, acquired at\r\nsecond-hand from people to whom in the majority of cases they were also\r\ndelusions acquired at second-hand--a thing which you fortunately did not\r\nthink of or it might have made you doubtful of what you imagined were\r\nyour own what is the Taj as a marvel, a spectacle and an uplifting and\r\noverpowering wonder, compared with a living, breathing, speaking\r\npersonage whom several millions of human beings devoutly and sincerely\r\nand unquestioningly believe to be a God, and humbly and gratefully\r\nworship as a God?\r\n\r\nHe was sixty years old when I saw him.  He is called Sri 108 Swami\r\nBhaskarananda Saraswati.  That is one form of it.  I think that that is\r\nwhat you would call him in speaking to him--because it is short.  But you\r\nwould use more of his name in addressing a letter to him; courtesy would\r\nrequire this.  Even then you would not have to use all of it, but only\r\nthis much:\r\n\r\nSri 108 Matparamahansrzpairivrajakacharyaswamibhaskaranandasaraswati.\r\n\r\nYou do not put \xe2\x80\x9cEsq.\xe2\x80\x9d after it, for that is not necessary.  The word\r\nwhich opens the volley is itself a title of honor \xe2\x80\x9cSri.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9c108\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n stands for the rest of his names, I believe.  Vishnu has 108 names which\r\nhe does not use in business, and no doubt it is a custom of gods and a\r\nprivilege sacred to their order to keep 108 extra ones in stock.  Just\r\nthe restricted name set down above is a handsome property, without the\r\n108.  By my count it has 58 letters in it.  This removes the long German\r\nwords from competition; they are permanently out of the race.\r\n\r\nSri 108 S. B. Saraswati has attained to what among the Hindoos is called\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cstate of perfection.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a state which other Hindoos reach by\r\nbeing born again and again, and over and over again into this world,\r\nthrough one re-incarnation after another--a tiresome long job covering\r\ncenturies and decades of centuries, and one that is full of risks, too,\r\nlike the accident of dying on the wrong side of the Ganges some time or\r\nother and waking up in the form of an ass, with a fresh start necessary\r\nand the numerous trips to be made all over again.  But in reaching\r\nperfection, Sri 108 S. B. S.  has escaped all that.  He is no longer a\r\npart or a feature of this world; his substance has changed, all\r\nearthiness has departed out of it; he is utterly holy, utterly pure;\r\nnothing can desecrate this holiness or stain this purity; he is no longer\r\nof the earth, its concerns are matters foreign to him, its pains and\r\ngriefs and troubles cannot reach him.  When he dies, Nirvana is his; he\r\nwill be absorbed into the substance of the Supreme Deity and be at peace\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe Hindoo Scriptures point out how this state is to be reached, but it\r\nis only once in a thousand years, perhaps, that candidate accomplishes\r\nit.  This one has traversed the course required, stage by stage, from the\r\nbeginning to the end, and now has nothing left to do but wait for the\r\ncall which shall release him from a world in which he has now no part nor\r\nlot.  First, he passed through the student stage, and became learned in\r\nthe holy books.  Next he became citizen, householder, husband, and\r\nfather.  That was the required second stage.  Then--like John Bunyan's\r\nChristian he bade perpetual good-bye to his family, as required, and went\r\nwandering away.  He went far into the desert and served a term as hermit.\r\nNext, he became a beggar, \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with the rites laid down in the\r\nScriptures,\xe2\x80\x9d and wandered about India eating the bread of mendicancy.  A\r\nquarter of a century ago he reached the stage of purity.  This needs no\r\ngarment; its symbol is nudity; he discarded the waist-cloth which he had\r\npreviously worn.  He could resume it now if he chose, for neither that\r\nnor any other contact can defile him; but he does not choose.\r\n\r\nThere are several other stages, I believe, but I do not remember what\r\nthey are.  But he has been through them.  Throughout the long course he\r\nwas perfecting himself in holy learning, and writing commentaries upon\r\nthe sacred books.  He was also meditating upon Brahma, and he does that\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nWhite marble relief-portraits of him are sold all about India.  He lives\r\nin a good house in a noble great garden in Benares, all meet and proper\r\nto his stupendous rank.  Necessarily he does not go abroad in the\r\nstreets.  Deities would never be able to move about handily in any\r\ncountry.  If one whom we recognized and adored as a god should go abroad\r\nin our streets, and the day it was to happen were known, all traffic\r\nwould be blocked and business would come to a standstill.\r\n\r\nThis god is comfortably housed, and yet modestly, all things considered,\r\nfor if he wanted to live in a palace he would only need to speak and his\r\nworshipers would gladly build it.  Sometimes he sees devotees for a\r\nmoment, and comforts them and blesses them, and they kiss his feet and go\r\naway happy.  Rank is nothing to him, he being a god.  To him all men are\r\nalike.  He sees whom he pleases and denies himself to whom he pleases.\r\nSometimes he sees a prince and denies himself to a pauper; at other times\r\nhe receives the pauper and turns the prince away.  However, he does not\r\nreceive many of either class.  He has to husband his time for his\r\nmeditations.  I think he would receive Rev. Mr. Parker at any time.  I\r\nthink he is sorry for Mr. Parker, and I think Mr. Parker is sorry for\r\nhim; and no doubt this compassion is good for both of them.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived we had to stand around in the garden a little while and\r\nwait, and the outlook was not good, for he had been turning away\r\nMaharajas that day and receiving only the riff-raff, and we belonged in\r\nbetween, somewhere.  But presently, a servant came out saying it was all\r\nright, he was coming.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, he came, and I saw him--that object of the worship of\r\nmillions.  It was a strange sensation, and thrilling.  I wish I could\r\nfeel it stream through my veins again.  And yet, to me he was not a god,\r\nhe was only a Taj.  The thrill was not my thrill, but had come to me\r\nsecondhand from those invisible millions of believers.  By a hand-shake\r\nwith their god I had ground-circuited their wire and got their monster\r\nbattery's whole charge.\r\n\r\nHe was tall and slender, indeed emaciated.  He had a clean cut and\r\nconspicuously intellectual face, and a deep and kindly eye.  He looked\r\nmany years older than he really was, but much study and meditation and\r\nfasting and prayer, with the arid life he had led as hermit and beggar,\r\ncould account for that.  He is wholly nude when he receives natives, of\r\nwhatever rank they may be, but he had white cloth around his loins now, a\r\nconcession to Mr. Parker's European prejudices, no doubt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had sobered down a little we got along very well together,\r\nand I found him a most pleasant and friendly deity.  He had heard a deal\r\nabout Chicago, and showed a quite remarkable interest in it, for a god.\r\nIt all came of the World's Fair and the Congress of Religions.  If India\r\nknows about nothing else American, she knows about those, and will keep\r\nthem in mind one while.\r\n\r\nHe proposed an exchange of autographs, a delicate attention which made me\r\nbelieve in him, but I had been having my doubts before.  He wrote his in\r\nhis book, and I have a reverent regard for that book, though the words\r\nrun from right to left, and so I can't read it.  It was a mistake to\r\nprint in that way.  It contains his voluminous comments on the Hindoo\r\nholy writings, and if I could make them out I would try for perfection\r\nmyself.  I gave him a copy of Huckleberry Finn.  I thought it might rest\r\nhim up a little to mix it in along with his meditations on Brahma, for he\r\nlooked tired, and I knew that if it didn't do him any good it wouldn't do\r\nhim any harm.\r\n\r\nHe has a scholar meditating under him--Mina Bahadur Rana--but we did not\r\nsee him.  He wears clothes and is very imperfect.  He has written a\r\nlittle pamphlet about his master, and I have that.  It contains a\r\nwood-cut of the master and himself seated on a rug in the garden.  The\r\nportrait of the master is very good indeed.  The posture is exactly that\r\nwhich Brahma himself affects, and it requires long arms and limber legs,\r\nand can be accumulated only by gods and the india-rubber man.  There is a\r\nlife-size marble relief of Shri 108, S.B.S.  in the garden.  It\r\nrepresents him in this same posture.\r\n\r\nDear me!  It is a strange world.  Particularly the Indian division of it.\r\nThis pupil, Mina Bahadur Rana, is not a commonplace person, but a man of\r\ndistinguished capacities and attainments, and, apparently, he had a fine\r\nworldly career in front of him.  He was serving the Nepal Government in a\r\nhigh capacity at the Court of the Viceroy of India, twenty years ago.  He\r\nwas an able man, educated, a thinker, a man of property.  But the longing\r\nto devote himself to a religious life came upon him, and he resigned his\r\nplace, turned his back upon the vanities and comforts of the world, and\r\nwent away into the solitudes to live in a hut and study the sacred\r\nwritings and meditate upon virtue and holiness and seek to attain them.\r\nThis sort of religion resembles ours.  Christ recommended the rich to\r\ngive away all their property and follow Him in poverty, not in worldly\r\ncomfort.  American and English millionaires do it every day, and thus\r\nverify and confirm to the world the tremendous forces that lie in\r\nreligion.  Yet many people scoff at them for this loyalty to duty, and\r\nmany will scoff at Mina Bahadur Rana and call him a crank.  Like many\r\nChristians of great character and intellect, he has made the study of his\r\nScriptures and the writing of books of commentaries upon them the loving\r\nlabor of his life.  Like them, he has believed that his was not an idle\r\nand foolish waste of his life, but a most worthy and honorable employment\r\nof it.  Yet, there are many people who will see in those others, men\r\nworthy of homage and deep reverence, but in him merely a crank.  But I\r\nshall not.  He has my reverence.  And I don't offer it as a common thing\r\nand poor, but as an unusual thing and of value.  The ordinary reverence,\r\nthe reverence defined and explained by the dictionary costs nothing.\r\nReverence for one's own sacred things--parents, religion, flag, laws, and\r\nrespect for one's own beliefs--these are feelings which we cannot even\r\nhelp.  They come natural to us; they are involuntary, like breathing.\r\nThere is no personal merit in breathing.  But the reverence which is\r\ndifficult, and which has personal merit in it, is the respect which you\r\npay, without compulsion, to the political or religious attitude of a man\r\nwhose beliefs are not yours.  You can't revere his gods or his politics,\r\nand no one expects you to do that, but you could respect his belief in\r\nthem if you tried hard enough; and you could respect him, too, if you\r\ntried hard enough.  But it is very, very difficult; it is next to\r\nimpossible, and so we hardly ever try.  If the man doesn't believe as we\r\ndo, we say he is a crank, and that settles it.  I mean it does nowadays,\r\nbecause now we can't burn him.\r\n\r\nWe are always canting about people's \xe2\x80\x9cirreverence,\xe2\x80\x9d always charging this\r\noffense upon somebody or other, and thereby intimating that we are better\r\nthan that person and do not commit that offense ourselves.  Whenever we\r\ndo this we are in a lying attitude, and our speech is cant; for none of\r\nus are reverent--in a meritorious way; deep down in our hearts we are all\r\nirreverent.  There is probably not a single exception to this rule in the\r\nearth.  There is probably not one person whose reverence rises higher\r\nthan respect for his own sacred things; and therefore, it is not a thing\r\nto boast about and be proud of, since the most degraded savage has that\r\n--and, like the best of us, has nothing higher.  To speak plainly, we\r\ndespise all reverences and all objects of reverence which are outside the\r\npale of our own list of sacred things.  And yet, with strange\r\ninconsistency, we are shocked when other people despise and defile the\r\nthings which are holy to us.  Suppose we should meet with a paragraph\r\nlike the following, in the newspapers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday a visiting party of the British nobility had a picnic at Mount\r\nVernon, and in the tomb of Washington they ate their luncheon, sang\r\npopular songs, played games, and danced waltzes and polkas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShould we be shocked?  Should we feel outraged?  Should we be amazed?\r\nShould we call the performance a desecration?  Yes, that would all\r\nhappen.  We should denounce those people in round terms, and call them\r\nhard names.\r\n\r\nAnd suppose we found this paragraph in the newspapers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday a visiting party of American pork-millionaires had a picnic in\r\nWestminster Abbey, and in that sacred place they ate their luncheon, sang\r\npopular songs, played games, and danced waltzes and polkas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWould the English be shocked?  Would they feel outraged?  Would they be\r\namazed?  Would they call the performance a desecration?  That would all\r\nhappen.  The pork-millionaires would be denounced in round terms; they\r\nwould be called hard names.\r\n\r\nIn the tomb at Mount Vernon lie the ashes of America's most honored son;\r\nin the Abbey, the ashes of England's greatest dead; the tomb of tombs,\r\nthe costliest in the earth, the wonder of the world, the Taj, was built\r\nby a great Emperor to honor the memory of a perfect wife and perfect\r\nmother, one in whom there was no spot or blemish, whose love was his stay\r\nand support, whose life was the light of the world to him; in it her\r\nashes lie, and to the Mohammedan millions of India it is a holy place; to\r\nthem it is what Mount Vernon is to Americans, it is what the Abbey is to\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nMajor Sleeman wrote forty or fifty years ago (the italics are mine):\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI would here enter my humble protest against the quadrille and\r\n     lunch parties which are sometimes given to European ladies and\r\n     gentlemen of the station at this imperial tomb; drinking and dancing\r\n     are no doubt very good things in their season, but they are sadly\r\n     out of place in a sepulchre.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWere there any Americans among those lunch parties?  If they were\r\ninvited, there were.\r\n\r\nIf my imagined lunch-parties in Westminster and the tomb of Washington\r\nshould take place, the incident would cause a vast outbreak of bitter\r\neloquence about Barbarism and Irreverence; and it would come from two\r\nsets of people who would go next day and dance in the Taj if they had a\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nAs we took our leave of the Benares god and started away we noticed a\r\ngroup of natives waiting respectfully just within the gate--a Rajah from\r\nsomewhere in India, and some people of lesser consequence.  The god\r\nbeckoned them to come, and as we passed out the Rajah was kneeling and\r\nreverently kissing his sacred feet.\r\n\r\nIf Barnum--but Barnum's ambitions are at rest.  This god will remain in\r\nthe holy peace and seclusion of his garden, undisturbed.  Barnum could\r\nnot have gotten him, anyway.  Still, he would have found a substitute\r\nthat would answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nDo not undervalue the headache.  While it is at its sharpest it seems a\r\nbad investment; but when relief begins, the unexpired remainder is worth\r\n$4 a minute.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nA comfortable railway journey of seventeen and a half hours brought us to\r\nthe capital of India, which is likewise the capital of Bengal--Calcutta.\r\nLike Bombay, it has a population of nearly a million natives and a small\r\ngathering of white people.  It is a huge city and fine, and is called the\r\nCity of Palaces.  It is rich in historical memories; rich in British\r\nachievement--military, political, commercial; rich in the results of the\r\nmiracles done by that brace of mighty magicians, Clive and Hastings.  And\r\nhas a cloud kissing monument to one Ochterlony.\r\n\r\nIt is a fluted candlestick 250 feet high.  This lingam is the only large\r\nmonument in Calcutta, I believe.  It is a fine ornament, and will keep\r\nOchterlony in mind.\r\n\r\nWherever you are, in Calcutta, and for miles around, you can see it; and\r\nalways when you see it you think of Ochterlony.  And so there is not an\r\nhour in the day that you do not think of Ochterlony and wonder who he\r\nwas.  It is good that Clive cannot come back, for he would think it was\r\nfor Plassey; and then that great spirit would be wounded when the\r\nrevelation came that it was not.  Clive would find out that it was for\r\nOchterlony; and he would think Ochterlony was a battle.  And he would\r\nthink it was a great one, too, and he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cWith three thousand I\r\nwhipped sixty thousand and founded the Empire--and there is no monument;\r\nthis other soldier must have whipped a billion with a dozen and saved the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut he would be mistaken.  Ochterlony was a man, not a battle.  And he\r\ndid good and honorable service, too; as good and honorable service as has\r\nbeen done in India by seventy-five or a hundred other Englishmen of\r\ncourage, rectitude, and distinguished capacity.  For India has been a\r\nfertile breeding-ground of such men, and remains so; great men, both in\r\nwar and in the civil service, and as modest as great.  But they have no\r\nmonuments, and were not expecting any.  Ochterlony could not have been\r\nexpecting one, and it is not at all likely that he desired one--certainly\r\nnot until Clive and Hastings should be supplied.  Every day Clive and\r\nHastings lean on the battlements of heaven and look down and wonder which\r\nof the two the monument is for; and they fret and worry because they\r\ncannot find out, and so the peace of heaven is spoiled for them and lost.\r\nBut not for Ochterlony.  Ochterlony is not troubled.  He doesn't suspect\r\nthat it is his monument.  Heaven is sweet and peaceful to him.  There is\r\na sort of unfairness about it all.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if monuments were always given in India for high achievements,\r\nduty straitly performed, and smirchless records, the landscape would be\r\nmonotonous with them.  The handful of English in India govern the Indian\r\nmyriads with apparent ease, and without noticeable friction, through\r\ntact, training, and distinguished administrative ability, reinforced by\r\njust and liberal laws--and by keeping their word to the native whenever\r\nthey give it.\r\n\r\nEngland is far from India and knows little about the eminent services\r\nperformed by her servants there, for it is the newspaper correspondent\r\nwho makes fame, and he is not sent to India but to the continent, to\r\nreport the doings of the princelets and the dukelets, and where they are\r\nvisiting and whom they are marrying.  Often a British official spends\r\nthirty or forty years in India, climbing from grade to grade by services\r\nwhich would make him celebrated anywhere else, and finishes as a\r\nvice-sovereign, governing a great realm and millions of subjects; then he\r\ngoes home to England substantially unknown and unheard of, and settles\r\ndown in some modest corner, and is as one extinguished.  Ten years later\r\nthere is a twenty-line obituary in the London papers, and the reader is\r\nparalyzed by the splendors of a career which he is not sure that he had\r\never heard of before.  But meanwhile he has learned all about the\r\ncontinental princelets and dukelets.\r\n\r\nThe average man is profoundly ignorant of countries that lie remote from\r\nhis own.  When they are mentioned in his presence one or two facts and\r\nmaybe a couple of names rise like torches in his mind, lighting up an\r\ninch or two of it and leaving the rest all dark.  The mention of Egypt\r\nsuggests some Biblical facts and the Pyramids-nothing more.  The mention\r\nof South Africa suggests Kimberly and the diamonds and there an end.\r\nFormerly the mention, to a Hindoo, of America suggested a name--George\r\nWashington--with that his familiarity with our country was exhausted.\r\nLatterly his familiarity with it has doubled in bulk; so that when\r\nAmerica is mentioned now, two torches flare up in the dark caverns of his\r\nmind and he says, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, the country of the great man Washington; and of\r\nthe Holy City--Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d  For he knows about the Congress of Religion,\r\nand\r\nthis has enabled him to get an erroneous impression of Chicago.\r\n\r\nWhen India is mentioned to the citizen of a far country it suggests\r\nClive, Hastings, the Mutiny, Kipling, and a number of other great events;\r\nand the mention of Calcutta infallibly brings up the Black Hole.  And so,\r\nwhen that citizen finds himself in the capital of India he goes first of\r\nall to see the Black Hole of Calcutta--and is disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hole was not preserved; it is gone, long, long ago.  It is\r\nstrange.  Just as it stood, it was itself a monument; a ready-made one.\r\nIt was finished, it was complete, its materials were strong and lasting,\r\nit needed no furbishing up, no repairs; it merely needed to be let alone.\r\nIt was the first brick, the Foundation Stone, upon which was reared a\r\nmighty Empire--the Indian Empire of Great Britain.  It was the ghastly\r\nepisode of the Black Hole that maddened the British and brought Clive,\r\nthat young military marvel, raging up from Madras; it was the seed from\r\nwhich sprung Plassey; and it was that extraordinary battle, whose like\r\nhad not been seen in the earth since Agincourt, that laid deep and strong\r\nthe foundations of England's colossal Indian sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAnd yet within the time of men who still live, the Black Hole was torn\r\ndown and thrown away as carelessly as if its bricks were common clay, not\r\ningots of historic gold.  There is no accounting for human beings.\r\n\r\nThe supposed site of the Black Hole is marked by an engraved plate.  I\r\nsaw that; and better that than nothing.  The Black Hole was a prison--a\r\ncell is nearer the right word--eighteen feet square, the dimensions of an\r\nordinary bedchamber; and into this place the victorious Nabob of Bengal\r\npacked 146 of his English prisoners.  There was hardly standing room for\r\nthem; scarcely a breath of air was to be got; the time was night, the\r\nweather sweltering hot.  Before the dawn came, the captives were all dead\r\nbut twenty-three.  Mr. Holwell's long account of the awful episode was\r\nfamiliar to the world a hundred years ago, but one seldom sees in print\r\neven an extract from it in our day.  Among the striking things in it is\r\nthis.  Mr. Holwell, perishing with thirst, kept himself alive by sucking\r\nthe perspiration from his sleeves.  It gives one a vivid idea of the\r\nsituation.  He presently found that while he was busy drawing life from\r\none of his sleeves a young English gentleman was stealing supplies from\r\nthe other one.  Holwell was an unselfish man, a man of the most generous\r\nimpulses; he lived and died famous for these fine and rare qualities; yet\r\nwhen he found out what was happening to that unwatched sleeve, he took\r\nthe precaution to suck that one dry first.  The miseries of the Black\r\nHole were able to change even a nature like his.  But that young\r\ngentleman was one of the twenty-three survivors, and he said it was the\r\nstolen perspiration that saved his life.  From the middle of Mr.\r\nHolwell's narrative I will make a brief excerpt:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThen a general prayer to Heaven, to hasten the approach of the\r\n     flames to the right and left of us, and put a period to our misery.\r\n     But these failing, they whose strength and spirits were quite\r\n     exhausted laid themselves down and expired quietly upon their\r\n     fellows: others who had yet some strength and vigor left made a last\r\n     effort at the windows, and several succeeded by leaping and\r\n     scrambling over the backs and heads of those in the first rank, and\r\n     got hold of the bars, from which there was no removing them.  Many\r\n     to the right and left sunk with the violent pressure, and were soon\r\n     suffocated; for now a steam arose from the living and the dead,\r\n     which affected us in all its circumstances as if we were forcibly\r\n     held with our heads over a bowl full of strong volatile spirit of\r\n     hartshorn, until suffocated; nor could the effluvia of the one be\r\n     distinguished from the other, and frequently, when I was forced by\r\n     the load upon my head and shoulders to hold my face down, I was\r\n     obliged, near as I was to the window, instantly to raise it again to\r\n     avoid suffocation.  I need not, my dear friend, ask your\r\n     commiseration, when I tell you, that in this plight, from half an\r\n     hour past eleven till near two in the morning, I sustained the\r\n     weight of a heavy man, with his knees in my back, and the pressure\r\n     of his whole body on my head.  A Dutch surgeon who had taken his\r\n     seat upon my left shoulder, and a Topaz (a black Christian soldier)\r\n     bearing on my right; all which nothing could have enabled me to\r\n     support but the props and pressure equally sustaining me all around.\r\n     The two latter I frequently dislodged by shifting my hold on the\r\n     bars and driving my knuckles into their ribs; but my friend above\r\n     stuck fast, held immovable by two bars.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI exerted anew my strength and fortitude; but the repeated trials\r\n     and efforts I made to dislodge the insufferable incumbrances upon me\r\n     at last quite exhausted me; and towards two o'clock, finding I must\r\n     quit the window or sink where I was, I resolved on the former,\r\n     having bore, truly for the sake of others, infinitely more for life\r\n     than the best of it is worth.  In the rank close behind me was an\r\n     officer of one of the ships, whose name was Cary, and who had\r\n     behaved with much bravery during the siege (his wife, a fine woman,\r\n     though country born, would not quit him, but accompanied him into\r\n     the prison, and was one who survived).  This poor wretch had been\r\n     long raving for water and air; I told him I was determined to give\r\n     up life, and recommended his gaining my station.  On my quitting it\r\n     he made a fruitless attempt to get my place; but the Dutch surgeon,\r\n     who sat on my shoulder, supplanted him.  Poor Cary expressed his\r\n     thankfulness, and said he would give up life too; but it was with\r\n     the utmost labor we forced our way from the window (several in the\r\n     inner ranks appearing to me dead standing, unable to fall by the\r\n     throng and equal pressure around).  He laid himself down to die; and\r\n     his death, I believe, was very sudden; for he was a short, full,\r\n     sanguine man.  His strength was great; and, I imagine, had he not\r\n     retired with me, I should never have been able to force my way.  I\r\n     was at this time sensible of no pain, and little uneasiness; I can\r\n     give you no better idea of my situation than by repeating my simile\r\n     of the bowl of spirit of hartshorn.  I found a stupor coming on\r\n     apace, and laid myself down by that gallant old man, the Rev. Mr.\r\n     Jervas Bellamy, who laid dead with his son, the lieutenant, hand in\r\n     hand, near the southernmost wall of the prison.  When I had lain\r\n     there some little time, I still had reflection enough to suffer some\r\n     uneasiness in the thought that I should be trampled upon, when dead,\r\n     as I myself had done to others.  With some difficulty I raised\r\n     myself, and gained the platform a second time, where I presently\r\n     lost all sensation; the last trace of sensibility that I have been\r\n     able to recollect after my laying down, was my sash being uneasy\r\n     about my waist, which I untied, and threw from me.  Of what passed\r\n     in this interval, to the time of my resurrection from this hole of\r\n     horrors, I can give you no account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was plenty to see in Calcutta, but there was not plenty of time for\r\nit.  I saw the fort that Clive built; and the place where Warren Hastings\r\nand the author of the Junius Letters fought their duel; and the great\r\nbotanical gardens; and the fashionable afternoon turnout in the Maidan;\r\nand a grand review of the garrison in a great plain at sunrise; and a\r\nmilitary tournament in which great bodies of native soldiery exhibited\r\nthe perfection of their drill at all arms, a spectacular and beautiful\r\nshow occupying several nights and closing with the mimic storming of a\r\nnative fort which was as good as the reality for thrilling and accurate\r\ndetail, and better than the reality for security and comfort; we had a\r\npleasure excursion on the 'Hoogly' by courtesy of friends, and devoted\r\nthe rest of the time to social life and the Indian museum.  One should\r\nspend a month in the museum, an enchanted palace of Indian antiquities.\r\nIndeed, a person might spend half a year among the beautiful and\r\nwonderful things without exhausting their interest.\r\n\r\nIt was winter.  We were of Kipling's \xe2\x80\x9chosts of tourists who travel up and\r\ndown India in the cold weather showing how things ought to be managed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It is a common expression there, \xe2\x80\x9cthe cold weather,\xe2\x80\x9d and the people think\r\nthere is such a thing.  It is because they have lived there half a\r\nlifetime, and their perceptions have become blunted.  When a person is\r\naccustomed to 138 in the shade, his ideas about cold weather are not\r\nvaluable.  I had read, in the histories, that the June marches made\r\nbetween Lucknow and Cawnpore by the British forces in the time of the\r\nMutiny were made in that kind of weather--138 in the shade--and had taken\r\nit for historical embroidery.  I had read it again in Serjeant-Major\r\nForbes-Mitchell's account of his military experiences in the Mutiny\r\n--at least I thought I had--and in Calcutta I asked him if it was true,\r\nand he said it was.  An officer of high rank who had been in the thick of\r\nthe Mutiny said the same.  As long as those men were talking about what\r\nthey knew, they were trustworthy, and I believed them; but when they said\r\nit was now \xe2\x80\x9ccold weather,\xe2\x80\x9d I saw that they had traveled outside of their\r\nsphere of knowledge and were floundering.  I believe that in India \xe2\x80\x9ccold\r\nweather\xe2\x80\x9d is merely a conventional phrase and has come into use through\r\nthe necessity of having some way to distinguish between weather which\r\nwill melt a brass door-knob and weather which will only make it mushy.\r\nIt was observable that brass ones were in use while I was in Calcutta,\r\nshowing that it was not yet time to change to porcelain; I was told the\r\nchange to porcelain was not usually made until May.  But this cold\r\nweather was too warm for us; so we started to Darjeeling, in the\r\nHimalayas--a twenty-four hour journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nThere are 869 different forms of lying, but only one of them has been\r\nsquarely forbidden.  Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy\r\nneighbor.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM DIARY:\r\n\r\nFebruary 14.  We left at 4:30 P.M.  Until dark we moved through rich\r\nvegetation, then changed to a boat and crossed the Ganges.\r\n\r\nFebruary 15.  Up with the sun.  A brilliant morning, and frosty.  A\r\ndouble suit of flannels is found necessary.  The plain is perfectly\r\nlevel, and seems to stretch away and away and away, dimming and\r\nsoftening, to the uttermost bounds of nowhere.  What a soaring,\r\nstrenuous, gushing fountain spray of delicate greenery a bunch of bamboo\r\nis!  As far as the eye can reach, these grand vegetable geysers grace the\r\nview, their spoutings refined to steam by distance.  And there are fields\r\nof bananas, with the sunshine glancing from the varnished surface of\r\ntheir drooping vast leaves.  And there are frequent groves of palm; and\r\nan effective accent is given to the landscape by isolated individuals of\r\nthis picturesque family, towering, clean-stemmed, their plumes broken and\r\nhanging ragged, Nature's imitation of an umbrella that has been out to\r\nsee what a cyclone is like and is trying not to look disappointed.  And\r\neverywhere through the soft morning vistas we glimpse the villages, the\r\ncountless villages, the myriad villages, thatched, built of clean new\r\nmatting, snuggling among grouped palms and sheaves of bamboo; villages,\r\nvillages, no end of villages, not three hundred yards apart, and dozens\r\nand dozens of them in sight all the time; a mighty City, hundreds of\r\nmiles long, hundreds of miles broad, made all of villages, the biggest\r\ncity in the earth, and as populous as a European kingdom.  I have seen no\r\nsuch city as this before.  And there is a continuously repeated and\r\nreplenished multitude of naked men in view on both sides and ahead.  We\r\nfly through it mile after mile, but still it is always there, on both\r\nsides and ahead--brown-bodied, naked men and boys, plowing in the fields.\r\nBut not a woman.  In these two hours I have not seen a woman or a girl\r\nworking in the fields.\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Greenland's icy mountains,\r\n               From India's coral strand,\r\n               Where Afric's sunny fountains\r\n               Roll down their golden sand.\r\n               From many an ancient river,\r\n               From many a palmy plain,\r\n               They call us to deliver\r\n               Their land from error's chain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThose are beautiful verses, and they have remained in my memory all my\r\nlife.  But if the closing lines are true, let us hope that when we come\r\nto answer the call and deliver the land from its errors, we shall secrete\r\nfrom it some of our high-civilization ways, and at the same time borrow\r\nsome of its pagan ways to enrich our high system with.  We have a right\r\nto do this.  If we lift those people up, we have a right to lift\r\nourselves up nine or ten grades or so, at their expense.  A few years ago\r\nI spent several weeks at Tolz, in Bavaria.  It is a Roman Catholic\r\nregion, and not even Benares is more deeply or pervasively or\r\nintelligently devout.  In my diary of those days I find this:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWe took a long drive yesterday around about the lovely country\r\n     roads.  But it was a drive whose pleasure was damaged in a couple of\r\n     ways: by the dreadful shrines and by the shameful spectacle of gray\r\n     and venerable old grandmothers toiling in the fields.  The shrines\r\n     were frequent along the roads--figures of the Saviour nailed to the\r\n     cross and streaming with blood from the wounds of the nails and the\r\n     thorns.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen missionaries go from here do they find fault with the pagan\r\n     idols?  I saw many women seventy and even eighty years old mowing\r\n     and binding in the fields, and pitchforking the loads into the\r\n     wagons.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was in Austria later, and in Munich.  In Munich I saw gray old women\r\npushing trucks up hill and down, long distances, trucks laden with\r\nbarrels of beer, incredible loads.  In my Austrian diary I find this:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the fields I often see a woman and a cow harnessed to the plow,\r\n     and a man driving.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the public street of Marienbad to-day, I saw an old, bent,\r\n     gray-headed woman, in harness with a dog, drawing a laden sled over\r\n     bare dirt roads and bare pavements; and at his ease walked the\r\n     driver, smoking his pipe, a hale fellow not thirty years old.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFive or six years ago I bought an open boat, made a kind of a canvas\r\nwagon-roof over the stern of it to shelter me from sun and rain; hired a\r\ncourier and a boatman, and made a twelve-day floating voyage down the\r\nRhone from Lake Bourget to Marseilles.  In my diary of that trip I find\r\nthis entry.  I was far down the Rhone then:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cPassing St. Etienne, 2:15 P.M.  On a distant ridge inland, a tall\r\n     openwork structure commandingly situated, with a statue of the\r\n     Virgin standing on it.  A devout country.  All down this river,\r\n     wherever there is a crag there is a statue of the Virgin on it.  I\r\n     believe I have seen a hundred of them.  And yet, in many respects,\r\n     the peasantry seem to be mere pagans, and destitute of any\r\n     considerable degree of civilization.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c .  .  .  .  We reached a not very promising looking village about\r\n     4 o'clock, and I concluded to tie up for the day; munching fruit and\r\n     fogging the hood with pipe-smoke had grown monotonous; I could not\r\n     have the hood furled, because the floods of rain fell unceasingly.\r\n     The tavern was on the river bank, as is the custom.  It was dull\r\n     there, and melancholy--nothing to do but look out of the window into\r\n     the drenching rain, and shiver; one could do that, for it was bleak\r\n     and cold and windy, and country France furnishes no fire.  Winter\r\n     overcoats did not help me much; they had to be supplemented with\r\n     rugs.  The raindrops were so large and struck the river with such\r\n     force that they knocked up the water like pebble-splashes.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWith the exception of a very occasional woodenshod peasant, nobody\r\n     was abroad in this bitter weather--I mean nobody of our sex.  But\r\n     all weathers are alike to the women in these continental countries.\r\n     To them and the other animals, life is serious; nothing interrupts\r\n     their slavery.  Three of them were washing clothes in the river\r\n     under the window when I arrived, and they continued at it as long as\r\n     there was light to work by.  One was apparently thirty; another--the\r\n     mother!--above fifty; the third--grandmother!--so old and worn and\r\n     gray she could have passed for eighty; I took her to be that old.\r\n     They had no waterproofs nor rubbers, of course; over their shoulders\r\n     they wore gunnysacks--simply conductors for rivers of water; some of\r\n     the volume reached the ground; the rest soaked in on the way.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt last a vigorous fellow of thirty-five arrived, dry and\r\n     comfortable, smoking his pipe under his big umbrella in an open\r\n     donkey-cart-husband, son, and grandson of those women!  He stood up\r\n     in the cart, sheltering himself, and began to superintend, issuing\r\n     his orders in a masterly tone of command, and showing temper when\r\n     they were not obeyed swiftly enough.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWithout complaint or murmur the drowned women patiently carried out\r\n     the orders, lifting the immense baskets of soggy, wrung-out clothing\r\n     into the cart and stowing them to the man's satisfaction.  There\r\n     were six of the great baskets, and a man of mere ordinary strength\r\n     could not have lifted any one of them.  The cart being full now, the\r\n     Frenchman descended, still sheltered by his umbrella, entered the\r\n     tavern, and the women went drooping homeward, trudging in the wake\r\n     of the cart, and soon were blended with the deluge and lost to\r\n     sight.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I went down into the public room, the Frenchman had his bottle\r\n     of wine and plate of food on a bare table black with grease, and was\r\n     'chomping' like a horse.  He had the little religious paper which is\r\n     in everybody's hands on the Rhone borders, and was enlightening\r\n     himself with the histories of French saints who used to flee to the\r\n     desert in the Middle Ages to escape the contamination of woman.  For\r\n     two hundred years France has been sending missionaries to other\r\n     savage lands.  To spare to the needy from poverty like hers is fine\r\n     and true generosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut to get back to India--where, as my favorite poem says--\r\n\r\n              \xe2\x80\x9cEvery prospect pleases,\r\n               And only man is vile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is because Bavaria and Austria and France have not introduced their\r\ncivilization to him yet.  But Bavaria and Austria and France are on their\r\nway.  They are coming.  They will rescue him; they will refine the\r\nvileness out of him.\r\n\r\nSome time during the forenoon, approaching the mountains, we changed from\r\nthe regular train to one composed of little canvas-sheltered cars that\r\nskimmed along within a foot of the ground and seemed to be going fifty\r\nmiles an hour when they were really making about twenty.  Each car had\r\nseating capacity for half-a-dozen persons; and when the curtains were up\r\none was substantially out of doors, and could see everywhere, and get all\r\nthe breeze, and be luxuriously comfortable.  It was not a pleasure\r\nexcursion in name only, but in fact.\r\n\r\nAfter a while we stopped at a little wooden coop of a station just\r\nwithin the curtain of the sombre jungle, a place with a deep and dense\r\nforest of great trees and scrub and vines all about it.  The royal Bengal\r\ntiger is in great force there, and is very bold and unconventional.  From\r\nthis lonely little station a message once went to the railway manager in\r\nCalcutta: \xe2\x80\x9cTiger eating station-master on front porch; telegraph\r\ninstructions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was there that I had my first tiger hunt.  I killed thirteen.  We were\r\npresently away again, and the train began to climb the mountains.  In one\r\nplace seven wild elephants crossed the track, but two of them got away\r\nbefore I could overtake them.  The railway journey up the mountain is\r\nforty miles, and it takes eight hours to make it.  It is so wild and\r\ninteresting and exciting and enchanting that it ought to take a week.  As\r\nfor the vegetation, it is a museum.  The jungle seemed to contain samples\r\nof every rare and curious tree and bush that we had ever seen or heard\r\nof.  It is from that museum, I think, that the globe must have been\r\nsupplied with the trees and vines and shrubs that it holds precious.\r\n\r\nThe road is infinitely and charmingly crooked.  It goes winding in and\r\nout under lofty cliffs that are smothered in vines and foliage, and\r\naround the edges of bottomless chasms; and all the way one glides by\r\nfiles of picturesque natives, some carrying burdens up, others going down\r\nfrom their work in the tea-gardens; and once there was a gaudy wedding\r\nprocession, all bright tinsel and color, and a bride, comely and girlish,\r\nwho peeped out from the curtains of her palanquin, exposing her face with\r\nthat pure delight which the young and happy take in sin for sin's own\r\nsake.\r\n\r\nBy and by we were well up in the region of the clouds, and from that\r\nbreezy height we looked down and afar over a wonderful picture--the\r\nPlains of India, stretching to the horizon, soft and fair, level as a\r\nfloor, shimmering with heat, mottled with cloud-shadows, and cloven with\r\nshining rivers.  Immediately below us, and receding down, down, down,\r\ntoward the valley, was a shaven confusion of hilltops, with ribbony roads\r\nand paths squirming and snaking cream-yellow all over them and about\r\nthem, every curve and twist sharply distinct.\r\n\r\nAt an elevation of 6,000 feet we entered a thick cloud, and it shut out\r\nthe world and kept it shut out.  We climbed 1,000 feet higher, then began\r\nto descend, and presently got down to Darjeeling, which is 6,000 feet\r\nabove the level of the Plains.\r\n\r\nWe had passed many a mountain village on the way up, and seen some new\r\nkinds of natives, among them many samples of the fighting Ghurkas.  They\r\nare not large men, but they are strong and resolute.  There are no better\r\nsoldiers among Britain's native troops.  And we had passed shoals of\r\ntheir women climbing the forty miles of steep road from the valley to\r\ntheir mountain homes, with tall baskets on their backs hitched to their\r\nforeheads by a band, and containing a freightage weighing--I will not say\r\nhow many hundreds of pounds, for the sum is unbelievable.  These were\r\nyoung women, and they strode smartly along under these astonishing\r\nburdens with the air of people out for a holiday.  I was told that a\r\nwoman will carry a piano on her back all the way up the mountain; and\r\nthat more than once a woman had done it.  If these were old women I\r\nshould regard the Ghurkas as no more civilized than the Europeans.\r\nAt the railway station at Darjeeling you find plenty of cab-substitutes\r\n--open coffins, in which you sit, and are then borne on men's shoulders\r\nup\r\nthe steep roads into the town.\r\n\r\nUp there we found a fairly comfortable hotel, the property of an\r\nindiscriminate and incoherent landlord, who looks after nothing, but\r\nleaves everything to his army of Indian servants.  No, he does look after\r\nthe bill--to be just to him--and the tourist cannot do better than follow\r\nhis example.  I was told by a resident that the summit of Kinchinjunga is\r\noften hidden in the clouds, and that sometimes a tourist has waited\r\ntwenty-two days and then been obliged to go away without a sight of it.\r\nAnd yet went not disappointed; for when he got his hotel bill he\r\nrecognized that he was now seeing the highest thing in the Himalayas.\r\nBut this is probably a lie.\r\n\r\nAfter lecturing I went to the Club that night, and that was a comfortable\r\nplace.  It is loftily situated, and looks out over a vast spread of\r\nscenery; from it you can see where the boundaries of three countries come\r\ntogether, some thirty miles away; Thibet is one of them, Nepaul another,\r\nand I think Herzegovina was the other.  Apparently, in every town and\r\ncity in India the gentlemen of the British civil and military service\r\nhave a club; sometimes it is a palatial one, always it is pleasant and\r\nhomelike.  The hotels are not always as good as they might be, and the\r\nstranger who has access to the Club is grateful for his privilege and\r\nknows how to value it.\r\n\r\nNext day was Sunday.  Friends came in the gray dawn with horses, and my\r\nparty rode away to a distant point where Kinchinjunga and Mount Everest\r\nshow up best, but I stayed at home for a private view; for it was very\r\ncold, and I was not acquainted with the horses, any way.  I got a pipe\r\nand a few blankets and sat for two hours at the window, and saw the sun\r\ndrive away the veiling gray and touch up the snow-peaks one after another\r\nwith pale pink splashes and delicate washes of gold, and finally flood\r\nthe whole mighty convulsion of snow-mountains with a deluge of rich\r\nsplendors.\r\n\r\nKinchinjunga's peak was but fitfully visible, but in the between times it\r\nwas vividly clear against the sky--away up there in the blue dome more\r\nthan 28,000 feet above sea level--the loftiest land I had ever seen, by\r\n12,000 feet or more.  It was 45 miles away.  Mount Everest is a thousand\r\nfeet higher, but it was not a part of that sea of mountains piled up\r\nthere before me, so I did not see it; but I did not care, because I think\r\nthat mountains that are as high as that are disagreeable.\r\n\r\nI changed from the back to the front of the house and spent the rest of\r\nthe morning there, watching the swarthy strange tribes flock by from\r\ntheir far homes in the Himalayas.  All ages and both sexes were\r\nrepresented, and the breeds were quite new to me, though the costumes of\r\nthe Thibetans made them look a good deal like Chinamen.  The prayer-wheel\r\nwas a frequent feature.  It brought me near to these people, and made\r\nthem seem kinfolk of mine.  Through our preacher we do much of our\r\npraying by proxy.  We do not whirl him around a stick, as they do, but\r\nthat is merely a detail.  The swarm swung briskly by, hour after hour, a\r\nstrange and striking pageant.  It was wasted there, and it seemed a pity.\r\nIt should have been sent streaming through the cities of Europe or\r\nAmerica, to refresh eyes weary of the pale monotonies of the\r\ncircus-pageant.  These people were bound for the bazar, with things to\r\nsell.  We went down there, later, and saw that novel congress of the wild\r\npeoples, and plowed here and there through it, and concluded that it\r\nwould be worth coming from Calcutta to see, even if there were no\r\nKinchinjunga and Everest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nThere are two times in a man's life when he should not speculate: when he\r\ncan't afford it, and when he can.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOn Monday and Tuesday at sunrise we again had fair-to-middling views of\r\nthe stupendous mountains; then, being well cooled off and refreshed, we\r\nwere ready to chance the weather of the lower world once more.\r\n\r\nWe traveled up hill by the regular train five miles to the summit, then\r\nchanged to a little canvas-canopied hand-car for the 35-mile descent.  It\r\nwas the size of a sleigh, it had six seats and was so low that it seemed\r\nto rest on the ground.  It had no engine or other propelling power, and\r\nneeded none to help it fly down those steep inclines.  It only needed a\r\nstrong brake, to modify its flight, and it had that.  There was a story\r\nof a disastrous trip made down the mountain once in this little car by\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, when the car jumped the track and\r\nthrew its passengers over a precipice.  It was not true, but the story\r\nhad value for me, for it made me nervous, and nervousness wakes a person\r\nup and makes him alive and alert, and heightens the thrill of a new and\r\ndoubtful experience.  The car could really jump the track, of course; a\r\npebble on the track, placed there by either accident or malice, at a\r\nsharp curve where one might strike it before the eye could discover it,\r\ncould derail the car and fling it down into India; and the fact that the\r\nlieutenant-governor had escaped was no proof that I would have the same\r\nluck.  And standing there, looking down upon the Indian Empire from the\r\nairy altitude of 7,000 feet, it seemed unpleasantly far, dangerously far,\r\nto be flung from a handcar.\r\n\r\nBut after all, there was but small danger--for me.  What there was, was\r\nfor Mr. Pugh, inspector of a division of the Indian police, in whose\r\ncompany and protection we had come from Calcutta.  He had seen long\r\nservice as an artillery officer, was less nervous than I was, and so he\r\nwas to go ahead of us in a pilot hand-car, with a Ghurka and another\r\nnative; and the plan was that when we should see his car jump over a\r\nprecipice we must put on our break [sp.] and send for another pilot.\r\nIt was a good arrangement.  Also Mr. Barnard, chief engineer of the\r\nmountain-division of the road, was to take personal charge of our car,\r\nand he had been down the mountain in it many a time.\r\n\r\nEverything looked safe.  Indeed, there was but one questionable detail\r\nleft: the regular train was to follow us as soon as we should start, and\r\nit might run over us.  Privately, I thought it would.\r\n\r\nThe road fell sharply down in front of us and went corkscrewing in and\r\nout around the crags and precipices, down, down, forever down, suggesting\r\nnothing so exactly or so uncomfortably as a crooked toboggan slide with\r\nno end to it.  Mr. Pugh waved his flag and started, like an arrow from a\r\nbow, and before I could get out of the car we were gone too.  I had\r\npreviously had but one sensation like the shock of that departure, and\r\nthat was the gaspy shock that took my breath away the first time that I\r\nwas discharged from the summit of a toboggan slide.  But in both\r\ninstances the sensation was pleasurable--intensely so; it was a sudden\r\nand immense exaltation, a mixed ecstasy of deadly fright and unimaginable\r\njoy.  I believe that this combination makes the perfection of human\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nThe pilot car's flight down the mountain suggested the swoop of a swallow\r\nthat is skimming the ground, so swiftly and smoothly and gracefully it\r\nswept down the long straight reaches and soared in and out of the bends\r\nand around the corners.  We raced after it, and seemed to flash by the\r\ncapes and crags with the speed of light; and now and then we almost\r\novertook it--and had hopes; but it was only playing with us; when we got\r\nnear, it released its brake, made a spring around a corner, and the next\r\ntime it spun into view, a few seconds later, it looked as small as a\r\nwheelbarrow, it was so far away.  We played with the train in the same\r\nway.  We often got out to gather flowers or sit on a precipice and look\r\nat the scenery, then presently we would hear a dull and growing roar, and\r\nthe long coils of the train would come into sight behind and above us;\r\nbut we did not need to start till the locomotive was close down upon us\r\n--then we soon left it far behind.  It had to stop at every station,\r\ntherefore it was not an embarrassment to us.  Our brake was a good piece\r\nof machinery; it could bring the car to a standstill on a slope as steep\r\nas a house-roof.\r\n\r\nThe scenery was grand and varied and beautiful, and there was no hurry;\r\nwe could always stop and examine it.  There was abundance of time.  We\r\ndid not need to hamper the train; if it wanted the road, we could switch\r\noff and let it go by, then overtake it and pass it later.  We stopped at\r\none place to see the Gladstone Cliff, a great crag which the ages and the\r\nweather have sculptured into a recognizable portrait of the venerable\r\nstatesman.  Mr. Gladstone is a stockholder in the road, and Nature began\r\nthis portrait ten thousand years ago, with the idea of having the\r\ncompliment ready in time for the event.\r\n\r\nWe saw a banyan tree which sent down supporting stems from branches which\r\nwere sixty feet above the ground.  That is, I suppose it was a banyan;\r\nits bark resembled that of the great banyan in the botanical gardens at\r\nCalcutta, that spider-legged thing with its wilderness of vegetable\r\ncolumns.  And there were frequent glimpses of a totally leafless tree\r\nupon whose innumerable twigs and branches a cloud of crimson butterflies\r\nhad lighted--apparently.  In fact these brilliant red butterflies were\r\nflowers, but the illusion was good.  Afterward in South Africa, I saw\r\nanother splendid effect made by red flowers.  This flower was probably\r\ncalled the torch-plant--should have been so named, anyway.  It had a\r\nslender stem several feet high, and from its top stood up a single tongue\r\nof flame, an intensely red flower of the size and shape of a small\r\ncorn-cob.  The stems stood three or four feet apart all over a great\r\nhill-slope that was a mile long, and make one think of what the Place\r\nde la Concorde would be if its myriad lights were red instead of white\r\nand yellow.\r\n\r\nA few miles down the mountain we stopped half an hour to see a Thibetan\r\ndramatic performance.  It was in the open air on the hillside.  The\r\naudience was composed of Thibetans, Ghurkas, and other unusual people.\r\nThe costumes of the actors were in the last degree outlandish, and the\r\nperformance was in keeping with the clothes.  To an accompaniment of\r\nbarbarous noises the actors stepped out one after another and began to\r\nspin around with immense swiftness and vigor and violence, chanting the\r\nwhile, and soon the whole troupe would be spinning and chanting and\r\nraising the dust.  They were performing an ancient and celebrated\r\nhistorical play, and a Chinaman explained it to me in pidjin English as\r\nit went along.  The play was obscure enough without the explanation; with\r\nthe explanation added, it was (opake).  As a drama this ancient\r\nhistorical work of art was defective, I thought, but as a wild and\r\nbarbarous spectacle the representation was beyond criticism.\r\nFar down the mountain we got out to look at a piece of remarkable\r\nloop-engineering--a spiral where the road curves upon itself with such\r\nabruptness that when the regular train came down and entered the loop, we\r\nstood over it and saw the locomotive disappear under our bridge, then in\r\na few moments appear again, chasing its own tail; and we saw it gain on\r\nit, overtake it, draw ahead past the rear cars, and run a race with that\r\nend of the train.  It was like a snake swallowing itself.\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the mountain we stopped about an hour at Mr. Barnard's\r\nhouse for refreshments, and while we were sitting on the veranda looking\r\nat the distant panorama of hills through a gap in the forest, we came\r\nvery near seeing a leopard kill a calf.--[It killed it the day before.]\r\n--It is a wild place and lovely.  From the woods all about came the songs\r\nof birds,--among them the contributions of a couple of birds which I was\r\nnot then acquainted with: the brain-fever bird and the coppersmith.  The\r\nsong of the brain-fever demon starts on a low but steadily rising key,\r\nand is a spiral twist which augments in intensity and severity with each\r\nadded spiral, growing sharper and sharper, and more and more painful,\r\nmore and more agonizing, more and more maddening, intolerable,\r\nunendurable, as it bores deeper and deeper and deeper into the listener's\r\nbrain, until at last the brain fever comes as a relief and the man dies.\r\nI am bringing some of these birds home to America.  They will be a great\r\ncuriosity there, and it is believed that in our climate they will\r\nmultiply like rabbits.\r\n\r\nThe coppersmith bird's note at a certain distance away has the ring of a\r\nsledge on granite; at a certain other distance the hammering has a more\r\nmetallic ring, and you might think that the bird was mending a copper\r\nkettle; at another distance it has a more woodeny thump, but it is a\r\nthump that is full of energy, and sounds just like starting a bung.  So\r\nhe is a hard bird to name with a single name; he is a stone-breaker,\r\ncoppersmith, and bung-starter, and even then he is not completely named,\r\nfor when he is close by you find that there is a soft, deep, melodious\r\nquality in his thump, and for that no satisfying name occurs to you.  You\r\nwill not mind his other notes, but when he camps near enough for you to\r\nhear that one, you presently find that his measured and monotonous\r\nrepetition of it is beginning to disturb you; next it will weary you,\r\nsoon it will distress you, and before long each thump will hurt your\r\nhead; if this goes on, you will lose your mind with the pain and misery\r\nof it, and go crazy.  I am bringing some of these birds home to America.\r\nThere is nothing like them there.  They will be a great surprise, and it\r\nis said that in a climate like ours they will surpass expectation for\r\nfecundity.\r\n\r\nI am bringing some nightingales, too, and some cue-owls.  I got them in\r\nItaly.  The song of the nightingale is the deadliest known to\r\nornithology.  That demoniacal shriek can kill at thirty yards.  The note\r\nof the cue-owl is infinitely soft and sweet--soft and sweet as the\r\nwhisper of a flute.  But penetrating--oh, beyond belief; it can bore\r\nthrough boiler-iron.  It is a lingering note, and comes in triplets, on\r\nthe one unchanging key: hoo-o-o, hoo-o-o, hoo-o-o; then a silence of\r\nfifteen seconds, then the triplet again; and so on, all night.  At first\r\nit is divine; then less so; then trying; then distressing; then\r\nexcruciating; then agonizing, and at the end of two hours the listener is\r\na maniac.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently we took to the hand-car and went flying down the\r\nmountain again; flying and stopping, flying and stopping, till at last we\r\nwere in the plain once more and stowed for Calcutta in the regular train.\r\nThat was the most enjoyable day I have spent in the earth.  For rousing,\r\ntingling, rapturous pleasure there is no holiday trip that approaches the\r\nbird-flight down the Himalayas in a hand-car.  It has no fault, no\r\nblemish, no lack, except that there are only thirty-five miles of it\r\ninstead of five hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nShe was not quite what you would call refined.  She was not quite what\r\nyou would call unrefined.  She was the kind of person that keeps a\r\nparrot.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am able to judge, nothing has been left undone, either by man\r\nor Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun\r\nvisits on his round.  Nothing seems to have been forgotten, nothing over\r\nlooked.  Always, when you think you have come to the end of her\r\ntremendous specialties and have finished hanging tags upon her as the\r\nLand of the Thug, the Land of the Plague, the Land of Famine, the Land of\r\nGiant Illusions, the Land of Stupendous Mountains, and so forth, another\r\nspecialty crops up and another tag is required.  I have been overlooking\r\nthe fact that India is by an unapproachable supremacy--the Land of\r\nMurderous Wild Creatures.  Perhaps it will be simplest to throw away the\r\ntags and generalize her with one all-comprehensive name, as the Land of\r\nWonders.\r\n\r\nFor many years the British Indian Government has been trying to destroy\r\nthe murderous wild creatures, and has spent a great deal of money in the\r\neffort.  The annual official returns show that the undertaking is a\r\ndifficult one.\r\n\r\nThese returns exhibit a curious annual uniformity in results; the sort of\r\nuniformity which you find in the annual output of suicides in the world's\r\ncapitals, and the proportions of deaths by this, that, and the other\r\ndisease.  You can always come close to foretelling how many suicides will\r\noccur in Paris, London, and New York, next year, and also how many deaths\r\nwill result from cancer, consumption, dog-bite, falling out of the\r\nwindow, getting run over by cabs, etc., if you know the statistics of\r\nthose matters for the present year.  In the same way, with one year's\r\nIndian statistics before you, you can guess closely at how many people\r\nwere killed in that Empire by tigers during the previous year, and the\r\nyear before that, and the year before that, and at how many were killed\r\nin each of those years by bears, how many by wolves, and how many by\r\nsnakes; and you can also guess closely at how many people are going to be\r\nkilled each year for the coming five years by each of those agencies.\r\nYou can also guess closely at how many of each agency the government is\r\ngoing to kill each year for the next five years.\r\n\r\nI have before me statistics covering a period of six consecutive years.\r\nBy these, I know that in India the tiger kills something over 800 persons\r\nevery year, and that the government responds by killing about double as\r\nmany tigers every year.  In four of the six years referred to, the tiger\r\ngot 800 odd; in one of the remaining two years he got only 700, but in\r\nthe other remaining year he made his average good by scoring 917.  He is\r\nalways sure of his average.  Anyone who bets that the tiger will kill\r\n2,400 people in India in any three consecutive years has invested his\r\nmoney in a certainty; anyone who bets that he will kill 2,600 in any\r\nthree consecutive years, is absolutely sure to lose.\r\n\r\nAs strikingly uniform as are the statistics of suicide, they are not any\r\nmore so than are those of the tiger's annual output of slaughtered human\r\nbeings in India.  The government's work is quite uniform, too; it about\r\ndoubles the tiger's average.  In six years the tiger killed 5,000\r\npersons, minus 50; in the same six years 10,000 tigers were killed, minus\r\n400.\r\n\r\nThe wolf kills nearly as many people as the tiger--700 a year to the\r\ntiger's 800 odd--but while he is doing it, more than 5,000 of his tribe\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nThe leopard kills an average of 230 people per year, but loses 3,300 of\r\nhis own mess while he is doing it.\r\n\r\nThe bear kills 100 people per year at a cost of 1,250 of his own tribe.\r\n\r\nThe tiger, as the figures show, makes a very handsome fight against man.\r\nBut it is nothing to the elephant's fight.  The king of beasts, the lord\r\nof the jungle, loses four of his mess per year, but he kills forty--five\r\npersons to make up for it.\r\n\r\nBut when it comes to killing cattle, the lord of the jungle is not\r\ninterested.  He kills but 100 in six years--horses of hunters, no doubt\r\n--but in the same six the tiger kills more than 84,000, the leopard\r\n100,000, the bear 4,000, the wolf 70,000, the hyena more than 13,000,\r\nother wild beasts 27,000, and the snakes 19,000, a grand total of more\r\nthan 300,000; an average of 50,000 head per year.\r\n\r\nIn response, the government kills, in the six years, a total of 3,201,232\r\nwild beasts and snakes.  Ten for one.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the snakes are not much interested in cattle;\r\nthey kill only 3,000 odd per year.  The snakes are much more interested\r\nin man.  India swarms with deadly snakes.  At the head of the list is the\r\ncobra, the deadliest known to the world, a snake whose bite kills where\r\nthe rattlesnake's bite merely entertains.\r\n\r\nIn India, the annual man-killings by snakes are as uniform, as regular,\r\nand as forecastable as are the tiger-average and the suicide-average.\r\nAnyone who bets that in India, in any three consecutive years the snakes\r\nwill kill 49,500 persons, will win his bet; and anyone who bets that in\r\nIndia in any three consecutive years, the snakes will kill 53,500\r\npersons, will lose his bet.  In India the snakes kill 17,000 people a\r\nyear; they hardly ever fall short of it; they as seldom exceed it.  An\r\ninsurance actuary could take the Indian census tables and the\r\ngovernment's snake tables and tell you within sixpence how much it would\r\nbe worth to insure a man against death by snake-bite there.  If I had a\r\ndollar for every person killed per year in India, I would rather have it\r\nthan any other property, as it is the only property in the world not\r\nsubject to shrinkage.\r\n\r\nI should like to have a royalty on the government-end of the snake\r\nbusiness, too, and am in London now trying to get it; but when I get it\r\nit is not going to be as regular an income as the other will be if I get\r\nthat; I have applied for it.  The snakes transact their end of the\r\nbusiness in a more orderly and systematic way than the government\r\ntransacts its end of it, because the snakes have had a long experience\r\nand know all about the traffic.  You can make sure that the government\r\nwill never kill fewer than 110,000 snakes in a year, and that it will\r\nnewer quite reach 300,000--too much room for oscillation; good\r\nspeculative stock, to bear or bull, and buy and sell long and short, and\r\nall that kind of thing, but not eligible for investment like the other.\r\nThe man that speculates in the government's snake crop wants to go\r\ncarefully.  I would not advise a man to buy a single crop at all--I mean\r\na crop of futures for the possible wobble is something quite\r\nextraordinary.  If he can buy six future crops in a bunch, seller to\r\ndeliver 1,500,000 altogether, that is another matter.  I do not know what\r\nsnakes are worth now, but I know what they would be worth then, for the\r\nstatistics show that the seller could not come within 427,000 of carrying\r\nout his contract.  However, I think that a person who speculates in\r\nsnakes is a fool, anyway.  He always regrets it afterwards.\r\n\r\nTo finish the statistics.  In six years the wild beasts kill 20,000\r\npersons, and the snakes kill 103,000.  In the same six the government\r\nkills 1,073,546 snakes.  Plenty left.\r\n\r\nThere are narrow escapes in India.  In the very jungle where I killed\r\nsixteen tigers and all those elephants, a cobra bit me but it got well;\r\neveryone was surprised.  This could not happen twice in ten years,\r\nperhaps.  Usually death would result in fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nWe struck out westward or northwestward from Calcutta on an itinerary of\r\na zig-zag sort, which would in the course of time carry us across India\r\nto its northwestern corner and the border of Afghanistan.  The first part\r\nof the trip carried us through a great region which was an endless\r\ngarden--miles and miles of the beautiful flower from whose juices comes\r\nthe opium, and at Muzaffurpore we were in the midst of the indigo\r\nculture; thence by a branch road to the Ganges at a point near Dinapore,\r\nand by a train which would have missed the connection by a week but for\r\nthe thoughtfulness of some British officers who were along, and who knew\r\nthe ways of trains that are run by natives without white supervision.\r\nThis train stopped at every village; for no purpose connected with\r\nbusiness, apparently.  We put out nothing, we took nothing aboard.  The\r\ntrain bands stepped ashore and gossiped with friends a quarter of an\r\nhour, then pulled out and repeated this at the succeeding villages.  We\r\nhad thirty-five miles to go and six hours to do it in, but it was plain\r\nthat we were not going to make it.  It was then that the English officers\r\nsaid it was now necessary to turn this gravel train into an express.  So\r\nthey gave the engine-driver a rupee and told him to fly.  It was a simple\r\nremedy.  After that we made ninety miles an hour.  We crossed the Ganges\r\njust at dawn, made our connection, and went to Benares, where we stayed\r\ntwenty-four hours and inspected that strange and fascinating piety-hive\r\nagain; then left for Lucknow, a city which is perhaps the most\r\nconspicuous of the many monuments of British fortitude and valor that are\r\nscattered about the earth.\r\n\r\nThe heat was pitiless, the flat plains were destitute of grass, and baked\r\ndry by the sun they were the color of pale dust, which was flying in\r\nclouds.  But it was much hotter than this when the relieving forces\r\nmarched to Lucknow in the time of the Mutiny.  Those were the days of 138\r\ndeg. in the shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER, LVIII.\r\n\r\nMake it a point to do something every day that you don't want to do.\r\nThis is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty\r\nwithout pain.\r\n                             --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be settled, now, that among the many causes from which the\r\nGreat Mutiny sprang, the main one was the annexation of the kingdom of\r\nOudh by the East India Company--characterized by Sir Henry Lawrence as\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe most unrighteous act that was ever committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the spring of\r\n1857, a mutinous spirit was observable in many of the native garrisons,\r\nand it grew day by day and spread wider and wider.  The younger military\r\nmen saw something very serious in it, and would have liked to take hold\r\nof it vigorously and stamp it out promptly; but they were not in\r\nauthority. Old men were in the high places of the army--men who should\r\nhave been retired long before, because of their great age--and they\r\nregarded the matter as a thing of no consequence.  They loved their\r\nnative soldiers, and would not believe that anything could move them to\r\nrevolt.  Everywhere these obstinate veterans listened serenely to the\r\nrumbling of the volcanoes under them, and said it was nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd so the propagators of mutiny had everything their own way.  They\r\nmoved from camp to camp undisturbed, and painted to the native soldier\r\nthe wrongs his people were suffering at the hands of the English, and\r\nmade his heart burn for revenge.  They were able to point to two facts of\r\nformidable value as backers of their persuasions: In Clive's day, native\r\narmies were incoherent mobs, and without effective arms; therefore, they\r\nwere weak against Clive's organized handful of well-armed men, but the\r\nthing was the other way, now.  The British forces were native; they had\r\nbeen trained by the British, organized by the British, armed by the\r\nBritish, all the power was in their hands--they were a club made by\r\nBritish hands to beat out British brains with.  There was nothing to\r\noppose their mass, nothing but a few weak battalions of British soldiers\r\nscattered about India, a force not worth speaking of.  This argument,\r\ntaken alone, might not have succeeded, for the bravest and best Indian\r\ntroops had a wholesome dread of the white soldier, whether he was weak or\r\nstrong; but the agitators backed it with their second and best point--\r\nprophecy--a prophecy a hundred years old.  The Indian is open to prophecy\r\nat all times; argument may fail to convince him, but not prophecy.  There\r\nwas a prophecy that a hundred years from the year of that battle of\r\nClive's which founded the British Indian Empire, the British power would\r\nbe overthrown and swept away by the natives.\r\n\r\nThe Mutiny broke out at Meerut on the 10th of May, 1857, and fired a\r\ntrain of tremendous historical explosions.  Nana Sahib's massacre of the\r\nsurrendered garrison of Cawnpore occurred in June, and the long siege of\r\nLucknow began.  The military history of England is old and great, but I\r\nthink it must be granted that the crushing of the Mutiny is the greatest\r\nchapter in it.  The British were caught asleep and unprepared.  They were\r\na few thousands, swallowed up in an ocean of hostile populations.  It\r\nwould take months to inform England and get help, but they did not falter\r\nor stop to count the odds, but with English resolution and English\r\ndevotion they took up their task, and went stubbornly on with it, through\r\ngood fortune and bad, and fought the most unpromising fight that one may\r\nread of in fiction or out of it, and won it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe Mutiny broke out so suddenly, and spread with such rapidity that\r\nthere was but little time for occupants of weak outlying stations to\r\nescape to places of safety.  Attempts were made, of course, but they were\r\nattended by hardships as bitter as death in the few cases which were\r\nsuccessful; for the heat ranged between 120 and 138 in the shade; the way\r\nled through hostile peoples, and food and water were hardly to be had.\r\nFor ladies and children accustomed to ease and comfort and plenty, such a\r\njourney must have been a cruel experience.  Sir G. O.  Trevelyan quotes\r\nan example:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what befell Mrs. M----, the wife of the surgeon at a\r\n     certain station on the southern confines of the insurrection.  'I\r\n     heard,' she says, 'a number of shots fired, and, looking out, I saw\r\n     my husband driving furiously from the mess-house, waving his whip.\r\n     I ran to him, and, seeing a bearer with my child in his arms, I\r\n     caught her up, and got into the buggy.  At the mess-house we found\r\n     all the officers assembled, together with sixty sepoys, who had\r\n     remained faithful.  We went off in one large party, amidst a general\r\n     conflagration of our late homes.  We reached the caravanserai at\r\n     Chattapore the next morning, and thence started for Callinger.  At\r\n     this point our sepoy escort deserted us.  We were fired upon by\r\n     match-lockmen, and one officer was shot dead.  We heard, likewise,\r\n     that the people had risen at Callinger, so we returned and walked\r\n     back ten miles that day.  M---- and I carried the child alternately.\r\n     Presently Mrs. Smalley died of sunstroke.  We had no food amongst\r\n     us.  An officer kindly lent us a horse.  We were very faint.  The\r\n     Major died, and was buried; also the Sergeant-major and some women.\r\n     The bandsmen left us on the nineteenth of June.  We were fired at\r\n     again by match-lockmen, and changed direction for Allahabad.  Our\r\n     party consisted of nine gentlemen, two children, the sergeant and\r\n     his wife.  On the morning of the twentieth, Captain Scott took\r\n     Lottie on to his horse.  I was riding behind my husband, and she was\r\n     so crushed between us.  She was two years old on the first of the\r\n     month.  We were both weak through want of food and the effect of the\r\n     sun.  Lottie and I had no head covering.  M---- had a sepoy's cap I\r\n     found on the ground.  Soon after sunrise we were followed by\r\n     villagers armed with clubs and spears.  One of them struck Captain\r\n     Scott's horse on the leg.  He galloped off with Lottie, and my poor\r\n     husband never saw his child again.  We rode on several miles,\r\n     keeping away from villages, and then crossed the river.  Our thirst\r\n     was extreme.  M---- had dreadful cramps, so that I had to hold him\r\n     on the horse.  I was very uneasy about him.  The day before I saw\r\n     the drummer's wife eating chupatties, and asked her to give a piece\r\n     to the child, which she did.  I now saw water in a ravine.  The\r\n     descent was steep, and our only drinking-vessel was M----'s cap.\r\n\tOur horse got water, and I bathed my neck.  I had no stockings, and\r\n     my feet were torn and blistered.  Two peasants came in sight, and we\r\n     were frightened and rode off.  The sergeant held our horse, and\r\n     M---- put me up and mounted.  I think he must have got suddenly\r\nfaint for I fell and he over me, on the road, when the horse started off.\r\n     Some time before he said, and Barber, too, that he could not live\r\n     many hours.  I felt he was dying before we came to the ravine.  He\r\n     told me his wishes about his children and myself, and took leave.\r\n     My brain seemed burnt up.  No tears came.  As soon as we fell, the\r\n     sergeant let go the horse, and it went off; so that escape was cut\r\n     off.  We sat down on the ground waiting for death.  Poor fellow! he\r\n     was very weak; his thirst was frightful, and I went to get him\r\n     water.  Some villagers came, and took my rupees and watch.  I took\r\n     off my wedding-ring, and twisted it in my hair, and replaced the\r\n     guard.  I tore off the skirt of my dress to bring water in, but was\r\n     no use, for when I returned my beloved's eyes were fixed, and,\r\n     though I called and tried to restore him, and poured water into his\r\n     mouth, it only rattled in his throat.  He never spoke to me again.\r\n     I held him in my arms till he sank gradually down.  I felt frantic,\r\n     but could not cry.  I was alone.  I bound his head and face in my\r\n     dress, for there was no earth to bury him.  The pain in my hands and\r\n     feet was dreadful.  I went down to the ravine, and sat in the water\r\n     on a stone, hoping to get off at night and look for Lottie.  When I\r\n     came back from the water, I saw that they had not taken her little\r\n     watch, chain, and seals, so I tied them under my petticoat.  In an\r\n     hour, about thirty villagers came, they dragged me out of the\r\n     ravine, and took off my jacket, and found the little chain.  They\r\n     then dragged me to a village, mocking me all the way, and disputing\r\n     as to whom I was to belong to.  The whole population came to look at\r\n     me.  I asked for a bedstead, and lay down outside the door of a hut.\r\n     They had a dozen of cows, and yet refused me milk.  When night came,\r\n     and the village was quiet, some old woman brought me a leafful of\r\n     rice.  I was too parched to eat, and they gave me water.  The\r\n     morning after a neighboring Rajah sent a palanquin and a horseman to\r\n     fetch me, who told me that a little child and three Sahibs had come\r\n     to his master's house.  And so the poor mother found her lost one,\r\n     'greatly blistered,' poor little creature.  It is not for Europeans\r\n     in India to pray that their flight be not in the winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the first days of June the aged general, Sir Hugh Wheeler commanding\r\nthe forces at Cawnpore, was deserted by his native troops; then he moved\r\nout of the fort and into an exposed patch of open flat ground and built a\r\nfour-foot mud wall around it.  He had with him a few hundred white\r\nsoldiers and officers, and apparently more women and children than\r\nsoldiers.  He was short of provisions, short of arms, short of\r\nammunition, short of military wisdom, short of everything but courage and\r\ndevotion to duty.  The defense of that open lot through twenty-one days\r\nand nights of hunger, thirst, Indian heat, and a never-ceasing storm of\r\nbullets, bombs, and cannon-balls--a defense conducted, not by the aged\r\nand infirm general, but by a young officer named Moore--is one of the\r\nmost heroic episodes in history.  When at last the Nana found it\r\nimpossible to conquer these starving men and women with powder and ball,\r\nhe resorted to treachery, and that succeeded.  He agreed to supply them\r\nwith food and send them to Allahabad in boats.  Their mud wall and their\r\nbarracks were in ruins, their provisions were at the point of exhaustion,\r\nthey had done all that the brave could do, they had conquered an\r\nhonorable compromise,--their forces had been fearfully reduced by\r\ncasualties and by disease, they were not able to continue the contest\r\nlonger.  They came forth helpless but suspecting no treachery, the Nana's\r\nhost closed around them, and at a signal from a trumpet the massacre\r\nbegan.  About two hundred women and children were spared--for the\r\npresent--but all the men except three or four were killed.  Among the\r\nincidents of the massacre quoted by Sir G. O. Trevelyan, is this:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhen, after the lapse of some twenty minutes, the dead began to\r\n     outnumber the living;--when the fire slackened, as the marks grew\r\n     few and far between; then the troopers who had been drawn up to the\r\n     right of the temple plunged into the river, sabre between teeth, and\r\n     pistol in hand.  Thereupon two half-caste Christian women, the wives\r\n     of musicians in the band of the Fifty-sixth, witnessed a scene which\r\n     should not be related at second-hand.  'In the boat where I was to\r\n     have gone,' says Mrs. Bradshaw, confirmed throughout by Mrs. Setts,\r\n     'was the school-mistress and twenty-two misses.  General Wheeler\r\n     came last in a palkee.  They carried him into the water near the\r\n     boat.  I stood close by.  He said, 'Carry me a little further\r\n     towards the boat.' But a trooper said, 'No, get out here.'  As the\r\n     General got out of the palkee, head-foremost, the trooper gave him a\r\n     cut with his sword into the neck, and he fell into the water.  My\r\n     son was killed near him.  I saw it; alas! alas!  Some were stabbed\r\n     with bayonets; others cut down.  Little infants were torn in pieces.\r\n     We saw it; we did; and tell you only what we saw.  Other children\r\n     were stabbed and thrown into the river.  The schoolgirls were burnt\r\n     to death.  I saw their clothes and hair catch fire.  In the water, a\r\n     few paces off, by the next boat, we saw the youngest daughter of\r\n     Colonel Williams.  A sepoy was going to kill her with his bayonet.\r\n     She said, 'My father was always kind to sepoys.'  He turned away,\r\n     and just then a villager struck her on the head with a club, and she\r\n     fell into the water.  These people likewise saw good Mr. Moncrieff,\r\n     the clergyman, take a book from his pocket that he never had leisure\r\n     to open, and heard him commence a prayer for mercy which he was not\r\n     permitted to conclude.  Another deponent observed an European making\r\n     for a drain like a scared water-rat, when some boatmen, armed with\r\n     cudgels, cut off his retreat, and beat him down dead into the mud.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe women and children who had been reserved from the massacre were\r\nimprisoned during a fortnight in a small building, one story high--a\r\ncramped place, a slightly modified Black Hole of Calcutta.  They were\r\nwaiting in suspense; there was none who could forecast their fate.\r\nMeantime the news of the massacre had traveled far and an army of\r\nrescuers with Havelock at its head was on its way--at least an army which\r\nhoped to be rescuers.  It was crossing the country by forced marches, and\r\nstrewing its way with its own dead--men struck down by cholera, and by a\r\nheat which reached 135 deg.  It was in a vengeful fury, and it stopped\r\nfor nothing--neither heat, nor fatigue, nor disease, nor human\r\nopposition.\r\nIt tore its impetuous way through hostile forces, winning victory after\r\nvictory, but still striding on and on, not halting to count results.  And\r\nat last, after this extraordinary march, it arrived before the walls of\r\nCawnpore, met the Nana's massed strength, delivered a crushing defeat,\r\nand entered.\r\n\r\nBut too late--only a few hours too late.  For at the last moment the Nana\r\nhad decided upon the massacre of the captive women and children, and had\r\ncommissioned three Mohammedans and two Hindoos to do the work.  Sir G.\r\nO. Trevelyan says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThereupon the five men entered.  It was the short gloaming of\r\n     Hindostan--the hour when ladies take their evening drive.  She who\r\n     had accosted the officer was standing in the doorway.  With her were\r\n     the native doctor and two Hindoo menials.  That much of the business\r\n     might be seen from the veranda, but all else was concealed amidst\r\n     the interior gloom.  Shrieks and scuffling acquainted those without\r\n     that the journeymen were earning their hire.  Survur Khan soon\r\n     emerged with his sword broken off at the hilt.  He procured another\r\n     from the Nana's house, and a few minutes after appeared again on the\r\n     same errand.  The third blade was of better temper; or perhaps the\r\n     thick of the work was already over.  By the time darkness had closed\r\n     in, the men came forth and locked up the house for the night.  Then\r\n     the screams ceased, but the groans lasted till morning.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe sun rose as usual.  When he had been up nearly three hours the\r\n     five repaired to the scene of their labors over night.  They were\r\n     attended by a few sweepers, who proceeded to transfer the contents\r\n     of the house to a dry well situated behind some trees which grew\r\n     hard by.  'The bodies,' says one who was present throughout, 'were\r\n     dragged out, most of them by the hair of the head.  Those who had\r\n     clothing worth taking were stripped.  Some of the women were alive.\r\n     I cannot say how many; but three could speak.  They prayed for the\r\n     sake of God that an end might be put to their sufferings.  I\r\n     remarked one very stout woman, a half-caste, who was severely\r\n     wounded in both arms, who entreated to be killed.  She and two or\r\n     three others were placed against the bank of the cut by which\r\n     bullocks go down in drawing water.  The dead were first thrown in.\r\n     Yes: there was a great crowd looking on; they were standing along\r\n     the walls of the compound.  They were principally city people and\r\n     villagers.  Yes: there were also sepoys.  Three boys were alive.\r\n     They were fair children.  The eldest, I think, must have been six or\r\n     seven, and the youngest five years.  They were running around the\r\n     well (where else could they go to?), and there was none to save\r\n     them.  No: none said a word or tried to save them.'\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt length the smallest of them made an infantile attempt to get\r\n     away.  The little thing had been frightened past bearing by the\r\n     murder of one of the surviving ladies.  He thus attracted the\r\n     observation of a native who flung him and his companions down the\r\n     well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe soldiers had made a march of eighteen days, almost without rest, to\r\nsave the women and the children, and now they were too late--all were\r\ndead and the assassin had flown.  What happened then, Trevelyan hesitated\r\nto put into words.  \xe2\x80\x9cOf what took place, the less said is the better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he continues:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cBut there was a spectacle to witness which might excuse much.\r\n     Those who, straight from the contested field, wandered sobbing\r\n     through the rooms of the ladies' house, saw what it were well could\r\n     the outraged earth have straightway hidden.  The inner apartment was\r\n     ankle-deep in blood.  The plaster was scored with sword-cuts; not\r\n     high up as where men have fought, but low down, and about the\r\n     corners, as if a creature had crouched to avoid the blow.  Strips of\r\n     dresses, vainly tied around the handles of the doors, signified the\r\n     contrivance to which feminine despair had resorted as a means of\r\n     keeping out the murderers.  Broken combs were there, and the frills\r\n     of children's trousers, and torn cuffs and pinafores, and little\r\n     round hats, and one or two shoes with burst latchets, and one or two\r\n     daguerreotype cases with cracked glasses.  An officer picked up a\r\n     few curls, preserved in a bit of cardboard, and marked 'Ned's hair,\r\n     with love'; but around were strewn locks, some near a yard in\r\n     length, dissevered, not as a keepsake, by quite other scissors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe battle of Waterloo was fought on the 18th of June, 1815.  I do not\r\nstate this fact as a reminder to the reader, but as news to him.  For a\r\nforgotten fact is news when it comes again.  Writers of books have the\r\nfashion of whizzing by vast and renowned historical events with the\r\nremark, \xe2\x80\x9cThe details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to the\r\nreader to need repeating here.\xe2\x80\x9d  They know that that is not true.  It is\r\na low kind of flattery.  They know that the reader has forgotten every\r\ndetail of it, and that nothing of the tremendous event is left in his\r\nmind but a vague and formless luminous smudge.  Aside from the desire to\r\nflatter the reader, they have another reason for making the remark-two\r\nreasons, indeed.  They do not remember the details themselves, and do not\r\nwant the trouble of hunting them up and copying them out; also, they are\r\nafraid that if they search them out and print them they will be scoffed\r\nat by the book-reviewers for retelling those worn old things which are\r\nfamiliar to everybody.  They should not mind the reviewer's jeer; he\r\ndoesn't remember any of the worn old things until the book which he is\r\nreviewing has retold them to him.\r\n\r\nI have made the quoted remark myself, at one time and another, but I was\r\nnot doing it to flatter the reader; I was merely doing it to save work.\r\nIf I had known the details without brushing up, I would have put them in;\r\nbut I didn't, and I did not want the labor of posting myself; so I said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to the reader to\r\nneed repeating here.\xe2\x80\x9d  I do not like that kind of a lie; still, it does\r\nsave work.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to get out of repeating the details of the Siege of\r\nLucknow in fear of the reviewer; I am not leaving them out in fear that\r\nthey would not interest the reader; I am leaving them out partly to save\r\nwork; mainly for lack of room.  It is a pity, too; for there is not a\r\ndull place anywhere in the great story.\r\n\r\nTen days before the outbreak (May 10th) of the Mutiny, all was serene at\r\nLucknow, the huge capital of Oudh, the kingdom which had recently been\r\nseized by the India Company.  There was a great garrison, composed of\r\nabout 7,000 native troops and between 700 and 800 whites.  These white\r\nsoldiers and their families were probably the only people of their race\r\nthere; at their elbow was that swarming population of warlike natives, a\r\nrace of born soldiers, brave, daring, and fond of fighting.  On high\r\nground just outside the city stood the palace of that great personage,\r\nthe Resident, the representative of British power and authority.  It\r\nstood in the midst of spacious grounds, with its due complement of\r\noutbuildings, and the grounds were enclosed by a wall--a wall not for\r\ndefense, but for privacy.  The mutinous spirit was in the air, but the\r\nwhites were not afraid, and did not feel much troubled.\r\n\r\nThen came the outbreak at Meerut, then the capture of Delhi by the\r\nmutineers; in June came the three-weeks leaguer of Sir Hugh Wheeler in\r\nhis open lot at Cawnpore--40 miles distant from Lucknow--then the\r\ntreacherous massacre of that gallant little garrison; and now the great\r\nrevolt was in full flower, and the comfortable condition of things at\r\nLucknow was instantly changed.\r\n\r\nThere was an outbreak there, and Sir Henry Lawrence marched out of the\r\nResidency on the 30th of June to put it down, but was defeated with heavy\r\nloss, and had difficulty in getting back again.  That night the memorable\r\nsiege of the Residency--called the siege of Lucknow--began.  Sir Henry\r\nwas killed three days later, and Brigadier Inglis succeeded him in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nOutside of the Residency fence was an immense host of hostile and\r\nconfident native besiegers; inside it were 480 loyal native soldiers, 730\r\nwhite ones, and 500 women and children.\r\n\r\nIn those days the English garrisons always managed to hamper themselves\r\nsufficiently with women and children.\r\n\r\nThe natives established themselves in houses close at hand and began to\r\nrain bullets and cannon-balls into the Residency; and this they kept up,\r\nnight and day, during four months and a half, the little garrison\r\nindustriously replying all the time.  The women and children soon became\r\nso used to the roar of the guns that it ceased to disturb their sleep.\r\nThe children imitated siege and defense in their play.  The women--with\r\nany pretext, or with none--would sally out into the storm-swept grounds.\r\nThe defense was kept up week after week, with stubborn fortitude, in the\r\nmidst of death, which came in many forms--by bullet, small-pox, cholera,\r\nand by various diseases induced by unpalatable and insufficient food, by\r\nthe long hours of wearying and exhausting overwork in the daily and\r\nnightly battle in the oppressive Indian heat, and by the broken rest\r\ncaused by the intolerable pest of mosquitoes, flies, mice, rats, and\r\nfleas.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after the beginning of the siege more than one-half of the\r\noriginal force of white soldiers was dead, and close upon three-fifths of\r\nthe original native force.\r\n\r\nBut the fighting went on just the same.  The enemy mined, the English\r\ncounter-mined, and, turn about, they blew up each other's posts.  The\r\nResidency grounds were honey-combed with the enemy's tunnels.  Deadly\r\ncourtesies were constantly exchanged--sorties by the English in the\r\nnight; rushes by the enemy in the night--rushes whose purpose was to\r\nbreach the walls or scale them; rushes which cost heavily, and always\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nThe ladies got used to all the horrors of war--the shrieks of mutilated\r\nmen, the sight of blood and death.  Lady Inglis makes this mention in her\r\ndiary:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Bruere's nurse was carried past our door to-day, wounded in\r\n     the eye.  To extract the bullet it was found necessary to take out\r\n     the eye--a fearful operation.  Her mistress held her while it was\r\n     performed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe first relieving force failed to relieve.  It was under Havelock and\r\nOutram; and arrived when the siege had been going on for three months.\r\nIt fought its desperate way to Lucknow, then fought its way through the\r\ncity against odds of a hundred to one, and entered the Residency; but\r\nthere was not enough left of it, then, to do any good.  It lost more men\r\nin its last fight than it found in the Residency when it got in.  It\r\nbecame captive itself.\r\n\r\nThe fighting and starving and dying by bullets and disease went steadily\r\non.  Both sides fought with energy and industry.  Captain Birch puts this\r\nstriking incident in evidence.  He is speaking of the third month of the\r\nsiege:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAs an instance of the heavy firing brought to bear on our position\r\n     this month may be mentioned the cutting down of the upper story of a\r\n     brick building simply by musketry firing.  This building was in a\r\n     most exposed position.  All the shots which just missed the top of\r\n     the rampart cut into the dead wall pretty much in a straight line,\r\n     and at length cut right through and brought the upper story tumbling\r\n     down.  The upper structure on the top of the brigade-mess also fell\r\n     in.  The Residency house was a wreck.  Captain Anderson's post had\r\n     long ago been knocked down, and Innes' post also fell in.  These two\r\n     were riddled with round shot.  As many as 200 were picked up by\r\n     Colonel Masters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe exhausted garrison fought doggedly on all through the next month--\r\nOctober.  Then, November 2d, news came Sir Colin Campbell's relieving\r\nforce would soon be on its way from Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th the boom of his guns was heard.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th the sounds came nearer--he was slowly, but steadily, cutting\r\nhis way through, storming one stronghold after another.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th he captured the Martiniere College, and ran up the British\r\nflag there.  It was seen from the Residency.\r\n\r\nNext he took the Dilkoosha.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th he took the former mess-house of the 32d regiment--a\r\nfortified building, and very strong.  \xe2\x80\x9cA most exciting, anxious day,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n writes Lady Inglis in her diary.  \xe2\x80\x9cAbout 4 P.M., two strange officers\r\nwalked through our yard, leading their horses\xe2\x80\x9d--and by that sign she knew\r\nthat communication was established between the forces, that the relief\r\nwas real, this time, and that the long siege of Lucknow was ended.\r\n\r\nThe last eight or ten miles of Sir Colin Campbell's march was through\r\nseas of blood.  The weapon mainly used was the bayonet, the fighting was\r\ndesperate.  The way was mile-stoned with detached strong buildings of\r\nstone, fortified, and heavily garrisoned, and these had to be taken by\r\nassault.  Neither side asked for quarter, and neither gave it.  At the\r\nSecundrabagh, where nearly two thousand of the enemy occupied a great\r\nstone house in a garden, the work of slaughter was continued until every\r\nman was killed.  That is a sample of the character of that devastating\r\nmarch.\r\n\r\nThere were but few trees in the plain at that time, and from the\r\nResidency the progress of the march, step by step, victory by victory,\r\ncould be noted; the ascending clouds of battle-smoke marked the way to\r\nthe eye, and the thunder of the guns marked it to the ear.\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell had not come to Lucknow to hold it, but to save the\r\noccupants of the Residency, and bring them away.  Four or five days after\r\nhis arrival the secret evacuation by the troops took place, in the middle\r\nof a dark night, by the principal gate, (the Bailie Guard).  The two\r\nhundred women and two hundred and fifty children had been previously\r\nremoved.  Captain Birch says:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now commenced a movement of the most perfect arrangement and\r\n     successful generalship--the withdrawal of the whole of the various\r\n     forces, a combined movement requiring the greatest care and skill.\r\n     First, the garrison in immediate contact with the enemy at the\r\n     furthest extremity of the Residency position was marched out.  Every\r\n     other garrison in turn fell in behind it, and so passed out through\r\n     the Bailie Guard gate, till the whole of our position was evacuated.\r\n     Then Havelock's force was similarly withdrawn, post by post,\r\n     marching in rear of our garrison.  After them in turn came the\r\n     forces of the Commander-in-Chief, which joined on in the rear of\r\n     Havelock's force.  Regiment by regiment was withdrawn with the\r\n     utmost order and regularity.  The whole operation resembled the\r\n     movement of a telescope.  Stern silence was kept, and the enemy took\r\n     no alarm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLady Inglis, referring to her husband and to General Sir James Outram,\r\nsets down the closing detail of this impressive midnight retreat, in\r\ndarkness and by stealth, of this shadowy host through the gate which it\r\nhad defended so long and so well:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAt twelve precisely they marched out, John and Sir James Outram\r\n     remaining till all had passed, and then they took off their hats to\r\n     the Bailie Guard, the scene of as noble a defense as I think history\r\n     will ever have to relate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nDon't part with your illusions.  When they are gone you may still exist\r\nbut you have ceased to live.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nOften, the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the strict\r\ntruth.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWe were driven over Sir Colin Campbell's route by a British officer, and\r\nwhen I arrived at the Residency I was so familiar with the road that I\r\ncould have led a retreat over it myself; but the compass in my head has\r\nbeen out of order from my birth, and so, as soon as I was within the\r\nbattered Bailie Guard and turned about to review the march and imagine\r\nthe relieving forces storming their way along it, everything was upside\r\ndown and wrong end first in a moment, and I was never able to get\r\nstraightened out again.  And now, when I look at the battle-plan, the\r\nconfusion remains.  In me the east was born west, the battle-plans which\r\nhave the east on the right-hand side are of no use to me.\r\n\r\nThe Residency ruins are draped with flowering vines, and are impressive\r\nand beautiful.  They and the grounds are sacred now, and will suffer no\r\nneglect nor be profaned by any sordid or commercial use while the British\r\nremain masters of India.  Within the grounds are buried the dead who gave\r\nup their lives there in the long siege.\r\n\r\nAfter a fashion, I was able to imagine the fiery storm that raged night\r\nand day over the place during so many months, and after a fashion I could\r\nimagine the men moving through it, but I could not satisfactorily place\r\nthe 200 women, and I could do nothing at all with the 250 children.  I\r\nknew by Lady Inglis' diary that the children carried on their small\r\naffairs very much as if blood and carnage and the crash and thunder of a\r\nsiege were natural and proper features of nursery life, and I tried to\r\nrealize it; but when her little Johnny came rushing, all excitement,\r\nthrough the din and smoke, shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, mamma, the white hen has laid\r\nan egg!\xe2\x80\x9d  I saw that I could not do it.  Johnny's place was under the\r\nbed.  I could imagine him there, because I could imagine myself there;\r\nand I think I should not have been interested in a hen that was laying an\r\negg; my interest would have been with the parties that were laying the\r\nbombshells.  I sat at dinner with one of those children in the Club's\r\nIndian palace, and I knew that all through the siege he was perfecting\r\nhis teething and learning to talk; and while to me he was the most\r\nimpressive object in Lucknow after the Residency ruins, I was not able to\r\nimagine what his life had been during that tempestuous infancy of his,\r\nnor what sort of a curious surprise it must have been to him to be\r\nmarched suddenly out into a strange dumb world where there wasn't any\r\nnoise, and nothing going on.  He was only forty-one when I saw him, a\r\nstrangely youthful link to connect the present with so ancient an episode\r\nas the Great Mutiny.\r\n\r\nBy and by we saw Cawnpore, and the open lot which was the scene of\r\nMoore's memorable defense, and the spot on the shore of the Ganges where\r\nthe massacre of the betrayed garrison occurred, and the small Indian\r\ntemple whence the bugle-signal notified the assassins to fall on.  This\r\nlatter was a lonely spot, and silent.  The sluggish river drifted by,\r\nalmost currentless.  It was dead low water, narrow channels with vast\r\nsandbars between, all the way across the wide bed; and the only living\r\nthing in sight was that grotesque and solemn bald-headed bird, the\r\nAdjutant, standing on his six-foot stilts, solitary on a distant bar,\r\nwith his head sunk between his shoulders, thinking; thinking of his\r\nprize, I suppose--the dead Hindoo that lay awash at his feet, and whether\r\nto eat him alone or invite friends.  He and his prey were a proper accent\r\nto that mournful place.  They were in keeping with it, they emphasized\r\nits loneliness and its solemnity.\r\n\r\nAnd we saw the scene of the slaughter of the helpless women and children,\r\nand also the costly memorial that is built over the well which contains\r\ntheir remains.  The Black Hole of Calcutta is gone, but a more reverent\r\nage is come, and whatever remembrancer still exists of the moving and\r\nheroic sufferings and achievements of the garrisons of Lucknow and\r\nCawnpore will be guarded and preserved.\r\n\r\nIn Agra and its neighborhood, and afterwards at Delhi, we saw forts,\r\nmosques, and tombs, which were built in the great days of the Mohammedan\r\nemperors, and which are marvels of cost, magnitude, and richness of\r\nmaterials and ornamentation, creations of surpassing grandeur, wonders\r\nwhich do indeed make the like things in the rest of the world seem tame\r\nand inconsequential by comparison.  I am not purposing to describe them.\r\nBy good fortune I had not read too much about them, and therefore was\r\nable to get a natural and rational focus upon them, with the result that\r\nthey thrilled, blessed, and exalted me.  But if I had previously\r\noverheated my imagination by drinking too much pestilential literary hot\r\nScotch, I should have suffered disappointment and sorrow.\r\n\r\nI mean to speak of only one of these many world-renowned buildings, the\r\nTaj Mahal, the most celebrated construction in the earth.  I had read a\r\ngreat deal too much about it.  I saw it in the daytime, I saw it in the\r\nmoonlight, I saw it near at hand, I saw it from a distance; and I knew\r\nall the time, that of its kind it was the wonder of THE world, with no\r\ncompetitor now and no possible future competitor; and yet, it was not MY\r\nTaj.  My Taj had been built by excitable literary people; it was solidly\r\nlodged in my head, and I could not blast it out.\r\n\r\nI wish to place before the reader some of the usual descriptions of the\r\nTaj, and ask him to take note of the impressions left in his mind.  These\r\ndescriptions do really state the truth--as nearly as the limitations of\r\nlanguage will allow.  But language is a treacherous thing, a most unsure\r\nvehicle, and it can seldom arrange descriptive words in such a way that\r\nthey will not inflate the facts--by help of the reader's imagination,\r\nwhich is always ready to take a hand, and work for nothing, and do the\r\nbulk of it at that.\r\n\r\nI will begin with a few sentences from the excellent little local\r\nguide-book of Mr. Satya Chandra Mukerji.  I take them from here and there\r\nin his description:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe inlaid work of the Taj and the flowers and petals that are to\r\n     be found on all sides on the surface of the marble evince a most\r\n     delicate touch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat is true.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe inlaid work, the marble, the flowers, the buds, the leaves, the\r\n     petals, and the lotus stems are almost without a rival in the whole\r\n     of the civilized world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe work of inlaying with stones and gems is found in the highest\r\n     perfection in the Taj.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nGems, inlaid flowers, buds, and leaves to be found on all sides.  What do\r\nyou see before you?  Is the fairy structure growing?  Is it becoming a\r\njewel casket?\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole of the Taj produces a wonderful effect that is equally\r\n     sublime and beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen Sir William Wilson Hunter:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe Taj Mahal with its beautiful domes, 'a dream of marble,' rises\r\n     on the river bank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe materials are white marble and red sandstone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe complexity of its design and the delicate intricacy of the\r\n     workmanship baffle description.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSir William continues.  I will italicize some of his words:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe mausoleum stands on a raised marble platform at each of whose\r\n     corners rises a tall and slender minaret of graceful proportions and\r\n     of exquisite beauty.  Beyond the platform stretch the two wings, one\r\n     of which is itself a mosque of great architectural merit.  In the\r\n     center of the whole design the mausoleum occupies a square of 186\r\n     feet, with the angles deeply truncated so as to form an unequal\r\n     octagon.  The main feature in this central pile is the great dome,\r\n     which swells upward to nearly two-thirds of a sphere and tapers at\r\n     its extremity into a pointed spire crowned by a crescent.  Beneath\r\n     it an enclosure of marble trellis-work surrounds the tomb of the\r\n     princess and of her husband, the Emperor.  Each corner of the\r\n     mausoleum is covered by a similar though much smaller dome erected\r\n     on a pediment pierced with graceful Saracenic arches.  Light is\r\n     admitted into the interior through a double screen of pierced\r\n     marble, which tempers the glare of an Indian sky while its whiteness\r\n     prevents the mellow effect from degenerating into gloom.  The\r\n     internal decorations consist of inlaid work in precious stones, such\r\n     as agate, jasper, etc., with which every squandril or salient point\r\n     in the architecture is richly fretted.  Brown and violet marble is\r\n     also freely employed in wreaths, scrolls, and lintels to relieve the\r\n     monotony of white wall.  In regard to color and design, the interior\r\n     of the Taj may rank first in the world for purely decorative\r\n     workmanship; while the perfect symmetry of its exterior, once seen\r\n     can never be forgotten, nor the aerial grace of its domes, rising\r\n     like marble bubbles into the clear sky.  The Taj represents the most\r\n     highly elaborated stage of ornamentation reached by the\r\n     Indo-Mohammedan builders, the stage in which the architect ends and\r\n     the jeweler begins.  In its magnificent gateway the diagonal\r\n     ornamentation at the corners, which satisfied the designers of the\r\n     gateways of Itimad-ud-doulah and Sikandra mausoleums is superseded\r\n     by fine marble cables, in bold twists, strong and handsome.  The\r\n     triangular insertions of white marble and large flowers have in like\r\n     manner given place to fine inlaid work.  Firm perpendicular lines in\r\n     black marble with well proportioned panels of the same material are\r\n     effectively used in the interior of the gateway.  On its top the\r\n     Hindu brackets and monolithic architraves of Sikandra are replaced\r\n     by Moorish carped arches, usually single blocks of red sandstone, in\r\n     the Kiosks and pavilions which adorn the roof.  From the pillared\r\n     pavilions a magnificent view is obtained of the Taj gardens below,\r\n     with the noble Jumna river at their farther end, and the city and\r\n     fort of Agra in the distance.  From this beautiful and splendid\r\n     gateway one passes up a straight alley shaded by evergreen trees\r\n     cooled by a broad shallow piece of water running along the middle of\r\n     the path to the Taj itself.  The Taj is entirely of marble and gems.\r\n     The red sandstone of the other Mohammedan buildings has entirely\r\n     disappeared, or rather the red sandstone which used to form the\r\n     thickness of the walls, is in the Taj itself overlaid completely\r\n     with white marble, and the white marble is itself inlaid with\r\n     precious stones arranged in lovely patterns of flowers.  A feeling\r\n     of purity impresses itself on the eye and the mind from the absence\r\n     of the coarser material which forms so invariable a material in Agra\r\n     architecture.  The lower wall and panels are covered with tulips,\r\n     oleanders, and fullblown lilies, in flat carving on the white\r\n     marble; and although the inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very\r\n     brilliant when looked at closely, there is on the whole but little\r\n     color, and the all-prevailing sentiment is one of whiteness,\r\n     silence, and calm.  The whiteness is broken only by the fine color\r\n     of the inlaid gems, by lines in black marble, and by delicately\r\n     written inscriptions, also in black, from the Koran.  Under the dome\r\n     of the vast mausoleum a high and beautiful screen of open tracery in\r\n     white marble rises around the two tombs, or rather cenotaphs of the\r\n     emperor and his princess; and in this marvel of marble the carving\r\n     has advanced from the old geometrical patterns to a trellis-work of\r\n     flowers and foliage, handled with great freedom and spirit.  The two\r\n     cenotaphs in the center of the exquisite enclosure have no carving\r\n     except the plain Kalamdan or oblong pen-box on the tomb of Emperor\r\n     Shah Jehan.  But both cenotaphs are inlaid with flowers made of\r\n     costly gems, and with the ever graceful oleander scroll.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBayard Taylor, after describing the details of the Taj, goes on to say:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cOn both sides the palm, the banyan, and the feathery bamboo mingle\r\n     their foliage; the song of birds meets your ears, and the odor of\r\n     roses and lemon flowers sweetens the air.  Down such a vista and\r\n     over such a foreground rises the Taj.  There is no mystery, no sense\r\n     of partial failure about the Taj.  A thing of perfect beauty and of\r\n     absolute finish in every detail, it might pass for the work of genii\r\n     who knew naught of the weaknesses and ills with which mankind are\r\n     beset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll of these details are true.  But, taken together, they state a\r\nfalsehood--to you.  You cannot add them up correctly.  Those writers know\r\nthe values of their words and phrases, but to you the words and phrases\r\nconvey other and uncertain values.  To those writers their phrases have\r\nvalues which I think I am now acquainted with; and for the help of the\r\nreader I will here repeat certain of those words and phrases, and follow\r\nthem with numerals which shall represent those values--then we shall see\r\nthe difference between a writer's ciphering and a mistaken reader's--\r\n\r\nPrecious stones, such as agate, jasper, etc.--5.\r\n\r\nWith which every salient point is richly fretted--5.\r\n\r\nFirst in the world for purely decorative workmanship--9.\r\n\r\nThe Taj represents the stage where the architect ends and the jeweler\r\nbegins--5.\r\n\r\nThe Taj is entirely of marble and gems--7.\r\n\r\nInlaid with precious stones in lovely patterns of flowers--5.\r\n\r\nThe inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very brilliant\r\n(followed by a most important modification which the reader is sure to\r\nread too carelessly)--2.\r\n\r\nThe vast mausoleum--5.\r\n\r\nThis marvel of marble--5.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite enclosure--5.\r\n\r\nInlaid with flowers made of costly gems--5.\r\n\r\nA thing of perfect beauty and absolute finish--5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose details are correct; the figures which I have placed after them\r\nrepresent quite fairly their individual, values.  Then why, as a whole,\r\ndo they convey a false impression to the reader?  It is because the\r\nreader--beguiled by his heated imagination--masses them in the wrong\r\nway.  The writer would mass the first three figures in the following way,\r\nand they would speak the truth.\r\n5\r\n5\r\n9\r\nTotal--19\r\n\r\nBut the reader masses them thus--and then they tell a lie--559.\r\n\r\nThe writer would add all of his twelve numerals together, and then the\r\nsum would express the whole truth about the Taj, and the truth only--63.\r\n\r\nBut the reader--always helped by his imagination--would put the figures\r\nin a row one after the other, and get this sum, which would tell him a\r\nnoble big lie:\r\n\r\n559575255555.\r\n\r\nYou must put in the commas yourself; I have to go on with my work.\r\n\r\nThe reader will always be sure to put the figures together in that wrong\r\nway, and then as surely before him will stand, sparkling in the sun, a\r\ngem-crusted Taj tall as the Matterhorn.\r\n\r\nI had to visit Niagara fifteen times before I succeeded in getting my\r\nimaginary Falls gauged to the actuality and could begin to sanely and\r\nwholesomely wonder at them for what they were, not what I had expected\r\nthem to be.  When I first approached them it was with my face lifted\r\ntoward the sky, for I thought I was going to see an Atlantic ocean\r\npouring down thence over cloud-vexed Himalayan heights, a sea-green wall\r\nof water sixty miles front and six miles high, and so, when the toy\r\nreality came suddenly into view--that beruffled little wet apron hanging\r\nout to dry--the shock was too much for me, and I fell with a dull thud.\r\n\r\nYet slowly, surely, steadily, in the course of my fifteen visits, the\r\nproportions adjusted themselves to the facts, and I came at last to\r\nrealize that a waterfall a hundred and sixty-five feet high and a quarter\r\nof a mile wide was an impressive thing.  It was not a dipperful to my\r\nvanished great vision, but it would answer.\r\n\r\nI know that I ought to do with the Taj as I was obliged to do with\r\nNiagara--see it fifteen times, and let my mind gradually get rid of the\r\nTaj built in it by its describers, by help of my imagination, and\r\nsubstitute for it the Taj of fact.  It would be noble and fine, then, and\r\na marvel; not the marvel which it replaced, but still a marvel, and fine\r\nenough.  I am a careless reader, I suppose--an impressionist reader; an\r\nimpressionist reader of what is not an impressionist picture; a reader\r\nwho overlooks the informing details or masses their sum improperly, and\r\ngets only a large splashy, general effect--an effect which is not\r\ncorrect, and which is not warranted by the particulars placed before me--\r\nparticulars which I did not examine, and whose meanings I did not\r\ncautiously and carefully estimate.  It is an effect which is some\r\nthirty-five or forty times finer than the reality, and is therefore a\r\ngreat deal better and more valuable than the reality; and so, I ought\r\nnever to hunt up the reality, but stay miles away from it, and thus\r\npreserve undamaged my own private mighty Niagara tumbling out of the\r\nvault of heaven, and my own ineffable Taj, built of tinted mists upon\r\njeweled arches of rainbows supported by colonnades of moonlight.  It is a\r\nmistake for a person with an unregulated imagination to go and look at an\r\nillustrious world's wonder.\r\n\r\nI suppose that many, many years ago I gathered the idea that the Taj's\r\nplace in the achievements of man was exactly the place of the ice-storm\r\nin the achievements of Nature; that the Taj represented man's supremest\r\npossibility in the creation of grace and beauty and exquisiteness and\r\nsplendor, just as the ice-storm represents Nature's supremest possibility\r\nin the combination of those same qualities.  I do not know how long ago\r\nthat idea was bred in me, but I know that I cannot remember back to a\r\ntime when the thought of either of these symbols of gracious and\r\nunapproachable perfection did not at once suggest the other.  If I\r\nthought of the ice-storm, the Taj rose before me divinely beautiful; if I\r\nthought of the Taj, with its encrustings and inlayings of jewels, the\r\nvision of the ice-storm rose.  And so, to me, all these years, the Taj\r\nhas had no rival among the temples and palaces of men, none that even\r\nremotely approached it--it was man's architectural ice-storm.\r\n\r\nHere in London the other night I was talking with some Scotch and English\r\nfriends, and I mentioned the ice-storm, using it as a figure--a figure\r\nwhich failed, for none of them had heard of the ice-storm.  One\r\ngentleman, who was very familiar with American literature, said he had\r\nnever seen it mentioned in any book.  That is strange.  And I, myself,\r\nwas not able to say that I had seen it mentioned in a book; and yet the\r\nautumn foliage, with all other American scenery, has received full and\r\ncompetent attention.\r\n\r\nThe oversight is strange, for in America the ice-storm is an event.  And\r\nit is not an event which one is careless about.  When it comes, the news\r\nflies from room to room in the house, there are bangings on the doors,\r\nand shoutings, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ice-storm! the ice-storm!\xe2\x80\x9d and even the laziest\r\nsleepers throw off the covers and join the rush for the windows.  The\r\nice-storm occurs in midwinter, and usually its enchantments are wrought\r\nin the silence and the darkness of the night.  A fine drizzling rain\r\nfalls hour after hour upon the naked twigs and branches of the trees, and\r\nas it falls it freezes.  In time the trunk and every branch and twig are\r\nincased in hard pure ice; so that the tree looks like a skeleton tree\r\nmade all of glass--glass that is crystal-clear.  All along the underside\r\nof every branch and twig is a comb of little icicles--the frozen drip.\r\nSometimes these pendants do not quite amount to icicles, but are round\r\nbeads--frozen tears.\r\n\r\nThe weather clears, toward dawn, and leaves a brisk pure atmosphere and a\r\nsky without a shred of cloud in it--and everything is still, there is not\r\na breath of wind.  The dawn breaks and spreads, the news of the storm\r\ngoes about the house, and the little and the big, in wraps and blankets,\r\nflock to the window and press together there, and gaze intently out upon\r\nthe great white ghost in the grounds, and nobody says a word, nobody\r\nstirs.  All are waiting; they know what is coming, and they are waiting\r\nwaiting for the miracle.  The minutes drift on and on and on, with not a\r\nsound but the ticking of the clock; at last the sun fires a sudden sheaf\r\nof rays into the ghostly tree and turns it into a white splendor of\r\nglittering diamonds.  Everybody catches his breath, and feels a swelling\r\nin his throat and a moisture in his eyes-but waits again; for he knows\r\nwhat is coming; there is more yet.  The sun climbs higher, and still\r\nhigher, flooding the tree from its loftiest spread of branches to its\r\nlowest, turning it to a glory of white fire; then in a moment, without\r\nwarning, comes the great miracle, the supreme miracle, the miracle\r\nwithout its fellow in the earth; a gust of wind sets every branch and\r\ntwig to swaying, and in an instant turns the whole white tree into a\r\nspouting and spraying explosion of flashing gems of every conceivable\r\ncolor; and there it stands and sways this way and that, flash! flash!\r\nflash! a dancing and glancing world of rubies, emeralds, diamonds,\r\nsapphires, the most radiant spectacle, the most blinding spectacle, the\r\ndivinest, the most exquisite, the most intoxicating vision of fire and\r\ncolor and intolerable and unimaginable splendor that ever any eye has\r\nrested upon in this world, or will ever rest upon outside of the gates of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nBy all my senses, all my faculties, I know that the icestorm is Nature's\r\nsupremest achievement in the domain of the superb and the beautiful; and\r\nby my reason, at least, I know that the Taj is man's ice-storm.\r\n\r\nIn the ice-storm every one of the myriad ice-beads pendant from twig and\r\nbranch is an individual gem, and changes color with every motion caused\r\nby the wind; each tree carries a million, and a forest-front exhibits the\r\nsplendors of the single tree multiplied by a thousand.\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me now that I have never seen the ice-storm put upon canvas,\r\nand have not heard that any painter has tried to do it.  I wonder why\r\nthat is.  Is it that paint cannot counterfeit the intense blaze of a\r\nsun-flooded jewel?  There should be, and must be, a reason, and a good\r\none,\r\nwhy the most enchanting sight that Nature has created has been neglected\r\nby the brush.\r\n\r\nOften, the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the strict\r\ntruth.  The describers of the Taj have used the word gem in its strictest\r\nsense--its scientific sense.  In that sense it is a mild word, and\r\npromises but little to the eye--nothing bright, nothing brilliant,\r\nnothing sparkling, nothing splendid in the way of color.  It accurately\r\ndescribes the sober and unobtrusive gem-work of the Taj; that is, to the\r\nvery highly-educated one person in a thousand; but it most falsely\r\ndescribes it to the 999.  But the 999 are the people who ought to be\r\nespecially taken care of, and to them it does not mean quiet-colored\r\ndesigns wrought in carnelians, or agates, or such things; they know the\r\nword in its wide and ordinary sense only, and so to them it means\r\ndiamonds and rubies and opals and their kindred, and the moment their\r\neyes fall upon it in print they see a vision of glorious colors clothed\r\nin fire.\r\n\r\nThese describers are writing for the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral,\xe2\x80\x9d and so, in order to make\r\nsure of being understood, they ought to use words in their ordinary\r\nsense, or else explain.  The word fountain means one thing in Syria,\r\nwhere there is but a handful of people; it means quite another thing in\r\nNorth America, where there are 75,000,000.  If I were describing some\r\nSyrian scenery, and should exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cWithin the narrow space of a quarter\r\nof a mile square I saw, in the glory of the flooding moonlight, two\r\nhundred noble fountains--imagine the spectacle!\xe2\x80\x9d the North American would\r\nhave a vision of clustering columns of water soaring aloft, bending over\r\nin graceful arches, bursting in beaded spray and raining white fire in\r\nthe moonlight-and he would be deceived.  But the Syrian would not be\r\ndeceived; he would merely see two hundred fresh-water springs--two\r\nhundred drowsing puddles, as level and unpretentious and unexcited as so\r\nmany door-mats, and even with the help of the moonlight he would not lose\r\nhis grip in the presence of the exhibition.  My word \xe2\x80\x9cfountain\xe2\x80\x9d would be\r\ncorrect; it would speak the strict truth; and it would convey the strict\r\ntruth to the handful of Syrians, and the strictest misinformation to the\r\nNorth American millions.  With their gems--and gems--and more gems--and\r\ngems again--and still other gems--the describers of the Taj are within\r\ntheir legal but not their moral rights; they are dealing in the strictest\r\nscientific truth; and in doing it they succeed to admiration in telling\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat ain't so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nSATAN (impatiently) to NEW-COMER.  The trouble with you Chicago people\r\nis, that you think you are the best people down here; whereas you are\r\nmerely the most numerous.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWe wandered contentedly around here and there in India; to Lahore, among\r\nother places, where the Lieutenant-Governor lent me an elephant.  This\r\nhospitality stands out in my experiences in a stately isolation.  It was\r\na fine elephant, affable, gentlemanly, educated, and I was not afraid of\r\nit.  I even rode it with confidence through the crowded lanes of the\r\nnative city, where it scared all the horses out of their senses, and\r\nwhere children were always just escaping its feet.  It took the middle of\r\nthe road in a fine independent way, and left it to the world to get out\r\nof the way or take the consequences.  I am used to being afraid of\r\ncollisions when I ride or drive, but when one is on top of an elephant\r\nthat feeling is absent.  I could have ridden in comfort through a\r\nregiment of runaway teams.  I could easily learn to prefer an elephant to\r\nany other vehicle, partly because of that immunity from collisions, and\r\npartly because of the fine view one has from up there, and partly because\r\nof the dignity one feels in that high place, and partly because one can\r\nlook in at the windows and see what is going on privately among the\r\nfamily.  The Lahore horses were used to elephants, but they were\r\nrapturously afraid of them just the same.  It seemed curious.  Perhaps\r\nthe better they know the elephant the more they respect him in that\r\npeculiar way.  In our own case--we are not afraid of dynamite till we get\r\nacquainted with it.\r\n\r\nWe drifted as far as Rawal Pindi, away up on the Afghan frontier--I think\r\nit was the Afghan frontier, but it may have been Hertzegovina--it was\r\naround there somewhere--and down again to Delhi, to see the ancient\r\narchitectural wonders there and in Old Delhi and not describe them, and\r\nalso to see the scene of the illustrious assault, in the Mutiny days,\r\nwhen the British carried Delhi by storm, one of the marvels of history\r\nfor impudent daring and immortal valor.\r\n\r\nWe had a refreshing rest, there in Delhi, in a great old mansion which\r\npossessed historical interest.  It was built by a rich Englishman who had\r\nbecome orientalized--so much so that he had a zenana.  But he was a\r\nbroadminded man, and remained so.  To please his harem he built a mosque;\r\nto please himself he built an English church.  That kind of a man will\r\narrive, somewhere.  In the Mutiny days the mansion was the British\r\ngeneral's headquarters.  It stands in a great garden--oriental fashion\r\n--and about it are many noble trees.  The trees harbor monkeys; and they\r\nare monkeys of a watchful and enterprising sort, and not much troubled\r\nwith fear.  They invade the house whenever they get a chance, and carry\r\noff everything they don't want.  One morning the master of the house was\r\nin his bath, and the window was open.  Near it stood a pot of yellow\r\npaint and a brush.  Some monkeys appeared in the window; to scare them\r\naway, the gentleman threw his sponge at them.  They did not scare at all;\r\nthey jumped into the room and threw yellow paint all over him from the\r\nbrush, and drove him out; then they painted the walls and the floor and\r\nthe tank and the windows and the furniture yellow, and were in the\r\ndressing-room painting that when help arrived and routed them.\r\n\r\nTwo of these creatures came into my room in the early morning, through a\r\nwindow whose shutters I had left open, and when I woke one of them was\r\nbefore the glass brushing his hair, and the other one had my note-book,\r\nand was reading a page of humorous notes and crying.  I did not mind the\r\none with the hair-brush, but the conduct of the other one hurt me; it\r\nhurts me yet.  I threw something at him, and that was wrong, for my host\r\nhad told me that the monkeys were best left alone.  They threw everything\r\nat me that they could lift, and then went into the bathroom to get some\r\nmore things, and I shut the door on them.\r\n\r\nAt Jeypore, in Rajputana, we made a considerable stay.  We were not in\r\nthe native city, but several miles from it, in the small European\r\nofficial suburb.  There were but few Europeans--only fourteen but they\r\nwere all kind and hospitable, and it amounted to being at home.  In\r\nJeypore we found again what we had found all about India--that while the\r\nIndian servant is in his way a very real treasure, he will sometimes bear\r\nwatching, and the Englishman watches him.  If he sends him on an errand,\r\nhe wants more than the man's word for it that he did the errand.  When\r\nfruit and vegetables were sent to us, a \xe2\x80\x9cchit\xe2\x80\x9d came with them--a receipt\r\nfor us to sign; otherwise the things might not arrive.  If a gentleman\r\nsent up his carriage, the chit stated \xe2\x80\x9cfrom\xe2\x80\x9d such-and-such an hour \xe2\x80\x9cto\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n such-and-such an hour--which made it unhandy for the coachman and his two\r\nor three subordinates to put us off with a part of the allotted time and\r\ndevote the rest of it to a lark of their own.\r\n\r\nWe were pleasantly situated in a small two-storied inn, in an empty large\r\ncompound which was surrounded by a mud wall as high as a man's head.  The\r\ninn was kept by nine Hindoo brothers, its owners.  They lived, with their\r\nfamilies, in a one-storied building within the compound, but off to one\r\nside, and there was always a long pile of their little comely brown\r\nchildren loosely stacked in its veranda, and a detachment of the parents\r\nwedged among them, smoking the hookah or the howdah, or whatever they\r\ncall it.  By the veranda stood a palm, and a monkey lived in it, and led\r\na lonesome life, and always looked sad and weary, and the crows bothered\r\nhim a good deal.\r\n\r\nThe inn cow poked about the compound and emphasized the secluded and\r\ncountry air of the place, and there was a dog of no particular breed, who\r\nwas always present in the compound, and always asleep, always stretched\r\nout baking in the sun and adding to the deep tranquility and\r\nreposefulness of the place, when the crows were away on business.\r\nWhite-draperied servants were coming and going all the time, but they\r\nseemed only spirits, for their feet were bare and made no sound.  Down\r\nthe lane a piece lived an elephant in the shade of a noble tree, and\r\nrocked and rocked, and reached about with his trunk, begging of his brown\r\nmistress or fumbling the children playing at his feet.  And there were\r\ncamels about, but they go on velvet feet, and were proper to the silence\r\nand serenity of the surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe Satan mentioned at the head of this chapter was not our Satan, but\r\nthe other one.  Our Satan was lost to us.  In these later days he had\r\npassed out of our life--lamented by me, and sincerely.  I was missing\r\nhim; I am missing him yet, after all these months.  He was an astonishing\r\ncreature to fly around and do things.  He didn't always do them quite\r\nright, but he did them, and did them suddenly.  There was no time wasted.\r\nYou would say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPack the trunks and bags, Satan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWair good\xe2\x80\x9d (very good).\r\n\r\nThen there would be a brief sound of thrashing and slashing and humming\r\nand buzzing, and a spectacle as of a whirlwind spinning gowns and jackets\r\nand coats and boots and things through the air, and then with bow and\r\ntouch--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwready, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful.  It made one dizzy.  He crumpled dresses a good deal,\r\nand he had no particular plan about the work--at first--except to put\r\neach article into the trunk it didn't belong in.  But he soon reformed,\r\nin this matter.  Not entirely; for, to the last, he would cram into the\r\nsatchel sacred to literature any odds and ends of rubbish that he\r\ncouldn't find a handy place for elsewhere.  When threatened with death\r\nfor this, it did not trouble him; he only looked pleasant, saluted with\r\nsoldierly grace, said \xe2\x80\x9cWair good,\xe2\x80\x9d and did it again next day.\r\n\r\nHe was always busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots polished, the\r\nclothes brushed, the wash-basin full of clean water, my dress clothes\r\nlaid out and ready for the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time; and he\r\ndressed me from head to heel in spite of my determination to do it\r\nmyself, according to my lifelong custom.\r\n\r\nHe was a born boss, and loved to command, and to jaw and dispute with\r\ninferiors and harry them and bullyrag them.  He was fine at the railway\r\nstation--yes, he was at his finest there.  He would shoulder and plunge\r\nand paw his violent way through the packed multitude of natives with\r\nnineteen coolies at his tail, each bearing a trifle of luggage--one a\r\ntrunk, another a parasol, another a shawl, another a fan, and so on; one\r\narticle to each, and the longer the procession, the better he was suited\r\n--and he was sure to make for some engaged sleeper and begin to hurl the\r\nowner's things out of it, swearing that it was ours and that there had\r\nbeen a mistake.  Arrived at our own sleeper, he would undo the\r\nbedding-bundles and make the beds and put everything to rights and\r\nshipshape in two minutes; then put his head out at a window and have a\r\nrestful good time abusing his gang of coolies and disputing their bill\r\nuntil we arrived and made him pay them and stop his noise.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of noise, he certainly was the noisest little devil in India\r\n--and that is saying much, very much, indeed.  I loved him for his noise,\r\nbut the family detested him for it.  They could not abide it; they could\r\nnot get reconciled to it.  It humiliated them.  As a rule, when we got\r\nwithin six hundred yards of one of those big railway stations, a mighty\r\nracket of screaming and shrieking and shouting and storming would break\r\nupon us, and I would be happy to myself, and the family would say, with\r\nshame:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere--that's Satan.  Why do you keep him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd, sure enough, there in the whirling midst of fifteen hundred\r\nwondering people we would find that little scrap of a creature\r\ngesticulating like a spider with the colic, his black eyes snapping, his\r\nfez-tassel dancing, his jaws pouring out floods of billingsgate upon his\r\ngang of beseeching and astonished coolies.\r\n\r\nI loved him; I couldn't help it; but the family--why, they could hardly\r\nspeak of him with patience.  To this day I regret his loss, and wish I\r\nhad him back; but they--it is different with them.  He was a native, and\r\ncame from Surat.  Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his birthplace\r\nand Manuel's, and fifteen hundred between their ways and characters and\r\ndispositions.  I only liked Manuel, but I loved Satan.  This latter's\r\nreal name was intensely Indian.  I could not quite get the hang of it,\r\nbut it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder.  It was too long\r\nfor handy use, anyway; so I reduced it.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been with us two or three weeks, he began to make mistakes\r\nwhich I had difficulty in patching up for him.  Approaching Benares one\r\nday, he got out of the train to see if he could get up a misunderstanding\r\nwith somebody, for it had been a weary, long journey and he wanted to\r\nfreshen up.  He found what he was after, but kept up his pow-wow a shade\r\ntoo long and got left.  So there we were in a strange city and no\r\nchambermaid.  It was awkward for us, and we told him he must not do so\r\nany more.  He saluted and said in his dear, pleasant way, \xe2\x80\x9cWair good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then at Lucknow he got drunk.  I said it was a fever, and got the\r\nfamily's compassion, and solicitude aroused; so they gave him a\r\nteaspoonful of liquid quinine and it set his vitals on fire.  He made\r\nseveral grimaces which gave me a better idea of the Lisbon earthquake\r\nthan any I have ever got of it from paintings and descriptions.  His\r\ndrunk was still portentously solid next morning, but I could have pulled\r\nhim through with the family if he would only have taken another spoonful\r\nof that remedy; but no, although he was stupefied, his memory still had\r\nflickerings of life; so he smiled a divinely dull smile and said,\r\nfumblingly saluting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScoose me, mem Saheb, scoose me, Missy Saheb; Satan not prefer it,\r\nplease.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen some instinct revealed to them that he was drunk.  They gave him\r\nprompt notice that next time this happened he must go.  He got out a\r\nmaudlin and most gentle \xe2\x80\x9cWair good,\xe2\x80\x9d and saluted indefinitely.\r\n\r\nOnly one short week later he fell again.  And oh, sorrow! not in a hotel\r\nthis time, but in an English gentleman's private house.  And in Agra, of\r\nall places.  So he had to go.  When I told him, he said patiently, \xe2\x80\x9cWair\r\ngood,\xe2\x80\x9d and made his parting salute, and went out from us to return no\r\nmore forever.  Dear me!  I would rather have lost a hundred angels than\r\nthat one poor lovely devil.  What style he used to put on, in a swell\r\nhotel or in a private house--snow-white muslin from his chin to his bare\r\nfeet, a crimson sash embroidered with gold thread around his waist, and\r\non his head a great sea-green turban like to the turban of the Grand\r\nTurk.\r\n\r\nHe was not a liar; but he will become one if he keeps on.  He told me\r\nonce that he used to crack cocoanuts with his teeth when he was a boy;\r\nand when I asked how he got them into his mouth, he said he was upward of\r\nsix feet high at that time, and had an unusual mouth.  And when I\r\nfollowed him up and asked him what had become of that other foot, he said\r\na house fell on him and he was never able to get his stature back again.\r\nSwervings like these from the strict line of fact often beguile a\r\ntruthful man on and on until he eventually becomes a liar.\r\n\r\nHis successor was a Mohammedan, Sahadat Mohammed Khan; very dark, very\r\ntall, very grave.  He went always in flowing masses of white, from the\r\ntop of his big turban down to his bare feet.  His voice was low.  He\r\nglided about in a noiseless way, and looked like a ghost.  He was\r\ncompetent and satisfactory.  But where he was, it seemed always Sunday.\r\nIt was not so in Satan's time.\r\n\r\nJeypore is intensely Indian, but it has two or three features which\r\nindicate the presence of European science and European interest in the\r\nweal of the common public, such as the liberal water-supply furnished by\r\ngreat works built at the State's expense; good sanitation, resulting in a\r\ndegree of healthfulness unusually high for India; a noble pleasure\r\ngarden, with privileged days for women; schools for the instruction of\r\nnative youth in advanced art, both ornamental and utilitarian; and a new\r\nand beautiful palace stocked with a museum of extraordinary interest and\r\nvalue.  Without the Maharaja's sympathy and purse these beneficences\r\ncould not have been created; but he is a man of wide views and large\r\ngenerosities, and all such matters find hospitality with him.\r\n\r\nWe drove often to the city from the hotel Kaiser-i-Hind, a journey which\r\nwas always full of interest, both night and day, for that country road\r\nwas never quiet, never empty, but was always India in motion, always a\r\nstreaming flood of brown people clothed in smouchings from the rainbow, a\r\ntossing and moiling flood, happy, noisy, a charming and satisfying\r\nconfusion of strange human and strange animal life and equally strange\r\nand outlandish vehicles.\r\n\r\nAnd the city itself is a curiosity.  Any Indian city is that, but this\r\none is not like any other that we saw.  It is shut up in a lofty turreted\r\nwall; the main body of it is divided into six parts by perfectly straight\r\nstreets that are more than a hundred feet wide; the blocks of houses\r\nexhibit a long frontage of the most taking architectural quaintnesses,\r\nthe straight lines being broken everywhere by pretty little balconies,\r\npillared and highly ornamented, and other cunning and cozy and inviting\r\nperches and projections, and many of the fronts are curiously pictured by\r\nthe brush, and the whole of them have the soft rich tint of strawberry\r\nice-cream.  One cannot look down the far stretch of the chief street and\r\npersuade himself that these are real houses, and that it is all out of\r\ndoors--the impression that it is an unreality, a picture, a scene in a\r\ntheater, is the only one that will take hold.\r\n\r\nThen there came a great day when this illusion was more pronounced than\r\never.  A rich Hindoo had been spending a fortune upon the manufacture of\r\na crowd of idols and accompanying paraphernalia whose purpose was to\r\nillustrate scenes in the life of his especial god or saint, and this fine\r\nshow was to be brought through the town in processional state at ten in\r\nthe morning.  As we passed through the great public pleasure garden on\r\nour way to the city we found it crowded with natives.  That was one\r\nsight.  Then there was another.  In the midst of the spacious lawns\r\nstands the palace which contains the museum--a beautiful construction of\r\nstone which shows arched colonnades, one above another, and receding,\r\nterrace-fashion, toward the sky.  Every one of these terraces, all the\r\nway to the top one, was packed and jammed with natives.  One must try to\r\nimagine those solid masses of splendid color, one above another, up and\r\nup, against the blue sky, and the Indian sun turning them all to beds of\r\nfire and flame.\r\n\r\nLater, when we reached the city, and glanced down the chief avenue,\r\nsmouldering in its crushed-strawberry tint, those splendid effects were\r\nrepeated; for every balcony, and every fanciful bird-cage of a snuggery\r\ncountersunk in the house-fronts, and all the long lines of roofs were\r\ncrowded with people, and each crowd was an explosion of brilliant color.\r\n\r\nThen the wide street itself, away down and down and down into the\r\ndistance, was alive with gorgeously-clothed people not still, but moving,\r\nswaying, drifting, eddying, a delirious display of all colors and all\r\nshades of color, delicate, lovely, pale, soft, strong, stunning, vivid,\r\nbrilliant, a sort of storm of sweetpea blossoms passing on the wings of a\r\nhurricane; and presently, through this storm of color, came swaying and\r\nswinging the majestic elephants, clothed in their Sunday best of\r\ngaudinesses, and the long procession of fanciful trucks freighted with\r\ntheir groups of curious and costly images, and then the long rearguard of\r\nstately camels, with their picturesque riders.\r\n\r\nFor color, and picturesqueness, and novelty, and outlandishness, and\r\nsustained interest and fascination, it was the most satisfying show I had\r\never seen, and I suppose I shall not have the privilege of looking upon\r\nits like again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nIn the first place God made idiots.  This was for practice.  Then He made\r\nSchool Boards.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nSuppose we applied no more ingenuity to the instruction of deaf and dumb\r\nand blind children than we sometimes apply in our American public schools\r\nto the instruction of children who are in possession of all their\r\nfaculties?  The result would be that the deaf and dumb and blind would\r\nacquire nothing.  They would live and die as ignorant as bricks and\r\nstones.  The methods used in the asylums are rational.  The teacher\r\nexactly measures the child's capacity, to begin with; and from thence\r\nonwards the tasks imposed are nicely gauged to the gradual development of\r\nthat capacity, the tasks keep pace with the steps of the child's\r\nprogress, they don't jump miles and leagues ahead of it by irrational\r\ncaprice and land in vacancy--according to the average public-school plan.\r\nIn the public school, apparently, they teach the child to spell cat, then\r\nask it to calculate an eclipse; when it can read words of two syllables,\r\nthey require it to explain the circulation of the blood; when it reaches\r\nthe head of the infant class they bully it with conundrums that cover the\r\ndomain of universal knowledge.  This sounds extravagant--and is; yet it\r\ngoes no great way beyond the facts.\r\n\r\nI received a curious letter one day, from the Punjab (you must pronounce\r\nit Punjawb).  The handwriting was excellent, and the wording was English\r\n--English, and yet not exactly English.  The style was easy and smooth\r\nand flowing, yet there was something subtly foreign about it--something\r\ntropically ornate and sentimental and rhetorical.  It turned out to be\r\nthe work of a Hindoo youth, the holder of a humble clerical billet in a\r\nrailway office.  He had been educated in one of the numerous colleges of\r\nIndia.  Upon inquiry I was told that the country was full of young\r\nfellows of his like.  They had been educated away up to the snow-summits\r\nof learning--and the market for all this elaborate cultivation was\r\nminutely out of proportion to the vastness of the product.  This market\r\nconsisted of some thousands of small clerical posts under the government\r\n--the supply of material for it was multitudinous.  If this youth with\r\nthe\r\nflowing style and the blossoming English was occupying a small railway\r\nclerkship, it meant that there were hundreds and hundreds as capable as\r\nhe, or he would be in a high place; and it certainly meant that there\r\nwere thousands whose education and capacity had fallen a little short,\r\nand that they would have to go without places.  Apparently, then, the\r\ncolleges of India were doing what our high schools have long been doing\r\n--richly over-supplying the market for highly-educated service; and\r\nthereby\r\ndoing a damage to the scholar, and through him to the country.\r\n\r\nAt home I once made a speech deploring the injuries inflicted by the high\r\nschool in making handicrafts distasteful to boys who would have been\r\nwilling to make a living at trades and agriculture if they had but had\r\nthe good luck to stop with the common school.  But I made no converts.\r\nNot one, in a community overrun with educated idlers who were above\r\nfollowing their fathers' mechanical trades, yet could find no market for\r\ntheir book-knowledge.  The same mail that brought me the letter from the\r\nPunjab, brought also a little book published by Messrs. Thacker, Spink &\r\nCo., of Calcutta, which interested me, for both its preface and its\r\ncontents treated of this matter of over-education.  In the preface occurs\r\nthis paragraph from the Calcutta Review.  For \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment office\xe2\x80\x9d read\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdrygoods clerkship\xe2\x80\x9d and it will fit more than one region of America:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe education that we give makes the boys a little less clownish in\r\n     their manners, and more intelligent when spoken to by strangers.  On\r\n     the other hand, it has made them less contented with their lot in\r\n     life, and less willing to work with their hands.  The form which\r\n     discontent takes in this country is not of a healthy kind; for, the\r\n     Natives of India consider that the only occupation worthy of an\r\n     educated man is that of a writership in some office, and especially\r\n     in a Government office.  The village schoolboy goes back to the plow\r\n     with the greatest reluctance; and the town schoolboy carries the\r\n     same discontent and inefficiency into his father's workshop.\r\n     Sometimes these ex-students positively refuse at first to work; and\r\n     more than once parents have openly expressed their regret that they\r\n     ever allowed their sons to be inveigled to school.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe little book which I am quoting from is called \xe2\x80\x9cIndo-Anglian\r\nLiterature,\xe2\x80\x9d and is well stocked with \xe2\x80\x9cbaboo\xe2\x80\x9d English--clerkly English,\r\nbooky English, acquired in the schools.  Some of it is very funny,\r\n--almost as funny, perhaps, as what you and I produce when we try to\r\nwrite in a language not our own; but much of it is surprisingly correct\r\nand free.  If I were going to quote good English--but I am not.  India is\r\nwell stocked with natives who speak it and write it as well as the best\r\nof us.  I merely wish to show some of the quaint imperfect attempts at\r\nthe use of our tongue.  There are many letters in the book; poverty\r\nimploring help--bread, money, kindness, office--generally an office, a\r\nclerkship, some way to get food and a rag out of the applicant's\r\nunmarketable education; and food not for himself alone, but sometimes for\r\na dozen helpless relations in addition to his own family; for those\r\npeople are astonishingly unselfish, and admirably faithful to their ties\r\nof kinship.  Among us I think there is nothing approaching it.  Strange\r\nas some of these wailing and supplicating letters are, humble and even\r\ngroveling as some of them are, and quaintly funny and confused as a\r\ngoodly number of them are, there is still a pathos about them, as a rule,\r\nthat checks the rising laugh and reproaches it.  In the following letter\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfather\xe2\x80\x9d is not to be read literally.  In Ceylon a little native\r\nbeggar-girl embarrassed me by calling me father, although I knew she was\r\nmistaken.  I was so new that I did not know that she was merely following\r\nthe custom of the dependent and the supplicant.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSIR,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI pray please to give me some action (work) for I am very poor boy\r\n     I have no one to help me even so father for it so it seemed in thy\r\n     good sight, you give the Telegraph Office, and another work what is\r\n     your wish I am very poor boy, this understand what is your wish you\r\n     my father I am your son this understand what is your wish.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cYour Sirvent, P. C. B.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThrough ages of debasing oppression suffered by these people at the hands\r\nof their native rulers, they come legitimately by the attitude and\r\nlanguage of fawning and flattery, and one must remember this in\r\nmitigation when passing judgment upon the native character.  It is common\r\nin these letters to find the petitioner furtively trying to get at the\r\nwhite man's soft religious side; even this poor boy baits his hook with a\r\nmacerated Bible-text in the hope that it may catch something if all else\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nHere is an application for the post of instructor in English to some\r\nchildren:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMy Dear Sir or Gentleman, that your Petitioner has much\r\n     qualification in the Language of English to instruct the young boys;\r\n     I was given to understand that your of suitable children has to\r\n     acquire the knowledge of English language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a sample of the flowery Eastern style, I will take a sentence or two\r\nfrom a long letter written by a young native to the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nof Bengal--an application for employment:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cHONORED AND MUCH RESPECTED SIR,\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI hope your honor will condescend to hear the tale of this poor\r\n     creature.  I shall overflow with gratitude at this mark of your\r\n     royal condescension.  The bird-like happiness has flown away from my\r\n     nest-like heart and has not hitherto returned from the period whence\r\n     the rose of my father's life suffered the autumnal breath of death,\r\n     in plain English he passed through the gates of Grave, and from that\r\n     hour the phantom of delight has never danced before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is all school-English, book-English, you see; and good enough, too,\r\nall things considered.  If the native boy had but that one study he would\r\nshine, he would dazzle, no doubt.  But that is not the case.  He is\r\nsituated as are our public-school children--loaded down with an\r\nover-freightage of other studies; and frequently they are as far beyond\r\nthe actual point of progress reached by him and suited to the stage of\r\ndevelopment attained, as could be imagined by the insanest fancy.\r\nApparently--like our public-school boy--he must work, work, work, in\r\nschool and out, and play but little.  Apparently--like our public-school\r\nboy--his \xe2\x80\x9ceducation\xe2\x80\x9d consists in learning things, not the meaning of\r\nthem; he is fed upon the husks, not the corn.  From several essays\r\nwritten by native schoolboys in answer to the question of how they spend\r\ntheir day, I select one--the one which goes most into detail:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9c66.  At the break of day I rises from my own bed and finish my\r\n     daily duty, then I employ myself till 8 o'clock, after which I\r\n     employ myself to bathe, then take for my body some sweet meat, and\r\n     just at 9 1/2 I came to school to attend my class duty, then at\r\n     2 1/2 P. M.  I return from school and engage myself to do my natural\r\n     duty, then, I engage for a quarter to take my tiffin, then I study\r\n     till 5 P. M., after which I began to play anything which comes in\r\n     my head.  After 8 1/2, half pass to eight we are began to sleep,\r\n     before sleeping I told a constable just 11 o' he came and rose us\r\n     from half pass eleven we began to read still morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt is not perfectly clear, now that I come to cipher upon it.  He gets up\r\nat about 5 in the morning, or along there somewhere, and goes to bed\r\nabout fifteen or sixteen hours afterward--that much of it seems straight;\r\nbut why he should rise again three hours later and resume his studies\r\ntill morning is puzzling.\r\n\r\nI think it is because he is studying history.  History requires a world\r\nof time and bitter hard work when your \xe2\x80\x9ceducation\xe2\x80\x9d is no further advanced\r\nthan the cat's; when you are merely stuffing yourself with a mixed-up\r\nmess of empty names and random incidents and elusive dates, which no one\r\nteaches you how to interpret, and which, uninterpreted, pay you not a\r\nfarthing's value for your waste of time.  Yes, I think he had to get up\r\nat halfpast 11 P.M.  in order to be sure to be perfect with his history\r\nlesson by noon.  With results as follows--from a Calcutta school\r\nexamination:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ.  Who was Cardinal Wolsey?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCardinal Wolsey was an Editor of a paper named North Briton.  No. 45 of\r\nhis publication he charged the King of uttering a lie from the throne.\r\nHe was arrested and cast into prison; and after releasing went to France.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c3.  As Bishop of York but died in disentry in a church on his way to be\r\nblockheaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c8.  Cardinal Wolsey was the son of Edward IV, after his father's death\r\nhe himself ascended the throne at the age of (10) ten only, but when he\r\nsurpassed or when he was fallen in his twenty years of age at that time\r\nhe wished to make a journey in his countries under him, but he was\r\nopposed by his mother to do journey, and according to his mother's\r\nexample he remained in the home, and then became King.  After many times\r\nobstacles and many confusion he become King and afterwards his brother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere is probably not a word of truth in that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQ.  What is the meaning of 'Ich Dien'?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c10.  An honor conferred on the first or eldest sons of English\r\nSovereigns.  It is nothing more than some feathers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c11.  Ich Dien was the word which was written on the feathers of the\r\nblind King who came to fight, being interlaced with the bridles of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c13.  Ich Dien is a title given to Henry VII by the Pope of Rome, when he\r\nforwarded the Reformation of Cardinal Wolsy to Rome, and for this reason\r\nhe was called Commander of the faith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA dozen or so of this kind of insane answers are quoted in the book from\r\nthat examination.  Each answer is sweeping proof, all by itself, that the\r\nperson uttering it was pushed ahead of where he belonged when he was put\r\ninto history; proof that he had been put to the task of acquiring history\r\nbefore he had had a single lesson in the art of acquiring it, which is\r\nthe equivalent of dumping a pupil into geometry before he has learned the\r\nprogressive steps which lead up to it and make its acquirement possible.\r\nThose Calcutta novices had no business with history.  There was no excuse\r\nfor examining them in it, no excuse for exposing them and their teachers.\r\nThey were totally empty; there was nothing to \xe2\x80\x9cexamine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHelen Keller has been dumb, stone deaf, and stone blind, ever since she\r\nwas a little baby a year-and-a-half old; and now at sixteen years of age\r\nthis miraculous creature, this wonder of all the ages, passes the Harvard\r\nUniversity examination in Latin, German, French history, belles lettres,\r\nand such things, and does it brilliantly, too, not in a commonplace\r\nfashion.  She doesn't know merely things, she is splendidly familiar with\r\nthe meanings of them.  When she writes an essay on a Shakespearean\r\ncharacter, her English is fine and strong, her grasp of the subject is\r\nthe grasp of one who knows, and her page is electric with light.  Has\r\nMiss Sullivan taught her by the methods of India and the American public\r\nschool?  No, oh, no; for then she would be deafer and dumber and blinder\r\nthan she was before.  It is a pity that we can't educate all the children\r\nin the asylums.\r\n\r\nTo continue the Calcutta exposure:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of a Sheriff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c25.  Sheriff is a post opened in the time of John.  The duty of Sheriff\r\nhere in Calcutta, to look out and catch those carriages which is rashly\r\ndriven out by the coachman; but it is a high post in England.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c26.  Sheriff was the English bill of common prayer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c27.  The man with whom the accusative persons are placed is called\r\nSheriff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c28.  Sheriff--Latin term for 'shrub,' we called broom, worn by the first\r\nearl of Enjue, as an emblem of humility when they went to the pilgrimage,\r\nand from this their hairs took their crest and surname.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c29.  Sheriff is a kind of titlous sect of people, as Barons, Nobles,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c30.  Sheriff; a tittle given on those persons who were respective and\r\npious in England.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe students were examined in the following bulky matters: Geometry, the\r\nSolar Spectrum, the Habeas Corpus Act, the British Parliament, and in\r\nMetaphysics they were asked to trace the progress of skepticism from\r\nDescartes to Hume.  It is within bounds to say that some of the results\r\nwere astonishing.  Without doubt, there were students present who\r\njustified their teacher's wisdom in introducing them to these studies;\r\nbut the fact is also evident that others had been pushed into these\r\nstudies to waste their time over them when they could have been\r\nprofitably employed in hunting smaller game.  Under the head of Geometry,\r\none of the answers is this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c49.  The whole BD = the whole CA, and so-so-so-so-so-so-so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo me this is cloudy, but I was never well up in geometry.  That was the\r\nonly effort made among the five students who appeared for examination in\r\ngeometry; the other four wailed and surrendered without a fight.  They\r\nare piteous wails, too, wails of despair; and one of them is an eloquent\r\nreproach; it comes from a poor fellow who has been laden beyond his\r\nstrength by a stupid teacher, and is eloquent in spite of the poverty of\r\nits English.  The poor chap finds himself required to explain riddles\r\nwhich even Sir Isaac Newton was not able to understand:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c50.  Oh my dear father examiner you my father and you kindly give a\r\nnumber of pass you my great father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c51.  I am a poor boy and have no means to support my mother and two\r\nbrothers who are suffering much for want of food.  I get four rupees\r\nmonthly from charity fund of this place, from which I send two rupees for\r\ntheir support, and keep two for my own support.  Father, if I relate the\r\nunlucky circumstance under which we are placed, then, I think, you will\r\nnot be able to suppress the tender tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c52.  Sir which Sir Isaac Newton and other experienced mathematicians\r\ncannot understand I being third of Entrance Class can understand these\r\nwhich is too impossible to imagine.  And my examiner also has put very\r\ntiresome and very heavy propositions to prove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe must remember that these pupils had to do their thinking in one\r\nlanguage, and express themselves in another and alien one.  It was a\r\nheavy handicap.  I have by me \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish as She is Taught\xe2\x80\x9d--a collection of\r\nAmerican examinations made in the public schools of Brooklyn by one of\r\nthe teachers, Miss Caroline B. Le Row.  An extract or two from its pages\r\nwill show that when the American pupil is using but one language, and\r\nthat one his own, his performance is no whit better than his Indian\r\nbrother's:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cON HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristopher Columbus was called the father of his Country.  Queen\r\nIsabella of Spain sold her watch and chain and other millinery so that\r\nColumbus could discover America.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indian wars were very desecrating to the country.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Indians pursued their warfare by hiding in the bushes and then\r\nscalping them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain John Smith has been styled the father of his country.  His life\r\nwas saved by his daughter Pochahantas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Puritans found an insane asylum in the wilds of America.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Stamp Act was to make everybody stamp all materials so they should\r\nbe null and void.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashington died in Spain almost broken-hearted.  His remains were taken\r\nto the cathedral in Havana.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGorilla warfare was where men rode on gorillas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Brooklyn, as in India, they examine a pupil, and when they find out he\r\ndoesn't know anything, they put him into literature, or geometry, or\r\nastronomy, or government, or something like that, so that he can properly\r\ndisplay the assification of the whole system--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cON LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c'Bracebridge Hall' was written by Henry Irving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEdgar A. Poe was a very curdling writer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeowulf wrote the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBen Johnson survived Shakespeare in some respects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the 'Canterbury Tale' it gives account of King Alfred on his way to\r\nthe shrine of Thomas Bucket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChaucer was the father of English pottery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChaucer was succeeded by H. Wads. Longfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will finish with a couple of samples of \xe2\x80\x9cliterature,\xe2\x80\x9d one from\r\nAmerica, the other from India.  The first is a Brooklyn public-school\r\nboy's attempt to turn a few verses of the \xe2\x80\x9cLady of the Lake\xe2\x80\x9d into prose.\r\nYou will have to concede that he did it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man who rode on the horse performed the whip and an instrument made\r\nof steel alone with strong ardor not diminishing, for, being tired from\r\nthe time passed with hard labor overworked with anger and ignorant with\r\nweariness, while every breath for labor he drew with cries full of\r\nsorrow, the young deer made imperfect who worked hard filtered in sight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph is from a little book which is famous in India\r\n--the biography of a distinguished Hindoo judge, Onoocool Chunder\r\nMookerjee; it was written by his nephew, and is unintentionally funny-in\r\nfact, exceedingly so.  I offer here the closing scene.  If you would like\r\nto sample the rest of the book, it can be had by applying to the\r\npublishers, Messrs.  Thacker, Spink & Co., Calcutta\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cAnd having said these words he hermetically sealed his lips not to\r\n     open them again.  All the well-known doctors of Calcutta that could\r\n     be procured for a man of his position and wealth were brought,\r\n     --Doctors Payne, Fayrer, and Nilmadhub Mookerjee and others; they\r\ndid\r\n     what they could do, with their puissance and knack of medical\r\n     knowledge, but it proved after all as if to milk the ram!  His wife\r\n     and children had not the mournful consolation to hear his last\r\n     words; he remained sotto voce for a few hours, and then was taken\r\n     from us at 6.12 P.m.  according to the caprice of God which passeth\r\n     understanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nThere are no people who are quite so vulgar as the over-refined ones.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from Calcutta toward the end of March; stopped a day at Madras;\r\ntwo or three days in Ceylon; then sailed westward on a long flight for\r\nMauritius.  From my diary:\r\n\r\nApril 7.  We are far abroad upon the smooth waters of the Indian Ocean,\r\nnow; it is shady and pleasant and peaceful under the vast spread of the\r\nawnings, and life is perfect again--ideal.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a river and the sea is, that the river looks\r\nfluid, the sea solid--usually looks as if you could step out and walk on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe captain has this peculiarity--he cannot tell the truth in a plausible\r\nway.  In this he is the very opposite of the austere Scot who sits midway\r\nof the table; he cannot tell a lie in an unplausible way.  When the\r\ncaptain finishes a statement the passengers glance at each other\r\nprivately, as who should say, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe that?\xe2\x80\x9d  When the Scot\r\nfinishes one, the look says, \xe2\x80\x9cHow strange and interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d  The whole\r\nsecret is in the manner and method of the two men.  The captain is a\r\nlittle shy and diffident, and he states the simplest fact as if he were a\r\nlittle afraid of it, while the Scot delivers himself of the most\r\nabandoned lie with such an air of stern veracity that one is forced to\r\nbelieve it although one knows it isn't so.  For instance, the Scot told\r\nabout a pet flying-fish he once owned, that lived in a little fountain in\r\nhis conservatory, and supported itself by catching birds and frogs and\r\nrats in the neighboring fields.  It was plain that no one at the table\r\ndoubted this statement.\r\n\r\nBy and by, in the course of some talk about custom-house annoyances, the\r\ncaptain brought out the following simple everyday incident, but through\r\nhis infirmity of style managed to tell it in such a way that it got no\r\ncredence.  He said:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI went ashore at Naples one voyage when I was in that trade, and\r\n     stood around helping my passengers, for I could speak a little\r\n     Italian.  Two or three times, at intervals, the officer asked me if\r\n     I had anything dutiable about me, and seemed more and more put out\r\n     and disappointed every time I told him no.  Finally a passenger whom\r\n     I had helped through asked me to come out and take something.  I\r\n     thanked him, but excused myself, saying I had taken a whisky just\r\n     before I came ashore.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a fatal admission.  The officer at once made me pay sixpence\r\n     import-duty on the whisky-just from ship to shore, you see; and he\r\n     fined me L5 for not declaring the goods, another L5 for falsely\r\n     denying that I had anything dutiable about me, also L5 for\r\n     concealing the goods, and L50 for smuggling, which is the maximum\r\n     penalty for unlawfully bringing in goods under the value of\r\n     sevenpence ha'penny.  Altogether, sixty-five pounds sixpence for a\r\n     little thing like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Scot is always believed, yet he never tells anything but lies;\r\nwhereas the captain is never believed, although he never tells a lie, so\r\nfar as I can judge.  If he should say his uncle was a male person, he\r\nwould probably say it in such a way that nobody would believe it; at the\r\nsame time the Scot could claim that he had a female uncle and not stir a\r\ndoubt in anybody's mind.  My own luck has been curious all my literary\r\nlife; I never could tell a lie that anybody would doubt, nor a truth that\r\nanybody would believe.\r\n\r\nLots of pets on board--birds and things.  In these far countries the\r\nwhite people do seem to run remarkably to pets.  Our host in Cawnpore had\r\na fine collection of birds--the finest we saw in a private house in\r\nIndia.  And in Colombo, Dr. Murray's great compound and commodious\r\nbungalow were well populated with domesticated company from the woods:\r\nfrisky little squirrels; a Ceylon mina walking sociably about the house;\r\na small green parrot that whistled a single urgent note of call without\r\nmotion of its beak; also chuckled; a monkey in a cage on the back\r\nveranda, and some more out in the trees; also a number of beautiful\r\nmacaws in the trees; and various and sundry birds and animals of breeds\r\nnot known to me.  But no cat.  Yet a cat would have liked that place.\r\n\r\nApril 9.  Tea-planting is the great business in Ceylon, now.  A passenger\r\nsays it often pays 40 per cent. on the investment.  Says there is a boom.\r\n\r\nApril 10.  The sea is a Mediterranean blue; and I believe that that is\r\nabout the divinest color known to nature.\r\n\r\nIt is strange and fine--Nature's lavish generosities to her creatures.\r\nAt least to all of them except man.  For those that fly she has provided\r\na home that is nobly spacious--a home which is forty miles deep and\r\nenvelops the whole globe, and has not an obstruction in it.  For those\r\nthat swim she has provided a more than imperial domain--a domain which is\r\nmiles deep and covers four-fifths of the globe.  But as for man, she has\r\ncut him off with the mere odds and ends of the creation.  She has given\r\nhim the thin skin, the meagre skin which is stretched over the remaining\r\none-fifth--the naked bones stick up through it in most places.  On the\r\none-half of this domain he can raise snow, ice, sand, rocks, and nothing\r\nelse.  So the valuable part of his inheritance really consists of but a\r\nsingle fifth of the family estate; and out of it he has to grub hard to\r\nget enough to keep him alive and provide kings and soldiers and powder to\r\nextend the blessings of civilization with.  Yet man, in his simplicity\r\nand complacency and inability to cipher, thinks Nature regards him as the\r\nimportant member of the family--in fact, her favorite.  Surely, it must\r\noccur to even his dull head, sometimes, that she has a curious way of\r\nshowing it.\r\n\r\nAfternoon.  The captain has been telling how, in one of his Arctic\r\nvoyages, it was so cold that the mate's shadow froze fast to the deck and\r\nhad to be ripped loose by main strength.  And even then he got only about\r\ntwo-thirds of it back.  Nobody said anything, and the captain went away.\r\nI think he is becoming disheartened .  .  .  .  Also, to be fair, there\r\nis another word of praise due to this ship's library: it contains no copy\r\nof the Vicar of Wakefield, that strange menagerie of complacent\r\nhypocrites and idiots, of theatrical cheap-john heroes and heroines, who\r\nare always showing off, of bad people who are not interesting, and good\r\npeople who are fatiguing.  A singular book.  Not a sincere line in it,\r\nand not a character that invites respect; a book which is one long\r\nwaste-pipe discharge of goody-goody puerilities and dreary moralities; a\r\nbook which is full of pathos which revolts, and humor which grieves the\r\nheart. There are few things in literature that are more piteous, more\r\npathetic, than the celebrated \xe2\x80\x9chumorous\xe2\x80\x9d incident of Moses and the\r\nspectacles. Jane Austen's books, too, are absent from this library.  Just\r\nthat one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library\r\nthat hadn't a book in it.\r\n\r\nCustoms in tropic seas.  At 5 in the morning they pipe to wash down the\r\ndecks, and at once the ladies who are sleeping there turn out and they\r\nand their beds go below.  Then one after another the men come up from the\r\nbath in their pyjamas, and walk the decks an hour or two with bare legs\r\nand bare feet.  Coffee and fruit served.  The ship cat and her kitten now\r\nappear and get about their toilets; next the barber comes and flays us on\r\nthe breezy deck.  Breakfast at 9.30, and the day begins.  I do not know\r\nhow a day could be more reposeful: no motion; a level blue sea; nothing\r\nin sight from horizon to horizon; the speed of the ship furnishes a\r\ncooling breeze; there is no mail to read and answer; no newspapers to\r\nexcite you; no telegrams to fret you or fright you--the world is far, far\r\naway; it has ceased to exist for you--seemed a fading dream, along in the\r\nfirst days; has dissolved to an unreality now; it is gone from your mind\r\nwith all its businesses and ambitions, its prosperities and disasters,\r\nits exultations and despairs, its joys and griefs and cares and worries.\r\nThey are no concern of yours any more; they have gone out of your life;\r\nthey are a storm which has passed and left a deep calm behind.  The\r\npeople group themselves about the decks in their snowy white linen, and\r\nread, smoke, sew, play cards, talk, nap, and so on.  In other ships the\r\npassengers are always ciphering about when they are going to arrive; out\r\nin these seas it is rare, very rare, to hear that subject broached.  In\r\nother ships there is always an eager rush to the bulletin board at noon\r\nto find out what the \xe2\x80\x9crun\xe2\x80\x9d has been; in these seas the bulletin seems to\r\nattract no interest; I have seen no one visit it; in thirteen days I have\r\nvisited it only once.  Then I happened to notice the figures of the day's\r\nrun.  On that day there happened to be talk, at dinner, about the speed\r\nof modern ships.  I was the only passenger present who knew this ship's\r\ngait.  Necessarily, the Atlantic custom of betting on the ship's run is\r\nnot a custom here--nobody ever mentions it.\r\n\r\nI myself am wholly indifferent as to when we are going to \xe2\x80\x9cget in\xe2\x80\x9d; if\r\nany one else feels interested in the matter he has not indicated it in my\r\nhearing.  If I had my way we should never get in at all.  This sort of\r\nsea life is charged with an indestructible charm.  There is no weariness,\r\nno fatigue, no worry, no responsibility, no work, no depression of\r\nspirits.  There is nothing like this serenity, this comfort, this peace,\r\nthis deep contentment, to be found anywhere on land.  If I had my way I\r\nwould sail on for ever and never go to live on the solid ground again.\r\n\r\nOne of Kipling's ballads has delivered the aspect and sentiment of this\r\nbewitching sea correctly:\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cThe Injian Ocean sets an' smiles\r\n               So sof', so bright, so bloomin' blue;\r\n               There aren't a wave for miles an' miles\r\n               Excep' the jiggle from the screw.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApril 14.  It turns out that the astronomical apprentice worked off a\r\nsection of the Milky Way on me for the Magellan Clouds.  A man of more\r\nexperience in the business showed one of them to me last night.  It was\r\nsmall and faint and delicate, and looked like the ghost of a bunch of\r\nwhite smoke left floating in the sky by an exploded bombshell.\r\n\r\nWednesday, April 15.  Mauritius.  Arrived and anchored off Port Louis\r\n2 A. M.  Rugged clusters of crags and peaks, green to their summits; from\r\ntheir bases to the sea a green plain with just tilt enough to it to make\r\nthe water drain off.  I believe it is in 56 degrees E. and 22 degrees S.\r\n--a hot tropical country.  The green plain has an inviting look; has\r\nscattering dwellings nestling among the greenery.  Scene of the\r\nsentimental adventure of Paul and Virginia.\r\n\r\nIsland under French control--which means a community which depends upon\r\nquarantines, not sanitation, for its health.\r\n\r\nThursday, April 16.  Went ashore in the forenoon at Port Louis, a little\r\ntown, but with the largest variety of nationalities and complexions we\r\nhave encountered yet.  French, English, Chinese, Arabs, Africans with\r\nwool, blacks with straight hair, East Indians, half-whites, quadroons\r\n--and great varieties in costumes and colors.\r\n\r\nTook the train for Curepipe at 1.30--two hours' run, gradually uphill.\r\nWhat a contrast, this frantic luxuriance of vegetation, with the arid\r\nplains of India; these architecturally picturesque crags and knobs and\r\nminiature mountains, with the monotony of the Indian dead-levels.\r\n\r\nA native pointed out a handsome swarthy man of grave and dignified\r\nbearing, and said in an awed tone, \xe2\x80\x9cThat is so-and-so; has held office of\r\none sort or another under this government for 37 years--he is known all\r\nover this whole island and in the other countries of the world perhaps\r\n--who knows?  One thing is certain; you can speak his name anywhere in\r\nthis\r\nwhole island, and you will find not one grown person that has not heard\r\nit.  It is a wonderful thing to be so celebrated; yet look at him; it\r\nmakes no change in him; he does not even seem to know it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCurepipe (means Pincushion or Pegtown, probably).  Sixteen miles (two\r\nhours) by rail from Port Louis.  At each end of every roof and on the\r\napex of every dormer window a wooden peg two feet high stands up; in some\r\ncases its top is blunt, in others the peg is sharp and looks like a\r\ntoothpick.  The passion for this humble ornament is universal.\r\n\r\nApparently, there has been only one prominent event in the history of\r\nMauritius, and that one didn't happen.  I refer to the romantic sojourn\r\nof Paul and Virginia here.  It was that story that made Mauritius known\r\nto the world, made the name familiar to everybody, the geographical\r\nposition of it to nobody.\r\n\r\nA clergyman was asked to guess what was in a box on a table.  It was a\r\nvellum fan painted with the shipwreck, and was \xe2\x80\x9cone of Virginia's wedding\r\ngifts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nApril 18.  This is the only country in the world where the stranger is\r\nnot asked \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you like this place?\xe2\x80\x9d  This is indeed a large\r\ndistinction.  Here the citizen does the talking about the country\r\nhimself; the stranger is not asked to help.  You get all sorts of\r\ninformation.  From one citizen you gather the idea that Mauritius was\r\nmade first, and then heaven; and that heaven was copied after Mauritius.\r\nAnother one tells you that this is an exaggeration; that the two chief\r\nvillages, Port Louis and Curepipe, fall short of heavenly perfection;\r\nthat nobody lives in Port Louis except upon compulsion, and that Curepipe\r\nis the wettest and rainiest place in the world.  An English citizen said:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIn the early part of this century Mauritius was used by the French\r\n     as a basis from which to operate against England's Indian\r\n     merchantmen; so England captured the island and also the neighbor,\r\n     Bourbon, to stop that annoyance.  England gave Bourbon back; the\r\n     government in London did not want any more possessions in the West\r\n     Indies.  If the government had had a better quality of geography in\r\n     stock it would not have wasted Bourbon in that foolish way.  A big\r\n     war will temporarily shut up the Suez Canal some day and the English\r\n     ships will have to go to India around the Cape of Good Hope again;\r\n     then England will have to have Bourbon and will take it.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cMauritius was a crown colony until 20 years ago, with a governor\r\n     appointed by the Crown and assisted by a Council appointed by\r\n     himself; but Pope Hennessey came out as Governor then, and he worked\r\n     hard to get a part of the council made elective, and succeeded.  So\r\n     now the whole council is French, and in all ordinary matters of\r\n     legislation they vote together and in the French interest, not the\r\n     English. The English population is very slender; it has not votes\r\n     enough to elect a legislator.  Half a dozen rich French families\r\n     elect the legislature.  Pope Hennessey was an Irishman, a Catholic,\r\n     a Home Ruler, M.P., a hater of England and the English, a very\r\n     troublesome person and a serious incumbrance at Westminster; so it\r\n     was decided to send him out to govern unhealthy countries, in hope\r\n     that something would happen to him.  But nothing did.  The first\r\n     experiment was not merely a failure, it was more than a failure.  He\r\n     proved to be more of a disease himself than any he was sent to\r\n     encounter.  The next experiment was here.  The dark scheme failed\r\n     again.  It was an off-season and there was nothing but measles here\r\n     at the time.  Pope Hennessey's health was not affected.  He worked\r\n     with the French and for the French and against the English, and he\r\n     made the English very tired and the French very happy, and lived to\r\n     have the joy of seeing the flag he served publicly hissed.  His\r\n     memory is held in worshipful reverence and affection by the French.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a land of extraordinary quarantines.  They quarantine a ship\r\n     for anything or for nothing; quarantine her for 20 and even 30 days.\r\n     They once quarantined a ship because her captain had had the\r\n     smallpox when he was a boy.  That and because he was English.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe population is very small; small to insignificance.  The\r\n     majority is East Indian; then mongrels; then negroes (descendants of\r\n     the slaves of the French times); then French; then English.  There\r\n     was an American, but he is dead or mislaid.  The mongrels are the\r\n     result of all kinds of mixtures; black and white, mulatto and white,\r\n     quadroon and white, octoroon and white.  And so there is every shade\r\n     of complexion; ebony, old mahogany, horsechestnut, sorrel,\r\n     molasses-candy, clouded amber, clear amber, old-ivory white,\r\n     new-ivory white, fish-belly white--this latter the leprous\r\ncomplexion\r\n     frequent with the Anglo-Saxon long resident in tropical climates.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn't expect a person to be proud of being a Mauritian, now\r\n     would you?  But it is so.  The most of them have never been out of\r\n     the island, and haven't read much or studied much, and they think\r\n     the world consists of three principal countries--Judaea, France, and\r\n     Mauritius; so they are very proud of belonging to one of the three\r\n     grand divisions of the globe.  They think that Russia and Germany\r\n     are in England, and that England does not amount to much.  They have\r\n     heard vaguely about the United States and the equator, but they\r\n     think both of them are monarchies.  They think Mount Peter Botte is\r\n     the highest mountain in the world, and if you show one of them a\r\n     picture of Milan Cathedral he will swell up with satisfaction and\r\n     say that the idea of that jungle of spires was stolen from the\r\n     forest of peg-tops and toothpicks that makes the roofs of Curepipe\r\n     look so fine and prickly.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThere is not much trade in books.  The newspapers educate and\r\n     entertain the people.  Mainly the latter.  They have two pages of\r\n     large-print reading-matter-one of them English, the other French.\r\n     The English page is a translation of the French one.  The typography\r\n     is super-extra primitive--in this quality it has not its equal\r\n     anywhere.  There is no proof-reader now; he is dead.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cWhere do they get matter to fill up a page in this little island\r\n     lost in the wastes of the Indian Ocean?  Oh, Madagascar.  They\r\n     discuss Madagascar and France.  That is the bulk.  Then they chock\r\n     up the rest with advice to the Government.  Also, slurs upon the\r\n     English administration.  The papers are all owned and edited by\r\n     creoles--French.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe language of the country is French.  Everybody speaks it--has\r\n     to.  You have to know French particularly mongrel French, the patois\r\n     spoken by Tom, Dick, and Harry of the multiform complexions--or you\r\n     can't get along.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was a flourishing country in former days, for it made then and\r\nstill makes the best sugar in the world; but first the Suez Canal severed\r\nit from the world and left it out in the cold and next the beetroot sugar\r\nhelped by bounties, captured the European markets.  Sugar is the life of\r\nMauritius, and it is losing its grip. Its downward course was checked by\r\nthe depreciation of the rupee--for the planter pays wages in rupees but\r\nsells his crop for gold--and the insurrection in Cuba and paralyzation of\r\nthe sugar industry there have given our prices here a life-saving lift;\r\nbut the outlook has nothing permanently favorable about it.  It takes a\r\nyear to mature the canes--on the high ground three and six months longer\r\n--and there is always a chance that the annual cyclone will rip the\r\nprofit out of the crop.  In recent times a cyclone took the whole crop,\r\nas you may say; and the island never saw a finer one.  Some of the\r\nnoblest sugar estates in the island are in deep difficulties.  A dozen of\r\nthem are investments of English capital; and the companies that own them\r\nare at work now, trying to settle up and get out with a saving of half\r\nthe money they put in.  You know, in these days, when a country begins to\r\nintroduce the tea culture, it means that its own specialty has gone back\r\non it.  Look at Bengal; look at Ceylon.  Well, they've begun to introduce\r\nthe tea culture, here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMany copies of Paul and Virginia are sold every year in Mauritius.  No\r\nother book is so popular here except the Bible.  By many it is supposed\r\nto be a part of the Bible.  All the missionaries work up their French on\r\nit when they come here to pervert the Catholic mongrel.  It is the\r\ngreatest story that was ever written about Mauritius, and the only one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nThe principal difference between a cat and a lie is that the cat has only\r\nnine lives.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nApril 20.--The cyclone of 1892 killed and crippled hundreds of people;\r\nit was accompanied by a deluge of rain, which drowned Port Louis and\r\nproduced a water famine.  Quite true; for it burst the reservoir and the\r\nwater-pipes; and for a time after the flood had disappeared there was\r\nmuch distress from want of water.\r\n\r\nThis is the only place in the world where no breed of matches can stand\r\nthe damp.  Only one match in 16 will light.\r\n\r\nThe roads are hard and smooth; some of the compounds are spacious, some\r\nof the bungalows commodious, and the roadways are walled by tall bamboo\r\nhedges, trim and green and beautiful; and there are azalea hedges, too,\r\nboth the white and the red; I never saw that before.\r\n\r\nAs to healthiness: I translate from to-day's (April 20) Merchants' and\r\nPlanters' Gazette, from the article of a regular contributor, \xe2\x80\x9cCarminge,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n concerning the death of the nephew of a prominent citizen:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cSad and lugubrious existence, this which we lead in Mauritius; I\r\n     believe there is no other country in the world where one dies more\r\n     easily than among us.  The least indisposition becomes a mortal\r\n     malady; a simple headache develops into meningitis; a cold into\r\n     pneumonia, and presently, when we are least expecting it, death is a\r\n     guest in our home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis daily paper has a meteorological report which tells you what the\r\nweather was day before yesterday.\r\n\r\nOne is never pestered by a beggar or a peddler in this town, so far as I\r\ncan see.  This is pleasantly different from India.\r\n\r\nApril 22.  To such as believe that the quaint product called French\r\ncivilization would be an improvement upon the civilization of New Guinea\r\nand the like, the snatching of Madagascar and the laying on of French\r\ncivilization there will be fully justified.  But why did the English\r\nallow the French to have Madagascar?  Did she respect a theft of a couple\r\nof centuries ago?  Dear me, robbery by European nations of each other's\r\nterritories has never been a sin, is not a sin to-day.  To the several\r\ncabinets the several political establishments of the world are\r\nclotheslines; and a large part of the official duty of these cabinets is\r\nto keep an eye on each other's wash and grab what they can of it as\r\nopportunity offers.  All the territorial possessions of all the political\r\nestablishments in the earth--including America, of course--consist of\r\npilferings from other people's wash.  No tribe, howsoever insignificant,\r\nand no nation, howsoever mighty, occupies a foot of land that was not\r\nstolen.  When the English, the French, and the Spaniards reached America,\r\nthe Indian tribes had been raiding each other's territorial clothes-lines\r\nfor ages, and every acre of ground in the continent had been stolen and\r\nre-stolen 500 times.  The English, the French, and the Spaniards went to\r\nwork and stole it all over again; and when that was satisfactorily\r\naccomplished they went diligently to work and stole it from each other.\r\nIn Europe and Asia and Africa every acre of ground has been stolen\r\nseveral millions of times.  A crime persevered in a thousand centuries\r\nceases to be a crime, and becomes a virtue.  This is the law of custom,\r\nand custom supersedes all other forms of law.  Christian governments are\r\nas frank to-day, as open and above-board, in discussing projects for\r\nraiding each other's clothes-lines as ever they were before the Golden\r\nRule came smiling into this inhospitable world and couldn't get a night's\r\nlodging anywhere.  In 150 years England has beneficently retired garment\r\nafter garment from the Indian lines, until there is hardly a rag of the\r\noriginal wash left dangling anywhere.  In 800 years an obscure\r\ntribe of Muscovite savages has risen to the dazzling position of\r\nLand-Robber-in-Chief; she found a quarter of the world hanging out to dry\r\non a hundred parallels of latitude, and she scooped in the whole wash.\r\nShe keeps a sharp eye on a multitude of little lines that stretch along\r\nthe northern boundaries of India, and every now and then she snatches a\r\nhip-rag or a pair of pyjamas.  It is England's prospective property, and\r\nRussia knows it; but Russia cares nothing for that.  In fact, in our day\r\nland-robbery, claim-jumping, is become a European governmental frenzy.\r\nSome have been hard at it in the borders of China, in Burma, in Siam, and\r\nthe islands of the sea; and all have been at it in Africa.  Africa has\r\nbeen as coolly divided up and portioned out among the gang as if they had\r\nbought it and paid for it.  And now straightway they are beginning the\r\nold game again--to steal each other's grabbings.  Germany found a vast\r\nslice of Central Africa with the English flag and the English missionary\r\nand the English trader scattered all over it, but with certain\r\nformalities neglected--no signs up, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep off the grass,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cTrespassers-forbidden,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.--and she stepped in with a cold calm smile\r\nand put up the signs herself, and swept those English pioneers promptly\r\nout of the country.\r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous point there.  It can be put into the form of a\r\nmaxim: Get your formalities right--never mind about the moralities.\r\n\r\nIt was an impudent thing; but England had to put up with it.  Now, in the\r\ncase of Madagascar, the formalities had originally been observed, but by\r\nneglect they had fallen into desuetude ages ago.  England should have\r\nsnatched Madagascar from the French clothes-line.  Without an effort she\r\ncould have saved those harmless natives from the calamity of French\r\ncivilization, and she did not do it.  Now it is too late.\r\n\r\nThe signs of the times show plainly enough what is going to happen.  All\r\nthe savage lands in the world are going to be brought under subjection to\r\nthe Christian governments of Europe.  I am not sorry, but glad.  This\r\ncoming fate might have been a calamity to those savage peoples two\r\nhundred years ago; but now it will in some cases be a benefaction.  The\r\nsooner the seizure is consummated, the better for the savages.\r\n\r\nThe dreary and dragging ages of bloodshed and disorder and oppression\r\nwill give place to peace and order and the reign of law.  When one\r\nconsiders what India was under her Hindoo and Mohammedan rulers, and what\r\nshe is now; when he remembers the miseries of her millions then and the\r\nprotections and humanities which they enjoy now, he must concede that the\r\nmost fortunate thing that has ever befallen that empire was the\r\nestablishment of British supremacy there.  The savage lands of the world\r\nare to pass to alien possession, their peoples to the mercies of alien\r\nrulers.  Let us hope and believe that they will all benefit by the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nApril 23.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe first year they gather shells; the second year they\r\ngather shells and drink; the third year they do not gather shells.\xe2\x80\x9d (Said\r\nof immigrants to Mauritius.)\r\n\r\nPopulation 375,000.  120 sugar factories.\r\n\r\nPopulation 1851, 185,000.  The increase is due mainly to the introduction\r\nof Indian coolies.  They now apparently form the great majority of the\r\npopulation.  They are admirable breeders; their homes are always hazy\r\nwith children.  Great savers of money.  A British officer told me that in\r\nIndia he paid his servant 10 rupees a month, and he had 11 cousins,\r\nuncles, parents, etc., dependent upon him, and he supported them on his\r\nwages.  These thrifty coolies are said to be acquiring land a trifle at a\r\ntime, and cultivating it; and may own the island by and by.\r\n\r\nThe Indian women do very hard labor for wages running from  40 one\r\nhundredths of a rupee for twelve hours' work to 50 one hundredths of a\r\nrupee. They carry mats of sugar on their heads (70 pounds) all\r\nday lading ships, for half a rupee, and work at gardening all day for\r\nless.\r\n\r\nThe camaron is a fresh water creature like a cray-fish.  It is regarded\r\nhere as the world's chiefest delicacy--and certainly it is good.  Guards\r\npatrol the streams to prevent poaching it.  A fine of Rs.200 or 300\r\n(they say) for poaching.  Bait is thrown in the water; the camaron goes\r\nfor it; the fisher drops his loop in and works it around and about the\r\ncamaron he has selected, till he gets it over its tail; then there's a\r\njerk or something to certify the camaron that it is his turn now; he\r\nsuddenly backs away, which moves the loop still further up his person and\r\ndraws it taut, and his days are ended.\r\n\r\nAnother dish, called palmiste, is like raw turnip-shavings and tastes\r\nlike green almonds; is very delicate and good.  Costs the life of a palm\r\ntree 12 to 20 years old--for it is the pith.\r\n\r\nAnother dish--looks like greens or a tangle of fine seaweed--is a\r\npreparation of the deadly nightshade.  Good enough.\r\n\r\nThe monkeys live in the dense forests on the flanks of the toy mountains,\r\nand they flock down nights and raid the sugar-fields.  Also on other\r\nestates they come down and destroy a sort of bean-crop--just for fun,\r\napparently--tear off the pods and throw them down.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone of 1892 tore down two great blocks of stone buildings in the\r\ncenter of Port Louis--the chief architectural feature--and left the\r\nuncomely and apparently frail blocks standing.  Everywhere in its track\r\nit annihilated houses, tore off roofs, destroyed trees and crops.  The\r\nmen were in the towns, the women and children at home in the country\r\ngetting crippled, killed, frightened to insanity; and the rain deluging\r\nthem, the wind howling, the thunder crashing, the lightning glaring.\r\nThis for an hour or so.  Then a lull and sunshine; many ventured out of\r\nsafe shelter; then suddenly here it came again from the opposite point\r\nand renewed and completed the devastation.  It is said the Chinese fed\r\nthe sufferers for days on free rice.\r\n\r\nWhole streets in Port Louis were laid flat--wrecked.  During a minute and\r\na half the wind blew 123 miles an hour; no official record made after\r\nthat, when it may have reached 150.  It cut down an obelisk.  It carried\r\nan American ship into the woods after breaking the chains of two anchors.\r\nThey now use four-two forward, two astern.  Common report says it killed\r\n1,200 in Port Louis alone, in half an hour.  Then came the lull of the\r\ncentral calm--people did not know the barometer was still going down\r\n--then suddenly all perdition broke loose again while people were rushing\r\naround seeking friends and rescuing the wounded.  The noise was\r\ncomparable to nothing; there is nothing resembling it but thunder and\r\ncannon, and these are feeble in comparison.\r\n\r\nWhat there is of Mauritius is beautiful.  You have undulating wide\r\nexpanses of sugar-cane--a fine, fresh green and very pleasant to the eye;\r\nand everywhere else you have a ragged luxuriance of tropic vegetation of\r\nvivid greens of varying shades, a wild tangle of underbrush, with\r\ngraceful tall palms lifting their crippled plumes high above it; and you\r\nhave stretches of shady dense forest with limpid streams frolicking\r\nthrough them, continually glimpsed and lost and glimpsed again in the\r\npleasantest hide-and-seek fashion; and you have some tiny mountains,\r\nsome quaint and picturesque groups of toy peaks, and a dainty little\r\nvest-pocket Matterhorn; and here and there and now and then a strip of\r\nsea with a white ruffle of surf breaks into the view.\r\n\r\nThat is Mauritius; and pretty enough.  The details are few, the massed\r\nresult is charming, but not imposing; not riotous, not exciting; it is a\r\nSunday landscape.  Perspective, and the enchantments wrought by distance,\r\nare wanting.  There are no distances; there is no perspective, so to\r\nspeak.  Fifteen miles as the crow flies is the usual limit of vision.\r\nMauritius is a garden and a park combined.  It affects one's emotions as\r\nparks and gardens affect them.  The surfaces of one's spiritual deeps are\r\npleasantly played upon, the deeps themselves are not reached, not\r\nstirred.  Spaciousness, remote altitudes, the sense of mystery which\r\nhaunts apparently inaccessible mountain domes and summits reposing in the\r\nsky--these are the things which exalt the spirit and move it to see\r\nvisions and dream dreams.\r\n\r\nThe Sandwich Islands remain my ideal of the perfect thing in the matter\r\nof tropical islands.  I would add another story to Mauna Loa's 16,000\r\nfeet if I could, and make it particularly bold and steep and craggy and\r\nforbidding and snowy; and I would make the volcano spout its lava-floods\r\nout of its summit instead of its sides; but aside from these\r\nnon-essentials I have no corrections to suggest.  I hope these will be\r\nattended to; I do not wish to have to speak of it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nWhen your watch gets out of order you have choice of two things to do:\r\nthrow it in the fire or take it to the watch-tinker.  The former is the\r\nquickest.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe Arundel Castle is the finest boat I have seen in these seas.  She is\r\nthoroughly modern, and that statement covers a great deal of ground.  She\r\nhas the usual defect, the common defect, the universal defect, the defect\r\nthat has never been missing from any ship that ever sailed--she has\r\nimperfect beds.  Many ships have good beds, but no ship has very good\r\nones.  In the matter of beds all ships have been badly edited, ignorantly\r\nedited, from the beginning.  The selection of the beds is given to some\r\nhearty, strong-backed, self-made man, when it ought to be given to a\r\nfrail woman accustomed from girlhood to backaches and insomnia.  Nothing\r\nis so rare, on either side of the ocean, as a perfect bed; nothing is so\r\ndifficult to make.  Some of the hotels on both sides provide it, but no\r\nship ever does or ever did.  In Noah's Ark the beds were simply\r\nscandalous.  Noah set the fashion, and it will endure in one degree of\r\nmodification or another till the next flood.\r\n\r\n8 A.M.  Passing Isle de Bourbon.  Broken-up sky-line of volcanic\r\nmountains in the middle.  Surely it would not cost much to repair them,\r\nand it seems inexcusable neglect to leave them as they are.\r\n\r\nIt seems stupid to send tired men to Europe to rest.  It is no proper\r\nrest for the mind to clatter from town to town in the dust and cinders,\r\nand examine galleries and architecture, and be always meeting people and\r\nlunching and teaing and dining, and receiving worrying cables and\r\nletters.  And a sea voyage on the Atlantic is of no use--voyage too\r\nshort, sea too rough.  The peaceful Indian and Pacific Oceans and the\r\nlong stretches of time are the healing thing.\r\n\r\nMay 2, AM.  A fair, great ship in sight, almost the first we have seen in\r\nthese weeks of lonely voyaging.  We are now in the Mozambique Channel,\r\nbetween Madagascar and South Africa, sailing straight west for Delagoa\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nLast night, the burly chief engineer, middle-aged, was standing telling a\r\nspirited seafaring tale, and had reached the most exciting place, where a\r\nman overboard was washing swiftly astern on the great seas, and uplifting\r\ndespairing cries, everybody racing aft in a frenzy of excitement and\r\nfading hope, when the band, which had been silent a moment, began\r\nimpressively its closing piece, the English national anthem.  As simply\r\nas if he was unconscious of what he was doing, he stopped his story,\r\nuncovered, laid his laced cap against his breast, and slightly bent his\r\ngrizzled head.  The few bars finished, he put on his cap and took up his\r\ntale again, as naturally as if that interjection of music had been a part\r\nof it.  There was something touching and fine about it, and it was moving\r\nto reflect that he was one of a myriad, scattered over every part of the\r\nglobe, who by turn was doing as he was doing every hour of the\r\ntwenty-four--those awake doing it while the others slept--those\r\nimpressive bars forever floating up out of the various climes, never\r\nsilent and never lacking reverent listeners.\r\n\r\nAll that I remember about Madagascar is that Thackeray's little Billie\r\nwent up to the top of the mast and there knelt him upon his knee, saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\r\n\r\n               \xe2\x80\x9cJerusalem and Madagascar,\r\n               And North and South Amerikee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMay 3.  Sunday.  Fifteen or twenty Africanders who will end their voyage\r\nto-day and strike for their several homes from Delagoa Bay to-morrow, sat\r\nup singing on the afterdeck in the moonlight till 3 A.M.  Good fun and\r\nwholesome.  And the songs were clean songs, and some of them were\r\nhallowed by tender associations.  Finally, in a pause, a man asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou heard about the fellow that kept a diary crossing the Atlantic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n It was a discord, a wet blanket.  The men were not in the mood for\r\nhumorous dirt.  The songs had carried them to their homes, and in spirit\r\nthey sat by those far hearthstones, and saw faces and heard voices other\r\nthan those that were about them.  And so this disposition to drag in an\r\nold indecent anecdote got no welcome; nobody answered.  The poor man\r\nhadn't wit enough to see that he had blundered, but asked his question\r\nagain.  Again there was no response.  It was embarrassing for him.  In\r\nhis confusion he chose the wrong course, did the wrong thing--began the\r\nanecdote.  Began it in a deep and hostile stillness, where had been such\r\nlife and stir and warm comradeship before.  He delivered himself of the\r\nbrief details of the diary's first day, and did it with some confidence\r\nand a fair degree of eagerness.  It fell flat.  There was an awkward\r\npause.  The two rows of men sat like statues.  There was no movement, no\r\nsound.  He had to go on; there was no other way, at least none that an\r\nanimal of his calibre could think of.  At the close of each day's diary,\r\nthe same dismal silence followed.  When at last he finished his tale and\r\nsprung the indelicate surprise which is wont to fetch a crash of\r\nlaughter, not a ripple of sound resulted.  It was as if the tale had been\r\ntold to dead men.  After what seemed a long, long time, somebody sighed,\r\nsomebody else stirred in his seat; presently, the men dropped into a low\r\nmurmur of confidential talk, each with his neighbor, and the incident was\r\nclosed.  There were indications that that man was fond of his anecdote;\r\nthat it was his pet, his standby, his shot that never missed, his\r\nreputation-maker.  But he will never tell it again.  No doubt he will\r\nthink of it sometimes, for that cannot well be helped; and then he will\r\nsee a picture, and always the same picture--the double rank of dead men;\r\nthe vacant deck stretching away in dimming perspective beyond them, the\r\nwide desert of smooth sea all abroad; the rim of the moon spying from\r\nbehind a rag of black cloud; the remote top of the mizzenmast shearing a\r\nzigzag path through the fields of stars in the deeps of space; and this\r\nsoft picture will remind him of the time that he sat in the midst of it\r\nand told his poor little tale and felt so lonesome when he got through.\r\n\r\nFifty Indians and Chinamen asleep in a big tent in the waist of the ship\r\nforward; they lie side by side with no space between; the former wrapped\r\nup, head and all, as in the Indian streets, the Chinamen uncovered; the\r\nlamp and things for opium smoking in the center.\r\n\r\nA passenger said it was ten 2-ton truck loads of dynamite that lately\r\nexploded at Johannesburg.  Hundreds killed; he doesn't know how many;\r\nlimbs picked up for miles around.  Glass shattered, and roofs swept away\r\nor collapsed 200 yards off; fragment of iron flung three and a half\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt occurred at 3 p.m.; at 6, L65,000 had been subscribed.  When this\r\npassenger left, L35,000 had been voted by city and state governments and\r\nL100,000 by citizens and business corporations.  When news of the\r\ndisaster was telephoned to the Exchange L35,000 were subscribed in the\r\nfirst five minutes.  Subscribing was still going on when he left; the\r\npapers had ceased the names, only the amounts--too many names; not enough\r\nroom.  L100,000 subscribed by companies and citizens; if this is true, it\r\nmust be what they call in Australia \xe2\x80\x9ca record\xe2\x80\x9d--the biggest instance of a\r\nspontaneous outpour for charity in history, considering the size of the\r\npopulation it was drawn from, $8 or $10 for each white resident, babies\r\nat the breast included.\r\n\r\nMonday, May 4.  Steaming slowly in the stupendous Delagoa Bay, its dim\r\narms stretching far away and disappearing on both sides.  It could\r\nfurnish plenty of room for all the ships in the world, but it is shoal.\r\nThe lead has given us 3 1/2 fathoms several times and we are drawing\r\nthat, lacking 6 inches.\r\n\r\nA bold headland--precipitous wall, 150 feet high, very strong, red color,\r\nstretching a mile or so.  A man said it was Portuguese blood--battle\r\nfought here with the natives last year.  I think this doubtful.  Pretty\r\ncluster of houses on the tableland above the red--and rolling stretches\r\nof grass and groups of trees, like England.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese have the railroad (one passenger train a day) to the\r\nborder--70 miles--then the Netherlands Company have it.  Thousands of\r\ntons of freight on the shore--no cover.  This is Portuguese allover\r\n--indolence, piousness, poverty, impotence.\r\n\r\nCrews of small boats and tugs, all jet black woolly heads and very\r\nmuscular.\r\n\r\nWinter.  The South African winter is just beginning now, but nobody but\r\nan expert can tell it from summer.  However, I am tired of summer; we\r\nhave had it unbroken for eleven months.  We spent the afternoon on shore,\r\nDelagoa Bay.  A small town--no sights.  No carriages.  Three 'rickshas,\r\nbut we couldn't get them--apparently private.  These Portuguese are a\r\nrich brown, like some of the Indians.  Some of the blacks have the long\r\nhorse heads and very long chins of the negroes of the picture books; but\r\nmost of them are exactly like the negroes of our Southern States round\r\nfaces, flat noses, good-natured, and easy laughers.\r\n\r\nFlocks of black women passed along, carrying outrageously heavy bags of\r\nfreight on their heads. The quiver of their leg as the foot was planted\r\nand the strain exhibited by their bodies showed what a tax upon their\r\nstrength the load was.  They were stevedores and doing full stevedore's\r\nwork.  They were very erect when unladden--from carrying weights on\r\ntheir heads--just like the Indian women. It gives them a proud fine\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nSometimes one saw a woman carrying on her head a laden and top-heavy\r\nbasket the shape of an inverted pyramid--its top the size of a soup-\r\nplate, its base the diameter of a teacup.  It required nice balancing--\r\nand got it.\r\n\r\nNo bright colors; yet there were a good many Hindoos.\r\n\r\nThe Second Class Passenger came over as usual at \xe2\x80\x9clights out\xe2\x80\x9d (11) and we\r\nlounged along the spacious vague solitudes of the deck and smoked the\r\npeaceful pipe and talked.  He told me an incident in Mr. Barnum's life\r\nwhich was evidently characteristic of that great showman in several ways:\r\n\r\nThis was Barnum's purchase of Shakespeare's birthplace, a quarter of a\r\ncentury ago.  The Second Class Passenger was in Jamrach's employ at the\r\ntime and knew Barnum well.  He said the thing began in this way.  One\r\nmorning Barnum and Jamrach were in Jamrach's little private snuggery back\r\nof the wilderness of caged monkeys and snakes and other commonplaces of\r\nJamrach's stock in trade, refreshing themselves after an arduous stroke\r\nof business, Jamrach with something orthodox, Barnum with something\r\nheterodox--for Barnum was a teetotaler.  The stroke of business was in\r\nthe elephant line.  Jamrach had contracted to deliver to Barnum in New\r\nYork 18 elephants for $360,000 in time for the next season's opening.\r\nThen it occurred to Mr. Barnum that he needed a \xe2\x80\x9ccard.\xe2\x80\x9d He suggested\r\nJumbo.  Jamrach said he would have to think of something else--Jumbo\r\ncouldn't be had; the Zoo wouldn't part with that elephant.  Barnum said\r\nhe was willing to pay a fortune for Jumbo if he could get him.  Jamrach\r\nsaid it was no use to think about it; that Jumbo was as popular as the\r\nPrince of Wales and the Zoo wouldn't dare to sell him; all England would\r\nbe outraged at the idea; Jumbo was an English institution; he was part of\r\nthe national glory; one might as well think of buying the Nelson\r\nmonument.  Barnum spoke up with vivacity and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt's a first-rate idea.  I'll buy the Monument.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJamrach was speechless for a second.  Then he said, like one ashamed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou caught me.  I was napping.  For a moment I thought you were in\r\nearnest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBarnum said pleasantly--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in earnest.  I know they won't sell it, but no matter, I will not\r\nthrow away a good idea for all that.  All I want is a big advertisement.\r\nI will keep the thing in mind, and if nothing better turns up I will\r\noffer to buy it.  That will answer every purpose.  It will furnish me a\r\ncouple of columns of gratis advertising in every English and American\r\npaper for a couple of months, and give my show the biggest boom a show\r\never had in this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJamrach started to deliver a burst of admiration, but was interrupted by\r\nBarnum, who said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is a state of things!  England ought to blush.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis eye had fallen upon something in the newspaper.  He read it through\r\nto himself, then read it aloud.  It said that the house that Shakespeare\r\nwas born in at Stratford-on-Avon was falling gradually to ruin through\r\nneglect; that the room where the poet first saw the light was now serving\r\nas a butcher's shop; that all appeals to England to contribute money (the\r\nrequisite sum stated) to buy and repair the house and place it in the\r\ncare of salaried and trustworthy keepers had fallen resultless.  Then\r\nBarnum said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere's my chance.  Let Jumbo and the Monument alone for the present\r\n--they'll keep.  I'll buy Shakespeare's house.  I'll set it up in my\r\nMuseum in New York and put a glass case around it and make a sacred thing\r\nof it; and you'll see all America flock there to worship; yes, and\r\npilgrims from the whole earth; and I'll make them take their hats off,\r\ntoo.  In America we know how to value anything that Shakespeare's touch\r\nhas made holy. You'll see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the S. C. P.  said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the way the thing came about.  Barnum did buy Shakespeare's\r\nhouse.  He paid the price asked, and received the properly attested\r\ndocuments of sale.  Then there was an explosion, I can tell you.  England\r\nrose!  What, the birthplace of the master-genius of all the ages and all\r\nthe climes--that priceless possession of Britain--to be carted out of the\r\ncountry like so much old lumber and set up for sixpenny desecration in a\r\nYankee show-shop--the idea was not to be tolerated for a moment.  England\r\nrose in her indignation; and Barnum was glad to relinquish his prize and\r\noffer apologies.  However, he stood out for a compromise; he claimed a\r\nconcession--England must let him have Jumbo.  And England consented, but\r\nnot cheerfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt shows how, by help of time, a story can grow--even after Barnum has\r\nhad the first innings in the telling of it.  Mr. Barnum told me the story\r\nhimself, years ago.  He said that the permission to buy Jumbo was not a\r\nconcession; the purchase was made and the animal delivered before the\r\npublic knew anything about it.  Also, that the securing of Jumbo was all\r\nthe advertisement he needed.  It produced many columns of newspaper talk,\r\nfree of cost, and he was satisfied.  He said that if he had failed to get\r\nJumbo he would have caused his notion of buying the Nelson Monument to be\r\ntreacherously smuggled into print by some trusty friend, and after he had\r\ngotten a few hundred pages of gratuitous advertising out of it, he would\r\nhave come out with a blundering, obtuse, but warm-hearted letter of\r\napology, and in a postscript to it would have naively proposed to let the\r\nMonument go, and take Stonehenge in place of it at the same price.\r\n\r\nIt was his opinion that such a letter, written with well-simulated\r\nasinine innocence and gush would have gotten his ignorance and stupidity\r\nan amount of newspaper abuse worth six fortunes to him, and not\r\npurchasable for twice the money.\r\n\r\nI knew Mr. Barnum well, and I placed every confidence in the account\r\nwhich he gave me of the Shakespeare birthplace episode.  He said he found\r\nthe house neglected and going-to decay, and he inquired into the matter\r\nand was told that many times earnest efforts had been made to raise money\r\nfor its proper repair and preservation, but without success.  He then\r\nproposed to buy it.  The proposition was entertained, and a price named\r\n--$50,000, I think; but whatever it was, Barnum paid the money down,\r\nwithout remark, and the papers were drawn up and executed.  He said that\r\nit had been his purpose to set up the house in his Museum, keep it in\r\nrepair, protect it from name-scribblers and other desecrators, and leave\r\nit by bequest to the safe and perpetual guardianship of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitute at Washington.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as it was found that Shakespeare's house had passed into\r\nforeign hands and was going to be carried across the ocean, England was\r\nstirred as no appeal from the custodians of the relic had ever stirred\r\nEngland before, and protests came flowing in--and money, too, to stop the\r\noutrage.  Offers of repurchase were made--offers of double the money that\r\nMr. Barnum had paid for the house.  He handed the house back, but took\r\nonly the sum which it had cost him--but on the condition that an\r\nendowment sufficient for the future safeguarding and maintenance of the\r\nsacred relic should be raised.  This condition was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThat was Barnum's account of the episode; and to the end of his days he\r\nclaimed with pride and satisfaction that not England, but America\r\n--represented by him--saved the birthplace of Shakespeare from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nAt 3 P.M., May 6th, the ship slowed down, off the land, and thoughtfully\r\nand cautiously picked her way into the snug harbor of Durban, South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nIn statesmanship get the formalities right, never mind about the\r\nmoralities.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nFROM DIARY:\r\n\r\nRoyal Hotel.  Comfortable, good table, good service of natives and\r\nMadrasis.  Curious jumble of modern and ancient city and village,\r\nprimitiveness and the other thing.  Electric bells, but they don't ring.\r\nAsked why they didn't, the watchman in the office said he thought they\r\nmust be out of order; he thought so because some of them rang, but most\r\nof them didn't.  Wouldn't it be a good idea to put them in order?  He\r\nhesitated--like one who isn't quite sure--then conceded the point.\r\n\r\nMay 7.  A bang on the door at 6.  Did I want my boots cleaned?  Fifteen\r\nminutes later another bang.  Did we want coffee?  Fifteen later, bang\r\nagain, my wife's bath ready; 15 later, my bath ready.  Two other bangs;\r\nI forget what they were about.  Then lots of shouting back and forth,\r\namong the servants just as in an Indian hotel.\r\n\r\nEvening.  At 4 P.M.  it was unpleasantly warm.  Half-hour after sunset\r\none needed a spring overcoat; by 8 a winter one.\r\n\r\nDurban is a neat and clean town.  One notices that without having his\r\nattention called to it.\r\n\r\nRickshaws drawn by splendidly built black Zulus, so overflowing with\r\nstrength, seemingly, that it is a pleasure, not a pain, to see them\r\nsnatch a rickshaw along.  They smile and laugh and show their teeth--a\r\ngood-natured lot.  Not allowed to drink; 2s per hour for one person; 3s\r\nfor two; 3d for a course--one person.\r\n\r\nThe chameleon in the hotel court.  He is fat and indolent and\r\ncontemplative; but is business-like and capable when a fly comes about\r\n--reaches out a tongue like a teaspoon and takes him in.  He gums his\r\ntongue first.  He is always pious, in his looks.  And pious and thankful\r\nboth, when Providence or one of us sends him a fly.  He has a froggy\r\nhead, and a back like a new grave--for shape; and hands like a bird's\r\ntoes that have been frostbitten.  But his eyes are his exhibition\r\nfeature.  A couple of skinny cones project from the sides of his head,\r\nwith a wee shiny bead of an eye set in the apex of each; and these cones\r\nturn bodily like pivot-guns and point every-which-way, and they are\r\nindependent of each other; each has its own exclusive machinery.  When I\r\nam behind him and C. in front of him, he whirls one eye rearwards and the\r\nother forwards--which gives him a most Congressional expression (one eye\r\non the constituency and one on the swag); and then if something happens\r\nabove and below him he shoots out one eye upward like a telescope and the\r\nother downward--and this changes his expression, but does not improve it.\r\n\r\nNatives must not be out after the curfew bell without a pass.  In Natal\r\nthere are ten blacks to one white.\r\n\r\nSturdy plump creatures are the women.  They comb their wool up to a peak\r\nand keep it in position by stiffening it with brown-red clay--half of\r\nthis tower colored, denotes engagement; the whole of it colored denotes\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nNone but heathen Zulus on the police; Christian ones not allowed.\r\n\r\nMay 9.  A drive yesterday with friends over the Berea.  Very fine roads\r\nand lofty, overlooking the whole town, the harbor, and the sea-beautiful\r\nviews.  Residences all along, set in the midst of green lawns with shrubs\r\nand generally one or two intensely red outbursts of poinsettia--the\r\nflaming splotch of blinding red a stunning contrast with the world of\r\nsurrounding green.  The cactus tree--candelabrum-like; and one twisted\r\nlike gray writhing serpents.  The \xe2\x80\x9cflat-crown\xe2\x80\x9d (should be flat-roof)\r\n--half a dozen naked branches full of elbows, slant upward like\r\nartificial\r\nsupports, and fling a roof of delicate foliage out in a horizontal\r\nplatform as flat as a floor; and you look up through this thin floor as\r\nthrough a green cobweb or veil.  The branches are japanesich.  All about\r\nyou is a bewildering variety of unfamiliar and beautiful trees; one sort\r\nwonderfully dense foliage and very dark green--so dark that you notice it\r\nat once, notwithstanding there are so many orange trees.  The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cflamboyant\xe2\x80\x9d--not in flower, now, but when in flower lives up to its\r\nname, we are told.  Another tree with a lovely upright tassel scattered\r\namong its rich greenery, red and glowing as a firecoal.  Here and there a\r\ngum-tree; half a dozen lofty Norfolk Island pines lifting their fronded\r\narms skyward.  Groups of tall bamboo.\r\n\r\nSaw one bird.  Not many birds here, and they have no music--and the\r\nflowers not much smell, they grow so fast.\r\n\r\nEverything neat and trim and clean like the town.  The loveliest trees\r\nand the greatest variety I have ever seen anywhere, except approaching\r\nDarjeeling.  Have not heard anyone call Natal the garden of South Africa,\r\nbut that is what it probably is.\r\n\r\nIt was when Bishop of Natal that Colenso raised such a storm in the\r\nreligious world.  The concerns of religion are a vital matter here yet.\r\nA vigilant eye is kept upon Sunday.  Museums and other dangerous resorts\r\nare not allowed to be open.  You may sail on the Bay, but it is wicked to\r\nplay cricket.  For a while a Sunday concert was tolerated, upon condition\r\nthat it must be admission free and the money taken by collection.  But\r\nthe collection was alarmingly large and that stopped the matter.  They\r\nare particular about babies.  A clergyman would not bury a child\r\naccording to the sacred rites because it had not been baptized.  The\r\nHindoo is more liberal.  He burns no child under three, holding that it\r\ndoes not need purifying.\r\n\r\nThe King of the Zulus, a fine fellow of 30, was banished six years ago\r\nfor a term of seven years.  He is occupying Napoleon's old stand--St.\r\nHelena.  The people are a little nervous about having him come back, and\r\nthey may well be, for Zulu kings have been terrible people sometimes\r\n--like Tchaka, Dingaan, and Cetewayo.\r\n\r\nThere is a large Trappist monastery two hours from Durban, over the\r\ncountry roads, and in company with Mr. Milligan and Mr. Hunter, general\r\nmanager of the Natal government railways, who knew the heads of it, we\r\nwent out to see it.\r\n\r\nThere it all was, just as one reads about it in books and cannot believe\r\nthat it is so--I mean the rough, hard work, the impossible hours, the\r\nscanty food, the coarse raiment, the Maryborough beds, the tabu of human\r\nspeech, of social intercourse, of relaxation, of amusement, of\r\nentertainment, of the presence of woman in the men's establishment.\r\nThere it all was.  It was not a dream, it was not a lie.  And yet with\r\nthe fact before one's face it was still incredible.  It is such a\r\nsweeping suppression of human instincts, such an extinction of the man as\r\nan individual.\r\n\r\nLa Trappe must have known the human race well.  The scheme which he\r\ninvented hunts out everything that a man wants and values--and withholds\r\nit from him.  Apparently there is no detail that can help make life worth\r\nliving that has not been carefully ascertained and placed out of the\r\nTrappist's reach.  La Trappe must have known that there were men who\r\nwould enjoy this kind of misery, but how did he find it out?\r\n\r\nIf he had consulted you or me he would have been told that his scheme\r\nlacked too many attractions; that it was impossible; that it could never\r\nbe floated.  But there in the monastery was proof that he knew the human\r\nrace better than it knew itself.  He set his foot upon every desire that\r\na man has--yet he floated his project, and it has prospered for two\r\nhundred years, and will go on prospering forever, no doubt.\r\n\r\nMan likes personal distinction--there in the monastery it is obliterated.\r\nHe likes delicious food--there he gets beans and bread and tea, and not\r\nenough of it.  He likes to lie softly--there he lies on a sand mattress,\r\nand has a pillow and a blanket, but no sheet.  When he is dining, in a\r\ngreat company of friends, he likes to laugh and chat--there a monk reads\r\na holy book aloud during meals, and nobody speaks or laughs.  When a man\r\nhas a hundred friends about him, evenings, he likes to have a good time\r\nand run late--there he and the rest go silently to bed at 8; and in the\r\ndark, too; there is but a loose brown robe to discard, there are no\r\nnight-clothes to put on, a light is not needed.  Man likes to lie abed\r\nlate--there he gets up once or twice in the night to perform some\r\nreligious office, and gets up finally for the day at two in the morning.\r\nMan likes light work or none at all--there he labors all day in the\r\nfield, or in the blacksmith shop or the other shops devoted to the\r\nmechanical trades, such as shoemaking, saddlery, carpentry, and so on.\r\nMan likes the society of girls and women--there he never has it.  He\r\nlikes to have his children about him, and pet them and play with them\r\n--there he has none.  He likes billiards--there is no table there.  He\r\nlikes outdoor sports and indoor dramatic and musical and social\r\nentertainments--there are none there.  He likes to bet on things--I was\r\ntold that betting is forbidden there.  When a man's temper is up he likes\r\nto pour it out upon somebody there this is not allowed.  A man likes\r\nanimals--pets; there are none there.  He likes to smoke--there he cannot\r\ndo it.  He likes to read the news--no papers or magazines come there.  A\r\nman likes to know how his parents and brothers and sisters are getting\r\nalong when he is away, and if they miss him--there he cannot know.  A man\r\nlikes a pretty house, and pretty furniture, and pretty things, and pretty\r\ncolors--there he has nothing but naked aridity and sombre colors.  A man\r\nlikes--name it yourself: whatever it is, it is absent from that place.\r\n\r\nFrom what I could learn, all that a man gets for this is merely the\r\nsaving of his soul.\r\n\r\nIt all seems strange, incredible, impossible.  But La Trappe knew the\r\nrace.  He knew the powerful attraction of unattractiveness; he knew that\r\nno life could be imagined, howsoever comfortless and forbidding, but\r\nsomebody would want to try it.\r\n\r\nThis parent establishment of Germans began its work fifteen years ago,\r\nstrangers, poor, and unencouraged; it owns 15,000 acres of land now, and\r\nraises grain and fruit, and makes wines, and manufactures all manner of\r\nthings, and has native apprentices in its shops, and sends them forth\r\nable to read and write, and also well equipped to earn their living by\r\ntheir trades.  And this young establishment has set up eleven branches in\r\nSouth Africa, and in them they are christianizing and educating and\r\nteaching wage-yielding mechanical trades to 1,200 boys and girls.\r\nProtestant Missionary work is coldly regarded by the commercial white\r\ncolonist all over the heathen world, as a rule, and its product is\r\nnicknamed \xe2\x80\x9crice-Christians\xe2\x80\x9d (occupationless incapables who join the\r\nchurch for revenue only), but I think it would be difficult to pick a\r\nflaw in the work of these Catholic monks, and I believe that the\r\ndisposition to attempt it has not shown itself.\r\n\r\nTuesday, May 12.  Transvaal politics in a confused condition.  First the\r\nsentencing of the Johannesburg Reformers startled England by its\r\nseverity; on the top of this came Kruger's exposure of the cipher\r\ncorrespondence, which showed that the invasion of the Transvaal, with the\r\ndesign of seizing that country and adding it to the British Empire, was\r\nplanned by Cecil Rhodes and Beit--which made a revulsion in English\r\nfeeling, and brought out a storm against Rhodes and the Chartered Company\r\nfor degrading British honor.  For a good while I couldn't seem to get at\r\na clear comprehension of it, it was so tangled.  But at last by patient\r\nstudy I have managed it, I believe.  As I understand it, the Uitlanders\r\nand other Dutchmen were dissatisfied because the English would not allow\r\nthem to take any part in the government except to pay taxes.  Next, as I\r\nunderstand it, Dr. Kruger and Dr. Jameson, not having been able to make\r\nthe medical business pay, made a raid into Matabeleland with the\r\nintention of capturing the capital, Johannesburg, and holding the women\r\nand children to ransom until the Uitlanders and the other Boers should\r\ngrant to them and the Chartered Company the political rights which had\r\nbeen withheld from them.  They would have succeeded in this great scheme,\r\nas I understand it, but for the interference of Cecil Rhodes and Mr.\r\nBeit, and other Chiefs of the Matabele, who persuaded their countrymen to\r\nrevolt and throw off their allegiance to Germany.  This, in turn, as I\r\nunderstand it, provoked the King of Abyssinia to destroy the Italian army\r\nand fall back upon Johannesburg; this at the instigation of Rhodes, to\r\nbull the stock market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nEvery one is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nWhen I scribbled in my note-book a year ago the paragraph which ends the\r\npreceding chapter, it was meant to indicate, in an extravagant form, two\r\nthings: the conflicting nature of the information conveyed by the citizen\r\nto the stranger concerning South African politics, and the resulting\r\nconfusion created in the stranger's mind thereby.\r\n\r\nBut it does not seem so very extravagant now.  Nothing could in that\r\ndisturbed and excited time make South African politics clear or quite\r\nrational to the citizen of the country because his personal interest and\r\nhis political prejudices were in his way; and nothing could make those\r\npolitics clear or rational to the stranger, the sources of his\r\ninformation being such as they were.\r\n\r\nI was in South Africa some little time.  When I arrived there the\r\npolitical pot was boiling fiercely.  Four months previously, Jameson had\r\nplunged over the Transvaal border with about 600 armed horsemen at his\r\nback, to go to the \xe2\x80\x9crelief of the women and children\xe2\x80\x9d of Johannesburg; on\r\nthe fourth day of his march the Boers had defeated him in battle, and\r\ncarried him and his men to Pretoria, the capital, as prisoners; the Boer\r\ngovernment had turned Jameson and his officers over to the British\r\ngovernment for trial, and shipped them to England; next, it had arrested\r\n64 important citizens of Johannesburg as raid-conspirators, condemned\r\ntheir four leaders to death, then commuted the sentences, and now the 64\r\nwere waiting, in jail, for further results.  Before midsummer they were\r\nall out excepting two, who refused to sign the petitions for release; 58\r\nhad been fined $10,000 each and enlarged, and the four leaders had gotten\r\noff with fines of $125,000 each with permanent exile added, in one case.\r\n\r\nThose were wonderfully interesting days for a stranger, and I was glad\r\nto be in the thick of the excitement.  Everybody was talking, and I\r\nexpected to understand the whole of one side of it in a very little\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed.  There were singularities, perplexities,\r\nunaccountabilities about it which I was not able to master.  I had no\r\npersonal access to Boers--their side was a secret to me, aside from what\r\nI was able to gather of it from published statements.  My sympathies were\r\nsoon with the Reformers in the Pretoria jail, with their friends, and\r\nwith their cause.  By diligent inquiry in Johannesburg I found out\r\n--apparently--all the details of their side of the quarrel except one--\r\nwhat\r\nthey expected to accomplish by an armed rising.\r\n\r\nNobody seemed to know.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Reformers were discontented and wanted some changes\r\nmade, seemed quite clear.  In Johannesburg it was claimed that the\r\nUitlanders (strangers, foreigners) paid thirteen-fifteenths of the\r\nTransvaal taxes, yet got little or nothing for it.  Their city had no\r\ncharter; it had no municipal government; it could levy no taxes for\r\ndrainage, water-supply, paving, cleaning, sanitation, policing.  There\r\nwas a police force, but it was composed of Boers, it was furnished by the\r\nState Government, and the city had no control over it.  Mining was very\r\ncostly; the government enormously increased the cost by putting\r\nburdensome taxes upon the mines, the output, the machinery, the\r\nbuildings; by burdensome imposts upon incoming materials; by burdensome\r\nrailway-freight-charges.  Hardest of all to bear, the government reserved\r\nto itself a monopoly in that essential thing, dynamite, and burdened it\r\nwith an extravagant price.  The detested Hollander from over the water\r\nheld all the public offices.  The government was rank with corruption.\r\nThe Uitlander had no vote, and must live in the State ten or twelve years\r\nbefore he could get one.  He was not represented in the Raad\r\n(legislature) that oppressed him and fleeced him.  Religion was not free.\r\nThere were no schools where the teaching was in English, yet the great\r\nmajority of the white population of the State knew no tongue but that.\r\nThe State would not pass a liquor law; but allowed a great trade in cheap\r\nvile brandy among the blacks, with the result that 25 per cent. of the\r\n50,000 blacks employed in the mines were usually drunk and incapable of\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nThere--it was plain enough that the reasons for wanting some changes made\r\nwere abundant and reasonable, if this statement of the existing\r\ngrievances was correct.\r\n\r\nWhat the Uitlanders wanted was reform--under the existing Republic.\r\n\r\nWhat they proposed to do was to secure these reforms by, prayer,\r\npetition, and persuasion.\r\n\r\nThey did petition.  Also, they issued a Manifesto, whose very first note\r\nis a bugle-blast of loyalty: \xe2\x80\x9cWe want the establishment of this Republic\r\nas a true Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCould anything be clearer than the Uitlander's statement of the\r\ngrievances and oppressions under which they were suffering?  Could\r\nanything be more legal and citizen-like and law-respecting than their\r\nattitude as expressed by their Manifesto?  No.  Those things were\r\nperfectly clear, perfectly comprehensible.\r\n\r\nBut at this point the puzzles and riddles and confusions begin to flock\r\nin.  You have arrived at a place which you cannot quite understand.\r\n\r\nFor you find that as a preparation for this loyal, lawful, and in every\r\nway unexceptionable attempt to persuade the government to right their\r\ngrievances, the Uitlanders had smuggled a Maxim gun or two and 1,500\r\nmuskets into the town, concealed in oil tanks and coal cars, and had\r\nbegun to form and drill military companies composed of clerks, merchants,\r\nand citizens generally.\r\n\r\nWhat was their idea?  Did they suppose that the Boers would attack them\r\nfor petitioning, for redress?  That could not be.\r\n\r\nDid they suppose that the Boers would attack them even for issuing a\r\nManifesto demanding relief under the existing government?\r\n\r\nYes, they apparently believed so, because the air was full of talk of\r\nforcing the government to grant redress if it were not granted\r\npeacefully.\r\n\r\nThe Reformers were men of high intelligence.  If they were in earnest,\r\nthey were taking extraordinary risks.  They had enormously valuable\r\nproperties to defend; their town was full of women and children; their\r\nmines and compounds were packed with thousands upon thousands of sturdy\r\nblacks.  If the Boers attacked, the mines would close, the blacks would\r\nswarm out and get drunk; riot and conflagration and the Boers together\r\nmight lose the Reformers more in a day, in money, blood, and suffering,\r\nthan the desired political relief could compensate in ten years if they\r\nwon the fight and secured the reforms.\r\n\r\nIt is May, 1897, now; a year has gone by, and the confusions of that day\r\nhave been to a considerable degree cleared away.  Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Dr.\r\nJameson, and others responsible for the Raid, have testified before the\r\nParliamentary Committee of Inquiry in London, and so have Mr. Lionel\r\nPhillips and other Johannesburg Reformers, monthly-nurses of the\r\nRevolution which was born dead.  These testimonies have thrown light.\r\nThree books have added much to this light:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSouth Africa As It Is,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mr. Statham, an able writer partial to the\r\nBoers; \xe2\x80\x9cThe Story of an African Crisis,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mr. Garrett, a brilliant\r\nwriter partial to Rhodes; and \xe2\x80\x9cA Woman's Part in a Revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d by Mrs.\r\nJohn Hays Hammond, a vigorous and vivid diarist, partial to the\r\nReformers.  By liquifying the evidence of the prejudiced books and of the\r\nprejudiced parliamentary witnesses and stirring the whole together and\r\npouring it into my own (prejudiced) moulds, I have got at the truth of\r\nthat puzzling South African situation, which is this:\r\n\r\n1.  The capitalists and other chief men of Johannesburg were fretting\r\nunder various political and financial burdens imposed by the State (the\r\nSouth African Republic, sometimes called \xe2\x80\x9cthe Transvaal\xe2\x80\x9d) and desired to\r\nprocure by peaceful means a modification of the laws.\r\n\r\n2.  Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Premier of the British Cape Colony, millionaire,\r\ncreator and managing director of the territorially-immense and\r\nfinancially unproductive South Africa Company; projector of vast schemes\r\nfor the unification and consolidation of all the South African States\r\ninto one imposing commonwealth or empire under the shadow and general\r\nprotection of the British flag, thought he saw an opportunity to make\r\nprofitable use of the Uitlander discontent above mentioned--make the\r\nJohannesburg cat help pull out one of his consolidation chestnuts for\r\nhim.  With this view he set himself the task of warming the lawful and\r\nlegitimate petitions and supplications of the Uitlanders into seditious\r\ntalk, and their frettings into threatenings--the final outcome to be\r\nrevolt and armed rebellion.  If he could bring about a bloody collision\r\nbetween those people and the Boer government, Great Britain would have to\r\ninterfere; her interference would be resisted by the Boers; she would\r\nchastise them and add the Transvaal to her South African possessions.  It\r\nwas not a foolish idea, but a rational and practical one.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years of judicious plotting, Mr. Rhodes had his reward;\r\nthe revolutionary kettle was briskly boiling in Johannesburg, and the\r\nUitlander leaders were backing their appeals to the government--now\r\nhardened into demands--by threats of force and bloodshed.  By the middle\r\nof December, 1895, the explosion seemed imminent.  Mr. Rhodes was\r\ndiligently helping, from his distant post in Cape Town.  He was helping\r\nto procure arms for Johannesburg; he was also arranging to have Jameson\r\nbreak over the border and come to Johannesburg with 600 mounted men at\r\nhis back.  Jameson--as per instructions from Rhodes, perhaps--wanted a\r\nletter from the Reformers requesting him to come to their aid.  It was a\r\ngood idea.  It would throw a considerable share of the responsibility of\r\nhis invasion upon the Reformers.  He got the letter--that famous one\r\nurging him to fly to the rescue of the women and children.  He got it two\r\nmonths before he flew.  The Reformers seem to have thought it over and\r\nconcluded that they had not done wisely; for the next day after giving\r\nJameson the implicating document they wanted to withdraw it and leave the\r\nwomen and children in danger; but they were told that it was too late.\r\nThe original had gone to Mr. Rhodes at the Cape.  Jameson had kept a\r\ncopy, though.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until the 29th of December, a good deal of the Reformers'\r\ntime was taken up with energetic efforts to keep Jameson from coming to\r\ntheir assistance.  Jameson's invasion had been set for the 26th.  The\r\nReformers were not ready.  The town was not united.  Some wanted a fight,\r\nsome wanted peace; some wanted a new government, some wanted the existing\r\none reformed; apparently very few wanted the revolution to take place in\r\nthe interest and under the ultimate shelter of the Imperial flag\r\n--British; yet a report began to spread that Mr. Rhodes's embarrassing\r\nassistance had for its end this latter object.\r\n\r\nJameson was away up on the frontier tugging at his leash, fretting to\r\nburst over the border.  By hard work the Reformers got his starting-date\r\npostponed a little, and wanted to get it postponed eleven days.\r\nApparently, Rhodes's agents were seconding their efforts--in fact wearing\r\nout the telegraph wires trying to hold him back.  Rhodes was himself the\r\nonly man who could have effectively postponed Jameson, but that would\r\nhave been a disadvantage to his scheme; indeed, it could spoil his whole\r\ntwo years' work.\r\n\r\nJameson endured postponement three days, then resolved to wait no longer.\r\nWithout any orders--excepting Mr. Rhodes's significant silence--he cut\r\nthe telegraph wires on the 29th, and made his plunge that night, to go to\r\nthe rescue of the women and children, by urgent request of a letter now\r\nnine days old--as per date,--a couple of months old, in fact.  He read\r\nthe letter to his men, and it affected them.  It did not affect all of\r\nthem alike.  Some saw in it a piece of piracy of doubtful wisdom, and\r\nwere sorry to find that they had been assembled to violate friendly\r\nterritory instead of to raid native kraals, as they had supposed.\r\n\r\nJameson would have to ride 150 miles.  He knew that there were suspicions\r\nabroad in the Transvaal concerning him, but he expected to get through to\r\nJohannesburg before they should become general and obstructive. But a\r\ntelegraph wire had been overlooked and not cut.  It spread the news of\r\nhis invasion far and wide, and a few hours after his start the Boer\r\nfarmers were riding hard from every direction to intercept him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was known in Johannesburg that he was on his way to rescue\r\nthe women and children, the grateful people put the women and children in\r\na train and rushed them for Australia.  In fact, the approach of\r\nJohannesburg's saviour created panic and consternation there, and a\r\nmultitude of males of peaceable disposition swept to the trains like a\r\nsand-storm.  The early ones fared best; they secured seats--by sitting in\r\nthem--eight hours before the first train was timed to leave.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes lost no time.  He cabled the renowned Johannesburg letter of\r\ninvitation to the London press--the gray-headedest piece of ancient\r\nhistory that ever went over a cable.\r\n\r\nThe new poet laureate lost no time.  He came out with a rousing poem\r\nlauding Jameson's prompt and splendid heroism in flying to the rescue of\r\nthe women and children; for the poet could not know that he did not fly\r\nuntil two months after the invitation.  He was deceived by the false date\r\nof the letter, which was December 20th.\r\n\r\nJameson was intercepted by the Boers on New Year's Day, and on the next\r\nday he surrendered.  He had carried his copy of the letter along, and if\r\nhis instructions required him--in case of emergency--to see that it fell\r\ninto the hands of the Boers, he loyally carried them out.  Mrs. Hammond\r\ngives him a sharp rap for his supposed carelessness, and emphasizes her\r\nfeeling about it with burning italics: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was picked up on the\r\nbattle-field in a leathern pouch, supposed to be Dr. Jameson's saddle-\r\nbag. Why, in the name of all that is discreet and honorable, didn't he\r\neat it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe requires too much.  He was not in the service of the Reformers\r\n--excepting ostensibly; he was in the service of Mr. Rhodes.  It was the\r\nonly plain English document, undarkened by ciphers and mysteries, and\r\nresponsibly signed and authenticated, which squarely implicated the\r\nReformers in the raid, and it was not to Mr. Rhodes's interest that it\r\nshould be eaten.  Besides, that letter was not the original, it was only\r\na copy.  Mr. Rhodes had the original--and didn't eat it.  He cabled it to\r\nthe London press.  It had already been read in England and America and\r\nall over Europe before Jameson dropped it on the battlefield.  If the\r\nsubordinate's knuckles deserved a rap, the principal's deserved as many\r\nas a couple of them.\r\n\r\nThat letter is a juicily dramatic incident and is entitled to all its\r\ncelebrity, because of the odd and variegated effects which it produced.\r\nAll within the space of a single week it had made Jameson an illustrious\r\nhero in England, a pirate in Pretoria, and an ass without discretion or\r\nhonor in Johannesburg; also it had produced a poet-laureatic explosion of\r\ncolored fireworks which filled the world's sky with giddy splendors, and,\r\nthe knowledge that Jameson was coming with it to rescue the women and\r\nchildren emptied Johannesburg of that detail of the population.  For an\r\nold letter, this was much.  For a letter two months old, it did marvels;\r\nif it had been a year old it would have done miracles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nFirst catch your Boer, then kick him.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThose latter days were days of bitter worry and trouble for the harassed\r\nReformers.\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Hammond we learn that on the 31st (the day after Johannesburg\r\nheard of the invasion), \xe2\x80\x9cThe Reform Committee repudiates Dr. Jameson's\r\ninroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt also publishes its intention to adhere to the Manifesto.\r\n\r\nIt also earnestly desires that the inhabitants shall refrain from overt\r\nacts against the Boer government.\r\n\r\nIt also \xe2\x80\x9cdistributes arms\xe2\x80\x9d at the Court House, and furnishes horses \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nthe newly-enrolled volunteers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt also brings a Transvaal flag into the committee-room, and the entire\r\nbody swear allegiance to it \xe2\x80\x9cwith uncovered heads and upraised arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlso \xe2\x80\x9cone thousand Lee-Metford rifles have been given out\xe2\x80\x9d--to rebels.\r\n\r\nAlso, in a speech, Reformer Lionel Phillips informs the public that the\r\nReform Committee Delegation has \xe2\x80\x9cbeen received with courtesy by the\r\nGovernment Commission,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbeen assured that their proposals shall be\r\nearnestly considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  That \xe2\x80\x9cwhile the Reform Committee regretted\r\nJameson's precipitate action, they would stand by him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlso the populace are in a state of \xe2\x80\x9cwild enthusiasm,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccan\r\nscarcely be restrained; they want to go out to meet Jameson and bring him\r\nin with triumphal outcry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlso the British High Commissioner has issued a damnifying proclamation\r\nagainst Jameson and all British abettors of his game.  It arrives January\r\n1st.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult position for the Reformers, and full of hindrances and\r\nperplexities.  Their duty is hard, but plain:\r\n\r\n1.  They have to repudiate the inroad, and stand by the inroader.\r\n\r\n2.  They have to swear allegiance to the Boer government, and distribute\r\ncavalry horses to the rebels.\r\n\r\n3.  They have to forbid overt acts against the Boer government, and\r\ndistribute arms to its enemies.\r\n\r\n4.  They have to avoid collision with the British government, but still\r\nstand by Jameson and their new oath of allegiance to the Boer government,\r\ntaken, uncovered, in presence of its flag.\r\n\r\nThey did such of these things as they could; they tried to do them all;\r\nin fact, did do them all, but only in turn, not simultaneously.  In the\r\nnature of things they could not be made to simultane.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for armed revolution and in talking revolution, were the\r\nReformers \xe2\x80\x9cbluffing,\xe2\x80\x9d or were they in earnest?  If they were in earnest,\r\nthey were taking great risks--as has been already pointed out.  A\r\ngentleman of high position told me in Johannesburg that he had in his\r\npossession a printed document proclaiming a new government and naming its\r\npresident--one of the Reform leaders.  He said that this proclamation had\r\nbeen ready for issue, but was suppressed when the raid collapsed.\r\nPerhaps I misunderstood him.  Indeed, I must have misunderstood him, for\r\nI have not seen mention of this large incident in print anywhere.\r\n\r\nBesides, I hope I am mistaken; for, if I am, then there is argument that\r\nthe Reformers were privately not serious, but were only trying to scare\r\nthe Boer government into granting the desired reforms.\r\n\r\nThe Boer government was scared, and it had a right to be.  For if Mr.\r\nRhodes's plan was to provoke a collision that would compel the\r\ninterference of England, that was a serious matter.  If it could be shown\r\nthat that was also the Reformers' plan and purpose, it would prove that\r\nthey had marked out a feasible project, at any rate, although it was one\r\nwhich could hardly fail to cost them ruinously before England should\r\narrive.  But it seems clear that they had no such plan nor desire.  If,\r\nwhen the worst should come to the worst, they meant to overthrow the\r\ngovernment, they also meant to inherit the assets themselves, no doubt.\r\n\r\nThis scheme could hardly have succeeded.  With an army of Boers at their\r\ngates and 50,000 riotous blacks in their midst, the odds against success\r\nwould have been too heavy--even if the whole town had been armed.  With\r\nonly 2,500 rifles in the place, they stood really no chance.\r\n\r\nTo me, the military problems of the situation are of more interest than\r\nthe political ones, because by disposition I have always been especially\r\nfond of war.  No, I mean fond of discussing war; and fond of giving\r\nmilitary advice.  If I had been with Jameson the morning after he\r\nstarted, I should have advised him to turn back.  That was Monday; it was\r\nthen that he received his first warning from a Boer source not to violate\r\nthe friendly soil of the Transvaal.  It showed that his invasion was\r\nknown.  If I had been with him on Tuesday morning and afternoon, when he\r\nreceived further warnings, I should have repeated my advice.  If I had\r\nbeen with him the next morning--New Year's--when he received notice that\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca few hundred\xe2\x80\x9d Boers were waiting for him a few miles ahead, I should\r\nnot have advised, but commanded him to go back.  And if I had been with\r\nhim two or three hours later--a thing not conceivable to me--I should\r\nhave retired him by force; for at that time he learned that the few\r\nhundred had now grown to 800; and that meant that the growing would go on\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nFor, by authority of Mr. Garrett, one knows that Jameson's 600 were only\r\n530 at most, when you count out his native drivers, etc.; and that the\r\n530 consisted largely of \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d youths, \xe2\x80\x9craw young fellows,\xe2\x80\x9d not trained\r\nand war-worn British soldiers; and I would have told Jameson that those\r\nlads would not be able to shoot effectively from horseback in the scamper\r\nand racket of battle, and that there would not be anything for them to\r\nshoot at, anyway, but rocks; for the Boers would be behind the rocks, not\r\nout in the open.  I would have told him that 300 Boer sharpshooters\r\nbehind rocks would be an overmatch for his 500 raw young fellows on\r\nhorseback.\r\n\r\nIf pluck were the only thing essential to battle-winning, the English\r\nwould lose no battles.  But discretion, as well as pluck, is required\r\nwhen one fights Boers and Red Indians.  In South Africa the Briton has\r\nalways insisted upon standing bravely up, unsheltered, before the hidden\r\nBoer, and taking the results: Jameson's men would follow the custom.\r\nJameson would not have listened to me--he would have been intent upon\r\nrepeating history, according to precedent.  Americans are not acquainted\r\nwith the British-Boer war of 1881; but its history is interesting, and\r\ncould have been instructive to Jameson if he had been receptive.  I will\r\ncull some details of it from trustworthy sources mainly from \xe2\x80\x9cRussell's\r\nNatal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mr. Russell is not a Boer, but a Briton.  He is inspector of\r\nschools, and his history is a text-book whose purpose is the instruction\r\nof the Natal English youth.\r\n\r\nAfter the seizure of the Transvaal and the suppression of the Boer\r\ngovernment by England in 1877, the Boers fretted for three years, and\r\nmade several appeals to England for a restoration of their liberties,\r\nbut without result.  Then they gathered themselves together in a great\r\nmass-meeting at Krugersdorp, talked their troubles over, and resolved to\r\nfight for their deliverance from the British yoke.  (Krugersdorp--the\r\nplace where the Boers interrupted the Jameson raid.)  The little handful\r\nof farmers rose against the strongest empire in the world.  They\r\nproclaimed martial law and the re-establishment of their Republic.  They\r\norganized their forces and sent them forward to intercept the British\r\nbattalions. This, although Sir Garnet Wolseley had but lately made\r\nproclamation that \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the sun shone in the heavens,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nTransvaal would be and remain English territory.  And also in spite of\r\nthe fact that the commander of the 94th regiment--already on the march to\r\nsuppress this rebellion--had been heard to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Boers would turn\r\ntail at the first beat of the big drum.\xe2\x80\x9d--[\xe2\x80\x9cSouth Africa As It Is,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n by F. Reginald Statham, page 82.  London: T.  Fisher Unwin, 1897.]\r\n\r\nFour days after the flag-raising, the Boer force which had been sent\r\nforward to forbid the invasion of the English troops met them at\r\nBronkhorst Spruit--246 men of the 94th regiment, in command of a colonel,\r\nthe big drum beating, the band playing--and the first battle was fought.\r\nIt lasted ten minutes.  Result:\r\n\r\n     British loss, more than 150 officers and men, out of the 246.\r\n     Surrender of the remnant.\r\n\r\n     Boer loss--if any--not stated.\r\n\r\nThey are fine marksmen, the Boers.  From the cradle up, they live on\r\nhorseback and hunt wild animals with the rifle.  They have a passion for\r\nliberty and the Bible, and care for nothing else.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Sir George Colley, Lieutenant-Governor and Commander-in-Chief in\r\nNatal, felt it his duty to proceed at once to the relief of the loyalists\r\nand soldiers beleaguered in the different towns of the Transvaal.\xe2\x80\x9d  He\r\nmoved out with 1,000 men and some artillery.  He found the Boers encamped\r\nin a strong and sheltered position on high ground at Laing's Nek--every\r\nBoer behind a rock.  Early in the morning of the 28th January, 1881, he\r\nmoved to the attack \xe2\x80\x9cwith the 58th regiment, commanded by Colonel Deane,\r\na mounted squadron of 70 men, the 60th Rifles, the Naval Brigade with\r\nthree rocket tubes, and the Artillery with six guns.\xe2\x80\x9d  He shelled the\r\nBoers for twenty minutes, then the assault was delivered, the 58th\r\nmarching up the slope in solid column.  The battle was soon finished,\r\nwith this result, according to Russell--\r\n\r\n     British loss in killed and wounded, 174.\r\n\r\n     Boer loss, \xe2\x80\x9ctrifling.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nColonel Deane was killed, and apparently every officer above the grade of\r\nlieutenant was killed or wounded, for the 58th retreated to its camp in\r\ncommand of a lieutenant.  (\xe2\x80\x9cAfrica as It Is.\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\nThat ended the second battle.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of February General Colley discovered that the Boers were\r\nflanking his position.  The next morning he left his camp at Mount\r\nPleasant and marched out and crossed the Ingogo river with 270 men,\r\nstarted up the Ingogo heights, and there fought a battle which lasted\r\nfrom noon till nightfall.  He then retreated, leaving his wounded with\r\nhis military chaplain, and in recrossing the now swollen river lost some\r\nof his men by drowning.  That was the third Boer victory.  Result,\r\naccording to Mr. Russell--\r\n\r\n     British loss 150 out of 270 engaged.\r\n\r\n     Boer loss, 8 killed, 9 wounded--17.\r\n\r\nThere was a season of quiet, now, but at the end of about three weeks Sir\r\nGeorge Colley conceived the idea of climbing, with an infantry and\r\nartillery force, the steep and rugged mountain of Amajuba in the night--a\r\nbitter hard task, but he accomplished it.  On the way he left about 200\r\nmen to guard a strategic point, and took about 400 up the mountain with\r\nhim.  When the sun rose in the morning, there was an unpleasant surprise\r\nfor the Boers; yonder were the English troops visible on top of the\r\nmountain two or three miles away, and now their own position was at the\r\nmercy of the English artillery.  The Boer chief resolved to retreat--up\r\nthat mountain.  He asked for volunteers, and got them.\r\n\r\nThe storming party crossed the swale and began to creep up the steeps,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand from behind rocks and bushes they shot at the soldiers on the\r\nskyline as if they were stalking deer,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Russell.  There was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous musketry fire, steady and fatal on the one side, wild and\r\nineffectual on the other.\xe2\x80\x9d The Boers reached the top, and began to put in\r\ntheir ruinous work.  Presently the British \xe2\x80\x9cbroke and fled for their\r\nlives down the rugged steep.\xe2\x80\x9d The Boers had won the battle.  Result in\r\nkilled and wounded, including among the killed the British General:\r\n\r\n     British loss, 226, out of 400 engaged.\r\n\r\n     Boer loss, 1 killed, 5 wounded.\r\n\r\nThat ended the war.  England listened to reason, and recognized the Boer\r\nRepublic--a government which has never been in any really awful danger\r\nsince, until Jameson started after it with his 500 \xe2\x80\x9craw young fellows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n To recapitulate:\r\n\r\nThe Boer farmers and British soldiers fought 4 battles, and the Boers won\r\nthem all.  Result of the 4, in killed and wounded:\r\n\r\n     British loss, 700 men.\r\n\r\n     Boer loss, so far as known, 23 men.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, now, to note how loyally Jameson and his several\r\ntrained British military officers tried to make their battles conform to\r\nprecedent.  Mr. Garrett's account of the Raid is much the best one I have\r\nmet with, and my impressions of the Raid are drawn from that.\r\n\r\nWhen Jameson learned that near Krugersdorp he would find 800 Boers\r\nwaiting to dispute his passage, he was not in the least disturbed.  He\r\nwas feeling as he had felt two or three days before, when he had opened\r\nhis campaign with a historic remark to the same purport as the one with\r\nwhich the commander of the 94th had opened the Boer-British war of\r\nfourteen years before.  That Commander's remark was, that the Boers\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwould turn tail at the first beat of the big drum.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jameson's was, that\r\nwith his \xe2\x80\x9craw young fellows\xe2\x80\x9d he could kick the (persons) of the Boers\r\n\xe2\x80\x9call round the Transvaal.\xe2\x80\x9d  He was keeping close to historic precedent.\r\n\r\nJameson arrived in the presence of the Boers.  They--according to\r\nprecedent--were not visible.  It was a country of ridges, depressions,\r\nrocks, ditches, moraines of mining-tailings--not even as favorable for\r\ncavalry work as Laing's Nek had been in the former disastrous days.\r\nJameson shot at the ridges and rocks with his artillery, just as General\r\nColley had done at the Nek; and did them no damage and persuaded no Boer\r\nto show himself.  Then about a hundred of his men formed up to charge the\r\nridge-according to the 58th's precedent at the Nek; but as they dashed\r\nforward they opened out in a long line, which was a considerable\r\nimprovement on the 58th's tactics; when they had gotten to within 200\r\nyards of the ridge the concealed Boers opened out on them and emptied 20\r\nsaddles.  The unwounded dismounted and fired at the rocks over the backs\r\nof their horses; but the return-fire was too hot, and they mounted again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand galloped back or crawled away into a clump of reeds for cover, where\r\nthey were shortly afterward taken prisoners as they lay among the reeds.\r\nSome thirty prisoners were so taken, and during the night which followed\r\nthe Boers carried away another thirty killed and wounded--the wounded to\r\nKrugersdorp hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sixty per cent. of the assaulted force disposed\r\nof--according to Mr. Garrett's estimate.\r\n\r\nIt was according to Amajuba precedent, where the British loss was 226 out\r\nof about 400 engaged.\r\n\r\nAlso, in Jameson's camp, that night, \xe2\x80\x9cthere lay about 30 wounded or\r\notherwise disabled\xe2\x80\x9d men.  Also during the night \xe2\x80\x9csome 30 or 40 young\r\nfellows got separated from the command and straggled through into\r\nJohannesburg.\xe2\x80\x9d  Altogether a possible 150 men gone, out of his 530.  His\r\nlads had fought valorously, but had not been able to get near enough to a\r\nBoer to kick him around the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nAt dawn the next morning the column of something short of 400 whites\r\nresumed its march.  Jameson's grit was stubbornly good; indeed, it was\r\nalways that.  He still had hopes.  There was a long and tedious\r\nzigzagging march through broken ground, with constant harassment from the\r\nBoers; and at last the column \xe2\x80\x9cwalked into a sort of trap,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Boers\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cclosed in upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cMen and horses dropped on all sides.  In the\r\ncolumn the feeling grew that unless it could burst through the Boer lines\r\nat this point it was done for.  The Maxims were fired until they grew too\r\nhot, and, water failing for the cool jacket, five of them jammed and went\r\nout of action.  The 7-pounder was fired until only half an hour's\r\nammunition was left to fire with.  One last rush was made, and failed,\r\nand then the Staats Artillery came up on the left flank, and the game was\r\nup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJameson hoisted a white flag and surrendered.\r\n\r\nThere is a story, which may not be true, about an ignorant Boer farmer\r\nthere who thought that this white flag was the national flag of England.\r\nHe had been at Bronkhorst, and Laing's Nek, and Ingogo and Amajuba, and\r\nsupposed that the English did not run up their flag excepting at the end\r\nof a fight.\r\n\r\nThe following is (as I understand it) Mr. Garrett's estimate of Jameson's\r\ntotal loss in killed and wounded for the two days:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they gave in they were minus some 20 per cent. of combatants.\r\nThere were 76 casualties.  There were 30 men hurt or sick in the wagons.\r\nThere were 27 killed on the spot or mortally wounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTotal, 133, out of the original 530.  It is just 25 per cent.--[However,\r\nI judge that the total was really 150; for the number of wounded carried\r\nto Krugersdorp hospital was 53; not 30, as Mr. Garrett reports it.  The\r\nlady whose guest I was in Krugersdorp gave me the figures.  She was head\r\nnurse from the beginning of hostilities (Jan. 1) until the professional\r\nnurses arrived, Jan. 8th.  Of the 53, \xe2\x80\x9cThree or four were Boers\xe2\x80\x9d; I quote\r\nher words.]--This is a large improvement upon the precedents established\r\nat Bronkhorst, Laing's Nek, Ingogo, and Amajuba, and seems to indicate\r\nthat Boer marksmanship is not so good now as it was in those days.  But\r\nthere is one detail in which the Raid-episode exactly repeats history.\r\nBy surrender at Bronkhorst, the whole British force disappeared from the\r\ntheater of war; this was the case with Jameson's force.\r\n\r\nIn the Boer loss, also, historical precedent is followed with sufficient\r\nfidelity.  In the 4 battles named above, the Boer loss, so far as known,\r\nwas an average of 6 men per battle, to the British average loss of 175.\r\nIn Jameson's battles, as per Boer official report, the Boer loss in\r\nkilled was 4.  Two of these were killed by the Boers themselves, by\r\naccident, the other by Jameson's army--one of them intentionally, the\r\nother by a pathetic mischance.  \xe2\x80\x9cA young Boer named Jacobz was moving\r\nforward to give a drink to one of the wounded troopers (Jameson's) after\r\nthe first charge, when another wounded man, mistaking his intention; shot\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d  There were three or four wounded Boers in the Krugersdorp\r\nhospital, and apparently no others have been reported.  Mr. Garrett, \xe2\x80\x9con\r\na balance of probabilities, fully accepts the official version, and\r\nthanks Heaven the killed was not larger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs a military man, I wish to point out what seems to me to be military\r\nerrors in the conduct of the campaign which we have just been\r\nconsidering.  I have seen active service in the field, and it was in the\r\nactualities of war that I acquired my training and my right to speak.\r\nI served two weeks in the beginning of our Civil War, and during all that\r\ntime commanded a battery of infantry composed of twelve men.  General\r\nGrant knew the history of my campaign, for I told it him.  I also told\r\nhim the principle upon which I had conducted it; which was, to tire the\r\nenemy.  I tired out and disqualified many battalions, yet never had a\r\ncasualty myself nor lost a man.  General Grant was not given to paying\r\ncompliments, yet he said frankly that if I had conducted the whole war\r\nmuch bloodshed would have been spared, and that what the army might have\r\nlost through the inspiriting results of collision in the field would have\r\nbeen amply made up by the liberalizing influences of travel.  Further\r\nendorsement does not seem to me to be necessary.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine history, and see what it teaches.  In the 4 battles\r\nfought in 1881 and the two fought by Jameson, the British loss in killed,\r\nwounded, and prisoners, was substantially 1,300 men; the Boer loss, as\r\nfar as is ascertainable, was about 30 men.  These figures show that\r\nthere was a defect somewhere.  It was not in the absence of courage.  I\r\nthink it lay in the absence of discretion.  The Briton should have done\r\none thing or the other: discarded British methods and fought the Boer\r\nwith Boer methods, or augmented his own force until--using British\r\nmethods--it should be large enough to equalize results with the Boer.\r\n\r\nTo retain the British method requires certain things, determinable by\r\narithmetic.  If, for argument's sake, we allow that the aggregate of\r\n1,716 British soldiers engaged in the 4 early battles was opposed by the\r\nsame aggregate of Boers, we have this result: the British loss of 700 and\r\nthe Boer loss of 23 argues that in order to equalize results in future\r\nbattles you must make the British force thirty times as strong as the\r\nBoer force.  Mr. Garrett shows that the Boer force immediately opposed to\r\nJameson was 2,000, and that there were 6,000 more on hand by the evening\r\nof the second day.  Arithmetic shows that in order to make himself the\r\nequal of the 8,000 Boers, Jameson should have had 240,000 men, whereas he\r\nmerely had 530 boys.  From a military point of view, backed by the facts\r\nof history, I conceive that Jameson's military judgment was at fault.\r\n\r\nAnother thing.--Jameson was encumbered by artillery, ammunition, and\r\nrifles.  The facts of the battle show that he should have had none of\r\nthose things along.  They were heavy, they were in his way, they impeded\r\nhis march.  There was nothing to shoot at but rocks--he knew quite well\r\nthat there would be nothing to shoot at but rocks--and he knew that\r\nartillery and rifles have no effect upon rocks.  He was badly overloaded\r\nwith unessentials.  He had 8 Maxims--a Maxim is a kind of Gatling, I\r\nbelieve, and shoots about 500 bullets per minute; he had one\r\n12 1/2-pounder cannon and two 7-pounders; also, 145,000 rounds of\r\nammunition. He worked the Maxims so hard upon the rocks that five of them\r\nbecame disabled--five of the Maxims, not the rocks.  It is believed that\r\nupwards of 100,000 rounds of ammunition of the various kinds were fired\r\nduring the 21 hours that the battles lasted.  One man killed.  He must\r\nhave been much mutilated.  It was a pity to bring those futile Maxims\r\nalong. Jameson should have furnished himself with a battery of Pudd'nhead\r\nWilson maxims instead. They are much more deadly than those others, and\r\nthey are easily carried, because they have no weight.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrett--not very carefully concealing a smile--excuses the presence\r\nof the Maxims by saying that they were of very substantial use because\r\ntheir sputtering disordered the aim of the Boers, and in that way saved\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThree cannon, eight Maxims, and five hundred rifles yielded a result\r\nwhich emphasized a fact which had already been established--that the\r\nBritish system of standing out in the open to fight Boers who are behind\r\nrocks is not wise, not excusable, and ought to be abandoned for something\r\nmore efficacious.  For the purpose of war is to kill, not merely to waste\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nIf I could get the management of one of those campaigns, I would know\r\nwhat to do, for I have studied the Boer.  He values the Bible above every\r\nother thing.  The most delicious edible in South Africa is \xe2\x80\x9cbiltong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n You will have seen it mentioned in Olive Schreiner's books.  It is what\r\nour plainsmen call \xe2\x80\x9cjerked beef.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is the Boer's main standby.  He has\r\na passion for it, and he is right.\r\n\r\nIf I had the command of the campaign I would go with rifles only, no\r\ncumbersome Maxims and cannon to spoil good rocks with.  I would move\r\nsurreptitiously by night to a point about a quarter of a mile from the\r\nBoer camp, and there I would build up a pyramid of biltong and Bibles\r\nfifty feet high, and then conceal my men all about.  In the morning the\r\nBoers would send out spies, and then the rest would come with a rush.\r\nI would surround them, and they would have to fight my men on equal\r\nterms, in the open.  There wouldn't be any Amajuba results.\r\n\r\n--[Just as I am finishing this book an unfortunate dispute has sprung up\r\nbetween Dr. Jameson and his officers, on the one hand, and Colonel Rhodes\r\non the other, concerning the wording of a note which Colonel Rhodes sent\r\nfrom Johannesburg by a cyclist to Jameson just before hostilities began\r\non the memorable New Year's Day.  Some of the fragments of this note were\r\nfound on the battlefield after the fight, and these have been pieced\r\ntogether; the dispute is as to what words the lacking fragments\r\ncontained.  Jameson says the note promised him a reinforcement of 300 men\r\nfrom Johannesburg.  Colonel Rhodes denies this, and says he merely\r\npromised to send out \xe2\x80\x9csome\xe2\x80\x9d men \xe2\x80\x9cto meet you.\xe2\x80\x9d]\r\n\r\n[It seems a pity that these friends should fall out over so little a\r\nthing.  If the 300 had been sent, what good would it have done?  In 21\r\nhours of industrious fighting, Jameson's 530 men, with 8 Maxims, 3\r\ncannon, and 145,000 rounds of ammunition, killed an aggregate of 1\r\nBoer.  These statistics show that a reinforcement of 300 Johannesburgers,\r\narmed merely with muskets, would have killed, at the outside, only a\r\nlittle over a half of another Boer.  This would not have saved the day.\r\nIt would not even have seriously affected the general result.  The\r\nfigures show clearly, and with mathematical violence, that the only way\r\nto save Jameson, or even give him a fair and equal chance with the enemy,\r\nwas for Johannesburg to send him 240 Maxims, 90 cannon, 600 carloads of\r\nammunition, and 240,000 men.  Johannesburg was not in a position to do\r\nthis.  Johannesburg has been called very hard names for not reinforcing\r\nJameson.  But in every instance this has been done by two classes of\r\npersons--people who do not read history, and people, like Jameson, who do\r\nnot understand what it means, after they have read it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nNone of us can have as many virtues as the fountain-pen, or half its\r\ncussedness; but we can try.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Fife has borne testimony that Mr. Rhodes deceived him.  That\r\nis also what Mr. Rhodes did with the Reformers.  He got them into\r\ntrouble, and then stayed out himself.  A judicious man.  He has always\r\nbeen that.  As to this there was a moment of doubt, once.  It was when he\r\nwas out on his last pirating expedition in the Matabele country.  The\r\ncable shouted out that he had gone unarmed, to visit a party of hostile\r\nchiefs.  It was true, too; and this dare-devil thing came near fetching\r\nanother indiscretion out of the poet laureate.  It would have been too\r\nbad, for when the facts were all in, it turned out that there was a lady\r\nalong, too, and she also was unarmed.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of many people Mr. Rhodes is South Africa; others think he\r\nis only a large part of it.  These latter consider that South Africa\r\nconsists of Table Mountain, the diamond mines, the Johannesburg gold\r\nfields, and Cecil Rhodes.  The gold fields are wonderful in every way.\r\nIn seven or eight years they built up, in a desert, a city of a hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants, counting white and black together; and not the\r\nordinary mining city of wooden shanties, but a city made out of lasting\r\nmaterial.  Nowhere in the world is there such a concentration of rich\r\nmines as at Johannesburg.  Mr. Bonamici, my manager there, gave me a\r\nsmall gold brick with some statistics engraved upon it which record the\r\noutput of gold from the early days to July, 1895, and exhibit the strides\r\nwhich have been made in the development of the industry; in 1888 the\r\noutput was $4,162,440; the output of the next five and a half years was\r\n(total) $17,585,894; for the single year ending with June, 1895, it was\r\n$45,553,700.\r\n\r\nThe capital which has developed the mines came from England, the mining\r\nengineers from America.  This is the case with the diamond mines also.\r\nSouth Africa seems to be the heaven of the American scientific mining\r\nengineer.  He gets the choicest places, and keeps them.  His salary is\r\nnot based upon what he would get in America, but apparently upon what a\r\nwhole family of him would get there.\r\n\r\nThe successful mines pay great dividends, yet the rock is not rich, from\r\na Californian point of view.  Rock which yields ten or twelve dollars a\r\nton is considered plenty rich enough.  It is troubled with base metals to\r\nsuch a degree that twenty years ago it would have been only about half as\r\nvaluable as it is now; for at that time there was no paying way of\r\ngetting anything out of such rock but the coarser-grained \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d gold;\r\nbut\r\nthe new cyanide process has changed all that, and the gold fields of the\r\nworld now deliver up fifty million dollars' worth of gold per year which\r\nwould have gone into the tailing-pile under the former conditions.\r\n\r\nThe cyanide process was new to me, and full of interest; and among the\r\ncostly and elaborate mining machinery there were fine things which were\r\nnew to me, but I was already familiar with the rest of the details of the\r\ngold-mining industry.  I had been a gold miner myself, in my day, and\r\nknew substantially everything that those people knew about it, except how\r\nto make money at it.  But I learned a good deal about the Boers there,\r\nand that was a fresh subject.  What I heard there was afterwards repeated\r\nto me in other parts of South Africa.  Summed up--according to the\r\ninformation thus gained--this is the Boer:\r\n\r\nHe is deeply religious, profoundly ignorant, dull, obstinate, bigoted,\r\nuncleanly in his habits, hospitable, honest in his dealings with the\r\nwhites, a hard master to his black servant, lazy, a good shot, good\r\nhorseman, addicted to the chase, a lover of political independence, a\r\ngood husband and father, not fond of herding together in towns, but\r\nliking the seclusion and remoteness and solitude and empty vastness and\r\nsilence of the veldt; a man of a mighty appetite, and not delicate about\r\nwhat he appeases it with--well-satisfied with pork and Indian corn and\r\nbiltong, requiring only that the quantity shall not be stinted; willing\r\nto ride a long journey to take a hand in a rude all-night dance\r\ninterspersed with vigorous feeding and boisterous jollity, but ready to\r\nride twice as far for a prayer-meeting; proud of his Dutch and Huguenot\r\norigin and its religious and military history; proud of his race's\r\nachievements in South Africa, its bold plunges into hostile and uncharted\r\ndeserts in search of free solitudes unvexed by the pestering and detested\r\nEnglish, also its victories over the natives and the British; proudest of\r\nall, of the direct and effusive personal interest which the Deity has\r\nalways taken in its affairs.  He cannot read, he cannot write; he has one\r\nor two newspapers, but he is, apparently, not aware of it; until latterly\r\nhe had no schools, and taught his children nothing, news is a term which\r\nhas no meaning to him, and the thing itself he cares nothing about.  He\r\nhates to be taxed and resents it.  He has stood stock still in South\r\nAfrica for two centuries and a half, and would like to stand still till\r\nthe end of time, for he has no sympathy with Uitlander notions of\r\nprogress.  He is hungry to be rich, for he is human; but his preference\r\nhas been for riches in cattle, not in fine clothes and fine houses and\r\ngold and diamonds.  The gold and the diamonds have brought the godless\r\nstranger within his gates, also contamination and broken repose, and he\r\nwishes that they had never been discovered.\r\n\r\nI think that the bulk of those details can be found in Olive Schreiner's\r\nbooks, and she would not be accused of sketching the Boer's portrait with\r\nan unfair hand.\r\n\r\nNow what would you expect from that unpromising material?  What ought you\r\nto expect from it?  Laws inimical to religious liberty? Yes.  Laws\r\ndenying, representation and suffrage to the intruder? Yes.  Laws\r\nunfriendly to educational institutions? Yes.  Laws obstructive of gold\r\nproduction? Yes.  Discouragement of railway expansion? Yes.  Laws heavily\r\ntaxing the intruder and overlooking the Boer? Yes.\r\n\r\nThe Uitlander seems to have expected something very different from all\r\nthat.  I do not know why.  Nothing different from it was rationally to be\r\nexpected.  A round man cannot be expected to fit a square hole right\r\naway.  He must have time to modify his shape.  The modification had begun\r\nin a detail or two, before the Raid, and was making some progress.  It\r\nhas made further progress since.  There are wise men in the Boer\r\ngovernment, and that accounts for the modification; the modification of\r\nthe Boer mass has probably not begun yet.  If the heads of the Boer\r\ngovernment had not been wise men they would have hanged Jameson, and thus\r\nturned a very commonplace pirate into a holy martyr.  But even their\r\nwisdom has its limits, and they will hang Mr. Rhodes if they ever catch\r\nhim.  That will round him and complete him and make him a saint.  He has\r\nalready been called by all other titles that symbolize human grandeur,\r\nand he ought to rise to this one, the grandest of all.  It will be a\r\ndizzy jump from where he is now, but that is nothing, it will land him in\r\ngood company and be a pleasant change for him.\r\n\r\nSome of the things demanded by the Johannesburgers' Manifesto have been\r\nconceded since the days of the Raid, and the others will follow in time,\r\nno doubt.  It was most fortunate for the miners of Johannesburg that the\r\ntaxes which distressed them so much were levied by the Boer government,\r\ninstead of by their friend Rhodes and his Chartered Company of\r\nhighwaymen, for these latter take half of whatever their mining victims\r\nfind, they do not stop at a mere percentage.  If the Johannesburg miners\r\nwere under their jurisdiction they would be in the poorhouse in twelve\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nI have been under the impression all along that I had an unpleasant\r\nparagraph about the Boers somewhere in my notebook, and also a pleasant\r\none.  I have found them now.  The unpleasant one is dated at an interior\r\nvillage, and says--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Z. called.  He is an English Afrikander; is an old resident, and has\r\na Boer wife.  He speaks the language, and his professional business is\r\nwith the Boers exclusively.  He told me that the ancient Boer families in\r\nthe great region of which this village is the commercial center are\r\nfalling victims to their inherited indolence and dullness in the\r\nmaterialistic latter-day race and struggle, and are dropping one by one\r\ninto the grip of the usurer--getting hopelessly in debt--and are losing\r\ntheir high place and retiring to second and lower.  The Boer's farm does\r\nnot go to another Boer when he loses it, but to a foreigner.  Some have\r\nfallen so low that they sell their daughters to the blacks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nUnder date of another South African town I find the note which is\r\ncreditable to the Boers:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDr. X. told me that in the Kafir war 1,500 Kafirs took refuge in a great\r\ncave in the mountains about 90 miles north of Johannesburg, and the Boers\r\nblocked up the entrance and smoked them to death.  Dr. X. has been in\r\nthere and seen the great array of bleached skeletons--one a woman with\r\nthe skeleton of a child hugged to her breast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the savages must go.  The white man wants their lands,\r\nand all must go excepting such percentage of them as he will need to do\r\nhis work for him upon terms to be determined by himself.  Since history\r\nhas removed the element of guesswork from this matter and made it\r\ncertainty, the humanest way of diminishing the black population should be\r\nadopted, not the old cruel ways of the past.  Mr. Rhodes and his gang\r\nhave been following the old ways.--They are chartered to rob and slay,\r\nand they lawfully do it, but not in a compassionate and Christian spirit.\r\nThey rob the Mashonas and the Matabeles of a portion of their territories\r\nin the hallowed old style of \xe2\x80\x9cpurchase!\xe2\x80\x9d for a song, and then they force\r\na quarrel and take the rest by the strong hand.  They rob the natives of\r\ntheir cattle under the pretext that all the cattle in the country\r\nbelonged to the king whom they have tricked and assassinated.  They issue\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cregulations\xe2\x80\x9d requiring the incensed and harassed natives to work for the\r\nwhite settlers, and neglect their own affairs to do it.  This is slavery,\r\nand is several times worse than was the American slavery which used to\r\npain England so much; for when this Rhodesian slave is sick,\r\nsuper-annuated, or otherwise disabled, he must support himself\r\nor starve--his master is under no obligation to support him.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the population by Rhodesian methods to the desired limit\r\nis a return to the old-time slow-misery and lingering-death system of a\r\ndiscredited time and a crude \xe2\x80\x9ccivilization.\xe2\x80\x9d  We humanely reduce an\r\noverplus of dogs by swift chloroform; the Boer humanely reduced an\r\noverplus of blacks by swift suffocation; the nameless but right-hearted\r\nAustralian pioneer humanely reduced his overplus of aboriginal neighbors\r\nby a sweetened swift death concealed in a poisoned pudding.  All these\r\nare admirable, and worthy of praise; you and I would rather suffer either\r\nof these deaths thirty times over in thirty successive days than linger\r\nout one of the Rhodesian twenty-year deaths, with its daily burden of\r\ninsult, humiliation, and forced labor for a man whose entire race the\r\nvictim hates.  Rhodesia is a happy name for that land of piracy and\r\npillage, and puts the right stain upon it.\r\n\r\nSeveral long journeys--gave us experience of the Cape Colony railways;\r\neasy-riding, fine cars; all the conveniences; thorough cleanliness;\r\ncomfortable beds furnished for the night trains.  It was in the first\r\ndays of June, and winter; the daytime was pleasant, the nighttime nice\r\nand cold.  Spinning along all day in the cars it was ecstasy to breathe\r\nthe bracing air and gaze out over the vast brown solitudes of the velvet\r\nplains, soft and lovely near by, still softer and lovelier further away,\r\nsoftest and loveliest of all in the remote distances, where dim\r\nisland-hills seemed afloat, as in a sea--a sea made of dream-stuff and\r\nflushed with colors faint and rich; and dear me, the depth of the sky,\r\nand the beauty of the strange new cloud-forms, and the glory of the\r\nsunshine, the lavishness, the wastefulness of it!  The vigor and\r\nfreshness and inspiration of the air and the sun--well, it was all\r\njust as Olive Schreiner had made it in her books.\r\n\r\nTo me the veldt, in its sober winter garb, was surpassingly beautiful.\r\nThere were unlevel stretches where it was rolling and swelling, and\r\nrising and subsiding, and sweeping superbly on and on, and still on and\r\non like an ocean, toward the faraway horizon, its pale brown deepening by\r\ndelicately graduated shades to rich orange, and finally to purple and\r\ncrimson where it washed against the wooded hills and naked red crags at\r\nthe base of the sky.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, from Cape Town to Kimberley and from Kimberley to Port\r\nElizabeth and East London, the towns were well populated with tamed\r\nblacks; tamed and Christianized too, I suppose, for they wore the dowdy\r\nclothes of our Christian civilization.  But for that, many of them would\r\nhave been remarkably handsome.  These fiendish clothes, together with the\r\nproper lounging gait, good-natured face, happy air, and easy laugh, made\r\nthem precise counterparts of our American blacks; often where all the\r\nother aspects were strikingly and harmoniously and thrillingly African, a\r\nflock of these natives would intrude, looking wholly out of place, and\r\nspoil it all, making the thing a grating discord, half African and half\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday in King William's Town a score of colored women came mincing\r\nacross the great barren square dressed--oh, in the last perfection of\r\nfashion, and newness, and expensiveness, and showy mixture of unrelated\r\ncolors,--all just as I had seen it so often at home; and in their faces\r\nand their gait was that languishing, aristocratic, divine delight in\r\ntheir finery which was so familiar to me, and had always been such a\r\nsatisfaction to my eye and my heart.  I seemed among old, old friends;\r\nfriends of fifty years, and I stopped and cordially greeted them.  They\r\nbroke into a good-fellowship laugh, flashing their white teeth upon me,\r\nand all answered at once.  I did not understand a word they said.  I was\r\nastonished; I was not dreaming that they would answer in anything but\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nThe voices, too, of the African women, were familiar to me sweet and\r\nmusical, just like those of the slave women of my early days.  I followed\r\na couple of them all over the Orange Free State--no, over its capital\r\n--Bloemfontein, to hear their liquid voices and the happy ripple of their\r\nlaughter.  Their language was a large improvement upon American.  Also\r\nupon the Zulu.  It had no Zulu clicks in it; and it seemed to have no\r\nangles or corners, no roughness, no vile s's or other hissing sounds, but\r\nwas very, very mellow and rounded and flowing.\r\n\r\nIn moving about the country in the trains, I had opportunity to see a\r\ngood many Boers of the veldt.  One day at a village station a hundred of\r\nthem got out of the third-class cars to feed.\r\n\r\nTheir clothes were very interesting.  For ugliness of shapes, and for\r\nmiracles of ugly colors inharmoniously associated, they were a record.\r\nThe effect was nearly as exciting and interesting as that produced by the\r\nbrilliant and beautiful clothes and perfect taste always on view at the\r\nIndian railway stations.  One man had corduroy trousers of a faded\r\nchewing gum tint.  And they were new--showing that this tint did not come\r\nby calamity, but was intentional; the very ugliest color I have ever\r\nseen.  A gaunt, shackly country lout six feet high, in battered gray\r\nslouched hat with wide brim, and old resin-colored breeches, had on a\r\nhideous brand-new woolen coat which was imitation tiger skin--wavy broad\r\nstripes of dazzling yellow and deep brown.  I thought he ought to be\r\nhanged, and asked the station-master if it could be arranged.  He said\r\nno; and not only that, but said it rudely; said it with a quite\r\nunnecessary show of feeling.  Then he muttered something about my being a\r\njackass, and walked away and pointed me out to people, and did everything\r\nhe could to turn public sentiment against me.  It is what one gets for\r\ntrying to do good.\r\n\r\nIn the train that day a passenger told me some more about Boer life out\r\nin the lonely veldt.  He said the Boer gets up early and sets his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cniggers\xe2\x80\x9d at their tasks (pasturing the cattle, and watching them); eats,\r\nsmokes, drowses, sleeps; toward evening superintends the milking, etc.;\r\neats, smokes, drowses; goes to bed at early candlelight in the fragrant\r\nclothes he (and she) have worn all day and every week-day for years.  I\r\nremember that last detail, in Olive Schreiner's \xe2\x80\x9cStory of an African\r\nFarm.\xe2\x80\x9d  And the passenger told me that the Boers were justly noted for\r\ntheir hospitality.  He told me a story about it.  He said that his grace\r\nthe Bishop of a certain See was once making a business-progress through\r\nthe tavernless veldt, and one night he stopped with a Boer; after supper\r\nwas shown to bed; he undressed, weary and worn out, and was soon sound\r\nasleep; in the night he woke up feeling crowded and suffocated, and found\r\nthe old Boer and his fat wife in bed with him, one on each side, with all\r\ntheir clothes on, and snoring.  He had to stay there and stand it--awake\r\nand suffering--until toward dawn, when sleep again fell upon him for an\r\nhour.  Then he woke again.  The Boer was gone, but the wife was still at\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nThose Reformers detested that Boer prison; they were not used to cramped\r\nquarters and tedious hours, and weary idleness, and early to bed, and\r\nlimited movement, and arbitrary and irritating rules, and the absence of\r\nthe luxuries which wealth comforts the day and the night with.  The\r\nconfinement told upon their bodies and their spirits; still, they were\r\nsuperior men, and they made the best that was to be made of the\r\ncircumstances.  Their wives smuggled delicacies to them, which helped to\r\nsmooth the way down for the prison fare.\r\n\r\nIn the train Mr. B. told me that the Boer jail-guards treated the black\r\nprisoners--even political ones--mercilessly.  An African chief and his\r\nfollowing had been kept there nine months without trial, and during all\r\nthat time they had been without shelter from rain and sun.  He said that\r\none day the guards put a big black in the stocks for dashing his soup on\r\nthe ground; they stretched his legs painfully wide apart, and set him\r\nwith his back down hill; he could not endure it, and put back his hands\r\nupon the slope for a support.  The guard ordered him to withdraw the\r\nsupport and kicked him in the back.  \xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. B., \xe2\x80\x9c'the powerful\r\nblack wrenched the stocks asunder and went for the guard; a Reform\r\nprisoner pulled him off, and thrashed the guard himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nThe very ink with which all history is written is merely fluid prejudice.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilsons's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a Parallel of Latitude but thinks it would have been the\r\nEquator if it had had its rights.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nNext to Mr. Rhodes, to me the most interesting convulsion of nature in\r\nSouth Africa was the diamond-crater.  The Rand gold fields are a\r\nstupendous marvel, and they make all other gold fields small, but I was\r\nnot a stranger to gold-mining; the veldt was a noble thing to see, but it\r\nwas only another and lovelier variety of our Great Plains; the natives\r\nwere very far from being uninteresting, but they were not new; and as for\r\nthe towns, I could find my way without a guide through the most of them\r\nbecause I had learned the streets, under other names, in towns just like\r\nthem in other lands; but the diamond mine was a wholly fresh thing, a\r\nsplendid and absorbing novelty.  Very few people in the world have seen\r\nthe diamond in its home.  It has but three or four homes in the world,\r\nwhereas gold has a million.  It is worth while to journey around the\r\nglobe to see anything which can truthfully be called a novelty, and the\r\ndiamond mine is the greatest and most select and restricted novelty which\r\nthe globe has in stock.\r\n\r\nThe Kimberley diamond deposits were discovered about 1869, I think.  When\r\neverything is taken into consideration, the wonder is that they were not\r\ndiscovered five thousand years ago and made familiar to the African world\r\nfor the rest of time.  For this reason the first diamonds were found on\r\nthe surface of the ground.  They were smooth and limpid, and in the\r\nsunlight they vomited fire.  They were the very things which an African\r\nsavage of any era would value above every other thing in the world\r\nexcepting a glass bead.  For two or three centuries we have been buying\r\nhis lands, his cattle, his neighbor, and any other thing he had for sale,\r\nfor glass beads and so it is strange that he was indifferent to the\r\ndiamonds--for he must have picked them up many and many a time.  It\r\nwould not occur to him to try to sell them to whites, of course, since\r\nthe whites already had plenty of glass beads, and more fashionably\r\nshaped, too, than these; but one would think that the poorer sort of\r\nblack, who could not afford real glass, would have been humbly content to\r\ndecorate himself with the imitation, and that presently the white trader\r\nwould notice the things, and dimly suspect, and carry some of them home,\r\nand find out what they were, and at once empty a multitude of\r\nfortune-hunters into Africa.  There are many strange things in human\r\nhistory; one of the strangest is that the sparkling diamonds laid there\r\nso long without exciting any one's interest.\r\n\r\nThe revelation came at last by accident.  In a Boer's hut out in the wide\r\nsolitude of the plains, a traveling stranger noticed a child playing with\r\na bright object, and was told it was a piece of glass which had been\r\nfound in the veldt.  The stranger bought it for a trifle and carried it\r\naway; and being without honor, made another stranger believe it was a\r\ndiamond, and so got $125 out of him for it, and was as pleased with\r\nhimself as if he had done a righteous thing.  In Paris the wronged\r\nstranger sold it to a pawnshop for $10,000, who sold it to a countess for\r\n$90,000, who sold it to a brewer for $800,000, who traded it to a king\r\nfor a dukedom and a pedigree, and the king \xe2\x80\x9cput it up the spout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n --[handwritten note: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Greek meaning 'pawned it.'\xe2\x80\x9d M.T.]--I know\r\nthese particulars to be correct.\r\n\r\nThe news flew around, and the South African diamond-boom began.  The\r\noriginal traveler--the dishonest one--now remembered that he had once\r\nseen a Boer teamster chocking his wagon-wheel on a steep grade with a\r\ndiamond as large as a football, and he laid aside his occupations and\r\nstarted out to hunt for it, but not with the intention of cheating\r\nanybody out of $125 with it, for he had reformed.\r\n\r\nWe now come to matters more didactic.  Diamonds are not imbedded in rock\r\nledges fifty miles long, like the Johannesburg gold, but are distributed\r\nthrough the rubbish of a filled-up well, so to speak.  The well is rich,\r\nits walls are sharply defined; outside of the walls are no diamonds.  The\r\nwell is a crater, and a large one.  Before it had been meddled with, its\r\nsurface was even with the level plain, and there was no sign to suggest\r\nthat it was there.  The pasturage covering the surface of the Kimberley\r\ncrater was sufficient for the support of a cow, and the pasturage\r\nunderneath was sufficient for the support of a kingdom; but the cow did\r\nnot know it, and lost her chance.\r\n\r\nThe Kimberley crater is roomy enough to admit the Roman Coliseum; the\r\nbottom of the crater has not been reached, and no one can tell how far\r\ndown in the bowels of the earth it goes.  Originally, it was a\r\nperpendicular hole packed solidly full of blue rock or cement, and\r\nscattered through that blue mass, like raisins in a pudding, were the\r\ndiamonds.  As deep down in the earth as the blue stuff extends, so deep\r\nwill the diamonds be found.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four other celebrated craters near by--a circle three\r\nmiles in diameter would enclose them all.  They are owned by the De Beers\r\nCompany, a consolidation of diamond properties arranged by Mr. Rhodes\r\ntwelve or fourteen years ago.  The De Beers owns other craters; they are\r\nunder the grass, but the De Beers knows where they are, and will open\r\nthem some day, if the market should require it.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the diamond deposits were the property of the Orange Free\r\nState; but a judicious \xe2\x80\x9crectification\xe2\x80\x9d of the boundary line shifted them\r\nover into the British territory of Cape Colony.  A high official of the\r\nFree State told me that the sum of $400,000 was handed to his\r\ncommonwealth as a compromise, or indemnity, or something of the sort, and\r\nthat he thought his commonwealth did wisely to take the money and keep\r\nout of a dispute, since the power was all on the one side and the\r\nweakness all on the other.  The De Beers Company dig out $400,000 worth\r\nof diamonds per week, now.  The Cape got the territory, but no profit;\r\nfor Mr. Rhodes and the Rothschilds and the other De Beers people own the\r\nmines, and they pay no taxes.\r\n\r\nIn our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles, under the\r\nguidance of the ablest mining-engineering talent procurable in America.\r\nThere are elaborate works for reducing the blue rock and passing it\r\nthrough one process after another until every diamond it contains has\r\nbeen hunted down and secured.  I watched the \xe2\x80\x9cconcentrators\xe2\x80\x9d at work big\r\ntanks containing mud and water and invisible diamonds--and was told that\r\neach could stir and churn and properly treat 300 car-loads of mud per day\r\n1,600 pounds to the car-load--and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush.  I\r\nsaw the 3 carloads of slush taken to the \xe2\x80\x9cpulsators\xe2\x80\x9d and there reduced to\r\na quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand.  Then I followed it\r\nto the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out\r\nand brush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up.  I assisted,\r\nand once I found a diamond half as large as an almond.  It is an exciting\r\nkind of fishing, and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time you\r\ndetect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark\r\nsand.  I would like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sport\r\nevery now and then.  Of course there are disappointments.  Sometimes you\r\nfind a diamond which is not a diamond; it is only a quartz crystal or\r\nsome such worthless thing.  The expert can generally distinguish it from\r\nthe precious stone which it is counterfeiting; but if he is in doubt he\r\nlays it on a flatiron and hits it with a sledgehammer.  If it is a\r\ndiamond it holds its own; if it is anything else, it is reduced to\r\npowder.  I liked that experiment very much, and did not tire of\r\nrepetitions of it.  It was full of enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred by\r\nany personal sense of risk.  The De Beers concern treats 8,000 carloads\r\n--about 6,000 tons--of blue rock per day, and the result is three pounds\r\nof diamonds.  Value, uncut, $50,000 to $70,000.  After cutting, they will\r\nweigh considerably less than a pound, but will be worth four or five\r\ntimes as much as they were before.\r\n\r\nAll the plain around that region is spread over, a foot deep, with blue\r\nrock, placed there by the Company, and looks like a plowed field.\r\nExposure for a length of time make the rock easier to work than it is\r\nwhen it comes out of the mine.  If mining should cease now, the supply of\r\nrock spread over those fields would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads per\r\nday to the separating works during three years.  The fields are fenced\r\nand watched; and at night they are under the constant inspection of lofty\r\nelectric searchlight.  They contain fifty or sixty million dollars'\r\nworth' of diamonds, and there is an abundance of enterprising thieves\r\naround.\r\n\r\nIn the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden wealth.  Some\r\ntime ago the people were granted the privilege of a free wash-up.  There\r\nwas a general rush, the work was done with thoroughness, and a good\r\nharvest of diamonds was gathered.\r\n\r\nThe deep mining is done by natives.  There are many hundreds of them.\r\nThey live in quarters built around the inside of a great compound.  They\r\nare a jolly and good-natured lot, and accommodating.  They performed a\r\nwar-dance for us, which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen.\r\nThey are not allowed outside of the compound during their term of service\r\nthree months, I think it is, as a rule.  They go down the shaft, stand\r\ntheir watch, come up again, are searched, and go to bed or to their\r\namusements in the compound; and this routine they repeat, day in and day\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds successfully.\r\nThey used to swallow them, and find other ways of concealing them, but\r\nthe white man found ways of beating their various games.  One man cut his\r\nleg and shoved a diamond into the wound, but even that project did not\r\nsucceed.  When they find a fine large diamond they are more likely to\r\nreport it than to steal it, for in the former case they get a reward, and\r\nin the latter they are quite apt to merely get into trouble.  Some years\r\nago, in a mine not owned by the De Beers, a black found what has been\r\nclaimed to be the largest diamond known to the world's history; and, as a\r\nreward he was released from service and given a blanket, a horse, and\r\nfive hundred dollars.  It made him a Vanderbilt.  He could buy four\r\nwives, and have money left.  Four wives are an ample support for a\r\nnative.  With four wives he is wholly independent, and need never do a\r\nstroke of work again.\r\n\r\nThat great diamond weighs 97l carats.  Some say it is as big as a piece\r\nof alum, others say it is as large as a bite of rock candy, but the best\r\nauthorities agree that it is almost exactly the size of a chunk of ice.\r\nBut those details are not important; and in my opinion not trustworthy.\r\nIt has a flaw in it, otherwise it would be of incredible value.  As it\r\nis, it is held to be worth $2,000,000.  After cutting it ought to be\r\nworth from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000, therefore persons desiring to save\r\nmoney should buy it now.  It is owned by a syndicate, and apparently\r\nthere is no satisfactory market for it.  It is earning nothing; it is\r\neating its head off.  Up to this time it has made nobody rich but the\r\nnative who found it.\r\n\r\nHe found it in a mine which was being worked by contract.  That is to\r\nsay, a company had bought the privilege of taking from the mine 5,000,000\r\ncarloads of blue-rock, for a sum down and a royalty.  Their speculation\r\nhad not paid; but on the very day that their privilege ran out that\r\nnative found the $2,000,000-diamond and handed it over to them.  Even the\r\ndiamond culture is not without its romantic episodes.\r\n\r\nThe Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond, and valuable; but it cannot compete in\r\nthese matters with three which--according to legend--are among the crown\r\ntrinkets of Portugal and Russia.  One of these is held to be worth\r\n$20,000,000; another, $25,000,000, and the third something over\r\n$28,000,000.\r\n\r\nThose are truly wonderful diamonds, whether they exist or not; and yet\r\nthey are of but little importance by comparison with the one wherewith\r\nthe Boer wagoner chocked his wheel on that steep grade as heretofore\r\nreferred to.  In Kimberley I had some conversation with the man who saw\r\nthe Boer do that--an incident which had occurred twenty-seven or\r\ntwenty-eight years before I had my talk with him.  He assured me that\r\nthat diamond's value could have been over a billion dollars, but not\r\nunder it. I believed him, because he had devoted twenty-seven years to\r\nhunting for it, and was in a position to know.\r\n\r\nA fitting and interesting finish to an examination of the tedious and\r\nlaborious and costly processes whereby the diamonds are gotten out of the\r\ndeeps of the earth and freed from the base stuffs which imprison them is\r\nthe visit to the De Beers offices in the town of Kimberley, where the\r\nresult of each day's mining is brought every day, and, weighed, assorted,\r\nvalued, and deposited in safes against shipping-day.  An unknown and\r\nunaccredited person cannot get into that place; and it seemed apparent\r\nfrom the generous supply of warning and protective and prohibitory signs\r\nthat were posted all about, that not even the known and accredited can\r\nsteal diamonds there without inconvenience.\r\n\r\nWe saw the day's output--shining little nests of diamonds, distributed a\r\nfoot apart, along a counter, each nest reposing upon a sheet of white\r\npaper.  That day's catch was about $70,000 worth.  In the course of a\r\nyear half a ton of diamonds pass under the scales there and sleep on that\r\ncounter; the resulting money is $18,000,000 or $20,000,000.  Profit,\r\nabout $12,000,000.\r\n\r\nYoung girls were doing the sorting--a nice, clean, dainty, and probably\r\ndistressing employment.  Every day ducal incomes sift and sparkle through\r\nthe fingers of those young girls; yet they go to bed at night as poor as\r\nthey were when they got up in the morning.  The same thing next day, and\r\nall the days.\r\n\r\nThey are beautiful things, those diamonds, in their native state.  They\r\nare of various shapes; they have flat surfaces, rounded borders, and\r\nnever a sharp edge.  They are of all colors and shades of color, from\r\ndewdrop white to actual black; and their smooth and rounded surfaces and\r\ncontours, variety of color, and transparent limpidity make them look like\r\npiles of assorted candies.  A very light straw color is their commonest\r\ntint.  It seemed to me that these uncut gems must be more beautiful than\r\nany cut ones could be; but when a collection of cut ones was brought out,\r\nI saw my mistake.  Nothing is so beautiful as a rose diamond with the\r\nlight playing through it, except that uncostly thing which is just like\r\nit--wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through it and striking a\r\nwhite-sand bottom.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of July we reached Cape Town, and the end of our\r\nAfrican journeyings.  And well satisfied; for, towering above us was\r\nTable Mountain--a reminder that we had now seen each and all of the great\r\nfeatures of South Africa except Mr. Cecil Rhodes.  I realize that that is\r\na large exception.  I know quite well that whether Mr. Rhodes is the\r\nlofty and worshipful patriot and statesman that multitudes believe him to\r\nbe, or Satan come again, as the rest of the world account him, he is\r\nstill the most imposing figure in the British empire outside of England.\r\nWhen he stands on the Cape of Good Hope, his shadow falls to the Zambesi.\r\nHe is the only colonial in the British dominions whose goings and comings\r\nare chronicled and discussed under all the globe's meridians, and whose\r\nspeeches, unclipped, are cabled from the ends of the earth; and he is the\r\nonly unroyal outsider whose arrival in London can compete for attention\r\nwith an eclipse.\r\n\r\nThat he is an extraordinary man, and not an accident of fortune, not even\r\nhis dearest South African enemies were willing to deny, so far as I heard\r\nthem testify.  The whole South African world seemed to stand in a kind of\r\nshuddering awe of him, friend and enemy alike.  It was as if he were\r\ndeputy-God on the one side, deputy-Satan on the other, proprietor of the\r\npeople, able to make them or ruin them by his breath, worshiped by many,\r\nhated by many, but blasphemed by none among the judicious, and even by\r\nthe indiscreet in guarded whispers only.\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret of his formidable supremacy?  One says it is his\r\nprodigious wealth--a wealth whose drippings in salaries and in other ways\r\nsupport multitudes and make them his interested and loyal vassals;\r\nanother says it is his personal magnetism and his persuasive tongue, and\r\nthat these hypnotize and make happy slaves of all that drift within the\r\ncircle of their influence; another says it is his majestic ideas, his\r\nvast schemes for the territorial aggrandizement of England, his patriotic\r\nand unselfish ambition to spread her beneficent protection and her just\r\nrule over the pagan wastes of Africa and make luminous the African\r\ndarkness with the glory of her name; and another says he wants the earth\r\nand wants it for his own, and that the belief that he will get it and let\r\nhis friends in on the ground floor is the secret that rivets so many eyes\r\nupon him and keeps him in the zenith where the view is unobstructed.\r\n\r\nOne may take his choice.  They are all the same price.  One fact is sure:\r\nhe keeps his prominence and a vast following, no matter what he does.  He\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdeceives\xe2\x80\x9d the Duke of Fife--it is the Duke's word--but that does not\r\ndestroy the Duke's loyalty to him.  He tricks the Reformers into immense\r\ntrouble with his Raid, but the most of them believe he meant well.  He\r\nweeps over the harshly-taxed Johannesburgers and makes them his friends;\r\nat the same time he taxes his Charter-settlers 50 per cent., and so wins\r\ntheir affection and their confidence that they are squelched with despair\r\nat every rumor that the Charter is to be annulled.  He raids and robs and\r\nslays and enslaves the Matabele and gets worlds of Charter-Christian\r\napplause for it.  He has beguiled England into buying Charter waste paper\r\nfor Bank of England notes, ton for ton, and the ravished still burn\r\nincense to him as the Eventual God of Plenty.  He has done everything he\r\ncould think of to pull himself down to the ground; he has done more than\r\nenough to pull sixteen common-run great men down; yet there he stands, to\r\nthis day, upon his dizzy summit under the dome of the sky, an apparent\r\npermanency, the marvel of the time, the mystery of the age, an Archangel\r\nwith wings to half the world, Satan with a tail to the other half.\r\n\r\nI admire him, I frankly confess it; and when his time comes I shall buy a\r\npiece of the rope for a keepsake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI have traveled more than anyone else, and I have noticed that even the\r\nangels speak English with an accent.\r\n                                  --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.\r\n\r\nI saw Table Rock, anyway--a majestic pile.  It is 3,000 feet high.  It is\r\nalso 17,000 feet high.  These figures may be relied upon.  I got them in\r\nCape Town from the two best-informed citizens, men who had made Table\r\nRock the study of their lives.  And I saw Table Bay, so named for its\r\nlevelness.  I saw the Castle--built by the Dutch East India Company three\r\nhundred years ago--where the Commanding General lives; I saw St. Simon's\r\nBay, where the Admiral lives.  I saw the Government, also the Parliament,\r\nwhere they quarreled in two languages when I was there, and agreed in\r\nnone.  I saw the club.  I saw and explored the beautiful sea-girt drives\r\nthat wind about the mountains and through the paradise where the villas\r\nare: Also I saw some of the fine old Dutch mansions, pleasant homes of\r\nthe early times, pleasant homes to-day, and enjoyed the privilege of\r\ntheir hospitalities.\r\n\r\nAnd just before I sailed I saw in one of them a quaint old picture which\r\nwas a link in a curious romance--a picture of a pale, intellectual young\r\nman in a pink coat with a high black collar.  It was a portrait of Dr.\r\nJames Barry, a military surgeon who came out to the Cape fifty years ago\r\nwith his regiment.  He was a wild young fellow, and was guilty of various\r\nkinds of misbehavior.  He was several times reported to headquarters in\r\nEngland, and it was in each case expected that orders would come out to\r\ndeal with him promptly and severely, but for some mysterious reason no\r\norders of any kind ever came back--nothing came but just an impressive\r\nsilence.  This made him an imposing and uncanny wonder to the town.\r\n\r\nNext, he was promoted--away up.  He was made Medical Superintendent\r\nGeneral, and transferred to India.  Presently he was back at the Cape\r\nagain and at his escapades once more.  There were plenty of pretty girls,\r\nbut none of them caught him, none of them could get hold of his heart;\r\nevidently he was not a marrying man.  And that was another marvel,\r\nanother puzzle, and made no end of perplexed talk.  Once he was called in\r\nthe night, an obstetric service, to do what he could for a woman who was\r\nbelieved to be dying.  He was prompt and scientific, and saved both\r\nmother and child.  There are other instances of record which testify to\r\nhis mastership of his profession; and many which testify to his love of\r\nit and his devotion to it.  Among other adventures of his was a duel of a\r\ndesperate sort, fought with swords, at the Castle.  He killed his man.\r\n\r\nThe child heretofore mentioned as having been saved by Dr. Barry so long\r\nago, was named for him, and still lives in Cape Town.  He had Dr.\r\nBarry's portrait painted, and gave it to the gentleman in whose old Dutch\r\nhouse I saw it--the quaint figure in pink coat and high black collar.\r\n\r\nThe story seems to be arriving nowhere.  But that is because I have not\r\nfinished.  Dr. Barry died in Cape Town 30 years ago.  It was then\r\ndiscovered that he was A WOMAN.\r\n\r\nThe legend goes that enquiries--soon silenced--developed the fact that\r\nshe was a daughter of a great English house, and that that was why her\r\nCape wildnesses brought no punishment and got no notice when reported to\r\nthe government at home.  Her name was an alias.  She had disgraced\r\nherself with her people; so she chose to change her name and her sex and\r\ntake a new start in the world.\r\n\r\nWe sailed on the 15th of July in the Norman, a beautiful ship, perfectly\r\nappointed.  The voyage to England occupied a short fortnight, without a\r\nstop except at Madeira.  A good and restful voyage for tired people, and\r\nthere were several of us.  I seemed to have been lecturing a thousand\r\nyears, though it was only a twelvemonth, and a considerable number of the\r\nothers were Reformers who were fagged out with their five months of\r\nseclusion in the Pretoria prison.\r\n\r\nOur trip around the earth ended at the Southampton pier, where we\r\nembarked thirteen months before.  It seemed a fine and large thing to\r\nhave accomplished--the circumnavigation of this great globe in that\r\nlittle time, and I was privately proud of it.  For a moment.\r\nThen came one of those vanity-snubbing astronomical reports from the\r\nObservatory-people, whereby it appeared that another great body of light\r\nhad lately flamed up in the remotenesses of space which was traveling at\r\na gait which would enable it to do all that I had done in a minute and a\r\nhalf. Human pride is not worth while; there is always something lying in\r\nwait to take the wind out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Following the Equator, Complete\r\nby Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FOLLOWING THE EQUATOR, COMPLETE\r\n***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2895-0.txt or 2895-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        https://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/9/2895/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttps://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit https://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     https://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n"
