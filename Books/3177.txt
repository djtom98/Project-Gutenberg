It is a record of several years of\r\nvariegated vagabondizing, and its object is rather to help the resting\r\nreader while away an idle hour than afflict him with metaphysics, or\r\ngoad him with science. Still, there is information in the volume;\r\ninformation concerning an interesting episode in the history of the Far\r\nWest, about which no books have been written by persons who were on the\r\nground in person, and saw the happenings of the time with their own\r\neyes. I allude to the rise, growth and culmination of the silver-mining\r\nfever in Nevada\xe2\x80\x94a curious episode, in some respects; the only one, of\r\nits peculiar kind, that has occurred in the land; and the only one,\r\nindeed, that is likely to occur in it.\r\n\r\nYes, take it all around, there is quite a good deal of information in\r\nthe book. I regret this very much; but really it could not be helped:\r\ninformation appears to stew out of me naturally, like the precious ottar\r\nof roses out of the otter. Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would\r\ngive worlds if I could retain my facts; but it cannot be. The more I\r\ncalk up the sources, and the tighter I get, the more I leak wisdom.\r\nTherefore, I can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader, not\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy brother had just been appointed Secretary of Nevada Territory\xe2\x80\x94an\r\noffice of such majesty that it concentrated in itself the duties and\r\ndignities of Treasurer, Comptroller, Secretary of State, and Acting\r\nGovernor in the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s absence. A salary of eighteen hundred dollars\r\na year and the title of \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Secretary,\xe2\x80\x9d gave to the great position an\r\nair of wild and imposing grandeur. I was young and ignorant, and I\r\nenvied my brother. I coveted his distinction and his financial splendor,\r\nbut particularly and especially the long, strange journey he was going\r\nto make, and the curious new world he was going to explore. He was going\r\nto travel! I never had been away from home, and that word \xe2\x80\x9ctravel\xe2\x80\x9d had a\r\nseductive charm for me. Pretty soon he would be hundreds and hundreds of\r\nmiles away on the great plains and deserts, and among the mountains of\r\nthe Far West, and would see buffaloes and Indians, and prairie dogs, and\r\nantelopes, and have all kinds of adventures, and may be get hanged or\r\nscalped, and have ever such a fine time, and write home and tell us all\r\nabout it, and be a hero. And he would see the gold mines and the silver\r\nmines, and maybe go about of an afternoon when his work was done, and\r\npick up two or three pailfuls of shining slugs, and nuggets of gold and\r\nsilver on the hillside. And by and by he would become very rich, and\r\nreturn home by sea, and be able to talk as calmly about San Francisco\r\nand the ocean, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe isthmus\xe2\x80\x9d as if it was nothing of any consequence\r\nto have seen those marvels face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n020.jpg (69K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I suffered in contemplating his happiness, pen cannot describe. And\r\nso, when he offered me, in cold blood, the sublime position of private\r\nsecretary under him, it appeared to me that the heavens and the earth\r\npassed away, and the firmament was rolled together as a scroll! I had\r\nnothing more to desire. My contentment was complete.\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour or two I was ready for the journey. Not much\r\npacking up was necessary, because we were going in the overland stage\r\nfrom the Missouri frontier to Nevada, and passengers were only allowed a\r\nsmall quantity of baggage apiece. There was no Pacific railroad in those\r\nfine times of ten or twelve years ago\xe2\x80\x94not a single rail of it. I only\r\nproposed to stay in Nevada three months\xe2\x80\x94I had no thought of staying\r\nlonger than that. I meant to see all I could that was new and strange,\r\nand then hurry home to business. I little thought that I would not see\r\nthe end of that three-month pleasure excursion for six or seven\r\nuncommonly long years!\r\n\r\nI dreamed all night about Indians, deserts, and silver bars, and in due\r\ntime, next day, we took shipping at the St. Louis wharf on board a\r\nsteamboat bound up the Missouri River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n021.jpg (82K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were six days going from St. Louis to \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Jo.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a trip that was so\r\ndull, and sleepy, and eventless that it has left no more impression on\r\nmy memory than if its duration had been six minutes instead of that many\r\ndays. No record is left in my mind, now, concerning it, but a confused\r\njumble of savage-looking snags, which we deliberately walked over with\r\none wheel or the other; and of reefs which we butted and butted, and\r\nthen retired from and climbed over in some softer place; and of sand-\r\nbars which we roosted on occasionally, and rested, and then got out our\r\ncrutches and sparred over.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the boat might almost as well have gone to St. Jo. by land, for\r\nshe was walking most of the time, anyhow\xe2\x80\x94climbing over reefs and\r\nclambering over snags patiently and laboriously all day long. The\r\ncaptain said she was a \xe2\x80\x9cbully\xe2\x80\x9d boat, and all she wanted was more \xe2\x80\x9cshear\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand a bigger wheel. I thought she wanted a pair of stilts, but I had the\r\ndeep sagacity not to say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHaPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing we did on that glad evening that landed us at St. Joseph\r\nwas to hunt up the stage-office, and pay a hundred and fifty dollars\r\napiece for tickets per overland coach to Carson City, Nevada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n023a.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, bright and early, we took a hasty breakfast, and\r\nhurried to the starting-place. Then an inconvenience presented itself\r\nwhich we had not properly appreciated before, namely, that one cannot\r\nmake a heavy traveling trunk stand for twenty-five pounds of\r\nbaggage\xe2\x80\x94because it weighs a good deal more. But that was all we could\r\ntake\xe2\x80\x94twenty-five pounds each. So we had to snatch our trunks open, and\r\nmake a selection in a good deal of a hurry. We put our lawful twenty-\r\nfive pounds apiece all in one valise, and shipped the trunks back to St.\r\nLouis again. It was a sad parting, for now we had no swallow-tail coats\r\nand white kid gloves to wear at Pawnee receptions in the Rocky\r\nMountains, and no stove-pipe hats nor patent-leather boots, nor anything\r\nelse necessary to make life calm and peaceful. We were reduced to a war-\r\nfooting. Each of us put on a rough, heavy suit of clothing, woolen army\r\nshirt and \xe2\x80\x9cstogy\xe2\x80\x9d boots included; and into the valise we crowded a few\r\nwhite shirts, some under-clothing and such things. My brother, the\r\nSecretary, took along about four pounds of United States statutes and\r\nsix pounds of Unabridged Dictionary; for we did not know\xe2\x80\x94poor\r\ninnocents\xe2\x80\x94that such things could be bought in San Francisco on one day\r\nand received in Carson City the next. I was armed to the teeth with a\r\npitiful little Smith & Wesson\xe2\x80\x99s seven-shooter, which carried a ball like\r\na homoeopathic pill, and it took the whole seven to make a dose for an\r\nadult. But I thought it was grand. It appeared to me to be a dangerous\r\nweapon. It only had one fault\xe2\x80\x94you could not hit anything with it. One of\r\nour \xe2\x80\x9cconductors\xe2\x80\x9d practiced awhile on a cow with it, and as long as she\r\nstood still and behaved herself she was safe; but as soon as she went to\r\nmoving about, and he got to shooting at other things, she came to grief.\r\nThe Secretary had a small-sized Colt\xe2\x80\x99s revolver strapped around him for\r\nprotection against the Indians, and to guard against accidents he\r\ncarried it uncapped. Mr. George Bemis was dismally formidable. George\r\nBemis was our fellow-traveler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n023b.jpg (11K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had never seen him before. He wore in his belt an old original\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllen\xe2\x80\x9d revolver, such as irreverent people called a \xe2\x80\x9cpepper-box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nSimply drawing the trigger back, cocked and fired the pistol. As the\r\ntrigger came back, the hammer would begin to rise and the barrel to turn\r\nover, and presently down would drop the hammer, and away would speed the\r\nball. To aim along the turning barrel and hit the thing aimed at was a\r\nfeat which was probably never done with an \xe2\x80\x9cAllen\xe2\x80\x9d in the world. But\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s was a reliable weapon, nevertheless, because, as one of the\r\nstage-drivers afterward said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she didn\xe2\x80\x99t get what she went after,\r\nshe would fetch something else.\xe2\x80\x9d And so she did. She went after a deuce\r\nof spades nailed against a tree, once, and fetched a mule standing about\r\nthirty yards to the left of it. Bemis did not want the mule; but the\r\nowner came out with a double-barreled shotgun and persuaded him to buy\r\nit, anyhow. It was a cheerful weapon\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cAllen.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes all its six\r\nbarrels would go off at once, and then there was no safe place in all\r\nthe region round about, but behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n024.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe took two or three blankets for protection against frosty weather in\r\nthe mountains. In the matter of luxuries we were modest\xe2\x80\x94we took none\r\nalong but some pipes and five pounds of smoking tobacco. We had two\r\nlarge canteens to carry water in, between stations on the Plains, and we\r\nalso took with us a little shot-bag of silver coin for daily expenses in\r\nthe way of breakfasts and dinners.\r\n\r\nBy eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock everything was ready, and we were on the other side of\r\nthe river. We jumped into the stage, the driver cracked his whip, and we\r\nbowled away and left \xe2\x80\x9cthe States\xe2\x80\x9d behind us. It was a superb summer\r\nmorning, and all the landscape was brilliant with sunshine. There was a\r\nfreshness and breeziness, too, and an exhilarating sense of emancipation\r\nfrom all sorts of cares and responsibilities, that almost made us feel\r\nthat the years we had spent in the close, hot city, toiling and slaving,\r\nhad been wasted and thrown away. We were spinning along through Kansas,\r\nand in the course of an hour and a half we were fairly abroad on the\r\ngreat Plains. Just here the land was rolling\xe2\x80\x94a grand sweep of regular\r\nelevations and depressions as far as the eye could reach\xe2\x80\x94like the\r\nstately heave and swell of the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s bosom after a storm. And\r\neverywhere were cornfields, accenting with squares of deeper green, this\r\nlimitless expanse of grassy land. But presently this sea upon dry ground\r\nwas to lose its \xe2\x80\x9crolling\xe2\x80\x9d character and stretch away for seven hundred\r\nmiles as level as a floor!\r\n\r\nOur coach was a great swinging and swaying stage, of the most sumptuous\r\ndescription\xe2\x80\x94an imposing cradle on wheels. It was drawn by six handsome\r\nhorses, and by the side of the driver sat the \xe2\x80\x9cconductor,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\nlegitimate captain of the craft; for it was his business to take charge\r\nand care of the mails, baggage, express matter, and passengers. We three\r\nwere the only passengers, this trip. We sat on the back seat, inside.\r\nAbout all the rest of the coach was full of mail bags\xe2\x80\x94for we had three\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x99 delayed mails with us. Almost touching our knees, a perpendicular\r\nwall of mail matter rose up to the roof. There was a great pile of it\r\nstrapped on top of the stage, and both the fore and hind boots were\r\nfull. We had twenty-seven hundred pounds of it aboard, the driver\r\nsaid\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca little for Brigham, and Carson, and \xe2\x80\x99Frisco, but the heft of it\r\nfor the Injuns, which is powerful troublesome \xe2\x80\x99thout they get plenty of\r\ntruck to read.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n026.jpg (65K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as he just then got up a fearful convulsion of his countenance which\r\nwas suggestive of a wink being swallowed by an earthquake, we guessed\r\nthat his remark was intended to be facetious, and to mean that we would\r\nunload the most of our mail matter somewhere on the Plains and leave it\r\nto the Indians, or whosoever wanted it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n025.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe changed horses every ten miles, all day long, and fairly flew over\r\nthe hard, level road. We jumped out and stretched our legs every time\r\nthe coach stopped, and so the night found us still vivacious and\r\nunfatigued.\r\n\r\nAfter supper a woman got in, who lived about fifty miles further on, and\r\nwe three had to take turns at sitting outside with the driver and\r\nconductor. Apparently she was not a talkative woman. She would sit there\r\nin the gathering twilight and fasten her steadfast eyes on a mosquito\r\nrooting into her arm, and slowly she would raise her other hand till she\r\nhad got his range, and then she would launch a slap at him that would\r\nhave jolted a cow; and after that she would sit and contemplate the\r\ncorpse with tranquil satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94for she never missed her mosquito; she\r\nwas a dead shot at short range. She never removed a carcase, but left\r\nthem there for bait. I sat by this grim Sphynx and watched her kill\r\nthirty or forty mosquitoes\xe2\x80\x94watched her, and waited for her to say\r\nsomething, but she never did. So I finally opened the conversation\r\nmyself. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mosquitoes are pretty bad, about here, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I understand you to say, madam?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou BET!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n027.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen she cheered up, and faced around and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDanged if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t begin to think you fellers was deef and dumb. I did,\r\nb\xe2\x80\x99gosh. Here I\xe2\x80\x99ve sot, and sot, and sot, a-bust\xe2\x80\x99n muskeeters and\r\nwonderin\xe2\x80\x99 what was ailin\xe2\x80\x99 ye. Fust I thot you was deef and dumb, then I\r\nthot you was sick or crazy, or suthin\xe2\x80\x99, and then by and by I begin to\r\nreckon you was a passel of sickly fools that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of nothing\r\nto say. Wher\xe2\x80\x99d ye come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Sphynx was a Sphynx no more! The fountains of her great deep were\r\nbroken up, and she rained the nine parts of speech forty days and forty\r\nnights, metaphorically speaking, and buried us under a desolating deluge\r\nof trivial gossip that left not a crag or pinnacle of rejoinder\r\nprojecting above the tossing waste of dislocated grammar and decomposed\r\npronunciation!\r\n\r\nHow we suffered, suffered, suffered! She went on, hour after hour, till\r\nI was sorry I ever opened the mosquito question and gave her a start.\r\nShe never did stop again until she got to her journey\xe2\x80\x99s end toward\r\ndaylight; and then she stirred us up as she was leaving the stage (for\r\nwe were nodding, by that time), and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you git out at Cottonwood, you fellers, and lay over a couple o\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndays, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be along some time to-night, and if I can do ye any good\r\nby edgin\xe2\x80\x99 in a word now and then, I\xe2\x80\x99m right thar. Folks\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve always ben kind o\xe2\x80\x99 offish and partic\xe2\x80\x99lar for a gal that\xe2\x80\x99s raised in\r\nthe woods, and I am, with the rag-tag and bob-tail, and a gal _has_ to\r\nbe, if she wants to _be_ anything, but when people comes along which is\r\nmy equals, I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99m a pretty sociable heifer after all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe resolved not to \xe2\x80\x9clay by at Cottonwood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout an hour and a half before daylight we were bowling along smoothly\r\nover the road\xe2\x80\x94so smoothly that our cradle only rocked in a gentle,\r\nlulling way, that was gradually soothing us to sleep, and dulling our\r\nconsciousness\xe2\x80\x94when something gave away under us! We were dimly aware of\r\nit, but indifferent to it. The coach stopped. We heard the driver and\r\nconductor talking together outside, and rummaging for a lantern, and\r\nswearing because they could not find it\xe2\x80\x94but we had no interest in\r\nwhatever had happened, and it only added to our comfort to think of\r\nthose people out there at work in the murky night, and we snug in our\r\nnest with the curtains drawn. But presently, by the sounds, there seemed\r\nto be an examination going on, and then the driver\xe2\x80\x99s voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy George, the thoroughbrace is broke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis startled me broad awake\xe2\x80\x94as an undefined sense of calamity is always\r\napt to do. I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cNow, a thoroughbrace is probably part of a\r\nhorse; and doubtless a vital part, too, from the dismay in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice. Leg, maybe\xe2\x80\x94and yet how could he break his leg waltzing along such\r\na road as this? No, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be his leg. That is impossible, unless he\r\nwas reaching for the driver. Now, what can be the thoroughbrace of a\r\nhorse, I wonder? Well, whatever comes, I shall not air my ignorance in\r\nthis crowd, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then the conductor\xe2\x80\x99s face appeared at a lifted curtain, and his\r\nlantern glared in on us and our wall of mail matter. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cGents,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to turn out a spell. Thoroughbrace is broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe climbed out into a chill drizzle, and felt ever so homeless and\r\ndreary. When I found that the thing they called a \xe2\x80\x9cthoroughbrace\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe massive combination of belts and springs which the coach rocks\r\nitself in, I said to the driver:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw a thoroughbrace used up like that, before, that I can\r\nremember. How did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, it happened by trying to make one coach carry three days\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmail\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s how it happened,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd right here is the very\r\ndirection which is wrote on all the newspaper-bags which was to be put\r\nout for the Injuns for to keep \xe2\x80\x99em quiet. It\xe2\x80\x99s most uncommon lucky,\r\nbecuz it\xe2\x80\x99s so nation dark I should \xe2\x80\x99a\xe2\x80\x99 gone by unbeknowns if that air\r\nthoroughbrace hadn\xe2\x80\x99t broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew that he was in labor with another of those winks of his, though I\r\ncould not see his face, because he was bent down at work; and wishing\r\nhim a safe delivery, I turned to and helped the rest get out the mail-\r\nsacks. It made a great pyramid by the roadside when it was all out. When\r\nthey had mended the thoroughbrace we filled the two boots again, but put\r\nno mail on top, and only half as much inside as there was before. The\r\nconductor bent all the seat-backs down, and then filled the coach just\r\nhalf full of mail-bags from end to end. We objected loudly to this, for\r\nit left us no seats. But the conductor was wiser than we, and said a bed\r\nwas better than seats, and moreover, this plan would protect his\r\nthoroughbraces. We never wanted any seats after that. The lazy bed was\r\ninfinitely preferable. I had many an exciting day, subsequently, lying\r\non it reading the statutes and the dictionary, and wondering how the\r\ncharacters would turn out.\r\n\r\nThe conductor said he would send back a guard from the next station to\r\ntake charge of the abandoned mail-bags, and we drove on.\r\n\r\nIt was now just dawn; and as we stretched our cramped legs full length\r\non the mail sacks, and gazed out through the windows across the wide\r\nwastes of greensward clad in cool, powdery mist, to where there was an\r\nexpectant look in the eastern horizon, our perfect enjoyment took the\r\nform of a tranquil and contented ecstasy. The stage whirled along at a\r\nspanking gait, the breeze flapping curtains and suspended coats in a\r\nmost exhilarating way; the cradle swayed and swung luxuriously, the\r\npattering of the horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs, the cracking of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s whip, and\r\nhis \xe2\x80\x9cHi-yi! g\xe2\x80\x99lang!\xe2\x80\x9d were music; the spinning ground and the waltzing\r\ntrees appeared to give us a mute hurrah as we went by, and then slack up\r\nand look after us with interest, or envy, or something; and as we lay\r\nand smoked the pipe of peace and compared all this luxury with the years\r\nof tiresome city life that had gone before it, we felt that there was\r\nonly one complete and satisfying happiness in the world, and we had\r\nfound it.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, at some station whose name I have forgotten, we three\r\nclimbed up on the seat behind the driver, and let the conductor have our\r\nbed for a nap. And by and by, when the sun made me drowsy, I lay down on\r\nmy face on top of the coach, grasping the slender iron railing, and\r\nslept for an hour or more. That will give one an appreciable idea of\r\nthose matchless roads. Instinct will make a sleeping man grip a fast\r\nhold of the railing when the stage jolts, but when it only swings and\r\nsways, no grip is necessary. Overland drivers and conductors used to sit\r\nin their places and sleep thirty or forty minutes at a time, on good\r\nroads, while spinning along at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour. I\r\nsaw them do it, often. There was no danger about it; a sleeping man\r\n_will_ seize the irons in time when the coach jolts. These men were hard\r\nworked, and it _was_ not possible for them to stay awake all the time.\r\n\r\nBy and by we passed through Marysville, and over the Big Blue and Little\r\nSandy; thence about a mile, and entered Nebraska. About a mile further\r\non, we came to the Big Sandy\xe2\x80\x94one hundred and eighty miles from St.\r\nJoseph.\r\n\r\nAs the sun was going down, we saw the first specimen of an animal known\r\nfamiliarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desert\xe2\x80\x94from Kansas\r\nclear to the Pacific Ocean\xe2\x80\x94as the \xe2\x80\x9cjackass rabbit.\xe2\x80\x9d He is well named. He\r\nis just like any other rabbit, except that he is from one third to twice\r\nas large, has longer legs in proportion to his size, and has the most\r\npreposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature _but_ a\r\njackass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n032.jpg (27K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he is sitting quiet, thinking about his sins, or is absent-minded\r\nor unapprehensive of danger, his majestic ears project above him\r\nconspicuously; but the breaking of a twig will scare him nearly to\r\ndeath, and then he tilts his ears back gently and starts for home. All\r\nyou can see, then, for the next minute, is his long gray form stretched\r\nout straight and \xe2\x80\x9cstreaking it\xe2\x80\x9d through the low sage-brush, head erect,\r\neyes right, and ears just canted a little to the rear, but showing you\r\nwhere the animal is, all the time, the same as if he carried a jib. Now\r\nand then he makes a marvelous spring with his long legs, high over the\r\nstunted sage-brush, and scores a leap that would make a horse envious.\r\nPresently he comes down to a long, graceful \xe2\x80\x9clope,\xe2\x80\x9d and shortly he\r\nmysteriously disappears. He has crouched behind a sage-bush, and will\r\nsit there and listen and tremble until you get within six feet of him,\r\nwhen he will get under way again. But one must shoot at this creature\r\nonce, if he wishes to see him throw his heart into his heels, and do the\r\nbest he knows how. He is frightened clear through, now, and he lays his\r\nlong ears down on his back, straightens himself out like a yard-stick\r\nevery spring he makes, and scatters miles behind him with an easy\r\nindifference that is enchanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n033a.jpg (35K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur party made this specimen \xe2\x80\x9chump himself,\xe2\x80\x9d as the conductor said. The\r\nsecretary started him with a shot from the Colt; I commenced spitting at\r\nhim with my weapon; and all in the same instant the old \xe2\x80\x9cAllen\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d whole\r\nbroadside let go with a rattling crash, and it is not putting it too\r\nstrong to say that the rabbit was frantic! He dropped his ears, set up\r\nhis tail, and left for San Francisco at a speed which can only be\r\ndescribed as a flash and a vanish! Long after he was out of sight we\r\ncould hear him whiz.\r\n\r\nI do not remember where we first came across \xe2\x80\x9csage-brush,\xe2\x80\x9d but as I have\r\nbeen speaking of it I may as well describe it.\r\n\r\nThis is easily done, for if the reader can imagine a gnarled and\r\nvenerable live oak-tree reduced to a little shrub two feet-high, with\r\nits rough bark, its foliage, its twisted boughs, all complete, he can\r\npicture the \xe2\x80\x9csage-brush\xe2\x80\x9d exactly. Often, on lazy afternoons in the\r\nmountains, I have lain on the ground with my face under a sage-bush, and\r\nentertained myself with fancying that the gnats among its foliage were\r\nliliputian birds, and that the ants marching and countermarching about\r\nits base were liliputian flocks and herds, and myself some vast loafer\r\nfrom Brobdignag waiting to catch a little citizen and eat him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n033b.jpg (30K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an imposing monarch of the forest in exquisite miniature, is the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csage-brush.\xe2\x80\x9d Its foliage is a grayish green, and gives that tint to\r\ndesert and mountain. It smells like our domestic sage, and \xe2\x80\x9csage-tea\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmade from it taste like the sage-tea which all boys are so well\r\nacquainted with. The sage-brush is a singularly hardy plant, and grows\r\nright in the midst of deep sand, and among barren rocks, where nothing\r\nelse in the vegetable world would try to grow, except \xe2\x80\x9cbunch-\r\ngrass.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94[\xe2\x80\x9cBunch-grass\xe2\x80\x9d grows on the bleak mountain-sides of Nevada and\r\nneighboring territories, and offers excellent feed for stock, even in\r\nthe dead of winter, wherever the snow is blown aside and exposes it;\r\nnotwithstanding its unpromising home, bunch-grass is a better and more\r\nnutritious diet for cattle and horses than almost any other hay or grass\r\nthat is known\xe2\x80\x94so stock-men say.]\xe2\x80\x94The sage-bushes grow from three to six\r\nor seven feet apart, all over the mountains and deserts of the Far West,\r\nclear to the borders of California. There is not a tree of any kind in\r\nthe deserts, for hundreds of miles\xe2\x80\x94there is no vegetation at all in a\r\nregular desert, except the sage-brush and its cousin the \xe2\x80\x9cgreasewood,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich is so much like the sage-brush that the difference amounts to\r\nlittle. Camp-fires and hot suppers in the deserts would be impossible\r\nbut for the friendly sage-brush. Its trunk is as large as a boy\xe2\x80\x99s wrist\r\n(and from that up to a man\xe2\x80\x99s arm), and its crooked branches are half as\r\nlarge as its trunk\xe2\x80\x94all good, sound, hard wood, very like oak.\r\n\r\nWhen a party camps, the first thing to be done is to cut sage-brush; and\r\nin a few minutes there is an opulent pile of it ready for use. A hole a\r\nfoot wide, two feet deep, and two feet long, is dug, and sage-brush\r\nchopped up and burned in it till it is full to the brim with glowing\r\ncoals. Then the cooking begins, and there is no smoke, and consequently\r\nno swearing. Such a fire will keep all night, with very little\r\nreplenishing; and it makes a very sociable camp-fire, and one around\r\nwhich the most impossible reminiscences sound plausible, instructive,\r\nand profoundly entertaining.\r\n\r\nSage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished\r\nfailure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his\r\nillegitimate child the mule. But their testimony to its nutritiousness\r\nis worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or\r\nbrass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes\r\nhandy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters\r\nfor dinner. Mules and donkeys and camels have appetites that anything\r\nwill relieve temporarily, but nothing satisfy.\r\n\r\nIn Syria, once, at the head-waters of the Jordan, a camel took charge of\r\nmy overcoat while the tents were being pitched, and examined it with a\r\ncritical eye, all over, with as much interest as if he had an idea of\r\ngetting one made like it; and then, after he was done figuring on it as\r\nan article of apparel, he began to contemplate it as an article of diet.\r\nHe put his foot on it, and lifted one of the sleeves out with his teeth,\r\nand chewed and chewed at it, gradually taking it in, and all the while\r\nopening and closing his eyes in a kind of religious ecstasy, as if he\r\nhad never tasted anything as good as an overcoat before, in his life.\r\nThen he smacked his lips once or twice, and reached after the other\r\nsleeve. Next he tried the velvet collar, and smiled a smile of such\r\ncontentment that it was plain to see that he regarded that as the\r\ndaintiest thing about an overcoat. The tails went next, along with some\r\npercussion caps and cough candy, and some fig-paste from Constantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n035.jpg (95K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then my newspaper correspondence dropped out, and he took a chance\r\nin that\xe2\x80\x94manuscript letters written for the home papers. But he was\r\ntreading on dangerous ground, now. He began to come across solid wisdom\r\nin those documents that was rather weighty on his stomach; and\r\noccasionally he would take a joke that would shake him up till it\r\nloosened his teeth; it was getting to be perilous times with him, but he\r\nheld his grip with good courage and hopefully, till at last he began to\r\nstumble on statements that not even a camel could swallow with impunity.\r\nHe began to gag and gasp, and his eyes to stand out, and his forelegs to\r\nspread, and in about a quarter of a minute he fell over as stiff as a\r\ncarpenter\xe2\x80\x99s work-bench, and died a death of indescribable agony. I went\r\nand pulled the manuscript out of his mouth, and found that the sensitive\r\ncreature had choked to death on one of the mildest and gentlest\r\nstatements of fact that I ever laid before a trusting public.\r\n\r\nI was about to say, when diverted from my subject, that occasionally one\r\nfinds sage-bushes five or six feet high, and with a spread of branch and\r\nfoliage in proportion, but two or two and a half feet is the usual\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the sun went down and the evening chill came on, we made preparation\r\nfor bed. We stirred up the hard leather letter-sacks, and the knotty\r\ncanvas bags of printed matter (knotty and uneven because of projecting\r\nends and corners of magazines, boxes and books). We stirred them up and\r\nredisposed them in such a way as to make our bed as level as possible.\r\nAnd we _did_ improve it, too, though after all our work it had an\r\nupheaved and billowy look about it, like a little piece of a stormy sea.\r\nNext we hunted up our boots from odd nooks among the mail-bags where\r\nthey had settled, and put them on. Then we got down our coats, vests,\r\npantaloons and heavy woolen shirts, from the arm-loops where they had\r\nbeen swinging all day, and clothed ourselves in them\xe2\x80\x94for, there being no\r\nladies either at the stations or in the coach, and the weather being\r\nhot, we had looked to our comfort by stripping to our underclothing, at\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. All things being now ready, we stowed the\r\nuneasy Dictionary where it would lie as quiet as possible, and placed\r\nthe water-canteens and pistols where we could find them in the dark.\r\nThen we smoked a final pipe, and swapped a final yarn; after which, we\r\nput the pipes, tobacco and bag of coin in snug holes and caves among the\r\nmail-bags, and then fastened down the coach curtains all around, and\r\nmade the place as \xe2\x80\x9cdark as the inside of a cow,\xe2\x80\x9d as the conductor\r\nphrased it in his picturesque way. It was certainly as dark as any place\r\ncould be\xe2\x80\x94nothing was even dimly visible in it. And finally, we rolled\r\nourselves up like silk-worms, each person in his own blanket, and sank\r\npeacefully to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhenever the stage stopped to change horses, we would wake up, and try\r\nto recollect where we were\xe2\x80\x94and succeed\xe2\x80\x94and in a minute or two the stage\r\nwould be off again, and we likewise. We began to get into country, now,\r\nthreaded here and there with little streams. These had high, steep banks\r\non each side, and every time we flew down one bank and scrambled up the\r\nother, our party inside got mixed somewhat. First we would all be down\r\nin a pile at the forward end of the stage, nearly in a sitting posture,\r\nand in a second we would shoot to the other end, and stand on our heads.\r\nAnd we would sprawl and kick, too, and ward off ends and corners of\r\nmail- bags that came lumbering over us and about us; and as the dust\r\nrose from the tumult, we would all sneeze in chorus, and the majority of\r\nus would grumble, and probably say some hasty thing, like: \xe2\x80\x9cTake your\r\nelbow out of my ribs!\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t you quit crowding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery time we avalanched from one end of the stage to the other, the\r\nUnabridged Dictionary would come too; and every time it came it damaged\r\nsomebody. One trip it \xe2\x80\x9cbarked\xe2\x80\x9d the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s elbow; the next trip it\r\nhurt me in the stomach, and the third it tilted Bemis\xe2\x80\x99s nose up till he\r\ncould look down his nostrils\xe2\x80\x94he said. The pistols and coin soon settled\r\nto the bottom, but the pipes, pipe-stems, tobacco and canteens clattered\r\nand floundered after the Dictionary every time it made an assault on us,\r\nand aided and abetted the book by spilling tobacco in our eyes, and\r\nwater down our backs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n038.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, all things considered, it was a very comfortable night. It wore\r\ngradually away, and when at last a cold gray light was visible through\r\nthe puckers and chinks in the curtains, we yawned and stretched with\r\nsatisfaction, shed our cocoons, and felt that we had slept as much as\r\nwas necessary. By and by, as the sun rose up and warmed the world, we\r\npulled off our clothes and got ready for breakfast. We were just\r\npleasantly in time, for five minutes afterward the driver sent the weird\r\nmusic of his bugle winding over the grassy solitudes, and presently we\r\ndetected a low hut or two in the distance. Then the rattling of the\r\ncoach, the clatter of our six horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs, and the driver\xe2\x80\x99s crisp\r\ncommands, awoke to a louder and stronger emphasis, and we went sweeping\r\ndown on the station at our smartest speed. It was fascinating\xe2\x80\x94that old\r\noverland stagecoaching.\r\n\r\nWe jumped out in undress uniform. The driver tossed his gathered reins\r\nout on the ground, gaped and stretched complacently, drew off his heavy\r\nbuckskin gloves with great deliberation and insufferable dignity\xe2\x80\x94taking\r\nnot the slightest notice of a dozen solicitous inquires after his\r\nhealth, and humbly facetious and flattering accostings, and obsequious\r\ntenders of service, from five or six hairy and half-civilized station-\r\nkeepers and hostlers who were nimbly unhitching our steeds and bringing\r\nthe fresh team out of the stables\xe2\x80\x94for in the eyes of the stage-driver of\r\nthat day, station-keepers and hostlers were a sort of good enough low\r\ncreatures, useful in their place, and helping to make up a world, but\r\nnot the kind of beings which a person of distinction could afford to\r\nconcern himself with; while, on the contrary, in the eyes of the\r\nstation-keeper and the hostler, the stage-driver was a hero\xe2\x80\x94a great and\r\nshining dignitary, the world\xe2\x80\x99s favorite son, the envy of the people, the\r\nobserved of the nations. When they spoke to him they received his\r\ninsolent silence meekly, and as being the natural and proper conduct of\r\nso great a man; when he opened his lips they all hung on his words with\r\nadmiration (he never honored a particular individual with a remark, but\r\naddressed it with a broad generality to the horses, the stables, the\r\nsurrounding country _and_ the human underlings); when he discharged a\r\nfacetious insulting personality at a hostler, that hostler was happy for\r\nthe day; when he uttered his one jest\xe2\x80\x94old as the hills, coarse, profane,\r\nwitless, and inflicted on the same audience, in the same language, every\r\ntime his coach drove up there\xe2\x80\x94the varlets roared, and slapped their\r\nthighs, and swore it was the best thing they\xe2\x80\x99d ever heard in all their\r\nlives. And how they would fly around when he wanted a basin of water, a\r\ngourd of the same, or a light for his pipe!\xe2\x80\x94but they would instantly\r\ninsult a passenger if he so far forgot himself as to crave a favor at\r\ntheir hands. They could do that sort of insolence as well as the driver\r\nthey copied it from\xe2\x80\x94for, let it be borne in mind, the overland driver\r\nhad but little less contempt for his passengers than he had for his\r\nhostlers.\r\n\r\nThe hostlers and station-keepers treated the really powerful _conductor_\r\nof the coach merely with the best of what was their idea of civility,\r\nbut the _driver_ was the only being they bowed down to and worshipped.\r\nHow admiringly they would gaze up at him in his high seat as he gloved\r\nhimself with lingering deliberation, while some happy hostler held the\r\nbunch of reins aloft, and waited patiently for him to take it! And how\r\nthey would bombard him with glorifying ejaculations as he cracked his\r\nlong whip and went careering away.\r\n\r\nThe station buildings were long, low huts, made of sundried, mud-colored\r\nbricks, laid up without mortar (_adobes_, the Spaniards call these\r\nbricks, and Americans shorten it to \xe2\x80\x99_dobies_). The roofs, which had no\r\nslant to them worth speaking of, were thatched and then sodded or\r\ncovered with a thick layer of earth, and from this sprung a pretty rank\r\ngrowth of weeds and grass. It was the first time we had ever seen a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s front yard on top of his house. The building consisted of barns,\r\nstable-room for twelve or fifteen horses, and a hut for an eating-room\r\nfor passengers. This latter had bunks in it for the station-keeper and a\r\nhostler or two. You could rest your elbow on its eaves, and you had to\r\nbend in order to get in at the door. In place of a window there was a\r\nsquare hole about large enough for a man to crawl through, but this had\r\nno glass in it. There was no flooring, but the ground was packed hard.\r\nThere was no stove, but the fire-place served all needful purposes.\r\nThere were no shelves, no cupboards, no closets. In a corner stood an\r\nopen sack of flour, and nestling against its base were a couple of black\r\nand venerable tin coffee-pots, a tin teapot, a little bag of salt, and a\r\nside of bacon.\r\n\r\nBy the door of the station-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s den, outside, was a tin wash-basin,\r\non the ground. Near it was a pail of water and a piece of yellow bar\r\nsoap, and from the eaves hung a hoary blue woolen shirt,\r\nsignificantly\xe2\x80\x94but this latter was the station-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s private towel,\r\nand only two persons in all the party might venture to use it\xe2\x80\x94the stage-\r\ndriver and the conductor. The latter would not, from a sense of decency;\r\nthe former would not, because he did not choose to encourage the\r\nadvances of a station-keeper. We had towels\xe2\x80\x94in the valise; they might as\r\nwell have been in Sodom and Gomorrah. We (and the conductor) used our\r\nhandkerchiefs, and the driver his pantaloons and sleeves. By the door,\r\ninside, was fastened a small old-fashioned looking-glass frame, with two\r\nlittle fragments of the original mirror lodged down in one corner of it.\r\nThis arrangement afforded a pleasant double-barreled portrait of you\r\nwhen you looked into it, with one half of your head set up a couple of\r\ninches above the other half. From the glass frame hung the half of a\r\ncomb by a string\xe2\x80\x94but if I had to describe that patriarch or die, I\r\nbelieve I would order some sample coffins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n041.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n042a.jpg (11K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had come down from Esau and Samson, and had been accumulating hair\r\never since\xe2\x80\x94along with certain impurities. In one corner of the room\r\nstood three or four rifles and muskets, together with horns and pouches\r\nof ammunition. The station-men wore pantaloons of coarse, country-woven\r\nstuff, and into the seat and the inside of the legs were sewed ample\r\nadditions of buckskin, to do duty in place of leggings, when the man\r\nrode horseback\xe2\x80\x94so the pants were half dull blue and half yellow, and\r\nunspeakably picturesque. The pants were stuffed into the tops of high\r\nboots, the heels whereof were armed with great Spanish spurs, whose\r\nlittle iron clogs and chains jingled with every step. The man wore a\r\nhuge beard and mustachios, an old slouch hat, a blue woolen shirt, no\r\nsuspenders, no vest, no coat\xe2\x80\x94in a leathern sheath in his belt, a great\r\nlong \xe2\x80\x9cnavy\xe2\x80\x9d revolver (slung on right side, hammer to the front), and\r\nprojecting from his boot a horn-handled bowie-knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n042b.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe furniture of the hut was neither gorgeous nor much in the way. The\r\nrocking-chairs and sofas were not present, and never had been, but they\r\nwere represented by two three-legged stools, a pine-board bench four\r\nfeet long, and two empty candle-boxes. The table was a greasy board on\r\nstilts, and the table-cloth and napkins had not come\xe2\x80\x94and they were not\r\nlooking for them, either. A battered tin platter, a knife and fork, and\r\na tin pint cup, were at each man\xe2\x80\x99s place, and the driver had a queens-\r\nware saucer that had seen better days. Of course this duke sat at the\r\nhead of the table. There was one isolated piece of table furniture that\r\nbore about it a touching air of grandeur in misfortune. This was the\r\ncaster. It was German silver, and crippled and rusty, but it was so\r\npreposterously out of place there that it was suggestive of a tattered\r\nexiled king among barbarians, and the majesty of its native position\r\ncompelled respect even in its degradation.\r\n\r\nThere was only one cruet left, and that was a stopperless, fly-specked,\r\nbroken-necked thing, with two inches of vinegar in it, and a dozen\r\npreserved flies with their heels up and looking sorry they had invested\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n043.jpg (23K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe station-keeper upended a disk of last week\xe2\x80\x99s bread, of the shape and\r\nsize of an old-time cheese, and carved some slabs from it which were as\r\ngood as Nicholson pavement, and tenderer.\r\n\r\nHe sliced off a piece of bacon for each man, but only the experienced\r\nold hands made out to eat it, for it was condemned army bacon which the\r\nUnited States would not feed to its soldiers in the forts, and the stage\r\ncompany had bought it cheap for the sustenance of their passengers and\r\nemployees. We may have found this condemned army bacon further out on\r\nthe plains than the section I am locating it in, but we _found_ it\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nis no gainsaying that.\r\n\r\nThen he poured for us a beverage which he called \xe2\x80\x9cSlumgullion,\xe2\x80\x9d and it\r\nis hard to think he was not inspired when he named it. It really\r\npretended to be tea, but there was too much dish-rag, and sand, and old\r\nbacon-rind in it to deceive the intelligent traveler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n044.jpg (64K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had no sugar and no milk\xe2\x80\x94not even a spoon to stir the ingredients\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nWe could not eat the bread or the meat, nor drink the \xe2\x80\x9cslumgullion.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nwhen I looked at that melancholy vinegar-cruet, I thought of the\r\nanecdote (a very, very old one, even at that day) of the traveler who\r\nsat down to a table which had nothing on it but a mackerel and a pot of\r\nmustard. He asked the landlord if this was all. The landlord said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_All_! Why, thunder and lightning, I should think there was mackerel\r\nenough there for six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t like mackerel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94then help yourself to the mustard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn other days I had considered it a good, a very good, anecdote, but\r\nthere was a dismal plausibility about it, here, that took all the humor\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nOur breakfast was before us, but our teeth were idle.\r\n\r\nI tasted and smelt, and said I would take coffee, I believed. The\r\nstation-boss stopped dead still, and glared at me speechless. At last,\r\nwhen he came to, he turned away and said, as one who communes with\r\nhimself upon a matter too vast to grasp:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Coffee_! Well, if that don\xe2\x80\x99t go clean ahead of me, I\xe2\x80\x99m d\xe2\x80\x94-d!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n045.jpg (40K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could not eat, and there was no conversation among the hostlers and\r\nherdsmen\xe2\x80\x94we all sat at the same board. At least there was no\r\nconversation further than a single hurried request, now and then, from\r\none employee to another. It was always in the same form, and always\r\ngruffly friendly. Its western freshness and novelty startled me, at\r\nfirst, and interested me; but it presently grew monotonous, and lost its\r\ncharm. It was:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPass the bread, you son of a skunk!\xe2\x80\x9d No, I forget\xe2\x80\x94skunk was not the\r\nword; it seems to me it was still stronger than that; I know it was, in\r\nfact, but it is gone from my memory, apparently. However, it is no\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94probably it was too strong for print, anyway. It is the landmark\r\nin my memory which tells me where I first encountered the vigorous new\r\nvernacular of the occidental plains and mountains.\r\n\r\nWe gave up the breakfast, and paid our dollar apiece and went back to\r\nour mail-bag bed in the coach, and found comfort in our pipes. Right\r\nhere we suffered the first diminution of our princely state. We left our\r\nsix fine horses and took six mules in their place. But they were wild\r\nMexican fellows, and a man had to stand at the head of each of them and\r\nhold him fast while the driver gloved and got himself ready. And when at\r\nlast he grasped the reins and gave the word, the men sprung suddenly\r\naway from the mules\xe2\x80\x99 heads and the coach shot from the station as if it\r\nhad issued from a cannon. How the frantic animals did scamper! It was a\r\nfierce and furious gallop\xe2\x80\x94and the gait never altered for a moment till\r\nwe reeled off ten or twelve miles and swept up to the next collection of\r\nlittle station-huts and stables.\r\n\r\nSo we flew along all day. At 2 P.M. the belt of timber that fringes the\r\nNorth Platte and marks its windings through the vast level floor of the\r\nPlains came in sight. At 4 P.M. we crossed a branch of the river, and at\r\n5 P.M. we crossed the Platte itself, and landed at Fort Kearney, fifty-\r\nsix hours out from _St. Joe_\xe2\x80\x94THREE HUNDRED MILES!\r\n\r\nNow that was stage-coaching on the great overland, ten or twelve years\r\nago, when perhaps not more than ten men in America, all told, expected\r\nto live to see a railroad follow that route to the Pacific. But the\r\nrailroad is there, now, and it pictures a thousand odd comparisons and\r\ncontrasts in my mind to read the following sketch, in the New York\r\nTimes, of a recent trip over almost the very ground I have been\r\ndescribing. I can scarcely comprehend the new state of things:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cACROSS THE CONTINENT.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt 4.20 P.M., Sunday, we rolled out of the station at Omaha, and\r\nstarted westward on our long jaunt. A couple of hours out, dinner was\r\nannounced\xe2\x80\x94an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d to those of us who had yet to experience what it is\r\nto eat in one of Pullman\xe2\x80\x99s hotels on wheels; so, stepping into the car\r\nnext forward of our sleeping palace, we found ourselves in the dining-\r\ncar. It was a revelation to us, that first dinner on Sunday. And though\r\nwe continued to dine for four days, and had as many breakfasts and\r\nsuppers, our whole party never ceased to admire the perfection of the\r\narrangements, and the marvelous results achieved. Upon tables covered\r\nwith snowy linen, and garnished with services of solid silver, Ethiop\r\nwaiters, flitting about in spotless white, placed as by magic a repast\r\nat which Delmonico himself could have had no occasion to blush; and,\r\nindeed, in some respects it would be hard for that distinguished chef to\r\nmatch our menu; for, in addition to all that ordinarily makes up a\r\nfirst-chop dinner, had we not our antelope steak (the gormand who has\r\nnot experienced this\xe2\x80\x94bah! what does he know of the feast of fat things?)\r\nour delicious mountain-brook trout, and choice fruits and berries, and\r\n(sauce piquant and unpurchasable!) our sweet-scented, appetite-\r\ncompelling air of the prairies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n047.jpg (88K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may depend upon it, we all did justice to the good things, and as\r\nwe washed them down with bumpers of sparkling Krug, whilst we sped along\r\nat the rate of thirty miles an hour, agreed it was the fastest living we\r\nhad ever experienced. (We beat that, however, two days afterward when we\r\nmade twenty-seven miles in twenty-seven minutes, while our Champagne\r\nglasses filled to the brim spilled not a drop!) After dinner we repaired\r\nto our drawing-room car, and, as it was Sabbath eve, intoned some of the\r\ngrand old hymns\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPraise God from whom,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.; \xe2\x80\x9cShining Shore,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoronation,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\xe2\x80\x94the voices of the men singers and of the women\r\nsingers blending sweetly in the evening air, while our train, with its\r\ngreat, glaring Polyphemus eye, lighting up long vistas of prairie,\r\nrushed into the night and the Wild. Then to bed in luxurious couches,\r\nwhere we slept the sleep of the just and only awoke the next morning\r\n(Monday) at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, to find ourselves at the crossing of the\r\nNorth Platte, three hundred miles from Omaha\xe2\x80\x94fifteen hours and forty\r\nminutes out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother night of alternate tranquillity and turmoil. But morning came,\r\nby and by. It was another glad awakening to fresh breezes, vast expanses\r\nof level greensward, bright sunlight, an impressive solitude utterly\r\nwithout visible human beings or human habitations, and an atmosphere of\r\nsuch amazing magnifying properties that trees that seemed close at hand\r\nwere more than three mile away. We resumed undress uniform, climbed a-\r\ntop of the flying coach, dangled our legs over the side, shouted\r\noccasionally at our frantic mules, merely to see them lay their ears\r\nback and scamper faster, tied our hats on to keep our hair from blowing\r\naway, and leveled an outlook over the world-wide carpet about us for\r\nthings new and strange to gaze at. Even at this day it thrills me\r\nthrough and through to think of the life, the gladness and the wild\r\nsense of freedom that used to make the blood dance in my veins on those\r\nfine overland mornings!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n049.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n050.jpg (51K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong about an hour after breakfast we saw the first prairie-dog\r\nvillages, the first antelope, and the first wolf. If I remember rightly,\r\nthis latter was the regular _cayote_ (pronounced ky-_o_-te) of the\r\nfarther deserts. And if it _was_, he was not a pretty creature or\r\nrespectable either, for I got well acquainted with his race afterward,\r\nand can speak with confidence. The cayote is a long, slim, sick and\r\nsorry-looking skeleton, with a gray wolf-skin stretched over it, a\r\ntolerably bushy tail that forever sags down with a despairing expression\r\nof forsakenness and misery, a furtive and evil eye, and a long, sharp\r\nface, with slightly lifted lip and exposed teeth. He has a general\r\nslinking expression all over. The cayote is a living, breathing allegory\r\nof Want. He is _always_ hungry.\r\n\r\nHe is always poor, out of luck and friendless. The meanest creatures\r\ndespise him, and even the fleas would desert him for a velocipede. He is\r\nso spiritless and cowardly that even while his exposed teeth are\r\npretending a threat, the rest of his face is apologizing for it. And he\r\nis so _homely_!\xe2\x80\x94so scrawny, and ribby, and coarse-haired, and pitiful.\r\nWhen he sees you he lifts his lip and lets a flash of his teeth out, and\r\nthen turns a little out of the course he was pursuing, depresses his\r\nhead a bit, and strikes a long, soft-footed trot through the sage-brush,\r\nglancing over his shoulder at you, from time to time, till he is about\r\nout of easy pistol range, and then he stops and takes a deliberate\r\nsurvey of you; he will trot fifty yards and stop again\xe2\x80\x94another fifty and\r\nstop again; and finally the gray of his gliding body blends with the\r\ngray of the sage-brush, and he disappears. All this is when you make no\r\ndemonstration against him; but if you do, he develops a livelier\r\ninterest in his journey, and instantly electrifies his heels and puts\r\nsuch a deal of real estate between himself and your weapon, that by the\r\ntime you have raised the hammer you see that you need a minie rifle, and\r\nby the time you have got him in line you need a rifled cannon, and by\r\nthe time you have \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn a bead\xe2\x80\x9d on him you see well enough that nothing\r\nbut an unusually long-winded streak of lightning could reach him where\r\nhe is now. But if you start a swift-footed dog after him, you will enjoy\r\nit ever so much\xe2\x80\x94especially if it is a dog that has a good opinion of\r\nhimself, and has been brought up to think he knows something about\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n051.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cayote will go swinging gently off on that deceitful trot of his,\r\nand every little while he will smile a fraudful smile over his shoulder\r\nthat will fill that dog entirely full of encouragement and worldly\r\nambition, and make him lay his head still lower to the ground, and\r\nstretch his neck further to the front, and pant more fiercely, and stick\r\nhis tail out straighter behind, and move his furious legs with a yet\r\nwilder frenzy, and leave a broader and broader, and higher and denser\r\ncloud of desert sand smoking behind, and marking his long wake across\r\nthe level plain! And all this time the dog is only a short twenty feet\r\nbehind the cayote, and to save the soul of him he cannot understand why\r\nit is that he cannot get perceptibly closer; and he begins to get\r\naggravated, and it makes him madder and madder to see how gently the\r\ncayote glides along and never pants or sweats or ceases to smile; and he\r\ngrows still more and more incensed to see how shamefully he has been\r\ntaken in by an entire stranger, and what an ignoble swindle that long,\r\ncalm, soft-footed trot is; and next he notices that he is getting\r\nfagged, and that the cayote actually has to slacken speed a little to\r\nkeep from running away from him\xe2\x80\x94and _then_ that town-dog is mad in\r\nearnest, and he begins to strain and weep and swear, and paw the sand\r\nhigher than ever, and reach for the cayote with concentrated and\r\ndesperate energy. This \xe2\x80\x9cspurt\xe2\x80\x9d finds him six feet behind the gliding\r\nenemy, and two miles from his friends. And then, in the instant that a\r\nwild new hope is lighting up his face, the cayote turns and smiles\r\nblandly upon him once more, and with a something about it which seems to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I shall have to tear myself away from you, bub\xe2\x80\x94business is\r\nbusiness, and it will not do for me to be fooling along this way all\r\nday\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and forthwith there is a rushing sound, and the sudden splitting of\r\na long crack through the atmosphere, and behold that dog is solitary and\r\nalone in the midst of a vast solitude!\r\n\r\nIt makes his head swim. He stops, and looks all around; climbs the\r\nnearest sand-mound, and gazes into the distance; shakes his head\r\nreflectively, and then, without a word, he turns and jogs along back to\r\nhis train, and takes up a humble position under the hindmost wagon, and\r\nfeels unspeakably mean, and looks ashamed, and hangs his tail at half-\r\nmast for a week. And for as much as a year after that, whenever there is\r\na great hue and cry after a cayote, that dog will merely glance in that\r\ndirection without emotion, and apparently observe to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe\r\nI do not wish any of the pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n052.jpg (145K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cayote lives chiefly in the most desolate and forbidding desert,\r\nalong with the lizard, the jackass-rabbit and the raven, and gets an\r\nuncertain and precarious living, and earns it. He seems to subsist\r\nalmost wholly on the carcases of oxen, mules and horses that have\r\ndropped out of emigrant trains and died, and upon windfalls of carrion,\r\nand occasional legacies of offal bequeathed to him by white men who have\r\nbeen opulent enough to have something better to butcher than condemned\r\narmy bacon.\r\n\r\nHe will eat anything in the world that his first cousins, the desert-\r\nfrequenting tribes of Indians will, and they will eat anything they can\r\nbite. It is a curious fact that these latter are the only creatures\r\nknown to history who will eat nitro-glycerine and ask for more if they\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\nThe cayote of the deserts beyond the Rocky Mountains has a peculiarly\r\nhard time of it, owing to the fact that his relations, the Indians, are\r\njust as apt to be the first to detect a seductive scent on the desert\r\nbreeze, and follow the fragrance to the late ox it emanated from, as he\r\nis himself; and when this occurs he has to content himself with sitting\r\noff at a little distance watching those people strip off and dig out\r\neverything edible, and walk off with it. Then he and the waiting ravens\r\nexplore the skeleton and polish the bones. It is considered that the\r\ncayote, and the obscene bird, and the Indian of the desert, testify\r\ntheir blood kinship with each other in that they live together in the\r\nwaste places of the earth on terms of perfect confidence and friendship,\r\nwhile hating all other creature and yearning to assist at their\r\nfunerals. He does not mind going a hundred miles to breakfast, and a\r\nhundred and fifty to dinner, because he is sure to have three or four\r\ndays between meals, and he can just as well be traveling and looking at\r\nthe scenery as lying around doing nothing and adding to the burdens of\r\nhis parents.\r\n\r\nWe soon learned to recognize the sharp, vicious bark of the cayote as it\r\ncame across the murky plain at night to disturb our dreams among the\r\nmail-sacks; and remembering his forlorn aspect and his hard fortune,\r\nmade shift to wish him the blessed novelty of a long day\xe2\x80\x99s good luck and\r\na limitless larder the morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur new conductor (just shipped) had been without sleep for twenty\r\nhours. Such a thing was very frequent. From St. Joseph, Missouri, to\r\nSacramento, California, by stage-coach, was nearly nineteen hundred\r\nmiles, and the trip was often made in fifteen days (the cars do it in\r\nfour and a half, now), but the time specified in the mail contracts, and\r\nrequired by the schedule, was eighteen or nineteen days, if I remember\r\nrightly. This was to make fair allowance for winter storms and snows,\r\nand other unavoidable causes of detention. The stage company had\r\neverything under strict discipline and good system. Over each two\r\nhundred and fifty miles of road they placed an agent or superintendent,\r\nand invested him with great authority. His beat or jurisdiction of two\r\nhundred and fifty miles was called a \xe2\x80\x9cdivision.\xe2\x80\x9d He purchased horses,\r\nmules harness, and food for men and beasts, and distributed these things\r\namong his stage stations, from time to time, according to his judgment\r\nof what each station needed. He erected station buildings and dug wells.\r\nHe attended to the paying of the station-keepers, hostlers, drivers and\r\nblacksmiths, and discharged them whenever he chose. He was a very, very\r\ngreat man in his \xe2\x80\x9cdivision\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a kind of Grand Mogul, a Sultan of the\r\nIndies, in whose presence common men were modest of speech and manner,\r\nand in the glare of whose greatness even the dazzling stage-driver\r\ndwindled to a penny dip. There were about eight of these kings, all\r\ntold, on the overland route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n055.jpg (39K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in rank and importance to the division-agent came the \xe2\x80\x9cconductor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nHis beat was the same length as the agent\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94two hundred and fifty miles.\r\nHe sat with the driver, and (when necessary) rode that fearful distance,\r\nnight and day, without other rest or sleep than what he could get\r\nperched thus on top of the flying vehicle. Think of it! He had absolute\r\ncharge of the mails, express matter, passengers and stage-coach, until\r\nhe delivered them to the next conductor, and got his receipt for them.\r\n\r\nConsequently he had to be a man of intelligence, decision and\r\nconsiderable executive ability. He was usually a quiet, pleasant man,\r\nwho attended closely to his duties, and was a good deal of a gentleman.\r\nIt was not absolutely necessary that the division-agent should be a\r\ngentleman, and occasionally he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. But he was always a general in\r\nadministrative ability, and a bull-dog in courage and\r\ndetermination\xe2\x80\x94otherwise the chieftainship over the lawless underlings of\r\nthe overland service would never in any instance have been to him\r\nanything but an equivalent for a month of insolence and distress and a\r\nbullet and a coffin at the end of it. There were about sixteen or\r\neighteen conductors on the overland, for there was a daily stage each\r\nway, and a conductor on every stage.\r\n\r\nNext in _real_ and official rank and importance, _after_ the conductor,\r\ncame my delight, the driver\xe2\x80\x94next in real but not in _apparent_\r\nimportance\xe2\x80\x94for we have seen that in the eyes of the common herd the\r\ndriver was to the conductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flag-\r\nship. The driver\xe2\x80\x99s beat was pretty long, and his sleeping-time at the\r\nstations pretty short, sometimes; and so, but for the grandeur of his\r\nposition his would have been a sorry life, as well as a hard and a\r\nwearing one. We took a new driver every day or every night (for they\r\ndrove backward and forward over the same piece of road all the time),\r\nand therefore we never got as well acquainted with them as we did with\r\nthe conductors; and besides, they would have been above being familiar\r\nwith such rubbish as passengers, anyhow, as a general thing. Still, we\r\nwere always eager to get a sight of each and every new driver as soon as\r\nthe watch changed, for each and every day we were either anxious to get\r\nrid of an unpleasant one, or loath to part with a driver we had learned\r\nto like and had come to be sociable and friendly with. And so the first\r\nquestion we asked the conductor whenever we got to where we were to\r\nexchange drivers, was always, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is him?\xe2\x80\x9d The grammar was faulty,\r\nmaybe, but we could not know, then, that it would go into a book some\r\nday. As long as everything went smoothly, the overland driver was well\r\nenough situated, but if a fellow driver got sick suddenly it made\r\ntrouble, for the coach _must_ go on, and so the potentate who was about\r\nto climb down and take a luxurious rest after his long night\xe2\x80\x99s siege in\r\nthe midst of wind and rain and darkness, had to stay where he was and do\r\nthe sick man\xe2\x80\x99s work. Once, in the Rocky Mountains, when I found a driver\r\nsound asleep on the box, and the mules going at the usual break-neck\r\npace, the conductor said never mind him, there was no danger, and he was\r\ndoing double duty\xe2\x80\x94had driven seventy-five miles on one coach, and was\r\nnow going back over it on this without rest or sleep. A hundred and\r\nfifty miles of holding back of six vindictive mules and keeping them\r\nfrom climbing the trees! It sounds incredible, but I remember the\r\nstatement well enough.\r\n\r\nThe station-keepers, hostlers, etc., were low, rough characters, as\r\nalready described; and from western Nebraska to Nevada a considerable\r\nsprinkling of them might be fairly set down as outlaws\xe2\x80\x94fugitives from\r\njustice, criminals whose best security was a section of country which\r\nwas without law and without even the pretence of it. When the \xe2\x80\x9cdivision-\r\nagent\xe2\x80\x9d issued an order to one of these parties he did it with the full\r\nunderstanding that he might have to enforce it with a navy six-shooter,\r\nand so he always went \xe2\x80\x9cfixed\xe2\x80\x9d to make things go along smoothly.\r\n\r\nNow and then a division-agent was really obliged to shoot a hostler\r\nthrough the head to teach him some simple matter that he could have\r\ntaught him with a club if his circumstances and surroundings had been\r\ndifferent. But they were snappy, able men, those division-agents, and\r\nwhen they tried to teach a subordinate anything, that subordinate\r\ngenerally \xe2\x80\x9cgot it through his head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n057.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA great portion of this vast machinery\xe2\x80\x94these hundreds of men and\r\ncoaches, and thousands of mules and horses\xe2\x80\x94was in the hands of Mr. Ben\r\nHolliday. All the western half of the business was in his hands. This\r\nreminds me of an incident of Palestine travel which is pertinent here,\r\nso I will transfer it just in the language in which I find it set down\r\nin my Holy Land note-book:\r\n\r\nNo doubt everybody has heard of Ben Holliday\xe2\x80\x94a man of prodigious energy,\r\nwho used to send mails and passengers flying across the continent in his\r\noverland stage-coaches like a very whirlwind\xe2\x80\x94two thousand long miles in\r\nfifteen days and a half, by the watch! But this fragment of history is\r\nnot about Ben Holliday, but about a young New York boy by the name of\r\nJack, who traveled with our small party of pilgrims in the Holy Land\r\n(and who had traveled to California in Mr. Holliday\xe2\x80\x99s overland coaches\r\nthree years before, and had by no means forgotten it or lost his gushing\r\nadmiration of Mr. H.) Aged nineteen. Jack was a good boy\xe2\x80\x94a good-hearted\r\nand always well-meaning boy, who had been reared in the city of New\r\nYork, and although he was bright and knew a great many useful things,\r\nhis Scriptural education had been a good deal neglected\xe2\x80\x94to such a\r\ndegree, indeed, that all Holy Land history was fresh and new to him, and\r\nall Bible names mysteries that had never disturbed his virgin ear.\r\n\r\nAlso in our party was an elderly pilgrim who was the reverse of Jack, in\r\nthat he was learned in the Scriptures and an enthusiast concerning them.\r\nHe was our encyclopedia, and we were never tired of listening to his\r\nspeeches, nor he of making them. He never passed a celebrated locality,\r\nfrom Bashan to Bethlehem, without illuminating it with an oration. One\r\nday, when camped near the ruins of Jericho, he burst forth with\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJack, do you see that range of mountains over yonder that bounds the\r\nJordan valley? The mountains of Moab, Jack! Think of it, my boy\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nactual mountains of Moab\xe2\x80\x94renowned in Scripture history! We are actually\r\nstanding face to face with those illustrious crags and peaks\xe2\x80\x94and for all\r\nwe know\xe2\x80\x9d [dropping his voice impressively], \xe2\x80\x9cour eyes may be resting at\r\nthis very moment upon the spot WHERE LIES THE MYSTERIOUS GRAVE OF MOSES!\r\nThink of it, Jack!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoses who?\xe2\x80\x9d (falling inflection).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n058.jpg (62K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoses who! Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself\xe2\x80\x94you ought to be\r\nashamed of such criminal ignorance. Why, Moses, the great guide,\r\nsoldier, poet, lawgiver of ancient Israel! Jack, from this spot where we\r\nstand, to Egypt, stretches a fearful desert three hundred miles in\r\nextent\xe2\x80\x94and across that desert that wonderful man brought the children of\r\nIsrael!\xe2\x80\x94guiding them with unfailing sagacity for forty years over the\r\nsandy desolation and among the obstructing rocks and hills, and landed\r\nthem at last, safe and sound, within sight of this very spot; and where\r\nwe now stand they entered the Promised Land with anthems of rejoicing!\r\nIt was a wonderful, wonderful thing to do, Jack! Think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForty years? Only three hundred miles? Humph! Ben Holliday would have\r\nfetched them through in thirty-six hours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe boy meant no harm. He did not know that he had said anything that\r\nwas wrong or irreverent. And so no one scolded him or felt offended with\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94and nobody could but some ungenerous spirit incapable of excusing\r\nthe heedless blunders of a boy.\r\n\r\nAt noon on the fifth day out, we arrived at the \xe2\x80\x9cCrossing of the South\r\nPlatte,\xe2\x80\x9d _alias_ \xe2\x80\x9cJulesburg,\xe2\x80\x9d _alias_ \xe2\x80\x9cOverland City,\xe2\x80\x9d four hundred and\r\nseventy miles from St. Joseph\xe2\x80\x94the strangest, quaintest, funniest\r\nfrontier town that our untraveled eyes had ever stared at and been\r\nastonished with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt did seem strange enough to see a town again after what appeared to us\r\nsuch a long acquaintance with deep, still, almost lifeless and houseless\r\nsolitude! We tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoric\r\npeople crumbled off the corner of some other world, and wakened up\r\nsuddenly in this. For an hour we took as much interest in Overland City\r\nas if we had never seen a town before. The reason we had an hour to\r\nspare was because we had to change our stage (for a less sumptuous\r\naffair, called a \xe2\x80\x9cmud-wagon\xe2\x80\x9d) and transfer our freight of mails.\r\n\r\nPresently we got under way again. We came to the shallow, yellow, muddy\r\nSouth Platte, with its low banks and its scattering flat sand-bars and\r\npigmy islands\xe2\x80\x94a melancholy stream straggling through the centre of the\r\nenormous flat plain, and only saved from being impossible to find with\r\nthe naked eye by its sentinel rank of scattering trees standing on\r\neither bank. The Platte was \xe2\x80\x9cup,\xe2\x80\x9d they said\xe2\x80\x94which made me wish I could\r\nsee it when it was down, if it could look any sicker and sorrier. They\r\nsaid it was a dangerous stream to cross, now, because its quicksands\r\nwere liable to swallow up horses, coach and passengers if an attempt was\r\nmade to ford it. But the mails had to go, and we made the attempt. Once\r\nor twice in midstream the wheels sunk into the yielding sands so\r\nthreateningly that we half believed we had dreaded and avoided the sea\r\nall our lives to be shipwrecked in a \xe2\x80\x9cmud-wagon\xe2\x80\x9d in the middle of a\r\ndesert at last. But we dragged through and sped away toward the setting\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n061.jpg (69K)\r\n\r\nNext morning, just before dawn, when about five hundred and fifty miles\r\nfrom St. Joseph, our mud-wagon broke down. We were to be delayed five or\r\nsix hours, and therefore we took horses, by invitation, and joined a\r\nparty who were just starting on a buffalo hunt. It was noble sport\r\ngalloping over the plain in the dewy freshness of the morning, but our\r\npart of the hunt ended in disaster and disgrace, for a wounded buffalo\r\nbull chased the passenger Bemis nearly two miles, and then he forsook\r\nhis horse and took to a lone tree. He was very sullen about the matter\r\nfor some twenty-four hours, but at last he began to soften little by\r\nlittle, and finally he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n062.jpg (81K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it was not funny, and there was no sense in those gawks making\r\nthemselves so facetious over it. I tell you I was angry in earnest for\r\nawhile. I should have shot that long gangly lubber they called Hank, if\r\nI could have done it without crippling six or seven other people\xe2\x80\x94but of\r\ncourse I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, the old \xe2\x80\x98Allen\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 so confounded comprehensive. I wish\r\nthose loafers had been up in the tree; they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have wanted to\r\nlaugh so. If I had had a horse worth a cent\xe2\x80\x94but no, the minute he saw\r\nthat buffalo bull wheel on him and give a bellow, he raised straight up\r\nin the air and stood on his heels. The saddle began to slip, and I took\r\nhim round the neck and laid close to him, and began to pray. Then he\r\ncame down and stood up on the other end awhile, and the bull actually\r\nstopped pawing sand and bellowing to contemplate the inhuman spectacle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the bull made a pass at him and uttered a bellow that sounded\r\nperfectly frightful, it was so close to me, and that seemed to literally\r\nprostrate my horse\xe2\x80\x99s reason, and make a raving distracted maniac of him,\r\nand I wish I may die if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand on his head for a quarter of a\r\nminute and shed tears. He was absolutely out of his mind\xe2\x80\x94he was, as sure\r\nas truth itself, and he really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he was doing. Then the\r\nbull came charging at us, and my horse dropped down on all fours and\r\ntook a fresh start\xe2\x80\x94and then for the next ten minutes he would actually\r\nthrow one hand-spring after another so fast that the bull began to get\r\nunsettled, too, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to start in\xe2\x80\x94and so he stood there\r\nsneezing, and shovelling dust over his back, and bellowing every now and\r\nthen, and thinking he had got a fifteen-hundred dollar circus horse for\r\nbreakfast, certain. Well, I was first out on his neck\xe2\x80\x94the horse\xe2\x80\x99s, not\r\nthe bull\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and then underneath, and next on his rump, and sometimes head\r\nup, and sometimes heels\xe2\x80\x94but I tell you it seemed solemn and awful to be\r\nripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death, as you\r\nmight say. Pretty soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought away\r\nsome of my horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail (I suppose, but do not know, being pretty busy\r\nat the time), but _something_ made him hungry for solitude and suggested\r\nto him to get up and hunt for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n063.jpg (63K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you ought to have seen that spider legged old skeleton go! and\r\nyou ought to have seen the bull cut out after him, too\xe2\x80\x94head down, tongue\r\nout, tail up, bellowing like everything, and actually mowing down the\r\nweeds, and tearing up the earth, and boosting up the sand like a\r\nwhirlwind! By George, it was a hot race! I and the saddle were back on\r\nthe rump, and I had the bridle in my teeth and holding on to the pommel\r\nwith both hands. First we left the dogs behind; then we passed a jackass\r\nrabbit; then we overtook a cayote, and were gaining on an antelope when\r\nthe rotten girth let go and threw me about thirty yards off to the left,\r\nand as the saddle went down over the horse\xe2\x80\x99s rump he gave it a lift with\r\nhis heels that sent it more than four hundred yards up in the air, I\r\nwish I may die in a minute if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I fell at the foot of the only\r\nsolitary tree there was in nine counties adjacent (as any creature could\r\nsee with the naked eye), and the next second I had hold of the bark with\r\nfour sets of nails and my teeth, and the next second after that I was\r\nastraddle of the main limb and blaspheming my luck in a way that made my\r\nbreath smell of brimstone. I _had_ the bull, now, if he did not think of\r\none thing. But that one thing I dreaded. I dreaded it very seriously.\r\nThere was a possibility that the bull might not think of it, but there\r\nwere greater chances that he would. I made up my mind what I would do in\r\ncase he did. It was a little over forty feet to the ground from where I\r\nsat. I cautiously unwound the lariat from the pommel of my saddle\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour _saddle_? Did you take your saddle up in the tree with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it up in the tree with me? Why, how you talk. Of course I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nNo man could do that. It _fell_ in the tree when it came down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh\xe2\x80\x94exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. I unwound the lariat, and fastened one end of it to the\r\nlimb. It was the very best green raw-hide, and capable of sustaining\r\ntons. I made a slip-noose in the other end, and then hung it down to see\r\nthe length. It reached down twenty-two feet\xe2\x80\x94half way to the ground. I\r\nthen loaded every barrel of the Allen with a double charge. I felt\r\nsatisfied. I said to myself, if he never thinks of that _one_ thing that\r\nI dread, all right\xe2\x80\x94but if he does, all right anyhow\xe2\x80\x94I am fixed for him.\r\nBut don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that the very thing a man dreads is the thing that\r\nalways happens? Indeed it is so. I watched the bull, now, with\r\nanxiety\xe2\x80\x94anxiety which no one can conceive of who has not been in such a\r\nsituation and felt that at any moment death might come. Presently a\r\nthought came into the bull\xe2\x80\x99s eye. I knew it! said I\xe2\x80\x94if my nerve fails\r\nnow, I am lost. Sure enough, it was just as I had dreaded, he started in\r\nto climb the tree\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, the bull?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course\xe2\x80\x94who else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut a bull can\xe2\x80\x99t climb a tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n065.jpg (75K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t, can\xe2\x80\x99t he? Since you know so much about it, did you ever see a\r\nbull try?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I never dreamt of such a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what is the use of your talking that way, then? Because you\r\nnever saw a thing done, is that any reason why it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right\xe2\x80\x94go on. What did you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe bull started up, and got along well for about ten feet, then\r\nslipped and slid back. I breathed easier. He tried it again\xe2\x80\x94got up a\r\nlittle higher\xe2\x80\x94slipped again. But he came at it once more, and this time\r\nhe was careful. He got gradually higher and higher, and my spirits went\r\ndown more and more. Up he came\xe2\x80\x94an inch at a time\xe2\x80\x94with his eyes hot, and\r\nhis tongue hanging out. Higher and higher\xe2\x80\x94hitched his foot over the\r\nstump of a limb, and looked up, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98You are my meat,\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x99 Up again\xe2\x80\x94higher and higher, and getting more excited the closer\r\nhe got. He was within ten feet of me! I took a long breath,\xe2\x80\x94and then\r\nsaid I, \xe2\x80\x98It is now or never.\xe2\x80\x99 I had the coil of the lariat all ready; I\r\npaid it out slowly, till it hung right over his head; all of a sudden I\r\nlet go of the slack, and the slipnoose fell fairly round his neck!\r\nQuicker than lightning I out with the Allen and let him have it in the\r\nface. It was an awful roar, and must have scared the bull out of his\r\nsenses. When the smoke cleared away, there he was, dangling in the air,\r\ntwenty foot from the ground, and going out of one convulsion into\r\nanother faster than you could count! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop to count, anyhow\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nshinned down the tree and shot for home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBemis, is all that true, just as you have stated it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I may rot in my tracks and die the death of a dog if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we can\xe2\x80\x99t refuse to believe it, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t. But if there were\r\nsome proofs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProofs! Did I bring back my lariat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I bring back my horse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see the bull again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, what more do you want? I never saw anybody as particular as\r\nyou are about a little thing like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made up my mind that if this man was not a liar he only missed it by\r\nthe skin of his teeth. This episode reminds me of an incident of my\r\nbrief sojourn in Siam, years afterward. The European citizens of a town\r\nin the neighborhood of Bangkok had a prodigy among them by the name of\r\nEckert, an Englishman\xe2\x80\x94a person famous for the number, ingenuity and\r\nimposing magnitude of his lies. They were always repeating his most\r\ncelebrated falsehoods, and always trying to \xe2\x80\x9cdraw him out\xe2\x80\x9d before\r\nstrangers; but they seldom succeeded. Twice he was invited to the house\r\nwhere I was visiting, but nothing could seduce him into a specimen lie.\r\nOne day a planter named Bascom, an influential man, and a proud and\r\nsometimes irascible one, invited me to ride over with him and call on\r\nEckert. As we jogged along, said he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, do you know where the fault lies? It lies in putting Eckert on his\r\nguard. The minute the boys go to pumping at Eckert he knows perfectly\r\nwell what they are after, and of course he shuts up his shell. Anybody\r\nmight know he would. But when we get there, we must play him finer than\r\nthat. Let him shape the conversation to suit himself\xe2\x80\x94let him drop it or\r\nchange it whenever he wants to. Let him see that nobody is trying to\r\ndraw him out. Just let him have his own way. He will soon forget himself\r\nand begin to grind out lies like a mill. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get impatient\xe2\x80\x94just keep\r\nquiet, and let me play him. I will make him lie. It does seem to me that\r\nthe boys must be blind to overlook such an obvious and simple trick as\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEckert received us heartily\xe2\x80\x94a pleasant-spoken, gentle-mannered creature.\r\nWe sat in the veranda an hour, sipping English ale, and talking about\r\nthe king, and the sacred white elephant, the Sleeping Idol, and all\r\nmanner of things; and I noticed that my comrade never led the\r\nconversation himself or shaped it, but simply followed Eckert\xe2\x80\x99s lead,\r\nand betrayed no solicitude and no anxiety about anything. The effect was\r\nshortly perceptible. Eckert began to grow communicative; he grew more\r\nand more at his ease, and more and more talkative and sociable. Another\r\nhour passed in the same way, and then all of a sudden Eckert said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, by the way! I came near forgetting. I have got a thing here to\r\nastonish you. Such a thing as neither you nor any other man ever heard\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a cat that will eat cocoanut! Common green cocoanut\xe2\x80\x94and not\r\nonly eat the meat, but drink the milk. It is so\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA quick glance from Bascom\xe2\x80\x94a glance that I understood\xe2\x80\x94then:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, bless my soul, I never heard of such a thing. Man, it is\r\nimpossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would say it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll fetch the cat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe went in the house. Bascom said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94what did I tell you? Now, that is the way to handle Eckert. You\r\nsee, I have petted him along patiently, and put his suspicions to sleep.\r\nI am glad we came. You tell the boys about it when you go back. Cat eat\r\na cocoanut\xe2\x80\x94oh, my! Now, that is just his way, exactly\xe2\x80\x94he will tell the\r\nabsurdest lie, and trust to luck to get out of it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCat eat a cocoanut\xe2\x80\x94the innocent fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n068.jpg (84K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEckert approached with his cat, sure enough.\r\n\r\nBascom smiled. Said he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hold the cat\xe2\x80\x94you bring a cocoanut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEckert split one open, and chopped up some pieces. Bascom smuggled a\r\nwink to me, and proffered a slice of the fruit to puss. She snatched it,\r\nswallowed it ravenously, and asked for more!\r\n\r\nWe rode our two miles in silence, and wide apart. At least I was silent,\r\nthough Bascom cuffed his horse and cursed him a good deal,\r\nnotwithstanding the horse was behaving well enough. When I branched off\r\nhomeward, Bascom said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep the horse till morning. And\xe2\x80\x94you need not speak of this\xe2\x80\x94foolishness\r\nto the boys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n069.jpg (50K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a little while all interest was taken up in stretching our necks and\r\nwatching for the \xe2\x80\x9cpony-rider\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the fleet messenger who sped across the\r\ncontinent from St. Joe to Sacramento, carrying letters nineteen hundred\r\nmiles in eight days! Think of that for perishable horse and human flesh\r\nand blood to do! The pony-rider was usually a little bit of a man,\r\nbrimful of spirit and endurance. No matter what time of the day or night\r\nhis watch came on, and no matter whether it was winter or summer,\r\nraining, snowing, hailing, or sleeting, or whether his \xe2\x80\x9cbeat\xe2\x80\x9d was a\r\nlevel straight road or a crazy trail over mountain crags and precipices,\r\nor whether it led through peaceful regions or regions that swarmed with\r\nhostile Indians, he must be always ready to leap into the saddle and be\r\noff like the wind! There was no idling-time for a pony-rider on duty. He\r\nrode fifty miles without stopping, by daylight, moonlight, starlight, or\r\nthrough the blackness of darkness\xe2\x80\x94just as it happened. He rode a\r\nsplendid horse that was born for a racer and fed and lodged like a\r\ngentleman; kept him at his utmost speed for ten miles, and then, as he\r\ncame crashing up to the station where stood two men holding fast a\r\nfresh, impatient steed, the transfer of rider and mail-bag was made in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye, and away flew the eager pair and were out of\r\nsight before the spectator could get hardly the ghost of a look. Both\r\nrider and horse went \xe2\x80\x9cflying light.\xe2\x80\x9d The rider\xe2\x80\x99s dress was thin, and\r\nfitted close; he wore a \xe2\x80\x9cround-about,\xe2\x80\x9d and a skull-cap, and tucked his\r\npantaloons into his boot-tops like a race-rider. He carried no arms\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ncarried nothing that was not absolutely necessary, for even the postage\r\non his literary freight was worth _five dollars a letter_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n071.jpg (120K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe got but little frivolous correspondence to carry\xe2\x80\x94his bag had business\r\nletters in it, mostly. His horse was stripped of all unnecessary weight,\r\ntoo. He wore a little wafer of a racing-saddle, and no visible blanket.\r\nHe wore light shoes, or none at all. The little flat mail-pockets\r\nstrapped under the rider\xe2\x80\x99s thighs would each hold about the bulk of a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s primer. They held many and many an important business chapter\r\nand newspaper letter, but these were written on paper as airy and thin\r\nas gold-leaf, nearly, and thus bulk and weight were economized. The\r\nstage-coach traveled about a hundred to a hundred and twenty-five miles\r\na day (twenty-four hours), the pony-rider about two hundred and fifty.\r\nThere were about eighty pony-riders in the saddle all the time, night\r\nand day, stretching in a long, scattering procession from Missouri to\r\nCalifornia, forty flying eastward, and forty toward the west, and among\r\nthem making four hundred gallant horses earn a stirring livelihood and\r\nsee a deal of scenery every single day in the year.\r\n\r\nWe had had a consuming desire, from the beginning, to see a pony-rider,\r\nbut somehow or other all that passed us and all that met us managed to\r\nstreak by in the night, and so we heard only a whiz and a hail, and the\r\nswift phantom of the desert was gone before we could get our heads out\r\nof the windows. But now we were expecting one along every moment, and\r\nwould see him in broad daylight. Presently the driver exclaims:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHERE HE COMES!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery neck is stretched further, and every eye strained wider. Away\r\nacross the endless dead level of the prairie a black speck appears\r\nagainst the sky, and it is plain that it moves. Well, I should think so!\r\n\r\nIn a second or two it becomes a horse and rider, rising and falling,\r\nrising and falling\xe2\x80\x94sweeping toward us nearer and nearer\xe2\x80\x94growing more and\r\nmore distinct, more and more sharply defined\xe2\x80\x94nearer and still nearer,\r\nand the flutter of the hoofs comes faintly to the ear\xe2\x80\x94another instant a\r\nwhoop and a hurrah from our upper deck, a wave of the rider\xe2\x80\x99s hand, but\r\nno reply, and man and horse burst past our excited faces, and go winging\r\naway like a belated fragment of a storm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n072.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo sudden is it all, and so like a flash of unreal fancy, that but for\r\nthe flake of white foam left quivering and perishing on a mail-sack\r\nafter the vision had flashed by and disappeared, we might have doubted\r\nwhether we had seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.\r\n\r\nWe rattled through Scott\xe2\x80\x99s Bluffs Pass, by and by. It was along here\r\nsomewhere that we first came across genuine and unmistakable alkali\r\nwater in the road, and we cordially hailed it as a first-class\r\ncuriosity, and a thing to be mentioned with eclat in letters to the\r\nignorant at home. This water gave the road a soapy appearance, and in\r\nmany places the ground looked as if it had been whitewashed. I think the\r\nstrange alkali water excited us as much as any wonder we had come upon\r\nyet, and I know we felt very complacent and conceited, and better\r\nsatisfied with life after we had added it to our list of things which\r\n_we_ had seen and some other people had not. In a small way we were the\r\nsame sort of simpletons as those who climb unnecessarily the perilous\r\npeaks of Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn, and derive no pleasure from it\r\nexcept the reflection that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a common experience. But once in a\r\nwhile one of those parties trips and comes darting down the long\r\nmountain-crags in a sitting posture, making the crusted snow smoke\r\nbehind him, flitting from bench to bench, and from terrace to terrace,\r\njarring the earth where he strikes, and still glancing and flitting on\r\nagain, sticking an iceberg into himself every now and then, and tearing\r\nhis clothes, snatching at things to save himself, taking hold of trees\r\nand fetching them along with him, roots and all, starting little rocks\r\nnow and then, then big boulders, then acres of ice and snow and patches\r\nof forest, gathering and still gathering as he goes, adding and still\r\nadding to his massed and sweeping grandeur as he nears a three thousand-\r\nfoot precipice, till at last he waves his hat magnificently and rides\r\ninto eternity on the back of a raging and tossing avalanche!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n073.jpg (48K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is all very fine, but let us not be carried away by excitement, but\r\nask calmly, how does this person feel about it in his cooler moments\r\nnext day, with six or seven thousand feet of snow and stuff on top of\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nWe crossed the sand hills near the scene of the Indian mail robbery and\r\nmassacre of 1856, wherein the driver and conductor perished, and also\r\nall the passengers but one, it was supposed; but this must have been a\r\nmistake, for at different times afterward on the Pacific coast I was\r\npersonally acquainted with a hundred and thirty-three or four people who\r\nwere wounded during that massacre, and barely escaped with their lives.\r\nThere was no doubt of the truth of it\xe2\x80\x94I had it from their own lips. One\r\nof these parties told me that he kept coming across arrow-heads in his\r\nsystem for nearly seven years after the massacre; and another of them\r\ntold me that he was struck so literally full of arrows that after the\r\nIndians were gone and he could raise up and examine himself, he could\r\nnot restrain his tears, for his clothes were completely ruined.\r\n\r\nThe most trustworthy tradition avers, however, that only one man, a\r\nperson named Babbitt, survived the massacre, and he was desperately\r\nwounded. He dragged himself on his hands and knee (for one leg was\r\nbroken) to a station several miles away. He did it during portions of\r\ntwo nights, lying concealed one day and part of another, and for more\r\nthan forty hours suffering unimaginable anguish from hunger, thirst and\r\nbodily pain. The Indians robbed the coach of everything it contained,\r\nincluding quite an amount of treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe passed Fort Laramie in the night, and on the seventh morning out we\r\nfound ourselves in the Black Hills, with Laramie Peak at our elbow\r\n(apparently) looming vast and solitary\xe2\x80\x94a deep, dark, rich indigo blue in\r\nhue, so portentously did the old colossus frown under his beetling brows\r\nof storm-cloud. He was thirty or forty miles away, in reality, but he\r\nonly seemed removed a little beyond the low ridge at our right. We\r\nbreakfasted at Horse-Shoe Station, six hundred and seventy-six miles out\r\nfrom St. Joseph. We had now reached a hostile Indian country, and during\r\nthe afternoon we passed Laparelle Station, and enjoyed great discomfort\r\nall the time we were in the neighborhood, being aware that many of the\r\ntrees we dashed by at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length concealed a lurking Indian or two.\r\nDuring the preceding night an ambushed savage had sent a bullet through\r\nthe pony-rider\xe2\x80\x99s jacket, but he had ridden on, just the same, because\r\npony-riders were not allowed to stop and inquire into such things except\r\nwhen killed. As long as they had life enough left in them they had to\r\nstick to the horse and ride, even if the Indians had been waiting for\r\nthem a week, and were entirely out of patience. About two hours and a\r\nhalf before we arrived at Laparelle Station, the keeper in charge of it\r\nhad fired four times at an Indian, but he said with an injured air that\r\nthe Indian had \xe2\x80\x9cskipped around so\xe2\x80\x99s to spile everything\xe2\x80\x94and ammunition\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nblamed skurse, too.\xe2\x80\x9d The most natural inference conveyed by his manner\r\nof speaking was, that in \xe2\x80\x9cskipping around,\xe2\x80\x9d the Indian had taken an\r\nunfair advantage.\r\n\r\nThe coach we were in had a neat hole through its front\xe2\x80\x94a reminiscence of\r\nits last trip through this region. The bullet that made it wounded the\r\ndriver slightly, but he did not mind it much. He said the place to keep\r\na man \xe2\x80\x9chuffy\xe2\x80\x9d was down on the Southern Overland, among the Apaches,\r\nbefore the company moved the stage line up on the northern route. He\r\nsaid the Apaches used to annoy him all the time down there, and that he\r\ncame as near as anything to starving to death in the midst of abundance,\r\nbecause they kept him so leaky with bullet holes that he \xe2\x80\x9ccouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold\r\nhis vittles.\xe2\x80\x9d This person\xe2\x80\x99s statements were not generally believed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n076.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shut the blinds down very tightly that first night in the hostile\r\nIndian country, and lay on our arms. We slept on them some, but most of\r\nthe time we only lay on them. We did not talk much, but kept quiet and\r\nlistened. It was an inky-black night, and occasionally rainy. We were\r\namong woods and rocks, hills and gorges\xe2\x80\x94so shut in, in fact, that when\r\nwe peeped through a chink in a curtain, we could discern nothing. The\r\ndriver and conductor on top were still, too, or only spoke at long\r\nintervals, in low tones, as is the way of men in the midst of invisible\r\ndangers. We listened to rain-drops pattering on the roof; and the\r\ngrinding of the wheels through the muddy gravel; and the low wailing of\r\nthe wind; and all the time we had that absurd sense upon us, inseparable\r\nfrom travel at night in a close-curtained vehicle, the sense of\r\nremaining perfectly still in one place, notwithstanding the jolting and\r\nswaying of the vehicle, the trampling of the horses, and the grinding of\r\nthe wheels. We listened a long time, with intent faculties and bated\r\nbreath; every time one of us would relax, and draw a long sigh of relief\r\nand start to say something, a comrade would be sure to utter a sudden\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d and instantly the experimenter was rigid and listening again. So\r\nthe tiresome minutes and decades of minutes dragged away, until at last\r\nour tense forms filmed over with a dulled consciousness, and we slept,\r\nif one might call such a condition by so strong a name\xe2\x80\x94for it was a\r\nsleep set with a hair-trigger. It was a sleep seething and teeming with\r\na weird and distressful confusion of shreds and fag-ends of dreams\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsleep that was a chaos. Presently, dreams and sleep and the sullen hush\r\nof the night were startled by a ringing report, and cloven by _such_ a\r\nlong, wild, agonizing shriek! Then we heard\xe2\x80\x94ten steps from the stage\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help! help!\xe2\x80\x9d [It was our driver\xe2\x80\x99s voice.]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKill him! Kill him like a dog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m being murdered! Will no man lend me a pistol?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook out! head him off! head him off!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[Two pistol shots; a confusion of voices and the trampling of many feet,\r\nas if a crowd were closing and surging together around some object;\r\nseveral heavy, dull blows, as with a club; a voice that said\r\nappealingly, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, gentlemen, please don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m a dead man!\xe2\x80\x9d Then a\r\nfainter groan, and another blow, and away sped the stage into the\r\ndarkness, and left the grisly mystery behind us.]\r\n\r\nWhat a startle it was! Eight seconds would amply cover the time it\r\noccupied\xe2\x80\x94maybe even five would do it. We only had time to plunge at a\r\ncurtain and unbuckle and unbutton part of it in an awkward and hindering\r\nflurry, when our whip cracked sharply overhead, and we went rumbling and\r\nthundering away, down a mountain \xe2\x80\x9cgrade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe fed on that mystery the rest of the night\xe2\x80\x94what was left of it, for it\r\nwas waning fast. It had to remain a present mystery, for all we could\r\nget from the conductor in answer to our hails was something that\r\nsounded, through the clatter of the wheels, like \xe2\x80\x9cTell you in the\r\nmorning!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we lit our pipes and opened the corner of a curtain for a chimney,\r\nand lay there in the dark, listening to each other\xe2\x80\x99s story of how he\r\nfirst felt and how many thousand Indians he first thought had hurled\r\nthemselves upon us, and what his remembrance of the subsequent sounds\r\nwas, and the order of their occurrence. And we theorized, too, but there\r\nwas never a theory that would account for our driver\xe2\x80\x99s voice being out\r\nthere, nor yet account for his Indian murderers talking such good\r\nEnglish, if they _were_ Indians.\r\n\r\nSo we chatted and smoked the rest of the night comfortably away, our\r\nboding anxiety being somehow marvelously dissipated by the real presence\r\nof something to be anxious _about_.\r\n\r\nWe never did get much satisfaction about that dark occurrence. All that\r\nwe could make out of the odds and ends of the information we gathered in\r\nthe morning, was that the disturbance occurred at a station; that we\r\nchanged drivers there, and that the driver that got off there had been\r\ntalking roughly about some of the outlaws that infested the region (\xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a man around there but had a price on his head and didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndare show himself in the settlements,\xe2\x80\x9d the conductor said); he had\r\ntalked roughly about these characters, and ought to have \xe2\x80\x9cdrove up there\r\nwith his pistol cocked and ready on the seat alongside of him, and begun\r\nbusiness himself, because any softy would know they would be laying for\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was all we could gather, and we could see that neither the\r\nconductor nor the new driver were much concerned about the matter. They\r\nplainly had little respect for a man who would deliver offensive\r\nopinions of people and then be so simple as to come into their presence\r\nunprepared to \xe2\x80\x9cback his judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d as they pleasantly phrased the\r\nkilling of any fellow-being who did not like said opinions. And likewise\r\nthey plainly had a contempt for the man\xe2\x80\x99s poor discretion in venturing\r\nto rouse the wrath of such utterly reckless wild beasts as those\r\noutlaws\xe2\x80\x94and the conductor added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s as much as Slade himself wants to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis remark created an entire revolution in my curiosity. I cared\r\nnothing now about the Indians, and even lost interest in the murdered\r\ndriver. There was such magic in that name, SLADE! Day or night, now, I\r\nstood always ready to drop any subject in hand, to listen to something\r\nnew about Slade and his ghastly exploits. Even before we got to Overland\r\nCity, we had begun to hear about Slade and his \xe2\x80\x9cdivision\xe2\x80\x9d (for he was a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdivision-agent\xe2\x80\x9d) on the Overland; and from the hour we had left\r\nOverland City we had heard drivers and conductors talk about only three\r\nthings\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCaliforny,\xe2\x80\x9d the Nevada silver mines, and this desperado Slade.\r\nAnd a deal the most of the talk was about Slade. We had gradually come\r\nto have a realizing sense of the fact that Slade was a man whose heart\r\nand hands and soul were steeped in the blood of offenders against his\r\ndignity; a man who awfully avenged all injuries, affront, insults or\r\nslights, of whatever kind\xe2\x80\x94on the spot if he could, years afterward if\r\nlack of earlier opportunity compelled it; a man whose hate tortured him\r\nday and night till vengeance appeased it\xe2\x80\x94and not an ordinary vengeance\r\neither, but his enemy\xe2\x80\x99s absolute death\xe2\x80\x94nothing less; a man whose face\r\nwould light up with a terrible joy when he surprised a foe and had him\r\nat a disadvantage. A high and efficient servant of the Overland, an\r\noutlaw among outlaws and yet their relentless scourge, Slade was at once\r\nthe most bloody, the most dangerous and the most valuable citizen that\r\ninhabited the savage fastnesses of the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nReally and truly, two thirds of the talk of drivers and conductors had\r\nbeen about this man Slade, ever since the day before we reached\r\nJulesburg. In order that the eastern reader may have a clear conception\r\nof what a Rocky Mountain desperado is, in his highest state of\r\ndevelopment, I will reduce all this mass of overland gossip to one\r\nstraightforward narrative, and present it in the following shape:\r\n\r\nSlade was born in Illinois, of good parentage. At about twenty-six years\r\nof age he killed a man in a quarrel and fled the country. At St. Joseph,\r\nMissouri, he joined one of the early California-bound emigrant trains,\r\nand was given the post of train-master. One day on the plains he had an\r\nangry dispute with one of his wagon-drivers, and both drew their\r\nrevolvers. But the driver was the quicker artist, and had his weapon\r\ncocked first. So Slade said it was a pity to waste life on so small a\r\nmatter, and proposed that the pistols be thrown on the ground and the\r\nquarrel settled by a fist-fight. The unsuspecting driver agreed, and\r\nthrew down his pistol\xe2\x80\x94whereupon Slade laughed at his simplicity, and\r\nshot him dead!\r\n\r\nHe made his escape, and lived a wild life for awhile, dividing his time\r\nbetween fighting Indians and avoiding an Illinois sheriff, who had been\r\nsent to arrest him for his first murder. It is said that in one Indian\r\nbattle he killed three savages with his own hand, and afterward cut\r\ntheir ears off and sent them, with his compliments, to the chief of the\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n081.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlade soon gained a name for fearless resolution, and this was\r\nsufficient merit to procure for him the important post of overland\r\ndivision-agent at Julesburg, in place of Mr. Jules, removed. For some\r\ntime previously, the company\xe2\x80\x99s horses had been frequently stolen, and\r\nthe coaches delayed, by gangs of outlaws, who were wont to laugh at the\r\nidea of any man\xe2\x80\x99s having the temerity to resent such outrages. Slade\r\nresented them promptly.\r\n\r\nThe outlaws soon found that the new agent was a man who did not fear\r\nanything that breathed the breath of life. He made short work of all\r\noffenders. The result was that delays ceased, the company\xe2\x80\x99s property was\r\nlet alone, and no matter what happened or who suffered, Slade\xe2\x80\x99s coaches\r\nwent through, every time! True, in order to bring about this wholesome\r\nchange, Slade had to kill several men\xe2\x80\x94some say three, others say four,\r\nand others six\xe2\x80\x94but the world was the richer for their loss. The first\r\nprominent difficulty he had was with the ex-agent Jules, who bore the\r\nreputation of being a reckless and desperate man himself. Jules hated\r\nSlade for supplanting him, and a good fair occasion for a fight was all\r\nhe was waiting for. By and by Slade dared to employ a man whom Jules had\r\nonce discharged. Next, Slade seized a team of stage-horses which he\r\naccused Jules of having driven off and hidden somewhere for his own use.\r\nWar was declared, and for a day or two the two men walked warily about\r\nthe streets, seeking each other, Jules armed with a double-barreled shot\r\ngun, and Slade with his history-creating revolver. Finally, as Slade\r\nstepped into a store Jules poured the contents of his gun into him from\r\nbehind the door. Slade was pluck, and Jules got several bad pistol\r\nwounds in return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n082.jpg (157K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen both men fell, and were carried to their respective lodgings, both\r\nswearing that better aim should do deadlier work next time. Both were\r\nbedridden a long time, but Jules got to his feet first, and gathering\r\nhis possessions together, packed them on a couple of mules, and fled to\r\nthe Rocky Mountains to gather strength in safety against the day of\r\nreckoning. For many months he was not seen or heard of, and was\r\ngradually dropped out of the remembrance of all save Slade himself. But\r\nSlade was not the man to forget him. On the contrary, common report said\r\nthat Slade kept a reward standing for his capture, dead or alive!\r\n\r\nAfter awhile, seeing that Slade\xe2\x80\x99s energetic administration had restored\r\npeace and order to one of the worst divisions of the road, the overland\r\nstage company transferred him to the Rocky Ridge division in the Rocky\r\nMountains, to see if he could perform a like miracle there. It was the\r\nvery paradise of outlaws and desperadoes. There was absolutely no\r\nsemblance of law there. Violence was the rule. Force was the only\r\nrecognized authority. The commonest misunderstandings were settled on\r\nthe spot with the revolver or the knife. Murders were done in open day,\r\nand with sparkling frequency, and nobody thought of inquiring into them.\r\nIt was considered that the parties who did the killing had their private\r\nreasons for it; for other people to meddle would have been looked upon\r\nas indelicate. After a murder, all that Rocky Mountain etiquette\r\nrequired of a spectator was, that he should help the gentleman bury his\r\ngame\xe2\x80\x94otherwise his churlishness would surely be remembered against him\r\nthe first time he killed a man himself and needed a neighborly turn in\r\ninterring him.\r\n\r\nSlade took up his residence sweetly and peacefully in the midst of this\r\nhive of horse-thieves and assassins, and the very first time one of them\r\naired his insolent swaggerings in his presence he shot him dead! He\r\nbegan a raid on the outlaws, and in a singularly short space of time he\r\nhad completely stopped their depredations on the stage stock, recovered\r\na large number of stolen horses, killed several of the worst desperadoes\r\nof the district, and gained such a dread ascendancy over the rest that\r\nthey respected him, admired him, feared him, obeyed him! He wrought the\r\nsame marvelous change in the ways of the community that had marked his\r\nadministration at Overland City. He captured two men who had stolen\r\noverland stock, and with his own hands he hanged them. He was supreme\r\njudge in his district, and he was jury and executioner likewise\xe2\x80\x94and not\r\nonly in the case of offences against his employers, but against passing\r\nemigrants as well. On one occasion some emigrants had their stock lost\r\nor stolen, and told Slade, who chanced to visit their camp. With a\r\nsingle companion he rode to a ranch, the owners of which he suspected,\r\nand opening the door, commenced firing, killing three, and wounding the\r\nfourth.\r\n\r\nFrom a bloodthirstily interesting little Montana book.\xe2\x80\x94[\xe2\x80\x9cThe Vigilantes\r\nof Montana,\xe2\x80\x9d by Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale.]\xe2\x80\x94I take this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile on the road, Slade held absolute sway. He would ride down to a\r\nstation, get into a quarrel, turn the house out of windows, and maltreat\r\nthe occupants most cruelly. The unfortunates had no means of redress,\r\nand were compelled to recuperate as best they could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n084.jpg (67K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn one of these occasions, it is said he killed the father of the fine\r\nlittle half-breed boy Jemmy, whom he adopted, and who lived with his\r\nwidow after his execution. Stories of Slade\xe2\x80\x99s hanging men, and of\r\ninnumerable assaults, shootings, stabbings and beatings, in which he was\r\na principal actor, form part of the legends of the stage line. As for\r\nminor quarrels and shootings, it is absolutely certain that a minute\r\nhistory of Slade\xe2\x80\x99s life would be one long record of such practices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Vigilantes of Montana\xe2\x80\x9d by Prof. Thomas J. Dimsdale\r\n\r\nSlade was a matchless marksman with a navy revolver. The legends say\r\nthat one morning at Rocky Ridge, when he was feeling comfortable, he saw\r\na man approaching who had offended him some days before\xe2\x80\x94observe the fine\r\nmemory he had for matters like that\xe2\x80\x94and, \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Slade,\r\ndrawing, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a good twenty-yard shot\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll clip the third button on\r\nhis coat!\xe2\x80\x9d Which he did. The bystanders all admired it. And they all\r\nattended the funeral, too.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a man who kept a little whisky-shelf at the station did\r\nsomething which angered Slade\xe2\x80\x94and went and made his will. A day or two\r\nafterward Slade came in and called for some brandy. The man reached\r\nunder the counter (ostensibly to get a bottle\xe2\x80\x94possibly to get something\r\nelse), but Slade smiled upon him that peculiarly bland and satisfied\r\nsmile of his which the neighbors had long ago learned to recognize as a\r\ndeath-warrant in disguise, and told him to \xe2\x80\x9cnone of that!\xe2\x80\x94pass out the\r\nhigh-priced article.\xe2\x80\x9d So the poor bar-keeper had to turn his back and\r\nget the high-priced brandy from the shelf; and when he faced around\r\nagain he was looking into the muzzle of Slade\xe2\x80\x99s pistol. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the next\r\ninstant,\xe2\x80\x9d added my informant, impressively, \xe2\x80\x9che was one of the deadest\r\nmen that ever lived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n085.jpg (94K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stage-drivers and conductors told us that sometimes Slade would\r\nleave a hated enemy wholly unmolested, unnoticed and unmentioned, for\r\nweeks together\xe2\x80\x94had done it once or twice at any rate. And some said they\r\nbelieved he did it in order to lull the victims into unwatchfulness, so\r\nthat he could get the advantage of them, and others said they believed\r\nhe saved up an enemy that way, just as a schoolboy saves up a cake, and\r\nmade the pleasure go as far as it would by gloating over the\r\nanticipation. One of these cases was that of a Frenchman who had\r\noffended Slade. To the surprise of everybody Slade did not kill him on\r\nthe spot, but let him alone for a considerable time. Finally, however,\r\nhe went to the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s house very late one night, knocked, and when\r\nhis enemy opened the door, shot him dead\xe2\x80\x94pushed the corpse inside the\r\ndoor with his foot, set the house on fire and burned up the dead man,\r\nhis widow and three children! I heard this story from several different\r\npeople, and they evidently believed what they were saying. It may be\r\ntrue, and it may not. \xe2\x80\x9cGive a dog a bad name,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\r\n\r\nSlade was captured, once, by a party of men who intended to lynch him.\r\nThey disarmed him, and shut him up in a strong log-house, and placed a\r\nguard over him. He prevailed on his captors to send for his wife, so\r\nthat he might have a last interview with her. She was a brave, loving,\r\nspirited woman. She jumped on a horse and rode for life and death. When\r\nshe arrived they let her in without searching her, and before the door\r\ncould be closed she whipped out a couple of revolvers, and she and her\r\nlord marched forth defying the party. And then, under a brisk fire, they\r\nmounted double and galloped away unharmed!\r\n\r\nIn the fulness of time Slade\xe2\x80\x99s myrmidons captured his ancient enemy\r\nJules, whom they found in a well-chosen hiding-place in the remote\r\nfastnesses of the mountains, gaining a precarious livelihood with his\r\nrifle. They brought him to Rocky Ridge, bound hand and foot, and\r\ndeposited him in the middle of the cattle-yard with his back against a\r\npost. It is said that the pleasure that lit Slade\xe2\x80\x99s face when he heard\r\nof it was something fearful to contemplate. He examined his enemy to see\r\nthat he was securely tied, and then went to bed, content to wait till\r\nmorning before enjoying the luxury of killing him. Jules spent the night\r\nin the cattle-yard, and it is a region where warm nights are never\r\nknown. In the morning Slade practised on him with his revolver, nipping\r\nthe flesh here and there, and occasionally clipping off a finger, while\r\nJules begged him to kill him outright and put him out of his misery.\r\nFinally Slade reloaded, and walking up close to his victim, made some\r\ncharacteristic remarks and then dispatched him. The body lay there half\r\na day, nobody venturing to touch it without orders, and then Slade\r\ndetailed a party and assisted at the burial himself. But he first cut\r\noff the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s ears and put them in his vest pocket, where he\r\ncarried them for some time with great satisfaction. That is the story as\r\nI have frequently heard it told and seen it in print in California\r\nnewspapers. It is doubtless correct in all essential particulars.\r\n\r\nIn due time we rattled up to a stage-station, and sat down to breakfast\r\nwith a half-savage, half-civilized company of armed and bearded\r\nmountaineers, ranchmen and station employees. The most gentlemanly-\r\nappearing, quiet and affable officer we had yet found along the road in\r\nthe Overland Company\xe2\x80\x99s service was the person who sat at the head of the\r\ntable, at my elbow. Never youth stared and shivered as I did when I\r\nheard them call him SLADE!\r\n\r\nHere was romance, and I sitting face to face with it!\xe2\x80\x94looking upon\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94touching it\xe2\x80\x94hobnobbing with it, as it were! Here, right by my side,\r\nwas the actual ogre who, in fights and brawls and various ways, _had\r\ntaken the lives of twenty-six human beings_, or all men lied about him!\r\nI suppose I was the proudest stripling that ever traveled to see strange\r\nlands and wonderful people.\r\n\r\nHe was so friendly and so gentle-spoken that I warmed to him in spite of\r\nhis awful history. It was hardly possible to realize that this pleasant\r\nperson was the pitiless scourge of the outlaws, the raw-head-and-bloody-\r\nbones the nursing mothers of the mountains terrified their children\r\nwith. And to this day I can remember nothing remarkable about Slade\r\nexcept that his face was rather broad across the cheek bones, and that\r\nthe cheek bones were low and the lips peculiarly thin and straight. But\r\nthat was enough to leave something of an effect upon me, for since then\r\nI seldom see a face possessing those characteristics without fancying\r\nthat the owner of it is a dangerous man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n088.jpg (57K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coffee ran out. At least it was reduced to one tin-cupful, and Slade\r\nwas about to take it when he saw that my cup was empty.\r\n\r\nHe politely offered to fill it, but although I wanted it, I politely\r\ndeclined. I was afraid he had not killed anybody that morning, and might\r\nbe needing diversion. But still with firm politeness he insisted on\r\nfilling my cup, and said I had traveled all night and better deserved it\r\nthan he\xe2\x80\x94and while he talked he placidly poured the fluid, to the last\r\ndrop. I thanked him and drank it, but it gave me no comfort, for I could\r\nnot feel sure that he would not be sorry, presently, that he had given\r\nit away, and proceed to kill me to distract his thoughts from the loss.\r\nBut nothing of the kind occurred. We left him with only twenty-six dead\r\npeople to account for, and I felt a tranquil satisfaction in the thought\r\nthat in so judiciously taking care of No. 1 at that breakfast-table I\r\nhad pleasantly escaped being No. 27. Slade came out to the coach and saw\r\nus off, first ordering certain rearrangements of the mail-bags for our\r\ncomfort, and then we took leave of him, satisfied that we should hear of\r\nhim again, some day, and wondering in what connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n089.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, two or three years afterward, we did hear him again.\r\nNews came to the Pacific coast that the Vigilance Committee in Montana\r\n(whither Slade had removed from Rocky Ridge) had hanged him. I find an\r\naccount of the affair in the thrilling little book I quoted a paragraph\r\nfrom in the last chapter\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe Vigilantes of Montana; being a Reliable\r\nAccount of the Capture, Trial and Execution of Henry Plummer\xe2\x80\x99s Notorious\r\nRoad Agent Band: By Prof. Thos. J. Dimsdale, Virginia City, M.T.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nDimsdale\xe2\x80\x99s chapter is well worth reading, as a specimen of how the\r\npeople of the frontier deal with criminals when the courts of law prove\r\ninefficient. Mr. Dimsdale makes two remarks about Slade, both of which\r\nare accurately descriptive, and one of which is exceedingly picturesque:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who saw him in his natural state only, would pronounce him to be\r\na kind husband, a most hospitable host and a courteous gentleman; on the\r\ncontrary, those who met him when maddened with liquor and surrounded by\r\na gang of armed roughs, would pronounce him a fiend incarnate.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nthis: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Fort Kearney, west, _he was feared A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN\r\nTHE ALMIGHTY_.\xe2\x80\x9d For compactness, simplicity and vigor of expression, I\r\nwill \xe2\x80\x9cback\xe2\x80\x9d that sentence against anything in literature. Mr. Dimsdale\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnarrative is as follows. In all places where italics occur, they are\r\nmine:\r\n\r\nAfter the execution of the five men on the 14th of January, the\r\nVigilantes considered that their work was nearly ended. They had freed\r\nthe country of highwaymen and murderers to a great extent, and they\r\ndetermined that in the absence of the regular civil authority they would\r\nestablish a People\xe2\x80\x99s Court where all offenders should be tried by judge\r\nand jury. This was the nearest approach to social order that the\r\ncircumstances permitted, and, though strict legal authority was wanting,\r\nyet the people were firmly determined to maintain its efficiency, and to\r\nenforce its decrees. It may here be mentioned that the overt act which\r\nwas the last round on the fatal ladder leading to the scaffold on which\r\nSlade perished, was the tearing in pieces and stamping upon a writ of\r\nthis court, followed by his arrest of the Judge Alex. Davis, by\r\nauthority of a presented Derringer, and with his own hands.\r\n\r\nJ. A. Slade was himself, we have been informed, a Vigilante; he openly\r\nboasted of it, and said he knew all that they knew. He was never\r\naccused, or even suspected, of either murder or robbery, committed in\r\nthis Territory (the latter crime was never laid to his charge, in any\r\nplace); but that he had killed several men in other localities was\r\nnotorious, and his bad reputation in this respect was a most powerful\r\nargument in determining his fate, when he was finally arrested for the\r\noffence above mentioned. On returning from Milk River he became more and\r\nmore addicted to drinking, until at last it was a common feat for him\r\nand his friends to \xe2\x80\x9ctake the town.\xe2\x80\x9d He and a couple of his dependents\r\nmight often be seen on one horse, galloping through the streets,\r\nshouting and yelling, firing revolvers, etc. On many occasions he would\r\nride his horse into stores, break up bars, toss the scales out of doors\r\nand use most insulting language to parties present. Just previous to the\r\nday of his arrest, he had given a fearful beating to one of his\r\nfollowers; but such was his influence over them that the man wept\r\nbitterly at the gallows, and begged for his life with all his power. It\r\nhad become quite common, when Slade was on a spree, for the shop-keepers\r\nand citizens to close the stores and put out all the lights; being\r\nfearful of some outrage at his hands. For his wanton destruction of\r\ngoods and furniture, he was always ready to pay, when sober, if he had\r\nmoney; but there were not a few who regarded payment as small\r\nsatisfaction for the outrage, and these men were his personal enemies.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Slade received warnings from men that he well knew\r\nwould not deceive him, of the certain end of his conduct. There was not\r\na moment, for weeks previous to his arrest, in which the public did not\r\nexpect to hear of some bloody outrage. The dread of his very name, and\r\nthe presence of the armed band of hangers-on who followed him alone\r\nprevented a resistance which must certainly have ended in the instant\r\nmurder or mutilation of the opposing party.\r\n\r\nSlade was frequently arrested by order of the court whose organization\r\nwe have described, and had treated it with respect by paying one or two\r\nfines and promising to pay the rest when he had money; but in the\r\ntransaction that occurred at this crisis, he forgot even this caution,\r\nand goaded by passion and the hatred of restraint, he sprang into the\r\nembrace of death.\r\n\r\nSlade had been drunk and \xe2\x80\x9ccutting up\xe2\x80\x9d all night. He and his companions\r\nhad made the town a perfect hell. In the morning, J. M. Fox, the\r\nsheriff, met him, arrested him, took him into court and commenced\r\nreading a warrant that he had for his arrest, by way of arraignment. He\r\nbecame uncontrollably furious, and seizing the writ, he tore it up,\r\nthrew it on the ground and stamped upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n092.jpg (121K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clicking of the locks of his companions\xe2\x80\x99 revolvers was instantly\r\nheard, and a crisis was expected. The sheriff did not attempt his\r\nretention; but being at least as prudent as he was valiant, he\r\nsuccumbed, leaving Slade the master of the situation and the conqueror\r\nand ruler of the courts, law and law-makers. This was a declaration of\r\nwar, and was so accepted. The Vigilance Committee now felt that the\r\nquestion of social order and the preponderance of the law-abiding\r\ncitizens had then and there to be decided. They knew the character of\r\nSlade, and they were well aware that they must submit to his rule\r\nwithout murmur, or else that he must be dealt with in such fashion as\r\nwould prevent his being able to wreak his vengeance on the committee,\r\nwho could never have hoped to live in the Territory secure from outrage\r\nor death, and who could never leave it without encountering his friends,\r\nwhom his victory would have emboldened and stimulated to a pitch that\r\nwould have rendered them reckless of consequences. The day previous he\r\nhad ridden into Dorris\xe2\x80\x99s store, and on being requested to leave, he drew\r\nhis revolver and threatened to kill the gentleman who spoke to him.\r\nAnother saloon he had led his horse into, and buying a bottle of wine,\r\nhe tried to make the animal drink it. This was not considered an\r\nuncommon performance, as he had often entered saloons and commenced\r\nfiring at the lamps, causing a wild stampede.\r\n\r\nA leading member of the committee met Slade, and informed him in the\r\nquiet, earnest manner of one who feels the importance of what he is\r\nsaying: \xe2\x80\x9cSlade, get your horse at once, and go home, or there will\r\nbe\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94to pay.\xe2\x80\x9d Slade started and took a long look, with his dark and\r\npiercing eyes, at the gentleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have\r\nno right to ask me what I mean,\xe2\x80\x9d was the quiet reply, \xe2\x80\x9cget your horse at\r\nonce, and remember what I tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d After a short pause he promised to\r\ndo so, and actually got into the saddle; but, being still intoxicated,\r\nhe began calling aloud to one after another of his friends, and at last\r\nseemed to have forgotten the warning he had received and became again\r\nuproarious, shouting the name of a well-known courtezan in company with\r\nthose of two men whom he considered heads of the committee, as a sort of\r\nchallenge; perhaps, however, as a simple act of bravado. It seems\r\nprobable that the intimation of personal danger he had received had not\r\nbeen forgotten entirely; though fatally for him, he took a foolish way\r\nof showing his remembrance of it. He sought out Alexander Davis, the\r\nJudge of the Court, and drawing a cocked Derringer, he presented it at\r\nhis head, and told him that he should hold him as a hostage for his own\r\nsafety. As the judge stood perfectly quiet, and offered no resistance to\r\nhis captor, no further outrage followed on this score. Previous to this,\r\non account of the critical state of affairs, the committee had met, and\r\nat last resolved to arrest him. His execution had not been agreed upon,\r\nand, at that time, would have been negatived, most assuredly. A\r\nmessenger rode down to Nevada to inform the leading men of what was on\r\nhand, as it was desirable to show that there was a feeling of unanimity\r\non the subject, all along the gulch.\r\n\r\nThe miners turned out almost en masse, leaving their work and forming in\r\nsolid column about six hundred strong, armed to the teeth, they marched\r\nup to Virginia. The leader of the body well knew the temper of his men\r\non the subject. He spurred on ahead of them, and hastily calling a\r\nmeeting of the executive, he told them plainly that the miners meant\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, if they came up, they would not stand in the\r\nstreet to be shot down by Slade\xe2\x80\x99s friends; but that they would take him\r\nand hang him. The meeting was small, as the Virginia men were loath to\r\nact at all. This momentous announcement of the feeling of the Lower Town\r\nwas made to a cluster of men, who were deliberating behind a wagon, at\r\nthe rear of a store on Main street.\r\n\r\nThe committee were most unwilling to proceed to extremities. All the\r\nduty they had ever performed seemed as nothing to the task before them;\r\nbut they had to decide, and that quickly. It was finally agreed that if\r\nthe whole body of the miners were of the opinion that he should be\r\nhanged, that the committee left it in their hands to deal with him. Off,\r\nat hot speed, rode the leader of the Nevada men to join his command.\r\n\r\nSlade had found out what was intended, and the news sobered him\r\ninstantly. He went into P. S. Pfouts\xe2\x80\x99 store, where Davis was, and\r\napologized for his conduct, saying that he would take it all back.\r\n\r\nThe head of the column now wheeled into Wallace street and marched up at\r\nquick time. Halting in front of the store, the executive officer of the\r\ncommittee stepped forward and arrested Slade, who was at once informed\r\nof his doom, and inquiry was made as to whether he had any business to\r\nsettle. Several parties spoke to him on the subject; but to all such\r\ninquiries he turned a deaf ear, being entirely absorbed in the\r\nterrifying reflections on his own awful position. He never ceased his\r\nentreaties for life, and to see his dear wife. The unfortunate lady\r\nreferred to, between whom and Slade there existed a warm affection, was\r\nat this time living at their ranch on the Madison. She was possessed of\r\nconsiderable personal attractions; tall, well-formed, of graceful\r\ncarriage, pleasing manners, and was, withal, an accomplished horsewoman.\r\n\r\nA messenger from Slade rode at full speed to inform her of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrest. In an instant she was in the saddle, and with all the energy\r\nthat love and despair could lend to an ardent temperament and a strong\r\nphysique, she urged her fleet charger over the twelve miles of rough and\r\nrocky ground that intervened between her and the object of her\r\npassionate devotion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a party of volunteers had made the necessary preparations for\r\nthe execution, in the valley traversed by the branch. Beneath the site\r\nof Pfouts and Russell\xe2\x80\x99s stone building there was a corral, the gate-\r\nposts of which were strong and high. Across the top was laid a beam, to\r\nwhich the rope was fastened, and a dry-goods box served for the\r\nplatform. To this place Slade was marched, surrounded by a guard,\r\ncomposing the best armed and most numerous force that has ever appeared\r\nin Montana Territory.\r\n\r\nThe doomed man had so exhausted himself by tears, prayers and\r\nlamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand under the\r\nfatal beam. He repeatedly exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! my God! must I die? Oh, my\r\ndear wife!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the return of the fatigue party, they encountered some friends of\r\nSlade, staunch and reliable citizens and members of the committee, but\r\nwho were personally attached to the condemned. On hearing of his\r\nsentence, one of them, a stout-hearted man, pulled out his handkerchief\r\nand walked away, weeping like a child. Slade still begged to see his\r\nwife, most piteously, and it seemed hard to deny his request; but the\r\nbloody consequences that were sure to follow the inevitable attempt at a\r\nrescue, that her presence and entreaties would have certainly incited,\r\nforbade the granting of his request. Several gentlemen were sent for to\r\nsee him, in his last moments, one of whom (Judge Davis) made a short\r\naddress to the people; but in such low tones as to be inaudible, save to\r\na few in his immediate vicinity. One of his friends, after exhausting\r\nhis powers of entreaty, threw off his coat and declared that the\r\nprisoner could not be hanged until he himself was killed. A hundred guns\r\nwere instantly leveled at him; whereupon he turned and fled; but, being\r\nbrought back, he was compelled to resume his coat, and to give a promise\r\nof future peaceable demeanor.\r\n\r\nScarcely a leading man in Virginia could be found, though numbers of the\r\ncitizens joined the ranks of the guard when the arrest was made. All\r\nlamented the stern necessity which dictated the execution.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready, the command was given, \xe2\x80\x9cMen, do your duty,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe box being instantly slipped from beneath his feet, he died almost\r\ninstantaneously.\r\n\r\nThe body was cut down and carried to the Virginia Hotel, where, in a\r\ndarkened room, it was scarcely laid out, when the unfortunate and\r\nbereaved companion of the deceased arrived, at headlong speed, to find\r\nthat all was over, and that she was a widow. Her grief and heart-\r\npiercing cries were terrible evidences of the depth of her attachment\r\nfor her lost husband, and a considerable period elapsed before she could\r\nregain the command of her excited feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n095.jpg (48K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something about the desperado-nature that is wholly\r\nunaccountable\xe2\x80\x94at least it looks unaccountable. It is this. The true\r\ndesperado is gifted with splendid courage, and yet he will take the most\r\ninfamous advantage of his enemy; armed and free, he will stand up before\r\na host and fight until he is shot all to pieces, and yet when he is\r\nunder the gallows and helpless he will cry and plead like a child. Words\r\nare cheap, and it is easy to call Slade a coward (all executed men who\r\ndo not \xe2\x80\x9cdie game\xe2\x80\x9d are promptly called cowards by unreflecting people),\r\nand when we read of Slade that he \xe2\x80\x9chad so exhausted himself by tears,\r\nprayers and lamentations, that he had scarcely strength left to stand\r\nunder the fatal beam,\xe2\x80\x9d the disgraceful word suggests itself in a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x94yet in frequently defying and inviting the vengeance of banded\r\nRocky Mountain cut-throats by shooting down their comrades and leaders,\r\nand never offering to hide or fly, Slade showed that he was a man of\r\npeerless bravery. No coward would dare that. Many a notorious coward,\r\nmany a chicken-livered poltroon, coarse, brutal, degraded, has made his\r\ndying speech without a quaver in his voice and been swung into eternity\r\nwith what looked liked the calmest fortitude, and so we are justified in\r\nbelieving, from the low intellect of such a creature, that it was not\r\n_moral_ courage that enabled him to do it. Then, if moral courage is not\r\nthe requisite quality, what could it have been that this stout-hearted\r\nSlade lacked?\xe2\x80\x94this bloody, desperate, kindly-mannered, urbane gentleman,\r\nwho never hesitated to warn his most ruffianly enemies that he would\r\nkill them whenever or wherever he came across them next! I think it is a\r\nconundrum worth investigating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust beyond the breakfast-station we overtook a Mormon emigrant train of\r\nthirty-three wagons; and tramping wearily along and driving their herd\r\nof loose cows, were dozens of coarse-clad and sad-looking men, women and\r\nchildren, who had walked as they were walking now, day after day for\r\neight lingering weeks, and in that time had compassed the distance our\r\nstage had come in _eight days and three hours_\xe2\x80\x94seven hundred and ninety-\r\neight miles! They were dusty and uncombed, hatless, bonnetless and\r\nragged, and they did look so tired!\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, we bathed in Horse Creek, a (previously) limpid,\r\nsparkling stream\xe2\x80\x94an appreciated luxury, for it was very seldom that our\r\nfurious coach halted long enough for an indulgence of that kind. We\r\nchanged horses ten or twelve times in every twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x94changed\r\nmules, rather\xe2\x80\x94six mules\xe2\x80\x94and did it nearly every time in _four minutes_.\r\nIt was lively work. As our coach rattled up to each station six\r\nharnessed mules stepped gayly from the stable; and in the twinkling of\r\nan eye, almost, the old team was out, and the new one in and we off and\r\naway again.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon we passed Sweetwater Creek, Independence Rock,\r\nDevil\xe2\x80\x99s Gate and the Devil\xe2\x80\x99s Gap. The latter were wild specimens of\r\nrugged scenery, and full of interest\xe2\x80\x94_we were in the heart of the Rocky\r\nMountains, now_. And we also passed by \xe2\x80\x9cAlkali\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cSoda Lake,\xe2\x80\x9d and we\r\nwoke up to the fact that our journey had stretched a long way across the\r\nworld when the driver said that the Mormons often came there from Great\r\nSalt Lake City to haul away saleratus. He said that a few days gone by\r\nthey had shoveled up enough pure saleratus from the ground (it was a\r\n_dry_ lake) to load two wagons, and that when they got these two wagons-\r\nloads of a drug that cost them nothing, to Salt Lake, they could sell it\r\nfor twenty-five cents a pound.\r\n\r\nIn the night we sailed by a most notable curiosity, and one we had been\r\nhearing a good deal about for a day or two, and were suffering to see.\r\nThis was what might be called a natural ice-house. It was August, now,\r\nand sweltering weather in the daytime, yet at one of the stations the\r\nmen could scape the soil on the hill-side under the lee of a range of\r\nboulders, and at a depth of six inches cut out pure blocks of ice\xe2\x80\x94hard,\r\ncompactly frozen, and clear as crystal!\r\n\r\nToward dawn we got under way again, and presently as we sat with raised\r\ncurtains enjoying our early-morning smoke and contemplating the first\r\nsplendor of the rising sun as it swept down the long array of mountain\r\npeaks, flushing and gilding crag after crag and summit after summit, as\r\nif the invisible Creator reviewed his gray veterans and they saluted\r\nwith a smile, we hove in sight of South Pass City. The hotel-keeper, the\r\npostmaster, the blacksmith, the mayor, the constable, the city marshal\r\nand the principal citizen and property holder, all came out and greeted\r\nus cheerily, and we gave him good day. He gave us a little Indian news,\r\nand a little Rocky Mountain news, and we gave him some Plains\r\ninformation in return. He then retired to his lonely grandeur and we\r\nclimbed on up among the bristling peaks and the ragged clouds. South\r\nPass City consisted of four log cabins, one if which was unfinished, and\r\nthe gentleman with all those offices and titles was the chiefest of the\r\nten citizens of the place. Think of hotel-keeper, postmaster,\r\nblacksmith, mayor, constable, city marshal and principal citizen all\r\ncondensed into one person and crammed into one skin. Bemis said he was\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ca perfect Allen\xe2\x80\x99s revolver of dignities.\xe2\x80\x9d And he said that if he were\r\nto die as postmaster, or as blacksmith, or as postmaster and blacksmith\r\nboth, the people might stand it; but if he were to die all over, it\r\nwould be a frightful loss to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n099.jpg (57K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo miles beyond South Pass City we saw for the first time that\r\nmysterious marvel which all Western untraveled boys have heard of and\r\nfully believe in, but are sure to be astounded at when they see it with\r\ntheir own eyes, nevertheless\xe2\x80\x94banks of snow in dead summer time. We were\r\nnow far up toward the sky, and knew all the time that we must presently\r\nencounter lofty summits clad in the \xe2\x80\x9ceternal snow\xe2\x80\x9d which was so common\r\nplace a matter of mention in books, and yet when I did see it glittering\r\nin the sun on stately domes in the distance and knew the month was\r\nAugust and that my coat was hanging up because it was too warm to wear\r\nit, I was full as much amazed as if I never had heard of snow in August\r\nbefore. Truly, \xe2\x80\x9cseeing is believing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and many a man lives a long life\r\nthrough, thinking he believes certain universally received and well\r\nestablished things, and yet never suspects that if he were confronted by\r\nthose things once, he would discover that he did not really believe them\r\nbefore, but only thought he believed them.\r\n\r\nIn a little while quite a number of peaks swung into view with long\r\nclaws of glittering snow clasping them; and with here and there, in the\r\nshade, down the mountain side, a little solitary patch of snow looking\r\nno larger than a lady\xe2\x80\x99s pocket-handkerchief but being in reality as\r\nlarge as a \xe2\x80\x9cpublic square.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd now, at last, we were fairly in the renowned SOUTH PASS, and\r\nwhirling gayly along high above the common world. We were perched upon\r\nthe extreme summit of the great range of the Rocky Mountains, toward\r\nwhich we had been climbing, patiently climbing, ceaselessly climbing,\r\nfor days and nights together\xe2\x80\x94and about us was gathered a convention of\r\nNature\xe2\x80\x99s kings that stood ten, twelve, and even thirteen thousand feet\r\nhigh\xe2\x80\x94grand old fellows who would have to stoop to see Mount Washington,\r\nin the twilight. We were in such an airy elevation above the creeping\r\npopulations of the earth, that now and then when the obstructing crags\r\nstood out of the way it seemed that we could look around and abroad and\r\ncontemplate the whole great globe, with its dissolving views of\r\nmountains, seas and continents stretching away through the mystery of\r\nthe summer haze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n100.jpg (164K)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general thing the Pass was more suggestive of a valley than a\r\nsuspension bridge in the clouds\xe2\x80\x94but it strongly suggested the latter at\r\none spot. At that place the upper third of one or two majestic purple\r\ndomes projected above our level on either hand and gave us a sense of a\r\nhidden great deep of mountains and plains and valleys down about their\r\nbases which we fancied we might see if we could step to the edge and\r\nlook over. These Sultans of the fastnesses were turbaned with tumbled\r\nvolumes of cloud, which shredded away from time to time and drifted off\r\nfringed and torn, trailing their continents of shadow after them; and\r\ncatching presently on an intercepting peak, wrapped it about and brooded\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x94then shredded away again and left the purple peak, as they had\r\nleft the purple domes, downy and white with new-laid snow. In passing,\r\nthese monstrous rags of cloud hung low and swept along right over the\r\nspectator\xe2\x80\x99s head, swinging their tatters so nearly in his face that his\r\nimpulse was to shrink when they came closest. In the one place I speak\r\nof, one could look below him upon a world of diminishing crags and\r\ncanyons leading down, down, and away to a vague plain with a thread in\r\nit which was a road, and bunches of feathers in it which were trees,\xe2\x80\x94a\r\npretty picture sleeping in the sunlight\xe2\x80\x94but with a darkness stealing\r\nover it and glooming its features deeper and deeper under the frown of a\r\ncoming storm; and then, while no film or shadow marred the noon\r\nbrightness of his high perch, he could watch the tempest break forth\r\ndown there and see the lightnings leap from crag to crag and the sheeted\r\nrain drive along the canyon-sides, and hear the thunders peal and crash\r\nand roar. We had this spectacle; a familiar one to many, but to us a\r\nnovelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n101.jpg (164K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe bowled along cheerily, and presently, at the very summit (though it\r\nhad been all summit to us, and all equally level, for half an hour or\r\nmore), we came to a spring which spent its water through two outlets and\r\nsent it in opposite directions. The conductor said that one of those\r\nstreams which we were looking at, was just starting on a journey\r\nwestward to the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean, through\r\nhundreds and even thousands of miles of desert solitudes. He said that\r\nthe other was just leaving its home among the snow-peaks on a similar\r\njourney eastward\xe2\x80\x94and we knew that long after we should have forgotten\r\nthe simple rivulet it would still be plodding its patient way down the\r\nmountain sides, and canyon-beds, and between the banks of the\r\nYellowstone; and by and by would join the broad Missouri and flow\r\nthrough unknown plains and deserts and unvisited wildernesses; and add a\r\nlong and troubled pilgrimage among snags and wrecks and sandbars; and\r\nenter the Mississippi, touch the wharves of St. Louis and still drift\r\non, traversing shoals and rocky channels, then endless chains of\r\nbottomless and ample bends, walled with unbroken forests, then\r\nmysterious byways and secret passages among woody islands, then the\r\nchained bends again, bordered with wide levels of shining sugar-cane in\r\nplace of the sombre forests; then by New Orleans and still other chains\r\nof bends\xe2\x80\x94and finally, after two long months of daily and nightly\r\nharassment, excitement, enjoyment, adventure, and awful peril of parched\r\nthroats, pumps and evaporation, pass the Gulf and enter into its rest\r\nupon the bosom of the tropic sea, never to look upon its snow-peaks\r\nagain or regret them.\r\n\r\nI freighted a leaf with a mental message for the friends at home, and\r\ndropped it in the stream. But I put no stamp on it and it was held for\r\npostage somewhere.\r\n\r\nOn the summit we overtook an emigrant train of many wagons, many tired\r\nmen and women, and many a disgusted sheep and cow.\r\n\r\nIn the wofully dusty horseman in charge of the expedition I recognized\r\nJohn \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94. Of all persons in the world to meet on top of the Rocky\r\nMountains thousands of miles from home, he was the last one I should\r\nhave looked for. We were school-boys together and warm friends for\r\nyears. But a boyish prank of mine had disruptured this friendship and it\r\nhad never been renewed. The act of which I speak was this. I had been\r\naccustomed to visit occasionally an editor whose room was in the third\r\nstory of a building and overlooked the street. One day this editor gave\r\nme a watermelon which I made preparations to devour on the spot, but\r\nchancing to look out of the window, I saw John standing directly under\r\nit and an irresistible desire came upon me to drop the melon on his\r\nhead, which I immediately did. I was the loser, for it spoiled the\r\nmelon, and John never forgave me and we dropped all intercourse and\r\nparted, but now met again under these circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102.jpg (41K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recognized each other simultaneously, and hands were grasped as\r\nwarmly as if no coldness had ever existed between us, and no allusion\r\nwas made to any. All animosities were buried and the simple fact of\r\nmeeting a familiar face in that isolated spot so far from home, was\r\nsufficient to make us forget all things but pleasant ones, and we parted\r\nagain with sincere \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you\xe2\x80\x9d from both.\r\n\r\nWe had been climbing up the long shoulders of the Rocky Mountains for\r\nmany tedious hours\xe2\x80\x94we started _down_ them, now. And we went spinning\r\naway at a round rate too.\r\n\r\nWe left the snowy Wind River Mountains and Uinta Mountains behind, and\r\nsped away, always through splendid scenery but occasionally through long\r\nranks of white skeletons of mules and oxen\xe2\x80\x94monuments of the huge\r\nemigration of other days\xe2\x80\x94and here and there were up-ended boards or\r\nsmall piles of stones which the driver said marked the resting-place of\r\nmore precious remains.\r\n\r\nIt was the loneliest land for a grave! A land given over to the cayote\r\nand the raven\xe2\x80\x94which is but another name for desolation and utter\r\nsolitude. On damp, murky nights, these scattered skeletons gave forth a\r\nsoft, hideous glow, like very faint spots of moonlight starring the\r\nvague desert. It was because of the phosphorus in the bones. But no\r\nscientific explanation could keep a body from shivering when he drifted\r\nby one of those ghostly lights and knew that a skull held it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n103.jpg (35K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt midnight it began to rain, and I never saw anything like it\xe2\x80\x94indeed, I\r\ndid not even see this, for it was too dark. We fastened down the\r\ncurtains and even caulked them with clothing, but the rain streamed in\r\nin twenty places, nothwithstanding. There was no escape. If one moved\r\nhis feet out of a stream, he brought his body under one; and if he moved\r\nhis body he caught one somewhere else. If he struggled out of the\r\ndrenched blankets and sat up, he was bound to get one down the back of\r\nhis neck. Meantime the stage was wandering about a plain with gaping\r\ngullies in it, for the driver could not see an inch before his face nor\r\nkeep the road, and the storm pelted so pitilessly that there was no\r\nkeeping the horses still. With the first abatement the conductor turned\r\nout with lanterns to look for the road, and the first dash he made was\r\ninto a chasm about fourteen feet deep, his lantern following like a\r\nmeteor. As soon as he touched bottom he sang out frantically:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n104.jpg (30K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t come here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo which the driver, who was looking over the precipice where he had\r\ndisappeared, replied, with an injured air: \xe2\x80\x9cThink I\xe2\x80\x99m a dam fool?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n105.jpg (30K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conductor was more than an hour finding the road\xe2\x80\x94a matter which\r\nshowed us how far we had wandered and what chances we had been taking.\r\nHe traced our wheel-tracks to the imminent verge of danger, in two\r\nplaces. I have always been glad that we were not killed that night. I do\r\nnot know any particular reason, but I have always been glad. In the\r\nmorning, the tenth day out, we crossed Green River, a fine, large,\r\nlimpid stream\xe2\x80\x94stuck in it with the water just up to the top of our mail-\r\nbed, and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep\r\nbank. But it was nice cool water, and besides it could not find any\r\nfresh place on us to wet.\r\n\r\nAt the Green River station we had breakfast\xe2\x80\x94hot biscuits, fresh antelope\r\nsteaks, and coffee\xe2\x80\x94the only decent meal we tasted between the United\r\nStates and Great Salt Lake City, and the only one we were ever really\r\nthankful for.\r\n\r\nThink of the monotonous execrableness of the thirty that went before it,\r\nto leave this one simple breakfast looming up in my memory like a shot-\r\ntower after all these years have gone by!\r\n\r\nAt five P.M. we reached Fort Bridger, one hundred and seventeen miles\r\nfrom the South Pass, and one thousand and twenty-five miles from St.\r\nJoseph. Fifty-two miles further on, near the head of Echo Canyon, we met\r\nsixty United States soldiers from Camp Floyd. The day before, they had\r\nfired upon three hundred or four hundred Indians, whom they supposed\r\ngathered together for no good purpose. In the fight that had ensued,\r\nfour Indians were captured, and the main body chased four miles, but\r\nnobody killed. This looked like business. We had a notion to get out and\r\njoin the sixty soldiers, but upon reflecting that there were four\r\nhundred of the Indians, we concluded to go on and join the Indians.\r\n\r\nEcho Canyon is twenty miles long. It was like a long, smooth, narrow\r\nstreet, with a gradual descending grade, and shut in by enormous\r\nperpendicular walls of coarse conglomerate, four hundred feet high in\r\nmany places, and turreted like mediaeval castles. This was the most\r\nfaultless piece of road in the mountains, and the driver said he would\r\n\xe2\x80\x9clet his team out.\xe2\x80\x9d He did, and if the Pacific express trains whiz\r\nthrough there now any faster than we did then in the stage-coach, I envy\r\nthe passengers the exhilaration of it. We fairly seemed to pick up our\r\nwheels and fly\xe2\x80\x94and the mail matter was lifted up free from everything\r\nand held in solution! I am not given to exaggeration, and when I say a\r\nthing I mean it.\r\n\r\nHowever, time presses. At four in the afternoon we arrived on the summit\r\nof Big Mountain, fifteen miles from Salt Lake City, when all the world\r\nwas glorified with the setting sun, and the most stupendous panorama of\r\nmountain peaks yet encountered burst on our sight. We looked out upon\r\nthis sublime spectacle from under the arch of a brilliant rainbow! Even\r\nthe overland stage-driver stopped his horses and gazed!\r\n\r\nHalf an hour or an hour later, we changed horses, and took supper with a\r\nMormon \xe2\x80\x9cDestroying Angel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDestroying Angels,\xe2\x80\x9d as I understand it, are Latter-Day Saints who are\r\nset apart by the Church to conduct permanent disappearances of obnoxious\r\ncitizens. I had heard a deal about these Mormon Destroying Angels and\r\nthe dark and bloody deeds they had done, and when I entered this one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse I had my shudder all ready. But alas for all our romances, he was\r\nnothing but a loud, profane, offensive, old blackguard! He was murderous\r\nenough, possibly, to fill the bill of a Destroyer, but would you have\r\n_any_ kind of an Angel devoid of dignity? Could you abide an Angel in an\r\nunclean shirt and no suspenders? Could you respect an Angel with a\r\nhorse-laugh and a swagger like a buccaneer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n106.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were other blackguards present\xe2\x80\x94comrades of this one. And there was\r\none person that looked like a gentleman\xe2\x80\x94Heber C. Kimball\xe2\x80\x99s son, tall and\r\nwell made, and thirty years old, perhaps. A lot of slatternly women\r\nflitted hither and thither in a hurry, with coffee-pots, plates of\r\nbread, and other appurtenances to supper, and these were said to be the\r\nwives of the Angel\xe2\x80\x94or some of them, at least. And of course they were;\r\nfor if they had been hired \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d they would not have let an angel from\r\nabove storm and swear at them as he did, let alone one from the place\r\nthis one hailed from.\r\n\r\nThis was our first experience of the western \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar institution,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nit was not very prepossessing. We did not tarry long to observe it, but\r\nhurried on to the home of the Latter-Day Saints, the stronghold of the\r\nprophets, the capital of the only absolute monarch in America\xe2\x80\x94Great Salt\r\nLake City. As the night closed in we took sanctuary in the Salt Lake\r\nHouse and unpacked our baggage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had a fine supper, of the freshest meats and fowls and vegetables\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngreat variety and as great abundance. We walked about the streets some,\r\nafterward, and glanced in at shops and stores; and there was fascination\r\nin surreptitiously staring at every creature we took to be a Mormon.\r\nThis was fairy-land to us, to all intents and purposes\xe2\x80\x94a land of\r\nenchantment, and goblins, and awful mystery. We felt a curiosity to ask\r\nevery child how many mothers it had, and if it could tell them apart;\r\nand we experienced a thrill every time a dwelling-house door opened and\r\nshut as we passed, disclosing a glimpse of human heads and backs and\r\nshoulders\xe2\x80\x94for we so longed to have a good satisfying look at a Mormon\r\nfamily in all its comprehensive ampleness, disposed in the customary\r\nconcentric rings of its home circle.\r\n\r\nBy and by the Acting Governor of the Territory introduced us to other\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentiles,\xe2\x80\x9d and we spent a sociable hour with them. \xe2\x80\x9cGentiles\xe2\x80\x9d are\r\npeople who are not Mormons. Our fellow-passenger, Bemis, took care of\r\nhimself, during this part of the evening, and did not make an\r\noverpowering success of it, either, for he came into our room in the\r\nhotel about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, full of cheerfulness, and talking loosely,\r\ndisjointedly and indiscriminately, and every now and then tugging out a\r\nragged word by the roots that had more hiccups than syllables in it.\r\nThis, together with his hanging his coat on the floor on one side of a\r\nchair, and his vest on the floor on the other side, and piling his pants\r\non the floor just in front of the same chair, and then comtemplating the\r\ngeneral result with superstitious awe, and finally pronouncing it \xe2\x80\x9ctoo\r\nmany for _him_\xe2\x80\x9d and going to bed with his boots on, led us to fear that\r\nsomething he had eaten had not agreed with him.\r\n\r\nBut we knew afterward that it was something he had been drinking. It was\r\nthe exclusively Mormon refresher, \xe2\x80\x9cvalley tan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nValley tan (or, at least, one form of valley tan) is a kind of whisky,\r\nor first cousin to it; is of Mormon invention and manufactured only in\r\nUtah. Tradition says it is made of (imported) fire and brimstone. If I\r\nremember rightly no public drinking saloons were allowed in the kingdom\r\nby Brigham Young, and no private drinking permitted among the faithful,\r\nexcept they confined themselves to \xe2\x80\x9cvalley tan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n109.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day we strolled about everywhere through the broad, straight, level\r\nstreets, and enjoyed the pleasant strangeness of a city of fifteen\r\nthousand inhabitants with no loafers perceptible in it; and no visible\r\ndrunkards or noisy people; a limpid stream rippling and dancing through\r\nevery street in place of a filthy gutter; block after block of trim\r\ndwellings, built of \xe2\x80\x9cframe\xe2\x80\x9d and sunburned brick\xe2\x80\x94a great thriving orchard\r\nand garden behind every one of them, apparently\xe2\x80\x94branches from the street\r\nstream winding and sparkling among the garden beds and fruit trees\xe2\x80\x94and a\r\ngrand general air of neatness, repair, thrift and comfort, around and\r\nabout and over the whole. And everywhere were workshops, factories, and\r\nall manner of industries; and intent faces and busy hands were to be\r\nseen wherever one looked; and in one\xe2\x80\x99s ears was the ceaseless clink of\r\nhammers, the buzz of trade and the contented hum of drums and fly-\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n110a.jpg (25K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe armorial crest of my own State consisted of two dissolute bears\r\nholding up the head of a dead and gone cask between them and making the\r\npertinent remark, \xe2\x80\x9cUNITED, WE STAND\xe2\x80\x94(hic!)\xe2\x80\x94DIVIDED, WE FALL.\xe2\x80\x9d It was\r\nalways too figurative for the author of this book. But the Mormon crest\r\nwas easy. And it was simple, unostentatious, and fitted like a glove. It\r\nwas a representation of a GOLDEN BEEHIVE, with the bees all at work!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n110b.jpg (23K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city lies in the edge of a level plain as broad as the State of\r\nConnecticut, and crouches close down to the ground under a curving wall\r\nof mighty mountains whose heads are hidden in the clouds, and whose\r\nshoulders bear relics of the snows of winter all the summer long.\r\n\r\nSeen from one of these dizzy heights, twelve or fifteen miles off, Great\r\nSalt Lake City is toned down and diminished till it is suggestive of a\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s toy-village reposing under the majestic protection of the\r\nChinese wall.\r\n\r\nOn some of those mountains, to the southwest, it had been raining every\r\nday for two weeks, but not a drop had fallen in the city. And on hot\r\ndays in late spring and early autumn the citizens could quit fanning and\r\ngrowling and go out and cool off by looking at the luxury of a glorious\r\nsnow-storm going on in the mountains. They could enjoy it at a distance,\r\nat those seasons, every day, though no snow would fall in their streets,\r\nor anywhere near them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n111.jpg (83K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City was healthy\xe2\x80\x94an extremely healthy city. They declared\r\nthere was only one physician in the place and he was arrested every week\r\nregularly and held to answer under the vagrant act for having \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\nvisible means of support.\xe2\x80\x9d They always give you a good substantial\r\narticle of truth in Salt Lake, and good measure and good weight, too.\r\n[Very often, if you wished to weigh one of their airiest little\r\ncommonplace statements you would want the hay scales.]\r\n\r\nWe desired to visit the famous inland sea, the American \xe2\x80\x9cDead Sea,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ngreat Salt Lake\xe2\x80\x94seventeen miles, horseback, from the city\xe2\x80\x94for we had\r\ndreamed about it, and thought about it, and talked about it, and yearned\r\nto see it, all the first part of our trip; but now when it was only\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length away it had suddenly lost nearly every bit of its interest.\r\nAnd so we put it off, in a sort of general way, till next day\xe2\x80\x94and that\r\nwas the last we ever thought of it. We dined with some hospitable\r\nGentiles; and visited the foundation of the prodigious temple; and\r\ntalked long with that shrewd Connecticut Yankee, Heber C. Kimball (since\r\ndeceased), a saint of high degree and a mighty man of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n112.jpg (21K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe saw the \xe2\x80\x9cTithing-House,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cLion House,\xe2\x80\x9d and I do not know or\r\nremember how many more church and government buildings of various kinds\r\nand curious names. We flitted hither and thither and enjoyed every hour,\r\nand picked up a great deal of useful information and entertaining\r\nnonsense, and went to bed at night satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe second day, we made the acquaintance of Mr. Street (since deceased)\r\nand put on white shirts and went and paid a state visit to the king. He\r\nseemed a quiet, kindly, easy-mannered, dignified, self-possessed old\r\ngentleman of fifty-five or sixty, and had a gentle craft in his eye that\r\nprobably belonged there. He was very simply dressed and was just taking\r\noff a straw hat as we entered. He talked about Utah, and the Indians,\r\nand Nevada, and general American matters and questions, with our\r\nsecretary and certain government officials who came with us. But he\r\nnever paid any attention to me, notwithstanding I made several attempts\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cdraw him out\xe2\x80\x9d on federal politics and his high handed attitude\r\ntoward Congress. I thought some of the things I said were rather fine.\r\nBut he merely looked around at me, at distant intervals, something as I\r\nhave seen a benignant old cat look around to see which kitten was\r\nmeddling with her tail.\r\n\r\nBy and by I subsided into an indignant silence, and so sat until the\r\nend, hot and flushed, and execrating him in my heart for an ignorant\r\nsavage. But he was calm. His conversation with those gentlemen flowed on\r\nas sweetly and peacefully and musically as any summer brook. When the\r\naudience was ended and we were retiring from the presence, he put his\r\nhand on my head, beamed down on me in an admiring way and said to my\r\nbrother:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94your child, I presume? Boy, or girl?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n113.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Street was very busy with his telegraphic matters\xe2\x80\x94and considering\r\nthat he had eight or nine hundred miles of rugged, snowy, uninhabited\r\nmountains, and waterless, treeless, melancholy deserts to traverse with\r\nhis wire, it was natural and needful that he should be as busy as\r\npossible. He could not go comfortably along and cut his poles by the\r\nroad-side, either, but they had to be hauled by ox teams across those\r\nexhausting deserts\xe2\x80\x94and it was two days\xe2\x80\x99 journey from water to water, in\r\none or two of them. Mr. Street\xe2\x80\x99s contract was a vast work, every way one\r\nlooked at it; and yet to comprehend what the vague words \xe2\x80\x9ceight hundred\r\nmiles of rugged mountains and dismal deserts\xe2\x80\x9d mean, one must go over the\r\nground in person\xe2\x80\x94pen and ink descriptions cannot convey the dreary\r\nreality to the reader. And after all, Mr. S.\xe2\x80\x99s mightiest difficulty\r\nturned out to be one which he had never taken into the account at all.\r\nUnto Mormons he had sub-let the hardest and heaviest half of his great\r\nundertaking, and all of a sudden they concluded that they were going to\r\nmake little or nothing, and so they tranquilly threw their poles\r\noverboard in mountain or desert, just as it happened when they took the\r\nnotion, and drove home and went about their customary business! They\r\nwere under written contract to Mr. Street, but they did not care\r\nanything for that. They said they would \xe2\x80\x9cadmire\xe2\x80\x9d to see a \xe2\x80\x9cGentile\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nforce a Mormon to fulfil a losing contract in Utah! And they made\r\nthemselves very merry over the matter. Street said\xe2\x80\x94for it was he that\r\ntold us these things:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was in dismay. I was under heavy bonds to complete my contract in a\r\ngiven time, and this disaster looked very much like ruin. It was an\r\nastounding thing; it was such a wholly unlooked-for difficulty, that I\r\nwas entirely nonplussed. I am a business man\xe2\x80\x94have always been a business\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94do not know anything _but_ business\xe2\x80\x94and so you can imagine how like\r\nbeing struck by lightning it was to find myself in a country _where\r\nwritten contracts were worthless!_\xe2\x80\x94that main security, that sheet-\r\nanchor, that absolute necessity, of business. My confidence left me.\r\nThere was no use in making new contracts\xe2\x80\x94that was plain. I talked with\r\nfirst one prominent citizen and then another. They all sympathized with\r\nme, first rate, but they did not know how to help me. But at last a\r\nGentile said, \xe2\x80\x98Go to Brigham Young!\xe2\x80\x94these small fry cannot do you any\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x99 I did not think much of the idea, for if the _law_ could not help\r\nme, what could an individual do who had not even anything to do with\r\neither making the laws or executing them? He might be a very good\r\npatriarch of a church and preacher in its tabernacle, but something\r\nsterner than religion and moral suasion was needed to handle a hundred\r\nrefractory, half-civilized sub-contractors. But what was a man to do? I\r\nthought if Mr. Young could not do anything else, he might probably be\r\nable to give me some advice and a valuable hint or two, and so I went\r\nstraight to him and laid the whole case before him. He said very little,\r\nbut he showed strong interest all the way through. He examined all the\r\npapers in detail, and whenever there seemed anything like a hitch,\r\neither in the papers or my statement, he would go back and take up the\r\nthread and follow it patiently out to an intelligent and satisfactory\r\nresult. Then he made a list of the contractors\xe2\x80\x99 names. Finally he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Street, this is all perfectly plain. These contracts are strictly\r\nand legally drawn, and are duly signed and certified. These men\r\nmanifestly entered into them with their eyes open. I see no fault or\r\nflaw anywhere.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen Mr. Young turned to a man waiting at the other end of the room and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Take this list of names to So-and-so, and tell him to have these\r\nmen here at such-and-such an hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were there, to the minute. So was I. Mr. Young asked them a number\r\nof questions, and their answers made my statement good. Then he said to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You signed these contracts and assumed these obligations of your own\r\nfree will and accord?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Then carry them out to the letter, if it makes paupers of you! Go!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n116.jpg (101K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they _did_ go, too! They are strung across the deserts now, working\r\nlike bees. And I never hear a word out of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a batch of governors, and judges, and other officials here,\r\nshipped from Washington, and they maintain the semblance of a republican\r\nform of government\xe2\x80\x94but the petrified truth is that Utah is an absolute\r\nmonarchy and Brigham Young is king!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Street was a fine man, and I believe his story. I knew him well\r\nduring several years afterward in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOur stay in Salt Lake City amounted to only two days, and therefore we\r\nhad no time to make the customary inquisition into the workings of\r\npolygamy and get up the usual statistics and deductions preparatory to\r\ncalling the attention of the nation at large once more to the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n117.jpg (104K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had the will to do it. With the gushing self-sufficiency of youth I\r\nwas feverish to plunge in headlong and achieve a great reform here\xe2\x80\x94until\r\nI saw the Mormon women. Then I was touched. My heart was wiser than my\r\nhead. It warmed toward these poor, ungainly and pathetically \xe2\x80\x9chomely\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ncreatures, and as I turned to hide the generous moisture in my eyes, I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94the man that marries one of them has done an act of Christian\r\ncharity which entitles him to the kindly applause of mankind, not their\r\nharsh censure\xe2\x80\x94and the man that marries sixty of them has done a deed of\r\nopen-handed generosity so sublime that the nations should stand\r\nuncovered in his presence and worship in silence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n[For a brief sketch of Mormon history, and the noted Mountain Meadow\r\nmassacre, see Appendices A and B. ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n118.jpg (82K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a luscious country for thrilling evening stories about\r\nassassinations of intractable Gentiles. I cannot easily conceive of\r\nanything more cosy than the night in Salt Lake which we spent in a\r\nGentile den, smoking pipes and listening to tales of how Burton galloped\r\nin among the pleading and defenceless \xe2\x80\x9cMorisites\xe2\x80\x9d and shot them down,\r\nmen and women, like so many dogs. And how Bill Hickman, a Destroying\r\nAngel, shot Drown and Arnold dead for bringing suit against him for a\r\ndebt. And how Porter Rockwell did this and that dreadful thing. And how\r\nheedless people often come to Utah and make remarks about Brigham, or\r\npolygamy, or some other sacred matter, and the very next morning at\r\ndaylight such parties are sure to be found lying up some back alley,\r\ncontentedly waiting for the hearse.\r\n\r\nAnd the next most interesting thing is to sit and listen to these\r\nGentiles talk about polygamy; and how some portly old frog of an elder,\r\nor a bishop, marries a girl\xe2\x80\x94likes her, marries her sister\xe2\x80\x94likes her,\r\nmarries another sister\xe2\x80\x94likes her, takes another\xe2\x80\x94likes her, marries her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x94likes her, marries her father, grandfather, great grandfather,\r\nand then comes back hungry and asks for more. And how the pert young\r\nthing of eleven will chance to be the favorite wife and her own\r\nvenerable grandmother have to rank away down toward D 4 in their mutual\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s esteem, and have to sleep in the kitchen, as like as not. And\r\nhow this dreadful sort of thing, this hiving together in one foul nest\r\nof mother and daughters, and the making a young daughter superior to her\r\nown mother in rank and authority, are things which Mormon women submit\r\nto because their religion teaches them that the more wives a man has on\r\nearth, and the more children he rears, the higher the place they will\r\nall have in the world to come\xe2\x80\x94and the warmer, maybe, though they do not\r\nseem to say anything about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n120.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to these Gentile friends of ours, Brigham Young\xe2\x80\x99s harem\r\ncontains twenty or thirty wives. They said that some of them had grown\r\nold and gone out of active service, but were comfortably housed and\r\ncared for in the henery\xe2\x80\x94or the Lion House, as it is strangely named.\r\nAlong with each wife were her children\xe2\x80\x94fifty altogether. The house was\r\nperfectly quiet and orderly, when the children were still. They all took\r\ntheir meals in one room, and a happy and home-like sight it was\r\npronounced to be. None of our party got an opportunity to take dinner\r\nwith Mr. Young, but a Gentile by the name of Johnson professed to have\r\nenjoyed a sociable breakfast in the Lion House. He gave a preposterous\r\naccount of the \xe2\x80\x9ccalling of the roll,\xe2\x80\x9d and other preliminaries, and the\r\ncarnage that ensued when the buckwheat cakes came in. But he embellished\r\nrather too much. He said that Mr. Young told him several smart sayings\r\nof certain of his \xe2\x80\x9ctwo-year-olds,\xe2\x80\x9d observing with some pride that for\r\nmany years he had been the heaviest contributor in that line to one of\r\nthe Eastern magazines; and then he wanted to show Mr. Johnson one of the\r\npets that had said the last good thing, but he could not find the child.\r\n\r\nHe searched the faces of the children in detail, but could not decide\r\nwhich one it was. Finally he gave it up with a sigh and said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n121.jpg (86K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I would know the little cub again but I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Johnson\r\nsaid further, that Mr. Young observed that life was a sad, sad\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbecause the joy of every new marriage a man contracted was so apt\r\nto be blighted by the inopportune funeral of a less recent bride.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nMr. Johnson said that while he and Mr. Young were pleasantly conversing\r\nin private, one of the Mrs. Youngs came in and demanded a breast-pin,\r\nremarking that she had found out that he had been giving a breast-pin to\r\nNo. 6, and _she_, for one, did not propose to let this partiality go on\r\nwithout making a satisfactory amount of trouble about it. Mr. Young\r\nreminded her that there was a stranger present. Mrs. Young said that if\r\nthe state of things inside the house was not agreeable to the stranger,\r\nhe could find room outside. Mr. Young promised the breast-pin, and she\r\nwent away. But in a minute or two another Mrs. Young came in and\r\ndemanded a breast-pin. Mr. Young began a remonstrance, but Mrs. Young\r\ncut him short. She said No. 6 had got one, and No. 11 was promised one,\r\nand it was \xe2\x80\x9cno use for him to try to impose on her\xe2\x80\x94she hoped she knew\r\nher rights.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave his promise, and she went. And presently three Mrs.\r\nYoungs entered in a body and opened on their husband a tempest of tears,\r\nabuse, and entreaty. They had heard all about No. 6, No. 11, and No. 14.\r\nThree more breast-pins were promised. They were hardly gone when nine\r\nmore Mrs. Youngs filed into the presence, and a new tempest burst forth\r\nand raged round about the prophet and his guest. Nine breast-pins were\r\npromised, and the weird sisters filed out again. And in came eleven\r\nmore, weeping and wailing and gnashing their teeth. Eleven promised\r\nbreast-pins purchased peace once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Young. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see how it is. You see what a\r\nlife I lead. A man _can\xe2\x80\x99t_ be wise all the time. In a heedless moment I\r\ngave my darling No. 6\xe2\x80\x94excuse my calling her thus, as her other name has\r\nescaped me for the moment\xe2\x80\x94a breast-pin. It was only worth twenty-five\r\ndollars\xe2\x80\x94that is, _apparently_ that was its _whole_ cost\xe2\x80\x94but its ultimate\r\ncost was inevitably bound to be a good deal more. You yourself have seen\r\nit climb up to six hundred and fifty dollars\xe2\x80\x94and alas, even that is not\r\nthe end! For I have wives all over this Territory of Utah. I have dozens\r\nof wives whose _numbers_, even, I do not know without looking in the\r\nfamily Bible. They are scattered far and wide among the mountains and\r\nvalleys of my realm. And mark you, every solitary one of them will hear\r\nof this wretched breast pin, and every last one of them will have one or\r\ndie. No. 6\xe2\x80\x99s breast pin will cost me twenty-five hundred dollars before\r\nI see the end of it. And these creatures will compare these pins\r\ntogether, and if one is a shade finer than the rest, they will all be\r\nthrown on my hands, and I will have to order a new lot to keep peace in\r\nthe family. Sir, you probably did not know it, but all the time you were\r\npresent with my children your every movement was watched by vigilant\r\nservitors of mine. If you had offered to give a child a dime, or a stick\r\nof candy, or any trifle of the kind, you would have been snatched out of\r\nthe house instantly, provided it could be done before your gift left\r\nyour hand. Otherwise it would be absolutely necessary for you to make an\r\nexactly similar gift to all my children\xe2\x80\x94and knowing by experience the\r\nimportance of the thing, I would have stood by and seen to it myself\r\nthat you did it, and did it thoroughly. Once a gentleman gave one of my\r\nchildren a tin whistle\xe2\x80\x94a veritable invention of Satan, sir, and one\r\nwhich I have an unspeakable horror of, and so would you if you had\r\neighty or ninety children in your house. But the deed was done\xe2\x80\x94the man\r\nescaped. I knew what the result was going to be, and I thirsted for\r\nvengeance. I ordered out a flock of Destroying Angels, and they hunted\r\nthe man far into the fastnesses of the Nevada mountains. But they never\r\ncaught him. I am not cruel, sir\xe2\x80\x94I am not vindictive except when sorely\r\noutraged\xe2\x80\x94but if I had caught him, sir, so help me Joseph Smith, I would\r\nhave locked him into the nursery till the brats whistled him to death.\r\nBy the slaughtered body of St. Parley Pratt (whom God assoil!) there was\r\nnever anything on this earth like it! _I_ knew who gave the whistle to\r\nthe child, but I could, not make those jealous mothers believe me. They\r\nbelieved _I_ did it, and the result was just what any man of reflection\r\ncould have foreseen: I had to order a hundred and ten whistles\xe2\x80\x94I think\r\nwe had a hundred and ten children in the house then, but some of them\r\nare off at college now\xe2\x80\x94I had to order a hundred and ten of those\r\nshrieking things, and I wish I may never speak another word if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave to talk on our fingers entirely, from that time forth until the\r\nchildren got tired of the whistles. And if ever another man gives a\r\nwhistle to a child of mine and I get my hands on him, I will hang him\r\nhigher than Haman! That is the word with the bark on it! Shade of Nephi!\r\n_You_ don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about married life. I am rich, and everybody\r\nknows it. I am benevolent, and everybody takes advantage of it. I have a\r\nstrong fatherly instinct and all the foundlings are foisted on me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time a woman wants to do well by her darling, she puzzles her\r\nbrain to cipher out some scheme for getting it into my hands. Why, sir,\r\na woman came here once with a child of a curious lifeless sort of\r\ncomplexion (and so had the woman), and swore that the child was mine and\r\nshe my wife\xe2\x80\x94that I had married her at such-and-such a time in such-and-\r\nsuch a place, but she had forgotten her number, and of course I could\r\nnot remember her name. Well, sir, she called my attention to the fact\r\nthat the child looked like me, and really it did seem to resemble me\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ncommon thing in the Territory\xe2\x80\x94and, to cut the story short, I put it in\r\nmy nursery, and she left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n124.jpg (68K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd by the ghost of Orson Hyde, when they came to wash the paint off\r\nthat child it was an Injun! Bless my soul, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about\r\nmarried life. It is a perfect dog\xe2\x80\x99s life, sir\xe2\x80\x94a perfect dog\xe2\x80\x99s life. You\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t economize. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible. I have tried keeping one set of\r\nbridal attire for all occasions. But it is of no use. First you\xe2\x80\x99ll marry\r\na combination of calico and consumption that\xe2\x80\x99s as thin as a rail, and\r\nnext you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a creature that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more than the dropsy in\r\ndisguise, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to eke out that bridal dress with an old\r\nballoon. That is the way it goes. And think of the wash-bill\xe2\x80\x94(excuse\r\nthese tears)\xe2\x80\x94nine hundred and eighty-four pieces a week! No, sir, there\r\nis no such a thing as economy in a family like mine. Why, just the one\r\nitem of cradles\xe2\x80\x94think of it! And vermifuge! Soothing syrup! Teething\r\nrings! And \xe2\x80\x98papa\xe2\x80\x99s watches\xe2\x80\x99 for the babies to play with! And things to\r\nscratch the furniture with! And lucifer matches for them to eat, and\r\npieces of glass to cut themselves with! The item of glass alone would\r\nsupport _your_ family, I venture to say, sir. Let me scrimp and squeeze\r\nall I can, I still can\xe2\x80\x99t get ahead as fast as I feel I ought to, with my\r\nopportunities. Bless you, sir, at a time when I had seventy-two wives in\r\nthis house, I groaned under the pressure of keeping thousands of dollars\r\ntied up in seventy-two bedsteads when the money ought to have been out\r\nat interest; and I just sold out the whole stock, sir, at a sacrifice,\r\nand built a bedstead seven feet long and ninety-six feet wide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n126.jpg (99K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was a failure, sir. I could _not_ sleep. It appeared to me that\r\nthe whole seventy-two women snored at once. The roar was deafening. And\r\nthen the danger of it! That was what I was looking at. They would all\r\ndraw in their breath at once, and you could actually see the walls of\r\nthe house suck in\xe2\x80\x94and then they would all exhale their breath at once,\r\nand you could see the walls swell out, and strain, and hear the rafters\r\ncrack, and the shingles grind together. My friend, take an old man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nadvice, and _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ encumber yourself with a large family\xe2\x80\x94mind, I tell\r\nyou, don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. In a small family, and in a small family only, you\r\nwill find that comfort and that peace of mind which are the best at last\r\nof the blessings this world is able to afford us, and for the lack of\r\nwhich no accumulation of wealth, and no acquisition of fame, power, and\r\ngreatness can ever compensate us. Take my word for it, ten or eleven\r\nwives is all you need\xe2\x80\x94never go over it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome instinct or other made me set this Johnson down as being\r\nunreliable. And yet he was a very entertaining person, and I doubt if\r\nsome of the information he gave us could have been acquired from any\r\nother source. He was a pleasant contrast to those reticent Mormons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the \xe2\x80\x9celect\xe2\x80\x9d have\r\nseen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it. I brought away a\r\ncopy from Salt Lake. The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a\r\npretentious affair, and yet so \xe2\x80\x9cslow,\xe2\x80\x9d so sleepy; such an insipid mess\r\nof inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this\r\nbook, the act was a miracle\xe2\x80\x94keeping awake while he did it was, at any\r\nrate. If he, according to tradition, merely translated it from certain\r\nancient and mysteriously-engraved plates of copper, which he declares he\r\nfound under a stone, in an out-of-the-way locality, the work of\r\ntranslating was equally a miracle, for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with\r\nthe Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the\r\nNew Testament. The author labored to give his words and phrases the\r\nquaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntranslation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel\xe2\x80\x94half modern\r\nglibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity. The latter is awkward\r\nand constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast.\r\nWhenever he found his speech growing too modern\xe2\x80\x94which was about every\r\nsentence or two\xe2\x80\x94he ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as \xe2\x80\x9cexceeding\r\nsore,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cand it came to pass,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., and made things satisfactory again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it came to pass\xe2\x80\x9d was his pet. If he had left that out, his Bible\r\nwould have been only a pamphlet.\r\n\r\nThe title-page reads as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE BOOK OF MORMON: AN ACCOUNT WRITTEN BY THE HAND OF MORMON, UPON\r\nPLATES TAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI.\r\n\r\nWherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and\r\nalso of the Lamanites; written to the Lamanites, who are a remnant of\r\nthe House of Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile; written by way of\r\ncommandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation.\r\nWritten and sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be\r\ndestroyed; to come forth by the gift and power of God unto the\r\ninterpretation thereof; sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto\r\nthe Lord, to come forth in due time by the way of Gentile; the\r\ninterpretation thereof by the gift of God. An abridgment taken from the\r\nBook of Ether also; which is a record of the people of Jared; who were\r\nscattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people\r\nwhen they were building a tower to get to Heaven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHid up\xe2\x80\x9d is good. And so is \xe2\x80\x9cwherefore\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94though why \xe2\x80\x9cwherefore\xe2\x80\x9d? Any\r\nother word would have answered as well\xe2\x80\x94though\xe2\x80\x94in truth it would not have\r\nsounded so Scriptural.\r\n\r\nNext comes:\r\n\r\nTHE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES. Be it known unto all nations,\r\nkindreds, tongues, and people unto whom this work shall come, that we,\r\nthrough the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have\r\nseen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the\r\npeople of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of\r\nthe people of Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken;\r\nand we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of\r\nGod, for His voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a\r\nsurety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the\r\nengravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us\r\nby the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of\r\nsoberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought\r\nand laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the\r\nengravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the\r\nFather, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that\r\nthese things are true; and it is marvellous in our eyes; nevertheless\r\nthe voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it;\r\nwherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear\r\ntestimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in\r\nChrist, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found\r\nspotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with Him\r\neternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the\r\nSon, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen. OLIVER COWDERY,\r\nDAVID WHITMER, MARTIN HARRIS.\r\n\r\nSome people have to have a world of evidence before they can come\r\nanywhere in the neighborhood of believing anything; but for me, when a\r\nman tells me that he has \xe2\x80\x9cseen the engravings which are upon the\r\nplates,\xe2\x80\x9d and not only that, but an angel was there at the time, and saw\r\nhim see them, and probably took his receipt for it, I am very far on the\r\nroad to conviction, no matter whether I ever heard of that man before or\r\nnot, and even if I do not know the name of the angel, or his nationality\r\neither.\r\n\r\nNext is this:\r\n\r\nAND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES. Be it known unto all nations,\r\nkindreds, tongues, and people unto whom this work shall come, that\r\nJoseph Smith, Jr., the translator of this work, has shown unto us the\r\nplates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and\r\nas many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated, we did handle\r\nwith our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has\r\nthe appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we\r\nbear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto\r\nus, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said\r\nSmith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names\r\nunto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen; and\r\nwe lie not, God bearing witness of it. CHRISTIAN WHITMER, JACOB WHITMER,\r\nPETER WHITMER, JR., JOHN WHITMER, HIRAM PAGE, JOSEPH SMITH, SR., HYRUM\r\nSMITH, SAMUEL H. SMITH.\r\n\r\nAnd when I am far on the road to conviction, and eight men, be they\r\ngrammatical or otherwise, come forward and tell me that they have seen\r\nthe plates too; and not only seen those plates but \xe2\x80\x9chefted\xe2\x80\x9d them, I am\r\nconvinced. I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire\r\nWhitmer family had testified.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon Bible consists of fifteen \xe2\x80\x9cbooks\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94being the books of Jacob,\r\nEnos, Jarom, Omni, Mosiah, Zeniff, Alma, Helaman, Ether, Moroni, two\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbooks\xe2\x80\x9d of Mormon, and three of Nephi.\r\n\r\nIn the first book of Nephi is a plagiarism of the Old Testament, which\r\ngives an account of the exodus from Jerusalem of the \xe2\x80\x9cchildren of Lehi\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand it goes on to tell of their wanderings in the wilderness, during\r\neight years, and their supernatural protection by one of their number, a\r\nparty by the name of Nephi. They finally reached the land of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBountiful,\xe2\x80\x9d and camped by the sea. After they had remained there \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nthe space of many days\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is more Scriptural than definite\xe2\x80\x94Nephi was\r\ncommanded from on high to build a ship wherein to \xe2\x80\x9ccarry the people\r\nacross the waters.\xe2\x80\x9d He travestied Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark\xe2\x80\x94but he obeyed orders in the\r\nmatter of the plan. He finished the ship _in a single day_, while his\r\nbrethren stood by and made fun of it\xe2\x80\x94and of him, too\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csaying, our\r\nbrother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship.\xe2\x80\x9d They did\r\nnot wait for the timbers to dry, but the whole tribe or nation sailed\r\nthe next day. Then a bit of genuine nature cropped out, and is revealed\r\nby outspoken Nephi with Scriptural frankness\xe2\x80\x94they all got on a spree!\r\nThey, \xe2\x80\x9cand also their wives, began to make themselves merry, insomuch\r\nthat they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness;\r\nyea, they were lifted up unto exceeding rudeness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNephi tried to stop these scandalous proceedings; but they tied him neck\r\nand heels, and went on with their lark. But observe how Nephi the\r\nprophet circumvented them by the aid of the invisible powers:\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I could\r\nnot move, the compass, which had been prepared of the Lord, did cease to\r\nwork; wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship,\r\ninsomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and terrible\r\ntempest, and we were driven back upon the waters for the space of three\r\ndays; and they began to be frightened exceedingly, lest they should be\r\ndrowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not loose me. And on the\r\nfourth day, which we had been driven back, the tempest began to be\r\nexceeding sore. And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed\r\nup in the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nThen they untied him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n131.jpg (77K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the\r\ncompass, and it did work whither I desired it. And it came to pass that\r\nI prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed, the winds did cease, and\r\nthe storm did cease, and there was a great calm.\r\n\r\nEquipped with their compass, these ancients appear to have had the\r\nadvantage of Noah.\r\n\r\nTheir voyage was toward a \xe2\x80\x9cpromised land\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the only name they give it.\r\nThey reached it in safety.\r\n\r\nPolygamy is a recent feature in the Mormon religion, and was added by\r\nBrigham Young after Joseph Smith\xe2\x80\x99s death. Before that, it was regarded\r\nas an \xe2\x80\x9cabomination.\xe2\x80\x9d This verse from the Mormon Bible occurs in Chapter\r\nII. of the book of Jacob:\r\n\r\nFor behold, thus saith the Lord, this people begin to wax in iniquity;\r\nthey understand not the Scriptures; for they seek to excuse themselves\r\nin committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written\r\nconcerning David, and Solomon his son. Behold, David and Solomon truly\r\nhad many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me,\r\nsaith the Lord; wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people\r\nforth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I\r\nmight raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of\r\nJoseph. Wherefore, I the Lord God, will no suffer that this people shall\r\ndo like unto them of old.\r\n\r\nHowever, the project failed\xe2\x80\x94or at least the modern Mormon end of it\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nBrigham \xe2\x80\x9csuffers\xe2\x80\x9d it. This verse is from the same chapter:\r\n\r\nBehold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate, because of their\r\nfilthiness and the cursings which hath come upon their skins, are more\r\nrighteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the\r\nLord, which was given unto our fathers, that they should have, save it\r\nwere one wife; and concubines they should have none.\r\n\r\nThe following verse (from Chapter IX. of the Book of Nephi) appears to\r\ncontain information not familiar to everybody:\r\n\r\nAnd now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into heaven, the\r\nmultitude did disperse, and every man did take his wife and his\r\nchildren, and did return to his own home.\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was gathered\r\ntogether, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had raised from the\r\ndead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name was Jonas,\r\nand also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumenenhi,\r\nand Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah; now\r\nthese were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had chosen.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may observe how much more grandeur and\r\npicturesqueness (as seen by these Mormon twelve) accompanied on of the\r\ntenderest episodes in the life of our Saviour than other eyes seem to\r\nhave been aware of, I quote the following from the same \xe2\x80\x9cbook\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Nephi:\r\n\r\nAnd it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise. And\r\nthey arose from the earth, and He said unto them, Blessed are ye because\r\nof your faith. And now behold, My joy is full. And when He had said\r\nthese words, He wept, and the multitude bear record of it, and He took\r\ntheir little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the\r\nFather for them. And when He had done this He wept again, and He spake\r\nunto the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold your little ones. And as\r\nthey looked to behold, they cast their eyes toward heaven, and they saw\r\nthe heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it\r\nwere, in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those\r\nlittle ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the\r\nangels did minister unto them, and the multitude did see and hear and\r\nbear record; and they know that their record is true, for they all of\r\nthem did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number\r\nabout two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men,\r\nwomen, and children.\r\n\r\nAnd what else would they be likely to consist of?\r\n\r\nThe Book of Ether is an incomprehensible medley of \xe2\x80\x9chistory,\xe2\x80\x9d much of it\r\nrelating to battles and sieges among peoples whom the reader has\r\npossibly never heard of; and who inhabited a country which is not set\r\ndown in the geography. There was a King with the remarkable name of\r\nCoriantumr, and he warred with Shared, and Lib, and Shiz, and others, in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cplains of Heshlon\xe2\x80\x9d; and the \xe2\x80\x9cvalley of Gilgal\xe2\x80\x9d; and the \xe2\x80\x9cwilderness\r\nof Akish\xe2\x80\x9d; and the \xe2\x80\x9cland of Moran\xe2\x80\x9d; and the \xe2\x80\x9cplains of Agosh\xe2\x80\x9d; and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOgath,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRamah,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cland of Corihor,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9chill Comnor,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nby \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of Ripliancum,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc., etc. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it came to pass,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nafter a deal of fighting, that Coriantumr, upon making calculation of\r\nhis losses, found that \xe2\x80\x9cthere had been slain two millions of mighty men,\r\nand also their wives and their children\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94say 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 in\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand he began to sorrow in his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d Unquestionably it was time.\r\nSo he wrote to Shiz, asking a cessation of hostilities, and offering to\r\ngive up his kingdom to save his people. Shiz declined, except upon\r\ncondition that Coriantumr would come and let him cut his head off\r\nfirst\xe2\x80\x94a thing which Coriantumr would not do. Then there was more\r\nfighting for a season; then _four years_ were devoted to gathering the\r\nforces for a final struggle\xe2\x80\x94after which ensued a battle, which, I take\r\nit, is the most remarkable set forth in history,\xe2\x80\x94except, perhaps, that\r\nof the Kilkenny cats, which it resembles in some respects. This is the\r\naccount of the gathering and the battle:\r\n\r\n7. And it came to pass that they did gather together all the people,\r\nupon all the face of the land, who had not been slain, save it was\r\nEther. And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of the\r\npeople; and he beheld that the people who were for Coriantumr, were\r\ngathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and the people who were for\r\nShiz, were gathered together to the army of Shiz; wherefore they were\r\nfor the space of four years gathering together the people, that they\r\nmight get all who were upon the face of the land, and that they might\r\nreceive all the strength which it was possible that they could receive.\r\nAnd it came to pass that when they were all gathered together, every one\r\nto the army which he would, with their wives and their children; both\r\nmen, women, and children being armed with weapons of war, having\r\nshields, and breast-plates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the\r\nmanner of war, they did march forth one against another, to battle; and\r\nthey fought all that day, and conquered not. And it came to pass that\r\nwhen it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and after\r\nthey had retired to their camps, they took up a howling and a\r\nlamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so great were\r\ntheir cries, their howlings and lamentations, that it did rend the air\r\nexceedingly. And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to\r\nbattle, and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless they conquered\r\nnot, and when the night came again, they did rend the air with their\r\ncries, and their howlings, and their mournings, for the loss of the\r\nslain of their people.\r\n\r\n8. And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto Shiz,\r\ndesiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he would take\r\nthe kingdom, and spare the lives of the people. But behold, the Spirit\r\nof the Lord had ceased striving with them, and Satan had full power over\r\nthe hearts of the people, for they were given up unto the hardness of\r\ntheir hearts, and the blindness of their minds that they might be\r\ndestroyed; wherefore they went again to battle. And it came to pass that\r\nthey fought all that day, and when the night came they slept upon their\r\nswords; and on the morrow they fought even until the night came; and\r\nwhen the night came they were drunken with anger, even as a man who is\r\ndrunken with wine; and they slept again upon their swords; and on the\r\nmorrow they fought again; and when the night came they had all fallen by\r\nthe sword save it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr, and\r\nsixty and nine of the people of Shiz. And it came to pass that they\r\nslept upon their swords that night, and on the morrow they fought again,\r\nand they contended in their mights with their swords, and with their\r\nshields, all that day; and when the night came there were thirty and two\r\nof the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of Coriantumr.\r\n\r\n9. And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for death\r\non the morrow. And they were large and mighty men, as to the strength of\r\nmen. And it came to pass that they fought for the space of three hours,\r\nand they fainted with the loss of blood. And it came to pass that when\r\nthe men of Coriantumr had received sufficient strength, that they could\r\nwalk, they were about to flee for their lives, but behold, Shiz arose,\r\nand also his men, and he swore in his wrath that he would slay\r\nCoriantumr, or he would perish by the sword: wherefore he did pursue\r\nthem, and on the morrow he did overtake them; and they fought again with\r\nthe sword. And it came to pass that when they had all fallen by the\r\nsword, save it were Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with\r\nloss of blood. And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon\r\nhis sword, that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz. And\r\nit came to pass that after he had smote off the head of Shiz, that Shiz\r\nraised upon his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for\r\nbreath, he died. And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the earth,\r\nand became as if he had no life. And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said\r\nunto him, go forth. And he went forth, and beheld that the words of the\r\nLord had all been fulfilled; and he finished his record; and the\r\nhundredth part I have not written.\r\n\r\nIt seems a pity he did not finish, for after all his dreary former\r\nchapters of commonplace, he stopped just as he was in danger of becoming\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon Bible is rather stupid and tiresome to read, but there is\r\nnothing vicious in its teachings. Its code of morals is\r\nunobjectionable\xe2\x80\x94it is \xe2\x80\x9csmouched\xe2\x80\x9d [Milton] from the New Testament and no\r\ncredit given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of our two days\xe2\x80\x99 sojourn, we left Great Salt Lake City hearty\r\nand well fed and happy\xe2\x80\x94physically superb but not so very much wiser, as\r\nregards the \xe2\x80\x9cMormon question,\xe2\x80\x9d than we were when we arrived, perhaps. We\r\nhad a deal more \xe2\x80\x9cinformation\xe2\x80\x9d than we had before, of course, but we did\r\nnot know what portion of it was reliable and what was not\xe2\x80\x94for it all\r\ncame from acquaintances of a day\xe2\x80\x94strangers, strictly speaking. We were\r\ntold, for instance, that the dreadful \xe2\x80\x9cMountain Meadows Massacre\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nthe work of the Indians entirely, and that the Gentiles had meanly tried\r\nto fasten it upon the Mormons; we were told, likewise, that the Indians\r\nwere to blame, partly, and partly the Mormons; and we were told,\r\nlikewise, and just as positively, that the Mormons were almost if not\r\nwholly and completely responsible for that most treacherous and pitiless\r\nbutchery. We got the story in all these different shapes, but it was not\r\ntill several years afterward that Mrs. Waite\xe2\x80\x99s book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mormon\r\nProphet,\xe2\x80\x9d came out with Judge Cradlebaugh\xe2\x80\x99s trial of the accused parties\r\nin it and revealed the truth that the latter version was the correct one\r\nand that the Mormons _were_ the assassins. All our \xe2\x80\x9cinformation\xe2\x80\x9d had\r\nthree sides to it, and so I gave up the idea that I could settle the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMormon question\xe2\x80\x9d in two days. Still I have seen newspaper\r\ncorrespondents do it in one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n137.jpg (62K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Great Salt Lake a good deal confused as to what state of things\r\nexisted there\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes even questioning in my own mind whether a\r\nstate of things existed there at all or not. But presently I remembered\r\nwith a lightening sense of relief that we had learned two or three\r\ntrivial things there which we could be certain of; and so the two days\r\nwere not wholly lost. For instance, we had learned that we were at last\r\nin a pioneer land, in absolute and tangible reality.\r\n\r\nThe high prices charged for trifles were eloquent of high freights and\r\nbewildering distances of freightage. In the east, in those days, the\r\nsmallest moneyed denomination was a penny and it represented the\r\nsmallest purchasable quantity of any commodity. West of Cincinnati the\r\nsmallest coin in use was the silver five-cent piece and no smaller\r\nquantity of an article could be bought than \xe2\x80\x9cfive cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth.\xe2\x80\x9d In\r\nOverland City the lowest coin appeared to be the ten-cent piece; but in\r\nSalt Lake there did not seem to be any money in circulation smaller than\r\na quarter, or any smaller quantity purchasable of any commodity than\r\ntwenty-five cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth. We had always been used to half dimes and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfive cents\xe2\x80\x99 worth\xe2\x80\x9d as the minimum of financial negotiations; but in\r\nSalt Lake if one wanted a cigar, it was a quarter; if he wanted a chalk\r\npipe, it was a quarter; if he wanted a peach, or a candle, or a\r\nnewspaper, or a shave, or a little Gentile whiskey to rub on his corns\r\nto arrest indigestion and keep him from having the toothache, twenty-\r\nfive cents was the price, every time. When we looked at the shot-bag of\r\nsilver, now and then, we seemed to be wasting our substance in riotous\r\nliving, but if we referred to the expense account we could see that we\r\nhad not been doing anything of the kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n138.jpg (21K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut people easily get reconciled to big money and big prices, and fond\r\nand vain of both\xe2\x80\x94it is a descent to little coins and cheap prices that\r\nis hardest to bear and slowest to take hold upon one\xe2\x80\x99s toleration. After\r\na month\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with the twenty-five cent minimum, the average\r\nhuman being is ready to blush every time he thinks of his despicable\r\nfive-cent days. How sunburnt with blushes I used to get in gaudy Nevada,\r\nevery time I thought of my first financial experience in Salt Lake. It\r\nwas on this wise (which is a favorite expression of great authors, and a\r\nvery neat one, too, but I never hear anybody _say_ on this wise when\r\nthey are talking). A young half-breed with a complexion like a yellow-\r\njacket asked me if I would have my boots blacked. It was at the Salt\r\nLake House the morning after we arrived. I said yes, and he blacked\r\nthem. Then I handed him a silver five-cent piece, with the benevolent\r\nair of a person who is conferring wealth and blessedness upon poverty\r\nand suffering. The yellow-jacket took it with what I judged to be\r\nsuppressed emotion, and laid it reverently down in the middle of his\r\nbroad hand. Then he began to contemplate it, much as a philosopher\r\ncontemplates a gnat\xe2\x80\x99s ear in the ample field of his microscope. Several\r\nmountaineers, teamsters, stage-drivers, etc., drew near and dropped into\r\nthe tableau and fell to surveying the money with that attractive\r\nindifference to formality which is noticeable in the hardy pioneer.\r\nPresently the yellow-jacket handed the half dime back to me and told me\r\nI ought to keep my money in my pocket-book instead of in my soul, and\r\nthen I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it cramped and shriveled up so!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n139.jpg (61K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a roar of vulgar laughter there was! I destroyed the mongrel\r\nreptile on the spot, but I smiled and smiled all the time I was\r\ndetaching his scalp, for the remark he made _was_ good for an \xe2\x80\x9cInjun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYes, we had learned in Salt Lake to be charged great prices without\r\nletting the inward shudder appear on the surface\xe2\x80\x94for even already we had\r\noverheard and noted the tenor of conversations among drivers,\r\nconductors, and hostlers, and finally among citizens of Salt Lake, until\r\nwe were well aware that these superior beings despised \xe2\x80\x9cemigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\npermitted no tell-tale shudders and winces in our countenances, for we\r\nwanted to seem pioneers, or Mormons, half-breeds, teamsters, stage-\r\ndrivers, Mountain Meadow assassins\xe2\x80\x94anything in the world that the plains\r\nand Utah respected and admired\xe2\x80\x94but we were wretchedly ashamed of being\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cemigrants,\xe2\x80\x9d and sorry enough that we had white shirts and could not\r\nswear in the presence of ladies without looking the other way.\r\n\r\nAnd many a time in Nevada, afterwards, we had occasion to remember with\r\nhumiliation that we were \xe2\x80\x9cemigrants,\xe2\x80\x9d and consequently a low and\r\ninferior sort of creatures. Perhaps the reader has visited Utah, Nevada,\r\nor California, even in these latter days, and while communing with\r\nhimself upon the sorrowful banishment of these countries from what he\r\nconsiders \xe2\x80\x9cthe world,\xe2\x80\x9d has had his wings clipped by finding that _he_ is\r\nthe one to be pitied, and that there are entire populations around him\r\nready and willing to do it for him\xe2\x80\x94yea, who are complacently doing it\r\nfor him already, wherever he steps his foot.\r\n\r\nPoor thing, they are making fun of his hat; and the cut of his New York\r\ncoat; and his conscientiousness about his grammar; and his feeble\r\nprofanity; and his consumingly ludicrous ignorance of ores, shafts,\r\ntunnels, and other things which he never saw before, and never felt\r\nenough interest in to read about. And all the time that he is thinking\r\nwhat a sad fate it is to be exiled to that far country, that lonely\r\nland, the citizens around him are looking down on him with a blighting\r\ncompassion because he is an \xe2\x80\x9cemigrant\xe2\x80\x9d instead of that proudest and\r\nblessedest creature that exists on all the earth, a \xe2\x80\x9cFORTY-NINER.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n140.jpg (30K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accustomed coach life began again, now, and by midnight it almost\r\nseemed as if we never had been out of our snuggery among the mail sacks\r\nat all. We had made one alteration, however. We had provided enough\r\nbread, boiled ham and hard boiled eggs to last double the six hundred\r\nmiles of staging we had still to do.\r\n\r\nAnd it was comfort in those succeeding days to sit up and contemplate\r\nthe majestic panorama of mountains and valleys spread out below us and\r\neat ham and hard boiled eggs while our spiritual natures revelled\r\nalternately in rainbows, thunderstorms, and peerless sunsets. Nothing\r\nhelps scenery like ham and eggs. Ham and eggs, and after these a pipe\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nold, rank, delicious pipe\xe2\x80\x94ham and eggs and scenery, a \xe2\x80\x9cdown grade,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\nflying coach, a fragrant pipe and a contented heart\xe2\x80\x94these make\r\nhappiness. It is what all the ages have struggled for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n141.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt eight in the morning we reached the remnant and ruin of what had been\r\nthe important military station of \xe2\x80\x9cCamp Floyd,\xe2\x80\x9d some forty-five or fifty\r\nmiles from Salt Lake City. At four P.M. we had doubled our distance and\r\nwere ninety or a hundred miles from Salt Lake. And now we entered upon\r\none of that species of deserts whose concentrated hideousness shames the\r\ndiffused and diluted horrors of Sahara\xe2\x80\x94an \xe2\x80\x9c_alkali_\xe2\x80\x9d desert. For sixty-\r\neight miles there was but one break in it. I do not remember that this\r\nwas really a break; indeed it seems to me that it was nothing but a\r\nwatering depot _in the midst_ of the stretch of sixty-eight miles. If my\r\nmemory serves me, there was no well or spring at this place, but the\r\nwater was hauled there by mule and ox teams from the further side of the\r\ndesert. There was a stage station there. It was forty-five miles from\r\nthe beginning of the desert, and twenty-three from the end of it.\r\n\r\nWe plowed and dragged and groped along, the whole live-long night, and\r\nat the end of this uncomfortable twelve hours we finished the forty-five\r\nmile part of the desert and got to the stage station where the imported\r\nwater was. The sun was just rising. It was easy enough to cross a desert\r\nin the night while we were asleep; and it was pleasant to reflect, in\r\nthe morning, that we in actual person _had_ encountered an absolute\r\ndesert and could always speak knowingly of deserts in presence of the\r\nignorant thenceforward. And it was pleasant also to reflect that this\r\nwas not an obscure, back country desert, but a very celebrated one, the\r\nmetropolis itself, as you may say. All this was very well and very\r\ncomfortable and satisfactory\xe2\x80\x94but now we were to cross a desert in\r\n_daylight_. This was fine\xe2\x80\x94novel\xe2\x80\x94romantic\xe2\x80\x94dramatically\r\nadventurous\xe2\x80\x94_this_, indeed, was worth living for, worth traveling for!\r\nWe would write home all about it.\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm, this stern thirst for adventure, wilted under the\r\nsultry August sun and did not last above one hour. One poor little\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x94and then we were ashamed that we had \xe2\x80\x9cgushed\xe2\x80\x9d so. The poetry was\r\nall in the anticipation\xe2\x80\x94there is none in the reality. Imagine a vast,\r\nwaveless ocean stricken dead and turned to ashes; imagine this solemn\r\nwaste tufted with ash-dusted sage-bushes; imagine the lifeless silence\r\nand solitude that belong to such a place; imagine a coach, creeping like\r\na bug through the midst of this shoreless level, and sending up tumbled\r\nvolumes of dust as if it were a bug that went by steam; imagine this\r\naching monotony of toiling and plowing kept up hour after hour, and the\r\nshore still as far away as ever, apparently; imagine team, driver, coach\r\nand passengers so deeply coated with ashes that they are all one\r\ncolorless color; imagine ash-drifts roosting above moustaches and\r\neyebrows like snow accumulations on boughs and bushes. This is the\r\nreality of it.\r\n\r\nThe sun beats down with dead, blistering, relentless malignity; the\r\nperspiration is welling from every pore in man and beast, but scarcely a\r\nsign of it finds its way to the surface\xe2\x80\x94it is absorbed before it gets\r\nthere; there is not the faintest breath of air stirring; there is not a\r\nmerciful shred of cloud in all the brilliant firmament; there is not a\r\nliving creature visible in _any_ direction whither one searches the\r\nblank level that stretches its monotonous miles on every hand; there is\r\nnot a sound\xe2\x80\x94not a sigh\xe2\x80\x94not a whisper\xe2\x80\x94not a buzz, or a whir of wings, or\r\ndistant pipe of bird\xe2\x80\x94not even a sob from the lost souls that doubtless\r\npeople that dead air. And so the occasional sneezing of the resting\r\nmules, and the champing of the bits, grate harshly on the grim\r\nstillness, not dissipating the spell but accenting it and making one\r\nfeel more lonesome and forsaken than before.\r\n\r\nThe mules, under violent swearing, coaxing and whip-cracking, would make\r\nat stated intervals a \xe2\x80\x9cspurt,\xe2\x80\x9d and drag the coach a hundred or may be\r\ntwo hundred yards, stirring up a billowy cloud of dust that rolled back,\r\nenveloping the vehicle to the wheel-tops or higher, and making it seem\r\nafloat in a fog. Then a rest followed, with the usual sneezing and bit-\r\nchamping. Then another \xe2\x80\x9cspurt\xe2\x80\x9d of a hundred yards and another rest at\r\nthe end of it. All day long we kept this up, without water for the mules\r\nand without ever changing the team. At least we kept it up ten hours,\r\nwhich, I take it, is a day, and a pretty honest one, in an alkali\r\ndesert. It was from four in the morning till two in the afternoon. And\r\nit was so hot! and so close! and our water canteens went dry in the\r\nmiddle of the day and we got so thirsty! It was so stupid and tiresome\r\nand dull! and the tedious hours did lag and drag and limp along with\r\nsuch a cruel deliberation! It was so trying to give one\xe2\x80\x99s watch a good\r\nlong undisturbed spell and then take it out and find that it had been\r\nfooling away the time and not trying to get ahead any! The alkali dust\r\ncut through our lips, it persecuted our eyes, it ate through the\r\ndelicate membranes and made our noses bleed and _kept_ them bleeding\xe2\x80\x94and\r\ntruly and seriously the romance all faded far away and disappeared, and\r\nleft the desert trip nothing but a harsh reality\xe2\x80\x94a thirsty, sweltering,\r\nlonging, hateful reality!\r\n\r\nTwo miles and a quarter an hour for ten hours\xe2\x80\x94that was what we\r\naccomplished. It was hard to bring the comprehension away down to such a\r\nsnail-pace as that, when we had been used to making eight and ten miles\r\nan hour. When we reached the station on the farther verge of the desert,\r\nwe were glad, for the first time, that the dictionary was along, because\r\nwe never could have found language to tell how glad we were, in any sort\r\nof dictionary but an unabridged one with pictures in it. But there could\r\nnot have been found in a whole library of dictionaries language\r\nsufficient to tell how tired those mules were after their twenty-three\r\nmile pull. To try to give the reader an idea of how _thirsty_ they were,\r\nwould be to \xe2\x80\x9cgild refined gold or paint the lily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow, now that it is there, the quotation does not seem to fit\xe2\x80\x94but no\r\nmatter, let it stay, anyhow. I think it is a graceful and attractive\r\nthing, and therefore have tried time and time again to work it in where\r\nit _would_ fit, but could not succeed. These efforts have kept my mind\r\ndistracted and ill at ease, and made my narrative seem broken and\r\ndisjointed, in places. Under these circumstances it seems to me best to\r\nleave it in, as above, since this will afford at least a temporary\r\nrespite from the wear and tear of trying to \xe2\x80\x9clead up\xe2\x80\x9d to this really apt\r\nand beautiful quotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n145.jpg (32K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at\r\nthe entrance of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt\r\nLake. It was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any\r\nhabitation of white men, except the stage stations, that we came across\r\nthe wretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing. I\r\nrefer to the Goshoot Indians. From what we could see and all we could\r\nlearn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger\r\nIndians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our\r\ncontinent; inferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the\r\nHottentots, and actually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of\r\nAfrica. Indeed, I have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUncivilized Races of Men\xe2\x80\x9d clear through in order to find a savage tribe\r\ndegraded enough to take rank with the Goshoots. I find but one people\r\nfairly open to that shameful verdict. It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of\r\nSouth Africa. Such of the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging\r\nabout the stations, were small, lean, \xe2\x80\x9cscrawny\xe2\x80\x9d creatures; in complexion\r\na dull black like the ordinary American negro; their faces and hands\r\nbearing dirt which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months,\r\nyears, and even generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a\r\nsilent, sneaking, treacherous looking race; taking note of everything,\r\ncovertly, like all the other \xe2\x80\x9cNoble Red Men\xe2\x80\x9d that we (do not) read\r\nabout, and betraying no sign in their countenances; indolent,\r\neverlastingly patient and tireless, like all other Indians; prideless\r\nbeggars\xe2\x80\x94for if the beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would\r\nnot \xe2\x80\x9cgo,\xe2\x80\x9d any more than a clock without a pendulum; hungry, always\r\nhungry, and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat, though\r\noften eating what a hog would decline; hunters, but having no higher\r\nambition than to kill and eat jack-ass rabbits, crickets and\r\ngrasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from the buzzards and cayotes;\r\nsavages who, when asked if they have the common Indian belief in a Great\r\nSpirit show a something which almost amounts to emotion, thinking\r\nwhiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of almost naked black\r\nchildren, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at all, and have no\r\nvillages, and no gatherings together into strictly defined tribal\r\ncommunities\xe2\x80\x94a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep\r\noff a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky,\r\nwintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n147.jpg (86K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bushmen and our Goshoots are manifestly descended from the self-same\r\ngorilla, or kangaroo, or Norway rat, whichever animal-Adam the\r\nDarwinians trace them to.\r\n\r\nOne would as soon expect the rabbits to fight as the Goshoots, and yet\r\nthey used to live off the offal and refuse of the stations a few months\r\nand then come some dark night when no mischief was expected, and burn\r\ndown the buildings and kill the men from ambush as they rushed out. And\r\nonce, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District Judge,\r\nof Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first volley\r\nof arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains, wounded\r\na horse or two and mortally wounded the driver. The latter was full of\r\npluck, and so was his passenger. At the driver\xe2\x80\x99s call Judge Mott swung\r\nhimself out, clambered to the box and seized the reins of the team, and\r\naway they plunged, through the racing mob of skeletons and under a\r\nhurtling storm of missiles. The stricken driver had sunk down on the\r\nboot as soon as he was wounded, but had held on to the reins and said he\r\nwould manage to keep hold of them until relieved.\r\n\r\nAnd after they were taken from his relaxing grasp, he lay with his head\r\nbetween Judge Mott\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and tranquilly gave directions about the\r\nroad; he said he believed he could live till the miscreants were outrun\r\nand left behind, and that if he managed that, the main difficulty would\r\nbe at an end, and then if the Judge drove so and so (giving directions\r\nabout bad places in the road, and general course) he would reach the\r\nnext station without trouble. The Judge distanced the enemy and at last\r\nrattled up to the station and knew that the night\xe2\x80\x99s perils were done;\r\nbut there was no comrade-in-arms for him to rejoice with, for the\r\nsoldierly driver was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n148.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us forget that we have been saying harsh things about the Overland\r\ndrivers, now. The disgust which the Goshoots gave me, a disciple of\r\nCooper and a worshipper of the Red Man\xe2\x80\x94even of the scholarly savages in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cLast of the Mohicans\xe2\x80\x9d who are fittingly associated with\r\nbackwoodsmen who divide each sentence into two equal parts: one part\r\ncritically grammatical, refined and choice of language, and the other\r\npart just such an attempt to talk like a hunter or a mountaineer, as a\r\nBroadway clerk might make after eating an edition of Emerson Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworks and studying frontier life at the Bowery Theatre a couple of\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x94I say that the nausea which the Goshoots gave me, an Indian\r\nworshipper, set me to examining authorities, to see if perchance I had\r\nbeen over-estimating the Red Man while viewing him through the mellow\r\nmoonshine of romance. The revelations that came were disenchanting. It\r\nwas curious to see how quickly the paint and tinsel fell away from him\r\nand left him treacherous, filthy and repulsive\xe2\x80\x94and how quickly the\r\nevidences accumulated that wherever one finds an Indian tribe he has\r\nonly found Goshoots more or less modified by circumstances and\r\nsurroundings\xe2\x80\x94but Goshoots, after all. They deserve pity, poor creatures;\r\nand they can have mine\xe2\x80\x94at this distance. Nearer by, they never get\r\nanybody\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nThere is an impression abroad that the Baltimore and Washington Railroad\r\nCompany and many of its employees are Goshoots; but it is an error.\r\nThere is only a plausible resemblance, which, while it is apt enough to\r\nmislead the ignorant, cannot deceive parties who have contemplated both\r\ntribes. But seriously, it was not only poor wit, but very wrong to start\r\nthe report referred to above; for however innocent the motive may have\r\nbeen, the necessary effect was to injure the reputation of a class who\r\nhave a hard enough time of it in the pitiless deserts of the Rocky\r\nMountains, Heaven knows! If we cannot find it in our hearts to give\r\nthose poor naked creatures our Christian sympathy and compassion, in\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s name let us at least not throw mud at them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth day we passed the highest mountain peaks we had yet\r\nseen, and although the day was very warm the night that followed upon\r\nits heels was wintry cold and blankets were next to useless.\r\n\r\nOn the eighteenth day we encountered the eastward-bound telegraph-\r\nconstructors at Reese River station and sent a message to his Excellency\r\nGov. Nye at Carson City (distant one hundred and fifty-six miles).\r\n\r\nOn the nineteenth day we crossed the Great American Desert\xe2\x80\x94forty\r\nmemorable miles of bottomless sand, into which the coach wheels sunk\r\nfrom six inches to a foot. We worked our passage most of the way across.\r\nThat is to say, we got out and walked. It was a dreary pull and a long\r\nand thirsty one, for we had no water. From one extremity of this desert\r\nto the other, the road was white with the bones of oxen and horses. It\r\nwould hardly be an exaggeration to say that we could have walked the\r\nforty miles and set our feet on a bone at every step! The desert was one\r\nprodigious graveyard. And the log-chains, wagon tyres, and rotting\r\nwrecks of vehicles were almost as thick as the bones. I think we saw\r\nlog-chains enough rusting there in the desert, to reach across any State\r\nin the Union. Do not these relics suggest something of an idea of the\r\nfearful suffering and privation the early emigrants to California\r\nendured?\r\n\r\nAt the border of the Desert lies Carson Lake, or The \xe2\x80\x9cSink\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nCarson, a shallow, melancholy sheet of water some eighty or a hundred\r\nmiles in circumference. Carson River empties into it and is lost\xe2\x80\x94sinks\r\nmysteriously into the earth and never appears in the light of the sun\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94for the lake has no outlet whatever.\r\n\r\nThere are several rivers in Nevada, and they all have this mysterious\r\nfate. They end in various lakes or \xe2\x80\x9csinks,\xe2\x80\x9d and that is the last of\r\nthem. Carson Lake, Humboldt Lake, Walker Lake, Mono Lake, are all great\r\nsheets of water without any visible outlet. Water is always flowing into\r\nthem; none is ever seen to flow out of them, and yet they remain always\r\nlevel full, neither receding nor overflowing. What they do with their\r\nsurplus is only known to the Creator.\r\n\r\nOn the western verge of the Desert we halted a moment at Ragtown. It\r\nconsisted of one log house and is not set down on the map.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a circumstance. Just after we left Julesburg, on the\r\nPlatte, I was sitting with the driver, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it. Horace Greeley went over this road once. When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick. Hank Monk cracked his whip and started off at an awful pace. The\r\ncoach bounced up and down in such a terrific way that it jolted the\r\nbuttons all off of Horace\xe2\x80\x99s coat, and finally shot his head clean\r\nthrough the roof of the stage, and then he yelled at Hank Monk and\r\nbegged him to go easier\xe2\x80\x94said he warn\xe2\x80\x99t in as much of a hurry as he was\r\nawhile ago. But Hank Monk said, \xe2\x80\x98Keep your seat, Horace, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get\r\nyou there on time\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and you bet you he did, too, what was left of him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n151.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA day or two after that we picked up a Denver man at the cross roads,\r\nand he told us a good deal about the country and the Gregory Diggings.\r\nHe seemed a very entertaining person and a man well posted in the\r\naffairs of Colorado. By and by he remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it. Horace Greeley went over this road once. When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick.

From no other man\r\nduring the whole journey, did we gather such a store of concise and\r\nwell- arranged military information. It was surprising to find in the\r\ndesolate wilds of our country a man so thoroughly acquainted with\r\neverything useful to know in his line of life, and yet of such inferior\r\nrank and unpretentious bearing. For as much as three hours we listened\r\nto him with unabated interest. Finally he got upon the subject of trans-\r\ncontinental travel, and presently said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you a very laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it. Horace Greeley went over this road once. When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture at Placerville and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick.

I can never forget the\r\npathos that was in his voice as he told, in simple language, the story\r\nof his people\xe2\x80\x99s wanderings and unpitied sufferings. No pulpit eloquence\r\nwas ever so moving and so beautiful as this outcast\xe2\x80\x99s picture of the\r\nfirst Mormon pilgrimage across the plains, struggling sorrowfully onward\r\nto the land of its banishment and marking its desolate way with graves\r\nand watering it with tears. His words so wrought upon us that it was a\r\nrelief to us all when the conversation drifted into a more cheerful\r\nchannel and the natural features of the curious country we were in came\r\nunder treatment. One matter after another was pleasantly discussed, and\r\nat length the stranger said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if you would like to\r\nlisten to it. Horace Greeley went over this road once. When he was\r\nleaving Carson City he told the driver, Hank Monk, that he had an\r\nengagement to lecture in Placerville, and was very anxious to go through\r\nquick.

He had walked as long as he could, but his limbs had failed him at\r\nlast. Hunger and fatigue had conquered him. It would have been inhuman\r\nto leave him there. We paid his fare to Carson and lifted him into the\r\ncoach. It was some little time before he showed any very decided signs\r\nof life; but by dint of chafing him and pouring brandy between his lips\r\nwe finally brought him to a languid consciousness. Then we fed him a\r\nlittle, and by and by he seemed to comprehend the situation and a\r\ngrateful light softened his eye. We made his mail-sack bed as\r\ncomfortable as possible, and constructed a pillow for him with our\r\ncoats. He seemed very thankful. Then he looked up in our faces, and said\r\nin a feeble voice that had a tremble of honest emotion in it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I know not who you are, but you have saved my life; and\r\nalthough I can never be able to repay you for it, I feel that I can at\r\nleast make one hour of your long journey lighter. I take it you are\r\nstrangers to this great thorough fare, but I am entirely familiar with\r\nit. In this connection I can tell you a most laughable thing indeed, if\r\nyou would like to listen to it. Horace Greeley\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n154.jpg (51K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI said, impressively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuffering stranger, proceed at your peril. You see in me the melancholy\r\nwreck of a once stalwart and magnificent manhood. What has brought me to\r\nthis? That thing which you are about to tell. Gradually but surely, that\r\ntiresome old anecdote has sapped my strength, undermined my\r\nconstitution, withered my life. Pity my helplessness. Spare me only just\r\nthis once, and tell me about young George Washington and his little\r\nhatchet for a change.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were saved. But not so the invalid. In trying to retain the anecdote\r\nin his system he strained himself and died in our arms.\r\n\r\nI am aware, now, that I ought not to have asked of the sturdiest citizen\r\nof all that region, what I asked of that mere shadow of a man; for,\r\nafter seven years\xe2\x80\x99 residence on the Pacific coast, I know that no\r\npassenger or driver on the Overland ever corked that anecdote in, when a\r\nstranger was by, and survived. Within a period of six years I crossed\r\nand recrossed the Sierras between Nevada and California thirteen times\r\nby stage and listened to that deathless incident four hundred and\r\neighty-one or eighty-two times. I have the list somewhere. Drivers\r\nalways told it, conductors told it, landlords told it, chance passengers\r\ntold it, the very Chinamen and vagrant Indians recounted it. I have had\r\nthe same driver tell it to me two or three times in the same afternoon.\r\nIt has come to me in all the multitude of tongues that Babel bequeathed\r\nto earth, and flavored with whiskey, brandy, beer, cologne, sozodont,\r\ntobacco, garlic, onions, grasshoppers\xe2\x80\x94everything that has a fragrance to\r\nit through all the long list of things that are gorged or guzzled by the\r\nsons of men. I never have smelt any anecdote as often as I have smelt\r\nthat one; never have smelt any anecdote that smelt so variegated as that\r\none. And you never could learn to know it by its smell, because every\r\ntime you thought you had learned the smell of it, it would turn up with\r\na different smell. Bayard Taylor has written about this hoary anecdote,\r\nRichardson has published it; so have Jones, Smith, Johnson, Ross Browne,\r\nand every other correspondence-inditing being that ever set his foot\r\nupon the great overland road anywhere between Julesburg and San\r\nFrancisco; and I have heard that it is in the Talmud. I have seen it in\r\nprint in nine different foreign languages; I have been told that it is\r\nemployed in the inquisition in Rome; and I now learn with regret that it\r\nis going to be set to music. I do not think that such things are right.\r\n\r\nStage-coaching on the Overland is no more, and stage drivers are a race\r\ndefunct. I wonder if they bequeathed that bald-headed anecdote to their\r\nsuccessors, the railroad brakemen and conductors, and if these latter\r\nstill persecute the helpless passenger with it until he concludes, as\r\ndid many a tourist of other days, that the real grandeurs of the Pacific\r\ncoast are not Yo Semite and the Big Trees, but Hank Monk and his\r\nadventure with Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\n[And what makes that worn anecdote the more aggravating, is, that the\r\nadventure it celebrates never occurred. If it were a good anecdote, that\r\nseeming demerit would be its chiefest virtue, for creative power belongs\r\nto greatness; but what ought to be done to a man who would wantonly\r\ncontrive so flat a one as this? If I were to suggest what ought to be\r\ndone to him, I should be called extravagant\xe2\x80\x94but what does the sixteenth\r\nchapter of Daniel say? Aha!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n156.jpg (17K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were approaching the end of our long journey. It was the morning of\r\nthe twentieth day. At noon we would reach Carson City, the capital of\r\nNevada Territory. We were not glad, but sorry. It had been a fine\r\npleasure trip; we had fed fat on wonders every day; we were now well\r\naccustomed to stage life, and very fond of it; so the idea of coming to\r\na stand-still and settling down to a humdrum existence in a village was\r\nnot agreeable, but on the contrary depressing.\r\n\r\nVisibly our new home was a desert, walled in by barren, snow-clad\r\nmountains. There was not a tree in sight. There was no vegetation but\r\nthe endless sage-brush and greasewood. All nature was gray with it. We\r\nwere plowing through great deeps of powdery alkali dust that rose in\r\nthick clouds and floated across the plain like smoke from a burning\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWe were coated with it like millers; so were the coach, the mules, the\r\nmail-bags, the driver\xe2\x80\x94we and the sage-brush and the other scenery were\r\nall one monotonous color. Long trains of freight wagons in the distance\r\nenveloped in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on\r\nfire. These teams and their masters were the only life we saw. Otherwise\r\nwe moved in the midst of solitude, silence and desolation. Every twenty\r\nsteps we passed the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen, with its\r\ndust-coated skin stretched tightly over its empty ribs. Frequently a\r\nsolemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated the passing\r\ncoach with meditative serenity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n158.jpg (17K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by Carson City was pointed out to us. It nestled in the edge of a\r\ngreat plain and was a sufficient number of miles away to look like an\r\nassemblage of mere white spots in the shadow of a grim range of\r\nmountains overlooking it, whose summits seemed lifted clear out of\r\ncompanionship and consciousness of earthly things.\r\n\r\nWe arrived, disembarked, and the stage went on. It was a \xe2\x80\x9cwooden\xe2\x80\x9d town;\r\nits population two thousand souls. The main street consisted of four or\r\nfive blocks of little white frame stores which were too high to sit down\r\non, but not too high for various other purposes; in fact, hardly high\r\nenough. They were packed close together, side by side, as if room were\r\nscarce in that mighty plain.\r\n\r\nThe sidewalk was of boards that were more or less loose and inclined to\r\nrattle when walked upon. In the middle of the town, opposite the stores,\r\nwas the \xe2\x80\x9cplaza\xe2\x80\x9d which is native to all towns beyond the Rocky\r\nMountains\xe2\x80\x94a large, unfenced, level vacancy, with a liberty pole in it,\r\nand very useful as a place for public auctions, horse trades, and mass\r\nmeetings, and likewise for teamsters to camp in. Two other sides of the\r\nplaza were faced by stores, offices and stables.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Carson City was pretty scattering.\r\n\r\nWe were introduced to several citizens, at the stage-office and on the\r\nway up to the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s from the hotel\xe2\x80\x94among others, to a Mr. Harris,\r\nwho was on horseback; he began to say something, but interrupted himself\r\nwith the remark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get you to excuse me a minute; yonder is the witness that\r\nswore I helped to rob the California coach\xe2\x80\x94a piece of impertinent\r\nintermeddling, sir, for I am not even acquainted with the man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he rode over and began to rebuke the stranger with a six-shooter,\r\nand the stranger began to explain with another. When the pistols were\r\nemptied, the stranger resumed his work (mending a whip-lash), and Mr.\r\nHarris rode by with a polite nod, homeward bound, with a bullet through\r\none of his lungs, and several in his hips; and from them issued little\r\nrivulets of blood that coursed down the horse\xe2\x80\x99s sides and made the\r\nanimal look quite picturesque. I never saw Harris shoot a man after that\r\nbut it recalled to mind that first day in Carson.\r\n\r\nThis was all we saw that day, for it was two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, now, and according\r\nto custom the daily \xe2\x80\x9cWashoe Zephyr\xe2\x80\x9d set in; a soaring dust-drift about\r\nthe size of the United States set up edgewise came with it, and the\r\ncapital of Nevada Territory disappeared from view.\r\n\r\nStill, there were sights to be seen which were not wholly uninteresting\r\nto new comers; for the vast dust cloud was thickly freckled with things\r\nstrange to the upper air\xe2\x80\x94things living and dead, that flitted hither and\r\nthither, going and coming, appearing and disappearing among the rolling\r\nbillows of dust\xe2\x80\x94hats, chickens and parasols sailing in the remote\r\nheavens; blankets, tin signs, sage-brush and shingles a shade lower;\r\ndoor-mats and buffalo robes lower still; shovels and coal scuttles on\r\nthe next grade; glass doors, cats and little children on the next;\r\ndisrupted lumber yards, light buggies and wheelbarrows on the next; and\r\ndown only thirty or forty feet above ground was a scurrying storm of\r\nemigrating roofs and vacant lots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n159.jpg (92K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was something to see that much. I could have seen more, if I could\r\nhave kept the dust out of my eyes.\r\n\r\nBut seriously a Washoe wind is by no means a trifling matter. It blows\r\nflimsy houses down, lifts shingle roofs occasionally, rolls up tin ones\r\nlike sheet music, now and then blows a stage coach over and spills the\r\npassengers; and tradition says the reason there are so many bald people\r\nthere, is, that the wind blows the hair off their heads while they are\r\nlooking skyward after their hats. Carson streets seldom look inactive on\r\nSummer afternoons, because there are so many citizens skipping around\r\ntheir escaping hats, like chambermaids trying to head off a spider.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cWashoe Zephyr\xe2\x80\x9d (Washoe is a pet nickname for Nevada) is a peculiar\r\nScriptural wind, in that no man knoweth \xe2\x80\x9cwhence it cometh.\xe2\x80\x9d That is to\r\nsay, where it _originates_. It comes right over the mountains from the\r\nWest, but when one crosses the ridge he does not find any of it on the\r\nother side! It probably is manufactured on the mountain-top for the\r\noccasion, and starts from there. It is a pretty regular wind, in the\r\nsummer time. Its office hours are from two in the afternoon till two the\r\nnext morning; and anybody venturing abroad during those twelve hours\r\nneeds to allow for the wind or he will bring up a mile or two to leeward\r\nof the point he is aiming at. And yet the first complaint a Washoe\r\nvisitor to San Francisco makes, is that the sea winds blow so, there!\r\nThere is a good deal of human nature in that.\r\n\r\nWe found the state palace of the Governor of Nevada Territory to consist\r\nof a white frame one-story house with two small rooms in it and a\r\nstanchion supported shed in front\xe2\x80\x94for grandeur\xe2\x80\x94it compelled the respect\r\nof the citizen and inspired the Indians with awe. The newly arrived\r\nChief and Associate Justices of the Territory, and other machinery of\r\nthe government, were domiciled with less splendor. They were boarding\r\naround privately, and had their offices in their bedrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n161.jpg (63K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Secretary and I took quarters in the \xe2\x80\x9cranch\xe2\x80\x9d of a worthy French lady\r\nby the name of Bridget O\xe2\x80\x99Flannigan, a camp follower of his Excellency\r\nthe Governor. She had known him in his prosperity as commander-in-chief\r\nof the Metropolitan Police of New York, and she would not desert him in\r\nhis adversity as Governor of Nevada.\r\n\r\nOur room was on the lower floor, facing the plaza, and when we had got\r\nour bed, a small table, two chairs, the government fire-proof safe, and\r\nthe Unabridged Dictionary into it, there was still room enough left for\r\na visitor\xe2\x80\x94may be two, but not without straining the walls. But the walls\r\ncould stand it\xe2\x80\x94at least the partitions could, for they consisted simply\r\nof one thickness of white \xe2\x80\x9ccotton domestic\xe2\x80\x9d stretched from corner to\r\ncorner of the room. This was the rule in Carson\xe2\x80\x94any other kind of\r\npartition was the rare exception. And if you stood in a dark room and\r\nyour neighbors in the next had lights, the shadows on your canvas told\r\nqueer secrets sometimes! Very often these partitions were made of old\r\nflour sacks basted together; and then the difference between the common\r\nherd and the aristocracy was, that the common herd had unornamented\r\nsacks, while the walls of the aristocrat were overpowering with\r\nrudimental fresco\xe2\x80\x94_i.e._, red and blue mill brands on the flour sacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n162.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOccasionally, also, the better classes embellished their canvas by\r\npasting pictures from _Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly_ on them. In many cases, too, the\r\nwealthy and the cultured rose to spittoons and other evidences of a\r\nsumptuous and luxurious taste. [Washoe people take a joke so hard that I\r\nmust explain that the above description was only the rule; there were\r\nmany honorable exceptions in Carson\xe2\x80\x94plastered ceilings and houses that\r\nhad considerable furniture in them.\xe2\x80\x94M. T.]\r\n\r\nWe had a carpet and a genuine queen\xe2\x80\x99s-ware washbowl. Consequently we\r\nwere hated without reserve by the other tenants of the O\xe2\x80\x99Flannigan\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cranch.\xe2\x80\x9d When we added a painted oilcloth window curtain, we simply took\r\nour lives into our own hands. To prevent bloodshed I removed up stairs\r\nand took up quarters with the untitled plebeians in one of the fourteen\r\nwhite pine cot-bedsteads that stood in two long ranks in the one sole\r\nroom of which the second story consisted.\r\n\r\nIt was a jolly company, the fourteen. They were principally voluntary\r\ncamp-followers of the Governor, who had joined his retinue by their own\r\nelection at New York and San Francisco and came along, feeling that in\r\nthe scuffle for little territorial crumbs and offices they could not\r\nmake their condition more precarious than it was, and might reasonably\r\nexpect to make it better. They were popularly known as the \xe2\x80\x9cIrish\r\nBrigade,\xe2\x80\x9d though there were only four or five Irishmen among all the\r\nGovernor\xe2\x80\x99s retainers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n163.jpg (95K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis good-natured Excellency was much annoyed at the gossip his henchmen\r\ncreated\xe2\x80\x94especially when there arose a rumor that they were paid\r\nassassins of his, brought along to quietly reduce the democratic vote\r\nwhen desirable!\r\n\r\nMrs. O\xe2\x80\x99Flannigan was boarding and lodging them at ten dollars a week\r\napiece, and they were cheerfully giving their notes for it. They were\r\nperfectly satisfied, but Bridget presently found that notes that could\r\nnot be discounted were but a feeble constitution for a Carson boarding-\r\nhouse. So she began to harry the Governor to find employment for the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrigade.\xe2\x80\x9d Her importunities and theirs together drove him to a gentle\r\ndesperation at last, and he finally summoned the Brigade to the\r\npresence. Then, said he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I have planned a lucrative and useful service for you\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nservice which will provide you with recreation amid noble landscapes,\r\nand afford you never ceasing opportunities for enriching your minds by\r\nobservation and study. I want you to survey a railroad from Carson City\r\nwestward to a certain point! When the legislature meets I will have the\r\nnecessary bill passed and the remuneration arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, a railroad over the Sierra Nevada Mountains?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, survey it eastward to a certain point!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe converted them into surveyors, chain-bearers and so on, and turned\r\nthem loose in the desert. It was \xe2\x80\x9crecreation\xe2\x80\x9d with a vengeance!\r\nRecreation on foot, lugging chains through sand and sage-brush, under a\r\nsultry sun and among cattle bones, cayotes and tarantulas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n164.jpg (15K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRomantic adventure\xe2\x80\x9d could go no further. They surveyed very slowly,\r\nvery deliberately, very carefully. They returned every night during the\r\nfirst week, dusty, footsore, tired, and hungry, but very jolly. They\r\nbrought in great store of prodigious hairy spiders\xe2\x80\x94tarantulas\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nimprisoned them in covered tumblers up stairs in the \xe2\x80\x9cranch.\xe2\x80\x9d After the\r\nfirst week, they had to camp on the field, for they were getting well\r\neastward. They made a good many inquiries as to the location of that\r\nindefinite \xe2\x80\x9ccertain point,\xe2\x80\x9d but got no information. At last, to a\r\npeculiarly urgent inquiry of \xe2\x80\x9cHow far eastward?\xe2\x80\x9d Governor Nye\r\ntelegraphed back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the Atlantic Ocean, blast you!\xe2\x80\x94and then bridge it and go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis brought back the dusty toilers, who sent in a report and ceased\r\nfrom their labors. The Governor was always comfortable about it; he said\r\nMrs. O\xe2\x80\x99Flannigan would hold him for the Brigade\xe2\x80\x99s board anyhow, and he\r\nintended to get what entertainment he could out of the boys; he said,\r\nwith his old-time pleasant twinkle, that he meant to survey them into\r\nUtah and then telegraph Brigham to hang them for trespass!\r\n\r\nThe surveyors brought back more tarantulas with them, and so we had\r\nquite a menagerie arranged along the shelves of the room. Some of these\r\nspiders could straddle over a common saucer with their hairy, muscular\r\nlegs, and when their feelings were hurt, or their dignity offended, they\r\nwere the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can furnish. If\r\ntheir glass prison-houses were touched ever so lightly they were up and\r\nspoiling for a fight in a minute. Starchy?\xe2\x80\x94proud? Indeed, they would\r\ntake up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress. There\r\nwas as usual a furious \xe2\x80\x9czephyr\xe2\x80\x9d blowing the first night of the brigade\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn, and about midnight the roof of an adjoining stable blew off, and\r\na corner of it came crashing through the side of our ranch. There was a\r\nsimultaneous awakening, and a tumultuous muster of the brigade in the\r\ndark, and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other in the narrow\r\naisle between the bedrows. In the midst of the turmoil, Bob H\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94sprung up\r\nout of a sound sleep, and knocked down a shelf with his head. Instantly\r\nhe shouted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTurn out, boys\xe2\x80\x94the tarantulas is loose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n165.jpg (15K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo warning ever sounded so dreadful. Nobody tried, any longer, to leave\r\nthe room, lest he might step on a tarantula. Every man groped for a\r\ntrunk or a bed, and jumped on it. Then followed the strangest silence\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsilence of grisly suspense it was, too\xe2\x80\x94waiting, expectancy, fear. It was\r\nas dark as pitch, and one had to imagine the spectacle of those fourteen\r\nscant-clad men roosting gingerly on trunks and beds, for not a thing\r\ncould be seen. Then came occasional little interruptions of the silence,\r\nand one could recognize a man and tell his locality by his voice, or\r\nlocate any other sound a sufferer made by his gropings or changes of\r\nposition. The occasional voices were not given to much speaking\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nsimply heard a gentle ejaculation of \xe2\x80\x9cOw!\xe2\x80\x9d followed by a solid thump,\r\nand you knew the gentleman had felt a hairy blanket or something touch\r\nhis bare skin and had skipped from a bed to the floor. Another silence.\r\nPresently you would hear a gasping voice say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSu-su-something\xe2\x80\x99s crawling up the back of my neck!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery now and then you could hear a little subdued scramble and a\r\nsorrowful \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d and then you knew that somebody was getting away\r\nfrom something he took for a tarantula, and not losing any time about\r\nit, either. Directly a voice in the corner rang out wild and clear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got him! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him!\xe2\x80\x9d [Pause, and probable change of\r\ncircumstances.] \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s got me! Oh, ain\xe2\x80\x99t they never going to fetch a\r\nlantern!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n166.jpg (89K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lantern came at that moment, in the hands of Mrs. O\xe2\x80\x99Flannigan, whose\r\nanxiety to know the amount of damage done by the assaulting roof had not\r\nprevented her waiting a judicious interval, after getting out of bed and\r\nlighting up, to see if the wind was done, now, up stairs, or had a\r\nlarger contract.\r\n\r\nThe landscape presented when the lantern flashed into the room was\r\npicturesque, and might have been funny to some people, but was not to\r\nus. Although we were perched so strangely upon boxes, trunks and beds,\r\nand so strangely attired, too, we were too earnestly distressed and too\r\ngenuinely miserable to see any fun about it, and there was not the\r\nsemblance of a smile anywhere visible. I know I am not capable of\r\nsuffering more than I did during those few minutes of suspense in the\r\ndark, surrounded by those creeping, bloody-minded tarantulas. I had\r\nskipped from bed to bed and from box to box in a cold agony, and every\r\ntime I touched anything that was furzy I fancied I felt the fangs. I had\r\nrather go to war than live that episode over again. Nobody was hurt. The\r\nman who thought a tarantula had \xe2\x80\x9cgot him\xe2\x80\x9d was mistaken\xe2\x80\x94only a crack in a\r\nbox had caught his finger. Not one of those escaped tarantulas was ever\r\nseen again. There were ten or twelve of them. We took candles and hunted\r\nthe place high and low for them, but with no success. Did we go back to\r\nbed then? We did nothing of the kind. Money could not have persuaded us\r\nto do it. We sat up the rest of the night playing cribbage and keeping a\r\nsharp lookout for the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the end of August, and the skies were cloudless and the weather\r\nsuperb. In two or three weeks I had grown wonderfully fascinated with\r\nthe curious new country and concluded to put off my return to \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nStates\xe2\x80\x9d awhile. I had grown well accustomed to wearing a damaged slouch\r\nhat, blue woolen shirt, and pants crammed into boot-tops, and gloried in\r\nthe absence of coat, vest and braces. I felt rowdyish and \xe2\x80\x9cbully,\xe2\x80\x9d (as\r\nthe historian Josephus phrases it, in his fine chapter upon the\r\ndestruction of the Temple). It seemed to me that nothing could be so\r\nfine and so romantic. I had become an officer of the government, but\r\nthat was for mere sublimity. The office was an unique sinecure. I had\r\nnothing to do and no salary. I was private Secretary to his majesty the\r\nSecretary and there was not yet writing enough for two of us. So Johnny\r\nK\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94and I devoted our time to amusement. He was the young son of an Ohio\r\nnabob and was out there for recreation. He got it. We had heard a world\r\nof talk about the marvellous beauty of Lake Tahoe, and finally curiosity\r\ndrove us thither to see it. Three or four members of the Brigade had\r\nbeen there and located some timber lands on its shores and stored up a\r\nquantity of provisions in their camp. We strapped a couple of blankets\r\non our shoulders and took an axe apiece and started\xe2\x80\x94for we intended to\r\ntake up a wood ranch or so ourselves and become wealthy. We were on\r\nfoot. The reader will find it advantageous to go horseback. We were told\r\nthat the distance was eleven miles. We tramped a long time on level\r\nground, and then toiled laboriously up a mountain about a thousand miles\r\nhigh and looked over. No lake there. We descended on the other side,\r\ncrossed the valley and toiled up another mountain three or four thousand\r\nmiles high, apparently, and looked over again. No lake yet. We sat down\r\ntired and perspiring, and hired a couple of Chinamen to curse those\r\npeople who had beguiled us. Thus refreshed, we presently resumed the\r\nmarch with renewed vigor and determination. We plodded on, two or three\r\nhours longer, and at last the Lake burst upon us\xe2\x80\x94a noble sheet of blue\r\nwater lifted six thousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand walled in by a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft\r\nfull three thousand feet higher still! It was a vast oval, and one would\r\nhave to use up eighty or a hundred good miles in traveling around it. As\r\nit lay there with the shadows of the mountains brilliantly photographed\r\nupon its still surface I thought it must surely be the fairest picture\r\nthe whole earth affords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n169.jpg (80K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found the small skiff belonging to the Brigade boys, and without loss\r\nof time set out across a deep bend of the lake toward the landmarks that\r\nsignified the locality of the camp. I got Johnny to row\xe2\x80\x94not because I\r\nmind exertion myself, but because it makes me sick to ride backwards\r\nwhen I am at work. But I steered. A three-mile pull brought us to the\r\ncamp just as the night fell, and we stepped ashore very tired and\r\nwolfishly hungry. In a \xe2\x80\x9ccache\xe2\x80\x9d among the rocks we found the provisions\r\nand the cooking utensils, and then, all fatigued as I was, I sat down on\r\na boulder and superintended while Johnny gathered wood and cooked\r\nsupper. Many a man who had gone through what I had, would have wanted to\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicious supper\xe2\x80\x94hot bread, fried bacon, and black coffee. It\r\nwas a delicious solitude we were in, too. Three miles away was a saw-\r\nmill and some workmen, but there were not fifteen other human beings\r\nthroughout the wide circumference of the lake. As the darkness closed\r\ndown and the stars came out and spangled the great mirror with jewels,\r\nwe smoked meditatively in the solemn hush and forgot our troubles and\r\nour pains. In due time we spread our blankets in the warm sand between\r\ntwo large boulders and soon feel asleep, careless of the procession of\r\nants that passed in through rents in our clothing and explored our\r\npersons. Nothing could disturb the sleep that fettered us, for it had\r\nbeen fairly earned, and if our consciences had any sins on them they had\r\nto adjourn court for that night, any way. The wind rose just as we were\r\nlosing consciousness, and we were lulled to sleep by the beating of the\r\nsurf upon the shore.\r\n\r\nIt is always very cold on that lake shore in the night, but we had\r\nplenty of blankets and were warm enough. We never moved a muscle all\r\nnight, but waked at early dawn in the original positions, and got up at\r\nonce, thoroughly refreshed, free from soreness, and brim full of\r\nfriskiness. There is no end of wholesome medicine in such an experience.\r\nThat morning we could have whipped ten such people as we were the day\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94sick ones at any rate. But the world is slow, and people will go\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cwater cures\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmovement cures\xe2\x80\x9d and to foreign lands for health.\r\nThree months of camp life on Lake Tahoe would restore an Egyptian mummy\r\nto his pristine vigor, and give him an appetite like an alligator. I do\r\nnot mean the oldest and driest mummies, of course, but the fresher ones.\r\nThe air up there in the clouds is very pure and fine, bracing and\r\ndelicious. And why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be?\xe2\x80\x94it is the same the angels breathe. I\r\nthink that hardly any amount of fatigue can be gathered together that a\r\nman cannot sleep off in one night on the sand by its side. Not under a\r\nroof, but under the sky; it seldom or never rains there in the summer\r\ntime. I know a man who went there to die. But he made a failure of it.\r\nHe was a skeleton when he came, and could barely stand. He had no\r\nappetite, and did nothing but read tracts and reflect on the future.\r\nThree months later he was sleeping out of doors regularly, eating all he\r\ncould hold, three times a day, and chasing game over mountains three\r\nthousand feet high for recreation. And he was a skeleton no longer, but\r\nweighed part of a ton. This is no fancy sketch, but the truth. His\r\ndisease was consumption. I confidently commend his experience to other\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\n\r\n170.jpg (19K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n171.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\nI superintended again, and as soon as we had eaten breakfast we got in\r\nthe boat and skirted along the lake shore about three miles and\r\ndisembarked. We liked the appearance of the place, and so we claimed\r\nsome three hundred acres of it and stuck our \xe2\x80\x9cnotices\xe2\x80\x9d on a tree. It was\r\nyellow pine timber land\xe2\x80\x94a dense forest of trees a hundred feet high and\r\nfrom one to five feet through at the butt. It was necessary to fence our\r\nproperty or we could not hold it. That is to say, it was necessary to\r\ncut down trees here and there and make them fall in such a way as to\r\nform a sort of enclosure (with pretty wide gaps in it). We cut down\r\nthree trees apiece, and found it such heart-breaking work that we\r\ndecided to \xe2\x80\x9crest our case\xe2\x80\x9d on those; if they held the property, well and\r\ngood; if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, let the property spill out through the gaps and\r\ngo; it was no use to work ourselves to death merely to save a few acres\r\nof land. Next day we came back to build a house\xe2\x80\x94for a house was also\r\nnecessary, in order to hold the property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n172.jpg (142K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe decided to build a substantial log-house and excite the envy of the\r\nBrigade boys; but by the time we had cut and trimmed the first log it\r\nseemed unnecessary to be so elaborate, and so we concluded to build it\r\nof saplings. However, two saplings, duly cut and trimmed, compelled\r\nrecognition of the fact that a still modester architecture would satisfy\r\nthe law, and so we concluded to build a \xe2\x80\x9cbrush\xe2\x80\x9d house. We devoted the\r\nnext day to this work, but we did so much \xe2\x80\x9csitting around\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\ndiscussing, that by the middle of the afternoon we had achieved only a\r\nhalf-way sort of affair which one of us had to watch while the other cut\r\nbrush, lest if both turned our backs we might not be able to find it\r\nagain, it had such a strong family resemblance to the surrounding\r\nvegetation. But we were satisfied with it.\r\n\r\nWe were land owners now, duly seized and possessed, and within the\r\nprotection of the law. Therefore we decided to take up our residence on\r\nour own domain and enjoy that large sense of independence which only\r\nsuch an experience can bring. Late the next afternoon, after a good long\r\nrest, we sailed away from the Brigade camp with all the provisions and\r\ncooking utensils we could carry off\xe2\x80\x94borrow is the more accurate word\xe2\x80\x94and\r\njust as the night was falling we beached the boat at our own landing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is any life that is happier than the life we led on our timber\r\nranch for the next two or three weeks, it must be a sort of life which I\r\nhave not read of in books or experienced in person. We did not see a\r\nhuman being but ourselves during the time, or hear any sounds but those\r\nthat were made by the wind and the waves, the sighing of the pines, and\r\nnow and then the far-off thunder of an avalanche. The forest about us\r\nwas dense and cool, the sky above us was cloudless and brilliant with\r\nsunshine, the broad lake before us was glassy and clear, or rippled and\r\nbreezy, or black and storm-tossed, according to Nature\xe2\x80\x99s mood; and its\r\ncircling border of mountain domes, clothed with forests, scarred with\r\nland-slides, cloven by ca\xc3\xb1ons and valleys, and helmeted with glittering\r\nsnow, fitly framed and finished the noble picture. The view was always\r\nfascinating, bewitching, entrancing. The eye was never tired of gazing,\r\nnight or day, in calm or storm; it suffered but one grief, and that was\r\nthat it could not look always, but must close sometimes in sleep.\r\n\r\nWe slept in the sand close to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, between two protecting\r\nboulders, which took care of the stormy night-winds for us. We never\r\ntook any paregoric to make us sleep. At the first break of dawn we were\r\nalways up and running foot-races to tone down excess of physical vigor\r\nand exuberance of spirits. That is, Johnny was\xe2\x80\x94but I held his hat. While\r\nsmoking the pipe of peace after breakfast we watched the sentinel peaks\r\nput on the glory of the sun, and followed the conquering light as it\r\nswept down among the shadows, and set the captive crags and forests\r\nfree. We watched the tinted pictures grow and brighten upon the water\r\ntill every little detail of forest, precipice and pinnacle was wrought\r\nin and finished, and the miracle of the enchanter complete. Then to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n174.jpg (84K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is, drifting around in the boat. We were on the north shore. There,\r\nthe rocks on the bottom are sometimes gray, sometimes white. This gives\r\nthe marvelous transparency of the water a fuller advantage than it has\r\nelsewhere on the lake. We usually pushed out a hundred yards or so from\r\nshore, and then lay down on the thwarts, in the sun, and let the boat\r\ndrift by the hour whither it would. We seldom talked. It interrupted the\r\nSabbath stillness, and marred the dreams the luxurious rest and\r\nindolence brought. The shore all along was indented with deep, curved\r\nbays and coves, bordered by narrow sand-beaches; and where the sand\r\nended, the steep mountain-sides rose right up aloft into space\xe2\x80\x94rose up\r\nlike a vast wall a little out of the perpendicular, and thickly wooded\r\nwith tall pines.\r\n\r\nSo singularly clear was the water, that where it was only twenty or\r\nthirty feet deep the bottom was so perfectly distinct that the boat\r\nseemed floating in the air! Yes, where it was even _eighty_ feet deep.\r\nEvery little pebble was distinct, every speckled trout, every hand\xe2\x80\x99s-\r\nbreadth of sand. Often, as we lay on our faces, a granite boulder, as\r\nlarge as a village church, would start out of the bottom apparently, and\r\nseem climbing up rapidly to the surface, till presently it threatened to\r\ntouch our faces, and we could not resist the impulse to seize an oar and\r\navert the danger. But the boat would float on, and the boulder descend\r\nagain, and then we could see that when we had been exactly above it, it\r\nmust still have been twenty or thirty feet below the surface. Down\r\nthrough the transparency of these great depths, the water was not\r\n_merely_ transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so. All objects seen\r\nthrough it had a bright, strong vividness, not only of outline, but of\r\nevery minute detail, which they would not have had when seen simply\r\nthrough the same depth of atmosphere. So empty and airy did all spaces\r\nseem below us, and so strong was the sense of floating high aloft in\r\nmid-nothingness, that we called these boat-excursions \xe2\x80\x9cballoon-voyages.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe fished a good deal, but we did not average one fish a week. We could\r\nsee trout by the thousand winging about in the emptiness under us, or\r\nsleeping in shoals on the bottom, but they would not bite\xe2\x80\x94they could see\r\nthe line too plainly, perhaps. We frequently selected the trout we\r\nwanted, and rested the bait patiently and persistently on the end of his\r\nnose at a depth of eighty feet, but he would only shake it off with an\r\nannoyed manner, and shift his position.\r\n\r\nWe bathed occasionally, but the water was rather chilly, for all it\r\nlooked so sunny. Sometimes we rowed out to the \xe2\x80\x9cblue water,\xe2\x80\x9d a mile or\r\ntwo from shore. It was as dead blue as indigo there, because of the\r\nimmense depth. By official measurement the lake in its centre is one\r\nthousand five hundred and twenty-five feet deep!\r\n\r\nSometimes, on lazy afternoons, we lolled on the sand in camp, and smoked\r\npipes and read some old well-worn novels. At night, by the camp-fire, we\r\nplayed euchre and seven-up to strengthen the mind\xe2\x80\x94and played them with\r\ncards so greasy and defaced that only a whole summer\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance with\r\nthem could enable the student to tell the ace of clubs from the jack of\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nWe never slept in our \xe2\x80\x9chouse.\xe2\x80\x9d It never recurred to us, for one thing;\r\nand besides, it was built to hold the ground, and that was enough. We\r\ndid not wish to strain it.\r\n\r\nBy and by our provisions began to run short, and we went back to the old\r\ncamp and laid in a new supply. We were gone all day, and reached home\r\nagain about night-fall, pretty tired and hungry. While Johnny was\r\ncarrying the main bulk of the provisions up to our \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d for future\r\nuse, I took the loaf of bread, some slices of bacon, and the coffee-pot,\r\nashore, set them down by a tree, lit a fire, and went back to the boat\r\nto get the frying-pan. While I was at this, I heard a shout from Johnny,\r\nand looking up I saw that my fire was galloping all over the premises!\r\nJohnny was on the other side of it. He had to run through the flames to\r\nget to the lake shore, and then we stood helpless and watched the\r\ndevastation.\r\n\r\nThe ground was deeply carpeted with dry pine-needles, and the fire\r\ntouched them off as if they were gunpowder. It was wonderful to see with\r\nwhat fierce speed the tall sheet of flame traveled! My coffee-pot was\r\ngone, and everything with it. In a minute and a half the fire seized\r\nupon a dense growth of dry manzanita chapparal six or eight feet high,\r\nand then the roaring and popping and crackling was something terrific.\r\nWe were driven to the boat by the intense heat, and there we remained,\r\nspell-bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n176.jpg (161K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour all before us was a tossing, blinding tempest of\r\nflame! It went surging up adjacent ridges\xe2\x80\x94surmounted them and\r\ndisappeared in the ca\xc3\xb1ons beyond\xe2\x80\x94burst into view upon higher and farther\r\nridges, presently\xe2\x80\x94shed a grander illumination abroad, and dove\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94flamed out again, directly, higher and still higher up the\r\nmountain-side threw out skirmishing parties of fire here and there, and\r\nsent them trailing their crimson spirals away among remote ramparts and\r\nribs and gorges, till as far as the eye could reach the lofty mountain-\r\nfronts were webbed as it were with a tangled network of red lava\r\nstreams. Away across the water the crags and domes were lit with a ruddy\r\nglare, and the firmament above was a reflected hell!\r\n\r\nEvery feature of the spectacle was repeated in the glowing mirror of the\r\nlake! Both pictures were sublime, both were beautiful; but that in the\r\nlake had a bewildering richness about it that enchanted the eye and held\r\nit with the stronger fascination.\r\n\r\nWe sat absorbed and motionless through four long hours. We never thought\r\nof supper, and never felt fatigue. But at eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the\r\nconflagration had traveled beyond our range of vision, and then darkness\r\nstole down upon the landscape again.\r\n\r\nHunger asserted itself now, but there was nothing to eat. The provisions\r\nwere all cooked, no doubt, but we did not go to see. We were homeless\r\nwanderers again, without any property. Our fence was gone, our house\r\nburned down; no insurance. Our pine forest was well scorched, the dead\r\ntrees all burned up, and our broad acres of manzanita swept away. Our\r\nblankets were on our usual sand-bed, however, and so we lay down and\r\nwent to sleep. The next morning we started back to the old camp, but\r\nwhile out a long way from shore, so great a storm came up that we dared\r\nnot try to land. So I baled out the seas we shipped, and Johnny pulled\r\nheavily through the billows till we had reached a point three or four\r\nmiles beyond the camp. The storm was increasing, and it became evident\r\nthat it was better to take the hazard of beaching the boat than go down\r\nin a hundred fathoms of water; so we ran in, with tall white-caps\r\nfollowing, and I sat down in the stern-sheets and pointed her head-on to\r\nthe shore. The instant the bow struck, a wave came over the stern that\r\nwashed crew and cargo ashore, and saved a deal of trouble. We shivered\r\nin the lee of a boulder all the rest of the day, and froze all the night\r\nthrough. In the morning the tempest had gone down, and we paddled down\r\nto the camp without any unnecessary delay. We were so starved that we\r\nate up the rest of the Brigade\xe2\x80\x99s provisions, and then set out to Carson\r\nto tell them about it and ask their forgiveness. It was accorded, upon\r\npayment of damages.\r\n\r\nWe made many trips to the lake after that, and had many a hair-breadth\r\nescape and blood-curdling adventure which will never be recorded in any\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI resolved to have a horse to ride. I had never seen such wild, free,\r\nmagnificent horsemanship outside of a circus as these picturesquely-clad\r\nMexicans, Californians and Mexicanized Americans displayed in Carson\r\nstreets every day. How they rode! Leaning just gently forward out of the\r\nperpendicular, easy and nonchalant, with broad slouch-hat brim blown\r\nsquare up in front, and long _riata_ swinging above the head as they\r\nswept through the town like the wind! The next minute they were only a\r\nsailing puff of dust on the far desert. If they trotted, they sat up\r\ngallantly and gracefully, and seemed part of the horse; did not go\r\njiggering up and down after the silly Miss-Nancy fashion of the riding-\r\nschools. I had quickly learned to tell a horse from a cow, and was full\r\nof anxiety to learn more. I was resolved to buy a horse.\r\n\r\nWhile the thought was rankling in my mind, the auctioneer came skurrying\r\nthrough the plaza on a black beast that had as many humps and corners on\r\nhim as a dromedary, and was necessarily uncomely; but he was \xe2\x80\x9cgoing,\r\ngoing, at twenty-two!\xe2\x80\x94horse, saddle and bridle at twenty-two dollars,\r\ngentlemen!\xe2\x80\x9d and I could hardly resist.\r\n\r\nA man whom I did not know (he turned out to be the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s brother)\r\nnoticed the wistful look in my eye, and observed that that was a very\r\nremarkable horse to be going at such a price; and added that the saddle\r\nalone was worth the money. It was a Spanish saddle, with ponderous\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_tapidaros_\xe2\x80\x99, and furnished with the ungainly sole-leather covering\r\nwith the unspellable name. I said I had half a notion to bid. Then this\r\nkeen-eyed person appeared to me to be \xe2\x80\x9ctaking my measure\xe2\x80\x9d; but I\r\ndismissed the suspicion when he spoke, for his manner was full of\r\nguileless candor and truthfulness. Said he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that horse\xe2\x80\x94know him well. You are a stranger, I take it, and so\r\nyou might think he was an American horse, maybe, but I assure you he is\r\nnot. He is nothing of the kind; but\xe2\x80\x94excuse my speaking in a low voice,\r\nother people being near\xe2\x80\x94he is, without the shadow of a doubt, a Genuine\r\nMexican Plug!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n179.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not know what a Genuine Mexican Plug was, but there was something\r\nabout this man\xe2\x80\x99s way of saying it, that made me swear inwardly that I\r\nwould own a Genuine Mexican Plug, or die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas he any other\xe2\x80\x94er\xe2\x80\x94advantages?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired, suppressing what eagerness\r\nI could.\r\n\r\nHe hooked his forefinger in the pocket of my army-shirt, led me to one\r\nside, and breathed in my ear impressively these words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe can out-buck anything in America!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing, going, going\xe2\x80\x94at twent\xe2\x80\x94ty\xe2\x80\x94four dollars and a half, gen\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-seven!\xe2\x80\x9d I shouted, in a frenzy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd sold!\xe2\x80\x9d said the auctioneer, and passed over the Genuine Mexican\r\nPlug to me.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely contain my exultation. I paid the money, and put the\r\nanimal in a neighboring livery-stable to dine and rest himself.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I brought the creature into the plaza, and certain\r\ncitizens held him by the head, and others by the tail, while I mounted\r\nhim. As soon as they let go, he placed all his feet in a bunch together,\r\nlowered his back, and then suddenly arched it upward, and shot me\r\nstraight into the air a matter of three or four feet! I came as straight\r\ndown again, lit in the saddle, went instantly up again, came down almost\r\non the high pommel, shot up again, and came down on the horse\xe2\x80\x99s neck\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nin the space of three or four seconds. Then he rose and stood almost\r\nstraight up on his hind feet, and I, clasping his lean neck desperately,\r\nslid back into the saddle and held on. He came down, and immediately\r\nhoisted his heels into the air, delivering a vicious kick at the sky,\r\nand stood on his forefeet. And then down he came once more, and began\r\nthe original exercise of shooting me straight up again. The third time I\r\nwent up I heard a stranger say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n180.jpg (50K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, don\xe2\x80\x99t he _buck,_ though!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile I was up, somebody struck the horse a sounding thwack with a\r\nleathern strap, and when I arrived again the Genuine Mexican Plug was\r\nnot there. A California youth chased him up and caught him, and asked if\r\nhe might have a ride. I granted him that luxury. He mounted the Genuine,\r\ngot lifted into the air once, but sent his spurs home as he descended,\r\nand the horse darted away like a telegram. He soared over three fences\r\nlike a bird, and disappeared down the road toward the Washoe Valley.\r\n\r\nI sat down on a stone, with a sigh, and by a natural impulse one of my\r\nhands sought my forehead, and the other the base of my stomach. I\r\nbelieve I never appreciated, till then, the poverty of the human\r\nmachinery\xe2\x80\x94for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere. Pen\r\ncannot describe how I was jolted up. Imagination cannot conceive how\r\ndisjointed I was\xe2\x80\x94how internally, externally and universally I was\r\nunsettled, mixed up and ruptured. There was a sympathetic crowd around\r\nme, though.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n181.jpg (38K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne elderly-looking comforter said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStranger, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been taken in. Everybody in this camp knows that\r\nhorse. Any child, any Injun, could have told you that he\xe2\x80\x99d buck; he is\r\nthe very worst devil to buck on the continent of America. You hear _me_.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m Curry. _Old_ Curry. Old _Abe_ Curry. And moreover, he is a simon-\r\npure, out-and-out, genuine d\xe2\x80\x94d Mexican plug, and an uncommon mean one at\r\nthat, too. Why, you turnip, if you had laid low and kept dark, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchances to buy an _American_ horse for mighty little more than you paid\r\nfor that bloody old foreign relic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI gave no sign; but I made up my mind that if the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s brother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfuneral took place while I was in the Territory I would postpone all\r\nother recreations and attend it.\r\n\r\nAfter a gallop of sixteen miles the Californian youth and the Genuine\r\nMexican Plug came tearing into town again, shedding foam-flakes like the\r\nspume-spray that drives before a typhoon, and, with one final skip over\r\na wheelbarrow and a Chinaman, cast anchor in front of the \xe2\x80\x9cranch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n182.jpg (45K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch panting and blowing! Such spreading and contracting of the red\r\nequine nostrils, and glaring of the wild equine eye! But was the\r\nimperial beast subjugated? Indeed he was not.\r\n\r\nHis lordship the Speaker of the House thought he was, and mounted him to\r\ngo down to the Capitol; but the first dash the creature made was over a\r\npile of telegraph poles half as high as a church; and his time to the\r\nCapitol\xe2\x80\x94one mile and three quarters\xe2\x80\x94remains unbeaten to this day. But\r\nthen he took an advantage\xe2\x80\x94he left out the mile, and only did the three\r\nquarters. That is to say, he made a straight cut across lots, preferring\r\nfences and ditches to a crooked road; and when the Speaker got to the\r\nCapitol he said he had been in the air so much he felt as if he had made\r\nthe trip on a comet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n183.jpg (50K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Speaker came home afoot for exercise, and got the\r\nGenuine towed back behind a quartz wagon. The next day I loaned the\r\nanimal to the Clerk of the House to go down to the Dana silver mine, six\r\nmiles, and _he_ walked back for exercise, and got the horse towed.\r\nEverybody I loaned him to always walked back; they never could get\r\nenough exercise any other way.\r\n\r\nStill, I continued to loan him to anybody who was willing to borrow him,\r\nmy idea being to get him crippled, and throw him on the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhands, or killed, and make the borrower pay for him. But somehow nothing\r\never happened to him. He took chances that no other horse ever took and\r\nsurvived, but he always came out safe. It was his daily habit to try\r\nexperiments that had always before been considered impossible, but he\r\nalways got through. Sometimes he miscalculated a little, and did not get\r\nhis rider through intact, but _he_ always got through himself. Of course\r\nI had tried to sell him; but that was a stretch of simplicity which met\r\nwith little sympathy. The auctioneer stormed up and down the streets on\r\nhim for four days, dispersing the populace, interrupting business, and\r\ndestroying children, and never got a bid\xe2\x80\x94at least never any but the\r\neighteen-dollar one he hired a notoriously substanceless bummer to make.\r\nThe people only smiled pleasantly, and restrained their desire to buy,\r\nif they had any. Then the auctioneer brought in his bill, and I withdrew\r\nthe horse from the market. We tried to trade him off at private vendue\r\nnext, offering him at a sacrifice for second-hand tombstones, old iron,\r\ntemperance tracts\xe2\x80\x94any kind of property. But holders were stiff, and we\r\nretired from the market again. I never tried to ride the horse any more.\r\nWalking was good enough exercise for a man like me, that had nothing the\r\nmatter with him except ruptures, internal injuries, and such things.\r\nFinally I tried to _give_ him away. But it was a failure. Parties said\r\nearthquakes were handy enough on the Pacific coast\xe2\x80\x94they did not wish to\r\nown one. As a last resort I offered him to the Governor for the use of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBrigade.\xe2\x80\x9d His face lit up eagerly at first, but toned down again,\r\nand he said the thing would be too palpable.\r\n\r\nJust then the livery stable man brought in his bill for six weeks\xe2\x80\x99\r\nkeeping\xe2\x80\x94stall-room for the horse, fifteen dollars; hay for the horse,\r\ntwo hundred and fifty! The Genuine Mexican Plug had eaten a ton of the\r\narticle, and the man said he would have eaten a hundred if he had let\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI will remark here, in all seriousness, that the regular price of hay\r\nduring that year and a part of the next was really two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars a ton. During a part of the previous year it had sold at five\r\nhundred a ton, in _gold_, and during the winter before that there was\r\nsuch scarcity of the article that in several instances small quantities\r\nhad brought eight hundred dollars a ton in coin! The consequence might\r\nbe guessed without my telling it: peopled turned their stock loose to\r\nstarve, and before the spring arrived Carson and Eagle valleys were\r\nalmost literally carpeted with their carcases! Any old settler there\r\nwill verify these statements.\r\n\r\nI managed to pay the livery bill, and that same day I gave the Genuine\r\nMexican Plug to a passing Arkansas emigrant whom fortune delivered into\r\nmy hand. If this ever meets his eye, he will doubtless remember the\r\ndonation.\r\n\r\nNow whoever has had the luck to ride a real Mexican plug will recognize\r\nthe animal depicted in this chapter, and hardly consider him\r\nexaggerated\xe2\x80\x94but the uninitiated will feel justified in regarding his\r\nportrait as a fancy sketch, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally, Nevada was a part of Utah and was called Carson county; and\r\na pretty large county it was, too. Certain of its valleys produced no\r\nend of hay, and this attracted small colonies of Mormon stock-raisers\r\nand farmers to them. A few orthodox Americans straggled in from\r\nCalifornia, but no love was lost between the two classes of colonists.\r\nThere was little or no friendly intercourse; each party staid to itself.\r\nThe Mormons were largely in the majority, and had the additional\r\nadvantage of being peculiarly under the protection of the Mormon\r\ngovernment of the Territory. Therefore they could afford to be distant,\r\nand even peremptory toward their neighbors. One of the traditions of\r\nCarson Valley illustrates the condition of things that prevailed at the\r\ntime I speak of. The hired girl of one of the American families was\r\nIrish, and a Catholic; yet it was noted with surprise that she was the\r\nonly person outside of the Mormon ring who could get favors from the\r\nMormons. She asked kindnesses of them often, and always got them. It was\r\na mystery to everybody. But one day as she was passing out at the door,\r\na large bowie knife dropped from under her apron, and when her mistress\r\nasked for an explanation she observed that she was going out to \xe2\x80\x9cborry a\r\nwash-tub from the Mormons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n186.jpg (88K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1858 silver lodes were discovered in \xe2\x80\x9cCarson County,\xe2\x80\x9d and then the\r\naspect of things changed. Californians began to flock in, and the\r\nAmerican element was soon in the majority. Allegiance to Brigham Young\r\nand Utah was renounced, and a temporary territorial government for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWashoe\xe2\x80\x9d was instituted by the citizens. Governor Roop was the first and\r\nonly chief magistrate of it. In due course of time Congress passed a\r\nbill to organize \xe2\x80\x9cNevada Territory,\xe2\x80\x9d and President Lincoln sent out\r\nGovernor Nye to supplant Roop.\r\n\r\nAt this time the population of the Territory was about twelve or fifteen\r\nthousand, and rapidly increasing. Silver mines were being vigorously\r\ndeveloped and silver mills erected. Business of all kinds was active and\r\nprosperous and growing more so day by day.\r\n\r\nThe people were glad to have a legitimately constituted government, but\r\ndid not particularly enjoy having strangers from distant States put in\r\nauthority over them\xe2\x80\x94a sentiment that was natural enough. They thought\r\nthe officials should have been chosen from among themselves from among\r\nprominent citizens who had earned a right to such promotion, and who\r\nwould be in sympathy with the populace and likewise thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the needs of the Territory. They were right in viewing\r\nthe matter thus, without doubt. The new officers were \xe2\x80\x9cemigrants,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthat was no title to anybody\xe2\x80\x99s affection or admiration either.\r\n\r\nThe new government was received with considerable coolness. It was not\r\nonly a foreign intruder, but a poor one. It was not even worth\r\nplucking\xe2\x80\x94except by the smallest of small fry office-seekers and such.\r\nEverybody knew that Congress had appropriated only twenty thousand\r\ndollars a year in greenbacks for its support\xe2\x80\x94about money enough to run a\r\nquartz mill a month. And everybody knew, also, that the first year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmoney was still in Washington, and that the getting hold of it would be\r\na tedious and difficult process. Carson City was too wary and too wise\r\nto open up a credit account with the imported bantling with anything\r\nlike indecent haste.\r\n\r\nThere is something solemnly funny about the struggles of a new-born\r\nTerritorial government to get a start in this world. Ours had a trying\r\ntime of it. The Organic Act and the \xe2\x80\x9cinstructions\xe2\x80\x9d from the State\r\nDepartment commanded that a legislature should be elected at such-and-\r\nsuch a time, and its sittings inaugurated at such-and-such a date. It\r\nwas easy to get legislators, even at three dollars a day, although board\r\nwas four dollars and fifty cents, for distinction has its charm in\r\nNevada as well as elsewhere, and there were plenty of patriotic souls\r\nout of employment; but to get a legislative hall for them to meet in was\r\nanother matter altogether. Carson blandly declined to give a room rent-\r\nfree, or let one to the government on credit.\r\n\r\nBut when Curry heard of the difficulty, he came forward, solitary and\r\nalone, and shouldered the Ship of State over the bar and got her afloat\r\nagain. I refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCurry\xe2\x80\x94_Old_ Curry\xe2\x80\x94Old _Abe_ Curry.\xe2\x80\x9d But for him the\r\nlegislature would have been obliged to sit in the desert. He offered his\r\nlarge stone building just outside the capital limits, rent-free, and it\r\nwas gladly accepted. Then he built a horse-railroad from town to the\r\ncapitol, and carried the legislators gratis.\r\n\r\nHe also furnished pine benches and chairs for the legislature, and\r\ncovered the floors with clean saw-dust by way of carpet and spittoon\r\ncombined. But for Curry the government would have died in its tender\r\ninfancy. A canvas partition to separate the Senate from the House of\r\nRepresentatives was put up by the Secretary, at a cost of three dollars\r\nand forty cents, but the United States declined to pay for it. Upon\r\nbeing reminded that the \xe2\x80\x9cinstructions\xe2\x80\x9d permitted the payment of a\r\nliberal rent for a legislative hall, and that that money was saved to\r\nthe country by Mr. Curry\xe2\x80\x99s generosity, the United States said that did\r\nnot alter the matter, and the three dollars and forty cents would be\r\nsubtracted from the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s eighteen hundred dollar salary\xe2\x80\x94and it\r\nwas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n188.jpg (30K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter of printing was from the beginning an interesting feature of\r\nthe new government\xe2\x80\x99s difficulties. The Secretary was sworn to obey his\r\nvolume of written \xe2\x80\x9cinstructions,\xe2\x80\x9d and these commanded him to do two\r\ncertain things without fail, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Get the House and Senate journals printed; and, 2. For this work, pay\r\none dollar and fifty cents per \xe2\x80\x9cthousand\xe2\x80\x9d for composition, and one\r\ndollar and fifty cents per \xe2\x80\x9ctoken\xe2\x80\x9d for press-work, in greenbacks.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to swear to do these two things, but it was entirely\r\nimpossible to do more than one of them. When greenbacks had gone down to\r\nforty cents on the dollar, the prices regularly charged everybody by\r\nprinting establishments were one dollar and fifty cents per \xe2\x80\x9cthousand\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand one dollar and fifty cents per \xe2\x80\x9ctoken,\xe2\x80\x9d in _gold_. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinstructions\xe2\x80\x9d commanded that the Secretary regard a paper dollar issued\r\nby the government as equal to any other dollar issued by the government.\r\nHence the printing of the journals was discontinued. Then the United\r\nStates sternly rebuked the Secretary for disregarding the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinstructions,\xe2\x80\x9d and warned him to correct his ways. Wherefore he got\r\nsome printing done, forwarded the bill to Washington with full exhibits\r\nof the high prices of things in the Territory, and called attention to a\r\nprinted market report wherein it would be observed that even hay was two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars a ton. The United States responded by\r\nsubtracting the printing- bill from the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s suffering salary\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nmoreover remarked with dense gravity that he would find nothing in his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cinstructions\xe2\x80\x9d requiring him to purchase hay!\r\n\r\nNothing in this world is palled in such impenetrable obscurity as a U.S.\r\nTreasury Comptroller\xe2\x80\x99s understanding. The very fires of the hereafter\r\ncould get up nothing more than a fitful glimmer in it. In the days I\r\nspeak of he never could be made to comprehend why it was that twenty\r\nthousand dollars would not go as far in Nevada, where all commodities\r\nranged at an enormous figure, as it would in the other Territories,\r\nwhere exceeding cheapness was the rule. He was an officer who looked out\r\nfor the little expenses all the time. The Secretary of the Territory\r\nkept his office in his bedroom, as I before remarked; and he charged the\r\nUnited States no rent, although his \xe2\x80\x9cinstructions\xe2\x80\x9d provided for that\r\nitem and he could have justly taken advantage of it (a thing which I\r\nwould have done with more than lightning promptness if I had been\r\nSecretary myself). But the United States never applauded this devotion.\r\nIndeed, I think my country was ashamed to have so improvident a person\r\nin its employ.\r\n\r\nThose \xe2\x80\x9cinstructions\xe2\x80\x9d (we used to read a chapter from them every morning,\r\nas intellectual gymnastics, and a couple of chapters in Sunday school\r\nevery Sabbath, for they treated of all subjects under the sun and had\r\nmuch valuable religious matter in them along with the other statistics)\r\nthose \xe2\x80\x9cinstructions\xe2\x80\x9d commanded that pen-knives, envelopes, pens and\r\nwriting-paper be furnished the members of the legislature. So the\r\nSecretary made the purchase and the distribution. The knives cost three\r\ndollars apiece. There was one too many, and the Secretary gave it to the\r\nClerk of the House of Representatives. The United States said the Clerk\r\nof the House was not a \xe2\x80\x9cmember\xe2\x80\x9d of the legislature, and took that three\r\ndollars out of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s salary, as usual.\r\n\r\nWhite men charged three or four dollars a \xe2\x80\x9cload\xe2\x80\x9d for sawing up stove-\r\nwood. The Secretary was sagacious enough to know that the United States\r\nwould never pay any such price as that; so he got an Indian to saw up a\r\nload of office wood at one dollar and a half. He made out the usual\r\nvoucher, but signed no name to it\xe2\x80\x94simply appended a note explaining that\r\nan Indian had done the work, and had done it in a very capable and\r\nsatisfactory way, but could not sign the voucher owing to lack of\r\nability in the necessary direction. The Secretary had to pay that dollar\r\nand a half. He thought the United States would admire both his economy\r\nand his honesty in getting the work done at half price and not putting a\r\npretended Indian\xe2\x80\x99s signature to the voucher, but the United States did\r\nnot see it in that light.\r\n\r\nThe United States was too much accustomed to employing dollar-and-a-half\r\nthieves in all manner of official capacities to regard his explanation\r\nof the voucher as having any foundation in fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n190.jpg (22K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the next time the Indian sawed wood for us I taught him to make a\r\ncross at the bottom of the voucher\xe2\x80\x94it looked like a cross that had been\r\ndrunk a year\xe2\x80\x94and then I \xe2\x80\x9cwitnessed\xe2\x80\x9d it and it went through all right.\r\nThe United States never said a word. I was sorry I had not made the\r\nvoucher for a thousand loads of wood instead of one.\r\n\r\nThe government of my country snubs honest simplicity but fondles\r\nartistic villainy, and I think I might have developed into a very\r\ncapable pickpocket if I had remained in the public service a year or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThat was a fine collection of sovereigns, that first Nevada legislature.\r\nThey levied taxes to the amount of thirty or forty thousand dollars and\r\nordered expenditures to the extent of about a million. Yet they had\r\ntheir little periodical explosions of economy like all other bodies of\r\nthe kind. A member proposed to save three dollars a day to the nation by\r\ndispensing with the Chaplain. And yet that short-sighted man needed the\r\nChaplain more than any other member, perhaps, for he generally sat with\r\nhis feet on his desk, eating raw turnips, during the morning prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n191.jpg (99K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legislature sat sixty days, and passed private tollroad franchises\r\nall the time. When they adjourned it was estimated that every citizen\r\nowned about three franchises, and it was believed that unless Congress\r\ngave the Territory another degree of longitude there would not be room\r\nenough to accommodate the toll-roads. The ends of them were hanging over\r\nthe boundary line everywhere like a fringe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n192.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the freighting business had grown to such important\r\nproportions that there was nearly as much excitement over suddenly\r\nacquired toll-road fortunes as over the wonderful silver mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by I was smitten with the silver fever. \xe2\x80\x9cProspecting parties\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwere leaving for the mountains every day, and discovering and taking\r\npossession of rich silver-bearing lodes and ledges of quartz. Plainly\r\nthis was the road to fortune. The great \xe2\x80\x9cGould and Curry\xe2\x80\x9d mine was held\r\nat three or four hundred dollars a foot when we arrived; but in two\r\nmonths it had sprung up to eight hundred. The \xe2\x80\x9cOphir\xe2\x80\x9d had been worth\r\nonly a mere trifle, a year gone by, and now it was selling at nearly\r\n_four thousand dollars a foot_! Not a mine could be named that had not\r\nexperienced an astonishing advance in value within a short time.\r\nEverybody was talking about these marvels. Go where you would, you heard\r\nnothing else, from morning till far into the night. Tom So-and-So had\r\nsold out of the \xe2\x80\x9cAmanda Smith\xe2\x80\x9d for $40,000\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a cent when he \xe2\x80\x9ctook\r\nup\xe2\x80\x9d the ledge six months ago. John Jones had sold half his interest in\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBald Eagle and Mary Ann\xe2\x80\x9d for $65,000, gold coin, and gone to the\r\nStates for his family. The widow Brewster had \xe2\x80\x9cstruck it rich\xe2\x80\x9d in the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGolden Fleece\xe2\x80\x9d and sold ten feet for $18,000\xe2\x80\x94hadn\xe2\x80\x99t money enough to buy\r\na crape bonnet when Sing-Sing Tommy killed her husband at Baldy\r\nJohnson\xe2\x80\x99s wake last spring. The \xe2\x80\x9cLast Chance\xe2\x80\x9d had found a \xe2\x80\x9cclay casing\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand knew they were \xe2\x80\x9cright on the ledge\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94consequence, \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d that went\r\nbegging yesterday were worth a brick house apiece to-day, and seedy\r\nowners who could not get trusted for a drink at any bar in the country\r\nyesterday were roaring drunk on champagne to-day and had hosts of warm\r\npersonal friends in a town where they had forgotten how to bow or shake\r\nhands from long-continued want of practice. Johnny Morgan, a common\r\nloafer, had gone to sleep in the gutter and waked up worth a hundred\r\nthousand dollars, in consequence of the decision in the \xe2\x80\x9cLady Franklin\r\nand Rough and Ready\xe2\x80\x9d lawsuit. And so on\xe2\x80\x94day in and day out the talk\r\npelted our ears and the excitement waxed hotter and hotter around us.\r\n\r\nI would have been more or less than human if I had not gone mad like the\r\nrest. Cart-loads of solid silver bricks, as large as pigs of lead, were\r\narriving from the mills every day, and such sights as that gave\r\nsubstance to the wild talk about me. I succumbed and grew as frenzied as\r\nthe craziest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n194.jpg (65K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery few days news would come of the discovery of a bran-new mining\r\nregion; immediately the papers would teem with accounts of its richness,\r\nand away the surplus population would scamper to take possession. By the\r\ntime I was fairly inoculated with the disease, \xe2\x80\x9cEsmeralda\xe2\x80\x9d had just had\r\na run and \xe2\x80\x9cHumboldt\xe2\x80\x9d was beginning to shriek for attention. \xe2\x80\x9cHumboldt!\r\nHumboldt!\xe2\x80\x9d was the new cry, and straightway Humboldt, the newest of the\r\nnew, the richest of the rich, the most marvellous of the marvellous\r\ndiscoveries in silver-land was occupying two columns of the public\r\nprints to \xe2\x80\x9cEsmeralda\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d one. I was just on the point of starting to\r\nEsmeralda, but turned with the tide and got ready for Humboldt. That the\r\nreader may see what moved me, and what would as surely have moved him\r\nhad he been there, I insert here one of the newspaper letters of the\r\nday. It and several other letters from the same calm hand were the main\r\nmeans of converting me. I shall not garble the extract, but put it in\r\njust as it appeared in the _Daily Territorial Enterprise_:\r\n\r\nBut what about our mines? I shall be candid with you. I shall express an\r\nhonest opinion, based upon a thorough examination. Humboldt county is\r\nthe richest mineral region upon God\xe2\x80\x99s footstool. Each mountain range is\r\ngorged with the precious ores. Humboldt is the true Golconda.\r\n\r\nThe other day an assay of mere croppings yielded exceeding four thousand\r\ndollars to the ton. A week or two ago an assay of just such surface\r\ndevelopments made returns of seven thousand dollars to the ton. Our\r\nmountains are full of rambling prospectors. Each day and almost every\r\nhour reveals new and more startling evidences of the profuse and\r\nintensified wealth of our favored county. The metal is not silver alone.\r\nThere are distinct ledges of auriferous ore. A late discovery plainly\r\nevinces cinnabar. The coarser metals are in gross abundance. Lately\r\nevidences of bituminous coal have been detected. My theory has ever been\r\nthat coal is a ligneous formation. I told Col. Whitman, in times past,\r\nthat the neighborhood of Dayton (Nevada) betrayed no present or previous\r\nmanifestations of a ligneous foundation, and that hence I had no\r\nconfidence in his lauded coal mines. I repeated the same doctrine to the\r\nexultant coal discoverers of Humboldt. I talked with my friend Captain\r\nBurch on the subject. My pyrhanism vanished upon his statement that in\r\nthe very region referred to he had seen petrified trees of the length of\r\ntwo hundred feet. Then is the fact established that huge forests once\r\ncast their grim shadows over this remote section. I am firm in the coal\r\nfaith. Have no fears of the mineral resources of Humboldt county. They\r\nare immense\xe2\x80\x94incalculable.\r\n\r\nLet me state one or two things which will help the reader to better\r\ncomprehend certain items in the above. At this time, our near neighbor,\r\nGold Hill, was the most successful silver mining locality in Nevada. It\r\nwas from there that more than half the daily shipments of silver bricks\r\ncame. \xe2\x80\x9cVery rich\xe2\x80\x9d (and scarce) Gold Hill ore yielded from $100 to $400\r\nto the ton; but the usual yield was only $20 to $40 per ton\xe2\x80\x94that is to\r\nsay, each hundred pounds of ore yielded from one dollar to two dollars.\r\nBut the reader will perceive by the above extract, that in Humboldt from\r\none fourth to nearly half the mass was silver! That is to say, every one\r\nhundred pounds of the ore had from two hundred dollars up to about three\r\nhundred and fifty in it. Some days later this same correspondent wrote:\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the vast and almost fabulous wealth of this region\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nis incredible. The intestines of our mountains are gorged with precious\r\nore to plethora. I have said that nature has so shaped our mountains as\r\nto furnish most excellent facilities for the working of our mines. I\r\nhave also told you that the country about here is pregnant with the\r\nfinest mill sites in the world. But what is the mining history of\r\nHumboldt? The Sheba mine is in the hands of energetic San Francisco\r\ncapitalists. It would seem that the ore is combined with metals that\r\nrender it difficult of reduction with our imperfect mountain machinery.\r\nThe proprietors have combined the capital and labor hinted at in my\r\nexordium. They are toiling and probing. Their tunnel has reached the\r\nlength of one hundred feet. From primal assays alone, coupled with the\r\ndevelopment of the mine and public confidence in the continuance of\r\neffort, the stock had reared itself to eight hundred dollars market\r\nvalue. I do not know that one ton of the ore has been converted into\r\ncurrent metal. I do know that there are many lodes in this section that\r\nsurpass the Sheba in primal assay value. Listen a moment to the\r\ncalculations of the Sheba operators. They purpose transporting the ore\r\nconcentrated to Europe. The conveyance from Star City (its locality) to\r\nVirginia City will cost seventy dollars per ton; from Virginia to San\r\nFrancisco, forty dollars per ton; from thence to Liverpool, its\r\ndestination, ten dollars per ton. Their idea is that its conglomerate\r\nmetals will reimburse them their cost of original extraction, the price\r\nof transportation, and the expense of reduction, and that then a ton of\r\nthe raw ore will net them twelve hundred dollars. The estimate may be\r\nextravagant. Cut it in twain, and the product is enormous, far\r\ntranscending any previous developments of our racy Territory.\r\n\r\nA very common calculation is that many of our mines will yield five\r\nhundred dollars to the ton. Such fecundity throws the Gould & Curry, the\r\nOphir and the Mexican, of your neighborhood, in the darkest shadow. I\r\nhave given you the estimate of the value of a single developed mine. Its\r\nrichness is indexed by its market valuation. The people of Humboldt\r\ncounty are feet crazy. As I write, our towns are near deserted. They\r\nlook as languid as a consumptive girl. What has become of our sinewy and\r\nathletic fellow-citizens? They are coursing through ravines and over\r\nmountain tops. Their tracks are visible in every direction. Occasionally\r\na horseman will dash among us. His steed betrays hard usage. He alights\r\nbefore his adobe dwelling, hastily exchanges courtesies with his\r\ntownsmen, hurries to an assay office and from thence to the District\r\nRecorder\xe2\x80\x99s. In the morning, having renewed his provisional supplies, he\r\nis off again on his wild and unbeaten route. Why, the fellow numbers\r\nalready his feet by the thousands. He is the horse-leech. He has the\r\ncraving stomach of the shark or anaconda. He would conquer metallic\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n196.jpg (187K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was enough. The instant we had finished reading the above article,\r\nfour of us decided to go to Humboldt. We commenced getting ready at\r\nonce. And we also commenced upbraiding ourselves for not deciding\r\nsooner\xe2\x80\x94for we were in terror lest all the rich mines would be found and\r\nsecured before we got there, and we might have to put up with ledges\r\nthat would not yield more than two or three hundred dollars a ton,\r\nmaybe. An hour before, I would have felt opulent if I had owned ten feet\r\nin a Gold Hill mine whose ore produced twenty-five dollars to the ton;\r\nnow I was already annoyed at the prospect of having to put up with mines\r\nthe poorest of which would be a marvel in Gold Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHurry, was the word! We wasted no time. Our party consisted of four\r\npersons\xe2\x80\x94a blacksmith sixty years of age, two young lawyers, and myself.\r\nWe bought a wagon and two miserable old horses. We put eighteen hundred\r\npounds of provisions and mining tools in the wagon and drove out of\r\nCarson on a chilly December afternoon. The horses were so weak and old\r\nthat we soon found that it would be better if one or two of us got out\r\nand walked. It was an improvement. Next, we found that it would be\r\nbetter if a third man got out. That was an improvement also. It was at\r\nthis time that I volunteered to drive, although I had never driven a\r\nharnessed horse before and many a man in such a position would have felt\r\nfairly excused from such a responsibility. But in a little while it was\r\nfound that it would be a fine thing if the drive got out and walked\r\nalso. It was at this time that I resigned the position of driver, and\r\nnever resumed it again. Within the hour, we found that it would not only\r\nbe better, but was absolutely necessary, that we four, taking turns, two\r\nat a time, should put our hands against the end of the wagon and push it\r\nthrough the sand, leaving the feeble horses little to do but keep out of\r\nthe way and hold up the tongue. Perhaps it is well for one to know his\r\nfate at first, and get reconciled to it. We had learned ours in one\r\nafternoon. It was plain that we had to walk through the sand and shove\r\nthat wagon and those horses two hundred miles. So we accepted the\r\nsituation, and from that time forth we never rode. More than that, we\r\nstood regular and nearly constant watches pushing up behind.\r\n\r\nWe made seven miles, and camped in the desert. Young Clagett (now member\r\nof Congress from Montana) unharnessed and fed and watered the horses;\r\nOliphant and I cut sagebrush, built the fire and brought water to cook\r\nwith; and old Mr. Ballou the blacksmith did the cooking. This division\r\nof labor, and this appointment, was adhered to throughout the journey.\r\nWe had no tent, and so we slept under our blankets in the open plain. We\r\nwere so tired that we slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n199.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were fifteen days making the trip\xe2\x80\x94two hundred miles; thirteen,\r\nrather, for we lay by a couple of days, in one place, to let the horses\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nWe could really have accomplished the journey in ten days if we had\r\ntowed the horses behind the wagon, but we did not think of that until it\r\nwas too late, and so went on shoving the horses and the wagon too when\r\nwe might have saved half the labor. Parties who met us, occasionally,\r\nadvised us to put the _horses_ in the wagon, but Mr. Ballou, through\r\nwhose iron-clad earnestness no sarcasm could pierce, said that that\r\nwould not do, because the provisions were exposed and would suffer, the\r\nhorses being \xe2\x80\x9cbituminous from long deprivation.\xe2\x80\x9d The reader will excuse\r\nme from translating. What Mr. Ballou customarily meant, when he used a\r\nlong word, was a secret between himself and his Maker. He was one of the\r\nbest and kindest hearted men that ever graced a humble sphere of life.\r\nHe was gentleness and simplicity itself\xe2\x80\x94and unselfishness, too. Although\r\nhe was more than twice as old as the eldest of us, he never gave himself\r\nany airs, privileges, or exemptions on that account. He did a _young_\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s share of the work; and did his share of conversing and\r\nentertaining from the general stand-point of any age\xe2\x80\x94not from the\r\narrogant, overawing summit-height of sixty years. His one striking\r\npeculiarity was his Partingtonian fashion of loving and using big words\r\n_for their own sakes_, and independent of any bearing they might have\r\nupon the thought he was purposing to convey. He always let his ponderous\r\nsyllables fall with an easy unconsciousness that left them wholly\r\nwithout offensiveness. In truth his air was so natural and so simple\r\nthat one was always catching himself accepting his stately sentences as\r\nmeaning something, when they really meant nothing in the world. If a\r\nword was long and grand and resonant, that was sufficient to win the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s love, and he would drop that word into the most out-of-the-way\r\nplace in a sentence or a subject, and be as pleased with it as if it\r\nwere perfectly luminous with meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n201.jpg (62K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe four always spread our common stock of blankets together on the\r\nfrozen ground, and slept side by side; and finding that our foolish,\r\nlong-legged hound pup had a deal of animal heat in him, Oliphant got to\r\nadmitting him to the bed, between himself and Mr. Ballou, hugging the\r\ndog\xe2\x80\x99s warm back to his breast and finding great comfort in it. But in\r\nthe night the pup would get stretchy and brace his feet against the old\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s back and shove, grunting complacently the while; and now and then,\r\nbeing warm and snug, grateful and happy, he would paw the old man\xe2\x80\x99s back\r\nsimply in excess of comfort; and at yet other times he would dream of\r\nthe chase and in his sleep tug at the old man\xe2\x80\x99s back hair and bark in\r\nhis ear. The old gentleman complained mildly about these familiarities,\r\nat last, and when he got through with his statement he said that such a\r\ndog as that was not a proper animal to admit to bed with tired men,\r\nbecause he was \xe2\x80\x9cso meretricious in his movements and so organic in his\r\nemotions.\xe2\x80\x9d We turned the dog out.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard, wearing, toilsome journey, but it had its bright side;\r\nfor after each day was done and our wolfish hunger appeased with a hot\r\nsupper of fried bacon, bread, molasses and black coffee, the pipe-\r\nsmoking, song- singing and yarn-spinning around the evening camp-fire in\r\nthe still solitudes of the desert was a happy, care-free sort of\r\nrecreation that seemed the very summit and culmination of earthly\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nIt is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men, whether city\r\nor country-bred. We are descended from desert-lounging Arabs, and\r\ncountless ages of growth toward perfect civilization have failed to root\r\nout of us the nomadic instinct. We all confess to a gratified thrill at\r\nthe thought of \xe2\x80\x9ccamping out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce we made twenty-five miles in a day, and once we made forty miles\r\n(through the Great American Desert), and ten miles beyond\xe2\x80\x94fifty in\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94in twenty-three hours, without halting to eat, drink or rest. To\r\nstretch out and go to sleep, even on stony and frozen ground, after\r\npushing a wagon and two horses fifty miles, is a delight so supreme that\r\nfor the moment it almost seems cheap at the price.\r\n\r\nWe camped two days in the neighborhood of the \xe2\x80\x9cSink of the Humboldt.\xe2\x80\x9d We\r\ntried to use the strong alkaline water of the Sink, but it would not\r\nanswer. It was like drinking lye, and not weak lye, either. It left a\r\ntaste in the mouth, bitter and every way execrable, and a burning in the\r\nstomach that was very uncomfortable. We put molasses in it, but that\r\nhelped it very little; we added a pickle, yet the alkali was the\r\nprominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n202.jpg (58K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coffee we made of this water was the meanest compound man has yet\r\ninvented. It was really viler to the taste than the unameliorated water\r\nitself. Mr. Ballou, being the architect and builder of the beverage felt\r\nconstrained to endorse and uphold it, and so drank half a cup, by little\r\nsips, making shift to praise it faintly the while, but finally threw out\r\nthe remainder, and said frankly it was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo technical for _him_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut presently we found a spring of fresh water, convenient, and then,\r\nwith nothing to mar our enjoyment, and no stragglers to interrupt it, we\r\nentered into our rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Sink, we traveled along the Humboldt river a little\r\nway. People accustomed to the monster mile-wide Mississippi, grow\r\naccustomed to associating the term \xe2\x80\x9criver\xe2\x80\x9d with a high degree of watery\r\ngrandeur. Consequently, such people feel rather disappointed when they\r\nstand on the shores of the Humboldt or the Carson and find that a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9criver\xe2\x80\x9d in Nevada is a sickly rivulet which is just the counterpart of\r\nthe Erie canal in all respects save that the canal is twice as long and\r\nfour times as deep. One of the pleasantest and most invigorating\r\nexercises one can contrive is to run and jump across the Humboldt river\r\ntill he is overheated, and then drink it dry.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth day we completed our march of two hundred miles and\r\nentered Unionville, Humboldt county, in the midst of a driving snow-\r\nstorm. Unionville consisted of eleven cabins and a liberty-pole. Six of\r\nthe cabins were strung along one side of a deep canyon, and the other\r\nfive faced them. The rest of the landscape was made up of bleak mountain\r\nwalls that rose so high into the sky from both sides of the canyon that\r\nthe village was left, as it were, far down in the bottom of a crevice.\r\nIt was always daylight on the mountain tops a long time before the\r\ndarkness lifted and revealed Unionville.\r\n\r\nWe built a small, rude cabin in the side of the crevice and roofed it\r\nwith canvas, leaving a corner open to serve as a chimney, through which\r\nthe cattle used to tumble occasionally, at night, and mash our furniture\r\nand interrupt our sleep. It was very cold weather and fuel was scarce.\r\nIndians brought brush and bushes several miles on their backs; and when\r\nwe could catch a laden Indian it was well\xe2\x80\x94and when we could not (which\r\nwas the rule, not the exception), we shivered and bore it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n205.jpg (58K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI confess, without shame, that I expected to find masses of silver lying\r\nall about the ground. I expected to see it glittering in the sun on the\r\nmountain summits. I said nothing about this, for some instinct told me\r\nthat I might possibly have an exaggerated idea about it, and so if I\r\nbetrayed my thought I might bring derision upon myself. Yet I was as\r\nperfectly satisfied in my own mind as I could be of anything, that I was\r\ngoing to gather up, in a day or two, or at furthest a week or two,\r\nsilver enough to make me satisfactorily wealthy\xe2\x80\x94and so my fancy was\r\nalready busy with plans for spending this money. The first opportunity\r\nthat offered, I sauntered carelessly away from the cabin, keeping an eye\r\non the other boys, and stopping and contemplating the sky when they\r\nseemed to be observing me; but as soon as the coast was manifestly\r\nclear, I fled away as guiltily as a thief might have done and never\r\nhalted till I was far beyond sight and call. Then I began my search with\r\na feverish excitement that was brimful of expectation\xe2\x80\x94almost of\r\ncertainty. I crawled about the ground, seizing and examining bits of\r\nstone, blowing the dust from them or rubbing them on my clothes, and\r\nthen peering at them with anxious hope. Presently I found a bright\r\nfragment and my heart bounded! I hid behind a boulder and polished it\r\nand scrutinized it with a nervous eagerness and a delight that was more\r\npronounced than absolute certainty itself could have afforded. The more\r\nI examined the fragment the more I was convinced that I had found the\r\ndoor to fortune. I marked the spot and carried away my specimen. Up and\r\ndown the rugged mountain side I searched, with always increasing\r\ninterest and always augmenting gratitude that I had come to Humboldt and\r\ncome in time. Of all the experiences of my life, this secret search\r\namong the hidden treasures of silver-land was the nearest to unmarred\r\necstasy. It was a delirious revel.\r\n\r\nBy and by, in the bed of a shallow rivulet, I found a deposit of shining\r\nyellow scales, and my breath almost forsook me! A gold mine, and in my\r\nsimplicity I had been content with vulgar silver! I was so excited that\r\nI half believed my overwrought imagination was deceiving me. Then a fear\r\ncame upon me that people might be observing me and would guess my\r\nsecret. Moved by this thought, I made a circuit of the place, and\r\nascended a knoll to reconnoiter. Solitude. No creature was near. Then I\r\nreturned to my mine, fortifying myself against possible disappointment,\r\nbut my fears were groundless\xe2\x80\x94the shining scales were still there. I set\r\nabout scooping them out, and for an hour I toiled down the windings of\r\nthe stream and robbed its bed. But at last the descending sun warned me\r\nto give up the quest, and I turned homeward laden with wealth. As I\r\nwalked along I could not help smiling at the thought of my being so\r\nexcited over my fragment of silver when a nobler metal was almost under\r\nmy nose. In this little time the former had so fallen in my estimation\r\nthat once or twice I was on the point of throwing it away.\r\n\r\nThe boys were as hungry as usual, but I could eat nothing. Neither could\r\nI talk. I was full of dreams and far away. Their conversation\r\ninterrupted the flow of my fancy somewhat, and annoyed me a little, too.\r\nI despised the sordid and commonplace things they talked about. But as\r\nthey proceeded, it began to amuse me. It grew to be rare fun to hear\r\nthem planning their poor little economies and sighing over possible\r\nprivations and distresses when a gold mine, all our own, lay within\r\nsight of the cabin and I could point it out at any moment. Smothered\r\nhilarity began to oppress me, presently. It was hard to resist the\r\nimpulse to burst out with exultation and reveal everything; but I did\r\nresist. I said within myself that I would filter the great news through\r\nmy lips calmly and be serene as a summer morning while I watched its\r\neffect in their faces. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you all been?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProspecting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you find?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing? What do you think of the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t tell, yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ballou, who was an old gold miner, and had\r\nlikewise had considerable experience among the silver mines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you formed any sort of opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a sort of a one. It\xe2\x80\x99s fair enough here, may be, but overrated.\r\nSeven thousand dollar ledges are scarce, though.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Sheba may be rich enough, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t own it; and besides, the\r\nrock is so full of base metals that all the science in the world can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwork it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll not starve, here, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll not get rich, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think the prospect is pretty poor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo name for it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99d better go back, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, not yet\xe2\x80\x94of course not. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try it a riffle, first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, now\xe2\x80\x94this is merely a supposition, you know\xe2\x80\x94suppose you could\r\nfind a ledge that would yield, say, a hundred and fifty dollars a\r\nton\xe2\x80\x94would _that_ satisfy you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry us once!\xe2\x80\x9d from the whole party.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr suppose\xe2\x80\x94merely a supposition, of course\xe2\x80\x94suppose you were to find a\r\nledge that would yield two thousand dollars a ton\xe2\x80\x94would that satisfy\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x94what do you mean? What are you coming at? Is there some mystery\r\nbehind all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind. I am not saying anything. You know perfectly well there are\r\nno rich mines here\xe2\x80\x94of course you do. Because you have been around and\r\nexamined for yourselves. Anybody would know that, that had been around.\r\nBut just for the sake of argument, suppose\xe2\x80\x94in a kind of general\r\nway\xe2\x80\x94suppose some person were to tell you that two-thousand-dollar ledges\r\nwere simply contemptible\xe2\x80\x94contemptible, understand\xe2\x80\x94and that right yonder\r\nin sight of this very cabin there were piles of pure gold and pure\r\nsilver\xe2\x80\x94oceans of it\xe2\x80\x94enough to make you all rich in twenty-four hours!\r\nCome!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should say he was as crazy as a loon!\xe2\x80\x9d said old Ballou, but wild with\r\nexcitement, nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say anything\xe2\x80\x94_I_ haven\xe2\x80\x99t been around, you\r\nknow, and of course don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything\xe2\x80\x94but all I ask of you is to cast\r\nyour eye on _that_, for instance, and tell me what you think of it!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nI tossed my treasure before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n207.jpg (92K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an eager scramble for it, and a closing of heads together over\r\nit under the candle-light. Then old Ballou said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThink of it? I think it is nothing but a lot of granite rubbish and\r\nnasty glittering mica that isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth ten cents an acre!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo vanished my dream. So melted my wealth away. So toppled my airy\r\ncastle to the earth and left me stricken and forlorn.\r\n\r\nMoralizing, I observed, then, that \xe2\x80\x9call that glitters is not gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Ballou said I could go further than that, and lay it up among my\r\ntreasures of knowledge, that _nothing_ that glitters is gold. So I\r\nlearned then, once for all, that gold in its native state is but dull,\r\nunornamental stuff, and that only low-born metals excite the admiration\r\nof the ignorant with an ostentatious glitter. However, like the rest of\r\nthe world, I still go on underrating men of gold and glorifying men of\r\nmica. Commonplace human nature cannot rise above that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue knowledge of the nature of silver mining came fast enough. We went\r\nout \xe2\x80\x9cprospecting\xe2\x80\x9d with Mr. Ballou. We climbed the mountain sides, and\r\nclambered among sage-brush, rocks and snow till we were ready to drop\r\nwith exhaustion, but found no silver\xe2\x80\x94nor yet any gold. Day after day we\r\ndid this. Now and then we came upon holes burrowed a few feet into the\r\ndeclivities and apparently abandoned; and now and then we found one or\r\ntwo listless men still burrowing. But there was no appearance of silver.\r\nThese holes were the beginnings of tunnels, and the purpose was to drive\r\nthem hundreds of feet into the mountain, and some day tap the hidden\r\nledge where the silver was. Some day! It seemed far enough away, and\r\nvery hopeless and dreary. Day after day we toiled, and climbed and\r\nsearched, and we younger partners grew sicker and still sicker of the\r\npromiseless toil. At last we halted under a beetling rampart of rock\r\nwhich projected from the earth high upon the mountain. Mr. Ballou broke\r\noff some fragments with a hammer, and examined them long and attentively\r\nwith a small eye-glass; threw them away and broke off more; said this\r\nrock was quartz, and quartz was the sort of rock that contained silver.\r\n_Contained_ it! I had thought that at least it would be caked on the\r\noutside of it like a kind of veneering. He still broke off pieces and\r\ncritically examined them, now and then wetting the piece with his tongue\r\nand applying the glass. At last he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n210.jpg (74K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were full of anxiety in a moment. The rock was clean and white, where\r\nit was broken, and across it ran a ragged thread of blue. He said that\r\nthat little thread had silver in it, mixed with base metal, such as lead\r\nand antimony, and other rubbish, and that there was a speck or two of\r\ngold visible. After a great deal of effort we managed to discern some\r\nlittle fine yellow specks, and judged that a couple of tons of them\r\nmassed together might make a gold dollar, possibly. We were not\r\njubilant, but Mr. Ballou said there were worse ledges in the world than\r\nthat. He saved what he called the \xe2\x80\x9crichest\xe2\x80\x9d piece of the rock, in order\r\nto determine its value by the process called the \xe2\x80\x9cfire-assay.\xe2\x80\x9d Then we\r\nnamed the mine \xe2\x80\x9cMonarch of the Mountains\xe2\x80\x9d (modesty of nomenclature is\r\nnot a prominent feature in the mines), and Mr. Ballou wrote out and\r\nstuck up the following \xe2\x80\x9cnotice,\xe2\x80\x9d preserving a copy to be entered upon\r\nthe books in the mining recorder\xe2\x80\x99s office in the town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNOTICE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe the undersigned claim three claims, of three hundred feet each (and\r\none for discovery), on this silver-bearing quartz lead or lode,\r\nextending north and south from this notice, with all its dips, spurs,\r\nand angles, variations and sinuosities, together with fifty feet of\r\nground on either side for working the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe put our names to it and tried to feel that our fortunes were made.\r\nBut when we talked the matter all over with Mr. Ballou, we felt\r\ndepressed and dubious. He said that this surface quartz was not all\r\nthere was of our mine; but that the wall or ledge of rock called the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMonarch of the Mountains,\xe2\x80\x9d extended down hundreds and hundreds of feet\r\ninto the earth\xe2\x80\x94he illustrated by saying it was like a curb-stone, and\r\nmaintained a nearly uniform thickness\xe2\x80\x94say twenty feet\xe2\x80\x94away down into the\r\nbowels of the earth, and was perfectly distinct from the casing rock on\r\neach side of it; and that it kept to itself, and maintained its\r\ndistinctive character always, no matter how deep it extended into the\r\nearth or how far it stretched itself through and across the hills and\r\nvalleys. He said it might be a mile deep and ten miles long, for all we\r\nknew; and that wherever we bored into it above ground or below, we would\r\nfind gold and silver in it, but no gold or silver in the meaner rock it\r\nwas cased between. And he said that down in the great depths of the\r\nledge was its richness, and the deeper it went the richer it grew.\r\nTherefore, instead of working here on the surface, we must either bore\r\ndown into the rock with a shaft till we came to where it was rich\xe2\x80\x94say a\r\nhundred feet or so\xe2\x80\x94or else we must go down into the valley and bore a\r\nlong tunnel into the mountain side and tap the ledge far under the\r\nearth. To do either was plainly the labor of months; for we could blast\r\nand bore only a few feet a day\xe2\x80\x94some five or six. But this was not all.\r\nHe said that after we got the ore out it must be hauled in wagons to a\r\ndistant silver-mill, ground up, and the silver extracted by a tedious\r\nand costly process. Our fortune seemed a century away!\r\n\r\nBut we went to work. We decided to sink a shaft. So, for a week we\r\nclimbed the mountain, laden with picks, drills, gads, crowbars, shovels,\r\ncans of blasting powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and\r\nmain. At first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks\r\nand threw it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well. But\r\nthe rock became more compact, presently, and gads and crowbars came into\r\nplay. But shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder.\r\n\r\nThat was the weariest work! One of us held the iron drill in its place\r\nand another would strike with an eight-pound sledge\xe2\x80\x94it was like driving\r\nnails on a large scale. In the course of an hour or two the drill would\r\nreach a depth of two or three feet, making a hole a couple of inches in\r\ndiameter. We would put in a charge of powder, insert half a yard of\r\nfuse, pour in sand and gravel and ram it down, then light the fuse and\r\nrun. When the explosion came and the rocks and smoke shot into the air,\r\nwe would go back and find about a bushel of that hard, rebellious quartz\r\njolted out. Nothing more. One week of this satisfied me. I resigned.\r\nClagget and Oliphant followed. Our shaft was only twelve feet deep. We\r\ndecided that a tunnel was the thing we wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n212.jpg (89K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we went down the mountain side and worked a week; at the end of which\r\ntime we had blasted a tunnel about deep enough to hide a hogshead in,\r\nand judged that about nine hundred feet more of it would reach the\r\nledge. I resigned again, and the other boys only held out one day\r\nlonger. We decided that a tunnel was not what we wanted. We wanted a\r\nledge that was already \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloped.\xe2\x80\x9d There were none in the camp.\r\n\r\nWe dropped the \xe2\x80\x9cMonarch\xe2\x80\x9d for the time being.\r\n\r\nMeantime the camp was filling up with people, and there was a constantly\r\ngrowing excitement about our Humboldt mines. We fell victims to the\r\nepidemic and strained every nerve to acquire more \xe2\x80\x9cfeet.\xe2\x80\x9d We prospected\r\nand took up new claims, put \xe2\x80\x9cnotices\xe2\x80\x9d on them and gave them\r\ngrandiloquent names. We traded some of our \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d in other\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s claims. In a little while we owned largely in the \xe2\x80\x9cGray Eagle,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cColumbiana,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cBranch Mint,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cMaria Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cUniverse,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cRoot-Hog-or-Die,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cSamson and Delilah,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cTreasure Trove,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cGolconda,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cSultana,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cBoomerang,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Republic,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cGrand Mogul,\xe2\x80\x9d and fifty other \xe2\x80\x9cmines\xe2\x80\x9d that had never been molested\r\nby a shovel or scratched with a pick. We had not less than thirty\r\nthousand \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d apiece in the \xe2\x80\x9crichest mines on earth\xe2\x80\x9d as the frenzied\r\ncant phrased it\xe2\x80\x94and were in debt to the butcher. We were stark mad with\r\nexcitement\xe2\x80\x94drunk with happiness\xe2\x80\x94smothered under mountains of prospective\r\nwealth\xe2\x80\x94arrogantly compassionate toward the plodding millions who knew\r\nnot our marvellous canyon\xe2\x80\x94but our credit was not good at the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nIt was the strangest phase of life one can imagine. It was a beggars\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrevel. There was nothing doing in the district\xe2\x80\x94no mining\xe2\x80\x94no milling\xe2\x80\x94no\r\nproductive effort\xe2\x80\x94no income\xe2\x80\x94and not enough money in the entire camp to\r\nbuy a corner lot in an eastern village, hardly; and yet a stranger would\r\nhave supposed he was walking among bloated millionaires. Prospecting\r\nparties swarmed out of town with the first flush of dawn, and swarmed in\r\nagain at nightfall laden with spoil\xe2\x80\x94rocks. Nothing but rocks. Every\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s pockets were full of them; the floor of his cabin was littered\r\nwith them; they were disposed in labeled rows on his shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n214.jpg (51K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI met men at every turn who owned from one thousand to thirty thousand\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d in undeveloped silver mines, every single foot of which they\r\nbelieved would shortly be worth from fifty to a thousand dollars\xe2\x80\x94and as\r\noften as any other way they were men who had not twenty-five dollars in\r\nthe world. Every man you met had his new mine to boast of, and his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cspecimens\xe2\x80\x9d ready; and if the opportunity offered, he would infallibly\r\nback you into a corner and offer as a favor to you, not to him, to part\r\nwith just a few feet in the \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Age,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cSarah Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d or some\r\nother unknown stack of croppings, for money enough to get a \xe2\x80\x9csquare\r\nmeal\xe2\x80\x9d with, as the phrase went. And you were never to reveal that he had\r\nmade you the offer at such a ruinous price, for it was only out of\r\nfriendship for you that he was willing to make the sacrifice. Then he\r\nwould fish a piece of rock out of his pocket, and after looking\r\nmysteriously around as if he feared he might be waylaid and robbed if\r\ncaught with such wealth in his possession, he would dab the rock against\r\nhis tongue, clap an eyeglass to it, and exclaim:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at that! Right there in that red dirt! See it? See the specks of\r\ngold? And the streak of silver? That\xe2\x80\x99s from the \xe2\x80\x98Uncle Abe.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nhundred thousand tons like that in sight! Right in sight, mind you! And\r\nwhen we get down on it and the ledge comes in solid, it will be the\r\nrichest thing in the world! Look at the assay! I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to\r\nbelieve _me_\xe2\x80\x94look at the assay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n216.jpg (63K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he would get out a greasy sheet of paper which showed that the\r\nportion of rock assayed had given evidence of containing silver and gold\r\nin the proportion of so many hundreds or thousands of dollars to the\r\nton.\r\n\r\nI little knew, then, that the custom was to hunt out the _richest_ piece\r\nof rock and get it assayed! Very often, that piece, the size of a\r\nfilbert, was the only fragment in a ton that had a particle of metal in\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94and yet the assay made it pretend to represent the average value of\r\nthe ton of rubbish it came from!\r\n\r\nOn such a system of assaying as that, the Humboldt world had gone crazy.\r\nOn the authority of such assays its newspaper correspondents were\r\nfrothing about rock worth four and seven thousand dollars a ton!\r\n\r\nAnd does the reader remember, a few pages back, the calculations, of a\r\nquoted correspondent, whereby the ore is to be mined and shipped all the\r\nway to England, the metals extracted, and the gold and silver contents\r\nreceived back by the miners as clear profit, the copper, antimony and\r\nother things in the ore being sufficient to pay all the expenses\r\nincurred? Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s head was full of such \xe2\x80\x9ccalculations\xe2\x80\x9d as those\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nraving insanity, rather. Few people took _work_ into their\r\ncalculations\xe2\x80\x94or outlay of money either; except the work and expenditures\r\nof other people.\r\n\r\nWe never touched our tunnel or our shaft again. Why? Because we judged\r\nthat we had learned the _real_ secret of success in silver mining\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nwas, _not_ to mine the silver ourselves by the sweat of our brows and\r\nthe labor of our hands, but to _sell_ the ledges to the dull slaves of\r\ntoil and let them do the mining!\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Carson, the Secretary and I had purchased \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d from\r\nvarious Esmeralda stragglers. We had expected immediate returns of\r\nbullion, but were only afflicted with regular and constant \xe2\x80\x9cassessments\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ninstead\xe2\x80\x94demands for money wherewith to develop the said mines. These\r\nassessments had grown so oppressive that it seemed necessary to look\r\ninto the matter personally. Therefore I projected a pilgrimage to Carson\r\nand thence to Esmeralda. I bought a horse and started, in company with\r\nMr. Ballou and a gentleman named Ollendorff, a Prussian\xe2\x80\x94not the party\r\nwho has inflicted so much suffering on the world with his wretched\r\nforeign grammars, with their interminable repetitions of questions which\r\nnever have occurred and are never likely to occur in any conversation\r\namong human beings. We rode through a snow-storm for two or three days,\r\nand arrived at \xe2\x80\x9cHoney Lake Smith\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d a sort of isolated inn on the\r\nCarson river. It was a two-story log house situated on a small knoll in\r\nthe midst of the vast basin or desert through which the sickly Carson\r\nwinds its melancholy way. Close to the house were the Overland stage\r\nstables, built of sun-dried bricks. There was not another building\r\nwithin several leagues of the place. Towards sunset about twenty hay-\r\nwagons arrived and camped around the house and all the teamsters came in\r\nto supper\xe2\x80\x94a very, very rough set. There were one or two Overland stage\r\ndrivers there, also, and half a dozen vagabonds and stragglers;\r\nconsequently the house was well crowded.\r\n\r\nWe walked out, after supper, and visited a small Indian camp in the\r\nvicinity. The Indians were in a great hurry about something, and were\r\npacking up and getting away as fast as they could. In their broken\r\nEnglish they said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy\xe2\x80\x99m-by, heap water!\xe2\x80\x9d and by the help of signs made\r\nus understand that in their opinion a flood was coming. The weather was\r\nperfectly clear, and this was not the rainy season. There was about a\r\nfoot of water in the insignificant river\xe2\x80\x94or maybe two feet; the stream\r\nwas not wider than a back alley in a village, and its banks were\r\nscarcely higher than a man\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\n\r\nSo, where was the flood to come from? We canvassed the subject awhile\r\nand then concluded it was a ruse, and that the Indians had some better\r\nreason for leaving in a hurry than fears of a flood in such an\r\nexceedingly dry time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n218.jpg (37K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening we went to bed in the second story\xe2\x80\x94with our\r\nclothes on, as usual, and all three in the same bed, for every available\r\nspace on the floors, chairs, etc., was in request, and even then there\r\nwas barely room for the housing of the inn\xe2\x80\x99s guests. An hour later we\r\nwere awakened by a great turmoil, and springing out of bed we picked our\r\nway nimbly among the ranks of snoring teamsters on the floor and got to\r\nthe front windows of the long room. A glance revealed a strange\r\nspectacle, under the moonlight. The crooked Carson was full to the brim,\r\nand its waters were raging and foaming in the wildest way\xe2\x80\x94sweeping\r\naround the sharp bends at a furious speed, and bearing on their surface\r\na chaos of logs, brush and all sorts of rubbish. A depression, where its\r\nbed had once been, in other times, was already filling, and in one or\r\ntwo places the water was beginning to wash over the main bank. Men were\r\nflying hither and thither, bringing cattle and wagons close up to the\r\nhouse, for the spot of high ground on which it stood extended only some\r\nthirty feet in front and about a hundred in the rear. Close to the old\r\nriver bed just spoken of, stood a little log stable, and in this our\r\nhorses were lodged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n219.jpg (173K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we looked, the waters increased so fast in this place that in a\r\nfew minutes a torrent was roaring by the little stable and its margin\r\nencroaching steadily on the logs. We suddenly realized that this flood\r\nwas not a mere holiday spectacle, but meant damage\xe2\x80\x94and not only to the\r\nsmall log stable but to the Overland buildings close to the main river,\r\nfor the waves had now come ashore and were creeping about the\r\nfoundations and invading the great hay-corral adjoining. We ran down and\r\njoined the crowd of excited men and frightened animals. We waded knee-\r\ndeep into the log stable, unfastened the horses and waded out almost\r\n_waist_-deep, so fast the waters increased. Then the crowd rushed in a\r\nbody to the hay-corral and began to tumble down the huge stacks of baled\r\nhay and roll the bales up on the high ground by the house. Meantime it\r\nwas discovered that Owens, an overland driver, was missing, and a man\r\nran to the large stable, and wading in, boot-top deep, discovered him\r\nasleep in his bed, awoke him, and waded out again. But Owens was drowsy\r\nand resumed his nap; but only for a minute or two, for presently he\r\nturned in his bed, his hand dropped over the side and came in contact\r\nwith the cold water! It was up level with the mattress! He waded out,\r\nbreast-deep, almost, and the next moment the sun-burned bricks melted\r\ndown like sugar and the big building crumbled to a ruin and was washed\r\naway in a twinkling.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock only the roof of the little log stable was out of\r\nwater, and our inn was on an island in mid-ocean. As far as the eye\r\ncould reach, in the moonlight, there was no desert visible, but only a\r\nlevel waste of shining water. The Indians were true prophets, but how\r\ndid they get their information? I am not able to answer the question. We\r\nremained cooped up eight days and nights with that curious crew.\r\nSwearing, drinking and card playing were the order of the day, and\r\noccasionally a fight was thrown in for variety. Dirt and vermin\xe2\x80\x94but let\r\nus forget those features; their profusion is simply inconceivable\xe2\x80\x94it is\r\nbetter that they remain so.\r\n\r\nThere were two men\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94however, this chapter is long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two men in the company who caused me particular discomfort.\r\nOne was a little Swede, about twenty-five years old, who knew only one\r\nsong, and he was forever singing it. By day we were all crowded into one\r\nsmall, stifling bar-room, and so there was no escaping this person\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmusic. Through all the profanity, whisky-guzzling, \xe2\x80\x9cold sledge\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nquarreling, his monotonous song meandered with never a variation in its\r\ntiresome sameness, and it seemed to me, at last, that I would be content\r\nto die, in order to be rid of the torture. The other man was a stalwart\r\nruffian called \xe2\x80\x9cArkansas,\xe2\x80\x9d who carried two revolvers in his belt and a\r\nbowie knife projecting from his boot, and who was always drunk and\r\nalways suffering for a fight. But he was so feared, that nobody would\r\naccommodate him. He would try all manner of little wary ruses to entrap\r\nsomebody into an offensive remark, and his face would light up now and\r\nthen when he fancied he was fairly on the scent of a fight, but\r\ninvariably his victim would elude his toils and then he would show a\r\ndisappointment that was almost pathetic. The landlord, Johnson, was a\r\nmeek, well-meaning fellow, and Arkansas fastened on him early, as a\r\npromising subject, and gave him no rest day or night, for awhile. On the\r\nfourth morning, Arkansas got drunk and sat himself down to wait for an\r\nopportunity. Presently Johnson came in, just comfortably sociable with\r\nwhisky, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon the Pennsylvania \xe2\x80\x99lection\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nArkansas raised his finger impressively and Johnson stopped. Arkansas\r\nrose unsteadily and confronted him. Said he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWh\xe2\x80\x94what do you know a\xe2\x80\x94about Pennsylvania? Answer me that. Wha\xe2\x80\x94what do\r\nyou know \xe2\x80\x99bout Pennsylvania?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was only goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was only goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say. You was! You was only goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say\xe2\x80\x94what was\r\nyou goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say? That\xe2\x80\x99s it! That\xe2\x80\x99s what _I_ want to know. I want to\r\nknow wha-what you (\xe2\x80\x99_ic_) what you know about Pennsylvania, since you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nmakin\xe2\x80\x99 yourself so d\xe2\x80\x94-d free. Answer me that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Arkansas, if you\xe2\x80\x99d only let me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n222.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s a henderin\xe2\x80\x99 you? Don\xe2\x80\x99t you insinuate nothing agin me!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\ndo it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you come in here bullyin\xe2\x80\x99 around, and cussin\xe2\x80\x99 and goin\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nlike a lunatic\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you do it. \xe2\x80\x99Coz _I_ won\xe2\x80\x99t stand it. If fight\xe2\x80\x99s what\r\nyou want, out with it! I\xe2\x80\x99m your man! Out with it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaid Johnson, backing into a corner, Arkansas following, menacingly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, _I_ never said nothing, Mr. Arkansas. You don\xe2\x80\x99t give a man no\r\nchance. I was only goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say that Pennsylvania was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to have an\r\nelection next week\xe2\x80\x94that was all\xe2\x80\x94that was everything I was goin\xe2\x80\x99 to say\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nwish I may never stir if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then why d\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99t you say it? What did you come swellin\xe2\x80\x99 around that\r\nway for, and tryin\xe2\x80\x99 to raise trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy I didn\xe2\x80\x99t come swellin\xe2\x80\x99 around, Mr. Arkansas\xe2\x80\x94I just\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a liar am I! Ger-reat Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s ghost\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, please, Mr. Arkansas, I never meant such a thing as that, I wish I\r\nmay die if I did. All the boys will tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99ve always spoke well\r\nof you, and respected you more\xe2\x80\x99n any man in the house. Ask Smith. Ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit so, Smith? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say, no longer ago than last night, that for a\r\nman that was a gentleman _all_ the time and every way you took him, give\r\nme Arkansas? I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to any gentleman here if them warn\xe2\x80\x99t the very\r\nwords I used. Come, now, Mr. Arkansas, le\xe2\x80\x99s take a drink\xe2\x80\x94le\xe2\x80\x99s shake\r\nhands and take a drink. Come up\xe2\x80\x94everybody! It\xe2\x80\x99s my treat. Come up, Bill,\r\nTom, Bob, Scotty\xe2\x80\x94come up. I want you all to take a drink with me and\r\nArkansas\xe2\x80\x94_old_ Arkansas, I call him\xe2\x80\x94bully old Arkansas. Gimme your hand\r\nagin. Look at him, boys\xe2\x80\x94just take a _look_ at him. Thar stands the\r\nwhitest man in America!\xe2\x80\x94and the man that denies it has got to fight\r\n_me_, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Gimme that old flipper agin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey embraced, with drunken affection on the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s part and\r\nunresponsive toleration on the part of Arkansas, who, bribed by a drink,\r\nwas disappointed of his prey once more. But the foolish landlord was so\r\nhappy to have escaped butchery, that he went on talking when he ought to\r\nhave marched himself out of danger. The consequence was that Arkansas\r\nshortly began to glower upon him dangerously, and presently said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLan\xe2\x80\x99lord, will you p-please make that remark over agin if you please?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a-sayin\xe2\x80\x99 to Scotty that my father was up\xe2\x80\x99ards of eighty year old\r\nwhen he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that _all_ that you said?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t say nothing but that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen an uncomfortable silence.\r\n\r\nArkansas played with his glass a moment, lolling on his elbows on the\r\ncounter. Then he meditatively scratched his left shin with his right\r\nboot, while the awkward silence continued. But presently he loafed away\r\ntoward the stove, looking dissatisfied; roughly shouldered two or three\r\nmen out of a comfortable position; occupied it himself, gave a sleeping\r\ndog a kick that sent him howling under a bench, then spread his long\r\nlegs and his blanket-coat tails apart and proceeded to warm his back. In\r\na little while he fell to grumbling to himself, and soon he slouched\r\nback to the bar and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLan\xe2\x80\x99lord, what\xe2\x80\x99s your idea for rakin\xe2\x80\x99 up old personalities and blowin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nabout your father? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t this company agreeable to you? Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? If\r\nthis company ain\xe2\x80\x99t agreeable to you, p\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps we\xe2\x80\x99d better leave. Is that\r\nyour idea? Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re coming at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy bless your soul, Arkansas, I warn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of such a thing. My\r\nfather and my mother\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLan\xe2\x80\x99lord, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ crowd a man! Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.

What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you this\r\nmornin\xe2\x80\x99, anyway? I never see a man carry on so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArkansas, I reely didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean no harm, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t go on with it if\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s onpleasant to you. I reckon my licker\xe2\x80\x99s got into my head, and what\r\nwith the flood, and havin\xe2\x80\x99 so many to feed and look out for\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo _that\xe2\x80\x99s_ what\xe2\x80\x99s a-ranklin\xe2\x80\x99 in your heart, is it? You want us to\r\nleave do you? There\xe2\x80\x99s too many on us. You want us to pack up and swim.\r\nIs that it? Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease be reasonable, Arkansas. Now _you_ know that I ain\xe2\x80\x99t the man\r\nto\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a threatenin\xe2\x80\x99 me? Are you? By George, the man don\xe2\x80\x99t live that\r\ncan skeer me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you try to come that game, my chicken\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99cuz I can\r\nstand a good deal, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t stand that. Come out from behind that bar\r\ntill I clean you! You want to drive us out, do you, you sneakin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nunderhanded hound! Come out from behind that bar! _I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ learn you to\r\nbully and badger and browbeat a gentleman that\xe2\x80\x99s forever trying to\r\nbefriend you and keep you out of trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease, Arkansas, please don\xe2\x80\x99t shoot! If there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be bloodshed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that, gentlemen? Do you hear him talk about bloodshed? So\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s blood you want, is it, you ravin\xe2\x80\x99 desperado! You\xe2\x80\x99d made up your\r\nmind to murder somebody this mornin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94I knowed it perfectly well. I\xe2\x80\x99m the\r\nman, am I? It\xe2\x80\x99s me you\xe2\x80\x99re goin\xe2\x80\x99 to murder, is it? But you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it\r\n\xe2\x80\x99thout I get one chance first, you thievin\xe2\x80\x99 black-hearted, white-livered\r\nson of a nigger! Draw your weepon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, Arkansas began to shoot, and the landlord to clamber over\r\nbenches, men and every sort of obstacle in a frantic desire to escape.\r\nIn the midst of the wild hubbub the landlord crashed through a glass\r\ndoor, and as Arkansas charged after him the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s wife suddenly\r\nappeared in the doorway and confronted the desperado with a pair of\r\nscissors! Her fury was magnificent. With head erect and flashing eye she\r\nstood a moment and then advanced, with her weapon raised. The astonished\r\nruffian hesitated, and then fell back a step. She followed. She backed\r\nhim step by step into the middle of the bar-room, and then, while the\r\nwondering crowd closed up and gazed, she gave him such another tongue-\r\nlashing as never a cowed and shamefaced braggart got before, perhaps! As\r\nshe finished and retired victorious, a roar of applause shook the house,\r\nand every man ordered \xe2\x80\x9cdrinks for the crowd\xe2\x80\x9d in one and the same breath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n225.jpg (102K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lesson was entirely sufficient. The reign of terror was over, and\r\nthe Arkansas domination broken for good. During the rest of the season\r\nof island captivity, there was one man who sat apart in a state of\r\npermanent humiliation, never mixing in any quarrel or uttering a boast,\r\nand never resenting the insults the once cringing crew now constantly\r\nleveled at him, and that man was \xe2\x80\x9cArkansas.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy the fifth or sixth morning the waters had subsided from the land, but\r\nthe stream in the old river bed was still high and swift and there was\r\nno possibility of crossing it. On the eighth it was still too high for\r\nan entirely safe passage, but life in the inn had become next to\r\ninsupportable by reason of the dirt, drunkenness, fighting, etc., and so\r\nwe made an effort to get away. In the midst of a heavy snow-storm we\r\nembarked in a canoe, taking our saddles aboard and towing our horses\r\nafter us by their halters. The Prussian, Ollendorff, was in the bow,\r\nwith a paddle, Ballou paddled in the middle, and I sat in the stern\r\nholding the halters. When the horses lost their footing and began to\r\nswim, Ollendorff got frightened, for there was great danger that the\r\nhorses would make our aim uncertain, and it was plain that if we failed\r\nto land at a certain spot the current would throw us off and almost\r\nsurely cast us into the main Carson, which was a boiling torrent, now.\r\nSuch a catastrophe would be death, in all probability, for we would be\r\nswept to sea in the \xe2\x80\x9cSink\xe2\x80\x9d or overturned and drowned. We warned\r\nOllendorff to keep his wits about him and handle himself carefully, but\r\nit was useless; the moment the bow touched the bank, he made a spring\r\nand the canoe whirled upside down in ten-foot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n227.jpg (95K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOllendorff seized some brush and dragged himself ashore, but Ballou and\r\nI had to swim for it, encumbered with our overcoats. But we held on to\r\nthe canoe, and although we were washed down nearly to the Carson, we\r\nmanaged to push the boat ashore and make a safe landing. We were cold\r\nand water- soaked, but safe. The horses made a landing, too, but our\r\nsaddles were gone, of course. We tied the animals in the sage-brush and\r\nthere they had to stay for twenty-four hours. We baled out the canoe and\r\nferried over some food and blankets for them, but we slept one more\r\nnight in the inn before making another venture on our journey.\r\n\r\nThe next morning it was still snowing furiously when we got away with\r\nour new stock of saddles and accoutrements. We mounted and started. The\r\nsnow lay so deep on the ground that there was no sign of a road\r\nperceptible, and the snow-fall was so thick that we could not see more\r\nthan a hundred yards ahead, else we could have guided our course by the\r\nmountain ranges. The case looked dubious, but Ollendorff said his\r\ninstinct was as sensitive as any compass, and that he could \xe2\x80\x9cstrike a\r\nbee-line\xe2\x80\x9d for Carson city and never diverge from it. He said that if he\r\nwere to straggle a single point out of the true line his instinct would\r\nassail him like an outraged conscience. Consequently we dropped into his\r\nwake happy and content. For half an hour we poked along warily enough,\r\nbut at the end of that time we came upon a fresh trail, and Ollendorff\r\nshouted proudly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew I was as dead certain as a compass, boys! Here we are, right in\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s tracks that will hunt the way for us without any trouble.\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s hurry up and join company with the party.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we put the horses into as much of a trot as the deep snow would\r\nallow, and before long it was evident that we were gaining on our\r\npredecessors, for the tracks grew more distinct. We hurried along, and\r\nat the end of an hour the tracks looked still newer and fresher\xe2\x80\x94but what\r\nsurprised us was, that the _number_ of travelers in advance of us seemed\r\nto steadily increase. We wondered how so large a party came to be\r\ntraveling at such a time and in such a solitude. Somebody suggested that\r\nit must be a company of soldiers from the fort, and so we accepted that\r\nsolution and jogged along a little faster still, for they could not be\r\nfar off now. But the tracks still multiplied, and we began to think the\r\nplatoon of soldiers was miraculously expanding into a regiment\xe2\x80\x94Ballou\r\nsaid they had already increased to five hundred! Presently he stopped\r\nhis horse and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoys, these are our own tracks, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been circussing\r\nround and round in a circle for more than two hours, out here in this\r\nblind desert! By George this is perfectly hydraulic!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n229.jpg (83K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the old man waxed wroth and abusive. He called Ollendorff all\r\nmanner of hard names\xe2\x80\x94said he never saw such a lurid fool as he was, and\r\nended with the peculiarly venomous opinion that he \xe2\x80\x9cdid not know as much\r\nas a logarythm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe certainly had been following our own tracks. Ollendorff and his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmental compass\xe2\x80\x9d were in disgrace from that moment.\r\n\r\nAfter all our hard travel, here we were on the bank of the stream again,\r\nwith the inn beyond dimly outlined through the driving snow-fall. While\r\nwe were considering what to do, the young Swede landed from the canoe\r\nand took his pedestrian way Carson-wards, singing his same tiresome song\r\nabout his \xe2\x80\x9csister and his brother\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe child in the grave with its\r\nmother,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a short minute faded and disappeared in the white\r\noblivion. He was never heard of again. He no doubt got bewildered and\r\nlost, and Fatigue delivered him over to Sleep and Sleep betrayed him to\r\nDeath. Possibly he followed our treacherous tracks till he became\r\nexhausted and dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n230.jpg (20K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently the Overland stage forded the now fast receding stream and\r\nstarted toward Carson on its first trip since the flood came. We\r\nhesitated no longer, now, but took up our march in its wake, and trotted\r\nmerrily along, for we had good confidence in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s bump of\r\nlocality. But our horses were no match for the fresh stage team. We were\r\nsoon left out of sight; but it was no matter, for we had the deep ruts\r\nthe wheels made for a guide. By this time it was three in the afternoon,\r\nand consequently it was not very long before night came\xe2\x80\x94and not with a\r\nlingering twilight, but with a sudden shutting down like a cellar door,\r\nas is its habit in that country. The snowfall was still as thick as\r\never, and of course we could not see fifteen steps before us; but all\r\nabout us the white glare of the snow-bed enabled us to discern the\r\nsmooth sugar-loaf mounds made by the covered sage-bushes, and just in\r\nfront of us the two faint grooves which we knew were the steadily\r\nfilling and slowly disappearing wheel-tracks.\r\n\r\nNow those sage-bushes were all about the same height\xe2\x80\x94three or four feet;\r\nthey stood just about seven feet apart, all over the vast desert; each\r\nof them was a mere snow-mound, now; in _any_ direction that you\r\nproceeded (the same as in a well laid out orchard) you would find\r\nyourself moving down a distinctly defined avenue, with a row of these\r\nsnow-mounds an either side of it\xe2\x80\x94an avenue the customary width of a\r\nroad, nice and level in its breadth, and rising at the sides in the most\r\nnatural way, by reason of the mounds. But we had not thought of this.\r\nThen imagine the chilly thrill that shot through us when it finally\r\noccurred to us, far in the night, that since the last faint trace of the\r\nwheel-tracks had long ago been buried from sight, we might now be\r\nwandering down a mere sage-brush avenue, miles away from the road and\r\ndiverging further and further away from it all the time. Having a cake\r\nof ice slipped down one\xe2\x80\x99s back is placid comfort compared to it. There\r\nwas a sudden leap and stir of blood that had been asleep for an hour,\r\nand as sudden a rousing of all the drowsing activities in our minds and\r\nbodies. We were alive and awake at once\xe2\x80\x94and shaking and quaking with\r\nconsternation, too. There was an instant halting and dismounting, a\r\nbending low and an anxious scanning of the road-bed. Useless, of course;\r\nfor if a faint depression could not be discerned from an altitude of\r\nfour or five feet above it, it certainly could not with one\xe2\x80\x99s nose\r\nnearly against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n231.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe seemed to be in a road, but that was no proof. We tested this by\r\nwalking off in various directions\xe2\x80\x94the regular snow-mounds and the\r\nregular avenues between them convinced each man that _he_ had found the\r\ntrue road, and that the others had found only false ones. Plainly the\r\nsituation was desperate. We were cold and stiff and the horses were\r\ntired. We decided to build a sage-brush fire and camp out till morning.\r\nThis was wise, because if we were wandering from the right road and the\r\nsnow-storm continued another day our case would be the next thing to\r\nhopeless if we kept on.\r\n\r\nAll agreed that a camp fire was what would come nearest to saving us,\r\nnow, and so we set about building it. We could find no matches, and so\r\nwe tried to make shift with the pistols. Not a man in the party had ever\r\ntried to do such a thing before, but not a man in the party doubted that\r\nit _could_ be done, and without any trouble\xe2\x80\x94because every man in the\r\nparty had read about it in books many a time and had naturally come to\r\nbelieve it, with trusting simplicity, just as he had long ago accepted\r\nand believed that _other_ common book-fraud about Indians and lost\r\nhunters making a fire by rubbing two dry sticks together.\r\n\r\nWe huddled together on our knees in the deep snow, and the horses put\r\ntheir noses together and bowed their patient heads over us; and while\r\nthe feathery flakes eddied down and turned us into a group of white\r\nstatuary, we proceeded with the momentous experiment. We broke twigs\r\nfrom a sage bush and piled them on a little cleared place in the shelter\r\nof our bodies. In the course of ten or fifteen minutes all was ready,\r\nand then, while conversation ceased and our pulses beat low with anxious\r\nsuspense, Ollendorff applied his revolver, pulled the trigger and blew\r\nthe pile clear out of the county! It was the flattest failure that ever\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n233.jpg (89K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was distressing, but it paled before a greater horror\xe2\x80\x94the horses\r\nwere gone! I had been appointed to hold the bridles, but in my absorbing\r\nanxiety over the pistol experiment I had unconsciously dropped them and\r\nthe released animals had walked off in the storm. It was useless to try\r\nto follow them, for their footfalls could make no sound, and one could\r\npass within two yards of the creatures and never see them. We gave them\r\nup without an effort at recovering them, and cursed the lying books that\r\nsaid horses would stay by their masters for protection and companionship\r\nin a distressful time like ours.\r\n\r\nWe were miserable enough, before; we felt still more forlorn, now.\r\nPatiently, but with blighted hope, we broke more sticks and piled them,\r\nand once more the Prussian shot them into annihilation. Plainly, to\r\nlight a fire with a pistol was an art requiring practice and experience,\r\nand the middle of a desert at midnight in a snow-storm was not a good\r\nplace or time for the acquiring of the accomplishment. We gave it up and\r\ntried the other. Each man took a couple of sticks and fell to chafing\r\nthem together. At the end of half an hour we were thoroughly chilled,\r\nand so were the sticks. We bitterly execrated the Indians, the hunters\r\nand the books that had betrayed us with the silly device, and wondered\r\ndismally what was next to be done. At this critical moment Mr. Ballou\r\nfished out four matches from the rubbish of an overlooked pocket. To\r\nhave found four gold bars would have seemed poor and cheap good luck\r\ncompared to this.\r\n\r\nOne cannot think how good a match looks under such circumstances\xe2\x80\x94or how\r\nlovable and precious, and sacredly beautiful to the eye. This time we\r\ngathered sticks with high hopes; and when Mr. Ballou prepared to light\r\nthe first match, there was an amount of interest centred upon him that\r\npages of writing could not describe. The match burned hopefully a\r\nmoment, and then went out. It could not have carried more regret with it\r\nif it had been a human life. The next match simply flashed and died. The\r\nwind puffed the third one out just as it was on the imminent verge of\r\nsuccess. We gathered together closer than ever, and developed a\r\nsolicitude that was rapt and painful, as Mr. Ballou scratched our last\r\nhope on his leg. It lit, burned blue and sickly, and then budded into a\r\nrobust flame. Shading it with his hands, the old gentleman bent\r\ngradually down and every heart went with him\xe2\x80\x94everybody, too, for that\r\nmatter\xe2\x80\x94and blood and breath stood still. The flame touched the sticks at\r\nlast, took gradual hold upon them\xe2\x80\x94hesitated\xe2\x80\x94took a stronger\r\nhold\xe2\x80\x94hesitated again\xe2\x80\x94held its breath five heart-breaking seconds, then\r\ngave a sort of human gasp and went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n234.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNobody said a word for several minutes. It was a solemn sort of silence;\r\neven the wind put on a stealthy, sinister quiet, and made no more noise\r\nthan the falling flakes of snow. Finally a sad-voiced conversation\r\nbegan, and it was soon apparent that in each of our hearts lay the\r\nconviction that this was our last night with the living. I had so hoped\r\nthat I was the only one who felt so. When the others calmly acknowledged\r\ntheir conviction, it sounded like the summons itself. Ollendorff said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrothers, let us die together. And let us go without one hard feeling\r\ntowards each other. Let us forget and forgive bygones. I know that you\r\nhave felt hard towards me for turning over the canoe, and for knowing\r\ntoo much and leading you round and round in the snow\xe2\x80\x94but I meant well;\r\nforgive me. I acknowledge freely that I have had hard feelings against\r\nMr. Ballou for abusing me and calling me a logarythm, which is a thing I\r\ndo not know what, but no doubt a thing considered disgraceful and\r\nunbecoming in America, and it has scarcely been out of my mind and has\r\nhurt me a great deal\xe2\x80\x94but let it go; I forgive Mr. Ballou with all my\r\nheart, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor Ollendorff broke down and the tears came. He was not alone, for I\r\nwas crying too, and so was Mr. Ballou. Ollendorff got his voice again\r\nand forgave me for things I had done and said. Then he got out his\r\nbottle of whisky and said that whether he lived or died he would never\r\ntouch another drop. He said he had given up all hope of life, and\r\nalthough ill-prepared, was ready to submit humbly to his fate; that he\r\nwished he could be spared a little longer, not for any selfish reason,\r\nbut to make a thorough reform in his character, and by devoting himself\r\nto helping the poor, nursing the sick, and pleading with the people to\r\nguard themselves against the evils of intemperance, make his life a\r\nbeneficent example to the young, and lay it down at last with the\r\nprecious reflection that it had not been lived in vain. He ended by\r\nsaying that his reform should begin at this moment, even here in the\r\npresence of death, since no longer time was to be vouchsafed wherein to\r\nprosecute it to men\xe2\x80\x99s help and benefit\xe2\x80\x94and with that he threw away the\r\nbottle of whisky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n236.jpg (21K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ballou made remarks of similar purport, and began the reform he\r\ncould not live to continue, by throwing away the ancient pack of cards\r\nthat had solaced our captivity during the flood and made it bearable.\r\n\r\nHe said he never gambled, but still was satisfied that the meddling with\r\ncards in any way was immoral and injurious, and no man could be wholly\r\npure and blemishless without eschewing them. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d continued\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x9cin doing this act I already feel more in sympathy with that\r\nspiritual saturnalia necessary to entire and obsolete reform.\xe2\x80\x9d These\r\nrolling syllables touched him as no intelligible eloquence could have\r\ndone, and the old man sobbed with a mournfulness not unmingled with\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nMy own remarks were of the same tenor as those of my comrades, and I\r\nknow that the feelings that prompted them were heartfelt and sincere. We\r\nwere all sincere, and all deeply moved and earnest, for we were in the\r\npresence of death and without hope. I threw away my pipe, and in doing\r\nit felt that at last I was free of a hated vice and one that had ridden\r\nme like a tyrant all my days. While I yet talked, the thought of the\r\ngood I might have done in the world and the still greater good I might\r\n_now_ do, with these new incentives and higher and better aims to guide\r\nme if I could only be spared a few years longer, overcame me and the\r\ntears came again. We put our arms about each other\xe2\x80\x99s necks and awaited\r\nthe warning drowsiness that precedes death by freezing.\r\n\r\nIt came stealing over us presently, and then we bade each other a last\r\nfarewell. A delicious dreaminess wrought its web about my yielding\r\nsenses, while the snow-flakes wove a winding sheet about my conquered\r\nbody. Oblivion came. The battle of life was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n237.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know how long I was in a state of forgetfulness, but it seemed\r\nan age. A vague consciousness grew upon me by degrees, and then came a\r\ngathering anguish of pain in my limbs and through all my body. I\r\nshuddered. The thought flitted through my brain, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is death\xe2\x80\x94this is\r\nthe hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen came a white upheaval at my side, and a voice said, with\r\nbitterness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill some gentleman be so good as to kick me behind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was Ballou\xe2\x80\x94at least it was a towzled snow image in a sitting posture,\r\nwith Ballou\xe2\x80\x99s voice.\r\n\r\nI rose up, and there in the gray dawn, not fifteen steps from us, were\r\nthe frame buildings of a stage station, and under a shed stood our still\r\nsaddled and bridled horses!\r\n\r\nAn arched snow-drift broke up, now, and Ollendorff emerged from it, and\r\nthe three of us sat and stared at the houses without speaking a word. We\r\nreally had nothing to say. We were like the profane man who could not\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdo the subject justice,\xe2\x80\x9d the whole situation was so painfully\r\nridiculous and humiliating that words were tame and we did not know\r\nwhere to commence anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe joy in our hearts at our deliverance was poisoned; well-nigh\r\ndissipated, indeed. We presently began to grow pettish by degrees, and\r\nsullen; and then, angry at each other, angry at ourselves, angry at\r\neverything in general, we moodily dusted the snow from our clothing and\r\nin unsociable single file plowed our way to the horses, unsaddled them,\r\nand sought shelter in the station.\r\n\r\nI have scarcely exaggerated a detail of this curious and absurd\r\nadventure. It occurred almost exactly as I have stated it. We actually\r\nwent into camp in a snow-drift in a desert, at midnight in a storm,\r\nforlorn and hopeless, within fifteen steps of a comfortable inn.\r\n\r\nFor two hours we sat apart in the station and ruminated in disgust. The\r\nmystery was gone, now, and it was plain enough why the horses had\r\ndeserted us. Without a doubt they were under that shed a quarter of a\r\nminute after they had left us, and they must have overheard and enjoyed\r\nall our confessions and lamentations.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we felt better, and the zest of life soon came back. The\r\nworld looked bright again, and existence was as dear to us as ever.\r\nPresently an uneasiness came over me\xe2\x80\x94grew upon me\xe2\x80\x94assailed me without\r\nceasing. Alas, my regeneration was not complete\xe2\x80\x94I wanted to smoke! I\r\nresisted with all my strength, but the flesh was weak. I wandered away\r\nalone and wrestled with myself an hour. I recalled my promises of reform\r\nand preached to myself persuasively, upbraidingly, exhaustively. But it\r\nwas all vain, I shortly found myself sneaking among the snow-drifts\r\nhunting for my pipe. I discovered it after a considerable search, and\r\ncrept away to hide myself and enjoy it. I remained behind the barn a\r\ngood while, asking myself how I would feel if my braver, stronger, truer\r\ncomrades should catch me in my degradation. At last I lit the pipe, and\r\nno human being can feel meaner and baser than I did then. I was ashamed\r\nof being in my own pitiful company. Still dreading discovery, I felt\r\nthat perhaps the further side of the barn would be somewhat safer, and\r\nso I turned the corner. As I turned the one corner, smoking, Ollendorff\r\nturned the other with his bottle to his lips, and between us sat\r\nunconscious Ballou deep in a game of \xe2\x80\x9csolitaire\xe2\x80\x9d with the old greasy\r\ncards!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n240.jpg (102K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsurdity could go no farther. We shook hands and agreed to say no more\r\nabout \xe2\x80\x9creform\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexamples to the rising generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe station we were at was at the verge of the Twenty-six-Mile Desert.\r\nIf we had approached it half an hour earlier the night before, we must\r\nhave heard men shouting there and firing pistols; for they were\r\nexpecting some sheep drovers and their flocks and knew that they would\r\ninfallibly get lost and wander out of reach of help unless guided by\r\nsounds.\r\n\r\nWhile we remained at the station, three of the drovers arrived, nearly\r\nexhausted with their wanderings, but two others of their party were\r\nnever heard of afterward.\r\n\r\nWe reached Carson in due time, and took a rest. This rest, together with\r\npreparations for the journey to Esmeralda, kept us there a week, and the\r\ndelay gave us the opportunity to be present at the trial of the great\r\nland-slide case of Hyde _vs_. Morgan\xe2\x80\x94an episode which is famous in\r\nNevada to this day. After a word or two of necessary explanation, I will\r\nset down the history of this singular affair just as it transpired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountains are very high and steep about Carson, Eagle and Washoe\r\nValleys\xe2\x80\x94very high and very steep, and so when the snow gets to melting\r\noff fast in the Spring and the warm surface-earth begins to moisten and\r\nsoften, the disastrous land-slides commence. The reader cannot know what\r\na land-slide is, unless he has lived in that country and seen the whole\r\nside of a mountain taken off some fine morning and deposited down in the\r\nvalley, leaving a vast, treeless, unsightly scar upon the mountain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfront to keep the circumstance fresh in his memory all the years that he\r\nmay go on living within seventy miles of that place.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buncombe was shipped out to Nevada in the invoice of Territorial\r\nofficers, to be United States Attorney. He considered himself a lawyer\r\nof parts, and he very much wanted an opportunity to manifest it\xe2\x80\x94partly\r\nfor the pure gratification of it and partly because his salary was\r\nTerritorially meagre (which is a strong expression). Now the older\r\ncitizens of a new territory look down upon the rest of the world with a\r\ncalm, benevolent compassion, as long as it keeps out of the way\xe2\x80\x94when it\r\ngets in the way they snub it. Sometimes this latter takes the shape of a\r\npractical joke.\r\n\r\nOne morning Dick Hyde rode furiously up to General Buncombe\xe2\x80\x99s door in\r\nCarson city and rushed into his presence without stopping to tie his\r\nhorse. He seemed much excited. He told the General that he wanted him to\r\nconduct a suit for him and would pay him five hundred dollars if he\r\nachieved a victory. And then, with violent gestures and a world of\r\nprofanity, he poured out his grief. He said it was pretty well known\r\nthat for some years he had been farming (or ranching as the more\r\ncustomary term is) in Washoe District, and making a successful thing of\r\nit, and furthermore it was known that his ranch was situated just in the\r\nedge of the valley, and that Tom Morgan owned a ranch immediately above\r\nit on the mountain side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n242.jpg (114K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the trouble was, that one of those hated and dreaded land-slides\r\nhad come and slid Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s ranch, fences, cabins, cattle, barns and\r\neverything down on top of _his_ ranch and exactly covered up every\r\nsingle vestige of his property, to a depth of about thirty-eight feet.\r\nMorgan was in possession and refused to vacate the premises\xe2\x80\x94said he was\r\noccupying his own cabin and not interfering with anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and said\r\nthe cabin was standing on the same dirt and same ranch it had always\r\nstood on, and he would like to see anybody make him vacate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when I reminded him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hyde, weeping, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it was on top of my\r\nranch and that he was trespassing, he had the infernal meanness to ask\r\nme why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I _stay_ on my ranch and hold possession when I see him a-\r\ncoming! Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I _stay_ on it, the blathering lunatic\xe2\x80\x94by George,\r\nwhen I heard that racket and looked up that hill it was just like the\r\nwhole world was a-ripping and a-tearing down that mountain\r\nside\xe2\x80\x94splinters, and cord-wood, thunder and lightning, hail and snow,\r\nodds and ends of hay stacks, and awful clouds of dust!\xe2\x80\x94trees going end\r\nover end in the air, rocks as big as a house jumping \xe2\x80\x99bout a thousand\r\nfeet high and busting into ten million pieces, cattle turned inside out\r\nand a-coming head on with their tails hanging out between their\r\nteeth!\xe2\x80\x94and in the midst of all that wrack and destruction sot that\r\ncussed Morgan on his gate-post, a-wondering why _I_ didn\xe2\x80\x99t _stay_ and\r\nhold possession! Laws bless me, I just took one glimpse, General, and\r\nlit out\xe2\x80\x99n the county in three jumps exactly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what grinds me is that that Morgan hangs on there and won\xe2\x80\x99t move\r\noff\xe2\x80\x99n that ranch\xe2\x80\x94says it\xe2\x80\x99s his\xe2\x80\x99n and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep it\xe2\x80\x94likes it\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x99n he did when it was higher up the hill. Mad! Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so\r\nmad for two days I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find my way to town\xe2\x80\x94been wandering around in\r\nthe brush in a starving condition\xe2\x80\x94got anything here to drink, General?\r\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99m here _now_, and I\xe2\x80\x99m a-going to law. You hear _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever in all the world, perhaps, were a man\xe2\x80\x99s feelings so outraged as\r\nwere the General\xe2\x80\x99s. He said he had never heard of such high-handed\r\nconduct in all his life as this Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s. And he said there was no use\r\nin going to law\xe2\x80\x94Morgan had no shadow of right to remain where he\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94nobody in the wide world would uphold him in it, and no lawyer would\r\ntake his case and no judge listen to it. Hyde said that right there was\r\nwhere he was mistaken\xe2\x80\x94everybody in town sustained Morgan; Hal Brayton, a\r\nvery smart lawyer, had taken his case; the courts being in vacation, it\r\nwas to be tried before a referee, and ex-Governor Roop had already been\r\nappointed to that office and would open his court in a large public hall\r\nnear the hotel at two that afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe General was amazed. He said he had suspected before that the people\r\nof that Territory were fools, and now he knew it. But he said rest easy,\r\nrest easy and collect the witnesses, for the victory was just as certain\r\nas if the conflict were already over. Hyde wiped away his tears and\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nAt two in the afternoon referee Roop\xe2\x80\x99s Court opened and Roop appeared\r\nthroned among his sheriffs, the witnesses, and spectators, and wearing\r\nupon his face a solemnity so awe-inspiring that some of his fellow-\r\nconspirators had misgivings that maybe he had not comprehended, after\r\nall, that this was merely a joke. An unearthly stillness prevailed, for\r\nat the slightest noise the judge uttered sternly the command:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder in the Court!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the sheriffs promptly echoed it. Presently the General elbowed his\r\nway through the crowd of spectators, with his arms full of law-books,\r\nand on his ears fell an order from the judge which was the first\r\nrespectful recognition of his high official dignity that had ever\r\nsaluted them, and it trickled pleasantly through his whole system:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWay for the United States Attorney!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe witnesses were called\xe2\x80\x94legislators, high government officers,\r\nranchmen, miners, Indians, Chinamen, negroes. Three fourths of them were\r\ncalled by the defendant Morgan, but no matter, their testimony\r\ninvariably went in favor of the plaintiff Hyde. Each new witness only\r\nadded new testimony to the absurdity of a man\xe2\x80\x99s claiming to own another\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s property because his farm had slid down on top of it. Then the\r\nMorgan lawyers made their speeches, and seemed to make singularly weak\r\nones\xe2\x80\x94they did really nothing to help the Morgan cause. And now the\r\nGeneral, with exultation in his face, got up and made an impassioned\r\neffort; he pounded the table, he banged the law-books, he shouted, and\r\nroared, and howled, he quoted from everything and everybody, poetry,\r\nsarcasm, statistics, history, pathos, bathos, blasphemy, and wound up\r\nwith a grand war-whoop for free speech, freedom of the press, free\r\nschools, the Glorious Bird of America and the principles of eternal\r\njustice! [Applause.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n244.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the General sat down, he did it with the conviction that if there\r\nwas anything in good strong testimony, a great speech and believing and\r\nadmiring countenances all around, Mr. Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s case was killed. Ex-\r\nGovernor Roop leant his head upon his hand for some minutes, thinking,\r\nand the still audience waited for his decision. Then he got up and stood\r\nerect, with bended head, and thought again. Then he walked the floor\r\nwith long, deliberate strides, his chin in his hand, and still the\r\naudience waited. At last he returned to his throne, seated himself, and\r\nbegan impressively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I feel the great responsibility that rests upon me this day.\r\nThis is no ordinary case. On the contrary it is plain that it is the\r\nmost solemn and awful that ever man was called upon to decide.\r\nGentlemen, I have listened attentively to the evidence, and have\r\nperceived that the weight of it, the overwhelming weight of it, is in\r\nfavor of the plaintiff Hyde. I have listened also to the remarks of\r\ncounsel, with high interest\xe2\x80\x94and especially will I commend the masterly\r\nand irrefutable logic of the distinguished gentleman who represents the\r\nplaintiff. But gentlemen, let us beware how we allow mere human\r\ntestimony, human ingenuity in argument and human ideas of equity, to\r\ninfluence us at a moment so solemn as this. Gentlemen, it ill becomes\r\nus, worms as we are, to meddle with the decrees of Heaven. It is plain\r\nto me that Heaven, in its inscrutable wisdom, has seen fit to move this\r\ndefendant\xe2\x80\x99s ranch for a purpose. We are but creatures, and we must\r\nsubmit. If Heaven has chosen to favor the defendant Morgan in this\r\nmarked and wonderful manner; and if Heaven, dissatisfied with the\r\nposition of the Morgan ranch upon the mountain side, has chosen to\r\nremove it to a position more eligible and more advantageous for its\r\nowner, it ill becomes us, insects as we are, to question the legality of\r\nthe act or inquire into the reasons that prompted it. No\xe2\x80\x94Heaven created\r\nthe ranches and it is Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative to rearrange them, to\r\nexperiment with them around at its pleasure. It is for us to submit,\r\nwithout repining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n246.jpg (92K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI warn you that this thing which has happened is a thing with which the\r\nsacrilegious hands and brains and tongues of men must not meddle.\r\nGentlemen, it is the verdict of this court that the plaintiff, Richard\r\nHyde, has been deprived of his ranch by the visitation of God! And from\r\nthis decision there is no appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBuncombe seized his cargo of law-books and plunged out of the court-room\r\nfrantic with indignation. He pronounced Roop to be a miraculous fool, an\r\ninspired idiot. In all good faith he returned at night and remonstrated\r\nwith Roop upon his extravagant decision, and implored him to walk the\r\nfloor and think for half an hour, and see if he could not figure out\r\nsome sort of modification of the verdict. Roop yielded at last and got\r\nup to walk. He walked two hours and a half, and at last his face lit up\r\nhappily and he told Buncombe it had occurred to him that the ranch\r\nunderneath the new Morgan ranch still belonged to Hyde, that his title\r\nto the ground was just as good as it had ever been, and therefore he was\r\nof opinion that Hyde had a right to dig it out from under there and\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe General never waited to hear the end of it. He was always an\r\nimpatient and irascible man, that way. At the end of two months the fact\r\nthat he had been played upon with a joke had managed to bore itself,\r\nlike another Hoosac Tunnel, through the solid adamant of his\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we finally left for Esmeralda, horseback, we had an addition to the\r\ncompany in the person of Capt. John Nye, the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s brother. He had\r\na good memory, and a tongue hung in the middle. This is a combination\r\nwhich gives immortality to conversation. Capt. John never suffered the\r\ntalk to flag or falter once during the hundred and twenty miles of the\r\njourney. In addition to his conversational powers, he had one or two\r\nother endowments of a marked character. One was a singular \xe2\x80\x9chandiness\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nabout doing anything and everything, from laying out a railroad or\r\norganizing a political party, down to sewing on buttons, shoeing a\r\nhorse, or setting a broken leg, or a hen. Another was a spirit of\r\naccommodation that prompted him to take the needs, difficulties and\r\nperplexities of anybody and everybody upon his own shoulders at any and\r\nall times, and dispose of them with admirable facility and\r\nalacrity\xe2\x80\x94hence he always managed to find vacant beds in crowded inns,\r\nand plenty to eat in the emptiest larders. And finally, wherever he met\r\na man, woman or child, in camp, inn or desert, he either knew such\r\nparties personally or had been acquainted with a relative of the same.\r\nSuch another traveling comrade was never seen before. I cannot forbear\r\ngiving a specimen of the way in which he overcame difficulties. On the\r\nsecond day out, we arrived, very tired and hungry, at a poor little inn\r\nin the desert, and were told that the house was full, no provisions on\r\nhand, and neither hay nor barley to spare for the horses\xe2\x80\x94must move on.\r\nThe rest of us wanted to hurry on while it was yet light, but Capt. John\r\ninsisted on stopping awhile. We dismounted and entered. There was no\r\nwelcome for us on any face. Capt. John began his blandishments, and\r\nwithin twenty minutes he had accomplished the following things, viz.:\r\nfound old acquaintances in three teamsters; discovered that he used to\r\ngo to school with the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s mother; recognized his wife as a lady\r\nwhose life he had saved once in California, by stopping her runaway\r\nhorse; mended a child\xe2\x80\x99s broken toy and won the favor of its mother, a\r\nguest of the inn; helped the hostler bleed a horse, and prescribed for\r\nanother horse that had the \xe2\x80\x9cheaves\xe2\x80\x9d; treated the entire party three\r\ntimes at the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s bar; produced a later paper than anybody had\r\nseen for a week and sat himself down to read the news to a deeply\r\ninterested audience. The result, summed up, was as follows: The hostler\r\nfound plenty of feed for our horses; we had a trout supper, an\r\nexceedingly sociable time after it, good beds to sleep in, and a\r\nsurprising breakfast in the morning\xe2\x80\x94and when we left, we left lamented\r\nby all! Capt. John had some bad traits, but he had some uncommonly\r\nvaluable ones to offset them with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n249.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEsmeralda was in many respects another Humboldt, but in a little more\r\nforward state. The claims we had been paying assessments on were\r\nentirely worthless, and we threw them away. The principal one cropped\r\nout of the top of a knoll that was fourteen feet high, and the inspired\r\nBoard of Directors were running a tunnel under that knoll to strike the\r\nledge. The tunnel would have to be seventy feet long, and would then\r\nstrike the ledge at the same dept that a _shaft_ twelve feet deep would\r\nhave reached! The Board were living on the \xe2\x80\x9cassessments.\xe2\x80\x9d [N.B.\xe2\x80\x94This\r\nhint comes too late for the enlightenment of New York silver miners;\r\nthey have already learned all about this neat trick by experience.] The\r\nBoard had no desire to strike the ledge, knowing that it was as barren\r\nof silver as a curbstone. This reminiscence calls to mind Jim Townsend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntunnel. He had paid assessments on a mine called the \xe2\x80\x9cDaley\xe2\x80\x9d till he was\r\nwell-nigh penniless. Finally an assessment was levied to run a tunnel\r\ntwo hundred and fifty feet on the Daley, and Townsend went up on the\r\nhill to look into matters.\r\n\r\nHe found the Daley cropping out of the apex of an exceedingly sharp-\r\npointed peak, and a couple of men up there \xe2\x80\x9cfacing\xe2\x80\x9d the proposed tunnel.\r\nTownsend made a calculation. Then he said to the men:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you have taken a contract to run a tunnel into this hill two hundred\r\nand fifty feet to strike this ledge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, do you know that you have got one of the most expensive and\r\narduous undertakings before you that was ever conceived by man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy no\xe2\x80\x94how is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause this hill is only twenty-five feet through from side to side;\r\nand so you have got to build two hundred and twenty-five feet of your\r\ntunnel on trestle-work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n250.jpg (61K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ways of silver mining Boards are exceedingly dark and sinuous.\r\n\r\nWe took up various claims, and _commenced_ shafts and tunnels on them,\r\nbut never finished any of them. We had to do a certain amount of work on\r\neach to \xe2\x80\x9chold\xe2\x80\x9d it, else other parties could seize our property after the\r\nexpiration of ten days. We were always hunting up new claims and doing a\r\nlittle work on them and then waiting for a buyer\xe2\x80\x94who never came. We\r\nnever found any ore that would yield more than fifty dollars a ton; and\r\nas the mills charged fifty dollars a ton for _working_ ore and\r\nextracting the silver, our pocket-money melted steadily away and none\r\nreturned to take its place. We lived in a little cabin and cooked for\r\nourselves; and altogether it was a hard life, though a hopeful one\xe2\x80\x94for\r\nwe never ceased to expect fortune and a customer to burst upon us some\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAt last, when flour reached a dollar a pound, and money could not be\r\nborrowed on the best security at less than _eight per cent a month_ (I\r\nbeing without the security, too), I abandoned mining and went to\r\nmilling. That is to say, I went to work as a common laborer in a quartz\r\nmill, at ten dollars a week and board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had already learned how hard and long and dismal a task it is to\r\nburrow down into the bowels of the earth and get out the coveted ore;\r\nand now I learned that the burrowing was only half the work; and that to\r\nget the silver out of the ore was the dreary and laborious other half of\r\nit. We had to turn out at six in the morning and keep at it till dark.\r\nThis mill was a six-stamp affair, driven by steam. Six tall, upright\r\nrods of iron, as large as a man\xe2\x80\x99s ankle, and heavily shod with a mass of\r\niron and steel at their lower ends, were framed together like a gate,\r\nand these rose and fell, one after the other, in a ponderous dance, in\r\nan iron box called a \xe2\x80\x9cbattery.\xe2\x80\x9d Each of these rods or stamps weighed six\r\nhundred pounds. One of us stood by the battery all day long, breaking up\r\nmasses of silver-bearing rock with a sledge and shoveling it into the\r\nbattery. The ceaseless dance of the stamps pulverized the rock to\r\npowder, and a stream of water that trickled into the battery turned it\r\nto a creamy paste. The minutest particles were driven through a fine\r\nwire screen which fitted close around the battery, and were washed into\r\ngreat tubs warmed by super-heated steam\xe2\x80\x94amalgamating pans, they are\r\ncalled. The mass of pulp in the pans was kept constantly stirred up by\r\nrevolving \xe2\x80\x9cmullers.\xe2\x80\x9d A quantity of quicksilver was kept always in the\r\nbattery, and this seized some of the liberated gold and silver particles\r\nand held on to them; quicksilver was shaken in a fine shower into the\r\npans, also, about every half hour, through a buckskin sack. Quantities\r\nof coarse salt and sulphate of copper were added, from time to time to\r\nassist the amalgamation by destroying base metals which coated the gold\r\nand silver and would not let it unite with the quicksilver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n253.jpg (73K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these tiresome things we had to attend to constantly. Streams of\r\ndirty water flowed always from the pans and were carried off in broad\r\nwooden troughs to the ravine. One would not suppose that atoms of gold\r\nand silver would float on top of six inches of water, but they did; and\r\nin order to catch them, coarse blankets were laid in the troughs, and\r\nlittle obstructing \xe2\x80\x9criffles\xe2\x80\x9d charged with quicksilver were placed here\r\nand there across the troughs also. These riffles had to be cleaned and\r\nthe blankets washed out every evening, to get their precious\r\naccumulations\xe2\x80\x94and after all this eternity of trouble one third of the\r\nsilver and gold in a ton of rock would find its way to the end of the\r\ntroughs in the ravine at last and have to be worked over again some day.\r\nThere is nothing so aggravating as silver milling. There never was any\r\nidle time in that mill. There was always something to do. It is a pity\r\nthat Adam could not have gone straight out of Eden into a quartz mill,\r\nin order to understand the full force of his doom to \xe2\x80\x9cearn his bread by\r\nthe sweat of his brow.\xe2\x80\x9d Every now and then, during the day, we had to\r\nscoop some pulp out of the pans, and tediously \xe2\x80\x9cwash\xe2\x80\x9d it in a horn\r\nspoon\xe2\x80\x94wash it little by little over the edge till at last nothing was\r\nleft but some little dull globules of quicksilver in the bottom. If they\r\nwere soft and yielding, the pan needed some salt or some sulphate of\r\ncopper or some other chemical rubbish to assist digestion; if they were\r\ncrisp to the touch and would retain a dint, they were freighted with all\r\nthe silver and gold they could seize and hold, and consequently the pan\r\nneeded a fresh charge of quicksilver. When there was nothing else to do,\r\none could always \xe2\x80\x9cscreen tailings.\xe2\x80\x9d That is to say, he could shovel up\r\nthe dried sand that had washed down to the ravine through the troughs\r\nand dash it against an upright wire screen to free it from pebbles and\r\nprepare it for working over.\r\n\r\nThe process of amalgamation differed in the various mills, and this\r\nincluded changes in style of pans and other machinery, and a great\r\ndiversity of opinion existed as to the best in use, but none of the\r\nmethods employed, involved the principle of milling ore without\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cscreening the tailings.\xe2\x80\x9d Of all recreations in the world, screening\r\ntailings on a hot day, with a long-handled shovel, is the most\r\nundesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n254.jpg (78K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week the machinery was stopped and we \xe2\x80\x9ccleaned up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat is to say, we got the pulp out of the pans and batteries, and\r\nwashed the mud patiently away till nothing was left but the long\r\naccumulating mass of quicksilver, with its imprisoned treasures. This we\r\nmade into heavy, compact snow-balls, and piled them up in a bright,\r\nluxurious heap for inspection. Making these snow-balls cost me a fine\r\ngold ring\xe2\x80\x94that and ignorance together; for the quicksilver invaded the\r\nring with the same facility with which water saturates a\r\nsponge\xe2\x80\x94separated its particles and the ring crumbled to pieces.\r\n\r\nWe put our pile of quicksilver balls into an iron retort that had a pipe\r\nleading from it to a pail of water, and then applied a roasting heat.\r\nThe quicksilver turned to vapor, escaped through the pipe into the pail,\r\nand the water turned it into good wholesome quicksilver again.\r\nQuicksilver is very costly, and they never waste it. On opening the\r\nretort, there was our week\xe2\x80\x99s work\xe2\x80\x94a lump of pure white, frosty looking\r\nsilver, twice as large as a man\xe2\x80\x99s head. Perhaps a fifth of the mass was\r\ngold, but the color of it did not show\xe2\x80\x94would not have shown if two\r\nthirds of it had been gold. We melted it up and made a solid brick of it\r\nby pouring it into an iron brick-mould.\r\n\r\nBy such a tedious and laborious process were silver bricks obtained.\r\nThis mill was but one of many others in operation at the time. The first\r\none in Nevada was built at Egan Canyon and was a small insignificant\r\naffair and compared most unfavorably with some of the immense\r\nestablishments afterwards located at Virginia City and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n256.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom our bricks a little corner was chipped off for the \xe2\x80\x9cfire-assay\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmethod used to determine the proportions of gold, silver and base metals\r\nin the mass. This is an interesting process. The chip is hammered out as\r\nthin as paper and weighed on scales so fine and sensitive that if you\r\nweigh a two-inch scrap of paper on them and then write your name on the\r\npaper with a course, soft pencil and weigh it again, the scales will\r\ntake marked notice of the addition.\r\n\r\nThen a little lead (also weighed) is rolled up with the flake of silver\r\nand the two are melted at a great heat in a small vessel called a cupel,\r\nmade by compressing bone ashes into a cup-shape in a steel mold. The\r\nbase metals oxydize and are absorbed with the lead into the pores of the\r\ncupel. A button or globule of perfectly pure gold and silver is left\r\nbehind, and by weighing it and noting the loss, the assayer knows the\r\nproportion of base metal the brick contains. He has to separate the gold\r\nfrom the silver now. The button is hammered out flat and thin, put in\r\nthe furnace and kept some time at a red heat; after cooling it off it is\r\nrolled up like a quill and heated in a glass vessel containing nitric\r\nacid; the acid dissolves the silver and leaves the gold pure and ready\r\nto be weighed on its own merits. Then salt water is poured into the\r\nvessel containing the dissolved silver and the silver returns to\r\npalpable form again and sinks to the bottom. Nothing now remains but to\r\nweigh it; then the proportions of the several metals contained in the\r\nbrick are known, and the assayer stamps the value of the brick upon its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious reader will know now, without being told, that the\r\nspeculative miner, in getting a \xe2\x80\x9cfire-assay\xe2\x80\x9d made of a piece of rock\r\nfrom his mine (to help him sell the same), was not in the habit of\r\npicking out the least valuable fragment of rock on his dump-pile, but\r\nquite the contrary. I have seen men hunt over a pile of nearly worthless\r\nquartz for an hour, and at last find a little piece as large as a\r\nfilbert, which was rich in gold and silver\xe2\x80\x94and this was reserved for a\r\nfire-assay! Of course the fire-assay would demonstrate that a ton of\r\nsuch rock would yield hundreds of dollars\xe2\x80\x94and on such assays many an\r\nutterly worthless mine was sold.\r\n\r\nAssaying was a good business, and so some men engaged in it,\r\noccasionally, who were not strictly scientific and capable. One assayer\r\ngot such rich results out of all specimens brought to him that in time\r\nhe acquired almost a monopoly of the business. But like all men who\r\nachieve success, he became an object of envy and suspicion. The other\r\nassayers entered into a conspiracy against him, and let some prominent\r\ncitizens into the secret in order to show that they meant fairly. Then\r\nthey broke a little fragment off a carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s grindstone and got a\r\nstranger to take it to the popular scientist and get it assayed. In the\r\ncourse of an hour the result came\xe2\x80\x94whereby it appeared that a ton of that\r\nrock would yield $1,184.40 in silver and $366.36 in gold!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n257.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue publication of the whole matter was made in the paper, and the\r\npopular assayer left town \xe2\x80\x9cbetween two days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI will remark, in passing, that I only remained in the milling business\r\none week. I told my employer I could not stay longer without an advance\r\nin my wages; that I liked quartz milling, indeed was infatuated with it;\r\nthat I had never before grown so tenderly attached to an occupation in\r\nso short a time; that nothing, it seemed to me, gave such scope to\r\nintellectual activity as feeding a battery and screening tailings, and\r\nnothing so stimulated the moral attributes as retorting bullion and\r\nwashing blankets\xe2\x80\x94still, I felt constrained to ask an increase of salary.\r\nHe said he was paying me ten dollars a week, and thought it a good round\r\nsum. How much did I want?\r\n\r\nI said about _four hundred thousand_ dollars a month, and board, was\r\nabout all I could reasonably ask, considering the hard times.\r\n\r\nI was ordered off the premises! And yet, when I look back to those days\r\nand call to mind the exceeding hardness of the labor I performed in that\r\nmill, I only regret that I did not ask him seven hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nShortly after this I began to grow crazy, along with the rest of the\r\npopulation, about the mysterious and wonderful \xe2\x80\x9ccement mine,\xe2\x80\x9d and to\r\nmake preparations to take advantage of any opportunity that might offer\r\nto go and help hunt for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was somewhere in the neighborhood of Mono Lake that the marvellous\r\nWhiteman cement mine was supposed to lie. Every now and then it would be\r\nreported that Mr. W. had passed stealthily through Esmeralda at dead of\r\nnight, in disguise, and then we would have a wild excitement\xe2\x80\x94because he\r\nmust be steering for his secret mine, and now was the time to follow\r\nhim. In less than three hours after daylight all the horses and mules\r\nand donkeys in the vicinity would be bought, hired or stolen, and half\r\nthe community would be off for the mountains, following in the wake of\r\nWhiteman. But W. would drift about through the mountain gorges for days\r\ntogether, in a purposeless sort of way, until the provisions of the\r\nminers ran out, and they would have to go back home. I have known it\r\nreported at eleven at night, in a large mining camp, that Whiteman had\r\njust passed through, and in two hours the streets, so quiet before,\r\nwould be swarming with men and animals. Every individual would be trying\r\nto be very secret, but yet venturing to whisper to just one neighbor\r\nthat W. had passed through. And long before daylight\xe2\x80\x94this in the dead of\r\nWinter\xe2\x80\x94the stampede would be complete, the camp deserted, and the whole\r\npopulation gone chasing after W.\r\n\r\nThe tradition was that in the early immigration, more than twenty years\r\nago, three young Germans, brothers, who had survived an Indian massacre\r\non the Plains, wandered on foot through the deserts, avoiding all trails\r\nand roads, and simply holding a westerly direction and hoping to find\r\nCalifornia before they starved, or died of fatigue. And in a gorge in\r\nthe mountains they sat down to rest one day, when one of them noticed a\r\ncurious vein of cement running along the ground, shot full of lumps of\r\ndull yellow metal. They saw that it was gold, and that here was a\r\nfortune to be acquired in a single day. The vein was about as wide as a\r\ncurbstone, and fully two thirds of it was pure gold. Every pound of the\r\nwonderful cement was worth well-nigh $200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n260.jpg (59K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the brothers loaded himself with about twenty-five pounds of it,\r\nand then they covered up all traces of the vein, made a rude drawing of\r\nthe locality and the principal landmarks in the vicinity, and started\r\nwestward again. But troubles thickened about them. In their wanderings\r\none brother fell and broke his leg, and the others were obliged to go on\r\nand leave him to die in the wilderness. Another, worn out and starving,\r\ngave up by and by, and laid down to die, but after two or three weeks of\r\nincredible hardships, the third reached the settlements of California\r\nexhausted, sick, and his mind deranged by his sufferings. He had thrown\r\naway all his cement but a few fragments, but these were sufficient to\r\nset everybody wild with excitement. However, he had had enough of the\r\ncement country, and nothing could induce him to lead a party thither. He\r\nwas entirely content to work on a farm for wages. But he gave Whiteman\r\nhis map, and described the cement region as well as he could and thus\r\ntransferred the curse to that gentleman\xe2\x80\x94for when I had my one accidental\r\nglimpse of Mr. W. in Esmeralda he had been hunting for the lost mine, in\r\nhunger and thirst, poverty and sickness, for twelve or thirteen years.\r\nSome people believed he had found it, but most people believed he had\r\nnot. I saw a piece of cement as large as my fist which was said to have\r\nbeen given to Whiteman by the young German, and it was of a seductive\r\nnature. Lumps of virgin gold were as thick in it as raisins in a slice\r\nof fruit cake. The privilege of working such a mine one week would be\r\nsufficient for a man of reasonable desires.\r\n\r\nA new partner of ours, a Mr. Higbie, knew Whiteman well by sight, and a\r\nfriend of ours, a Mr. Van Dorn, was well acquainted with him, and not\r\nonly that, but had Whiteman\xe2\x80\x99s promise that he should have a private hint\r\nin time to enable him to join the next cement expedition. Van Dorn had\r\npromised to extend the hint to us. One evening Higbie came in greatly\r\nexcited, and said he felt certain he had recognized Whiteman, up town,\r\ndisguised and in a pretended state of intoxication. In a little while\r\nVan Dorn arrived and confirmed the news; and so we gathered in our cabin\r\nand with heads close together arranged our plans in impressive whispers.\r\n\r\nWe were to leave town quietly, after midnight, in two or three small\r\nparties, so as not to attract attention, and meet at dawn on the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdivide\xe2\x80\x9d overlooking Mono Lake, eight or nine miles distant. We were to\r\nmake no noise after starting, and not speak above a whisper under any\r\ncircumstances. It was believed that for once Whiteman\xe2\x80\x99s presence was\r\nunknown in the town and his expedition unsuspected. Our conclave broke\r\nup at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and we set about our preparation diligently and with\r\nprofound secrecy. At eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock we saddled our horses, hitched them\r\nwith their long _riatas_ (or lassos), and then brought out a side of\r\nbacon, a sack of beans, a small sack of coffee, some sugar, a hundred\r\npounds of flour in sacks, some tin cups and a coffee pot, frying pan and\r\nsome few other necessary articles. All these things were \xe2\x80\x9cpacked\xe2\x80\x9d on the\r\nback of a led horse\xe2\x80\x94and whoever has not been taught, by a Spanish adept,\r\nto pack an animal, let him never hope to do the thing by natural\r\nsmartness. That is impossible. Higbie had had some experience, but was\r\nnot perfect. He put on the pack saddle (a thing like a saw-buck), piled\r\nthe property on it and then wound a rope all over and about it and under\r\nit, \xe2\x80\x9cevery which way,\xe2\x80\x9d taking a hitch in it every now and then, and\r\noccasionally surging back on it till the horse\xe2\x80\x99s sides sunk in and he\r\ngasped for breath\xe2\x80\x94but every time the lashings grew tight in one place\r\nthey loosened in another. We never did get the load tight all over, but\r\nwe got it so that it would do, after a fashion, and then we started, in\r\nsingle file, close order, and without a word. It was a dark night. We\r\nkept the middle of the road, and proceeded in a slow walk past the rows\r\nof cabins, and whenever a miner came to his door I trembled for fear the\r\nlight would shine on us and excite curiosity. But nothing happened. We\r\nbegan the long winding ascent of the canyon, toward the \xe2\x80\x9cdivide,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\npresently the cabins began to grow infrequent, and the intervals between\r\nthem wider and wider, and then I began to breathe tolerably freely and\r\nfeel less like a thief and a murderer. I was in the rear, leading the\r\npack horse. As the ascent grew steeper he grew proportionately less\r\nsatisfied with his cargo, and began to pull back on his _riata_\r\noccasionally and delay progress. My comrades were passing out of sight\r\nin the gloom. I was getting anxious. I coaxed and bullied the pack horse\r\ntill I presently got him into a trot, and then the tin cups and pans\r\nstrung about his person frightened him and he ran. His _riata_ was wound\r\naround the pummel of my saddle, and so, as he went by he dragged me from\r\nmy horse and the two animals traveled briskly on without me. But I was\r\nnot alone\xe2\x80\x94the loosened cargo tumbled overboard from the pack horse and\r\nfell close to me. It was abreast of almost the last cabin.\r\n\r\nA miner came out and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was thirty steps from him, and knew he could not see me, it was so\r\nvery dark in the shadow of the mountain. So I lay still. Another head\r\nappeared in the light of the cabin door, and presently the two men\r\nwalked toward me. They stopped within ten steps of me, and one said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSt! Listen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n263.jpg (75K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI could not have been in a more distressed state if I had been escaping\r\njustice with a price on my head. Then the miners appeared to sit down on\r\na boulder, though I could not see them distinctly enough to be very sure\r\nwhat they did. One said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a noise, as plain as I ever heard anything. It seemed to be\r\nabout there\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA stone whizzed by my head. I flattened myself out in the dust like a\r\npostage stamp, and thought to myself if he mended his aim ever so little\r\nhe would probably hear another noise. In my heart, now, I execrated\r\nsecret expeditions. I promised myself that this should be my last,\r\nthough the Sierras were ribbed with cement veins. Then one of the men\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what! Welch knew what he was talking about when he said\r\nhe saw Whiteman to-day. I heard horses\xe2\x80\x94that was the noise. I am going\r\ndown to Welch\xe2\x80\x99s, right away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey left and I was glad. I did not care whither they went, so they\r\nwent. I was willing they should visit Welch, and the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they closed their cabin door my comrades emerged from the\r\ngloom; they had caught the horses and were waiting for a clear coast\r\nagain. We remounted the cargo on the pack horse and got under way, and\r\nas day broke we reached the \xe2\x80\x9cdivide\xe2\x80\x9d and joined Van Dorn. Then we\r\njourneyed down into the valley of the Lake, and feeling secure, we\r\nhalted to cook breakfast, for we were tired and sleepy and hungry. Three\r\nhours later the rest of the population filed over the \xe2\x80\x9cdivide\xe2\x80\x9d in a long\r\nprocession, and drifted off out of sight around the borders of the Lake!\r\n\r\nWhether or not my accident had produced this result we never knew, but\r\nat least one thing was certain\xe2\x80\x94the secret was out and Whiteman would not\r\nenter upon a search for the cement mine this time. We were filled with\r\nchagrin.\r\n\r\nWe held a council and decided to make the best of our misfortune and\r\nenjoy a week\xe2\x80\x99s holiday on the borders of the curious Lake. Mono, it is\r\nsometimes called, and sometimes the \xe2\x80\x9cDead Sea of California.\xe2\x80\x9d It is one\r\nof the strangest freaks of Nature to be found in any land, but it is\r\nhardly ever mentioned in print and very seldom visited, because it lies\r\naway off the usual routes of travel and besides is so difficult to get\r\nat that only men content to endure the roughest life will consent to\r\ntake upon themselves the discomforts of such a trip. On the morning of\r\nour second day, we traveled around to a remote and particularly wild\r\nspot on the borders of the Lake, where a stream of fresh, ice-cold water\r\nentered it from the mountain side, and then we went regularly into camp.\r\nWe hired a large boat and two shot-guns from a lonely ranchman who lived\r\nsome ten miles further on, and made ready for comfort and recreation. We\r\nsoon got thoroughly acquainted with the Lake and all its peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMono Lake lies in a lifeless, treeless, hideous desert, eight thousand\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, and is guarded by mountains two\r\nthousand feet higher, whose summits are always clothed in clouds. This\r\nsolemn, silent, sailless sea\xe2\x80\x94this lonely tenant of the loneliest spot on\r\nearth\xe2\x80\x94is little graced with the picturesque. It is an unpretending\r\nexpanse of grayish water, about a hundred miles in circumference, with\r\ntwo islands in its centre, mere upheavals of rent and scorched and\r\nblistered lava, snowed over with gray banks and drifts of pumice-stone\r\nand ashes, the winding sheet of the dead volcano, whose vast crater the\r\nlake has seized upon and occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n265.jpg (138K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lake is two hundred feet deep, and its sluggish waters are so strong\r\nwith alkali that if you only dip the most hopelessly soiled garment into\r\nthem once or twice, and wring it out, it will be found as clean as if it\r\nhad been through the ablest of washerwomen\xe2\x80\x99s hands. While we camped\r\nthere our laundry work was easy. We tied the week\xe2\x80\x99s washing astern of\r\nour boat, and sailed a quarter of a mile, and the job was complete, all\r\nto the wringing out. If we threw the water on our heads and gave them a\r\nrub or so, the white lather would pile up three inches high. This water\r\nis not good for bruised places and abrasions of the skin. We had a\r\nvaluable dog. He had raw places on him. He had more raw places on him\r\nthan sound ones. He was the rawest dog I almost ever saw. He jumped\r\noverboard one day to get away from the flies. But it was bad judgment.\r\nIn his condition, it would have been just as comfortable to jump into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n266a.jpg (44K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alkali water nipped him in all the raw places simultaneously, and he\r\nstruck out for the shore with considerable interest. He yelped and\r\nbarked and howled as he went\xe2\x80\x94and by the time he got to the shore there\r\nwas no bark to him\xe2\x80\x94for he had barked the bark all out of his inside, and\r\nthe alkali water had cleaned the bark all off his outside, and he\r\nprobably wished he had never embarked in any such enterprise. He ran\r\nround and round in a circle, and pawed the earth and clawed the air, and\r\nthrew double somersaults, sometimes backward and sometimes forward, in\r\nthe most extraordinary manner. He was not a demonstrative dog, as a\r\ngeneral thing, but rather of a grave and serious turn of mind, and I\r\nnever saw him take so much interest in anything before. He finally\r\nstruck out over the mountains, at a gait which we estimated at about two\r\nhundred and fifty miles an hour, and he is going yet. This was about\r\nnine years ago. We look for what is left of him along here every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n266b.jpg (51K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA white man cannot drink the water of Mono Lake, for it is nearly pure\r\nlye. It is said that the Indians in the vicinity drink it sometimes,\r\nthough. It is not improbable, for they are among the purest liars I ever\r\nsaw. [There will be no additional charge for this joke, except to\r\nparties requiring an explanation of it. This joke has received high\r\ncommendation from some of the ablest minds of the age.]\r\n\r\nThere are no fish in Mono Lake\xe2\x80\x94no frogs, no snakes, no\r\npolliwigs\xe2\x80\x94nothing, in fact, that goes to make life desirable. Millions\r\nof wild ducks and sea-gulls swim about the surface, but no living thing\r\nexists _under_ the surface, except a white feathery sort of worm, one\r\nhalf an inch long, which looks like a bit of white thread frayed out at\r\nthe sides. If you dip up a gallon of water, you will get about fifteen\r\nthousand of these. They give to the water a sort of grayish-white\r\nappearance. Then there is a fly, which looks something like our house\r\nfly. These settle on the beach to eat the worms that wash ashore\xe2\x80\x94and any\r\ntime, you can see there a belt of flies an inch deep and six feet wide,\r\nand this belt extends clear around the lake\xe2\x80\x94a belt of flies one hundred\r\nmiles long. If you throw a stone among them, they swarm up so thick that\r\nthey look dense, like a cloud. You can hold them under water as long as\r\nyou please\xe2\x80\x94they do not mind it\xe2\x80\x94they are only proud of it. When you let\r\nthem go, they pop up to the surface as dry as a patent office report,\r\nand walk off as unconcernedly as if they had been educated especially\r\nwith a view to affording instructive entertainment to man in that\r\nparticular way. Providence leaves nothing to go by chance. All things\r\nhave their uses and their part and proper place in Nature\xe2\x80\x99s economy: the\r\nducks eat the flies\xe2\x80\x94the flies eat the worms\xe2\x80\x94the Indians eat all\r\nthree\xe2\x80\x94the wild cats eat the Indians\xe2\x80\x94the white folks eat the wild\r\ncats\xe2\x80\x94and thus all things are lovely.\r\n\r\nMono Lake is a hundred miles in a straight line from the ocean\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nbetween it and the ocean are one or two ranges of mountains\xe2\x80\x94yet\r\nthousands of sea-gulls go there every season to lay their eggs and rear\r\ntheir young. One would as soon expect to find sea-gulls in Kansas. And\r\nin this connection let us observe another instance of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom.\r\nThe islands in the lake being merely huge masses of lava, coated over\r\nwith ashes and pumice-stone, and utterly innocent of vegetation or\r\nanything that would burn; and sea-gull\xe2\x80\x99s eggs being entirely useless to\r\nanybody unless they be cooked, Nature has provided an unfailing spring\r\nof boiling water on the largest island, and you can put your eggs in\r\nthere, and in four minutes you can boil them as hard as any statement I\r\nhave made during the past fifteen years. Within ten feet of the boiling\r\nspring is a spring of pure cold water, sweet and wholesome.\r\n\r\nSo, in that island you get your board and washing free of charge\xe2\x80\x94and if\r\nnature had gone further and furnished a nice American hotel clerk who\r\nwas crusty and disobliging, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about the time\r\ntables, or the railroad routes\xe2\x80\x94or\xe2\x80\x94anything\xe2\x80\x94and was proud of it\xe2\x80\x94I would\r\nnot wish for a more desirable boarding-house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n268.jpg (51K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen little mountain brooks flow into Mono Lake, but not a\r\nstream of any kind flows out of it. It neither rises nor falls,\r\napparently, and what it does with its surplus water is a dark and bloody\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nThere are only two seasons in the region round about Mono Lake\xe2\x80\x94and these\r\nare, the breaking up of one Winter and the beginning of the next. More\r\nthan once (in Esmeralda) I have seen a perfectly blistering morning open\r\nup with the thermometer at ninety degrees at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and seen the\r\nsnow fall fourteen inches deep and that same identical thermometer go\r\ndown to forty-four degrees under shelter, before nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night.\r\nUnder favorable circumstances it snows at least once in every single\r\nmonth in the year, in the little town of Mono. So uncertain is the\r\nclimate in Summer that a lady who goes out visiting cannot hope to be\r\nprepared for all emergencies unless she takes her fan under one arm and\r\nher snow shoes under the other. When they have a Fourth of July\r\nprocession it generally snows on them, and they do say that as a general\r\nthing when a man calls for a brandy toddy there, the bar keeper chops it\r\noff with a hatchet and wraps it up in a paper, like maple sugar. And it\r\nis further reported that the old soakers haven\xe2\x80\x99t any teeth\xe2\x80\x94wore them out\r\neating gin cocktails and brandy punches. I do not endorse that\r\nstatement\xe2\x80\x94I simply give it for what it is worth\xe2\x80\x94and it is worth\xe2\x80\x94well, I\r\nshould say, millions, to any man who can believe it without straining\r\nhimself. But I do endorse the snow on the Fourth of July\xe2\x80\x94because I know\r\nthat to be true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock one blistering hot morning\xe2\x80\x94for it was now dead\r\nsummer time\xe2\x80\x94Higbie and I took the boat and started on a voyage of\r\ndiscovery to the two islands. We had often longed to do this, but had\r\nbeen deterred by the fear of storms; for they were frequent, and severe\r\nenough to capsize an ordinary row-boat like ours without great\r\ndifficulty\xe2\x80\x94and once capsized, death would ensue in spite of the bravest\r\nswimming, for that venomous water would eat a man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes out like fire,\r\nand burn him out inside, too, if he shipped a sea. It was called twelve\r\nmiles, straight out to the islands\xe2\x80\x94a long pull and a warm one\xe2\x80\x94but the\r\nmorning was so quiet and sunny, and the lake so smooth and glassy and\r\ndead, that we could not resist the temptation. So we filled two large\r\ntin canteens with water (since we were not acquainted with the locality\r\nof the spring said to exist on the large island), and started. Higbie\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrawny muscles gave the boat good speed, but by the time we reached our\r\ndestination we judged that we had pulled nearer fifteen miles than\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\nWe landed on the big island and went ashore. We tried the water in the\r\ncanteens, now, and found that the sun had spoiled it; it was so brackish\r\nthat we could not drink it; so we poured it out and began a search for\r\nthe spring\xe2\x80\x94for thirst augments fast as soon as it is apparent that one\r\nhas no means at hand of quenching it. The island was a long, moderately\r\nhigh hill of ashes\xe2\x80\x94nothing but gray ashes and pumice-stone, in which we\r\nsunk to our knees at every step\xe2\x80\x94and all around the top was a forbidding\r\nwall of scorched and blasted rocks. When we reached the top and got\r\nwithin the wall, we found simply a shallow, far-reaching basin, carpeted\r\nwith ashes, and here and there a patch of fine sand. In places,\r\npicturesque jets of steam shot up out of crevices, giving evidence that\r\nalthough this ancient crater had gone out of active business, there was\r\nstill some fire left in its furnaces. Close to one of these jets of\r\nsteam stood the only tree on the island\xe2\x80\x94a small pine of most graceful\r\nshape and most faultless symmetry; its color was a brilliant green, for\r\nthe steam drifted unceasingly through its branches and kept them always\r\nmoist. It contrasted strangely enough, did this vigorous and beautiful\r\noutcast, with its dead and dismal surroundings. It was like a cheerful\r\nspirit in a mourning household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n271.jpg (56K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hunted for the spring everywhere, traversing the full length of the\r\nisland (two or three miles), and crossing it twice\xe2\x80\x94climbing ash-hills\r\npatiently, and then sliding down the other side in a sitting posture,\r\nplowing up smothering volumes of gray dust. But we found nothing but\r\nsolitude, ashes and a heart-breaking silence. Finally we noticed that\r\nthe wind had risen, and we forgot our thirst in a solicitude of greater\r\nimportance; for, the lake being quiet, we had not taken pains about\r\nsecuring the boat. We hurried back to a point overlooking our landing\r\nplace, and then\xe2\x80\x94but mere words cannot describe our dismay\xe2\x80\x94the boat was\r\ngone! The chances were that there was not another boat on the entire\r\nlake. The situation was not comfortable\xe2\x80\x94in truth, to speak plainly, it\r\nwas frightful. We were prisoners on a desolate island, in aggravating\r\nproximity to friends who were for the present helpless to aid us; and\r\nwhat was still more uncomfortable was the reflection that we had neither\r\nfood nor water. But presently we sighted the boat. It was drifting\r\nalong, leisurely, about fifty yards from shore, tossing in a foamy sea.\r\nIt drifted, and continued to drift, but at the same safe distance from\r\nland, and we walked along abreast it and waited for fortune to favor us.\r\nAt the end of an hour it approached a jutting cape, and Higbie ran ahead\r\nand posted himself on the utmost verge and prepared for the assault. If\r\nwe failed there, there was no hope for us. It was driving gradually\r\nshoreward all the time, now; but whether it was driving fast enough to\r\nmake the connection or not was the momentous question. When it got\r\nwithin thirty steps of Higbie I was so excited that I fancied I could\r\nhear my own heart beat. When, a little later, it dragged slowly along\r\nand seemed about to go by, only one little yard out of reach, it seemed\r\nas if my heart stood still; and when it was exactly abreast him and\r\nbegan to widen away, and he still standing like a watching statue, I\r\nknew my heart did stop. But when he gave a great spring, the next\r\ninstant, and lit fairly in the stern, I discharged a war-whoop that woke\r\nthe solitudes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n273.jpg (62K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it dulled my enthusiasm, presently, when he told me he had not been\r\ncaring whether the boat came within jumping distance or not, so that it\r\npassed within eight or ten yards of him, for he had made up his mind to\r\nshut his eyes and mouth and swim that trifling distance. Imbecile that I\r\nwas, I had not thought of that. It was only a long swim that could be\r\nfatal.\r\n\r\nThe sea was running high and the storm increasing. It was growing late,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94three or four in the afternoon. Whether to venture toward the\r\nmainland or not, was a question of some moment. But we were so\r\ndistressed by thirst that we decide to try it, and so Higbie fell to\r\nwork and I took the steering-oar. When we had pulled a mile,\r\nlaboriously, we were evidently in serious peril, for the storm had\r\ngreatly augmented; the billows ran very high and were capped with\r\nfoaming crests, the heavens were hung with black, and the wind blew with\r\ngreat fury. We would have gone back, now, but we did not dare to turn\r\nthe boat around, because as soon as she got in the trough of the sea she\r\nwould upset, of course. Our only hope lay in keeping her head-on to the\r\nseas. It was hard work to do this, she plunged so, and so beat and\r\nbelabored the billows with her rising and falling bows. Now and then one\r\nof Higbie\xe2\x80\x99s oars would trip on the top of a wave, and the other one\r\nwould snatch the boat half around in spite of my cumbersome steering\r\napparatus. We were drenched by the sprays constantly, and the boat\r\noccasionally shipped water. By and by, powerful as my comrade was, his\r\ngreat exertions began to tell on him, and he was anxious that I should\r\nchange places with him till he could rest a little. But I told him this\r\nwas impossible; for if the steering oar were dropped a moment while we\r\nchanged, the boat would slue around into the trough of the sea, capsize,\r\nand in less than five minutes we would have a hundred gallons of soap-\r\nsuds in us and be eaten up so quickly that we could not even be present\r\nat our own inquest.\r\n\r\nBut things cannot last always. Just as the darkness shut down we came\r\nbooming into port, head on. Higbie dropped his oars to hurrah\xe2\x80\x94I dropped\r\nmine to help\xe2\x80\x94the sea gave the boat a twist, and over she went!\r\n\r\nThe agony that alkali water inflicts on bruises, chafes and blistered\r\nhands, is unspeakable, and nothing but greasing all over will modify\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94but we ate, drank and slept well, that night, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the peculiarities of Mono Lake, I ought to have mentioned\r\nthat at intervals all around its shores stand picturesque turret-looking\r\nmasses and clusters of a whitish, coarse-grained rock that resembles\r\ninferior mortar dried hard; and if one breaks off fragments of this rock\r\nhe will find perfectly shaped and thoroughly petrified gulls\xe2\x80\x99 eggs\r\ndeeply imbedded in the mass. How did they get there? I simply state the\r\nfact\xe2\x80\x94for it is a fact\xe2\x80\x94and leave the geological reader to crack the nut\r\nat his leisure and solve the problem after his own fashion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week we adjourned to the Sierras on a fishing excursion,\r\nand spent several days in camp under snowy Castle Peak, and fished\r\nsuccessfully for trout in a bright, miniature lake whose surface was\r\nbetween ten and eleven thousand feet above the level of the sea; cooling\r\nourselves during the hot August noons by sitting on snow banks ten feet\r\ndeep, under whose sheltering edges fine grass and dainty flowers\r\nflourished luxuriously; and at night entertaining ourselves by almost\r\nfreezing to death. Then we returned to Mono Lake, and finding that the\r\ncement excitement was over for the present, packed up and went back to\r\nEsmeralda. Mr. Ballou reconnoitred awhile, and not liking the prospect,\r\nset out alone for Humboldt.\r\n\r\nAbout this time occurred a little incident which has always had a sort\r\nof interest to me, from the fact that it came so near \xe2\x80\x9cinstigating\xe2\x80\x9d my\r\nfuneral. At a time when an Indian attack had been expected, the citizens\r\nhid their gunpowder where it would be safe and yet convenient to hand\r\nwhen wanted. A neighbor of ours hid six cans of rifle powder in the\r\nbake-oven of an old discarded cooking stove which stood on the open\r\nground near a frame out-house or shed, and from and after that day never\r\nthought of it again. We hired a half-tamed Indian to do some washing for\r\nus, and he took up quarters under the shed with his tub. The ancient\r\nstove reposed within six feet of him, and before his face. Finally it\r\noccurred to him that hot water would be better than cold, and he went\r\nout and fired up under that forgotten powder magazine and set on a\r\nkettle of water. Then he returned to his tub.\r\n\r\nI entered the shed presently and threw down some more clothes, and was\r\nabout to speak to him when the stove blew up with a prodigious crash,\r\nand disappeared, leaving not a splinter behind. Fragments of it fell in\r\nthe streets full two hundred yards away. Nearly a third of the shed roof\r\nover our heads was destroyed, and one of the stove lids, after cutting a\r\nsmall stanchion half in two in front of the Indian, whizzed between us\r\nand drove partly through the weather-boarding beyond. I was as white as\r\na sheet and as weak as a kitten and speechless. But the Indian betrayed\r\nno trepidation, no distress, not even discomfort. He simply stopped\r\nwashing, leaned forward and surveyed the clean, blank ground a moment,\r\nand then remarked:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n275.jpg (68K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMph! Dam stove heap gone!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and resumed his scrubbing as placidly as if\r\nit were an entirely customary thing for a stove to do. I will explain,\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cheap\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cInjun-English\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cvery much.\xe2\x80\x9d The reader will perceive\r\nthe exhaustive expressiveness of it in the present instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n276.jpg (30K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to a curious episode\xe2\x80\x94the most curious, I think, that had yet\r\naccented my slothful, valueless, heedless career. Out of a hillside\r\ntoward the upper end of the town, projected a wall of reddish looking\r\nquartz-croppings, the exposed comb of a silver-bearing ledge that\r\nextended deep down into the earth, of course. It was owned by a company\r\nentitled the \xe2\x80\x9cWide West.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a shaft sixty or seventy feet deep\r\non the under side of the croppings, and everybody was acquainted with\r\nthe rock that came from it\xe2\x80\x94and tolerably rich rock it was, too, but\r\nnothing extraordinary. I will remark here, that although to the\r\ninexperienced stranger all the quartz of a particular \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict\xe2\x80\x9d looks\r\nabout alike, an old resident of the camp can take a glance at a mixed\r\npile of rock, separate the fragments and tell you which mine each came\r\nfrom, as easily as a confectioner can separate and classify the various\r\nkinds and qualities of candy in a mixed heap of the article.\r\n\r\nAll at once the town was thrown into a state of extraordinary\r\nexcitement. In mining parlance the Wide West had \xe2\x80\x9cstruck it rich!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nEverybody went to see the new developments, and for some days there was\r\nsuch a crowd of people about the Wide West shaft that a stranger would\r\nhave supposed there was a mass meeting in session there. No other topic\r\nwas discussed but the rich strike, and nobody thought or dreamed about\r\nanything else. Every man brought away a specimen, ground it up in a hand\r\nmortar, washed it out in his horn spoon, and glared speechless upon the\r\nmarvelous result. It was not hard rock, but black, decomposed stuff\r\nwhich could be crumbled in the hand like a baked potato, and when spread\r\nout on a paper exhibited a thick sprinkling of gold and particles of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnative\xe2\x80\x9d silver. Higbie brought a handful to the cabin, and when he had\r\nwashed it out his amazement was beyond description. Wide West stock\r\nsoared skywards. It was said that repeated offers had been made for it\r\nat a thousand dollars a foot, and promptly refused. We have all had the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cblues\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the mere sky-blues\xe2\x80\x94but mine were indigo, now\xe2\x80\x94because I did not\r\nown in the Wide West. The world seemed hollow to me, and existence a\r\ngrief. I lost my appetite, and ceased to take an interest in anything.\r\nStill I had to stay, and listen to other people\xe2\x80\x99s rejoicings, because I\r\nhad no money to get out of the camp with.\r\n\r\nThe Wide West company put a stop to the carrying away of \xe2\x80\x9cspecimens,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand well they might, for every handful of the ore was worth a sum of\r\nsome consequence. To show the exceeding value of the ore, I will remark\r\nthat a sixteen-hundred-pounds parcel of it was sold, just as it lay, at\r\nthe mouth of the shaft, at _one dollar a pound_; and the man who bought\r\nit \xe2\x80\x9cpacked\xe2\x80\x9d it on mules a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles, over\r\nthe mountains, to San Francisco, satisfied that it would yield at a rate\r\nthat would richly compensate him for his trouble. The Wide West people\r\nalso commanded their foreman to refuse any but their own operatives\r\npermission to enter the mine at any time or for any purpose. I kept up\r\nmy \xe2\x80\x9cblue\xe2\x80\x9d meditations and Higbie kept up a deal of thinking, too, but of\r\na different sort. He puzzled over the \xe2\x80\x9crock,\xe2\x80\x9d examined it with a glass,\r\ninspected it in different lights and from different points of view, and\r\nafter each experiment delivered himself, in soliloquy, of one and the\r\nsame unvarying opinion in the same unvarying formula:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is _not_ Wide West rock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said once or twice that he meant to have a look into the Wide West\r\nshaft if he got shot for it. I was wretched, and did not care whether he\r\ngot a look into it or not. He failed that day, and tried again at night;\r\nfailed again; got up at dawn and tried, and failed again. Then he lay in\r\nambush in the sage brush hour after hour, waiting for the two or three\r\nhands to adjourn to the shade of a boulder for dinner; made a start\r\nonce, but was premature\xe2\x80\x94one of the men came back for something; tried it\r\nagain, but when almost at the mouth of the shaft, another of the men\r\nrose up from behind the boulder as if to reconnoitre, and he dropped on\r\nthe ground and lay quiet; presently he crawled on his hands and knees to\r\nthe mouth of the shaft, gave a quick glance around, then seized the rope\r\nand slid down the shaft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n279.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe disappeared in the gloom of a \xe2\x80\x9cside drift\xe2\x80\x9d just as a head appeared in\r\nthe mouth of the shaft and somebody shouted \xe2\x80\x9cHello!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which he did not\r\nanswer. He was not disturbed any more. An hour later he entered the\r\ncabin, hot, red, and ready to burst with smothered excitement, and\r\nexclaimed in a stage whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knew it! We are rich! IT\xe2\x80\x99S A BLIND LEAD!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought the very earth reeled under me. Doubt\xe2\x80\x94conviction\xe2\x80\x94doubt\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94exultation\xe2\x80\x94hope, amazement, belief, unbelief\xe2\x80\x94every emotion\r\nimaginable swept in wild procession through my heart and brain, and I\r\ncould not speak a word. After a moment or two of this mental fury, I\r\nshook myself to rights, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay it again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s blind lead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCal. let\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s burn the house\xe2\x80\x94or kill somebody! Let\xe2\x80\x99s get out where\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s room to hurrah! But what is the use? It is a hundred times too\r\ngood to be true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a blind lead, for a million!\xe2\x80\x94hanging wall\xe2\x80\x94foot wall\xe2\x80\x94clay\r\ncasings\xe2\x80\x94everything complete!\xe2\x80\x9d He swung his hat and gave three cheers,\r\nand I cast doubt to the winds and chimed in with a will. For I was worth\r\na million dollars, and did not care \xe2\x80\x9cwhether school kept or not!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n280.jpg (50K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I ought to explain. A \xe2\x80\x9cblind lead\xe2\x80\x9d is a lead or ledge that\r\ndoes not \xe2\x80\x9ccrop out\xe2\x80\x9d above the surface. A miner does not know where to\r\nlook for such leads, but they are often stumbled upon by accident in the\r\ncourse of driving a tunnel or sinking a shaft. Higbie knew the Wide West\r\nrock perfectly well, and the more he had examined the new developments\r\nthe more he was satisfied that the ore could not have come from the Wide\r\nWest vein. And so had it occurred to him alone, of all the camp, that\r\nthere was a blind lead down in the shaft, and that even the Wide West\r\npeople themselves did not suspect it. He was right. When he went down\r\nthe shaft, he found that the blind lead held its independent way through\r\nthe Wide West vein, cutting it diagonally, and that it was enclosed in\r\nits own well-defined casing-rocks and clay. Hence it was public\r\nproperty. Both leads being perfectly well defined, it was easy for any\r\nminer to see which one belonged to the Wide West and which did not.\r\n\r\nWe thought it well to have a strong friend, and therefore we brought the\r\nforeman of the Wide West to our cabin that night and revealed the great\r\nsurprise to him. Higbie said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to take possession of this blind lead, record it and\r\nestablish ownership, and then forbid the Wide West company to take out\r\nany more of the rock. You cannot help your company in this matter\xe2\x80\x94nobody\r\ncan help them. I will go into the shaft with you and prove to your\r\nentire satisfaction that it _is_ a blind lead. Now we propose to take\r\nyou in with us, and claim the blind lead in our three names. What do you\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat could a man say who had an opportunity to simply stretch forth his\r\nhand and take possession of a fortune without risk of any kind and\r\nwithout wronging any one or attaching the least taint of dishonor to his\r\nname? He could only say, \xe2\x80\x9cAgreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe notice was put up that night, and duly spread upon the recorder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbooks before ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock. We claimed two hundred feet each\xe2\x80\x94six hundred\r\nfeet in all\xe2\x80\x94the smallest and compactest organization in the district,\r\nand the easiest to manage.\r\n\r\nNo one can be so thoughtless as to suppose that we slept, that night.\r\nHigbie and I went to bed at midnight, but it was only to lie broad awake\r\nand think, dream, scheme. The floorless, tumble-down cabin was a palace,\r\nthe ragged gray blankets silk, the furniture rosewood and mahogany. Each\r\nnew splendor that burst out of my visions of the future whirled me\r\nbodily over in bed or jerked me to a sitting posture just as if an\r\nelectric battery had been applied to me. We shot fragments of\r\nconversation back and forth at each other. Once Higbie said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you going home\xe2\x80\x94to the States?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with an evolution or two, ending with a sitting position.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94but next month, at furthest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll go in the same steamer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAgreed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteamer of the 10th?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. No, the 1st.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to live?\xe2\x80\x9d said Higbie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSan Francisco.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo high\xe2\x80\x94too much climbing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94from Higbie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of Russian Hill\xe2\x80\x94building a house up there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much climbing? Shan\xe2\x80\x99t you keep a carriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. I forgot that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n282.jpg (70K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCal., what kind of a house are you going to build?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking about that.

By three o\xe2\x80\x99clock we found it was no use, and so we\r\ngot up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise. It was my week\r\nto cook. I always hated cooking\xe2\x80\x94now, I abhorred it.\r\n\r\nThe news was all over town. The former excitement was great\xe2\x80\x94this one was\r\ngreater still. I walked the streets serene and happy. Higbie said the\r\nforeman had been offered two hundred thousand dollars for his third of\r\nthe mine. I said I would like to see myself selling for any such price.\r\nMy ideas were lofty. My figure was a million. Still, I honestly believe\r\nthat if I had been offered it, it would have had no other effect than to\r\nmake me hold off for more.\r\n\r\nI found abundant enjoyment in being rich. A man offered me a three-\r\nhundred-dollar horse, and wanted to take my simple, unendorsed note for\r\nit. That brought the most realizing sense I had yet had that I was\r\nactually rich, beyond shadow of doubt. It was followed by numerous other\r\nevidences of a similar nature\xe2\x80\x94among which I may mention the fact of the\r\nbutcher leaving us a double supply of meat and saying nothing about\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nBy the laws of the district, the \xe2\x80\x9clocators\xe2\x80\x9d or claimants of a ledge were\r\nobliged to do a fair and reasonable amount of work on their new property\r\nwithin ten days after the date of the location, or the property was\r\nforfeited, and anybody could go and seize it that chose. So we\r\ndetermined to go to work the next day. About the middle of the\r\nafternoon, as I was coming out of the post office, I met a Mr. Gardiner,\r\nwho told me that Capt. John Nye was lying dangerously ill at his place\r\n(the \xe2\x80\x9cNine-Mile Ranch\xe2\x80\x9d), and that he and his wife were not able to give\r\nhim nearly as much care and attention as his case demanded. I said if he\r\nwould wait for me a moment, I would go down and help in the sick room. I\r\nran to the cabin to tell Higbie. He was not there, but I left a note on\r\nthe table for him, and a few minutes later I left town in Gardiner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwagon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Nye was very ill indeed, with spasmodic rheumatism. But the old\r\ngentleman was himself\xe2\x80\x94which is to say, he was kind-hearted and agreeable\r\nwhen comfortable, but a singularly violent wild-cat when things did not\r\ngo well. He would be smiling along pleasantly enough, when a sudden\r\nspasm of his disease would take him and he would go out of his smile\r\ninto a perfect fury. He would groan and wail and howl with the anguish,\r\nand fill up the odd chinks with the most elaborate profanity that strong\r\nconvictions and a fine fancy could contrive. With fair opportunity he\r\ncould swear very well and handle his adjectives with considerable\r\njudgment; but when the spasm was on him it was painful to listen to him,\r\nhe was so awkward. However, I had seen him nurse a sick man himself and\r\nput up patiently with the inconveniences of the situation, and\r\nconsequently I was willing that he should have full license now that his\r\nown turn had come. He could not disturb me, with all his raving and\r\nranting, for my mind had work on hand, and it labored on diligently,\r\nnight and day, whether my hands were idle or employed. I was altering\r\nand amending the plans for my house, and thinking over the propriety of\r\nhaving the billard-room in the attic, instead of on the same floor with\r\nthe dining-room; also, I was trying to decide between green and blue for\r\nthe upholstery of the drawing-room, for, although my preference was blue\r\nI feared it was a color that would be too easily damaged by dust and\r\nsunlight; likewise while I was content to put the coachman in a modest\r\nlivery, I was uncertain about a footman\xe2\x80\x94I needed one, and was even\r\nresolved to have one, but wished he could properly appear and perform\r\nhis functions out of livery, for I somewhat dreaded so much show; and\r\nyet, inasmuch as my late grandfather had had a coachman and such things,\r\nbut no liveries, I felt rather drawn to beat him;\xe2\x80\x94or beat his ghost, at\r\nany rate; I was also systematizing the European trip, and managed to get\r\nit all laid out, as to route and length of time to be devoted to\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94everything, with one exception\xe2\x80\x94namely, whether to cross the desert\r\nfrom Cairo to Jerusalem per camel, or go by sea to Beirut, and thence\r\ndown through the country per caravan. Meantime I was writing to the\r\nfriends at home every day, instructing them concerning all my plans and\r\nintentions, and directing them to look up a handsome homestead for my\r\nmother and agree upon a price for it against my coming, and also\r\ndirecting them to sell my share of the Tennessee land and tender the\r\nproceeds to the widows\xe2\x80\x99 and orphans\xe2\x80\x99 fund of the typographical union of\r\nwhich I had long been a member in good standing. [This Tennessee land\r\nhad been in the possession of the family many years, and promised to\r\nconfer high fortune upon us some day; it still promises it, but in a\r\nless violent way.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n287.jpg (69K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had been nursing the Captain nine days he was somewhat better,\r\nbut very feeble. During the afternoon we lifted him into a chair and\r\ngave him an alcoholic vapor bath, and then set about putting him on the\r\nbed again. We had to be exceedingly careful, for the least jar produced\r\npain. Gardiner had his shoulders and I his legs; in an unfortunate\r\nmoment I stumbled and the patient fell heavily on the bed in an agony of\r\ntorture. I never heard a man swear so in my life. He raved like a\r\nmaniac, and tried to snatch a revolver from the table\xe2\x80\x94but I got it. He\r\nordered me out of the house, and swore a world of oaths that he would\r\nkill me wherever he caught me when he got on his feet again. It was\r\nsimply a passing fury, and meant nothing. I knew he would forget it in\r\nan hour, and maybe be sorry for it, too; but it angered me a little, at\r\nthe moment. So much so, indeed, that I determined to go back to\r\nEsmeralda. I thought he was able to get along alone, now, since he was\r\non the war path. I took supper, and as soon as the moon rose, began my\r\nnine-mile journey, on foot.\r\n\r\nEven millionaires needed no horses, in those days, for a mere nine-mile\r\njaunt without baggage.\r\n\r\nAs I \xe2\x80\x9craised the hill\xe2\x80\x9d overlooking the town, it lacked fifteen minutes\r\nof twelve. I glanced at the hill over beyond the canyon, and in the\r\nbright moonlight saw what appeared to be about half the population of\r\nthe village massed on and around the Wide West croppings. My heart gave\r\nan exulting bound, and I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cThey have made a new strike\r\nto-night\xe2\x80\x94and struck it richer than ever, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d I started over\r\nthere, but gave it up. I said the \xe2\x80\x9cstrick\xe2\x80\x9d would keep, and I had climbed\r\nhill enough for one night. I went on down through the town, and as I was\r\npassing a little German bakery, a woman ran out and begged me to come in\r\nand help her. She said her husband had a fit. I went in, and judged she\r\nwas right\xe2\x80\x94he appeared to have a hundred of them, compressed into one.\r\nTwo Germans were there, trying to hold him, and not making much of a\r\nsuccess of it. I ran up the street half a block or so and routed out a\r\nsleeping doctor, brought him down half dressed, and we four wrestled\r\nwith the maniac, and doctored, drenched and bled him, for more than an\r\nhour, and the poor German woman did the crying. He grew quiet, now, and\r\nthe doctor and I withdrew and left him to his friends.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. As I entered the cabin door, tired\r\nbut jolly, the dingy light of a tallow candle revealed Higbie, sitting\r\nby the pine table gazing stupidly at my note, which he held in his\r\nfingers, and looking pale, old, and haggard. I halted, and looked at\r\nhim. He looked at me, stolidly. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHigbie, what\xe2\x80\x94what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re ruined\xe2\x80\x94we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the work\xe2\x80\x94THE BLIND LEAD\xe2\x80\x99S RELOCATED!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n288.jpg (57K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was enough. I sat down sick, grieved\xe2\x80\x94broken-hearted, indeed. A minute\r\nbefore, I was rich and brimful of vanity; I was a pauper now, and very\r\nmeek. We sat still an hour, busy with thought, busy with vain and\r\nuseless self-upbraidings, busy with \xe2\x80\x9cWhy _didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ I do this, and why\r\n_didn\xe2\x80\x99t_ I do that,\xe2\x80\x9d but neither spoke a word. Then we dropped into\r\nmutual explanations, and the mystery was cleared away. It came out that\r\nHigbie had depended on me, as I had on him, and as both of us had on the\r\nforeman. The folly of it! It was the first time that ever staid and\r\nsteadfast Higbie had left an important matter to chance or failed to be\r\ntrue to his full share of a responsibility.\r\n\r\nBut he had never seen my note till this moment, and this moment was the\r\nfirst time he had been in the cabin since the day he had seen me last.\r\nHe, also, had left a note for me, on that same fatal afternoon\xe2\x80\x94had\r\nridden up on horseback, and looked through the window, and being in a\r\nhurry and not seeing me, had tossed the note into the cabin through a\r\nbroken pane. Here it was, on the floor, where it had remained\r\nundisturbed for nine days:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fail to do the work before the ten days expire. W. has passed\r\nthrough and given me notice. I am to join him at Mono Lake, and we shall\r\ngo on from there to-night. He says he will find it this time, sure.\r\nCAL.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cW.\xe2\x80\x9d meant Whiteman, of course. That thrice accursed \xe2\x80\x9ccement!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was the way of it. An old miner, like Higbie, could no more\r\nwithstand the fascination of a mysterious mining excitement like this\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccement\xe2\x80\x9d foolishness, than he could refrain from eating when he was\r\nfamishing. Higbie had been dreaming about the marvelous cement for\r\nmonths; and now, against his better judgment, he had gone off and \xe2\x80\x9ctaken\r\nthe chances\xe2\x80\x9d on my keeping secure a mine worth a million undiscovered\r\ncement veins. They had not been followed this time. His riding out of\r\ntown in broad daylight was such a common-place thing to do that it had\r\nnot attracted any attention. He said they prosecuted their search in the\r\nfastnesses of the mountains during nine days, without success; they\r\ncould not find the cement. Then a ghastly fear came over him that\r\nsomething might have happened to prevent the doing of the necessary work\r\nto hold the blind lead (though indeed he thought such a thing hardly\r\npossible), and forthwith he started home with all speed. He would have\r\nreached Esmeralda in time, but his horse broke down and he had to walk a\r\ngreat part of the distance. And so it happened that as he came into\r\nEsmeralda by one road, I entered it by another. His was the superior\r\nenergy, however, for he went straight to the Wide West, instead of\r\nturning aside as I had done\xe2\x80\x94and he arrived there about five or ten\r\nminutes too late! The \xe2\x80\x9cnotice\xe2\x80\x9d was already up, the \xe2\x80\x9crelocation\xe2\x80\x9d of our\r\nmine completed beyond recall, and the crowd rapidly dispersing. He\r\nlearned some facts before he left the ground. The foreman had not been\r\nseen about the streets since the night we had located the mine\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ntelegram had called him to California on a matter of life and death, it\r\nwas said. At any rate he had done no work and the watchful eyes of the\r\ncommunity were taking note of the fact. At midnight of this woful tenth\r\nday, the ledge would be \xe2\x80\x9crelocatable,\xe2\x80\x9d and by eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the hill\r\nwas black with men prepared to do the relocating. That was the crowd I\r\nhad seen when I fancied a new \xe2\x80\x9cstrike\xe2\x80\x9d had been made\xe2\x80\x94idiot that I was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n290.jpg (141K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[We three had the same right to relocate the lead that other people had,\r\nprovided we were quick enough.] As midnight was announced, fourteen men,\r\nduly armed and ready to back their proceedings, put up their \xe2\x80\x9cnotice\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nand proclaimed their ownership of the blind lead, under the new name of\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cJohnson.\xe2\x80\x9d But A. D. Allen our partner (the foreman) put in a sudden\r\nappearance about that time, with a cocked revolver in his hand, and said\r\nhis name must be added to the list, or he would \xe2\x80\x9cthin out the Johnson\r\ncompany some.\xe2\x80\x9d He was a manly, splendid, determined fellow, and known to\r\nbe as good as his word, and therefore a compromise was effected. They\r\nput in his name for a hundred feet, reserving to themselves the\r\ncustomary two hundred feet each. Such was the history of the night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nevents, as Higbie gathered from a friend on the way home.\r\n\r\nHigbie and I cleared out on a new mining excitement the next morning,\r\nglad to get away from the scene of our sufferings, and after a month or\r\ntwo of hardship and disappointment, returned to Esmeralda once more.\r\nThen we learned that the Wide West and the Johnson companies had\r\nconsolidated; that the stock, thus united, comprised five thousand feet,\r\nor shares; that the foreman, apprehending tiresome litigation, and\r\nconsidering such a huge concern unwieldy, had sold his hundred feet for\r\nninety thousand dollars in gold and gone home to the States to enjoy it.\r\nIf the stock was worth such a gallant figure, with five thousand shares\r\nin the corporation, it makes me dizzy to think what it would have been\r\nworth with only our original six hundred in it. It was the difference\r\nbetween six hundred men owning a house and five thousand owning it. We\r\nwould have been millionaires if we had only worked with pick and spade\r\none little day on our property and so secured our ownership!\r\n\r\nIt reads like a wild fancy sketch, but the evidence of many witnesses,\r\nand likewise that of the official records of Esmeralda District, is\r\neasily obtainable in proof that it is a true history. I can always have\r\nit to say that I was absolutely and unquestionably worth a million\r\ndollars, once, for ten days.\r\n\r\nA year ago my esteemed and in every way estimable old millionaire\r\npartner, Higbie, wrote me from an obscure little mining camp in\r\nCalifornia that after nine or ten years of buffetings and hard striving,\r\nhe was at last in a position where he could command twenty-five hundred\r\ndollars, and said he meant to go into the fruit business in a modest\r\nway. How such a thought would have insulted him the night we lay in our\r\ncabin planning European trips and brown stone houses on Russian Hill!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat to do next?\r\n\r\nIt was a momentous question. I had gone out into the world to shift for\r\nmyself, at the age of thirteen (for my father had endorsed for friends;\r\nand although he left us a sumptuous legacy of pride in his fine\r\nVirginian stock and its national distinction, I presently found that I\r\ncould not live on that alone without occasional bread to wash it down\r\nwith). I had gained a livelihood in various vocations, but had not\r\ndazzled anybody with my successes; still the list was before me, and the\r\namplest liberty in the matter of choosing, provided I wanted to\r\nwork\xe2\x80\x94which I did not, after being so wealthy. I had once been a grocery\r\nclerk, for one day, but had consumed so much sugar in that time that I\r\nwas relieved from further duty by the proprietor; said he wanted me\r\noutside, so that he could have my custom. I had studied law an entire\r\nweek, and then given it up because it was so prosy and tiresome. I had\r\nengaged briefly in the study of blacksmithing, but wasted so much time\r\ntrying to fix the bellows so that it would blow itself, that the master\r\nturned me adrift in disgrace, and told me I would come to no good. I had\r\nbeen a bookseller\xe2\x80\x99s clerk for awhile, but the customers bothered me so\r\nmuch I could not read with any comfort, and so the proprietor gave me a\r\nfurlough and forgot to put a limit to it. I had clerked in a drug store\r\npart of a summer, but my prescriptions were unlucky, and we appeared to\r\nsell more stomach pumps than soda water. So I had to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n293.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI had made of myself a tolerable printer, under the impression that I\r\nwould be another Franklin some day, but somehow had missed the\r\nconnection thus far. There was no berth open in the Esmeralda _Union_,\r\nand besides I had always been such a slow compositor that I looked with\r\nenvy upon the achievements of apprentices of two years\xe2\x80\x99 standing; and\r\nwhen I took a \xe2\x80\x9ctake,\xe2\x80\x9d foremen were in the habit of suggesting that it\r\nwould be wanted \xe2\x80\x9csome time during the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was a good average St. Louis and New Orleans pilot and by no means\r\nashamed of my abilities in that line; wages were two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars a month and no board to pay, and I did long to stand behind a\r\nwheel again and never roam any more\xe2\x80\x94but I had been making such an ass of\r\nmyself lately in grandiloquent letters home about my blind lead and my\r\nEuropean excursion that I did what many and many a poor disappointed\r\nminer had done before; said \xe2\x80\x9cIt is all over with me now, and I will\r\nnever go back home to be pitied\xe2\x80\x94and snubbed.\xe2\x80\x9d I had been a private\r\nsecretary, a silver miner and a silver mill operative, and amounted to\r\nless than nothing in each, and now\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWhat to do next?\r\n\r\nI yielded to Higbie\xe2\x80\x99s appeals and consented to try the mining once more.\r\nWe climbed far up on the mountain side and went to work on a little\r\nrubbishy claim of ours that had a shaft on it eight feet deep. Higbie\r\ndescended into it and worked bravely with his pick till he had loosened\r\nup a deal of rock and dirt and then I went down with a long-handled\r\nshovel (the most awkward invention yet contrived by man) to throw it\r\nout. You must brace the shovel forward with the side of your knee till\r\nit is full, and then, with a skilful toss, throw it backward over your\r\nleft shoulder. I made the toss, and landed the mess just on the edge of\r\nthe shaft and it all came back on my head and down the back of my neck.\r\nI never said a word, but climbed out and walked home. I inwardly\r\nresolved that I would starve before I would make a target of myself and\r\nshoot rubbish at it with a long-handled shovel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n294.jpg (50K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI sat down, in the cabin, and gave myself up to solid misery\xe2\x80\x94so to\r\nspeak. Now in pleasanter days I had amused myself with writing letters\r\nto the chief paper of the Territory, the Virginia Daily Territorial\r\nEnterprise, and had always been surprised when they appeared in print.\r\nMy good opinion of the editors had steadily declined; for it seemed to\r\nme that they might have found something better to fill up with than my\r\nliterature. I had found a letter in the post office as I came home from\r\nthe hill side, and finally I opened it. Eureka! [I never did know what\r\nEureka meant, but it seems to be as proper a word to heave in as any\r\nwhen no other that sounds pretty offers.] It was a deliberate offer to\r\nme of Twenty-Five Dollars a week to come up to Virginia and be city\r\neditor of the Enterprise.\r\n\r\nI would have challenged the publisher in the \xe2\x80\x9cblind lead\xe2\x80\x9d days\xe2\x80\x94I wanted\r\nto fall down and worship him, now. Twenty-Five Dollars a week\xe2\x80\x94it looked\r\nlike bloated luxury\xe2\x80\x94a fortune a sinful and lavish waste of money. But my\r\ntransports cooled when I thought of my inexperience and consequent\r\nunfitness for the position\xe2\x80\x94and straightway, on top of this, my long\r\narray of failures rose up before me. Yet if I refused this place I must\r\npresently become dependent upon somebody for my bread, a thing\r\nnecessarily distasteful to a man who had never experienced such a\r\nhumiliation since he was thirteen years old. Not much to _be_ proud of,\r\nsince it is so common\xe2\x80\x94but then it was all I had to _be_ proud of. So I\r\nwas scared into being a city editor. I would have declined, otherwise.\r\nNecessity is the mother of \xe2\x80\x9ctaking chances.\xe2\x80\x9d I do not doubt that if, at\r\nthat time, I had been offered a salary to translate the Talmud from the\r\noriginal Hebrew, I would have accepted\xe2\x80\x94albeit with diffidence and some\r\nmisgivings\xe2\x80\x94and thrown as much variety into it as I could for the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n295.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI went up to Virginia and entered upon my new vocation. I was a rusty\r\nlooking city editor, I am free to confess\xe2\x80\x94coatless, slouch hat, blue\r\nwoolen shirt, pantaloons stuffed into boot-tops, whiskered half down to\r\nthe waist, and the universal navy revolver slung to my belt. But I\r\nsecured a more Christian costume and discarded the revolver.\r\n\r\nI had never had occasion to kill anybody, nor ever felt a desire to do\r\nso, but had worn the thing in deference to popular sentiment, and in\r\norder that I might not, by its absence, be offensively conspicuous, and\r\na subject of remark. But the other editors, and all the printers,\r\ncarried revolvers. I asked the chief editor and proprietor (Mr. Goodman,\r\nI will call him, since it describes him as well as any name could do)\r\nfor some instructions with regard to my duties, and he told me to go all\r\nover town and ask all sorts of people all sorts of questions, make notes\r\nof the information gained, and write them out for publication. And he\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever say \xe2\x80\x98We learn\xe2\x80\x99 so-and-so, or \xe2\x80\x98It is reported,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\nrumored,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98We understand\xe2\x80\x99 so-and-so, but go to headquarters and get\r\nthe absolute facts, and then speak out and say \xe2\x80\x98It _is_ so-and-so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nOtherwise, people will not put confidence in your news. Unassailable\r\ncertainly is the thing that gives a newspaper the firmest and most\r\nvaluable reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the whole thing in a nut-shell; and to this day when I find a\r\nreporter commencing his article with \xe2\x80\x9cWe understand,\xe2\x80\x9d I gather a\r\nsuspicion that he has not taken as much pains to inform himself as he\r\nought to have done. I moralize well, but I did not always practise well\r\nwhen I was a city editor; I let fancy get the upper hand of fact too\r\noften when there was a dearth of news. I can never forget my first day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexperience as a reporter. I wandered about town questioning everybody,\r\nboring everybody, and finding out that nobody knew anything. At the end\r\nof five hours my notebook was still barren. I spoke to Mr. Goodman. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDan used to make a good thing out of the hay wagons in a dry time when\r\nthere were no fires or inquests. Are there no hay wagons in from the\r\nTruckee? If there are, you might speak of the renewed activity and all\r\nthat sort of thing, in the hay business, you know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n296.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t sensational or exciting, but it fills up and looks business\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI canvassed the city again and found one wretched old hay truck dragging\r\nin from the country. But I made affluent use of it. I multiplied it by\r\nsixteen, brought it into town from sixteen different directions, made\r\nsixteen separate items out of it, and got up such another sweat about\r\nhay as Virginia City had never seen in the world before.\r\n\r\nThis was encouraging. Two nonpareil columns had to be filled, and I was\r\ngetting along. Presently, when things began to look dismal again, a\r\ndesperado killed a man in a saloon and joy returned once more. I never\r\nwas so glad over any mere trifle before in my life. I said to the\r\nmurderer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir, you are a stranger to me, but you have done me a kindness this day\r\nwhich I can never forget. If whole years of gratitude can be to you any\r\nslight compensation, they shall be yours. I was in trouble and you have\r\nrelieved me nobly and at a time when all seemed dark and drear. Count me\r\nyour friend from this time forth, for I am not a man to forget a favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n297.jpg (44K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I did not really say that to him I at least felt a sort of itching\r\ndesire to do it. I wrote up the murder with a hungry attention to\r\ndetails, and when it was finished experienced but one regret\xe2\x80\x94namely,\r\nthat they had not hanged my benefactor on the spot, so that I could work\r\nhim up too.\r\n\r\nNext I discovered some emigrant wagons going into camp on the plaza and\r\nfound that they had lately come through the hostile Indian country and\r\nhad fared rather roughly. I made the best of the item that the\r\ncircumstances permitted, and felt that if I were not confined within\r\nrigid limits by the presence of the reporters of the other papers I\r\ncould add particulars that would make the article much more interesting.\r\nHowever, I found one wagon that was going on to California, and made\r\nsome judicious inquiries of the proprietor. When I learned, through his\r\nshort and surly answers to my cross-questioning, that he was certainly\r\ngoing on and would not be in the city next day to make trouble, I got\r\nahead of the other papers, for I took down his list of names and added\r\nhis party to the killed and wounded. Having more scope here, I put this\r\nwagon through an Indian fight that to this day has no parallel in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nMy two columns were filled. When I read them over in the morning I felt\r\nthat I had found my legitimate occupation at last. I reasoned within\r\nmyself that news, and stirring news, too, was what a paper needed, and I\r\nfelt that I was peculiarly endowed with the ability to furnish it. Mr.\r\nGoodman said that I was as good a reporter as Dan. I desired no higher\r\ncommendation. With encouragement like that, I felt that I could take my\r\npen and murder all the immigrants on the plains if need be and the\r\ninterests of the paper demanded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n298.jpg (22K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, as I grew better acquainted with the business and learned the\r\nrun of the sources of information I ceased to require the aid of fancy\r\nto any large extent, and became able to fill my columns without\r\ndiverging noticeably from the domain of fact.\r\n\r\nI struck up friendships with the reporters of the other journals, and we\r\nswapped \xe2\x80\x9cregulars\xe2\x80\x9d with each other and thus economized work. \xe2\x80\x9cRegulars\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nare permanent sources of news, like courts, bullion returns, \xe2\x80\x9cclean-ups\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nat the quartz mills, and inquests. Inasmuch as everybody went armed, we\r\nhad an inquest about every day, and so this department was naturally set\r\ndown among the \xe2\x80\x9cregulars.\xe2\x80\x9d We had lively papers in those days. My great\r\ncompetitor among the reporters was Boggs of the _Union_. He was an\r\nexcellent reporter. Once in three or four months he would get a little\r\nintoxicated, but as a general thing he was a wary and cautious drinker\r\nalthough always ready to tamper a little with the enemy. He had the\r\nadvantage of me in one thing; he could get the monthly public school\r\nreport and I could not, because the principal hated the _Enterprise_.\r\nOne snowy night when the report was due, I started out sadly wondering\r\nhow I was going to get it. Presently, a few steps up the almost deserted\r\nstreet I stumbled on Boggs and asked him where he was going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the school report.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go along with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, _sir_. I\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust as you say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA saloon-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s boy passed by with a steaming pitcher of hot punch,\r\nand Boggs snuffed the fragrance gratefully. He gazed fondly after the\r\nboy and saw him start up the _Enterprise_ stairs. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could help me get that school business, but since you can\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nI must run up to the _Union_ office and see if I can get them to let me\r\nhave a proof of it after they have set it up, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t begin to\r\nsuppose they will. Good night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold on a minute. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind getting the report and sitting around\r\nwith the boys a little, while you copy it, if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to drop\r\ndown to the principal\xe2\x80\x99s with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you talk like a rational being. Come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe plowed a couple of blocks through the snow, got the report and\r\nreturned to our office. It was a short document and soon copied.\r\nMeantime Boggs helped himself to the punch. I gave the manuscript back\r\nto him and we started out to get an inquest, for we heard pistol shots\r\nnear by. We got the particulars with little loss of time, for it was\r\nonly an inferior sort of bar-room murder, and of little interest to the\r\npublic, and then we separated. Away at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning,\r\nwhen we had gone to press and were having a relaxing concert as\r\nusual\xe2\x80\x94for some of the printers were good singers and others good\r\nperformers on the guitar and on that atrocity the accordion\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nproprietor of the _Union_ strode in and desired to know if anybody had\r\nheard anything of Boggs or the school report. We stated the case, and\r\nall turned out to help hunt for the delinquent. We found him standing on\r\na table in a saloon, with an old tin lantern in one hand and the school\r\nreport in the other, haranguing a gang of intoxicated Cornish miners on\r\nthe iniquity of squandering the public moneys on education \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nhundreds and hundreds of honest hard-working men are literally starving\r\nfor whiskey.\xe2\x80\x9d [Riotous applause.] He had been assisting in a regal spree\r\nwith those parties for hours. We dragged him away and put him to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n301.jpg (93K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course there was no school report in the _Union_, and Boggs held me\r\naccountable, though I was innocent of any intention or desire to compass\r\nits absence from that paper and was as sorry as any one that the\r\nmisfortune had occurred.\r\n\r\nBut we were perfectly friendly. The day that the school report was next\r\ndue, the proprietor of the \xe2\x80\x9cGenessee\xe2\x80\x9d mine furnished us a buggy and\r\nasked us to go down and write something about the property\xe2\x80\x94a very common\r\nrequest and one always gladly acceded to when people furnished buggies,\r\nfor we were as fond of pleasure excursions as other people. In due time\r\nwe arrived at the \xe2\x80\x9cmine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94nothing but a hole in the ground ninety feet\r\ndeep, and no way of getting down into it but by holding on to a rope and\r\nbeing lowered with a windlass. The workmen had just gone off somewhere\r\nto dinner. I was not strong enough to lower Boggs\xe2\x80\x99s bulk; so I took an\r\nunlighted candle in my teeth, made a loop for my foot in the end of the\r\nrope, implored Boggs not to go to sleep or let the windlass get the\r\nstart of him, and then swung out over the shaft. I reached the bottom\r\nmuddy and bruised about the elbows, but safe. I lit the candle, made an\r\nexamination of the rock, selected some specimens and shouted to Boggs to\r\nhoist away. No answer. Presently a head appeared in the circle of\r\ndaylight away aloft, and a voice came down:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all set?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll set\xe2\x80\x94hoist away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you comfortable?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould you wait a little?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh certainly\xe2\x80\x94no particular hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94good by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the school report!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n302.jpg (71K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd he did. I staid down there an hour, and surprised the workmen when\r\nthey hauled up and found a man on the rope instead of a bucket of rock.\r\nI walked home, too\xe2\x80\x94five miles\xe2\x80\x94up hill. We had no school report next\r\nmorning; but the _Union_ had.\r\n\r\nSix months after my entry into journalism the grand \xe2\x80\x9cflush times\xe2\x80\x9d of\r\nSilverland began, and they continued with unabated splendor for three\r\nyears. All difficulty about filling up the \xe2\x80\x9clocal department\xe2\x80\x9d ceased,\r\nand the only trouble now was how to make the lengthened columns hold the\r\nworld of incidents and happenings that came to our literary net every\r\nday. Virginia had grown to be the \xe2\x80\x9clivest\xe2\x80\x9d town, for its age and\r\npopulation, that America had ever produced. The sidewalks swarmed with\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x94to such an extent, indeed, that it was generally no easy matter\r\nto stem the human tide. The streets themselves were just as crowded with\r\nquartz wagons, freight teams and other vehicles. The procession was\r\nendless. So great was the pack, that buggies frequently had to wait half\r\nan hour for an opportunity to cross the principal street. Joy sat on\r\nevery countenance, and there was a glad, almost fierce, intensity in\r\nevery eye, that told of the money-getting schemes that were seething in\r\nevery brain and the high hope that held sway in every heart. Money was\r\nas plenty as dust; every individual considered himself wealthy, and a\r\nmelancholy countenance was nowhere to be seen. There were military\r\ncompanies, fire companies, brass bands, banks, hotels, theatres, \xe2\x80\x9churdy-\r\ngurdy houses,\xe2\x80\x9d wide-open gambling palaces, political pow-wows, civic\r\nprocessions, street fights, murders, inquests, riots, a whiskey mill\r\nevery fifteen steps, a Board of Aldermen, a Mayor, a City Surveyor, a\r\nCity Engineer, a Chief of the Fire Department, with First, Second and\r\nThird Assistants, a Chief of Police, City Marshal and a large police\r\nforce, two Boards of Mining Brokers, a dozen breweries and half a dozen\r\njails and station-houses in full operation, and some talk of building a\r\nchurch. The \xe2\x80\x9cflush times\xe2\x80\x9d were in magnificent flower! Large fire-proof\r\nbrick buildings were going up in the principal streets, and the wooden\r\nsuburbs were spreading out in all directions. Town lots soared up to\r\nprices that were amazing.\r\n\r\nThe great \xe2\x80\x9cComstock lode\xe2\x80\x9d stretched its opulent length straight through\r\nthe town from north to south, and every mine on it was in diligent\r\nprocess of development. One of these mines alone employed six hundred\r\nand seventy-five men, and in the matter of elections the adage was, \xe2\x80\x9cas\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Gould and Curry\xe2\x80\x99 goes, so goes the city.\xe2\x80\x9d Laboring men\xe2\x80\x99s wages were\r\nfour and six dollars a day, and they worked in three \xe2\x80\x9cshifts\xe2\x80\x9d or gangs,\r\nand the blasting and picking and shoveling went on without ceasing,\r\nnight and day.\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ccity\xe2\x80\x9d of Virginia roosted royally midway up the steep side of Mount\r\nDavidson, seven thousand two hundred feet above the level of the sea,\r\nand in the clear Nevada atmosphere was visible from a distance of fifty\r\nmiles! It claimed a population of fifteen thousand to eighteen thousand,\r\nand all day long half of this little army swarmed the streets like bees\r\nand the other half swarmed among the drifts and tunnels of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComstock,\xe2\x80\x9d hundreds of feet down in the earth directly under those same\r\nstreets. Often we felt our chairs jar, and heard the faint boom of a\r\nblast down in the bowels of the earth under the office.\r\n\r\nThe mountain side was so steep that the entire town had a slant to it\r\nlike a roof. Each street was a terrace, and from each to the next street\r\nbelow the descent was forty or fifty feet. The fronts of the houses were\r\nlevel with the street they faced, but their rear first floors were\r\npropped on lofty stilts; a man could stand at a rear first floor window\r\nof a C street house and look down the chimneys of the row of houses\r\nbelow him facing D street. It was a laborious climb, in that thin\r\natmosphere, to ascend from D to A street, and you were panting and out\r\nof breath when you got there; but you could turn around and go down\r\nagain like a house a-fire\xe2\x80\x94so to speak. The atmosphere was so rarified,\r\non account of the great altitude, that one\xe2\x80\x99s blood lay near the surface\r\nalways, and the scratch of a pin was a disaster worth worrying about,\r\nfor the chances were that a grievous erysipelas would ensue. But to\r\noffset this, the thin atmosphere seemed to carry healing to gunshot\r\nwounds, and therefore, to simply shoot your adversary through both lungs\r\nwas a thing not likely to afford you any permanent satisfaction, for he\r\nwould be nearly certain to be around looking for you within the month,\r\nand not with an opera glass, either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n304.jpg (102K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s airy situation one could look over a vast, far-reaching\r\npanorama of mountain ranges and deserts; and whether the day was bright\r\nor overcast, whether the sun was rising or setting, or flaming in the\r\nzenith, or whether night and the moon held sway, the spectacle was\r\nalways impressive and beautiful. Over your head Mount Davidson lifted\r\nits gray dome, and before and below you a rugged canyon clove the\r\nbattlemented hills, making a sombre gateway through which a soft-tinted\r\ndesert was glimpsed, with the silver thread of a river winding through\r\nit, bordered with trees which many miles of distance diminished to a\r\ndelicate fringe; and still further away the snowy mountains rose up and\r\nstretched their long barrier to the filmy horizon\xe2\x80\x94far enough beyond a\r\nlake that burned in the desert like a fallen sun, though that, itself,\r\nlay fifty miles removed. Look from your window where you would, there\r\nwas fascination in the picture. At rare intervals\xe2\x80\x94but very rare\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nwere clouds in our skies, and then the setting sun would gild and flush\r\nand glorify this mighty expanse of scenery with a bewildering pomp of\r\ncolor that held the eye like a spell and moved the spirit like music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy salary was increased to forty dollars a week. But I seldom drew it. I\r\nhad plenty of other resources, and what were two broad twenty-dollar\r\ngold pieces to a man who had his pockets full of such and a cumbersome\r\nabundance of bright half dollars besides? [Paper money has never come\r\ninto use on the Pacific coast.] Reporting was lucrative, and every man\r\nin the town was lavish with his money and his \xe2\x80\x9cfeet.\xe2\x80\x9d The city and all\r\nthe great mountain side were riddled with mining shafts. There were more\r\nmines than miners. True, not ten of these mines were yielding rock worth\r\nhauling to a mill, but everybody said, \xe2\x80\x9cWait till the shaft gets down\r\nwhere the ledge comes in solid, and then you will see!\xe2\x80\x9d So nobody was\r\ndiscouraged. These were nearly all \xe2\x80\x9cwild cat\xe2\x80\x9d mines, and wholly\r\nworthless, but nobody believed it then. The \xe2\x80\x9cOphir,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cGould &\r\nCurry,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cMexican,\xe2\x80\x9d and other great mines on the Comstock lead in\r\nVirginia and Gold Hill were turning out huge piles of rich rock every\r\nday, and every man believed that his little wild cat claim was as good\r\nas any on the \xe2\x80\x9cmain lead\xe2\x80\x9d and would infallibly be worth a thousand\r\ndollars a foot when he \xe2\x80\x9cgot down where it came in solid.\xe2\x80\x9d Poor fellow,\r\nhe was blessedly blind to the fact that he never would see that day. So\r\nthe thousand wild cat shafts burrowed deeper and deeper into the earth\r\nday by day, and all men were beside themselves with hope and happiness.\r\nHow they labored, prophesied, exulted! Surely nothing like it was ever\r\nseen before since the world began. Every one of these wild cat mines\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nmines, but holes in the ground over imaginary mines\xe2\x80\x94was incorporated and\r\nhad handsomely engraved \xe2\x80\x9cstock\xe2\x80\x9d and the stock was salable, too. It was\r\nbought and sold with a feverish avidity in the boards every day. You\r\ncould go up on the mountain side, scratch around and find a ledge (there\r\nwas no lack of them), put up a \xe2\x80\x9cnotice\xe2\x80\x9d with a grandiloquent name in it,\r\nstart a shaft, get your stock printed, and with nothing whatever to\r\nprove that your mine was worth a straw, you could put your stock on the\r\nmarket and sell out for hundreds and even thousands of dollars. To make\r\nmoney, and make it fast, was as easy as it was to eat your dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n307.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery man owned \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d in fifty different wild cat mines and considered\r\nhis fortune made. Think of a city with not one solitary poor man in it!\r\nOne would suppose that when month after month went by and still not a\r\nwild cat mine (by wild cat I mean, in general terms, _any_ claim not\r\nlocated on the mother vein, i.e., the \xe2\x80\x9cComstock\xe2\x80\x9d) yielded a ton of rock\r\nworth crushing, the people would begin to wonder if they were not\r\nputting too much faith in their prospective riches; but there was not a\r\nthought of such a thing. They burrowed away, bought and sold, and were\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nNew claims were taken up daily, and it was the friendly custom to run\r\nstraight to the newspaper offices, give the reporter forty or fifty\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfeet,\xe2\x80\x9d and get them to go and examine the mine and publish a notice of\r\nit. They did not care a fig what you said about the property so you said\r\nsomething. Consequently we generally said a word or two to the effect\r\nthat the \xe2\x80\x9cindications\xe2\x80\x9d were good, or that the ledge was \xe2\x80\x9csix feet wide,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor that the rock \xe2\x80\x9cresembled the Comstock\xe2\x80\x9d (and so it did\xe2\x80\x94but as a\r\ngeneral thing the resemblance was not startling enough to knock you\r\ndown). If the rock was moderately promising, we followed the custom of\r\nthe country, used strong adjectives and frothed at the mouth as if a\r\nvery marvel in silver discoveries had transpired. If the mine was a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdeveloped\xe2\x80\x9d one, and had no pay ore to show (and of course it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t),\r\nwe praised the tunnel; said it was one of the most infatuating tunnels\r\nin the land; driveled and driveled about the tunnel till we ran entirely\r\nout of ecstasies\xe2\x80\x94but never said a word about the rock. We would squander\r\nhalf a column of adulation on a shaft, or a new wire rope, or a dressed\r\npine windlass, or a fascinating force pump, and close with a burst of\r\nadmiration of the \xe2\x80\x9cgentlemanly and efficient Superintendent\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nmine\xe2\x80\x94but never utter a whisper about the rock. And those people were\r\nalways pleased, always satisfied. Occasionally we patched up and\r\nvarnished our reputation for discrimination and stern, undeviating\r\naccuracy, by giving some old abandoned claim a blast that ought to have\r\nmade its dry bones rattle\xe2\x80\x94and then somebody would seize it and sell it\r\non the fleeting notoriety thus conferred upon it.\r\n\r\nThere was _nothing_ in the shape of a mining claim that was not salable.\r\nWe received presents of \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d every day. If we needed a hundred dollars\r\nor so, we sold some; if not, we hoarded it away, satisfied that it would\r\nultimately be worth a thousand dollars a foot. I had a trunk about half\r\nfull of \xe2\x80\x9cstock.\xe2\x80\x9d When a claim made a stir in the market and went up to a\r\nhigh figure, I searched through my pile to see if I had any of its\r\nstock\xe2\x80\x94and generally found it.\r\n\r\nThe prices rose and fell constantly; but still a fall disturbed us\r\nlittle, because a thousand dollars a foot was our figure, and so we were\r\ncontent to let it fluctuate as much as it pleased till it reached it. My\r\npile of stock was not all given to me by people who wished their claims\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnoticed.\xe2\x80\x9d At least half of it was given me by persons who had no\r\nthought of such a thing, and looked for nothing more than a simple\r\nverbal \xe2\x80\x9cthank you;\xe2\x80\x9d and you were not even obliged by law to furnish\r\nthat. If you are coming up the street with a couple of baskets of apples\r\nin your hands, and you meet a friend, you naturally invite him to take a\r\nfew. That describes the condition of things in Virginia in the \xe2\x80\x9cflush\r\ntimes.\xe2\x80\x9d Every man had his pockets full of stock, and it was the actual\r\n_custom_ of the country to part with small quantities of it to friends\r\nwithout the asking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n309.jpg (41K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery often it was a good idea to close the transaction instantly, when a\r\nman offered a stock present to a friend, for the offer was only good and\r\nbinding at that moment, and if the price went to a high figure shortly\r\nafterward the procrastination was a thing to be regretted. Mr. Stewart\r\n(Senator, now, from Nevada) one day told me he would give me twenty feet\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cJustis\xe2\x80\x9d stock if I would walk over to his office. It was worth five\r\nor ten dollars a foot. I asked him to make the offer good for next day,\r\nas I was just going to dinner. He said he would not be in town; so I\r\nrisked it and took my dinner instead of the stock. Within the week the\r\nprice went up to seventy dollars and afterward to a hundred and fifty,\r\nbut nothing could make that man yield. I suppose he sold that stock of\r\nmine and placed the guilty proceeds in his own pocket. [My revenge will\r\nbe found in the accompanying portrait.] I met three friends one\r\nafternoon, who said they had been buying \xe2\x80\x9cOverman\xe2\x80\x9d stock at auction at\r\neight dollars a foot. One said if I would come up to his office he would\r\ngive me fifteen feet; another said he would add fifteen; the third said\r\nhe would do the same. But I was going after an inquest and could not\r\nstop. A few weeks afterward they sold all their \xe2\x80\x9cOverman\xe2\x80\x9d at six hundred\r\ndollars a foot and generously came around to tell me about it\xe2\x80\x94and also\r\nto urge me to accept of the next forty-five feet of it that people tried\r\nto force on me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n310.jpg (27K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are actual facts, and I could make the list a long one and still\r\nconfine myself strictly to the truth. Many a time friends gave us as\r\nmuch as twenty-five feet of stock that was selling at twenty-five\r\ndollars a foot, and they thought no more of it than they would of\r\noffering a guest a cigar. These were \xe2\x80\x9cflush times\xe2\x80\x9d indeed! I thought\r\nthey were going to last always, but somehow I never was much of a\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\nTo show what a wild spirit possessed the mining brain of the community,\r\nI will remark that \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d were actually \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d in excavations for\r\ncellars, where the pick had exposed what seemed to be quartz veins\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nnot cellars in the suburbs, either, but in the very heart of the city;\r\nand forthwith stock would be issued and thrown on the market. It was\r\nsmall matter who the cellar belonged to\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cledge\xe2\x80\x9d belonged to the\r\nfinder, and unless the United States government interfered (inasmuch as\r\nthe government holds the primary right to mines of the noble metals in\r\nNevada\xe2\x80\x94or at least did then), it was considered to be his privilege to\r\nwork it. Imagine a stranger staking out a mining claim among the costly\r\nshrubbery in your front yard and calmly proceeding to lay waste the\r\nground with pick and shovel and blasting powder! It has been often done\r\nin California. In the middle of one of the principal business streets of\r\nVirginia, a man \xe2\x80\x9clocated\xe2\x80\x9d a mining claim and began a shaft on it. He\r\ngave me a hundred feet of the stock and I sold it for a fine suit of\r\nclothes because I was afraid somebody would fall down the shaft and sue\r\nfor damages. I owned in another claim that was located in the middle of\r\nanother street; and to show how absurd people can be, that \xe2\x80\x9cEast India\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nstock (as it was called) sold briskly although there was an ancient\r\ntunnel running directly under the claim and any man could go into it and\r\nsee that it did not cut a quartz ledge or anything that remotely\r\nresembled one.\r\n\r\nOne plan of acquiring sudden wealth was to \xe2\x80\x9csalt\xe2\x80\x9d a wild cat claim and\r\nsell out while the excitement was up. The process was simple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n311.jpg (69K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe schemer located a worthless ledge, sunk a shaft on it, bought a\r\nwagon load of rich \xe2\x80\x9cComstock\xe2\x80\x9d ore, dumped a portion of it into the shaft\r\nand piled the rest by its side, above ground. Then he showed the\r\nproperty to a simpleton and sold it to him at a high figure. Of course\r\nthe wagon load of rich ore was all that the victim ever got out of his\r\npurchase. A most remarkable case of \xe2\x80\x9csalting\xe2\x80\x9d was that of the \xe2\x80\x9cNorth\r\nOphir.\xe2\x80\x9d It was claimed that this vein was a \xe2\x80\x9cremote extension\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\noriginal \xe2\x80\x9cOphir,\xe2\x80\x9d a valuable mine on the \xe2\x80\x9cComstock.\xe2\x80\x9d For a few days\r\neverybody was talking about the rich developments in the North Ophir. It\r\nwas said that it yielded perfectly pure silver in small, solid lumps. I\r\nwent to the place with the owners, and found a shaft six or eight feet\r\ndeep, in the bottom of which was a badly shattered vein of dull,\r\nyellowish, unpromising rock. One would as soon expect to find silver in\r\na grindstone. We got out a pan of the rubbish and washed it in a puddle,\r\nand sure enough, among the sediment we found half a dozen black, bullet-\r\nlooking pellets of unimpeachable \xe2\x80\x9cnative\xe2\x80\x9d silver. Nobody had ever heard\r\nof such a thing before; science could not account for such a queer\r\nnovelty. The stock rose to sixty-five dollars a foot, and at this figure\r\nthe world-renowned tragedian, McKean Buchanan, bought a commanding\r\ninterest and prepared to quit the stage once more\xe2\x80\x94he was always doing\r\nthat. And then it transpired that the mine had been \xe2\x80\x9csalted\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and not in\r\nany hackneyed way, either, but in a singularly bold, barefaced and\r\npeculiarly original and outrageous fashion. On one of the lumps of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnative\xe2\x80\x9d silver was discovered the minted legend, \xe2\x80\x9cTED STATES OF,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen it was plainly apparent that the mine had been \xe2\x80\x9csalted\xe2\x80\x9d with melted\r\nhalf-dollars! The lumps thus obtained had been blackened till they\r\nresembled native silver, and were then mixed with the shattered rock in\r\nthe bottom of the shaft. It is literally true. Of course the price of\r\nthe stock at once fell to nothing, and the tragedian was ruined. But for\r\nthis calamity we might have lost McKean Buchanan from the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cflush times\xe2\x80\x9d held bravely on. Something over two years before, Mr.\r\nGoodman and another journeyman printer, had borrowed forty dollars and\r\nset out from San Francisco to try their fortunes in the new city of\r\nVirginia. They found the _Territorial Enterprise_, a poverty-stricken\r\nweekly journal, gasping for breath and likely to die. They bought it,\r\ntype, fixtures, good-will and all, for a thousand dollars, on long time.\r\nThe editorial sanctum, news-room, press-room, publication office, bed-\r\nchamber, parlor, and kitchen were all compressed into one apartment and\r\nit was a small one, too. The editors and printers slept on the floor, a\r\nChinaman did their cooking, and the \xe2\x80\x9cimposing-stone\xe2\x80\x9d was the general\r\ndinner table. But now things were changed. The paper was a great daily,\r\nprinted by steam; there were five editors and twenty-three compositors;\r\nthe subscription price was sixteen dollars a year; the advertising rates\r\nwere exorbitant, and the columns crowded. The paper was clearing from\r\nsix to ten thousand dollars a month, and the \xe2\x80\x9cEnterprise Building\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\nfinished and ready for occupation\xe2\x80\x94a stately fireproof brick. Every day\r\nfrom five all the way up to eleven columns of \xe2\x80\x9clive\xe2\x80\x9d advertisements were\r\nleft out or crowded into spasmodic and irregular \xe2\x80\x9csupplements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cGould & Curry\xe2\x80\x9d company were erecting a monster hundred-stamp mill\r\nat a cost that ultimately fell little short of a million dollars. Gould\r\n& Curry stock paid heavy dividends\xe2\x80\x94a rare thing, and an experience\r\nconfined to the dozen or fifteen claims located on the \xe2\x80\x9cmain lead,\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cComstock.\xe2\x80\x9d The Superintendent of the Gould & Curry lived, rent free, in\r\na fine house built and furnished by the company. He drove a fine pair of\r\nhorses which were a present from the company, and his salary was twelve\r\nthousand dollars a year. The superintendent of another of the great\r\nmines traveled in grand state, had a salary of twenty-eight thousand\r\ndollars a year, and in a law suit in after days claimed that he was to\r\nhave had one per cent. on the gross yield of the bullion likewise.\r\n\r\nMoney was wonderfully plenty. The trouble was, not how to get it,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nhow to spend it, how to lavish it, get rid of it, squander it. And so it\r\nwas a happy thing that just at this juncture the news came over the\r\nwires that a great United States Sanitary Commission had been formed and\r\nmoney was wanted for the relief of the wounded sailors and soldiers of\r\nthe Union languishing in the Eastern hospitals. Right on the heels of it\r\ncame word that San Francisco had responded superbly before the telegram\r\nwas half a day old. Virginia rose as one man! A Sanitary Committee was\r\nhurriedly organized, and its chairman mounted a vacant cart in C street\r\nand tried to make the clamorous multitude understand that the rest of\r\nthe committee were flying hither and thither and working with all their\r\nmight and main, and that if the town would only wait an hour, an office\r\nwould be ready, books opened, and the Commission prepared to receive\r\ncontributions. His voice was drowned and his information lost in a\r\nceaseless roar of cheers, and demands that the money be received\r\n_now_\xe2\x80\x94they swore they would not wait. The chairman pleaded and argued,\r\nbut, deaf to all entreaty, men plowed their way through the throng and\r\nrained checks of gold coin into the cart and skurried away for more.\r\nHands clutching money, were thrust aloft out of the jam by men who hoped\r\nthis eloquent appeal would cleave a road their strugglings could not\r\nopen. The very Chinamen and Indians caught the excitement and dashed\r\ntheir half dollars into the cart without knowing or caring what it was\r\nall about. Women plunged into the crowd, trimly attired, fought their\r\nway to the cart with their coin, and emerged again, by and by, with\r\ntheir apparel in a state of hopeless dilapidation. It was the wildest\r\nmob Virginia had ever seen and the most determined and ungovernable; and\r\nwhen at last it abated its fury and dispersed, it had not a penny in its\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n315.jpg (125K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use its own phraseology, it came there \xe2\x80\x9cflush\xe2\x80\x9d and went away\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbusted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter that, the Commission got itself into systematic working order, and\r\nfor weeks the contributions flowed into its treasury in a generous\r\nstream. Individuals and all sorts of organizations levied upon\r\nthemselves a regular weekly tax for the sanitary fund, graduated\r\naccording to their means, and there was not another grand universal\r\noutburst till the famous \xe2\x80\x9cSanitary Flour Sack\xe2\x80\x9d came our way. Its history\r\nis peculiar and interesting. A former schoolmate of mine, by the name of\r\nReuel Gridley, was living at the little city of Austin, in the Reese\r\nriver country, at this time, and was the Democratic candidate for mayor.\r\nHe and the Republican candidate made an agreement that the defeated man\r\nshould be publicly presented with a fifty-pound sack of flour by the\r\nsuccessful one, and should carry it home on his shoulder. Gridley was\r\ndefeated. The new mayor gave him the sack of flour, and he shouldered it\r\nand carried it a mile or two, from Lower Austin to his home in Upper\r\nAustin, attended by a band of music and the whole population. Arrived\r\nthere, he said he did not need the flour, and asked what the people\r\nthought he had better do with it. A voice said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell it to the highest bidder, for the benefit of the Sanitary fund.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was greeted with a round of applause, and Gridley mounted\r\na dry-goods box and assumed the role of auctioneer. The bids went higher\r\nand higher, as the sympathies of the pioneers awoke and expanded, till\r\nat last the sack was knocked down to a mill man at two hundred and fifty\r\ndollars, and his check taken. He was asked where he would have the flour\r\ndelivered, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNowhere\xe2\x80\x94sell it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow the cheers went up royally, and the multitude were fairly in the\r\nspirit of the thing. So Gridley stood there and shouted and perspired\r\ntill the sun went down; and when the crowd dispersed he had sold the\r\nsack to three hundred different people, and had taken in eight thousand\r\ndollars in gold. And still the flour sack was in his possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n317.jpg (157K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news came to Virginia, and a telegram went back:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch along your flour sack!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThirty-six hours afterward Gridley arrived, and an afternoon mass\r\nmeeting was held in the Opera House, and the auction began. But the sack\r\nhad come sooner than it was expected; the people were not thoroughly\r\naroused, and the sale dragged. At nightfall only five thousand dollars\r\nhad been secured, and there was a crestfallen feeling in the community.\r\nHowever, there was no disposition to let the matter rest here and\r\nacknowledge vanquishment at the hands of the village of Austin. Till\r\nlate in the night the principal citizens were at work arranging the\r\nmorrow\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, and when they went to bed they had no fears for the\r\nresult. At eleven the next morning a procession of open carriages,\r\nattended by clamorous bands of music and adorned with a moving display\r\nof flags, filed along C street and was soon in danger of blockade by a\r\nhuzzaing multitude of citizens. In the first carriage sat Gridley, with\r\nthe flour sack in prominent view, the latter splendid with bright paint\r\nand gilt lettering; also in the same carriage sat the mayor and the\r\nrecorder. The other carriages contained the Common Council, the editors\r\nand reporters, and other people of imposing consequence. The crowd\r\npressed to the corner of C and Taylor streets, expecting the sale to\r\nbegin there, but they were disappointed, and also unspeakably surprised;\r\nfor the cavalcade moved on as if Virginia had ceased to be of\r\nimportance, and took its way over the \xe2\x80\x9cdivide,\xe2\x80\x9d toward the small town of\r\nGold Hill. Telegrams had gone ahead to Gold Hill, Silver City and\r\nDayton, and those communities were at fever heat and rife for the\r\nconflict. It was a very hot day, and wonderfully dusty. At the end of a\r\nshort half hour we descended into Gold Hill with drums beating and\r\ncolors flying, and enveloped in imposing clouds of dust. The whole\r\npopulation\xe2\x80\x94men, women and children, Chinamen and Indians, were massed in\r\nthe main street, all the flags in town were at the mast head, and the\r\nblare of the bands was drowned in cheers. Gridley stood up and asked who\r\nwould make the first bid for the National Sanitary Flour Sack. Gen. W.\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Yellow Jacket silver mining company offers a thousand dollars,\r\ncoin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA tempest of applause followed. A telegram carried the news to Virginia,\r\nand fifteen minutes afterward that city\xe2\x80\x99s population was massed in the\r\nstreets devouring the tidings\xe2\x80\x94for it was part of the programme that the\r\nbulletin boards should do a good work that day. Every few minutes a new\r\ndispatch was bulletined from Gold Hill, and still the excitement grew.\r\nTelegrams began to return to us from Virginia beseeching Gridley to\r\nbring back the flour sack; but such was not the plan of the campaign. At\r\nthe end of an hour Gold Hill\xe2\x80\x99s small population had paid a figure for\r\nthe flour sack that awoke all the enthusiasm of Virginia when the grand\r\ntotal was displayed upon the bulletin boards. Then the Gridley cavalcade\r\nmoved on, a giant refreshed with new lager beer and plenty of it\xe2\x80\x94for the\r\npeople brought it to the carriages without waiting to measure it\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwithin three hours more the expedition had carried Silver City and\r\nDayton by storm and was on its way back covered with glory. Every move\r\nhad been telegraphed and bulletined, and as the procession entered\r\nVirginia and filed down C street at half past eight in the evening the\r\ntown was abroad in the thoroughfares, torches were glaring, flags\r\nflying, bands playing, cheer on cheer cleaving the air, and the city\r\nready to surrender at discretion. The auction began, every bid was\r\ngreeted with bursts of applause, and at the end of two hours and a half\r\na population of fifteen thousand souls had paid in coin for a fifty-\r\npound sack of flour a sum equal to forty thousand dollars in greenbacks!\r\nIt was at a rate in the neighborhood of three dollars for each man,\r\nwoman and child of the population. The grand total would have been twice\r\nas large, but the streets were very narrow, and hundreds who wanted to\r\nbid could not get within a block of the stand, and could not make\r\nthemselves heard. These grew tired of waiting and many of them went home\r\nlong before the auction was over. This was the greatest day Virginia\r\never saw, perhaps.\r\n\r\nGridley sold the sack in Carson city and several California towns; also\r\nin San Francisco. Then he took it east and sold it in one or two\r\nAtlantic cities, I think. I am not sure of that, but I know that he\r\nfinally carried it to St. Louis, where a monster Sanitary Fair was being\r\nheld, and after selling it there for a large sum and helping on the\r\nenthusiasm by displaying the portly silver bricks which Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndonation had produced, he had the flour baked up into small cakes and\r\nretailed them at high prices.\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that when the flour sack\xe2\x80\x99s mission was ended it had\r\nbeen sold for a grand total of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in\r\ngreenbacks! This is probably the only instance on record where common\r\nfamily flour brought three thousand dollars a pound in the public\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Mr. Gridley\xe2\x80\x99s memory to mention that the expenses of his\r\nsanitary flour sack expedition of fifteen thousand miles, going and\r\nreturning, were paid in large part if not entirely, out of his own\r\npocket. The time he gave to it was not less than three months. Mr.\r\nGridley was a soldier in the Mexican war and a pioneer Californian. He\r\ndied at Stockton, California, in December, 1870, greatly regretted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n319.jpg (51K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were nabobs in those days\xe2\x80\x94in the \xe2\x80\x9cflush times,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean. Every rich\r\nstrike in the mines created one or two. I call to mind several of these.\r\nThey were careless, easy-going fellows, as a general thing, and the\r\ncommunity at large was as much benefited by their riches as they were\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94possibly more, in some cases.\r\n\r\nTwo cousins, teamsters, did some hauling for a man and had to take a\r\nsmall segregated portion of a silver mine in lieu of $300 cash. They\r\ngave an outsider a third to open the mine, and they went on teaming. But\r\nnot long. Ten months afterward the mine was out of debt and paying each\r\nowner $8,000 to $10,000 a month\xe2\x80\x94say $100,000 a year.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest nabobs that Nevada was delivered of wore $6,000\r\nworth of diamonds in his bosom, and swore he was unhappy because he\r\ncould not spend his money as fast as he made it.\r\n\r\nAnother Nevada nabob boasted an income that often reached $16,000 a\r\nmonth; and he used to love to tell how he had worked in the very mine\r\nthat yielded it, for five dollars a day, when he first came to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n321.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silver and sage-brush State has knowledge of another of these pets\r\nof fortune\xe2\x80\x94lifted from actual poverty to affluence almost in a single\r\nnight\xe2\x80\x94who was able to offer $100,000 for a position of high official\r\ndistinction, shortly afterward, and did offer it\xe2\x80\x94but failed to get it,\r\nhis politics not being as sound as his bank account.\r\n\r\nThen there was John Smith. He was a good, honest, kind-hearted soul,\r\nborn and reared in the lower ranks of life, and miraculously ignorant.\r\nHe drove a team, and owned a small ranch\xe2\x80\x94a ranch that paid him a\r\ncomfortable living, for although it yielded but little hay, what little\r\nit did yield was worth from $250 to $300 in gold per ton in the market.\r\nPresently Smith traded a few acres of the ranch for a small undeveloped\r\nsilver mine in Gold Hill. He opened the mine and built a little\r\nunpretending ten-stamp mill. Eighteen months afterward he retired from\r\nthe hay business, for his mining income had reached a most comfortable\r\nfigure. Some people said it was $30,000 a month, and others said it was\r\n$60,000. Smith was very rich at any rate.\r\n\r\nAnd then he went to Europe and traveled. And when he came back he was\r\nnever tired of telling about the fine hogs he had seen in England, and\r\nthe gorgeous sheep he had seen in Spain, and the fine cattle he had\r\nnoticed in the vicinity of Rome. He was full of wonders of the old\r\nworld, and advised everybody to travel. He said a man never imagined\r\nwhat surprising things there were in the world till he had traveled.\r\n\r\nOne day, on board ship, the passengers made up a pool of $500, which was\r\nto be the property of the man who should come nearest to guessing the\r\nrun of the vessel for the next twenty-four hours. Next day, toward noon,\r\nthe figures were all in the purser\xe2\x80\x99s hands in sealed envelopes. Smith\r\nwas serene and happy, for he had been bribing the engineer. But another\r\nparty won the prize! Smith said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, that won\xe2\x80\x99t do! He guessed two miles wider of the mark than I\r\ndid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe purser said, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Smith, you missed it further than any man on\r\nboard. We traveled two hundred and eight miles yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Smith, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just where I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you, for I guessed\r\ntwo hundred and nine. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll look at my figgers again you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a 2\r\nand two 0\xe2\x80\x99s, which stands for 200, don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x94and after \xe2\x80\x99em you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a\r\n9 (2009), which stands for two hundred and nine. I reckon I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that\r\nmoney, if you please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Gould & Curry claim comprised twelve hundred feet, and it all\r\nbelonged originally to the two men whose names it bears. Mr. Curry owned\r\ntwo thirds of it\xe2\x80\x94and he said that he sold it out for twenty-five hundred\r\ndollars in cash, and an old plug horse that ate up his market value in\r\nhay and barley in seventeen days by the watch. And he said that Gould\r\nsold out for a pair of second-hand government blankets and a bottle of\r\nwhisky that killed nine men in three hours, and that an unoffending\r\nstranger that smelt the cork was disabled for life. Four years afterward\r\nthe mine thus disposed of was worth in the San Francisco market seven\r\nmillions six hundred thousand dollars in gold coin.\r\n\r\nIn the early days a poverty-stricken Mexican who lived in a canyon\r\ndirectly back of Virginia City, had a stream of water as large as a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s wrist trickling from the hill-side on his premises. The Ophir\r\nCompany segregated a hundred feet of their mine and traded it to him for\r\nthe stream of water. The hundred feet proved to be the richest part of\r\nthe entire mine; four years after the swap, its market value (including\r\nits mill) was $1,500,000.\r\n\r\nAn individual who owned twenty feet in the Ophir mine before its great\r\nriches were revealed to men, traded it for a horse, and a very sorry\r\nlooking brute he was, too. A year or so afterward, when Ophir stock went\r\nup to $3,000 a foot, this man, who had not a cent, used to say he was\r\nthe most startling example of magnificence and misery the world had ever\r\nseen\xe2\x80\x94because he was able to ride a sixty-thousand-dollar horse\xe2\x80\x94yet could\r\nnot scrape up cash enough to buy a saddle, and was obliged to borrow one\r\nor ride bareback. He said if fortune were to give him another sixty-\r\nthousand-dollar horse it would ruin him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n323.jpg (46K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA youth of nineteen, who was a telegraph operator in Virginia on a\r\nsalary of a hundred dollars a month, and who, when he could not make out\r\nGerman names in the list of San Francisco steamer arrivals, used to\r\ningeniously select and supply substitutes for them out of an old Berlin\r\ncity directory, made himself rich by watching the mining telegrams that\r\npassed through his hands and buying and selling stocks accordingly,\r\nthrough a friend in San Francisco. Once when a private dispatch was sent\r\nfrom Virginia announcing a rich strike in a prominent mine and advising\r\nthat the matter be kept secret till a large amount of the stock could be\r\nsecured, he bought forty \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d of the stock at twenty dollars a foot,\r\nand afterward sold half of it at eight hundred dollars a foot and the\r\nrest at double that figure. Within three months he was worth $150,000,\r\nand had resigned his telegraphic position.\r\n\r\nAnother telegraph operator who had been discharged by the company for\r\ndivulging the secrets of the office, agreed with a moneyed man in San\r\nFrancisco to furnish him the result of a great Virginia mining lawsuit\r\nwithin an hour after its private reception by the parties to it in San\r\nFrancisco. For this he was to have a large percentage of the profits on\r\npurchases and sales made on it by his fellow-conspirator. So he went,\r\ndisguised as a teamster, to a little wayside telegraph office in the\r\nmountains, got acquainted with the operator, and sat in the office day\r\nafter day, smoking his pipe, complaining that his team was fagged out\r\nand unable to travel\xe2\x80\x94and meantime listening to the dispatches as they\r\npassed clicking through the machine from Virginia. Finally the private\r\ndispatch announcing the result of the lawsuit sped over the wires, and\r\nas soon as he heard it he telegraphed his friend in San Francisco:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm tired waiting. Shall sell the team and go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the signal agreed upon. The word \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting\xe2\x80\x9d left out, would have\r\nsignified that the suit had gone the other way.\r\n\r\nThe mock teamster\xe2\x80\x99s friend picked up a deal of the mining stock, at low\r\nfigures, before the news became public, and a fortune was the result.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after one of the great Virginia mines had been\r\nincorporated, about fifty feet of the original location were still in\r\nthe hands of a man who had never signed the incorporation papers. The\r\nstock became very valuable, and every effort was made to find this man,\r\nbut he had disappeared. Once it was heard that he was in New York, and\r\none or two speculators went east but failed to find him. Once the news\r\ncame that he was in the Bermudas, and straightway a speculator or two\r\nhurried east and sailed for Bermuda\xe2\x80\x94but he was not there. Finally he was\r\nheard of in Mexico, and a friend of his, a bar-keeper on a salary,\r\nscraped together a little money and sought him out, bought his \xe2\x80\x9cfeet\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nfor a hundred dollars, returned and sold the property for $75,000.\r\n\r\nBut why go on? The traditions of Silverland are filled with instances\r\nlike these, and I would never get through enumerating them were I to\r\nattempt do it. I only desired to give, the reader an idea of a\r\npeculiarity of the \xe2\x80\x9cflush times\xe2\x80\x9d which I could not present so strikingly\r\nin any other way, and which some mention of was necessary to a realizing\r\ncomprehension of the time and the country.\r\n\r\nI was personally acquainted with the majority of the nabobs I have\r\nreferred to, and so, for old acquaintance sake, I have shifted their\r\noccupations and experiences around in such a way as to keep the Pacific\r\npublic from recognizing these once notorious men. No longer notorious,\r\nfor the majority of them have drifted back into poverty and obscurity\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn Nevada there used to be current the story of an adventure of two of\r\nher nabobs, which may or may not have occurred. I give it for what it is\r\nworth:\r\n\r\nCol. Jim had seen somewhat of the world, and knew more or less of its\r\nways; but Col. Jack was from the back settlements of the States, had led\r\na life of arduous toil, and had never seen a city. These two, blessed\r\nwith sudden wealth, projected a visit to New York,\xe2\x80\x94Col. Jack to see the\r\nsights, and Col. Jim to guard his unsophistication from misfortune. They\r\nreached San Francisco in the night, and sailed in the morning. Arrived\r\nin New York, Col. Jack said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard tell of carriages all my life, and now I mean to have a ride\r\nin one; I don\xe2\x80\x99t care what it costs. Come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey stepped out on the sidewalk, and Col. Jim called a stylish\r\nbarouche. But Col. Jack said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_No_, sir! None of your cheap-John turn-outs for me. I\xe2\x80\x99m here to have a\r\ngood time, and money ain\xe2\x80\x99t any object. I mean to have the nobbiest rig\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s going. Now here comes the very trick. Stop that yaller one with\r\nthe pictures on it\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t you fret\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll stand all the expenses myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo Col. Jim stopped an empty omnibus, and they got in. Said Col. Jack:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t it gay, though? Oh, no, I reckon not! Cushions, and windows, and\r\npictures, till you can\xe2\x80\x99t rest. What would the boys say if they _could_\r\nsee us cutting a swell like this in New York? By George, I wish they\r\ncould see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he put his head out of the window, and shouted to the driver:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay, Johnny, this suits _me_!\xe2\x80\x94suits yours truly, you bet, you! I want\r\nthis shebang all day. I\xe2\x80\x99m _on_ it, old man! Let \xe2\x80\x99em out! Make \xe2\x80\x99em go!\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll make it all right with _you_, sonny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe driver passed his hand through the strap-hole, and tapped for his\r\nfare\xe2\x80\x94it was before the gongs came into common use. Col. Jack took the\r\nhand, and shook it cordially. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n326.jpg (51K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou twig me, old pard! All right between gents. Smell of _that_, and\r\nsee how you like it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he put a twenty-dollar gold piece in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s hand. After a\r\nmoment the driver said he could not make change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBother the change! Ride it out. Put it in your pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen to Col. Jim, with a sounding slap on his thigh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ it style, though? Hanged if I don\xe2\x80\x99t hire this thing every day\r\nfor a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe omnibus stopped, and a young lady got in. Col. Jack stared a moment,\r\nthen nudged Col. Jim with his elbow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say a word,\xe2\x80\x9d he whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cLet her ride, if she wants to.\r\nGracious, there\xe2\x80\x99s room enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young lady got out her porte-monnaie, and handed her fare to Col.\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this for?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to the driver, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake back your money, madam. We can\xe2\x80\x99t allow it. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to ride\r\nhere as long as you please, but this shebang\xe2\x80\x99s chartered, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet you pay a cent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n327.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl shrunk into a corner, bewildered. An old lady with a basket\r\nclimbed in, and proffered her fare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Col. Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re perfectly welcome here, madam, but\r\nwe can\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to pay. Set right down there, mum, and don\xe2\x80\x99t you be\r\nthe least uneasy. Make yourself just as free as if you was in your own\r\nturn-out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithin two minutes, three gentlemen, two fat women, and a couple of\r\nchildren, entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome right along, friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Col. Jack; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t mind _us_. This is a\r\nfree blow-out.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he whispered to Col. Jim,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNew York ain\xe2\x80\x99t no sociable place, I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon\xe2\x80\x94it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no _name_ for\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe resisted every effort to pass fares to the driver, and made everybody\r\ncordially welcome. The situation dawned on the people, and they pocketed\r\ntheir money, and delivered themselves up to covert enjoyment of the\r\nepisode. Half a dozen more passengers entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, there\xe2\x80\x99s _plenty_ of room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Col. Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cWalk right in, and make\r\nyourselves at home. A blow-out ain\xe2\x80\x99t worth anything _as_ a blow-out,\r\nunless a body has company.\xe2\x80\x9d Then in a whisper to Col. Jim: \xe2\x80\x9cBut _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nthese New Yorkers friendly? And ain\xe2\x80\x99t they cool about it, too? Icebergs\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t anywhere. I reckon they\xe2\x80\x99d tackle a hearse, if it was going their\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore passengers got in; more yet, and still more. Both seats were\r\nfilled, and a file of men were standing up, holding on to the cleats\r\noverhead. Parties with baskets and bundles were climbing up on the roof.\r\nHalf-suppressed laughter rippled up from all sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, for clean, cool, out-and-out cheek, if this don\xe2\x80\x99t bang anything\r\nthat ever I saw, I\xe2\x80\x99m an Injun!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Col. Jack.\r\n\r\nA Chinaman crowded his way in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI weaken!\xe2\x80\x9d said Col. Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cHold on, driver! Keep your seats, ladies,\r\nand gents. Just make yourselves free\xe2\x80\x94everything\xe2\x80\x99s paid for. Driver,\r\nrustle these folks around as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re a mind to go\xe2\x80\x94friends of\r\nours, you know. Take them everywheres\xe2\x80\x94and if you want more money, come\r\nto the St. Nicholas, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it all right. Pleasant journey to\r\nyou, ladies and gents\xe2\x80\x94go it just as long as you please\xe2\x80\x94it shan\xe2\x80\x99t cost\r\nyou a cent!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n328.jpg (93K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two comrades got out, and Col. Jack said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJimmy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the sociablest place _I_ ever saw. The Chinaman waltzed in\r\nas comfortable as anybody. If we\xe2\x80\x99d staid awhile, I reckon we\xe2\x80\x99d had some\r\nniggers. B\xe2\x80\x99 George, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to barricade our doors to-night, or some\r\nof these ducks will be trying to sleep with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody has said that in order to know a community, one must observe\r\nthe style of its funerals and know what manner of men they bury with\r\nmost ceremony. I cannot say which class we buried with most eclat in our\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cflush times,\xe2\x80\x9d the distinguished public benefactor or the distinguished\r\nrough\xe2\x80\x94possibly the two chief grades or grand divisions of society\r\nhonored their illustrious dead about equally; and hence, no doubt the\r\nphilosopher I have quoted from would have needed to see two\r\nrepresentative funerals in Virginia before forming his estimate of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere was a grand time over Buck Fanshaw when he died. He was a\r\nrepresentative citizen. He had \xe2\x80\x9ckilled his man\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not in his own quarrel,\r\nit is true, but in defence of a stranger unfairly beset by numbers. He\r\nhad kept a sumptuous saloon. He had been the proprietor of a dashing\r\nhelpmeet whom he could have discarded without the formality of a\r\ndivorce. He had held a high position in the fire department and been a\r\nvery Warwick in politics. When he died there was great lamentation\r\nthroughout the town, but especially in the vast bottom-stratum of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nOn the inquest it was shown that Buck Fanshaw, in the delirium of a\r\nwasting typhoid fever, had taken arsenic, shot himself through the body,\r\ncut his throat, and jumped out of a four-story window and broken his\r\nneck\xe2\x80\x94and after due deliberation, the jury, sad and tearful, but with\r\nintelligence unblinded by its sorrow, brought in a verdict of death \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\nthe visitation of God.\xe2\x80\x9d What could the world do without juries?\r\n\r\nProdigious preparations were made for the funeral. All the vehicles in\r\ntown were hired, all the saloons put in mourning, all the municipal and\r\nfire-company flags hung at half-mast, and all the firemen ordered to\r\nmuster in uniform and bring their machines duly draped in black. Now\xe2\x80\x94let\r\nus remark in parenthesis\xe2\x80\x94as all the peoples of the earth had\r\nrepresentative adventurers in the Silverland, and as each adventurer had\r\nbrought the slang of his nation or his locality with him, the\r\ncombination made the slang of Nevada the richest and the most infinitely\r\nvaried and copious that had ever existed anywhere in the world, perhaps,\r\nexcept in the mines of California in the \xe2\x80\x9cearly days.\xe2\x80\x9d Slang was the\r\nlanguage of Nevada. It was hard to preach a sermon without it, and be\r\nunderstood. Such phrases as \xe2\x80\x9cYou bet!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, I reckon not!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo Irish\r\nneed apply,\xe2\x80\x9d and a hundred others, became so common as to fall from the\r\nlips of a speaker unconsciously\xe2\x80\x94and very often when they did not touch\r\nthe subject under discussion and consequently failed to mean anything.\r\n\r\nAfter Buck Fanshaw\xe2\x80\x99s inquest, a meeting of the short-haired brotherhood\r\nwas held, for nothing can be done on the Pacific coast without a public\r\nmeeting and an expression of sentiment. Regretful resolutions were\r\npassed and various committees appointed; among others, a committee of\r\none was deputed to call on the minister, a fragile, gentle, spiritual\r\nnew fledgling from an Eastern theological seminary, and as yet\r\nunacquainted with the ways of the mines. The committeeman, \xe2\x80\x9cScotty\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nBriggs, made his visit; and in after days it was worth something to hear\r\nthe minister tell about it. Scotty was a stalwart rough, whose customary\r\nsuit, when on weighty official business, like committee work, was a fire\r\nhelmet, flaming red flannel shirt, patent leather belt with spanner and\r\nrevolver attached, coat hung over arm, and pants stuffed into boot tops.\r\nHe formed something of a contrast to the pale theological student. It is\r\nfair to say of Scotty, however, in passing, that he had a warm heart,\r\nand a strong love for his friends, and never entered into a quarrel when\r\nhe could reasonably keep out of it. Indeed, it was commonly said that\r\nwhenever one of Scotty\xe2\x80\x99s fights was investigated, it always turned out\r\nthat it had originally been no affair of his, but that out of native\r\ngoodheartedness he had dropped in of his own accord to help the man who\r\nwas getting the worst of it. He and Buck Fanshaw were bosom friends, for\r\nyears, and had often taken adventurous \xe2\x80\x9cpot-luck\xe2\x80\x9d together. On one\r\noccasion, they had thrown off their coats and taken the weaker side in a\r\nfight among strangers, and after gaining a hard-earned victory, turned\r\nand found that the men they were helping had deserted early, and not\r\nonly that, but had stolen their coats and made off with them! But to\r\nreturn to Scotty\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the minister. He was on a sorrowful mission,\r\nnow, and his face was the picture of woe. Being admitted to the presence\r\nhe sat down before the clergyman, placed his fire-hat on an unfinished\r\nmanuscript sermon under the minister\xe2\x80\x99s nose, took from it a red silk\r\nhandkerchief, wiped his brow and heaved a sigh of dismal impressiveness,\r\nexplanatory of his business.\r\n\r\nHe choked, and even shed tears; but with an effort he mastered his voice\r\nand said in lugubrious tones:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you the duck that runs the gospel-mill next door?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I the\xe2\x80\x94pardon me, I believe I do not understand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith another sigh and a half-sob, Scotty rejoined:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you see we are in a bit of trouble, and the boys thought maybe you\r\nwould give us a lift, if we\xe2\x80\x99d tackle you\xe2\x80\x94that is, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the rights\r\nof it and you are the head clerk of the doxology-works next door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am the shepherd in charge of the flock whose fold is next door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe which?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spiritual adviser of the little company of believers whose\r\nsanctuary adjoins these premises.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n331.jpg (76K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScotty scratched his head, reflected a moment, and then said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou ruther hold over me, pard. I reckon I can\xe2\x80\x99t call that hand. Ante\r\nand pass the buck.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? I beg pardon. What did I understand you to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ve ruther got the bulge on me. Or maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ve both got the\r\nbulge, somehow. You don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke me and I don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke you. You see, one\r\nof the boys has passed in his checks and we want to give him a good\r\nsend-off, and so the thing I\xe2\x80\x99m on now is to roust out somebody to jerk a\r\nlittle chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend, I seem to grow more and more bewildered. Your observations\r\nare wholly incomprehensible to me. Cannot you simplify them in some way?\r\nAt first I thought perhaps I understood you, but I grope now. Would it\r\nnot expedite matters if you restricted yourself to categorical\r\nstatements of fact unencumbered with obstructing accumulations of\r\nmetaphor and allegory?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnother pause, and more reflection. Then, said Scotty:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pass, I judge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve raised me out, pard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still fail to catch your meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that last lead of yourn is too many for me\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea. I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t neither trump nor follow suit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe clergyman sank back in his chair perplexed. Scotty leaned his head\r\non his hand and gave himself up to thought.\r\n\r\nPresently his face came up, sorrowful but confident.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now, so\xe2\x80\x99s you can savvy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we want is a\r\ngospel-sharp. See?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGospel-sharp. Parson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Why did you not say so before? I am a clergyman\xe2\x80\x94a parson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you talk! You see my blind and straddle it like a man. Put it\r\nthere!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94extending a brawny paw, which closed over the minister\xe2\x80\x99s small\r\nhand and gave it a shake indicative of fraternal sympathy and fervent\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re all right, pard. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start fresh. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you mind my\r\nsnuffling a little\xe2\x80\x94becuz we\xe2\x80\x99re in a power of trouble. You see, one of\r\nthe boys has gone up the flume\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGone where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUp the flume\xe2\x80\x94throwed up the sponge, you understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrown up the sponge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94kicked the bucket\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh\xe2\x80\x94has departed to that mysterious country from whose bourne no\r\ntraveler returns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReturn! I reckon not. Why pard, he\xe2\x80\x99s _dead_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, you do? Well I thought maybe you might be getting tangled some\r\nmore. Yes, you see he\xe2\x80\x99s dead again\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Again_? Why, has he ever been dead before?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDead before? No! Do you reckon a man has got as many lives as a cat?\r\nBut you bet you he\xe2\x80\x99s awful dead now, poor old boy, and I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\nseen this day. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want no better friend than Buck Fanshaw. I knowed\r\nhim by the back; and when I know a man and like him, I freeze to him\xe2\x80\x94you\r\nhear _me_. Take him all round, pard, there never was a bullier man in\r\nthe mines. No man ever knowed Buck Fanshaw to go back on a friend. But\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s all up, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s all up. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t no use. They\xe2\x80\x99ve scooped\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cScooped him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94death has. Well, well, well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give him up. Yes indeed.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of a hard world, after all, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it? But pard, he was a\r\nrustler! You ought to seen him get started once. He was a bully boy with\r\na glass eye! Just spit in his face and give him room according to his\r\nstrength, and it was just beautiful to see him peel and go in. He was\r\nthe worst son of a thief that ever drawed breath. Pard, he was on it! He\r\nwas on it bigger than an Injun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn it? On what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the shoot. On the shoulder. On the fight, you understand. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngive a continental for anybody. _Beg_ your pardon, friend, for coming so\r\nnear saying a cuss-word\xe2\x80\x94but you see I\xe2\x80\x99m on an awful strain, in this\r\npalaver, on account of having to cramp down and draw everything so mild.\r\nBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give him up. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t any getting around that, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t reckon. Now if we can get you to help plant him\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPreach the funeral discourse? Assist at the obsequies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cObs\xe2\x80\x99quies is good. Yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s our little game. We are going\r\nto get the thing up regardless, you know. He was always nifty himself,\r\nand so you bet you his funeral ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to be no slouch\xe2\x80\x94solid silver\r\ndoor-plate on his coffin, six plumes on the hearse, and a nigger on the\r\nbox in a biled shirt and a plug hat\xe2\x80\x94how\xe2\x80\x99s that for high? And we\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\ncare of you, pard. We\xe2\x80\x99ll fix you all right. There\xe2\x80\x99ll be a kerridge for\r\nyou; and whatever you want, you just \xe2\x80\x99scape out and we\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x99tend to it.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a shebang fixed up for you to stand behind, in No. 1\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afraid. Just go in and toot your horn, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsell a clam. Put Buck through as bully as you can, pard, for anybody\r\nthat knowed him will tell you that he was one of the whitest men that\r\nwas ever in the mines. You can\xe2\x80\x99t draw it too strong. He never could\r\nstand it to see things going wrong. He\xe2\x80\x99s done more to make this town\r\nquiet and peaceable than any man in it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him lick four Greasers\r\nin eleven minutes, myself. If a thing wanted regulating, he warn\xe2\x80\x99t a man\r\nto go browsing around after somebody to do it, but he would prance in\r\nand regulate it himself. He warn\xe2\x80\x99t a Catholic. Scasely. He was down on\r\n\xe2\x80\x99em. His word was, \xe2\x80\x98No Irish need apply!\xe2\x80\x99 But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make no\r\ndifference about that when it came down to what a man\xe2\x80\x99s rights was\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nso, when some roughs jumped the Catholic bone-yard and started in to\r\nstake out town-lots in it he went for \xe2\x80\x99em! And he cleaned \xe2\x80\x99em, too! I\r\nwas there, pard, and I seen it myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n335.jpg (105K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was very well indeed\xe2\x80\x94at least the impulse was\xe2\x80\x94whether the act was\r\nstrictly defensible or not. Had deceased any religious convictions? That\r\nis to say, did he feel a dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance to a\r\nhigher power?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMore reflection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI reckon you\xe2\x80\x99ve stumped me again, pard. Could you say it over once\r\nmore, and say it slow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, to simplify it somewhat, was he, or rather had he ever been\r\nconnected with any organization sequestered from secular concerns and\r\ndevoted to self-sacrifice in the interests of morality?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll down but nine\xe2\x80\x94set \xe2\x80\x99em up on the other alley, pard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I understand you to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re most too many for me, you know. When you get in with your\r\nleft I hunt grass every time. Every time you draw, you fill; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseem to have any luck. Lets have a new deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? Begin again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Was he a good man, and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x94I see that; don\xe2\x80\x99t put up another chip till I look at my hand. A\r\ngood man, says you? Pard, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no name for it. He was the best man\r\nthat ever\xe2\x80\x94pard, you would have doted on that man. He could lam any\r\ngaloot of his inches in America. It was him that put down the riot last\r\nelection before it got a start; and everybody said he was the only man\r\nthat could have done it. He waltzed in with a spanner in one hand and a\r\ntrumpet in the other, and sent fourteen men home on a shutter in less\r\nthan three minutes. He had that riot all broke up and prevented nice\r\nbefore anybody ever got a chance to strike a blow. He was always for\r\npeace, and he would have peace\xe2\x80\x94he could not stand disturbances. Pard, he\r\nwas a great loss to this town. It would please the boys if you could\r\nchip in something like that and do him justice. Here once when the Micks\r\ngot to throwing stones through the Methodis\xe2\x80\x99 Sunday school windows, Buck\r\nFanshaw, all of his own notion, shut up his saloon and took a couple of\r\nsix-shooters and mounted guard over the Sunday school. Says he, \xe2\x80\x98No\r\nIrish need apply!\xe2\x80\x99 And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He was the bulliest man in the\r\nmountains, pard! He could run faster, jump higher, hit harder, and hold\r\nmore tangle-foot whisky without spilling it than any man in seventeen\r\ncounties. Put that in, pard\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99ll please the boys more than anything you\r\ncould say. And you can say, pard, that he never shook his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n337.jpg (60K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever shook his mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it\xe2\x80\x94any of the boys will tell you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but why should he shake her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I say\xe2\x80\x94but some people does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot people of any repute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, some that averages pretty so-so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion the man that would offer personal violence to his own\r\nmother, ought to\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheese it, pard; you\xe2\x80\x99ve banked your ball clean outside the string. What\r\nI was a drivin\xe2\x80\x99 at, was, that he never throwed off on his mother\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see? No indeedy. He give her a house to live in, and town lots, and\r\nplenty of money; and he looked after her and took care of her all the\r\ntime; and when she was down with the small-pox I\xe2\x80\x99m d\xe2\x80\x94-d if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t set\r\nup nights and nuss her himself! Beg your pardon for saying it, but it\r\nhopped out too quick for yours truly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve treated me like a gentleman, pard, and I ain\xe2\x80\x99t the man to hurt\r\nyour feelings intentional. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re white. I think you\xe2\x80\x99re a square\r\nman, pard. I like you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lick any man that don\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99ll lick him\r\ntill he can\xe2\x80\x99t tell himself from a last year\xe2\x80\x99s corpse! Put it there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n[Another fraternal hand-shake\xe2\x80\x94and exit.]\r\n\r\nThe obsequies were all that \xe2\x80\x9cthe boys\xe2\x80\x9d could desire. Such a marvel of\r\nfuneral pomp had never been seen in Virginia. The plumed hearse, the\r\ndirge-breathing brass bands, the closed marts of business, the flags\r\ndrooping at half mast, the long, plodding procession of uniformed secret\r\nsocieties, military battalions and fire companies, draped engines,\r\ncarriages of officials, and citizens in vehicles and on foot, attracted\r\nmultitudes of spectators to the sidewalks, roofs and windows; and for\r\nyears afterward, the degree of grandeur attained by any civic display in\r\nVirginia was determined by comparison with Buck Fanshaw\xe2\x80\x99s funeral.\r\n\r\nScotty Briggs, as a pall-bearer and a mourner, occupied a prominent\r\nplace at the funeral, and when the sermon was finished and the last\r\nsentence of the prayer for the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s soul ascended, he responded,\r\nin a low voice, but with feelings:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAMEN. No Irish need apply.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the bulk of the response was without apparent relevancy, it was\r\nprobably nothing more than a humble tribute to the memory of the friend\r\nthat was gone; for, as Scotty had once said, it was \xe2\x80\x9chis word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nScotty Briggs, in after days, achieved the distinction of becoming the\r\nonly convert to religion that was ever gathered from the Virginia\r\nroughs; and it transpired that the man who had it in him to espouse the\r\nquarrel of the weak out of inborn nobility of spirit was no mean timber\r\nwhereof to construct a Christian. The making him one did not warp his\r\ngenerosity or diminish his courage; on the contrary it gave intelligent\r\ndirection to the one and a broader field to the other.\r\n\r\nIf his Sunday-school class progressed faster than the other classes, was\r\nit matter for wonder? I think not. He talked to his pioneer small-fry in\r\na language they understood! It was my large privilege, a month before he\r\ndied, to hear him tell the beautiful story of Joseph and his brethren to\r\nhis class \xe2\x80\x9cwithout looking at the book.\xe2\x80\x9d I leave it to the reader to\r\nfancy what it was like, as it fell, riddled with slang, from the lips of\r\nthat grave, earnest teacher, and was listened to by his little learners\r\nwith a consuming interest that showed that they were as unconscious as\r\nhe was that any violence was being done to the sacred proprieties!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n338.jpg (52K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first twenty-six graves in the Virginia cemetery were occupied by\r\nmurdered men. So everybody said, so everybody believed, and so they will\r\nalways say and believe. The reason why there was so much slaughtering\r\ndone, was, that in a new mining district the rough element predominates,\r\nand a person is not respected until he has \xe2\x80\x9ckilled his man.\xe2\x80\x9d That was\r\nthe very expression used.\r\n\r\nIf an unknown individual arrived, they did not inquire if he was\r\ncapable, honest, industrious, but\xe2\x80\x94had he killed his man? If he had not,\r\nhe gravitated to his natural and proper position, that of a man of small\r\nconsequence; if he had, the cordiality of his reception was graduated\r\naccording to the number of his dead. It was tedious work struggling up\r\nto a position of influence with bloodless hands; but when a man came\r\nwith the blood of half a dozen men on his soul, his worth was recognized\r\nat once and his acquaintance sought.\r\n\r\nIn Nevada, for a time, the lawyer, the editor, the banker, the chief\r\ndesperado, the chief gambler, and the saloon keeper, occupied the same\r\nlevel in society, and it was the highest. The cheapest and easiest way\r\nto become an influential man and be looked up to by the community at\r\nlarge, was to stand behind a bar, wear a cluster-diamond pin, and sell\r\nwhisky. I am not sure but that the saloon-keeper held a shade higher\r\nrank than any other member of society. His opinion had weight. It was\r\nhis privilege to say how the elections should go. No great movement\r\ncould succeed without the countenance and direction of the saloon-\r\nkeepers. It was a high favor when the chief saloon-keeper consented to\r\nserve in the legislature or the board of aldermen.\r\n\r\nYouthful ambition hardly aspired so much to the honors of the law, or\r\nthe army and navy as to the dignity of proprietorship in a saloon.\r\n\r\nTo be a saloon-keeper and kill a man was to be illustrious. Hence the\r\nreader will not be surprised to learn that more than one man was killed\r\nin Nevada under hardly the pretext of provocation, so impatient was the\r\nslayer to achieve reputation and throw off the galling sense of being\r\nheld in indifferent repute by his associates. I knew two youths who\r\ntried to \xe2\x80\x9ckill their men\xe2\x80\x9d for no other reason\xe2\x80\x94and got killed themselves\r\nfor their pains. \xe2\x80\x9cThere goes the man that killed Bill Adams\xe2\x80\x9d was higher\r\npraise and a sweeter sound in the ears of this sort of people than any\r\nother speech that admiring lips could utter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n340.jpg (115K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men who murdered Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s original twenty-six cemetery-occupants\r\nwere never punished. Why? Because Alfred the Great, when he invented\r\ntrial by jury and knew that he had admirably framed it to secure justice\r\nin his age of the world, was not aware that in the nineteenth century\r\nthe condition of things would be so entirely changed that unless he rose\r\nfrom the grave and altered the jury plan to meet the emergency, it would\r\nprove the most ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice\r\nthat human wisdom could contrive. For how could he imagine that we\r\nsimpletons would go on using his jury plan after circumstances had\r\nstripped it of its usefulness, any more than he could imagine that we\r\nwould go on using his candle-clock after we had invented chronometers?\r\nIn his day news could not travel fast, and hence he could easily find a\r\njury of honest, intelligent men who had not heard of the case they were\r\ncalled to try\xe2\x80\x94but in our day of telegraphs and newspapers his plan\r\ncompels us to swear in juries composed of fools and rascals, because the\r\nsystem rigidly excludes honest men and men of brains.\r\n\r\nI remember one of those sorrowful farces, in Virginia, which we call a\r\njury trial. A noted desperado killed Mr. B., a good citizen, in the most\r\nwanton and cold-blooded way. Of course the papers were full of it, and\r\nall men capable of reading, read about it. And of course all men not\r\ndeaf and dumb and idiotic, talked about it. A jury-list was made out,\r\nand Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was questioned\r\nprecisely as he would have been questioned in any court in America:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard of this homicide?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you held conversations upon the subject?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you formed or expressed opinions about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you read the newspaper accounts of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not want you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA minister, intelligent, esteemed, and greatly respected; a merchant of\r\nhigh character and known probity; a mining superintendent of\r\nintelligence and unblemished reputation; a quartz mill owner of\r\nexcellent standing, were all questioned in the same way, and all set\r\naside. Each said the public talk and the newspaper reports had not so\r\nbiased his mind but that sworn testimony would overthrow his previously\r\nformed opinions and enable him to render a verdict without prejudice and\r\nin accordance with the facts. But of course such men could not be\r\ntrusted with the case. Ignoramuses alone could mete out unsullied\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nWhen the peremptory challenges were all exhausted, a jury of twelve men\r\nwas impaneled\xe2\x80\x94a jury who swore they had neither heard, read, talked\r\nabout nor expressed an opinion concerning a murder which the very cattle\r\nin the corrals, the Indians in the sage-brush and the stones in the\r\nstreets were cognizant of! It was a jury composed of two desperadoes,\r\ntwo low beer-house politicians, three bar-keepers, two ranchmen who\r\ncould not read, and three dull, stupid, human donkeys! It actually came\r\nout afterward, that one of these latter thought that incest and arson\r\nwere the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n342.jpg (52K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe verdict rendered by this jury was, Not Guilty. What else could one\r\nexpect?\r\n\r\nThe jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty, and a premium\r\nupon ignorance, stupidity and perjury. It is a shame that we must\r\ncontinue to use a worthless system because it _was_ good a thousand\r\nyears ago. In this age, when a gentleman of high social standing,\r\nintelligence and probity, swears that testimony given under solemn oath\r\nwill outweigh, with him, street talk and newspaper reports based upon\r\nmere hearsay, he is worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to their own\r\nignorance and stupidity, and justice would be far safer in his hands\r\nthan in theirs. Why could not the jury law be so altered as to give men\r\nof brains and honesty and _equal chance_ with fools and miscreants? Is\r\nit right to show the present favoritism to one class of men and inflict\r\na disability on another, in a land whose boast is that all its citizens\r\nare free and equal? I am a candidate for the legislature. I desire to\r\ntamper with the jury law. I wish to so alter it as to put a premium on\r\nintelligence and character, and close the jury box against idiots,\r\nblacklegs, and people who do not read newspapers. But no doubt I shall\r\nbe defeated\xe2\x80\x94every effort I make to save the country \xe2\x80\x9cmisses fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy idea, when I began this chapter, was to say something about\r\ndesperadoism in the \xe2\x80\x9cflush times\xe2\x80\x9d of Nevada. To attempt a portrayal of\r\nthat era and that land, and leave out the blood and carnage, would be\r\nlike portraying Mormondom and leaving out polygamy. The desperado\r\nstalked the streets with a swagger graded according to the number of his\r\nhomicides, and a nod of recognition from him was sufficient to make a\r\nhumble admirer happy for the rest of the day. The deference that was\r\npaid to a desperado of wide reputation, and who \xe2\x80\x9ckept his private\r\ngraveyard,\xe2\x80\x9d as the phrase went, was marked, and cheerfully accorded.\r\nWhen he moved along the sidewalk in his excessively long-tailed frock-\r\ncoat, shiny stump-toed boots, and with dainty little slouch hat tipped\r\nover left eye, the small-fry roughs made room for his majesty; when he\r\nentered the restaurant, the waiters deserted bankers and merchants to\r\noverwhelm him with obsequious service; when he shouldered his way to a\r\nbar, the shouldered parties wheeled indignantly, recognized him,\r\nand\xe2\x80\x94apologized.\r\n\r\nThey got a look in return that froze their marrow, and by that time a\r\ncurled and breast-pinned bar keeper was beaming over the counter, proud\r\nof the established acquaintanceship that permitted such a familiar form\r\nof speech as:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99re ye, Billy, old fel? Glad to see you. What\xe2\x80\x99ll you take\xe2\x80\x94the old\r\nthing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cold thing\xe2\x80\x9d meant his customary drink, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n344.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best known names in the Territory of Nevada were those belonging to\r\nthese long-tailed heroes of the revolver. Orators, Governors,\r\ncapitalists and leaders of the legislature enjoyed a degree of fame, but\r\nit seemed local and meagre when contrasted with the fame of such men as\r\nSam Brown, Jack Williams, Billy Mulligan, Farmer Pease, Sugarfoot Mike,\r\nPock Marked Jake, El Dorado Johnny, Jack McNabb, Joe McGee, Jack Harris,\r\nSix-fingered Pete, etc., etc. There was a long list of them. They were\r\nbrave, reckless men, and traveled with their lives in their hands. To\r\ngive them their due, they did their killing principally among\r\nthemselves, and seldom molested peaceable citizens, for they considered\r\nit small credit to add to their trophies so cheap a bauble as the death\r\nof a man who was \xe2\x80\x9cnot on the shoot,\xe2\x80\x9d as they phrased it. They killed\r\neach other on slight provocation, and hoped and expected to be killed\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94for they held it almost shame to die otherwise than \xe2\x80\x9cwith\r\ntheir boots on,\xe2\x80\x9d as they expressed it.\r\n\r\nI remember an instance of a desperado\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for such small game as\r\na private citizen\xe2\x80\x99s life. I was taking a late supper in a restaurant one\r\nnight, with two reporters and a little printer named\xe2\x80\x94Brown, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94any name will do. Presently a stranger with a long-tailed coat\r\non came in, and not noticing Brown\xe2\x80\x99s hat, which was lying in a chair,\r\nsat down on it. Little Brown sprang up and became abusive in a moment.\r\nThe stranger smiled, smoothed out the hat, and offered it to Brown with\r\nprofuse apologies couched in caustic sarcasm, and begged Brown not to\r\ndestroy him. Brown threw off his coat and challenged the man to\r\nfight\xe2\x80\x94abused him, threatened him, impeached his courage, and urged and\r\neven implored him to fight; and in the meantime the smiling stranger\r\nplaced himself under our protection in mock distress. But presently he\r\nassumed a serious tone, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, gentlemen, if we must fight, we must, I suppose. But don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrush into danger and then say I gave you no warning. I am more than a\r\nmatch for all of you when I get started. I will give you proofs, and\r\nthen if my friend here still insists, I will try to accommodate him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe table we were sitting at was about five feet long, and unusually\r\ncumbersome and heavy. He asked us to put our hands on the dishes and\r\nhold them in their places a moment\xe2\x80\x94one of them was a large oval dish\r\nwith a portly roast on it. Then he sat down, tilted up one end of the\r\ntable, set two of the legs on his knees, took the end of the table\r\nbetween his teeth, took his hands away, and pulled down with his teeth\r\ntill the table came up to a level position, dishes and all! He said he\r\ncould lift a keg of nails with his teeth. He picked up a common glass\r\ntumbler and bit a semi-circle out of it. Then he opened his bosom and\r\nshowed us a net-work of knife and bullet scars; showed us more on his\r\narms and face, and said he believed he had bullets enough in his body to\r\nmake a pig of lead. He was armed to the teeth. He closed with the remark\r\nthat he was Mr.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94of Cariboo\xe2\x80\x94a celebrated name whereat we shook in our\r\nshoes. I would publish the name, but for the suspicion that he might\r\ncome and carve me. He finally inquired if Brown still thirsted for\r\nblood. Brown turned the thing over in his mind a moment, and then\xe2\x80\x94asked\r\nhim to supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n346.jpg (73K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the permission of the reader, I will group together, in the next\r\nchapter, some samples of life in our small mountain village in the old\r\ndays of desperadoism. I was there at the time. The reader will observe\r\npeculiarities in our official society; and he will observe also, an\r\ninstance of how, in new countries, murders breed murders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn extract or two from the newspapers of the day will furnish a\r\nphotograph that can need no embellishment:\r\n\r\nFATAL SHOOTING AFFRAY.\xe2\x80\x94An affray occurred, last evening, in a billiard\r\nsaloon on C street, between Deputy Marshal Jack Williams and Wm. Brown,\r\nwhich resulted in the immediate death of the latter. There had been some\r\ndifficulty between the parties for several months.\r\n\r\nAn inquest was immediately held, and the following testimony adduced:\r\n\r\nOfficer GEO. BIRDSALL, sworn, says:\xe2\x80\x94I was told Wm. Brown was drunk and\r\nwas looking for Jack Williams; so soon as I heard that I started for the\r\nparties to prevent a collision; went into the billiard saloon; saw Billy\r\nBrown running around, saying if anybody had anything against him to show\r\ncause; he was talking in a boisterous manner, and officer Perry took him\r\nto the other end of the room to talk to him; Brown came back to me;\r\nremarked to me that he thought he was as good as anybody, and knew how\r\nto take care of himself; he passed by me and went to the bar; don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhether he drank or not; Williams was at the end of the billiard-table,\r\nnext to the stairway; Brown, after going to the bar, came back and said\r\nhe was as good as any man in the world; he had then walked out to the\r\nend of the first billiard-table from the bar; I moved closer to them,\r\nsupposing there would be a fight; as Brown drew his pistol I caught hold\r\nof it; he had fired one shot at Williams; don\xe2\x80\x99t know the effect of it;\r\ncaught hold of him with one hand, and took hold of the pistol and turned\r\nit up; think he fired once after I caught hold of the pistol; I wrenched\r\nthe pistol from him; walked to the end of the billiard-table and told a\r\nparty that I had Brown\xe2\x80\x99s pistol, and to stop shooting; I think four\r\nshots were fired in all; after walking out, Mr. Foster remarked that\r\nBrown was shot dead.\r\n\r\nOh, there was no excitement about it\xe2\x80\x94he merely \xe2\x80\x9cremarked\xe2\x80\x9d the small\r\ncircumstance!\r\n\r\nFour months later the following item appeared in the same paper (the\r\nEnterprise). In this item the name of one of the city officers above\r\nreferred to (Deputy Marshal Jack Williams) occurs again:\r\n\r\nROBBERY AND DESPERATE AFFRAY.\xe2\x80\x94On Tuesday night, a German named Charles\r\nHurtzal, engineer in a mill at Silver City, came to this place, and\r\nvisited the hurdy-gurdy house on B street. The music, dancing and\r\nTeutonic maidens awakened memories of Faderland until our German friend\r\nwas carried away with rapture. He evidently had money, and was spending\r\nif freely. Late in the evening Jack Williams and Andy Blessington\r\ninvited him down stairs to take a cup of coffee. Williams proposed a\r\ngame of cards and went up stairs to procure a deck, but not finding any\r\nreturned. On the stairway he met the German, and drawing his pistol\r\nknocked him down and rifled his pockets of some seventy dollars. Hurtzal\r\ndared give no alarm, as he was told, with a pistol at his head, if he\r\nmade any noise or exposed them, they would blow his brains out. So\r\neffectually was he frightened that he made no complaint, until his\r\nfriends forced him. Yesterday a warrant was issued, but the culprits had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThis efficient city officer, Jack Williams, had the common reputation of\r\nbeing a burglar, a highwayman and a desperado. It was said that he had\r\nseveral times drawn his revolver and levied money contributions on\r\ncitizens at dead of night in the public streets of Virginia.\r\n\r\nFive months after the above item appeared, Williams was assassinated\r\nwhile sitting at a card table one night; a gun was thrust through the\r\ncrack of the door and Williams dropped from his chair riddled with\r\nballs. It was said, at the time, that Williams had been for some time\r\naware that a party of his own sort (desperadoes) had sworn away his\r\nlife; and it was generally believed among the people that Williams\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfriends and enemies would make the assassination memorable\xe2\x80\x94and useful,\r\ntoo\xe2\x80\x94by a wholesale destruction of each other.\r\n\r\nIt did not so happen, but still, times were not dull during the next\r\ntwenty-four hours, for within that time a woman was killed by a pistol\r\nshot, a man was brained with a slung shot, and a man named Reeder was\r\nalso disposed of permanently. Some matters in the Enterprise account of\r\nthe killing of Reeder are worth nothing\xe2\x80\x94especially the accommodating\r\ncomplaisance of a Virginia justice of the peace. The italics in the\r\nfollowing narrative are mine:\r\n\r\nMORE CUTTING AND SHOOTING.\xe2\x80\x94The devil seems to have again broken loose in\r\nour town. Pistols and guns explode and knives gleam in our streets as in\r\nearly times. When there has been a long season of quiet, people are slow\r\nto wet their hands in blood; but once blood is spilled, cutting and\r\nshooting come easy. Night before last Jack Williams was assassinated,\r\nand yesterday forenoon we had more bloody work, growing out of the\r\nkilling of Williams, and on the same street in which he met his death.\r\nIt appears that Tom Reeder, a friend of Williams, and George Gumbert\r\nwere talking, at the meat market of the latter, about the killing of\r\nWilliams the previous night, when Reeder said it was a most cowardly act\r\nto shoot a man in such a way, giving him \xe2\x80\x9cno show.\xe2\x80\x9d Gumbert said that\r\nWilliams had \xe2\x80\x9cas good a show as he gave Billy Brown,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning the man\r\nkilled by Williams last March. Reeder said it was a d\xe2\x80\x94-d lie, that\r\nWilliams had no show at all. At this, Gumbert drew a knife and stabbed\r\nReeder, cutting him in two places in the back. One stroke of the knife\r\ncut into the sleeve of Reeder\xe2\x80\x99s coat and passed downward in a slanting\r\ndirection through his clothing, and entered his body at the small of the\r\nback; another blow struck more squarely, and made a much more dangerous\r\nwound. Gumbert gave himself up to the officers of justice, and was\r\nshortly after discharged by Justice Atwill, on his own recognizance, to\r\nappear for trial at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening. In the meantime Reeder\r\nhad been taken into the office of Dr. Owens, where his wounds were\r\nproperly dressed. One of his wounds was considered quite dangerous, and\r\nit was thought by many that it would prove fatal. But being considerably\r\nunder the influence of liquor, Reeder did not feel his wounds as he\r\notherwise would, and he got up and went into the street. He went to the\r\nmeat market and renewed his quarrel with Gumbert, threatening his life.\r\nFriends tried to interfere to put a stop to the quarrel and get the\r\nparties away from each other. In the Fashion Saloon Reeder made threats\r\nagainst the life of Gumbert, saying he would kill him, and it is said\r\nthat he requested the officers not to arrest Gumbert, as he intended to\r\nkill him. After these threats Gumbert went off and procured a double-\r\nbarreled shot gun, loaded with buck-shot or revolver balls, and went\r\nafter Reeder. Two or three persons were assisting him along the street,\r\ntrying to get him home, and had him just in front of the store of\r\nKlopstock & Harris, when Gumbert came across toward him from the\r\nopposite side of the street with his gun. He came up within about ten or\r\nfifteen feet of Reeder, and called out to those with him to \xe2\x80\x9clook out!\r\nget out of the way!\xe2\x80\x9d and they had only time to heed the warning, when he\r\nfired. Reeder was at the time attempting to screen himself behind a\r\nlarge cask, which stood against the awning post of Klopstock & Harris\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstore, but some of the balls took effect in the lower part of his\r\nbreast, and he reeled around forward and fell in front of the cask.\r\nGumbert then raised his gun and fired the second barrel, which missed\r\nReeder and entered the ground. At the time that this occurred, there\r\nwere a great many persons on the street in the vicinity, and a number of\r\nthem called out to Gumbert, when they saw him raise his gun, to \xe2\x80\x9chold\r\non,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t shoot!\xe2\x80\x9d The cutting took place about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock and the\r\nshooting about twelve. After the shooting the street was instantly\r\ncrowded with the inhabitants of that part of the town, some appearing\r\nmuch excited and laughing\xe2\x80\x94declaring that it looked like the \xe2\x80\x9cgood old\r\ntimes of \xe2\x80\x9860.\xe2\x80\x9d Marshal Perry and officer Birdsall were near when the\r\nshooting occurred, and Gumbert was immediately arrested and his gun\r\ntaken from him, when he was marched off to jail. Many persons who were\r\nattracted to the spot where this bloody work had just taken place,\r\nlooked bewildered and seemed to be asking themselves what was to happen\r\nnext, appearing in doubt as to whether the killing mania had reached its\r\nclimax, or whether we were to turn in and have a grand killing spell,\r\nshooting whoever might have given us offence. It was whispered around\r\nthat it was not all over yet\xe2\x80\x94five or six more were to be killed before\r\nnight. Reeder was taken to the Virginia City Hotel, and doctors called\r\nin to examine his wounds. They found that two or three balls had entered\r\nhis right side; one of them appeared to have passed through the\r\nsubstance of the lungs, while another passed into the liver. Two balls\r\nwere also found to have struck one of his legs. As some of the balls\r\nstruck the cask, the wounds in Reeder\xe2\x80\x99s leg were probably from these,\r\nglancing downwards, though they might have been caused by the second\r\nshot fired. After being shot, Reeder said when he got on his\r\nfeet\xe2\x80\x94smiling as he spoke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIt will take better shooting than that to kill\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d The doctors consider it almost impossible for him to recover, but\r\nas he has an excellent constitution he may survive, notwithstanding the\r\nnumber and dangerous character of the wounds he has received. The town\r\nappears to be perfectly quiet at present, as though the late stormy\r\ntimes had cleared our moral atmosphere; but who can tell in what quarter\r\nclouds are lowering or plots ripening?\r\n\r\nReeder\xe2\x80\x94or at least what was left of him\xe2\x80\x94survived his wounds two days!\r\nNothing was ever done with Gumbert.\r\n\r\nTrial by jury is the palladium of our liberties. I do not know what a\r\npalladium is, having never seen a palladium, but it is a good thing no\r\ndoubt at any rate. Not less than a hundred men have been murdered in\r\nNevada\xe2\x80\x94perhaps I would be within bounds if I said three hundred\xe2\x80\x94and as\r\nfar as I can learn, only two persons have suffered the death penalty\r\nthere. However, four or five who had no money and no political influence\r\nhave been punished by imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94one languished in prison as much as\r\neight months, I think. However, I do not desire to be extravagant\xe2\x80\x94it may\r\nhave been less.\r\n\r\nHowever, one prophecy was verified, at any rate. It was asserted by the\r\ndesperadoes that one of their brethren (Joe McGee, a special policeman)\r\nwas known to be the conspirator chosen by lot to assassinate Williams;\r\nand they also asserted that doom had been pronounced against McGee, and\r\nthat he would be assassinated in exactly the same manner that had been\r\nadopted for the destruction of Williams\xe2\x80\x94a prophecy which came true a\r\nyear later. After twelve months of distress (for McGee saw a fancied\r\nassassin in every man that approached him), he made the last of many\r\nefforts to get out of the country unwatched. He went to Carson and sat\r\ndown in a saloon to wait for the stage\xe2\x80\x94it would leave at four in the\r\nmorning. But as the night waned and the crowd thinned, he grew uneasy,\r\nand told the bar-keeper that assassins were on his track. The bar-keeper\r\ntold him to stay in the middle of the room, then, and not go near the\r\ndoor, or the window by the stove. But a fatal fascination seduced him to\r\nthe neighborhood of the stove every now and then, and repeatedly the\r\nbar-keeper brought him back to the middle of the room and warned him to\r\nremain there. But he could not. At three in the morning he again\r\nreturned to the stove and sat down by a stranger. Before the bar-keeper\r\ncould get to him with another warning whisper, some one outside fired\r\nthrough the window and riddled McGee\xe2\x80\x99s breast with slugs, killing him\r\nalmost instantly. By the same discharge the stranger at McGee\xe2\x80\x99s side\r\nalso received attentions which proved fatal in the course of two or\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n351.jpg (9K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese murder and jury statistics remind me of a certain very\r\nextraordinary trial and execution of twenty years ago; it is a scrap of\r\nhistory familiar to all old Californians, and worthy to be known by\r\nother peoples of the earth that love simple, straightforward justice\r\nunencumbered with nonsense. I would apologize for this digression but\r\nfor the fact that the information I am about to offer is apology enough\r\nin itself. And since I digress constantly anyhow, perhaps it is as well\r\nto eschew apologies altogether and thus prevent their growing irksome.\r\n\r\nCapt. Ned Blakely\xe2\x80\x94that name will answer as well as any other fictitious\r\none (for he was still with the living at last accounts, and may not\r\ndesire to be famous)\xe2\x80\x94sailed ships out of the harbor of San Francisco for\r\nmany years. He was a stalwart, warm-hearted, eagle-eyed veteran, who had\r\nbeen a sailor nearly fifty years\xe2\x80\x94a sailor from early boyhood. He was a\r\nrough, honest creature, full of pluck, and just as full of hard-headed\r\nsimplicity, too. He hated trifling conventionalities\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbusiness\xe2\x80\x9d was the\r\nword, with him. He had all a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s vindictiveness against the quips\r\nand quirks of the law, and steadfastly believed that the first and last\r\naim and object of the law and lawyers was to defeat justice.\r\n\r\nHe sailed for the Chincha Islands in command of a guano ship. He had a\r\nfine crew, but his negro mate was his pet\xe2\x80\x94on him he had for years\r\nlavished his admiration and esteem. It was Capt. Ned\xe2\x80\x99s first voyage to\r\nthe Chinchas, but his fame had gone before him\xe2\x80\x94the fame of being a man\r\nwho would fight at the dropping of a handkerchief, when imposed upon,\r\nand would stand no nonsense. It was a fame well earned. Arrived in the\r\nislands, he found that the staple of conversation was the exploits of\r\none Bill Noakes, a bully, the mate of a trading ship. This man had\r\ncreated a small reign of terror there. At nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night, Capt.\r\nNed, all alone, was pacing his deck in the starlight. A form ascended\r\nthe side, and approached him. Capt. Ned said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n353.jpg (77K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Bill Noakes, the best man in the islands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want aboard this ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of Capt. Ned Blakely, and one of us is a better man than\r\n\xe2\x80\x99tother\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll know which, before I go ashore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the right shop\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m your man. I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn you to come\r\naboard this ship without an _in_vite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seized Noakes, backed him against the mainmast, pounded his face to a\r\npulp, and then threw him overboard.\r\n\r\nNoakes was not convinced. He returned the next night, got the pulp\r\nrenewed, and went overboard head first, as before.\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied.\r\n\r\nA week after this, while Noakes was carousing with a sailor crowd on\r\nshore, at noonday, Capt. Ned\xe2\x80\x99s colored mate came along, and Noakes tried\r\nto pick a quarrel with him. The negro evaded the trap, and tried to get\r\naway. Noakes followed him up; the negro began to run; Noakes fired on\r\nhim with a revolver and killed him. Half a dozen sea-captains witnessed\r\nthe whole affair. Noakes retreated to the small after-cabin of his ship,\r\nwith two other bullies, and gave out that death would be the portion of\r\nany man that intruded there. There was no attempt made to follow the\r\nvillains; there was no disposition to do it, and indeed very little\r\nthought of such an enterprise. There were no courts and no officers;\r\nthere was no government; the islands belonged to Peru, and Peru was far\r\naway; she had no official representative on the ground; and neither had\r\nany other nation.\r\n\r\nHowever, Capt. Ned was not perplexing his head about such things. They\r\nconcerned him not. He was boiling with rage and furious for justice. At\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night he loaded a double-barreled gun with slugs, fished\r\nout a pair of handcuffs, got a ship\xe2\x80\x99s lantern, summoned his\r\nquartermaster, and went ashore. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see that ship there at the dock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy-ay, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the Venus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy-ay, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x94you know _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy-ay, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then. Take the lantern. Carry it just under your chin. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwalk behind you and rest this gun-barrel on your shoulder, p\xe2\x80\x99inting\r\nforward\xe2\x80\x94so. Keep your lantern well up so\xe2\x80\x99s I can see things ahead of you\r\ngood. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to march in on Noakes\xe2\x80\x94and take him\xe2\x80\x94and jug the other\r\nchaps. If you flinch\xe2\x80\x94well, you know _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy-ay, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this order they filed aboard softly, arrived at Noakes\xe2\x80\x99s den, the\r\nquartermaster pushed the door open, and the lantern revealed the three\r\ndesperadoes sitting on the floor. Capt. Ned said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n355.jpg (93K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Ned Blakely. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you under fire. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you move without\r\norders\xe2\x80\x94any of you. You two kneel down in the corner; faces to the\r\nwall\xe2\x80\x94now. Bill Noakes, put these handcuffs on; now come up close.\r\nQuartermaster, fasten \xe2\x80\x99em. All right. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir, sir. Quartermaster,\r\nput the key in the outside of the door. Now, men, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to lock you\r\ntwo in; and if you try to burst through this door\xe2\x80\x94well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of\r\n_me_. Bill Noakes, fall in ahead, and march. All set. Quartermaster,\r\nlock the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNoakes spent the night on board Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s ship, a prisoner under strict\r\nguard. Early in the morning Capt. Ned called in all the sea-captains in\r\nthe harbor and invited them, with nautical ceremony, to be present on\r\nboard his ship at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock to witness the hanging of Noakes at the\r\nyard-arm!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! The man has not been tried.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. But didn\xe2\x80\x99t he kill the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly he did; but you are not thinking of hanging him without a\r\ntrial?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Trial_! What do I want to try him for, if he killed the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Capt. Ned, this will _never_ do. Think how it will sound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSound be hanged! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he kill the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly, Capt. Ned,\xe2\x80\x94nobody denies that,\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen I\xe2\x80\x99m _going to hang him_, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Everybody I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to\r\ntalks just the same way you do. Everybody says he killed the nigger,\r\neverybody knows he killed the nigger, and yet every lubber of you wants\r\nhim _tried_ for it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand such bloody foolishness as that.\r\n_Tried_! Mind you, I don\xe2\x80\x99t object to trying him, if it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be done\r\nto give satisfaction; and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there, and chip in and help, too; but\r\nput it off till afternoon\xe2\x80\x94put it off till afternoon, for I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my\r\nhands middling full till after the burying\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you mean? Are you going to _hang_ him any how\xe2\x80\x94and try him\r\nafterward?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I say I was going to _hang_ him? I never saw such people as you.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the difference? You ask a favor, and then you ain\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied\r\nwhen you get it. Before or after\xe2\x80\x99s all one\xe2\x80\x94_you_ know how the trial will\r\ngo. He killed the nigger. Say\xe2\x80\x94I must be going. If your mate would like\r\nto come to the hanging, fetch him along. I like him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a stir in the camp. The captains came in a body and pleaded\r\nwith Capt. Ned not to do this rash thing. They promised that they would\r\ncreate a court composed of captains of the best character; they would\r\nempanel a jury; they would conduct everything in a way becoming the\r\nserious nature of the business in hand, and give the case an impartial\r\nhearing and the accused a fair trial. And they said it would be murder,\r\nand punishable by the American courts if he persisted and hung the\r\naccused on his ship. They pleaded hard. Capt. Ned said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I\xe2\x80\x99m not stubborn and I\xe2\x80\x99m not unreasonable. I\xe2\x80\x99m always\r\nwilling to do just as near right as I can. How long will it take?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably only a little while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can I take him up the shore and hang him as soon as you are done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_If_ he is proven guilty he shall be hanged without unnecessary delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s proven guilty. Great Neptune, _ain\xe2\x80\x99t_ he guilty? This beats my\r\ntime. Why you all _know_ he\xe2\x80\x99s guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at last they satisfied him that they were projecting nothing\r\nunderhanded. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, all right. You go on and try him and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go down and overhaul\r\nhis conscience and prepare him to go\xe2\x80\x94like enough he needs it, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to send him off without a show for hereafter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was another obstacle. They finally convinced him that it was\r\nnecessary to have the accused in court. Then they said they would send a\r\nguard to bring him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, I prefer to fetch him myself\xe2\x80\x94he don\xe2\x80\x99t get out of _my_ hands.\r\nBesides, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go to the ship to get a rope, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe court assembled with due ceremony, empaneled a jury, and presently\r\nCapt. Ned entered, leading the prisoner with one hand and carrying a\r\nBible and a rope in the other. He seated himself by the side of his\r\ncaptive and told the court to \xe2\x80\x9cup anchor and make sail.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he turned\r\na searching eye on the jury, and detected Noakes\xe2\x80\x99s friends, the two\r\nbullies.\r\n\r\nHe strode over and said to them confidentially:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re here to interfere, you see. Now you vote right, do you hear?\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nelse there\xe2\x80\x99ll be a double-barreled inquest here when this trial\xe2\x80\x99s off,\r\nand your remainders will go home in a couple of baskets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe caution was not without fruit. The jury was a unit\xe2\x80\x94the verdict.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuilty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCapt. Ned sprung to his feet and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome along\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re my meat _now_, my lad, anyway. Gentlemen you\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nyourselves proud. I invite you all to come and see that I do it all\r\nstraight. Follow me to the canyon, a mile above here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe court informed him that a sheriff had been appointed to do the\r\nhanging, and\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nCapt. Ned\xe2\x80\x99s patience was at an end. His wrath was boundless. The subject\r\nof a sheriff was judiciously dropped.\r\n\r\nWhen the crowd arrived at the canyon, Capt. Ned climbed a tree and\r\narranged the halter, then came down and noosed his man. He opened his\r\nBible, and laid aside his hat. Selecting a chapter at random, he read it\r\nthrough, in a deep bass voice and with sincere solemnity. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLad, you are about to go aloft and give an account of yourself; and the\r\nlighter a man\xe2\x80\x99s manifest is, as far as sin\xe2\x80\x99s concerned, the better for\r\nhim. Make a clean breast, man, and carry a log with you that\xe2\x80\x99ll bear\r\ninspection. You killed the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n358.jpg (61K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo reply. A long pause.\r\n\r\nThe captain read another chapter, pausing, from time to time, to impress\r\nthe effect. Then he talked an earnest, persuasive sermon to him, and\r\nended by repeating the question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you kill the nigger?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo reply\xe2\x80\x94other than a malignant scowl. The captain now read the first\r\nand second chapters of Genesis, with deep feeling\xe2\x80\x94paused a moment,\r\nclosed the book reverently, and said with a perceptible savor of\r\nsatisfaction:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere. Four chapters. There\xe2\x80\x99s few that would have took the pains with\r\nyou that I have.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he swung up the condemned, and made the rope fast; stood by and\r\ntimed him half an hour with his watch, and then delivered the body to\r\nthe court. A little after, as he stood contemplating the motionless\r\nfigure, a doubt came into his face; evidently he felt a twinge of\r\nconscience\xe2\x80\x94a misgiving\xe2\x80\x94and he said with a sigh:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, p\xe2\x80\x99raps I ought to burnt him, maybe. But I was trying to do for\r\nthe best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the history of this affair reached California (it was in the \xe2\x80\x9cearly\r\ndays\xe2\x80\x9d) it made a deal of talk, but did not diminish the captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npopularity in any degree. It increased it, indeed. California had a\r\npopulation then that \xe2\x80\x9cinflicted\xe2\x80\x9d justice after a fashion that was\r\nsimplicity and primitiveness itself, and could therefore admire\r\nappreciatively when the same fashion was followed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n359.jpg (38K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\n\r\nVice flourished luxuriantly during the hey-day of our \xe2\x80\x9cflush times.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nsaloons were overburdened with custom; so were the police courts, the\r\ngambling dens, the brothels and the jails\xe2\x80\x94unfailing signs of high\r\nprosperity in a mining region\xe2\x80\x94in any region for that matter. Is it not\r\nso? A crowded police court docket is the surest of all signs that trade\r\nis brisk and money plenty. Still, there is one other sign; it comes\r\nlast, but when it does come it establishes beyond cavil that the \xe2\x80\x9cflush\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x9d are at the flood. This is the birth of the \xe2\x80\x9cliterary\xe2\x80\x9d paper. The\r\nWeekly Occidental, \xe2\x80\x9cdevoted to literature,\xe2\x80\x9d made its appearance in\r\nVirginia. All the literary people were engaged to write for it. Mr. F.\r\nwas to edit it. He was a felicitous skirmisher with a pen, and a man who\r\ncould say happy things in a crisp, neat way. Once, while editor of the\r\n_Union_, he had disposed of a labored, incoherent, two-column attack\r\nmade upon him by a contemporary, with a single line, which, at first\r\nglance, seemed to contain a solemn and tremendous compliment\xe2\x80\x94viz.: \xe2\x80\x9cTHE\r\nLOGIC OF OUR ADVERSARY RESEMBLES THE PEACE OF GOD,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and left it to the\r\nreader\xe2\x80\x99s memory and after-thought to invest the remark with another and\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmore different\xe2\x80\x9d meaning by supplying for himself and at his own leisure\r\nthe rest of the Scripture\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c_in that it passeth understanding._\xe2\x80\x9d He once\r\nsaid of a little, half-starved, wayside community that had no\r\nsubsistence except what they could get by preying upon chance passengers\r\nwho stopped over with them a day when traveling by the overland stage,\r\nthat in their Church service they had altered the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer to read:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive us this day our daily stranger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe expected great things of the Occidental. Of course it could not get\r\nalong without an original novel, and so we made arrangements to hurl\r\ninto the work the full strength of the company. Mrs. F. was an able\r\nromancist of the ineffable school\xe2\x80\x94I know no other name to apply to a\r\nschool whose heroes are all dainty and all perfect. She wrote the\r\nopening chapter, and introduced a lovely blonde simpleton who talked\r\nnothing but pearls and poetry and who was virtuous to the verge of\r\neccentricity. She also introduced a young French Duke of aggravated\r\nrefinement, in love with the blonde. Mr. F. followed next week, with a\r\nbrilliant lawyer who set about getting the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s estates into trouble,\r\nand a sparkling young lady of high society who fell to fascinating the\r\nDuke and impairing the appetite of the blonde. Mr. D., a dark and bloody\r\neditor of one of the dailies, followed Mr. F., the third week,\r\nintroducing a mysterious Roscicrucian who transmuted metals, held\r\nconsultations with the devil in a cave at dead of night, and cast the\r\nhoroscope of the several heroes and heroines in such a way as to provide\r\nplenty of trouble for their future careers and breed a solemn and awful\r\npublic interest in the novel. He also introduced a cloaked and masked\r\nmelodramatic miscreant, put him on a salary and set him on the midnight\r\ntrack of the Duke with a poisoned dagger. He also created an Irish\r\ncoachman with a rich brogue and placed him in the service of the\r\nsociety-young-lady with an ulterior mission to carry billet-doux to the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n361.jpg (79K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time there arrived in Virginia a dissolute stranger with a\r\nliterary turn of mind\xe2\x80\x94rather seedy he was, but very quiet and\r\nunassuming; almost diffident, indeed. He was so gentle, and his manners\r\nwere so pleasing and kindly, whether he was sober or intoxicated, that\r\nhe made friends of all who came in contact with him. He applied for\r\nliterary work, offered conclusive evidence that he wielded an easy and\r\npracticed pen, and so Mr. F. engaged him at once to help write the\r\nnovel. His chapter was to follow Mr. D.\xe2\x80\x99s, and mine was to come next.\r\nNow what does this fellow do but go off and get drunk and then proceed\r\nto his quarters and set to work with his imagination in a state of\r\nchaos, and that chaos in a condition of extravagant activity. The result\r\nmay be guessed. He scanned the chapters of his predecessors, found\r\nplenty of heroes and heroines already created, and was satisfied with\r\nthem; he decided to introduce no more; with all the confidence that\r\nwhisky inspires and all the easy complacency it gives to its servant, he\r\nthen launched himself lovingly into his work: he married the coachman to\r\nthe society-young-lady for the sake of the scandal; married the Duke to\r\nthe blonde\xe2\x80\x99s stepmother, for the sake of the sensation; stopped the\r\ndesperado\xe2\x80\x99s salary; created a misunderstanding between the devil and the\r\nRoscicrucian; threw the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s property into the wicked lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s hands;\r\nmade the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s upbraiding conscience drive him to drink, thence to\r\ndelirium tremens, thence to suicide; broke the coachman\xe2\x80\x99s neck; let his\r\nwidow succumb to contumely, neglect, poverty and consumption; caused the\r\nblonde to drown herself, leaving her clothes on the bank with the\r\ncustomary note pinned to them forgiving the Duke and hoping he would be\r\nhappy; revealed to the Duke, by means of the usual strawberry mark on\r\nleft arm, that he had married his own long-lost mother and destroyed his\r\nlong-lost sister; instituted the proper and necessary suicide of the\r\nDuke and the Duchess in order to compass poetical justice; opened the\r\nearth and let the Roscicrucian through, accompanied with the accustomed\r\nsmoke and thunder and smell of brimstone, and finished with the promise\r\nthat in the next chapter, after holding a general inquest, he would take\r\nup the surviving character of the novel and tell what became of the\r\ndevil!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n362.jpg (39K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt read with singular smoothness, and with a \xe2\x80\x9cdead\xe2\x80\x9d earnestness that was\r\nfunny enough to suffocate a body. But there was war when it came in. The\r\nother novelists were furious. The mild stranger, not yet more than half\r\nsober, stood there, under a scathing fire of vituperation, meek and\r\nbewildered, looking from one to another of his assailants, and wondering\r\nwhat he could have done to invoke such a storm. When a lull came at\r\nlast, he said his say gently and appealingly\xe2\x80\x94said he did not rightly\r\nremember what he had written, but was sure he had tried to do the best\r\nhe could, and knew his object had been to make the novel not only\r\npleasant and plausible but instructive and\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe bombardment began again. The novelists assailed his ill-chosen\r\nadjectives and demolished them with a storm of denunciation and\r\nridicule. And so the siege went on. Every time the stranger tried to\r\nappease the enemy he only made matters worse. Finally he offered to\r\nrewrite the chapter. This arrested hostilities. The indignation\r\ngradually quieted down, peace reigned again and the sufferer retired in\r\nsafety and got him to his own citadel.\r\n\r\nBut on the way thither the evil angel tempted him and he got drunk\r\nagain. And again his imagination went mad. He led the heroes and\r\nheroines a wilder dance than ever; and yet all through it ran that same\r\nconvincing air of honesty and earnestness that had marked his first\r\nwork. He got the characters into the most extraordinary situations, put\r\nthem through the most surprising performances, and made them talk the\r\nstrangest talk! But the chapter cannot be described. It was\r\nsymmetrically crazy; it was artistically absurd; and it had explanatory\r\nfootnotes that were fully as curious as the text. I remember one of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csituations,\xe2\x80\x9d and will offer it as an example of the whole. He altered\r\nthe character of the brilliant lawyer, and made him a great-hearted,\r\nsplendid fellow; gave him fame and riches, and set his age at thirty-\r\nthree years. Then he made the blonde discover, through the help of the\r\nRoscicrucian and the melodramatic miscreant, that while the Duke loved\r\nher money ardently and wanted it, he secretly felt a sort of leaning\r\ntoward the society-young-lady. Stung to the quick, she tore her\r\naffections from him and bestowed them with tenfold power upon the\r\nlawyer, who responded with consuming zeal. But the parents would none of\r\nit. What they wanted in the family was a Duke; and a Duke they were\r\ndetermined to have; though they confessed that next to the Duke the\r\nlawyer had their preference. Necessarily the blonde now went into a\r\ndecline. The parents were alarmed. They pleaded with her to marry the\r\nDuke, but she steadfastly refused, and pined on. Then they laid a plan.\r\nThey told her to wait a year and a day, and if at the end of that time\r\nshe still felt that she could not marry the Duke, she might marry the\r\nlawyer with their full consent. The result was as they had foreseen:\r\ngladness came again, and the flush of returning health. Then the parents\r\ntook the next step in their scheme. They had the family physician\r\nrecommend a long sea voyage and much land travel for the thorough\r\nrestoration of the blonde\xe2\x80\x99s strength; and they invited the Duke to be of\r\nthe party. They judged that the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s constant presence and the\r\nlawyer\xe2\x80\x99s protracted absence would do the rest\xe2\x80\x94for they did not invite\r\nthe lawyer.\r\n\r\nSo they set sail in a steamer for America\xe2\x80\x94and the third day out, when\r\ntheir sea-sickness called truce and permitted them to take their first\r\nmeal at the public table, behold there sat the lawyer! The Duke and\r\nparty made the best of an awkward situation; the voyage progressed, and\r\nthe vessel neared America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n365.jpg (74K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, by and by, two hundred miles off New Bedford, the ship took fire;\r\nshe burned to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge; of all her crew and passengers, only\r\nthirty were saved. They floated about the sea half an afternoon and all\r\nnight long. Among them were our friends. The lawyer, by superhuman\r\nexertions, had saved the blonde and her parents, swimming back and forth\r\ntwo hundred yards and bringing one each time\xe2\x80\x94(the girl first). The Duke\r\nhad saved himself. In the morning two whale ships arrived on the scene\r\nand sent their boats. The weather was stormy and the embarkation was\r\nattended with much confusion and excitement. The lawyer did his duty\r\nlike a man; helped his exhausted and insensible blonde, her parents and\r\nsome others into a boat (the Duke helped himself in); then a child fell\r\noverboard at the other end of the raft and the lawyer rushed thither and\r\nhelped half a dozen people fish it out, under the stimulus of its\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s screams. Then he ran back\xe2\x80\x94a few seconds too late\xe2\x80\x94the blonde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboat was under way. So he had to take the other boat, and go to the\r\nother ship. The storm increased and drove the vessels out of sight of\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x94drove them whither it would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n366.jpg (83K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it calmed, at the end of three days, the blonde\xe2\x80\x99s ship was seven\r\nhundred miles north of Boston and the other about seven hundred south of\r\nthat port. The blonde\xe2\x80\x99s captain was bound on a whaling cruise in the\r\nNorth Atlantic and could not go back such a distance or make a port\r\nwithout orders; such being nautical law. The lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s captain was to\r\ncruise in the North Pacific, and _he_ could not go back or make a port\r\nwithout orders. All the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s money and baggage were in the blonde\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nboat and went to the blonde\xe2\x80\x99s ship\xe2\x80\x94so his captain made him work his\r\npassage as a common sailor. When both ships had been cruising nearly a\r\nyear, the one was off the coast of Greenland and the other in Behring\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nStrait. The blonde had long ago been well-nigh persuaded that her lawyer\r\nhad been washed overboard and lost just before the whale ships reached\r\nthe raft, and now, under the pleadings of her parents and the Duke she\r\nwas at last beginning to nerve herself for the doom of the covenant, and\r\nprepare for the hated marriage.\r\n\r\nBut she would not yield a day before the date set. The weeks dragged on,\r\nthe time narrowed, orders were given to deck the ship for the wedding\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwedding at sea among icebergs and walruses. Five days more and all would\r\nbe over. So the blonde reflected, with a sigh and a tear. Oh where was\r\nher true love\xe2\x80\x94and why, why did he not come and save her? At that moment\r\nhe was lifting his harpoon to strike a whale in Behring\xe2\x80\x99s Strait, five\r\nthousand miles away, by the way of the Arctic Ocean, or twenty thousand\r\nby the way of the Horn\xe2\x80\x94that was the reason. He struck, but not with\r\nperfect aim\xe2\x80\x94his foot slipped and he fell in the whale\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and went\r\ndown his throat. He was insensible five days. Then he came to himself\r\nand heard voices; daylight was streaming through a hole cut in the\r\nwhale\xe2\x80\x99s roof. He climbed out and astonished the sailors who were\r\nhoisting blubber up a ship\xe2\x80\x99s side. He recognized the vessel, flew\r\naboard, surprised the wedding party at the altar and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop the proceedings\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m here! Come to my arms, my own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n367.jpg (88K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were foot-notes to this extravagant piece of literature wherein\r\nthe author endeavored to show that the whole thing was within the\r\npossibilities; he said he got the incident of the whale traveling from\r\nBehring\xe2\x80\x99s Strait to the coast of Greenland, five thousand miles in five\r\ndays, through the Arctic Ocean, from Charles Reade\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLove Me Little\r\nLove Me Long,\xe2\x80\x9d and considered that that established the fact that the\r\nthing could be done; and he instanced Jonah\xe2\x80\x99s adventure as proof that a\r\nman could live in a whale\xe2\x80\x99s belly, and added that if a preacher could\r\nstand it three days a lawyer could surely stand it five!\r\n\r\nThere was a fiercer storm than ever in the editorial sanctum now, and\r\nthe stranger was peremptorily discharged, and his manuscript flung at\r\nhis head. But he had already delayed things so much that there was not\r\ntime for some one else to rewrite the chapter, and so the paper came out\r\nwithout any novel in it. It was but a feeble, struggling, stupid\r\njournal, and the absence of the novel probably shook public confidence;\r\nat any rate, before the first side of the next issue went to press, the\r\nWeekly Occidental died as peacefully as an infant.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made to resurrect it, with the proposed advantage of a\r\ntelling new title, and Mr. F. said that The _Phenix_ would be just the\r\nname for it, because it would give the idea of a resurrection from its\r\ndead ashes in a new and undreamed of condition of splendor; but some\r\nlow- priced smarty on one of the dailies suggested that we call it the\r\n_Lazarus_; and inasmuch as the people were not profound in Scriptural\r\nmatters but thought the resurrected Lazarus and the dilapidated\r\nmendicant that begged in the rich man\xe2\x80\x99s gateway were one and the same\r\nperson, the name became the laughing stock of the town, and killed the\r\npaper for good and all.\r\n\r\nI was sorry enough, for I was very proud of being connected with a\r\nliterary paper\xe2\x80\x94prouder than I have ever been of anything since, perhaps.\r\nI had written some rhymes for it\xe2\x80\x94poetry I considered it\xe2\x80\x94and it was a\r\ngreat grief to me that the production was on the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst side\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nissue that was not completed, and hence did not see the light. But time\r\nbrings its revenges\xe2\x80\x94I can put it in here; it will answer in place of a\r\ntear dropped to the memory of the lost Occidental. The idea (not the\r\nchief idea, but the vehicle that bears it) was probably suggested by the\r\nold song called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Raging Canal,\xe2\x80\x9d but I cannot remember now. I do\r\nremember, though, that at that time I thought my doggerel was one of the\r\nablest poems of the age: THE AGED PILOT MAN.\r\n\r\nOn the Erie Canal, it was, All on a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day, I sailed forth with my\r\nparents Far away to Albany.\r\n\r\nFrom out the clouds at noon that day There came a dreadful storm, That\r\npiled the billows high about, And filled us with alarm.\r\n\r\nA man came rushing from a house, Saying, \xe2\x80\x98Snub up your boat I pray, [The\r\ncustomary canal technicality for \xe2\x80\x9dtie up.\xe2\x80\x9c] Snub up your boat, snub up,\r\nalas, Snub up while yet you may.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOur captain cast one glance astern, Then forward glanc\xc3\xa8d he, And said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife and little ones I never more shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaid Dollinger the pilot man, In noble words, but few,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cFear not, but\r\nlean on Dollinger, And he will fetch you through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n370.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat drove on, the frightened mules Tore through the rain and wind,\r\nAnd bravely still, in danger\xe2\x80\x99s post, The whip-boy strode behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome \xe2\x80\x99board, come \xe2\x80\x99board,\xe2\x80\x9d the captain cried, \xe2\x80\x9cNor tempt so wild a\r\nstorm;\xe2\x80\x9d But still the raging mules advanced, And still the boy strode\r\non.\r\n\r\nThen said the captain to us all, \xe2\x80\x9cAlas, \xe2\x80\x99tis plain to me, The greater\r\ndanger is not there, But here upon the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo let us strive, while life remains, To save all souls on board, And\r\nthen if die at last we must, Let .  .  .  .

The year 1863 was perhaps the very top blossom and culmination\r\nof the \xe2\x80\x9cflush times.\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia swarmed with men and vehicles to that\r\ndegree that the place looked like a very hive\xe2\x80\x94that is when one\xe2\x80\x99s vision\r\ncould pierce through the thick fog of alkali dust that was generally\r\nblowing in summer. I will say, concerning this dust, that if you drove\r\nten miles through it, you and your horses would be coated with it a\r\nsixteenth of an inch thick and present an outside appearance that was a\r\nuniform pale yellow color, and your buggy would have three inches of\r\ndust in it, thrown there by the wheels. The delicate scales used by the\r\nassayers were inclosed in glass cases intended to be air-tight, and yet\r\nsome of this dust was so impalpable and so invisibly fine that it would\r\nget in, somehow, and impair the accuracy of those scales.\r\n\r\nSpeculation ran riot, and yet there was a world of substantial business\r\ngoing on, too. All freights were brought over the mountains from\r\nCalifornia (150 miles) by pack-train partly, and partly in huge wagons\r\ndrawn by such long mule teams that each team amounted to a procession,\r\nand it did seem, sometimes, that the grand combined procession of\r\nanimals stretched unbroken from Virginia to California. Its long route\r\nwas traceable clear across the deserts of the Territory by the writhing\r\nserpent of dust it lifted up. By these wagons, freights over that\r\nhundred and fifty miles were $200 a ton for small lots (same price for\r\nall express matter brought by stage), and $100 a ton for full loads. One\r\nVirginia firm received one hundred tons of freight a month, and paid\r\n$10,000 a month freightage. In the winter the freights were much higher.\r\nAll the bullion was shipped in bars by stage to San Francisco (a bar was\r\nusually about twice the size of a pig of lead and contained from $1,500\r\nto $3,000 according to the amount of gold mixed with the silver), and\r\nthe freight on it (when the shipment was large) was one and a quarter\r\nper cent. of its intrinsic value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n377.jpg (16K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the freight on these bars probably averaged something more than $25\r\neach. Small shippers paid two per cent. There were three stages a day,\r\neach way, and I have seen the out-going stages carry away a third of a\r\nton of bullion each, and more than once I saw them divide a two-ton lot\r\nand take it off. However, these were extraordinary events. [Mr.\r\nValentine, Wells Fargo\xe2\x80\x99s agent, has handled all the bullion shipped\r\nthrough the Virginia office for many a month. To his memory\xe2\x80\x94which is\r\nexcellent\xe2\x80\x94we are indebted for the following exhibit of the company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbusiness in the Virginia office since the first of January, 1862: From\r\nJanuary 1st to April 1st, about $270,000 worth of bullion passed through\r\nthat office, during the next quarter, $570,000; next quarter, $800,000;\r\nnext quarter, $956,000; next quarter, $1,275,000; and for the quarter\r\nending on the 30th of last June, about $1,600,000. Thus in a year and a\r\nhalf, the Virginia office only shipped $5,330,000 in bullion. During the\r\nyear 1862 they shipped $2,615,000, so we perceive the average shipments\r\nhave more than doubled in the last six months. This gives us room to\r\npromise for the Virginia office $500,000 a month for the year 1863\r\n(though perhaps, judging by the steady increase in the business, we are\r\nunder estimating, somewhat). This gives us $6,000,000 for the year. Gold\r\nHill and Silver City together can beat us\xe2\x80\x94we will give them $10,000,000.\r\nTo Dayton, Empire City, Ophir and Carson City, we will allow an\r\naggregate of $8,000,000, which is not over the mark, perhaps, and may\r\npossibly be a little under it. To Esmeralda we give $4,000,000. To Reese\r\nRiver and Humboldt $2,000,000, which is liberal now, but may not be\r\nbefore the year is out. So we prognosticate that the yield of bullion\r\nthis year will be about $30,000,000. Placing the number of mills in the\r\nTerritory at one hundred, this gives to each the labor of producing\r\n$300,000 in bullion during the twelve months. Allowing them to run three\r\nhundred days in the year (which none of them more than do), this makes\r\ntheir work average $1,000 a day. Say the mills average twenty tons of\r\nrock a day and this rock worth $50 as a general thing, and you have the\r\nactual work of our one hundred mills figured down \xe2\x80\x9cto a spot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94$1,000 a\r\nday each, and $30,000,000 a year in the aggregate.\xe2\x80\x94_Enterprise_. [A\r\nconsiderable over estimate\xe2\x80\x94M. T.]]\r\n\r\nTwo tons of silver bullion would be in the neighborhood of forty bars,\r\nand the freight on it over $1,000. Each coach always carried a deal of\r\nordinary express matter beside, and also from fifteen to twenty\r\npassengers at from $25 to $30 a head. With six stages going all the\r\ntime, Wells, Fargo and Co.\xe2\x80\x99s Virginia City business was important and\r\nlucrative.\r\n\r\nAll along under the centre of Virginia and Gold Hill, for a couple of\r\nmiles, ran the great Comstock silver lode\xe2\x80\x94a vein of ore from fifty to\r\n_eighty_ feet thick between its solid walls of rock\xe2\x80\x94a vein as wide as\r\nsome of New York\xe2\x80\x99s streets. I will remind the reader that in\r\nPennsylvania a coal vein only eight feet wide is considered ample.\r\n\r\nVirginia was a busy city of streets and houses above ground. Under it\r\nwas another busy city, down in the bowels of the earth, where a great\r\npopulation of men thronged in and out among an intricate maze of tunnels\r\nand drifts, flitting hither and thither under a winking sparkle of\r\nlights, and over their heads towered a vast web of interlocking timbers\r\nthat held the walls of the gutted Comstock apart. These timbers were as\r\nlarge as a man\xe2\x80\x99s body, and the framework stretched upward so far that no\r\neye could pierce to its top through the closing gloom. It was like\r\npeering up through the clean-picked ribs and bones of some colossal\r\nskeleton. Imagine such a framework two miles long, sixty feet wide, and\r\nhigher than any church spire in America. Imagine this stately lattice-\r\nwork stretching down Broadway, from the St. Nicholas to Wall street, and\r\na Fourth of July procession, reduced to pigmies, parading on top of it\r\nand flaunting their flags, high above the pinnacle of Trinity steeple.\r\nOne can imagine that, but he cannot well imagine what that forest of\r\ntimbers cost, from the time they were felled in the pineries beyond\r\nWashoe Lake, hauled up and around Mount Davidson at atrocious rates of\r\nfreightage, then squared, let down into the deep maw of the mine and\r\nbuilt up there. Twenty ample fortunes would not timber one of the\r\ngreatest of those silver mines. The Spanish proverb says it requires a\r\ngold mine to \xe2\x80\x9crun\xe2\x80\x9d a silver one, and it is true. A beggar with a silver\r\nmine is a pitiable pauper indeed if he cannot sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n379.jpg (47K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI spoke of the underground Virginia as a city. The Gould and Curry is\r\nonly one single mine under there, among a great many others; yet the\r\nGould and Curry\xe2\x80\x99s streets of dismal drifts and tunnels were five miles\r\nin extent, altogether, and its population five hundred miners. Taken as\r\na whole, the underground city had some thirty miles of streets and a\r\npopulation of five or six thousand. In this present day some of those\r\npopulations are at work from twelve to sixteen hundred feet under\r\nVirginia and Gold Hill, and the signal-bells that tell them what the\r\nsuperintendent above ground desires them to do are struck by telegraph\r\nas we strike a fire alarm. Sometimes men fall down a shaft, there, a\r\nthousand feet deep. In such cases, the usual plan is to hold an inquest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n380.jpg (161K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish to visit one of those mines, you may walk through a tunnel\r\nabout half a mile long if you prefer it, or you may take the quicker\r\nplan of shooting like a dart down a shaft, on a small platform. It is\r\nlike tumbling down through an empty steeple, feet first. When you reach\r\nthe bottom, you take a candle and tramp through drifts and tunnels where\r\nthrongs of men are digging and blasting; you watch them send up tubs\r\nfull of great lumps of stone\xe2\x80\x94silver ore; you select choice specimens\r\nfrom the mass, as souvenirs; you admire the world of skeleton timbering;\r\nyou reflect frequently that you are buried under a mountain, a thousand\r\nfeet below daylight; being in the bottom of the mine you climb from\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgallery\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cgallery,\xe2\x80\x9d up endless ladders that stand straight up and\r\ndown; when your legs fail you at last, you lie down in a small box-car\r\nin a cramped \xe2\x80\x9cincline\xe2\x80\x9d like a half-up-ended sewer and are dragged up to\r\ndaylight feeling as if you are crawling through a coffin that has no end\r\nto it. Arrived at the top, you find a busy crowd of men receiving the\r\nascending cars and tubs and dumping the ore from an elevation into long\r\nrows of bins capable of holding half a dozen tons each; under the bins\r\nare rows of wagons loading from chutes and trap-doors in the bins, and\r\ndown the long street is a procession of these wagons wending toward the\r\nsilver mills with their rich freight. It is all \xe2\x80\x9cdone,\xe2\x80\x9d now, and there\r\nyou are. You need never go down again, for you have seen it all. If you\r\nhave forgotten the process of reducing the ore in the mill and making\r\nthe silver bars, you can go back and find it again in my Esmeralda\r\nchapters if so disposed.\r\n\r\nOf course these mines cave in, in places, occasionally, and then it is\r\nworth one\xe2\x80\x99s while to take the risk of descending into them and observing\r\nthe crushing power exerted by the pressing weight of a settling\r\nmountain. I published such an experience in the Enterprise, once, and\r\nfrom it I will take an extract:\r\n\r\nAN HOUR IN THE CAVED MINES.\xe2\x80\x94We journeyed down into the Ophir mine,\r\nyesterday, to see the earthquake. We could not go down the deep incline,\r\nbecause it still has a propensity to cave in places. Therefore we\r\ntraveled through the long tunnel which enters the hill above the Ophir\r\noffice, and then by means of a series of long ladders, climbed away down\r\nfrom the first to the fourth gallery. Traversing a drift, we came to the\r\nSpanish line, passed five sets of timbers still uninjured, and found the\r\nearthquake. Here was as complete a chaos as ever was seen\xe2\x80\x94vast masses of\r\nearth and splintered and broken timbers piled confusedly together, with\r\nscarcely an aperture left large enough for a cat to creep through.\r\nRubbish was still falling at intervals from above, and one timber which\r\nhad braced others earlier in the day, was now crushed down out of its\r\nformer position, showing that the caving and settling of the tremendous\r\nmass was still going on. We were in that portion of the Ophir known as\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cnorth mines.\xe2\x80\x9d Returning to the surface, we entered a tunnel leading\r\ninto the Central, for the purpose of getting into the main Ophir.\r\nDescending a long incline in this tunnel, we traversed a drift or so,\r\nand then went down a deep shaft from whence we proceeded into the fifth\r\ngallery of the Ophir. From a side-drift we crawled through a small hole\r\nand got into the midst of the earthquake again\xe2\x80\x94earth and broken timbers\r\nmingled together without regard to grace or symmetry. A large portion of\r\nthe second, third and fourth galleries had caved in and gone to\r\ndestruction\xe2\x80\x94the two latter at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the previous evening.\r\n\r\nAt the turn-table, near the northern extremity of the fifth gallery, two\r\nbig piles of rubbish had forced their way through from the fifth\r\ngallery, and from the looks of the timbers, more was about to come.\r\nThese beams are solid\xe2\x80\x94eighteen inches square; first, a great beam is\r\nlaid on the floor, then upright ones, five feet high, stand on it,\r\nsupporting another horizontal beam, and so on, square above square, like\r\nthe framework of a window. The superincumbent weight was sufficient to\r\nmash the ends of those great upright beams fairly into the solid wood of\r\nthe horizontal ones three inches, compressing and bending the upright\r\nbeam till it curved like a bow. Before the Spanish caved in, some of\r\ntheir twelve-inch horizontal timbers were compressed in this way until\r\nthey were only five inches thick! Imagine the power it must take to\r\nsqueeze a solid log together in that way. Here, also, was a range of\r\ntimbers, for a distance of twenty feet, tilted six inches out of the\r\nperpendicular by the weight resting upon them from the caved galleries\r\nabove. You could hear things cracking and giving way, and it was not\r\npleasant to know that the world overhead was slowly and silently sinking\r\ndown upon you. The men down in the mine do not mind it, however.\r\n\r\nReturning along the fifth gallery, we struck the safe part of the Ophir\r\nincline, and went down it to the sixth; but we found ten inches of water\r\nthere, and had to come back. In repairing the damage done to the\r\nincline, the pump had to be stopped for two hours, and in the meantime\r\nthe water gained about a foot. However, the pump was at work again, and\r\nthe flood-water was decreasing. We climbed up to the fifth gallery again\r\nand sought a deep shaft, whereby we might descend to another part of the\r\nsixth, out of reach of the water, but suffered disappointment, as the\r\nmen had gone to dinner, and there was no one to man the windlass. So,\r\nhaving seen the earthquake, we climbed out at the _Union_ incline and\r\ntunnel, and adjourned, all dripping with candle grease and perspiration,\r\nto lunch at the Ophir office.\r\n\r\nDuring the great flush year of 1863, Nevada [claims to have] produced\r\n$25,000,000 in bullion\xe2\x80\x94almost, if not quite, a round million to each\r\nthousand inhabitants, which is very well, considering that she was\r\nwithout agriculture and manufactures. Silver mining was her sole\r\nproductive industry.\r\n\r\n[Since the above was in type, I learn from an official source that the\r\nabove figure is too high, and that the yield for 1863 did not exceed\r\n$20,000,000.] However, the day for large figures is approaching; the\r\nSutro Tunnel is to plow through the Comstock lode from end to end, at a\r\ndepth of two thousand feet, and then mining will be easy and\r\ncomparatively inexpensive; and the momentous matters of drainage, and\r\nhoisting and hauling of ore will cease to be burdensome. This vast work\r\nwill absorb many years, and millions of dollars, in its completion; but\r\nit will early yield money, for that desirable epoch will begin as soon\r\nas it strikes the first end of the vein. The tunnel will be some eight\r\nmiles long, and will develop astonishing riches. Cars will carry the ore\r\nthrough the tunnel and dump it in the mills and thus do away with the\r\npresent costly system of double handling and transportation by mule\r\nteams. The water from the tunnel will furnish the motive power for the\r\nmills. Mr. Sutro, the originator of this prodigious enterprise, is one\r\nof the few men in the world who is gifted with the pluck and\r\nperseverance necessary to follow up and hound such an undertaking to its\r\ncompletion. He has converted several obstinate Congresses to a deserved\r\nfriendliness toward his important work, and has gone up and down and to\r\nand fro in Europe until he has enlisted a great moneyed interest in it\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, in these days, the boys used to tell me I ought to\r\nget one Jim Blaine to tell me the stirring story of his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nold ram\xe2\x80\x94but they always added that I must not mention the matter unless\r\nJim was drunk at the time\xe2\x80\x94just comfortably and sociably drunk. They kept\r\nthis up until my curiosity was on the rack to hear the story. I got to\r\nhaunting Blaine; but it was of no use, the boys always found fault with\r\nhis condition; he was often moderately but never satisfactorily drunk. I\r\nnever watched a man\xe2\x80\x99s condition with such absorbing interest, such\r\nanxious solicitude; I never so pined to see a man uncompromisingly drunk\r\nbefore. At last, one evening I hurried to his cabin, for I learned that\r\nthis time his situation was such that even the most fastidious could\r\nfind no fault with it\xe2\x80\x94he was tranquilly, serenely, symmetrically\r\ndrunk\xe2\x80\x94not a hiccup to mar his voice, not a cloud upon his brain thick\r\nenough to obscure his memory. As I entered, he was sitting upon an empty\r\npowder-keg, with a clay pipe in one hand and the other raised to command\r\nsilence. His face was round, red, and very serious; his throat was bare\r\nand his hair tumbled; in general appearance and costume he was a\r\nstalwart miner of the period. On the pine table stood a candle, and its\r\ndim light revealed \xe2\x80\x9cthe boys\xe2\x80\x9d sitting here and there on bunks, candle-\r\nboxes, powder-kegs, etc. They said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh\xe2\x80\x94! Don\xe2\x80\x99t speak\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s going to commence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n384.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE OLD RAM.\r\n\r\nI found a seat at once, and Blaine said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t reckon them times will ever come again. There never was a more\r\nbullier old ram than what he was. Grandfather fetched him from\r\nIllinois\xe2\x80\x94got him of a man by the name of Yates\xe2\x80\x94Bill Yates\xe2\x80\x94maybe you\r\nmight have heard of him; his father was a deacon\xe2\x80\x94Baptist\xe2\x80\x94and he was a\r\nrustler, too; a man had to get up ruther early to get the start of old\r\nThankful Yates; it was him that put the Greens up to jining teams with\r\nmy grandfather when he moved west.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seth Green was prob\xe2\x80\x99ly the pick of the flock; he married a\r\nWilkerson\xe2\x80\x94Sarah Wilkerson\xe2\x80\x94good cretur, she was\xe2\x80\x94one of the likeliest\r\nheifers that was ever raised in old Stoddard, everybody said that knowed\r\nher. She could heft a bar\xe2\x80\x99l of flour as easy as I can flirt a flapjack.\r\nAnd spin? Don\xe2\x80\x99t mention it! Independent? Humph! When Sile Hawkins come a\r\nbrowsing around her, she let him know that for all his tin he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrot in harness alongside of _her_. You see, Sile Hawkins was\xe2\x80\x94no, it\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t Sile Hawkins, after all\xe2\x80\x94it was a galoot by the name of Filkins\xe2\x80\x94I\r\ndisremember his first name; but he _was_ a stump\xe2\x80\x94come into pra\xe2\x80\x99r meeting\r\ndrunk, one night, hooraying for Nixon, becuz he thought it was a\r\nprimary; and old deacon Ferguson up and scooted him through the window\r\nand he lit on old Miss Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s head, poor old filly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n385.jpg (52K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was a good soul\xe2\x80\x94had a glass eye and used to lend it to old Miss\r\nWagner, that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t any, to receive company in; it warn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough,\r\nand when Miss Wagner warn\xe2\x80\x99t noticing, it would get twisted around in the\r\nsocket, and look up, maybe, or out to one side, and every which way,\r\nwhile t\xe2\x80\x99 other one was looking as straight ahead as a spy-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrown people didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, but it most always made the children cry,\r\nit was so sort of scary. She tried packing it in raw cotton, but it\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work, somehow\xe2\x80\x94the cotton would get loose and stick out and look\r\nso kind of awful that the children couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand it no way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n386.jpg (26K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was always dropping it out, and turning up her old dead-light on the\r\ncompany empty, and making them oncomfortable, becuz _she_ never could\r\ntell when it hopped out, being blind on that side, you see. So somebody\r\nwould have to hunch her and say, \xe2\x80\x9cYour game eye has fetched loose. Miss\r\nWagner dear\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and then all of them would have to sit and wait till she\r\njammed it in again\xe2\x80\x94wrong side before, as a general thing, and green as a\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s egg, being a bashful cretur and easy sot back before company. But\r\nbeing wrong side before warn\xe2\x80\x99t much difference, anyway; becuz her own\r\neye was sky-blue and the glass one was yaller on the front side, so\r\nwhichever way she turned it it didn\xe2\x80\x99t match nohow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Old Miss Wagner was considerable on the borrow, she was. When she had a\r\nquilting, or Dorcas S\xe2\x80\x99iety at her house she gen\xe2\x80\x99ally borrowed Miss\r\nHiggins\xe2\x80\x99s wooden leg to stump around on; it was considerable shorter\r\nthan her other pin, but much _she_ minded that. She said she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nabide crutches when she had company, becuz they were so slow; said when\r\nshe had company and things had to be done, she wanted to get up and hump\r\nherself. She was as bald as a jug, and so she used to borrow Miss\r\nJacops\xe2\x80\x99s wig\xe2\x80\x94Miss Jacops was the coffin-peddler\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x94a ratty old\r\nbuzzard, he was, that used to go roosting around where people was sick,\r\nwaiting for \xe2\x80\x99em; and there that old rip would sit all day, in the shade,\r\non a coffin that he judged would fit the can\xe2\x80\x99idate; and if it was a slow\r\ncustomer and kind of uncertain, he\xe2\x80\x99d fetch his rations and a blanket\r\nalong and sleep in the coffin nights. He was anchored out that way, in\r\nfrosty weather, for about three weeks, once, before old Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s place,\r\nwaiting for him; and after that, for as much as two years, Jacops was\r\nnot on speaking terms with the old man, on account of his disapp\xe2\x80\x99inting\r\nhim. He got one of his feet froze, and lost money, too, becuz old\r\nRobbins took a favorable turn and got well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n387.jpg (61K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next time Robbins got sick, Jacops tried to make up with him, and\r\nvarnished up the same old coffin and fetched it along; but old Robbins\r\nwas too many for him; he had him in, and \xe2\x80\x99peared to be powerful weak; he\r\nbought the coffin for ten dollars and Jacops was to pay it back and\r\ntwenty-five more besides if Robbins didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the coffin after he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ntried it. And then Robbins died, and at the funeral he bursted off the\r\nlid and riz up in his shroud and told the parson to let up on the\r\nperformances, becuz he could _not_ stand such a coffin as that. You see\r\nhe had been in a trance once before, when he was young, and he took the\r\nchances on another, cal\xe2\x80\x99lating that if he made the trip it was money in\r\nhis pocket, and if he missed fire he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose a cent. And by George\r\nhe sued Jacops for the rhino and got jedgment; and he set up the coffin\r\nin his back parlor and said he \xe2\x80\x99lowed to take his time, now. It was\r\nalways an aggravation to Jacops, the way that miserable old thing acted.\r\nHe moved back to Indiany pretty soon\xe2\x80\x94went to Wellsville\xe2\x80\x94Wellsville was\r\nthe place the Hogadorns was from. Mighty fine family. Old Maryland\r\nstock. Old Squire Hogadorn could carry around more mixed licker, and\r\ncuss better than most any man I ever see. His second wife was the widder\r\nBillings\xe2\x80\x94she that was Becky Martin; her dam was deacon Dunlap\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nwife. Her oldest child, Maria, married a missionary and died in grace\xe2\x80\x94et\r\nup by the savages. They et _him_, too, poor feller\xe2\x80\x94biled him. It warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe custom, so they say, but they explained to friends of his\xe2\x80\x99n that\r\nwent down there to bring away his things, that they\xe2\x80\x99d tried missionaries\r\nevery other way and never could get any good out of \xe2\x80\x99em\xe2\x80\x94and so it\r\nannoyed all his relations to find out that that man\xe2\x80\x99s life was fooled\r\naway just out of a dern\xe2\x80\x99d experiment, so to speak. But mind you, there\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t anything ever reely lost; everything that people can\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t see the reason of does good if you only hold on and give it a\r\nfair shake; Prov\xe2\x80\x99dence don\xe2\x80\x99t fire no blank ca\xe2\x80\x99tridges, boys. That there\r\nmissionary\xe2\x80\x99s substance, unbeknowns to himself, actu\xe2\x80\x99ly converted every\r\nlast one of them heathens that took a chance at the barbacue. Nothing\r\never fetched them but that. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell _me_ it was an accident that he\r\nwas biled. There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no such a thing as an accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n388.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When my uncle Lem was leaning up agin a scaffolding once, sick, or\r\ndrunk, or suthin, an Irishman with a hod full of bricks fell on him out\r\nof the third story and broke the old man\xe2\x80\x99s back in two places. People\r\nsaid it was an accident. Much accident there was about that. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what he was there for, but he was there for a good object. If he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t been there the Irishman would have been killed. Nobody can ever\r\nmake me believe anything different from that. Uncle Lem\xe2\x80\x99s dog was there.\r\nWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t the Irishman fall on the dog? Becuz the dog would a seen him\r\na coming and stood from under. That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason the dog warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nappinted. A dog can\xe2\x80\x99t be depended on to carry out a special providence.\r\nMark my words it was a put-up thing. Accidents don\xe2\x80\x99t happen, boys. Uncle\r\nLem\xe2\x80\x99s dog\xe2\x80\x94I wish you could a seen that dog. He was a reglar shepherd\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nruther he was part bull and part shepherd\xe2\x80\x94splendid animal; belonged to\r\nparson Hagar before Uncle Lem got him. Parson Hagar belonged to the\r\nWestern Reserve Hagars; prime family; his mother was a Watson; one of\r\nhis sisters married a Wheeler; they settled in Morgan county, and he got\r\nnipped by the machinery in a carpet factory and went through in less\r\nthan a quarter of a minute; his widder bought the piece of carpet that\r\nhad his remains wove in, and people come a hundred mile to \xe2\x80\x99tend the\r\nfuneral. There was fourteen yards in the piece.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let them roll him up, but planted him just so\xe2\x80\x94full length.\r\nThe church was middling small where they preached the funeral, and they\r\nhad to let one end of the coffin stick out of the window. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbury him\xe2\x80\x94they planted one end, and let him stand up, same as a monument.\r\nAnd they nailed a sign on it and put\xe2\x80\x94put on\xe2\x80\x94put on it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csacred to\xe2\x80\x94the m-\r\ne-m-o-r-y\xe2\x80\x94of fourteen y-a-r-d-s\xe2\x80\x94of three-ply\xe2\x80\x94car\xe2\x80\x94-pet\xe2\x80\x94containing all\r\nthat was\xe2\x80\x94m-o-r-t-a-l\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94W-i-l-l-i-a-m\xe2\x80\x94W-h-e\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n389.jpg (111K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJim Blaine had been growing gradually drowsy and drowsier\xe2\x80\x94his head\r\nnodded, once, twice, three times\xe2\x80\x94dropped peacefully upon his breast, and\r\nhe fell tranquilly asleep. The tears were running down the boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncheeks\xe2\x80\x94they were suffocating with suppressed laughter\xe2\x80\x94and had been from\r\nthe start, though I had never noticed it. I perceived that I was \xe2\x80\x9csold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nI learned then that Jim Blaine\xe2\x80\x99s peculiarity was that whenever he\r\nreached a certain stage of intoxication, no human power could keep him\r\nfrom setting out, with impressive unction, to tell about a wonderful\r\nadventure which he had once had with his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s old ram\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nmention of the ram in the first sentence was as far as any man had ever\r\nheard him get, concerning it. He always maundered off, interminably,\r\nfrom one thing to another, till his whisky got the best of him and he\r\nfell asleep. What the thing was that happened to him and his\r\ngrandfather\xe2\x80\x99s old ram is a dark mystery to this day, for nobody has ever\r\nyet found out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n390.jpg (64K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course there was a large Chinese population in Virginia\xe2\x80\x94it is the\r\ncase with every town and city on the Pacific coast. They are a harmless\r\nrace when white men either let them alone or treat them no worse than\r\ndogs; in fact they are almost entirely harmless anyhow, for they seldom\r\nthink of resenting the vilest insults or the cruelest injuries. They are\r\nquiet, peaceable, tractable, free from drunkenness, and they are as\r\nindustrious as the day is long. A disorderly Chinaman is rare, and a\r\nlazy one does not exist. So long as a Chinaman has strength to use his\r\nhands he needs no support from anybody; white men often complain of want\r\nof work, but a Chinaman offers no such complaint; he always manages to\r\nfind something to do. He is a great convenience to everybody\xe2\x80\x94even to the\r\nworst class of white men, for he bears the most of their sins, suffering\r\nfines for their petty thefts, imprisonment for their robberies, and\r\ndeath for their murders. Any white man can swear a Chinaman\xe2\x80\x99s life away\r\nin the courts, but no Chinaman can testify against a white man. Ours is\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cland of the free\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94nobody denies that\xe2\x80\x94nobody challenges it. [Maybe\r\nit is because we won\xe2\x80\x99t let other people testify.] As I write, news comes\r\nthat in broad daylight in San Francisco, some boys have stoned an\r\ninoffensive Chinaman to death, and that although a large crowd witnessed\r\nthe shameful deed, no one interfered.\r\n\r\nThere are seventy thousand (and possibly one hundred thousand) Chinamen\r\non the Pacific coast. There were about a thousand in Virginia. They were\r\npenned into a \xe2\x80\x9cChinese quarter\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a thing which they do not particularly\r\nobject to, as they are fond of herding together. Their buildings were of\r\nwood; usually only one story high, and set thickly together along\r\nstreets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass through. Their quarter\r\nwas a little removed from the rest of the town. The chief employment of\r\nChinamen in towns is to wash clothing. They always send a bill, like\r\nthis below, pinned to the clothes. It is mere ceremony, for it does not\r\nenlighten the customer much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n392.jpg (12K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir price for washing was $2.50 per dozen\xe2\x80\x94rather cheaper than white\r\npeople could afford to wash for at that time. A very common sign on the\r\nChinese houses was: \xe2\x80\x9cSee Yup, Washer and Ironer\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cHong Wo, Washer\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSam Sing & Ah Hop, Washing.\xe2\x80\x9d The house servants, cooks, etc., in\r\nCalifornia and Nevada, were chiefly Chinamen. There were few white\r\nservants and no Chinawomen so employed. Chinamen make good house\r\nservants, being quick, obedient, patient, quick to learn and tirelessly\r\nindustrious. They do not need to be taught a thing twice, as a general\r\nthing. They are imitative. If a Chinaman were to see his master break up\r\na centre table, in a passion, and kindle a fire with it, that Chinaman\r\nwould be likely to resort to the furniture for fuel forever afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n393.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Chinamen can read, write and cipher with easy facility\xe2\x80\x94pity but all\r\nour petted _voters_ could. In California they rent little patches of\r\nground and do a deal of gardening. They will raise surprising crops of\r\nvegetables on a sand pile. They waste nothing. What is rubbish to a\r\nChristian, a Chinaman carefully preserves and makes useful in one way or\r\nanother. He gathers up all the old oyster and sardine cans that white\r\npeople throw away, and procures marketable tin and solder from them by\r\nmelting. He gathers up old bones and turns them into manure. In\r\nCalifornia he gets a living out of old mining claims that white men have\r\nabandoned as exhausted and worthless\xe2\x80\x94and then the officers come down on\r\nhim once a month with an exorbitant swindle to which the legislature has\r\ngiven the broad, general name of \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d mining tax, but it is usually\r\ninflicted on no foreigners but Chinamen. This swindle has in some cases\r\nbeen repeated once or twice on the same victim in the course of the same\r\nmonth\xe2\x80\x94but the public treasury was not additionally enriched by it,\r\nprobably.\r\n\r\nChinamen hold their dead in great reverence\xe2\x80\x94they worship their departed\r\nancestors, in fact. Hence, in China, a man\xe2\x80\x99s front yard, back yard, or\r\nany other part of his premises, is made his family burying ground, in\r\norder that he may visit the graves at any and all times. Therefore that\r\nhuge empire is one mighty cemetery; it is ridged and wringled from its\r\ncentre to its circumference with graves\xe2\x80\x94and inasmuch as every foot of\r\nground must be made to do its utmost, in China, lest the swarming\r\npopulation suffer for food, the very graves are cultivated and yield a\r\nharvest, custom holding this to be no dishonor to the dead. Since the\r\ndeparted are held in such worshipful reverence, a Chinaman cannot bear\r\nthat any indignity be offered the places where they sleep. Mr.\r\nBurlingame said that herein lay China\xe2\x80\x99s bitter opposition to railroads;\r\na road could not be built anywhere in the empire without disturbing the\r\ngraves of their ancestors or friends.\r\n\r\nA Chinaman hardly believes he could enjoy the hereafter except his body\r\nlay in his beloved China; also, he desires to receive, himself, after\r\ndeath, that worship with which he has honored his dead that preceded\r\nhim. Therefore, if he visits a foreign country, he makes arrangements to\r\nhave his bones returned to China in case he dies; if he hires to go to a\r\nforeign country on a labor contract, there is always a stipulation that\r\nhis body shall be taken back to China if he dies; if the government\r\nsells a gang of Coolies to a foreigner for the usual five-year term, it\r\nis specified in the contract that their bodies shall be restored to\r\nChina in case of death. On the Pacific coast the Chinamen all belong to\r\none or another of several great companies or organizations, and these\r\ncompanies keep track of their members, register their names, and ship\r\ntheir bodies home when they die. The See Yup Company is held to be the\r\nlargest of these. The Ning Yeong Company is next, and numbers eighteen\r\nthousand members on the coast. Its headquarters are at San Francisco,\r\nwhere it has a costly temple, several great officers (one of whom keeps\r\nregal state in seclusion and cannot be approached by common humanity),\r\nand a numerous priesthood. In it I was shown a register of its members,\r\nwith the dead and the date of their shipment to China duly marked. Every\r\nship that sails from San Francisco carries away a heavy freight of\r\nChinese corpses\xe2\x80\x94or did, at least, until the legislature, with an\r\ningenious refinement of Christian cruelty, forbade the shipments, as a\r\nneat underhanded way of deterring Chinese immigration. The bill was\r\noffered, whether it passed or not. It is my impression that it passed.\r\nThere was another bill\xe2\x80\x94it became a law\xe2\x80\x94compelling every incoming\r\nChinaman to be vaccinated on the wharf and pay a duly appointed quack\r\n(no decent doctor would defile himself with such legalized robbery) ten\r\ndollars for it. As few importers of Chinese would want to go to an\r\nexpense like that, the law-makers thought this would be another heavy\r\nblow to Chinese immigration.\r\n\r\nWhat the Chinese quarter of Virginia was like\xe2\x80\x94or, indeed, what the\r\nChinese quarter of any Pacific coast town was and is like\xe2\x80\x94may be\r\ngathered from this item which I printed in the Enterprise while\r\nreporting for that paper:\r\n\r\nCHINATOWN.\xe2\x80\x94Accompanied by a fellow reporter, we made a trip through our\r\nChinese quarter the other night. The Chinese have built their portion of\r\nthe city to suit themselves; and as they keep neither carriages nor\r\nwagons, their streets are not wide enough, as a general thing, to admit\r\nof the passage of vehicles. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night the Chinaman may be\r\nseen in all his glory. In every little cooped-up, dingy cavern of a hut,\r\nfaint with the odor of burning Josh-lights and with nothing to see the\r\ngloom by save the sickly, guttering tallow candle, were two or three\r\nyellow, long-tailed vagabonds, coiled up on a sort of short truckle-bed,\r\nsmoking opium, motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward\r\nfrom excess of satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94or rather the recent smoker looks thus,\r\nimmediately after having passed the pipe to his neighbor\xe2\x80\x94for opium-\r\nsmoking is a comfortless operation, and requires constant attention. A\r\nlamp sits on the bed, the length of the long pipe-stem from the smoker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth; he puts a pellet of opium on the end of a wire, sets it on fire,\r\nand plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would fill a hole with\r\nputty; then he applies the bowl to the lamp and proceeds to smoke\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of the juices in the\r\nstem would well-nigh turn the stomach of a statue. John likes it,\r\nthough; it soothes him, he takes about two dozen whiffs, and then rolls\r\nover to dream, Heaven only knows what, for we could not imagine by\r\nlooking at the soggy creature. Possibly in his visions he travels far\r\naway from the gross world and his regular washing, and feast on\r\nsucculent rats and birds\xe2\x80\x99-nests in Paradise.\r\n\r\nMr. Ah Sing keeps a general grocery and provision store at No. 13 Wang\r\nstreet. He lavished his hospitality upon our party in the friendliest\r\nway. He had various kinds of colored and colorless wines and brandies,\r\nwith unpronouncable names, imported from China in little crockery jugs,\r\nand which he offered to us in dainty little miniature wash-basins of\r\nporcelain. He offered us a mess of birds\xe2\x80\x99-nests; also, small, neat\r\nsausages, of which we could have swallowed several yards if we had\r\nchosen to try, but we suspected that each link contained the corpse of a\r\nmouse, and therefore refrained. Mr. Sing had in his store a thousand\r\narticles of merchandise, curious to behold, impossible to imagine the\r\nuses of, and beyond our ability to describe.\r\n\r\nHis ducks, however, and his eggs, we could understand; the former were\r\nsplit open and flattened out like codfish, and came from China in that\r\nshape, and the latter were plastered over with some kind of paste which\r\nkept them fresh and palatable through the long voyage.\r\n\r\nWe found Mr. Hong Wo, No. 37 Chow-chow street, making up a lottery\r\nscheme\xe2\x80\x94in fact we found a dozen others occupied in the same way in\r\nvarious parts of the quarter, for about every third Chinaman runs a\r\nlottery, and the balance of the tribe \xe2\x80\x9cbuck\xe2\x80\x9d at it. \xe2\x80\x9cTom,\xe2\x80\x9d who speaks\r\nfaultless English, and used to be chief and only cook to the\r\n_Territorial Enterprise_, when the establishment kept bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s hall\r\ntwo years ago, said that \xe2\x80\x9cSometime Chinaman buy ticket one dollar hap,\r\nketch um two tree hundred, sometime no ketch um anything; lottery like\r\none man fight um seventy\xe2\x80\x94may-be he whip, may-be he get whip heself,\r\nwelly good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n396.jpg (69K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the percentage being sixty-nine against him, the chances are,\r\nas a general thing, that \xe2\x80\x9che get whip heself.\xe2\x80\x9d We could not see that\r\nthese lotteries differed in any respect from our own, save that the\r\nfigures being Chinese, no ignorant white man might ever hope to succeed\r\nin telling \xe2\x80\x9ct\xe2\x80\x99other from which;\xe2\x80\x9d the manner of drawing is similar to\r\nours.\r\n\r\nMr. See Yup keeps a fancy store on Live Fox street. He sold us fans of\r\nwhite feathers, gorgeously ornamented; perfumery that smelled like\r\nLimburger cheese, Chinese pens, and watch-charms made of a stone\r\nunscratchable with steel instruments, yet polished and tinted like the\r\ninner coat of a sea-shell. As tokens of his esteem, See Yup presented\r\nthe party with gaudy plumes made of gold tinsel and trimmed with\r\npeacocks\xe2\x80\x99 feathers.\r\n\r\nWe ate chow-chow with chop-sticks in the celestial restaurants; our\r\ncomrade chided the moon-eyed damsels in front of the houses for their\r\nwant of feminine reserve; we received protecting Josh-lights from our\r\nhosts and \xe2\x80\x9cdickered\xe2\x80\x9d for a pagan God or two. Finally, we were impressed\r\nwith the genius of a Chinese book-keeper; he figured up his accounts on\r\na machine like a gridiron with buttons strung on its bars; the different\r\nrows represented units, tens, hundreds and thousands. He fingered them\r\nwith incredible rapidity\xe2\x80\x94in fact, he pushed them from place to place as\r\nfast as a musical professor\xe2\x80\x99s fingers travel over the keys of a piano.\r\n\r\nThey are a kindly disposed, well-meaning race, and are respected and\r\nwell treated by the upper classes, all over the Pacific coast. No\r\nCalifornian _gentleman or lady_ ever abuses or oppresses a Chinaman,\r\nunder any circumstances, an explanation that seems to be much needed in\r\nthe East. Only the scum of the population do it\xe2\x80\x94they and their children;\r\nthey, and, naturally and consistently, the policemen and politicians,\r\nlikewise, for these are the dust-licking pimps and slaves of the scum,\r\nthere as well as elsewhere in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n397.jpg (76K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI began to get tired of staying in one place so long.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer satisfying variety in going down to Carson to report\r\nthe proceedings of the legislature once a year, and horse-races and\r\npumpkin-shows once in three months; (they had got to raising pumpkins\r\nand potatoes in Washoe Valley, and of course one of the first\r\nachievements of the legislature was to institute a ten-thousand-dollar\r\nAgricultural Fair to show off forty dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of those pumpkins\r\nin\xe2\x80\x94however, the territorial legislature was usually spoken of as the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9casylum\xe2\x80\x9d). I wanted to see San Francisco. I wanted to go somewhere. I\r\nwanted\xe2\x80\x94I did not know _what_ I wanted. I had the \xe2\x80\x9cspring fever\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nwanted a change, principally, no doubt. Besides, a convention had framed\r\na State Constitution; nine men out of every ten wanted an office; I\r\nbelieved that these gentlemen would \xe2\x80\x9ctreat\xe2\x80\x9d the moneyless and the\r\nirresponsible among the population into adopting the constitution and\r\nthus well-nigh killing the country (it could not well carry such a load\r\nas a State government, since it had nothing to tax that could stand a\r\ntax, for undeveloped mines could not, and there were not fifty developed\r\nones in the land, there was but little realty to tax, and it did seem as\r\nif nobody was ever going to think of the simple salvation of inflicting\r\na money penalty on murder). I believed that a State government would\r\ndestroy the \xe2\x80\x9cflush times,\xe2\x80\x9d and I wanted to get away. I believed that the\r\nmining stocks I had on hand would soon be worth $100,000, and thought if\r\nthey reached that before the Constitution was adopted, I would sell out\r\nand make myself secure from the crash the change of government was going\r\nto bring. I considered $100,000 sufficient to go home with decently,\r\nthough it was but a small amount compared to what I had been expecting\r\nto return with. I felt rather down-hearted about it, but I tried to\r\ncomfort myself with the reflection that with such a sum I could not fall\r\ninto want. About this time a schoolmate of mine whom I had not seen\r\nsince boyhood, came tramping in on foot from Reese River, a very\r\nallegory of Poverty. The son of wealthy parents, here he was, in a\r\nstrange land, hungry, bootless, mantled in an ancient horse-blanket,\r\nroofed with a brimless hat, and so generally and so extravagantly\r\ndilapidated that he could have \xe2\x80\x9ctaken the shine out of the Prodigal Son\r\nhimself,\xe2\x80\x9d as he pleasantly remarked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n399.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe wanted to borrow forty-six dollars\xe2\x80\x94twenty-six to take him to San\r\nFrancisco, and twenty for something else; to buy some soap with, maybe,\r\nfor he needed it. I found I had but little more than the amount wanted,\r\nin my pocket; so I stepped in and borrowed forty-six dollars of a banker\r\n(on twenty days\xe2\x80\x99 time, without the formality of a note), and gave it\r\nhim, rather than walk half a block to the office, where I had some\r\nspecie laid up. If anybody had told me that it would take me two years\r\nto pay back that forty-six dollars to the banker (for I did not expect\r\nit of the Prodigal, and was not disappointed), I would have felt\r\ninjured. And so would the banker.\r\n\r\nI wanted a change. I wanted variety of some kind. It came. Mr. Goodman\r\nwent away for a week and left me the post of chief editor. It destroyed\r\nme. The first day, I wrote my \xe2\x80\x9cleader\xe2\x80\x9d in the forenoon. The second day,\r\nI had no subject and put it off till the afternoon. The third day I put\r\nit off till evening, and then copied an elaborate editorial out of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Cyclopedia,\xe2\x80\x9d that steadfast friend of the editor, all over\r\nthis land. The fourth day I \xe2\x80\x9cfooled around\xe2\x80\x9d till midnight, and then fell\r\nback on the Cyclopedia again. The fifth day I cudgeled my brain till\r\nmidnight, and then kept the press waiting while I penned some bitter\r\npersonalities on six different people. The sixth day I labored in\r\nanguish till far into the night and brought forth\xe2\x80\x94nothing. The paper\r\nwent to press without an editorial. The seventh day I resigned. On the\r\neighth, Mr. Goodman returned and found six duels on his hands\xe2\x80\x94my\r\npersonalities had borne fruit.\r\n\r\nNobody, except he has tried it, knows what it is to be an editor. It is\r\neasy to scribble local rubbish, with the facts all before you; it is\r\neasy to clip selections from other papers; it is easy to string out a\r\ncorrespondence from any locality; but it is unspeakable hardship to\r\nwrite editorials. _Subjects_ are the trouble\xe2\x80\x94the dreary lack of them, I\r\nmean. Every day, it is drag, drag, drag\xe2\x80\x94think, and worry and suffer\xe2\x80\x94all\r\nthe world is a dull blank, and yet the editorial columns _must_ be\r\nfilled. Only give the editor a _subject_, and his work is done\xe2\x80\x94it is no\r\ntrouble to write it up; but fancy how you would feel if you had to pump\r\nyour brains dry every day in the week, fifty-two weeks in the year. It\r\nmakes one low spirited simply to think of it. The matter that each\r\neditor of a daily paper in America writes in the course of a year would\r\nfill from four to eight bulky volumes like this book! Fancy what a\r\nlibrary an editor\xe2\x80\x99s work would make, after twenty or thirty years\xe2\x80\x99\r\nservice. Yet people often marvel that Dickens, Scott, Bulwer, Dumas,\r\netc., have been able to produce so many books. If these authors had\r\nwrought as voluminously as newspaper editors do, the result would be\r\nsomething to marvel at, indeed. How editors can continue this tremendous\r\nlabor, this exhausting consumption of brain fibre (for their work is\r\ncreative, and not a mere mechanical laying-up of facts, like reporting),\r\nday after day and year after year, is incomprehensible. Preachers take\r\ntwo months\xe2\x80\x99 holiday in midsummer, for they find that to produce two\r\nsermons a week is wearing, in the long run. In truth it must be so, and\r\nis so; and therefore, how an editor can take from ten to twenty texts\r\nand build upon them from ten to twenty painstaking editorials a week and\r\nkeep it up all the year round, is farther beyond comprehension than\r\never. Ever since I survived my week as editor, I have found at least one\r\npleasure in any newspaper that comes to my hand; it is in admiring the\r\nlong columns of editorial, and wondering to myself how in the mischief\r\nhe did it!\r\n\r\nMr. Goodman\xe2\x80\x99s return relieved me of employment, unless I chose to become\r\na reporter again. I could not do that; I could not serve in the ranks\r\nafter being General of the army. So I thought I would depart and go\r\nabroad into the world somewhere. Just at this juncture, Dan, my\r\nassociate in the reportorial department, told me, casually, that two\r\ncitizens had been trying to persuade him to go with them to New York and\r\naid in selling a rich silver mine which they had discovered and secured\r\nin a new mining district in our neighborhood. He said they offered to\r\npay his expenses and give him one third of the proceeds of the sale. He\r\nhad refused to go. It was the very opportunity I wanted. I abused him\r\nfor keeping so quiet about it, and not mentioning it sooner. He said it\r\nhad not occurred to him that I would like to go, and so he had\r\nrecommended them to apply to Marshall, the reporter of the other paper.\r\nI asked Dan if it was a good, honest mine, and no swindle. He said the\r\nmen had shown him nine tons of the rock, which they had got out to take\r\nto New York, and he could cheerfully say that he had seen but little\r\nrock in Nevada that was richer; and moreover, he said that they had\r\nsecured a tract of valuable timber and a mill-site, near the mine. My\r\nfirst idea was to kill Dan. But I changed my mind, notwithstanding I was\r\nso angry, for I thought maybe the chance was not yet lost. Dan said it\r\nwas by no means lost; that the men were absent at the mine again, and\r\nwould not be in Virginia to leave for the East for some ten days; that\r\nthey had requested him to do the talking to Marshall, and he had\r\npromised that he would either secure Marshall or somebody else for them\r\nby the time they got back; he would now say nothing to anybody till they\r\nreturned, and then fulfil his promise by furnishing me to them.\r\n\r\nIt was splendid. I went to bed all on fire with excitement; for nobody\r\nhad yet gone East to sell a Nevada silver mine, and the field was white\r\nfor the sickle. I felt that such a mine as the one described by Dan\r\nwould bring a princely sum in New York, and sell without delay or\r\ndifficulty. I could not sleep, my fancy so rioted through its castles in\r\nthe air. It was the \xe2\x80\x9cblind lead\xe2\x80\x9d come again.\r\n\r\nNext day I got away, on the coach, with the usual eclat attending\r\ndepartures of old citizens,\xe2\x80\x94for if you have only half a dozen friends\r\nout there they will make noise for a hundred rather than let you seem to\r\ngo away neglected and unregretted\xe2\x80\x94and Dan promised to keep strict watch\r\nfor the men that had the mine to sell.\r\n\r\nThe trip was signalized but by one little incident, and that occurred\r\njust as we were about to start. A very seedy looking vagabond passenger\r\ngot out of the stage a moment to wait till the usual ballast of silver\r\nbricks was thrown in. He was standing on the pavement, when an awkward\r\nexpress employee, carrying a brick weighing a hundred pounds, stumbled\r\nand let it fall on the bummer\xe2\x80\x99s foot. He instantly dropped on the ground\r\nand began to howl in the most heart-breaking way. A sympathizing crowd\r\ngathered around and were going to pull his boot off; but he screamed\r\nlouder than ever and they desisted; then he fell to gasping, and between\r\nthe gasps ejaculated \xe2\x80\x9cBrandy! for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, brandy!\xe2\x80\x9d They poured\r\nhalf a pint down him, and it wonderfully restored and comforted him.\r\nThen he begged the people to assist him to the stage, which was done.\r\nThe express people urged him to have a doctor at their expense, but he\r\ndeclined, and said that if he only had a little brandy to take along\r\nwith him, to soothe his paroxyms of pain when they came on, he would be\r\ngrateful and content. He was quickly supplied with two bottles, and we\r\ndrove off. He was so smiling and happy after that, that I could not\r\nrefrain from asking him how he could possibly be so comfortable with a\r\ncrushed foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n403.jpg (72K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a drink for twelve hours, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ncent to my name. I was most perishing\xe2\x80\x94and so, when that duffer dropped\r\nthat hundred-pounder on my foot, I see my chance. Got a cork leg, you\r\nknow!\xe2\x80\x9d and he pulled up his pantaloons and proved it.\r\n\r\nHe was as drunk as a lord all day long, and full of chucklings over his\r\ntimely ingenuity.\r\n\r\nOne drunken man necessarily reminds one of another. I once heard a\r\ngentleman tell about an incident which he witnessed in a Californian\r\nbar- room. He entitled it \xe2\x80\x9cYe Modest Man Taketh a Drink.\xe2\x80\x9d It was nothing\r\nbut a bit of acting, but it seemed to me a perfect rendering, and worthy\r\nof Toodles himself. The modest man, tolerably far gone with beer and\r\nother matters, enters a saloon (twenty-five cents is the price for\r\nanything and everything, and specie the only money used) and lays down a\r\nhalf dollar; calls for whiskey and drinks it; the bar-keeper makes\r\nchange and lays the quarter in a wet place on the counter; the modest\r\nman fumbles at it with nerveless fingers, but it slips and the water\r\nholds it; he contemplates it, and tries again; same result; observes\r\nthat people are interested in what he is at, blushes; fumbles at the\r\nquarter again\xe2\x80\x94blushes\xe2\x80\x94puts his forefinger carefully, slowly down, to\r\nmake sure of his aim\xe2\x80\x94pushes the coin toward the bar-keeper, and says\r\nwith a sigh:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n404.jpg (120K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(\xe2\x80\x99_ic_)Gimme a cigar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNaturally, another gentleman present told about another drunken man. He\r\nsaid he reeled toward home late at night; made a mistake and entered the\r\nwrong gate; thought he saw a dog on the stoop; and it was\xe2\x80\x94an iron one.\r\n\r\nHe stopped and considered; wondered if it was a dangerous dog; ventured\r\nto say \xe2\x80\x9cBe (hic) begone!\xe2\x80\x9d No effect. Then he approached warily, and\r\nadopted conciliation; pursed up his lips and tried to whistle, but\r\nfailed; still approached, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor dog!\xe2\x80\x94doggy, doggy, doggy!\xe2\x80\x94poor\r\ndoggy-dog!\xe2\x80\x9d Got up on the stoop, still petting with fond names; till\r\nmaster of the advantages; then exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave, you thief!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94planted a\r\nvindictive kick in his ribs, and went head-over-heels overboard, of\r\ncourse. A pause; a sigh or two of pain, and then a remark in a\r\nreflective voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwful solid dog. What could he ben eating? (\xe2\x80\x99ic!) Rocks, p\xe2\x80\x99raps. Such\r\nanimals is dangerous.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 At\xe2\x80\x99s what I say\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re dangerous. If a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x94(\xe2\x80\x99ic!)\xe2\x80\x94if a man wants to feed a dog on rocks, let him _feed_ him on\r\nrocks; \xe2\x80\x99at\xe2\x80\x99s all right; but let him keep him at _home_\xe2\x80\x94not have him\r\nlayin\xe2\x80\x99 round promiscuous, where (\xe2\x80\x99ic!) where people\xe2\x80\x99s liable to stumble\r\nover him when they ain\xe2\x80\x99t noticin\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not without regret that I took a last look at the tiny flag (it\r\nwas thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide) fluttering like a lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhandkerchief from the topmost peak of Mount Davidson, two thousand feet\r\nabove Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s roofs, and felt that doubtless I was bidding a\r\npermanent farewell to a city which had afforded me the most vigorous\r\nenjoyment of life I had ever experienced. And this reminds me of an\r\nincident which the dullest memory Virginia could boast at the time it\r\nhappened must vividly recall, at times, till its possessor dies. Late\r\none summer afternoon we had a rain shower.\r\n\r\nThat was astonishing enough, in itself, to set the whole town buzzing,\r\nfor it only rains (during a week or two weeks) in the winter in Nevada,\r\nand even then not enough at a time to make it worth while for any\r\nmerchant to keep umbrellas for sale. But the rain was not the chief\r\nwonder. It only lasted five or ten minutes; while the people were still\r\ntalking about it all the heavens gathered to themselves a dense\r\nblackness as of midnight. All the vast eastern front of Mount Davidson,\r\nover-looking the city, put on such a funereal gloom that only the\r\nnearness and solidity of the mountain made its outlines even faintly\r\ndistinguishable from the dead blackness of the heavens they rested\r\nagainst. This unaccustomed sight turned all eyes toward the mountain;\r\nand as they looked, a little tongue of rich golden flame was seen waving\r\nand quivering in the heart of the midnight, away up on the extreme\r\nsummit! In a few minutes the streets were packed with people, gazing\r\nwith hardly an uttered word, at the one brilliant mote in the brooding\r\nworld of darkness. It flicked like a candle-flame, and looked no larger;\r\nbut with such a background it was wonderfully bright, small as it was.\r\nIt was the flag!\xe2\x80\x94though no one suspected it at first, it seemed so like\r\na supernatural visitor of some kind\xe2\x80\x94a mysterious messenger of good\r\ntidings, some were fain to believe. It was the nation\xe2\x80\x99s emblem\r\ntransfigured by the departing rays of a sun that was entirely palled\r\nfrom view; and on no other object did the glory fall, in all the broad\r\npanorama of mountain ranges and deserts. Not even upon the staff of the\r\nflag\xe2\x80\x94for that, a needle in the distance at any time, was now untouched\r\nby the light and undistinguishable in the gloom. For a whole hour the\r\nweird visitor winked and burned in its lofty solitude, and still the\r\nthousands of uplifted eyes watched it with fascinated interest. How the\r\npeople were wrought up! The superstition grew apace that this was a\r\nmystic courier come with great news from the war\xe2\x80\x94the poetry of the idea\r\nexcusing and commending it\xe2\x80\x94and on it spread, from heart to heart, from\r\nlip to lip and from street to street, till there was a general impulse\r\nto have out the military and welcome the bright waif with a salvo of\r\nartillery!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n406.jpg (72K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd all that time one sorely tried man, the telegraph operator sworn to\r\nofficial secrecy, had to lock his lips and chain his tongue with a\r\nsilence that was like to rend them; for he, and he only, of all the\r\nspeculating multitude, knew the great things this sinking sun had seen\r\nthat day in the east\xe2\x80\x94Vicksburg fallen, and the Union arms victorious at\r\nGettysburg!\r\n\r\nBut for the journalistic monopoly that forbade the slightest revealment\r\nof eastern news till a day after its publication in the California\r\npapers, the glorified flag on Mount Davidson would have been saluted and\r\nre-saluted, that memorable evening, as long as there was a charge of\r\npowder to thunder with; the city would have been illuminated, and every\r\nman that had any respect for himself would have got drunk,\xe2\x80\x94as was the\r\ncustom of the country on all occasions of public moment. Even at this\r\ndistant day I cannot think of this needlessly marred supreme opportunity\r\nwithout regret. What a time we might have had!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n407.jpg (12K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rumbled over the plains and valleys, climbed the Sierras to the\r\nclouds, and looked down upon summer-clad California. And I will remark\r\nhere, in passing, that all scenery in California requires _distance_ to\r\ngive it its highest charm. The mountains are imposing in their sublimity\r\nand their majesty of form and altitude, from any point of view\xe2\x80\x94but one\r\nmust have distance to soften their ruggedness and enrich their tintings;\r\na Californian forest is best at a little distance, for there is a sad\r\npoverty of variety in species, the trees being chiefly of one monotonous\r\nfamily\xe2\x80\x94redwood, pine, spruce, fir\xe2\x80\x94and so, at a near view there is a\r\nwearisome sameness of attitude in their rigid arms, stretched downward\r\nand outward in one continued and reiterated appeal to all men to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSh!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t say a word!\xe2\x80\x94you might disturb somebody!\xe2\x80\x9d Close at hand, too,\r\nthere is a reliefless and relentless smell of pitch and turpentine;\r\nthere is a ceaseless melancholy in their sighing and complaining\r\nfoliage; one walks over a soundless carpet of beaten yellow bark and\r\ndead spines of the foliage till he feels like a wandering spirit bereft\r\nof a footfall; he tires of the endless tufts of needles and yearns for\r\nsubstantial, shapely leaves; he looks for moss and grass to loll upon,\r\nand finds none, for where there is no bark there is naked clay and dirt,\r\nenemies to pensive musing and clean apparel. Often a grassy plain in\r\nCalifornia, is what it should be, but often, too, it is best\r\ncontemplated at a distance, because although its grass blades are tall,\r\nthey stand up vindictively straight and self-sufficient, and are\r\nunsociably wide apart, with uncomely spots of barren sand between.\r\n\r\nOne of the queerest things I know of, is to hear tourists from \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nStates\xe2\x80\x9d go into ecstasies over the loveliness of \xe2\x80\x9cever-blooming\r\nCalifornia.\xe2\x80\x9d And they always do go into that sort of ecstasies. But\r\nperhaps they would modify them if they knew how old Californians, with\r\nthe memory full upon them of the dust-covered and questionable summer\r\ngreens of Californian \xe2\x80\x9cverdure,\xe2\x80\x9d stand astonished, and filled with\r\nworshipping admiration, in the presence of the lavish richness, the\r\nbrilliant green, the infinite freshness, the spend-thrift variety of\r\nform and species and foliage that make an Eastern landscape a vision of\r\nParadise itself. The idea of a man falling into raptures over grave and\r\nsombre California, when that man has seen New England\xe2\x80\x99s meadow-expanses\r\nand her maples, oaks and cathedral-windowed elms decked in summer\r\nattire, or the opaline splendors of autumn descending upon her forests,\r\ncomes very near being funny\xe2\x80\x94would be, in fact, but that it is so\r\npathetic. No land with an unvarying climate can be very beautiful. The\r\ntropics are not, for all the sentiment that is wasted on them. They seem\r\nbeautiful at first, but sameness impairs the charm by and by. _Change_\r\nis the handmaiden Nature requires to do her miracles with. The land that\r\nhas four well-defined seasons, cannot lack beauty, or pall with\r\nmonotony. Each season brings a world of enjoyment and interest in the\r\nwatching of its unfolding, its gradual, harmonious development, its\r\nculminating graces\xe2\x80\x94and just as one begins to tire of it, it passes away\r\nand a radical change comes, with new witcheries and new glories in its\r\ntrain. And I think that to one in sympathy with nature, each season, in\r\nits turn, seems the loveliest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n409.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, a truly fascinating city to live in, is stately and\r\nhandsome at a fair distance, but close at hand one notes that the\r\narchitecture is mostly old-fashioned, many streets are made up of\r\ndecaying, smoke-grimed, wooden houses, and the barren sand-hills toward\r\nthe outskirts obtrude themselves too prominently. Even the kindly\r\nclimate is sometimes pleasanter when read about than personally\r\nexperienced, for a lovely, cloudless sky wears out its welcome by and\r\nby, and then when the longed for rain does come it _stays_. Even the\r\nplayful earthquake is better contemplated at a dis\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHowever there are varying opinions about that.\r\n\r\nThe climate of San Francisco is mild and singularly equable. The\r\nthermometer stands at about seventy degrees the year round. It hardly\r\nchanges at all. You sleep under one or two light blankets Summer and\r\nWinter, and never use a mosquito bar. Nobody ever wears Summer clothing.\r\nYou wear black broadcloth\xe2\x80\x94if you have it\xe2\x80\x94in August and January, just the\r\nsame. It is no colder, and no warmer, in the one month than the other.\r\nYou do not use overcoats and you do not use fans. It is as pleasant a\r\nclimate as could well be contrived, take it all around, and is doubtless\r\nthe most unvarying in the whole world. The wind blows there a good deal\r\nin the summer months, but then you can go over to Oakland, if you\r\nchoose\xe2\x80\x94three or four miles away\xe2\x80\x94it does not blow there. It has only\r\nsnowed twice in San Francisco in nineteen years, and then it only\r\nremained on the ground long enough to astonish the children, and set\r\nthem to wondering what the feathery stuff was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n410.jpg (53K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring eight months of the year, straight along, the skies are bright\r\nand cloudless, and never a drop of rain falls. But when the other four\r\nmonths come along, you will need to go and steal an umbrella. Because\r\nyou will require it. Not just one day, but one hundred and twenty days\r\nin hardly varying succession. When you want to go visiting, or attend\r\nchurch, or the theatre, you never look up at the clouds to see whether\r\nit is likely to rain or not\xe2\x80\x94you look at the almanac. If it is Winter, it\r\n_will_ rain\xe2\x80\x94and if it is Summer, it _won\xe2\x80\x99t_ rain, and you cannot help\r\nit. You never need a lightning-rod, because it never thunders and it\r\nnever lightens. And after you have listened for six or eight weeks,\r\nevery night, to the dismal monotony of those quiet rains, you will wish\r\nin your heart the thunder _would_ leap and crash and roar along those\r\ndrowsy skies once, and make everything alive\xe2\x80\x94you will wish the prisoned\r\nlightnings _would_ cleave the dull firmament asunder and light it with a\r\nblinding glare for _one_ little instant. You would give _anything_ to\r\nhear the old familiar thunder again and see the lightning strike\r\nsomebody. And along in the Summer, when you have suffered about four\r\nmonths of lustrous, pitiless sunshine, you are ready to go down on your\r\nknees and plead for rain\xe2\x80\x94hail\xe2\x80\x94snow\xe2\x80\x94thunder and lightning\xe2\x80\x94anything to\r\nbreak the monotony\xe2\x80\x94you will take an earthquake, if you cannot do any\r\nbetter. And the chances are that you\xe2\x80\x99ll get it, too.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is built on sand hills, but they are prolific sand hills.\r\nThey yield a generous vegetation. All the rare flowers which people in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe States\xe2\x80\x9d rear with such patient care in parlor flower-pots and\r\ngreen-houses, flourish luxuriantly in the open air there all the year\r\nround. Calla lilies, all sorts of geraniums, passion flowers, moss\r\nroses\xe2\x80\x94I do not know the names of a tenth part of them. I only know that\r\nwhile New Yorkers are burdened with banks and drifts of snow,\r\nCalifornians are burdened with banks and drifts of flowers, if they only\r\nkeep their hands off and let them grow. And I have heard that they have\r\nalso that rarest and most curious of all the flowers, the beautiful\r\nEspiritu Santo, as the Spaniards call it\xe2\x80\x94or flower of the Holy\r\nSpirit\xe2\x80\x94though I thought it grew only in Central America\xe2\x80\x94down on the\r\nIsthmus. In its cup is the daintiest little facsimile of a dove, as pure\r\nas snow. The Spaniards have a superstitious reverence for it. The\r\nblossom has been conveyed to the States, submerged in ether; and the\r\nbulb has been taken thither also, but every attempt to make it bloom\r\nafter it arrived, has failed.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere spoken of the endless Winter of Mono, California, and\r\nbut this moment of the eternal Spring of San Francisco. Now if we travel\r\na hundred miles in a straight line, we come to the eternal Summer of\r\nSacramento. One never sees Summer-clothing or mosquitoes in San\r\nFrancisco\xe2\x80\x94but they can be found in Sacramento. Not always and\r\nunvaryingly, but about one hundred and forty-three months out of twelve\r\nyears, perhaps. Flowers bloom there, always, the reader can easily\r\nbelieve\xe2\x80\x94people suffer and sweat, and swear, morning, noon and night, and\r\nwear out their stanchest energies fanning themselves. It gets hot there,\r\nbut if you go down to Fort Yuma you will find it hotter. Fort Yuma is\r\nprobably the hottest place on earth. The thermometer stays at one\r\nhundred and twenty in the shade there all the time\xe2\x80\x94except when it varies\r\nand goes higher. It is a U.S. military post, and its occupants get so\r\nused to the terrific heat that they suffer without it. There is a\r\ntradition (attributed to John Phenix [It has been purloined by fifty\r\ndifferent scribblers who were too poor to invent a fancy but not ashamed\r\nto steal one.\xe2\x80\x94M. T.]) that a very, very wicked soldier died there, once,\r\nand of course, went straight to the hottest corner of perdition,\xe2\x80\x94and the\r\nnext day he _telegraphed back for his blankets._ There is no doubt about\r\nthe truth of this statement\xe2\x80\x94there can be no doubt about it. I have seen\r\nthe place where that soldier used to board. In Sacramento it is fiery\r\nSummer always, and you can gather roses, and eat strawberries and ice-\r\ncream, and wear white linen clothes, and pant and perspire, at eight or\r\nnine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and then take the cars, and at noon put on\r\nyour furs and your skates, and go skimming over frozen Donner Lake,\r\nseven thousand feet above the valley, among snow banks fifteen feet\r\ndeep, and in the shadow of grand mountain peaks that lift their frosty\r\ncrags ten thousand feet above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n413.jpg (94K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a transition for you! Where will you find another like it in\r\nthe Western hemisphere? And some of us have swept around snow-walled\r\ncurves of the Pacific Railroad in that vicinity, six thousand feet above\r\nthe sea, and looked down as the birds do, upon the deathless Summer of\r\nthe Sacramento Valley, with its fruitful fields, its feathery foliage,\r\nits silver streams, all slumbering in the mellow haze of its enchanted\r\natmosphere, and all infinitely softened and spiritualized by distance\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndreamy, exquisite glimpse of fairyland, made all the more charming and\r\nstriking that it was caught through a forbidden gateway of ice and snow,\r\nand savage crags and precipices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this Sacramento Valley, just referred to, that a deal of the\r\nmost lucrative of the early gold mining was done, and you may still see,\r\nin places, its grassy slopes and levels torn and guttered and disfigured\r\nby the avaricious spoilers of fifteen and twenty years ago. You may see\r\nsuch disfigurements far and wide over California\xe2\x80\x94and in some such\r\nplaces, where only meadows and forests are visible\xe2\x80\x94not a living\r\ncreature, not a house, no stick or stone or remnant of a ruin, and not a\r\nsound, not even a whisper to disturb the Sabbath stillness\xe2\x80\x94you will find\r\nit hard to believe that there stood at one time a fiercely-flourishing\r\nlittle city, of two thousand or three thousand souls, with its\r\nnewspaper, fire company, brass band, volunteer militia, bank, hotels,\r\nnoisy Fourth of July processions and speeches, gambling hells crammed\r\nwith tobacco smoke, profanity, and rough-bearded men of all nations and\r\ncolors, with tables heaped with gold dust sufficient for the revenues of\r\na German principality\xe2\x80\x94streets crowded and rife with business\xe2\x80\x94town lots\r\nworth four hundred dollars a front foot\xe2\x80\x94labor, laughter, music, dancing,\r\nswearing, fighting, shooting, stabbing\xe2\x80\x94a bloody inquest and a man for\r\nbreakfast every morning\xe2\x80\x94_everything_ that delights and adorns\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94all the appointments and appurtenances of a thriving and\r\nprosperous and promising young city,\xe2\x80\x94and _now_ nothing is left of it all\r\nbut a lifeless, homeless solitude. The men are gone, the houses have\r\nvanished, even the _name_ of the place is forgotten. In no other land,\r\nin modern times, have towns so absolutely died and disappeared, as in\r\nthe old mining regions of California.\r\n\r\nIt was a driving, vigorous, restless population in those days. It was a\r\n_curious_ population. It was the _only_ population of the kind that the\r\nworld has ever seen gathered together, and it is not likely that the\r\nworld will ever see its like again. For observe, it was an assemblage of\r\ntwo hundred thousand _young_ men\xe2\x80\x94not simpering, dainty, kid-gloved\r\nweaklings, but stalwart, muscular, dauntless young braves, brimful of\r\npush and energy, and royally endowed with every attribute that goes to\r\nmake up a peerless and magnificent manhood\xe2\x80\x94the very pick and choice of\r\nthe world\xe2\x80\x99s glorious ones. No women, no children, no gray and stooping\r\nveterans,\xe2\x80\x94none but erect, bright-eyed, quick-moving, strong-handed young\r\ngiants\xe2\x80\x94the strangest population, the finest population, the most gallant\r\nhost that ever trooped down the startled solitudes of an unpeopled land.\r\nAnd where are they now? Scattered to the ends of the earth\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nprematurely aged and decrepit\xe2\x80\x94or shot or stabbed in street affrays\xe2\x80\x94or\r\ndead of disappointed hopes and broken hearts\xe2\x80\x94all gone, or nearly\r\nall\xe2\x80\x94victims devoted upon the altar of the golden calf\xe2\x80\x94the noblest\r\nholocaust that ever wafted its sacrificial incense heavenward. It is\r\npitiful to think upon.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid population\xe2\x80\x94for all the slow, sleepy, sluggish-brained\r\nsloths staid at home\xe2\x80\x94you never find that sort of people among\r\npioneers\xe2\x80\x94you cannot build pioneers out of that sort of material. It was\r\nthat population that gave to California a name for getting up astounding\r\nenterprises and rushing them through with a magnificent dash and daring\r\nand a recklessness of cost or consequences, which she bears unto this\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94and when she projects a new surprise, the grave world smiles as\r\nusual, and says \xe2\x80\x9cWell, that is California all over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut they were rough in those times! They fairly reveled in gold, whisky,\r\nfights, and fandangoes, and were unspeakably happy. The honest miner\r\nraked from a hundred to a thousand dollars out of his claim a day, and\r\nwhat with the gambling dens and the other entertainments, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ncent the next morning, if he had any sort of luck. They cooked their own\r\nbacon and beans, sewed on their own buttons, washed their own\r\nshirts\xe2\x80\x94blue woollen ones; and if a man wanted a fight on his hands\r\nwithout any annoying delay, all he had to do was to appear in public in\r\na white shirt or a stove-pipe hat, and he would be accommodated. For\r\nthose people hated aristocrats. They had a particular and malignant\r\nanimosity toward what they called a \xe2\x80\x9cbiled shirt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a wild, free, disorderly, grotesque society! _Men_\xe2\x80\x94only swarming\r\nhosts of stalwart _men_\xe2\x80\x94nothing juvenile, nothing feminine, visible\r\nanywhere!\r\n\r\nIn those days miners would flock in crowds to catch a glimpse of that\r\nrare and blessed spectacle, a woman! Old inhabitants tell how, in a\r\ncertain camp, the news went abroad early in the morning that a woman was\r\ncome! They had seen a calico dress hanging out of a wagon down at the\r\ncamping-ground\xe2\x80\x94sign of emigrants from over the great plains. Everybody\r\nwent down there, and a shout went up when an actual, bona fide dress was\r\ndiscovered fluttering in the wind! The male emigrant was visible. The\r\nminers said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch her out!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my wife, gentlemen\xe2\x80\x94she is sick\xe2\x80\x94we have been robbed of\r\nmoney, provisions, everything, by the Indians\xe2\x80\x94we want to rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFetch her out! We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, gentlemen, the poor thing, she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFETCH HER OUT!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n416.jpg (87K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe \xe2\x80\x9cfetched her out,\xe2\x80\x9d and they swung their hats and sent up three\r\nrousing cheers and a tiger; and they crowded around and gazed at her,\r\nand touched her dress, and listened to her voice with the look of men\r\nwho listened to a _memory_ rather than a present reality\xe2\x80\x94and then they\r\ncollected twenty-five hundred dollars in gold and gave it to the man,\r\nand swung their hats again and gave three more cheers, and went home\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nOnce I dined in San Francisco with the family of a pioneer, and talked\r\nwith his daughter, a young lady whose first experience in San Francisco\r\nwas an adventure, though she herself did not remember it, as she was\r\nonly two or three years old at the time. Her father said that, after\r\nlanding from the ship, they were walking up the street, a servant\r\nleading the party with the little girl in her arms. And presently a huge\r\nminer, bearded, belted, spurred, and bristling with deadly weapons\xe2\x80\x94just\r\ndown from a long campaign in the mountains, evidently&mdashbarred the\r\nway, stopped the servant, and stood gazing, with a face all alive with\r\ngratification and astonishment. Then he said, reverently:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n417.jpg (58K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t a child!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he snatched a little leather sack\r\nout of his pocket and said to the servant:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a hundred and fifty dollars in dust, there, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to\r\nyou to let me kiss the child!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat anecdote is _true_.\r\n\r\nBut see how things change. Sitting at that dinner-table, listening to\r\nthat anecdote, if I had offered double the money for the privilege of\r\nkissing the same child, I would have been refused. Seventeen added years\r\nhave far more than doubled the price.\r\n\r\nAnd while upon this subject I will remark that once in Star City, in the\r\nHumboldt Mountains, I took my place in a sort of long, post-office\r\nsingle file of miners, to patiently await my chance to peep through a\r\ncrack in the cabin and get a sight of the splendid new sensation\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ngenuine, live Woman! And at the end of half of an hour my turn came, and\r\nI put my eye to the crack, and there she was, with one arm akimbo, and\r\ntossing flap-jacks in a frying-pan with the other.\r\n\r\nAnd she was one hundred and sixty-five [Being in calmer mood, now, I\r\nvoluntarily knock off a hundred from that.\xe2\x80\x94M.T.] years old, and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ntooth in her head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n418.jpg (28K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few months I enjoyed what to me was an entirely new phase of\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94a butterfly idleness; nothing to do, nobody to be responsible\r\nto, and untroubled with financial uneasiness. I fell in love with the\r\nmost cordial and sociable city in the Union. After the sage-brush and\r\nalkali deserts of Washoe, San Francisco was Paradise to me. I lived at\r\nthe best hotel, exhibited my clothes in the most conspicuous places,\r\ninfested the opera, and learned to seem enraptured with music which\r\noftener afflicted my ignorant ear than enchanted it, if I had had the\r\nvulgar honesty to confess it. However, I suppose I was not greatly worse\r\nthan the most of my countrymen in that. I had longed to be a butterfly,\r\nand I was one at last. I attended private parties in sumptuous evening\r\ndress, simpered and aired my graces like a born beau, and polked and\r\nschottisched with a step peculiar to myself\xe2\x80\x94and the kangaroo. In a word,\r\nI kept the due state of a man worth a hundred thousand dollars\r\n(prospectively,) and likely to reach absolute affluence when that\r\nsilver- mine sale should be ultimately achieved in the East. I spent\r\nmoney with a free hand, and meantime watched the stock sales with an\r\ninterested eye and looked to see what might happen in Nevada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420.jpg (49K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething very important happened. The property holders of Nevada voted\r\nagainst the State Constitution; but the folks who had nothing to lose\r\nwere in the majority, and carried the measure over their heads. But\r\nafter all it did not immediately look like a disaster, though\r\nunquestionably it was one I hesitated, calculated the chances, and then\r\nconcluded not to sell. Stocks went on rising; speculation went mad;\r\nbankers, merchants, lawyers, doctors, mechanics, laborers, even the very\r\nwasherwomen and servant girls, were putting up their earnings on silver\r\nstocks, and every sun that rose in the morning went down on paupers\r\nenriched and rich men beggared. What a gambling carnival it was! Gould\r\nand Curry soared to six thousand three hundred dollars a foot! And\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94all of a sudden, out went the bottom and everything and everybody\r\nwent to ruin and destruction! The wreck was complete.\r\n\r\nThe bubble scarcely left a microscopic moisture behind it. I was an\r\nearly beggar and a thorough one. My hoarded stocks were not worth the\r\npaper they were printed on. I threw them all away. I, the cheerful idiot\r\nthat had been squandering money like water, and thought myself beyond\r\nthe reach of misfortune, had not now as much as fifty dollars when I\r\ngathered together my various debts and paid them. I removed from the\r\nhotel to a very private boarding house. I took a reporter\xe2\x80\x99s berth and\r\nwent to work. I was not entirely broken in spirit, for I was building\r\nconfidently on the sale of the silver mine in the east. But I could not\r\nhear from Dan. My letters miscarried or were not answered.\r\n\r\nOne day I did not feel vigorous and remained away from the office. The\r\nnext day I went down toward noon as usual, and found a note on my desk\r\nwhich had been there twenty-four hours. It was signed \xe2\x80\x9cMarshall\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nVirginia reporter\xe2\x80\x94and contained a request that I should call at the\r\nhotel and see him and a friend or two that night, as they would sail for\r\nthe east in the morning. A postscript added that their errand was a big\r\nmining speculation! I was hardly ever so sick in my life. I abused\r\nmyself for leaving Virginia and entrusting to another man a matter I\r\nought to have attended to myself; I abused myself for remaining away\r\nfrom the office on the one day of all the year that I should have been\r\nthere. And thus berating myself I trotted a mile to the steamer wharf\r\nand arrived just in time to be too late. The ship was in the stream and\r\nunder way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n421.jpg (20K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI comforted myself with the thought that may be the speculation would\r\namount to nothing\xe2\x80\x94poor comfort at best\xe2\x80\x94and then went back to my slavery,\r\nresolved to put up with my thirty-five dollars a week and forget all\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nA month afterward I enjoyed my first earthquake. It was one which was\r\nlong called the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d earthquake, and is doubtless so distinguished\r\ntill this day. It was just after noon, on a bright October day. I was\r\ncoming down Third street. The only objects in motion anywhere in sight\r\nin that thickly built and populous quarter, were a man in a buggy behind\r\nme, and a street car wending slowly up the cross street. Otherwise, all\r\nwas solitude and a Sabbath stillness. As I turned the corner, around a\r\nframe house, there was a great rattle and jar, and it occurred to me\r\nthat here was an item!\xe2\x80\x94no doubt a fight in that house. Before I could\r\nturn and seek the door, there came a really terrific shock; the ground\r\nseemed to roll under me in waves, interrupted by a violent joggling up\r\nand down, and there was a heavy grinding noise as of brick houses\r\nrubbing together. I fell up against the frame house and hurt my elbow. I\r\nknew what it was, now, and from mere reportorial instinct, nothing else,\r\ntook out my watch and noted the time of day; at that moment a third and\r\nstill severer shock came, and as I reeled about on the pavement trying\r\nto keep my footing, I saw a sight! The entire front of a tall four-story\r\nbrick building in Third street sprung outward like a door and fell\r\nsprawling across the street, raising a dust like a great volume of\r\nsmoke! And here came the buggy\xe2\x80\x94overboard went the man, and in less time\r\nthan I can tell it the vehicle was distributed in small fragments along\r\nthree hundred yards of street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n422.jpg (87K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne could have fancied that somebody had fired a charge of chair-rounds\r\nand rags down the thoroughfare. The street car had stopped, the horses\r\nwere rearing and plunging, the passengers were pouring out at both ends,\r\nand one fat man had crashed half way through a glass window on one side\r\nof the car, got wedged fast and was squirming and screaming like an\r\nimpaled madman. Every door, of every house, as far as the eye could\r\nreach, was vomiting a stream of human beings; and almost before one\r\ncould execute a wink and begin another, there was a massed multitude of\r\npeople stretching in endless procession down every street my position\r\ncommanded. Never was solemn solitude turned into teeming life quicker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n423a.jpg (38K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the wonders wrought by \xe2\x80\x9cthe great earthquake,\xe2\x80\x9d these were all that\r\ncame under my eye; but the tricks it did, elsewhere, and far and wide\r\nover the town, made toothsome gossip for nine days.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of property was trifling\xe2\x80\x94the injury to it was wide-\r\nspread and somewhat serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n423b.jpg (37K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ccuriosities\xe2\x80\x9d of the earthquake were simply endless. Gentlemen and\r\nladies who were sick, or were taking a siesta, or had dissipated till a\r\nlate hour and were making up lost sleep, thronged into the public\r\nstreets in all sorts of queer apparel, and some without any at all. One\r\nwoman who had been washing a naked child, ran down the street holding it\r\nby the ankles as if it were a dressed turkey. Prominent citizens who\r\nwere supposed to keep the Sabbath strictly, rushed out of saloons in\r\ntheir shirt-sleeves, with billiard cues in their hands. Dozens of men\r\nwith necks swathed in napkins, rushed from barber-shops, lathered to the\r\neyes or with one cheek clean shaved and the other still bearing a hairy\r\nstubble. Horses broke from stables, and a frightened dog rushed up a\r\nshort attic ladder and out on to a roof, and when his scare was over had\r\nnot the nerve to go down again the same way he had gone up.\r\n\r\nA prominent editor flew down stairs, in the principal hotel, with\r\nnothing on but one brief undergarment\xe2\x80\x94met a chambermaid, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what _shall_ I do! Where shall I go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe responded with naive serenity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have no choice, you might try a clothing-store!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n424.jpg (63K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain foreign consul\xe2\x80\x99s lady was the acknowledged leader of fashion,\r\nand every time she appeared in anything new or extraordinary, the ladies\r\nin the vicinity made a raid on their husbands\xe2\x80\x99 purses and arrayed\r\nthemselves similarly. One man who had suffered considerably and growled\r\naccordingly, was standing at the window when the shocks came, and the\r\nnext instant the consul\xe2\x80\x99s wife, just out of the bath, fled by with no\r\nother apology for clothing than\xe2\x80\x94a bath-towel! The sufferer rose superior\r\nto the terrors of the earthquake, and said to his wife:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow that is something _like_! Get out your towel my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n425 (40K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plastering that fell from ceilings in San Francisco that day, would\r\nhave covered several acres of ground. For some days afterward, groups of\r\neyeing and pointing men stood about many a building, looking at long\r\nzig- zag cracks that extended from the eaves to the ground. Four feet of\r\nthe tops of three chimneys on one house were broken square off and\r\nturned around in such a way as to completely stop the draft.\r\n\r\nA crack a hundred feet long gaped open six inches wide in the middle of\r\none street and then shut together again with such force, as to ridge up\r\nthe meeting earth like a slender grave. A lady sitting in her rocking\r\nand quaking parlor, saw the wall part at the ceiling, open and shut\r\ntwice, like a mouth, and then drop the end of a brick on the floor like\r\na tooth. She was a woman easily disgusted with foolishness, and she\r\narose and went out of there. One lady who was coming down stairs was\r\nastonished to see a bronze Hercules lean forward on its pedestal as if\r\nto strike her with its club. They both reached the bottom of the flight\r\nat the same time,\xe2\x80\x94the woman insensible from the fright. Her child, born\r\nsome little time afterward, was club-footed. However\xe2\x80\x94on second\r\nthought,\xe2\x80\x94if the reader sees any coincidence in this, he must do it at\r\nhis own risk.\r\n\r\nThe first shock brought down two or three huge organ-pipes in one of the\r\nchurches. The minister, with uplifted hands, was just closing the\r\nservices. He glanced up, hesitated, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we will omit the benediction!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the next instant there was\r\na vacancy in the atmosphere where he had stood.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shock, an Oakland minister said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKeep your seats! There is no better place to die than this\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nAnd added, after the third:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut outside is good enough!\xe2\x80\x9d He then skipped out at the back door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n426.jpg (40K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch another destruction of mantel ornaments and toilet bottles as the\r\nearthquake created, San Francisco never saw before. There was hardly a\r\ngirl or a matron in the city but suffered losses of this kind. Suspended\r\npictures were thrown down, but oftener still, by a curious freak of the\r\nearthquake\xe2\x80\x99s humor, they were whirled completely around with their faces\r\nto the wall! There was great difference of opinion, at first, as to the\r\ncourse or direction the earthquake traveled, but water that splashed out\r\nof various tanks and buckets settled that. Thousands of people were made\r\nso sea-sick by the rolling and pitching of floors and streets that they\r\nwere weak and bed-ridden for hours, and some few for even days\r\nafterward.\xe2\x80\x94Hardly an individual escaped nausea entirely.\r\n\r\nThe queer earthquake\xe2\x80\x94episodes that formed the staple of San Francisco\r\ngossip for the next week would fill a much larger book than this, and so\r\nI will diverge from the subject.\r\n\r\nBy and by, in the due course of things, I picked up a copy of the\r\nEnterprise one day, and fell under this cruel blow:\r\n\r\nNEVADA MINES IN NEW YORK.\xe2\x80\x94G. M. Marshall, Sheba Hurs and Amos H. Rose,\r\nwho left San Francisco last July for New York City, with ores from mines\r\nin Pine Wood District, Humboldt County, and on the Reese River range,\r\nhave disposed of a mine containing six thousand feet and called the Pine\r\nMountains Consolidated, for the sum of $3,000,000. The stamps on the\r\ndeed, which is now on its way to Humboldt County, from New York, for\r\nrecord, amounted to $3,000, which is said to be the largest amount of\r\nstamps ever placed on one document. A working capital of $1,000,000 has\r\nbeen paid into the treasury, and machinery has already been purchased\r\nfor a large quartz mill, which will be put up as soon as possible. The\r\nstock in this company is all full paid and entirely unassessable. The\r\nores of the mines in this district somewhat resemble those of the Sheba\r\nmine in Humboldt. Sheba Hurst, the discoverer of the mines, with his\r\nfriends corralled all the best leads and all the land and timber they\r\ndesired before making public their whereabouts. Ores from there, assayed\r\nin this city, showed them to be exceedingly rich in silver and\r\ngold\xe2\x80\x94silver predominating. There is an abundance of wood and water in\r\nthe District. We are glad to know that New York capital has been\r\nenlisted in the development of the mines of this region. Having seen the\r\nores and assays, we are satisfied that the mines of the District are\r\nvery valuable\xe2\x80\x94anything but wild-cat.\r\n\r\nOnce more native imbecility had carried the day, and I had lost a\r\nmillion! It was the \xe2\x80\x9cblind lead\xe2\x80\x9d over again.\r\n\r\nLet us not dwell on this miserable matter. If I were inventing these\r\nthings, I could be wonderfully humorous over them; but they are too true\r\nto be talked of with hearty levity, even at this distant day. [True, and\r\nyet not exactly as given in the above figures, possibly. I saw Marshall,\r\nmonths afterward, and although he had plenty of money he did not claim\r\nto have captured an entire million. In fact I gathered that he had not\r\nthen received $50,000. Beyond that figure his fortune appeared to\r\nconsist of uncertain vast expectations rather than prodigious\r\ncertainties. However, when the above item appeared in print I put full\r\nfaith in it, and incontinently wilted and went to seed under it.]\r\nSuffice it that I so lost heart, and so yielded myself up to repinings\r\nand sighings and foolish regrets, that I neglected my duties and became\r\nabout worthless, as a reporter for a brisk newspaper. And at last one of\r\nthe proprietors took me aside, with a charity I still remember with\r\nconsiderable respect, and gave me an opportunity to resign my berth and\r\nso save myself the disgrace of a dismissal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time I wrote literary screeds for the Golden Era. C. H. Webb had\r\nestablished a very excellent literary weekly called the Californian, but\r\nhigh merit was no guaranty of success; it languished, and he sold out to\r\nthree printers, and Bret Harte became editor at $20 a week, and I was\r\nemployed to contribute an article a week at $12. But the journal still\r\nlanguished, and the printers sold out to Captain Ogden, a rich man and a\r\npleasant gentleman who chose to amuse himself with such an expensive\r\nluxury without much caring about the cost of it. When he grew tired of\r\nthe novelty, he re-sold to the printers, the paper presently died a\r\npeaceful death, and I was out of work again. I would not mention these\r\nthings but for the fact that they so aptly illustrate the ups and downs\r\nthat characterize life on the Pacific coast. A man could hardly stumble\r\ninto such a variety of queer vicissitudes in any other country.\r\n\r\nFor two months my sole occupation was avoiding acquaintances; for during\r\nthat time I did not earn a penny, or buy an article of any kind, or pay\r\nmy board. I became a very adept at \xe2\x80\x9cslinking.\xe2\x80\x9d I slunk from back street\r\nto back street, I slunk away from approaching faces that looked\r\nfamiliar, I slunk to my meals, ate them humbly and with a mute apology\r\nfor every mouthful I robbed my generous landlady of, and at midnight,\r\nafter wanderings that were but slinkings away from cheerfulness and\r\nlight, I slunk to my bed. I felt meaner, and lowlier and more despicable\r\nthan the worms. During all this time I had but one piece of money\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsilver ten cent piece\xe2\x80\x94and I held to it and would not spend it on any\r\naccount, lest the consciousness coming strong upon me that I was\r\nentirely penniless, might suggest suicide. I had pawned every thing but\r\nthe clothes I had on; so I clung to my dime desperately, till it was\r\nsmooth with handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n429.jpg (36K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I am forgetting. I did have one other occupation beside that of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cslinking.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the entertaining of a collector (and being\r\nentertained by him,) who had in his hands the Virginia banker\xe2\x80\x99s bill for\r\nforty-six dollars which I had loaned my schoolmate, the \xe2\x80\x9cProdigal.\xe2\x80\x9d This\r\nman used to call regularly once a week and dun me, and sometimes\r\noftener. He did it from sheer force of habit, for he knew he could get\r\nnothing. He would get out his bill, calculate the interest for me, at\r\nfive per cent a month, and show me clearly that there was no attempt at\r\nfraud in it and no mistakes; and then plead, and argue and dun with all\r\nhis might for any sum\xe2\x80\x94any little trifle\xe2\x80\x94even a dollar\xe2\x80\x94even half a\r\ndollar, on account. Then his duty was accomplished and his conscience\r\nfree. He immediately dropped the subject there always; got out a couple\r\nof cigars and divided, put his feet in the window, and then we would\r\nhave a long, luxurious talk about everything and everybody, and he would\r\nfurnish me a world of curious dunning adventures out of the ample store\r\nin his memory. By and by he would clap his hat on his head, shake hands\r\nand say briskly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, business is business\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t stay with you always!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and was off in\r\na second.\r\n\r\nThe idea of pining for a dun! And yet I used to long for him to come,\r\nand would get as uneasy as any mother if the day went by without his\r\nvisit, when I was expecting him. But he never collected that bill, at\r\nlast nor any part of it. I lived to pay it to the banker myself.\r\n\r\nMisery loves company. Now and then at night, in out-of-the way, dimly\r\nlighted places, I found myself happening on another child of misfortune.\r\nHe looked so seedy and forlorn, so homeless and friendless and forsaken,\r\nthat I yearned toward him as a brother. I wanted to claim kinship with\r\nhim and go about and enjoy our wretchedness together. The drawing toward\r\neach other must have been mutual; at any rate we got to falling together\r\noftener, though still seemingly by accident; and although we did not\r\nspeak or evince any recognition, I think the dull anxiety passed out of\r\nboth of us when we saw each other, and then for several hours we would\r\nidle along contentedly, wide apart, and glancing furtively in at home\r\nlights and fireside gatherings, out of the night shadows, and very much\r\nenjoying our dumb companionship.\r\n\r\nFinally we spoke, and were inseparable after that. For our woes were\r\nidentical, almost. He had been a reporter too, and lost his berth, and\r\nthis was his experience, as nearly as I can recollect it. After losing\r\nhis berth he had gone down, down, down, with never a halt: from a\r\nboarding house on Russian Hill to a boarding house in Kearney street;\r\nfrom thence to Dupont; from thence to a low sailor den; and from thence\r\nto lodgings in goods boxes and empty hogsheads near the wharves. Then;\r\nfor a while, he had gained a meagre living by sewing up bursted sacks of\r\ngrain on the piers; when that failed he had found food here and there as\r\nchance threw it in his way. He had ceased to show his face in daylight,\r\nnow, for a reporter knows everybody, rich and poor, high and low, and\r\ncannot well avoid familiar faces in the broad light of day.\r\n\r\nThis mendicant Blucher\xe2\x80\x94I call him that for convenience\xe2\x80\x94was a splendid\r\ncreature. He was full of hope, pluck and philosophy; he was well read\r\nand a man of cultivated taste; he had a bright wit and was a master of\r\nsatire; his kindliness and his generous spirit made him royal in my eyes\r\nand changed his curb-stone seat to a throne and his damaged hat to a\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nHe had an adventure, once, which sticks fast in my memory as the most\r\npleasantly grotesque that ever touched my sympathies. He had been\r\nwithout a penny for two months. He had shirked about obscure streets,\r\namong friendly dim lights, till the thing had become second nature to\r\nhim. But at last he was driven abroad in daylight. The cause was\r\nsufficient; _he had not tasted food for forty-eight hours_, and he could\r\nnot endure the misery of his hunger in idle hiding. He came along a back\r\nstreet, glowering at the loaves in bake-shop windows, and feeling that\r\nhe could trade his life away for a morsel to eat. The sight of the bread\r\ndoubled his hunger; but it was good to look at it, any how, and imagine\r\nwhat one might do if one only had it.\r\n\r\nPresently, in the middle of the street he saw a shining spot\xe2\x80\x94looked\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94did not, and could not, believe his eyes\xe2\x80\x94turned away, to try them,\r\nthen looked again. It was a verity\xe2\x80\x94no vain, hunger-inspired delusion\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas a silver dime!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n431.jpg (31K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe snatched it\xe2\x80\x94gloated over it; doubted it\xe2\x80\x94bit it\xe2\x80\x94found it\r\ngenuine\xe2\x80\x94choked his heart down, and smothered a halleluiah. Then he\r\nlooked around\xe2\x80\x94saw that nobody was looking at him\xe2\x80\x94threw the dime down\r\nwhere it was before\xe2\x80\x94walked away a few steps, and approached again,\r\npretending he did not know it was there, so that he could re-enjoy the\r\nluxury of finding it. He walked around it, viewing it from different\r\npoints; then sauntered about with his hands in his pockets, looking up\r\nat the signs and now and then glancing at it and feeling the old thrill\r\nagain. Finally he took it up, and went away, fondling it in his pocket.\r\nHe idled through unfrequented streets, stopping in doorways and corners\r\nto take it out and look at it. By and by he went home to his lodgings\xe2\x80\x94an\r\nempty queens-ware hogshead,\xe2\x80\x94and employed himself till night trying to\r\nmake up his mind what to buy with it. But it was hard to do. To get the\r\nmost for it was the idea. He knew that at the Miner\xe2\x80\x99s Restaurant he\r\ncould get a plate of beans and a piece of bread for ten cents; or a\r\nfish-ball and some few trifles, but they gave \xe2\x80\x9cno bread with one fish-\r\nball\xe2\x80\x9d there. At French Pete\xe2\x80\x99s he could get a veal cutlet, plain, and\r\nsome radishes and bread, for ten cents; or a cup of coffee\xe2\x80\x94a pint at\r\nleast\xe2\x80\x94and a slice of bread; but the slice was not thick enough by the\r\neighth of an inch, and sometimes they were still more criminal than that\r\nin the cutting of it. At seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock his hunger was wolfish; and still\r\nhis mind was not made up. He turned out and went up Merchant street,\r\nstill ciphering; and chewing a bit of stick, as is the way of starving\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n432.jpg (38K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe passed before the lights of Martin\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant, the most\r\naristocratic in the city, and stopped. It was a place where he had often\r\ndined, in better days, and Martin knew him well. Standing aside, just\r\nout of the range of the light, he worshiped the quails and steaks in the\r\nshow window, and imagined that may be the fairy times were not gone yet\r\nand some prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him to\r\ngo in there and take whatever he wanted. He chewed his stick with a\r\nhungry interest as he warmed to his subject. Just at this juncture he\r\nwas conscious of some one at his side, sure enough; and then a finger\r\ntouched his arm. He looked up, over his shoulder, and saw an\r\napparition\xe2\x80\x94a very allegory of Hunger! It was a man six feet high, gaunt,\r\nunshaven, hung with rags; with a haggard face and sunken cheeks, and\r\neyes that pleaded piteously. This phantom said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me\xe2\x80\x94please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe locked his arm in Blucher\xe2\x80\x99s and walked up the street to where the\r\npassengers were few and the light not strong, and then facing about, put\r\nout his hands in a beseeching way, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFriend\xe2\x80\x94stranger\xe2\x80\x94look at me! Life is easy to you\xe2\x80\x94you go about, placid\r\nand content, as I did once, in my day\xe2\x80\x94you have been in there, and eaten\r\nyour sumptuous supper, and picked your teeth, and hummed your tune, and\r\nthought your pleasant thoughts, and said to yourself it is a good\r\nworld\xe2\x80\x94but you\xe2\x80\x99ve never _suffered_! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what trouble is\xe2\x80\x94you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what misery is\xe2\x80\x94nor hunger! Look at me! Stranger have pity on\r\na poor friendless, homeless dog! As God is my judge, I have not tasted\r\nfood for eight and forty hours!\xe2\x80\x94look in my eyes and see if I lie! Give\r\nme the least trifle in the world to keep me from\r\nstarving\xe2\x80\x94anything\xe2\x80\x94twenty-five cents! Do it, stranger\xe2\x80\x94do it, _please_. It\r\nwill be nothing to you, but life to me. Do it, and I will go down on my\r\nknees and lick the dust before you! I will kiss your footprints\xe2\x80\x94I will\r\nworship the very ground you walk on! Only twenty-five cents! I am\r\nfamishing\xe2\x80\x94perishing\xe2\x80\x94starving by inches! For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t desert me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n433.jpg (71K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlucher was bewildered\xe2\x80\x94and touched, too\xe2\x80\x94stirred to the depths. He\r\nreflected. Thought again. Then an idea struck him, and he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the outcast\xe2\x80\x99s arm, walked him down to Martin\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant,\r\nseated him at a marble table, placed the bill of fare before him, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrder what you want, friend. Charge it to me, Mr. Martin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Mr. Blucher,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin.\r\n\r\nThen Blucher stepped back and leaned against the counter and watched the\r\nman stow away cargo after cargo of buckwheat cakes at seventy-five cents\r\na plate; cup after cup of coffee, and porter house steaks worth two\r\ndollars apiece; and when six dollars and a half\xe2\x80\x99s worth of destruction\r\nhad been accomplished, and the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s hunger appeased, Blucher went\r\ndown to French Pete\xe2\x80\x99s, bought a veal cutlet plain, a slice of bread, and\r\nthree radishes, with his dime, and set to and feasted like a king!\r\n\r\nTake the episode all around, it was as odd as any that can be culled\r\nfrom the myriad curiosities of Californian life, perhaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by, an old friend of mine, a miner, came down from one of the\r\ndecayed mining camps of Tuolumne, California, and I went back with him.\r\nWe lived in a small cabin on a verdant hillside, and there were not five\r\nother cabins in view over the wide expanse of hill and forest. Yet a\r\nflourishing city of two or three thousand population had occupied this\r\ngrassy dead solitude during the flush times of twelve or fifteen years\r\nbefore, and where our cabin stood had once been the heart of the teeming\r\nhive, the centre of the city. When the mines gave out the town fell into\r\ndecay, and in a few years wholly disappeared\xe2\x80\x94streets, dwellings, shops,\r\neverything\xe2\x80\x94and left no sign. The grassy slopes were as green and smooth\r\nand desolate of life as if they had never been disturbed. The mere\r\nhandful of miners still remaining, had seen the town spring up spread,\r\ngrow and flourish in its pride; and they had seen it sicken and die, and\r\npass away like a dream. With it their hopes had died, and their zest of\r\nlife. They had long ago resigned themselves to their exile, and ceased\r\nto correspond with their distant friends or turn longing eyes toward\r\ntheir early homes. They had accepted banishment, forgotten the world and\r\nbeen forgotten of the world. They were far from telegraphs and\r\nrailroads, and they stood, as it were, in a living grave, dead to the\r\nevents that stirred the globe\xe2\x80\x99s great populations, dead to the common\r\ninterests of men, isolated and outcast from brotherhood with their kind.\r\nIt was the most singular, and almost the most touching and melancholy\r\nexile that fancy can imagine.\xe2\x80\x94One of my associates in this locality, for\r\ntwo or three months, was a man who had had a university education; but\r\nnow for eighteen years he had decayed there by inches, a bearded, rough-\r\nclad, clay-stained miner, and at times, among his sighings and\r\nsoliloquizings, he unconsciously interjected vaguely remembered Latin\r\nand Greek sentences\xe2\x80\x94dead and musty tongues, meet vehicles for the\r\nthoughts of one whose dreams were all of the past, whose life was a\r\nfailure; a tired man, burdened with the present, and indifferent to the\r\nfuture; a man without ties, hopes, interests, waiting for rest and the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n436.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that one little corner of California is found a species of mining\r\nwhich is seldom or never mentioned in print. It is called \xe2\x80\x9cpocket\r\nmining\xe2\x80\x9d and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little\r\ncorner. The gold is not evenly distributed through the surface dirt, as\r\nin ordinary placer mines, but is collected in little spots, and they are\r\nvery wide apart and exceedingly hard to find, but when you do find one\r\nyou reap a rich and sudden harvest. There are not now more than twenty\r\npocket miners in that entire little region. I think I know every one of\r\nthem personally. I have known one of them to hunt patiently about the\r\nhill-sides every day for eight months without finding gold enough to\r\nmake a snuff-box\xe2\x80\x94his grocery bill running up relentlessly all the\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94and then find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollars in\r\ntwo dips of his shovel. I have known him to take out three thousand\r\ndollars in two hours, and go and pay up every cent of his indebtedness,\r\nthen enter on a dazzling spree that finished the last of his treasure\r\nbefore the night was gone. And the next day he bought his groceries on\r\ncredit as usual, and shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the\r\nhills hunting pockets again happy and content. This is the most\r\nfascinating of all the different kinds of mining, and furnishes a very\r\nhandsome percentage of victims to the lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\nPocket hunting is an ingenious process. You take a spadeful of earth\r\nfrom the hill-side and put it in a large tin pan and dissolve and wash\r\nit gradually away till nothing is left but a teaspoonful of fine\r\nsediment. Whatever gold was in that earth has remained, because, being\r\nthe heaviest, it has sought the bottom. Among the sediment you will find\r\nhalf a dozen yellow particles no larger than pin-heads. You are\r\ndelighted. You move off to one side and wash another pan. If you find\r\ngold again, you move to one side further, and wash a third pan. If you\r\nfind _no_ gold this time, you are delighted again, because you know you\r\nare on the right scent.\r\n\r\nYou lay an imaginary plan, shaped like a fan, with its handle up the\r\nhill\xe2\x80\x94for just where the end of the handle is, you argue that the rich\r\ndeposit lies hidden, whose vagrant grains of gold have escaped and been\r\nwashed down the hill, spreading farther and farther apart as they\r\nwandered. And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and\r\nnarrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows\r\nthat you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up\r\nthe hill your lines have converged to a point\xe2\x80\x94a single foot from that\r\npoint you cannot find any gold. Your breath comes short and quick, you\r\nare feverish with excitement; the dinner-bell may ring its clapper off,\r\nyou pay no attention; friends may die, weddings transpire, houses burn\r\ndown, they are nothing to you; you sweat and dig and delve with a\r\nfrantic interest\xe2\x80\x94and all at once you strike it! Up comes a spadeful of\r\nearth and quartz that is all lovely with soiled lumps and leaves and\r\nsprays of gold. Sometimes that one spadeful is all\xe2\x80\x94$500. Sometimes the\r\nnest contains $10,000, and it takes you three or four days to get it all\r\nout. The pocket-miners tell of one nest that yielded $60,000 and two men\r\nexhausted it in two weeks, and then sold the ground for $10,000 to a\r\nparty who never got $300 out of it afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n437.jpg (37K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hogs are good pocket hunters. All the summer they root around the\r\nbushes, and turn up a thousand little piles of dirt, and then the miners\r\nlong for the rains; for the rains beat upon these little piles and wash\r\nthem down and expose the gold, possibly right over a pocket. Two pockets\r\nwere found in this way by the same man in one day. One had $5,000 in it\r\nand the other $8,000. That man could appreciate it, for he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a\r\ncent for about a year.\r\n\r\nIn Tuolumne lived two miners who used to go to the neighboring village\r\nin the afternoon and return every night with household supplies. Part of\r\nthe distance they traversed a trail, and nearly always sat down to rest\r\non a great boulder that lay beside the path. In the course of thirteen\r\nyears they had worn that boulder tolerably smooth, sitting on it. By and\r\nby two vagrant Mexicans came along and occupied the seat. They began to\r\namuse themselves by chipping off flakes from the boulder with a sledge-\r\nhammer. They examined one of these flakes and found it rich with gold.\r\nThat boulder paid them $800 afterward. But the aggravating circumstance\r\nwas that these \xe2\x80\x9cGreasers\xe2\x80\x9d knew that there must be more gold where that\r\nboulder came from, and so they went panning up the hill and found what\r\nwas probably the richest pocket that region has yet produced. It took\r\nthree months to exhaust it, and it yielded $120,000. The two American\r\nminers who used to sit on the boulder are poor yet, and they take turn\r\nabout in getting up early in the morning to curse those Mexicans\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwhen it comes down to pure ornamental cursing, the native American is\r\ngifted above the sons of men.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length upon this matter of pocket mining because it\r\nis a subject that is seldom referred to in print, and therefore I judged\r\nthat it would have for the reader that interest which naturally attaches\r\nto novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my comrades there\xe2\x80\x94another of those victims of eighteen years of\r\nunrequited toil and blighted hopes\xe2\x80\x94was one of the gentlest spirits that\r\never bore its patient cross in a weary exile: grave and simple Dick\r\nBaker, pocket-miner of Dead-House Gulch.\xe2\x80\x94He was forty-six, gray as a\r\nrat, earnest, thoughtful, slenderly educated, slouchily dressed and\r\nclay-soiled, but his heart was finer metal than any gold his shovel ever\r\nbrought to light\xe2\x80\x94than any, indeed, that ever was mined or minted.\r\n\r\nWhenever he was out of luck and a little down-hearted, he would fall to\r\nmourning over the loss of a wonderful cat he used to own (for where\r\nwomen and children are not, men of kindly impulses take up with pets,\r\nfor they must love something). And he always spoke of the strange\r\nsagacity of that cat with the air of a man who believed in his secret\r\nheart that there was something human about it\xe2\x80\x94may be even supernatural.\r\n\r\nI heard him talking about this animal once. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n440.jpg (18K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, I used to have a cat here, by the name of Tom Quartz, which\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d a took an interest in I reckon\xe2\x80\x94most any body would. I had him here\r\neight year\xe2\x80\x94and he was the remarkablest cat _I_ ever see. He was a large\r\ngray one of the Tom specie, an\xe2\x80\x99 he had more hard, natchral sense than\r\nany man in this camp\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 a _power_ of dignity\xe2\x80\x94he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the\r\nGov\xe2\x80\x99ner of Californy be familiar with him. He never ketched a rat in his\r\nlife\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99peared to be above it. He never cared for nothing but mining. He\r\nknowed more about mining, that cat did, than any man _I_ ever, ever see.\r\nYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell _him_ noth\xe2\x80\x99n \xe2\x80\x99bout placer diggin\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 as for pocket\r\nmining, why he was just born for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would dig out after me an\xe2\x80\x99 Jim when we went over the hills\r\nprospect\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99, and he would trot along behind us for as much as five mile,\r\nif we went so fur. An\xe2\x80\x99 he had the best judgment about mining ground\xe2\x80\x94why\r\nyou never see anything like it. When we went to work, he\xe2\x80\x99d scatter a\r\nglance around, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think much of the indications, he would\r\ngive a look as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get you to excuse\r\n_me_,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 without another word he\xe2\x80\x99d hyste his nose into the air \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshove for home. But if the ground suited him, he would lay low \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 keep\r\ndark till the first pan was washed, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 then he would sidle up \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 take\r\na look, an\xe2\x80\x99 if there was about six or seven grains of gold _he_ was\r\nsatisfied\xe2\x80\x94he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want no better prospect \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 that\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 then he would\r\nlay down on our coats and snore like a steamboat till we\xe2\x80\x99d struck the\r\npocket, an\xe2\x80\x99 then get up \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 superintend. He was nearly lightnin\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nsuperintending.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, bye an\xe2\x80\x99 bye, up comes this yer quartz excitement. Every body was\r\ninto it\xe2\x80\x94every body was pick\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 blast\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 instead of shovelin\xe2\x80\x99 dirt on\r\nthe hill side\xe2\x80\x94every body was put\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 down a shaft instead of scrapin\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nsurface. Noth\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 would do Jim, but _we_ must tackle the ledges, too, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99\r\nso we did. We commenced put\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 down a shaft, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 Tom Quartz he begin to\r\nwonder what in the Dickens it was all about. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t ever seen any\r\nmining like that before, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 he was all upset, as you may say\xe2\x80\x94he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to a right understanding of it no way\xe2\x80\x94it was too many for\r\n_him_. He was down on it, too, you bet you\xe2\x80\x94he was down on it\r\npowerful\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 always appeared to consider it the cussedest foolishness\r\nout. But that cat, you know, was _always_ agin new fangled\r\narrangements\xe2\x80\x94somehow he never could abide\xe2\x80\x99em. _You_ know how it is with\r\nold habits. But by an\xe2\x80\x99 by Tom Quartz begin to git sort of reconciled a\r\nlittle, though he never _could_ altogether understand that eternal\r\nsinkin\xe2\x80\x99 of a shaft an\xe2\x80\x99 never pannin\xe2\x80\x99 out any thing. At last he got to\r\ncomin\xe2\x80\x99 down in the shaft, hisself, to try to cipher it out. An\xe2\x80\x99 when\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d git the blues, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 feel kind o\xe2\x80\x99scruffy, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 aggravated \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndisgusted\xe2\x80\x94knowin\xe2\x80\x99 as he did, that the bills was runnin\xe2\x80\x99 up all the time\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99 we warn\xe2\x80\x99t makin\xe2\x80\x99 a cent\xe2\x80\x94he would curl up on a gunny sack in the\r\ncorner an\xe2\x80\x99 go to sleep. Well, one day when the shaft was down about\r\neight foot, the rock got so hard that we had to put in a blast\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\nblast\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99d ever done since Tom Quartz was born. An\xe2\x80\x99 then we lit the\r\nfuse \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 clumb out \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 got off \xe2\x80\x99bout fifty yards\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 forgot \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 left Tom\r\nQuartz sound asleep on the gunny sack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n441.jpg (89K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn \xe2\x80\x99bout a minute we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the hole, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthen everything let go with an awful crash, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 about four million ton\r\nof rocks \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 dirt \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 smoke \xe2\x80\x99n; splinters shot up \xe2\x80\x99bout a mile an\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nhalf into the air, an\xe2\x80\x99 by George, right in the dead centre of it was old\r\nTom Quartz a goin\xe2\x80\x99 end over end, an\xe2\x80\x99 a snortin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 a sneez\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99, an\xe2\x80\x99 a\r\nclawin\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 a reachin\xe2\x80\x99 for things like all possessed. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no\r\nuse, you know, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use. An\xe2\x80\x99 that was the last we see of _him_\r\nfor about two minutes \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 a half, an\xe2\x80\x99 then all of a sudden it begin to\r\nrain rocks and rubbage, an\xe2\x80\x99 directly he come down ker-whop about ten\r\nfoot off f\xe2\x80\x99m where we stood Well, I reckon he was p\xe2\x80\x99raps the orneriest\r\nlookin\xe2\x80\x99 beast you ever see. One ear was sot back on his neck, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 his\r\ntail was stove up, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 his eye-winkers was swinged off, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 he was all\r\nblacked up with powder an\xe2\x80\x99 smoke, an\xe2\x80\x99 all sloppy with mud \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 slush f\xe2\x80\x99m\r\none end to the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell sir, it warn\xe2\x80\x99t no use to try to apologize\xe2\x80\x94we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say a word.\r\nHe took a sort of a disgusted look at hisself, \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 then he looked at\r\nus\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 it was just exactly the same as if he had said\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99Gents, may be\r\n_you_ think it\xe2\x80\x99s smart to take advantage of a cat that \xe2\x80\x99ain\xe2\x80\x99t had no\r\nexperience of quartz minin\xe2\x80\x99, but _I_ think _different_\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94an\xe2\x80\x99 then he\r\nturned on his heel \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 marched off home without ever saying another\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n442.jpg (16K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was jest his style. An\xe2\x80\x99 may be you won\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, but after\r\nthat you never see a cat so prejudiced agin quartz mining as what he\r\nwas. An\xe2\x80\x99 by an\xe2\x80\x99 bye when he _did_ get to goin\xe2\x80\x99 down in the shaft agin,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x99a been astonished at his sagacity. The minute we\xe2\x80\x99d tetch off a\r\nblast \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 the fuse\xe2\x80\x99d begin to sizzle, he\xe2\x80\x99d give a look as much as to\r\nsay: \xe2\x80\x99Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to git you to excuse _me_,\xe2\x80\x99 an\xe2\x80\x99 it was surpris\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthe way he\xe2\x80\x99d shin out of that hole \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 go f\xe2\x80\x99r a tree. Sagacity? It ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno name for it. \xe2\x80\x99Twas _inspiration_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Baker, his prejudice against quartz-mining _was_\r\nremarkable, considering how he came by it. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever cure him of\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Cure him!_ No! When Tom Quartz was sot once, he was _always_ sot\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nyou might a blowed him up as much as three million times \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 you\xe2\x80\x99d never\r\na broken him of his cussed prejudice agin quartz mining.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe affection and the pride that lit up Baker\xe2\x80\x99s face when he delivered\r\nthis tribute to the firmness of his humble friend of other days, will\r\nalways be a vivid memory with me.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two months we had never \xe2\x80\x9cstruck\xe2\x80\x9d a pocket. We had panned\r\nup and down the hillsides till they looked plowed like a field; we could\r\nhave put in a crop of grain, then, but there would have been no way to\r\nget it to market. We got many good \xe2\x80\x9cprospects,\xe2\x80\x9d but when the gold gave\r\nout in the pan and we dug down, hoping and longing, we found only\r\nemptiness\xe2\x80\x94the pocket that should have been there was as barren as our\r\nown.\xe2\x80\x94At last we shouldered our pans and shovels and struck out over the\r\nhills to try new localities. We prospected around Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Camp, in\r\nCalaveras county, during three weeks, but had no success. Then we\r\nwandered on foot among the mountains, sleeping under the trees at night,\r\nfor the weather was mild, but still we remained as centless as the last\r\nrose of summer. That is a poor joke, but it is in pathetic harmony with\r\nthe circumstances, since we were so poor ourselves. In accordance with\r\nthe custom of the country, our door had always stood open and our board\r\nwelcome to tramping miners\xe2\x80\x94they drifted along nearly every day, dumped\r\ntheir paust shovels by the threshold and took \xe2\x80\x9cpot luck\xe2\x80\x9d with us\xe2\x80\x94and now\r\non our own tramp we never found cold hospitality.\r\n\r\nOur wanderings were wide and in many directions; and now I could give\r\nthe reader a vivid description of the Big Trees and the marvels of the\r\nYo Semite\xe2\x80\x94but what has this reader done to me that I should persecute\r\nhim? I will deliver him into the hands of less conscientious tourists\r\nand take his blessing. Let me be charitable, though I fail in all\r\nvirtues else.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of the phrases in the above are mining technicalities,\r\npurely, and may be a little obscure to the general reader. In \xe2\x80\x9cplacer\r\ndiggings\xe2\x80\x9d the gold is scattered all through the surface dirt; in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cpocket\xe2\x80\x9d diggings it is concentrated in one little spot; in \xe2\x80\x9cquartz\xe2\x80\x9d the\r\ngold is in a solid, continuous vein of rock, enclosed between distinct\r\nwalls of some other kind of stone\xe2\x80\x94and this is the most laborious and\r\nexpensive of all the different kinds of mining. \xe2\x80\x9cProspecting\xe2\x80\x9d is hunting\r\nfor a \xe2\x80\x9cplacer\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cindications\xe2\x80\x9d are signs of its presence; \xe2\x80\x9cpanning out\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nrefers to the washing process by which the grains of gold are separated\r\nfrom the dirt; a \xe2\x80\x9cprospect\xe2\x80\x9d is what one finds in the first panful of\r\ndirt\xe2\x80\x94and its value determines whether it is a good or a bad prospect,\r\nand whether it is worth while to tarry there or seek further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a three months\xe2\x80\x99 absence, I found myself in San Francisco again,\r\nwithout a cent. When my credit was about exhausted, (for I had become\r\ntoo mean and lazy, now, to work on a morning paper, and there were no\r\nvacancies on the evening journals,) I was created San Francisco\r\ncorrespondent of the _Enterprise_, and at the end of five months I was\r\nout of debt, but my interest in my work was gone; for my correspondence\r\nbeing a daily one, without rest or respite, I got unspeakably tired of\r\nit. I wanted another change. The vagabond instinct was strong upon me.\r\nFortune favored and I got a new berth and a delightful one. It was to go\r\ndown to the Sandwich Islands and write some letters for the Sacramento\r\n_Union_, an excellent journal and liberal with employees.\r\n\r\nWe sailed in the propeller _Ajax_, in the middle of winter. The almanac\r\ncalled it winter, distinctly enough, but the weather was a compromise\r\nbetween spring and summer. Six days out of port, it became summer\r\naltogether. We had some thirty passengers; among them a cheerful soul by\r\nthe name of Williams, and three sea-worn old whaleship captains going\r\ndown to join their vessels. These latter played euchre in the smoking\r\nroom day and night, drank astonishing quantities of raw whisky without\r\nbeing in the least affected by it, and were the happiest people I think\r\nI ever saw. And then there was \xe2\x80\x9cthe old Admiral\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d a retired whaleman. He\r\nwas a roaring, terrific combination of wind and lightning and thunder,\r\nand earnest, whole-souled profanity. But nevertheless he was tender-\r\nhearted as a girl. He was a raving, deafening, devastating typhoon,\r\nlaying waste the cowering seas but with an unvexed refuge in the centre\r\nwhere all comers were safe and at rest. Nobody could know the \xe2\x80\x9cAdmiral\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwithout liking him; and in a sudden and dire emergency I think no friend\r\nof his would know which to choose\xe2\x80\x94to be cursed by him or prayed for by a\r\nless efficient person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n445.jpg (65K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Title of \xe2\x80\x9cAdmiral\xe2\x80\x9d was more strictly \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d than any ever worn\r\nby a naval officer before or since, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94for it was the voluntary\r\noffering of a whole nation, and came direct from the _people_ themselves\r\nwithout any intermediate red tape\xe2\x80\x94the people of the Sandwich Islands. It\r\nwas a title that came to him freighted with affection, and honor, and\r\nappreciation of his unpretending merit. And in testimony of the\r\ngenuineness of the title it was publicly ordained that an exclusive flag\r\nshould be devised for him and used solely to welcome his coming and wave\r\nhim God-speed in his going. From that time forth, whenever his ship was\r\nsignaled in the offing, or he catted his anchor and stood out to sea,\r\nthat ensign streamed from the royal halliards on the parliament house\r\nand the nation lifted their hats to it with spontaneous accord.\r\n\r\nYet he had never fired a gun or fought a battle in his life. When I knew\r\nhim on board the _Ajax_, he was seventy-two years old and had plowed the\r\nsalt water sixty-one of them. For sixteen years he had gone in and out\r\nof the harbor of Honolulu in command of a whaleship, and for sixteen\r\nmore had been captain of a San Francisco and Sandwich Island passenger\r\npacket and had never had an accident or lost a vessel. The simple\r\nnatives knew him for a friend who never failed them, and regarded him as\r\nchildren regard a father. It was a dangerous thing to oppress them when\r\nthe roaring Admiral was around.\r\n\r\nTwo years before I knew the Admiral, he had retired from the sea on a\r\ncompetence, and had sworn a colossal nine-jointed oath that he would\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cnever go within _smelling_ distance of the salt water again as long as\r\nhe lived.\xe2\x80\x9d And he had conscientiously kept it. That is to say, _he_\r\nconsidered he had kept it, and it would have been more than dangerous to\r\nsuggest to him, even in the gentlest way, that making eleven long sea\r\nvoyages, as a passenger, during the two years that had transpired since\r\nhe \xe2\x80\x9cretired,\xe2\x80\x9d was only keeping the general spirit of it and not the\r\nstrict letter.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral knew only one narrow line of conduct to pursue in any and\r\nall cases where there was a fight, and that was to shoulder his way\r\nstraight in without an inquiry as to the rights or the merits of it, and\r\ntake the part of the weaker side.\xe2\x80\x94And this was the reason why he was\r\nalways sure to be present at the trial of any universally execrated\r\ncriminal to oppress and intimidate the jury with a vindictive pantomime\r\nof what he would do to them if he ever caught them out of the box. And\r\nthis was why harried cats and outlawed dogs that knew him confidently\r\ntook sanctuary under his chair in time of trouble. In the beginning he\r\nwas the most frantic and bloodthirsty Union man that drew breath in the\r\nshadow of the Flag; but the instant the Southerners began to go down\r\nbefore the sweep of the Northern armies, he ran up the Confederate\r\ncolors and from that time till the end was a rampant and inexorable\r\nsecessionist.\r\n\r\nHe hated intemperance with a more uncompromising animosity than any\r\nindividual I have ever met, of either sex; and he was never tired of\r\nstorming against it and beseeching friends and strangers alike to be\r\nwary and drink with moderation. And yet if any creature had been\r\nguileless enough to intimate that his absorbing nine gallons of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstraight\xe2\x80\x9d whiskey during our voyage was any fraction short of rigid or\r\ninflexible abstemiousness, in that self-same moment the old man would\r\nhave spun him to the uttermost parts of the earth in the whirlwind of\r\nhis wrath. Mind, I am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or\r\nhis legs, for it did not, in even the slightest degree. He was a\r\ncapacious container, but he did not hold enough for that. He took a\r\nlevel tumblerful of whisky every morning before he put his clothes\r\non\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto sweeten his bilgewater,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xe2\x80\x94He took another after he got\r\nthe most of his clothes on, \xe2\x80\x9cto settle his mind and give him his\r\nbearings.\xe2\x80\x9d He then shaved, and put on a clean shirt; after which he\r\nrecited the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer in a fervent, thundering bass that shook the\r\nship to her kelson and suspended all conversation in the main cabin.\r\nThen, at this stage, being invariably \xe2\x80\x9cby the head,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cby the stern,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nor \xe2\x80\x9clisted to port or starboard,\xe2\x80\x9d he took one more to \xe2\x80\x9cput him on an\r\neven keel so that he would mind his hellum and not miss stays and go\r\nabout, every time he came up in the wind.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94And now, his state-room door\r\nswung open and the sun of his benignant face beamed redly out upon men\r\nand women and children, and he roared his \xe2\x80\x9cShipmets a\xe2\x80\x99hoy!\xe2\x80\x9d in a way\r\nthat was calculated to wake the dead and precipitate the final\r\nresurrection; and forth he strode, a picture to look at and a presence\r\nto enforce attention. Stalwart and portly; not a gray hair; broadbrimmed\r\nslouch hat; semi-sailor toggery of blue navy flannel\xe2\x80\x94roomy and ample; a\r\nstately expanse of shirt-front and a liberal amount of black silk neck-\r\ncloth tied with a sailor knot; large chain and imposing seals impending\r\nfrom his fob; awe-inspiring feet, and \xe2\x80\x9ca hand like the hand of\r\nProvidence,\xe2\x80\x9d as his whaling brethren expressed it; wrist-bands and\r\nsleeves pushed back half way to the elbow, out of respect for the warm\r\nweather, and exposing hairy arms, gaudy with red and blue anchors,\r\nships, and goddesses of liberty tattooed in India ink. But these details\r\nwere only secondary matters\xe2\x80\x94his face was the lodestone that chained the\r\neye. It was a sultry disk, glowing determinedly out through a weather\r\nbeaten mask of mahogany, and studded with warts, seamed with scars,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cblazed\xe2\x80\x9d all over with unfailing fresh slips of the razor; and with\r\ncheery eyes, under shaggy brows, contemplating the world from over the\r\nback of a gnarled crag of a nose that loomed vast and lonely out of the\r\nundulating immensity that spread away from its foundations. At his heels\r\nfrisked the darling of his bachelor estate, his terrier \xe2\x80\x9cFan,\xe2\x80\x9d a\r\ncreature no larger than a squirrel. The main part of his daily life was\r\noccupied in looking after \xe2\x80\x9cFan,\xe2\x80\x9d in a motherly way, and doctoring her\r\nfor a hundred ailments which existed only in his imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n448.jpg (48K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Admiral seldom read newspapers; and when he did he never believed\r\nanything they said. He read nothing, and believed in nothing, but \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nOld Guard,\xe2\x80\x9d a secession periodical published in New York. He carried a\r\ndozen copies of it with him, always, and referred to them for all\r\nrequired information. If it was not there, he supplied it himself, out\r\nof a bountiful fancy, inventing history, names, dates, and every thing\r\nelse necessary to make his point good in an argument. Consequently he\r\nwas a formidable antagonist in a dispute. Whenever he swung clear of the\r\nrecord and began to create history, the enemy was helpless and had to\r\nsurrender. Indeed, the enemy could not keep from betraying some little\r\nspark of indignation at his manufactured history\xe2\x80\x94and when it came to\r\nindignation, that was the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s very \xe2\x80\x9cbest hold.\xe2\x80\x9d He was always\r\nready for a political argument, and if nobody started one he would do it\r\nhimself. With his third retort his temper would begin to rise, and\r\nwithin five minutes he would be blowing a gale, and within fifteen his\r\nsmoking-room audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left\r\nsolitary and alone, banging the table with his fist, kicking the chairs,\r\nand roaring a hurricane of profanity. It got so, after a while, that\r\nwhenever the Admiral approached, with politics in his eye, the\r\npassengers would drop out with quiet accord, afraid to meet him; and he\r\nwould camp on a deserted field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n449.jpg (34K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut he found his match at last, and before a full company. At one time\r\nor another, everybody had entered the lists against him and been routed,\r\nexcept the quiet passenger Williams. He had never been able to get an\r\nexpression of opinion out of him on politics. But now, just as the\r\nAdmiral drew near the door and the company were about to slip out,\r\nWilliams said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdmiral, are you _certain_ about that circumstance concerning the\r\nclergymen you mentioned the other day?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94referring to a piece of the\r\nAdmiral\xe2\x80\x99s manufactured history.\r\n\r\nEvery one was amazed at the man\xe2\x80\x99s rashness. The idea of deliberately\r\ninviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible. The retreat came to\r\na halt; then everybody sat down again wondering, to await the upshot of\r\nit. The Admiral himself was as surprised as any one. He paused in the\r\ndoor, with his red handkerchief half raised to his sweating face, and\r\ncontemplated the daring reptile in the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Certain_ of it? Am I _certain_ of it? Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been lying\r\nabout it? What do you take me for? Anybody that don\xe2\x80\x99t know that\r\ncircumstance, don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything; a child ought to know it. Read up\r\nyour history! Read it up\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94, and don\xe2\x80\x99t come asking a man if he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n_certain_ about a bit of ABC stuff that the very southern niggers know\r\nall about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHere the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s fires began to wax hot, the atmosphere thickened, the\r\ncoming earthquake rumbled, he began to thunder and lighten. Within three\r\nminutes his volcano was in full irruption and he was discharging flames\r\nand ashes of indignation, belching black volumes of foul history aloft,\r\nand vomiting red-hot torrents of profanity from his crater. Meantime\r\nWilliams sat silent, and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in\r\nwhat the old man was saying. By and by, when the lull came, he said in\r\nthe most deferential way, and with the gratified air of a man who has\r\nhad a mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him uncomfortably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ I understand it. I always thought I knew that piece of history\r\nwell enough, but was still afraid to trust it, because there was not\r\nthat convincing particularity about it that one likes to have in\r\nhistory; but when you mentioned every name, the other day, and every\r\ndate, and every little circumstance, in their just order and sequence, I\r\nsaid to myself, _this_ sounds something like\xe2\x80\x94_this_ is history\xe2\x80\x94_this_ is\r\nputting it in a shape that gives a man confidence; and I said to myself\r\nafterward, I will just ask the Admiral if he is perfectly certain about\r\nthe details, and if he is I will come out and thank him for clearing\r\nthis matter up for me. And that is what I want to do now\xe2\x80\x94for until you\r\nset that matter right it was nothing but just a confusion in my mind,\r\nwithout head or tail to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNobody ever saw the Admiral look so mollified before, and so pleased.\r\nNobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel before; its\r\ngenuineness had always been called in question either by words or looks;\r\nbut here was a man that not only swallowed it all down, but was grateful\r\nfor the dose. He was taken a back; he hardly knew what to say; even his\r\nprofanity failed him. Now, Williams continued, modestly and earnestly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Admiral, in saying that this was the first stone thrown, and that\r\nthis precipitated the war, you have overlooked a circumstance which you\r\nare perfectly familiar with, but which has escaped your memory. Now I\r\ngrant you that what you have stated is correct in every detail\xe2\x80\x94to wit:\r\nthat on the 16th of October, 1860, two Massachusetts clergymen, named\r\nWaite and Granger, went in disguise to the house of John Moody, in\r\nRockport, at dead of night, and dragged forth two southern women and\r\ntheir two little children, and after tarring and feathering them\r\nconveyed them to Boston and burned them alive in the State House square;\r\nand I also grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the\r\nsecession of South Carolina on the 20th of December following. Very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d [Here the company were pleasantly surprised to hear Williams\r\nproceed to come back at the Admiral with his own invincible\r\nweapon\xe2\x80\x94clean, pure, _manufactured history_, without a word of truth in\r\nit.] \xe2\x80\x9cVery well, I say. But Admiral, why overlook the Willis and Morgan\r\ncase in South Carolina? You are too well informed a man not to know all\r\nabout that circumstance. Your arguments and your conversations have\r\nshown you to be intimately conversant with every detail of this national\r\nquarrel. You develop matters of history every day that show plainly that\r\nyou are no smatterer in it, content to nibble about the surface, but a\r\nman who has searched the depths and possessed yourself of everything\r\nthat has a bearing upon the great question. Therefore, let me just\r\nrecall to your mind that Willis and Morgan case\xe2\x80\x94though I see by your\r\nface that the whole thing is already passing through your memory at this\r\nmoment. On the 12th of August, 1860, _two months_ before the Waite and\r\nGranger affair, two South Carolina clergymen, named John H. Morgan and\r\nWinthrop L. Willis, one a Methodist and the other an Old School Baptist,\r\ndisguised themselves, and went at midnight to the house of a planter\r\nnamed Thompson\xe2\x80\x94Archibald F. Thompson, Vice President under Thomas\r\nJefferson,\xe2\x80\x94and took thence, at midnight, his widowed aunt, (a Northern\r\nwoman,) and her adopted child, an orphan named Mortimer Highie,\r\nafflicted with epilepsy and suffering at the time from white swelling on\r\none of his legs, and compelled to walk on crutches in consequence; and\r\nthe two ministers, in spite of the pleadings of the victims, dragged\r\nthem to the bush, tarred and feathered them, and afterward burned them\r\nat the stake in the city of Charleston. You remember perfectly well what\r\na stir it made; you remember perfectly well that even the Charleston\r\n_Courier_ stigmatized the act as being unpleasant, of questionable\r\npropriety, and scarcely justifiable, and likewise that it would not be\r\nmatter of surprise if retaliation ensued. And you remember also, that\r\nthis thing was the _cause_ of the Massachusetts outrage. Who, indeed,\r\nwere the two Massachusetts ministers? and who were the two Southern\r\nwomen they burned? I do not need to remind _you_, Admiral, with your\r\nintimate knowledge of history, that Waite was the nephew of the woman\r\nburned in Charleston; that Granger was her cousin in the second degree,\r\nand that the woman they burned in Boston was the wife of John H. Morgan,\r\nand the still loved but divorced wife of Winthrop L. Willis. Now,\r\nAdmiral, it is only fair that you should acknowledge that the first\r\nprovocation came from the Southern preachers and that the Northern ones\r\nwere justified in retaliating. In your arguments you never yet have\r\nshown the least disposition to withhold a just verdict or be in anywise\r\nunfair, when authoritative history condemned your position, and\r\ntherefore I have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame\r\nfrom the Massachusetts ministers, in this matter, and transfer it to the\r\nSouth Carolina clergymen where it justly belongs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n453.jpg (44K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Admiral was conquered. This sweet spoken creature who swallowed his\r\nfraudulent history as if it were the bread of life; basked in his\r\nfurious blasphemy as if it were generous sunshine; found only calm,\r\neven-handed justice in his rampart partisanship; and flooded him with\r\ninvented history so sugarcoated with flattery and deference that there\r\nwas no rejecting it, was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo many\xe2\x80\x9d for him. He stammered some awkward,\r\nprofane sentences about the\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94Willis and Morgan business having\r\nescaped his memory, but that he \xe2\x80\x9cremembered it now,\xe2\x80\x9d and then, under\r\npretence of giving Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough, drew out of\r\nthe battle and went away, a vanquished man. Then cheers and laughter\r\nwent up, and Williams, the ship\xe2\x80\x99s benefactor was a hero. The news went\r\nabout the vessel, champagne was ordered, and enthusiastic reception\r\ninstituted in the smoking room, and everybody flocked thither to shake\r\nhands with the conqueror. The wheelman said afterward, that the Admiral\r\nstood up behind the pilot house and \xe2\x80\x9cripped and cursed all to himself\xe2\x80\x9d\r\ntill he loosened the smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s power was broken. After that, if he began argument,\r\nsomebody would bring Williams, and the old man would grow weak and begin\r\nto quiet down at once. And as soon as he was done, Williams in his\r\ndulcet, insinuating way, would invent some history (referring for proof,\r\nto the old man\xe2\x80\x99s own excellent memory and to copies of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Old Guard\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nknown not to be in his possession) that would turn the tables completely\r\nand leave the Admiral all abroad and helpless. By and by he came to so\r\ndread Williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he\r\nsaw him approach, and finally ceased to mention politics altogether, and\r\nfrom that time forward there was entire peace and serenity in the ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a certain bright morning the Islands hove in sight, lying low on the\r\nlonely sea, and everybody climbed to the upper deck to look. After two\r\nthousand miles of watery solitude the vision was a welcome one. As we\r\napproached, the imposing promontory of Diamond Head rose up out of the\r\nocean its rugged front softened by the hazy distance, and presently the\r\ndetails of the land began to make themselves manifest: first the line of\r\nbeach; then the plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics; then cabins of\r\nthe natives; then the white town of Honolulu, said to contain between\r\ntwelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level; with\r\nstreets from twenty to thirty feet wide, solid and level as a floor,\r\nmost of them straight as a line and few as crooked as a corkscrew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n455.jpg (98K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe further I traveled through the town the better I liked it. Every\r\nstep revealed a new contrast\xe2\x80\x94disclosed something I was unaccustomed to.\r\nIn place of the grand mud-colored brown fronts of San Francisco, I saw\r\ndwellings built of straw, adobies, and cream-colored pebble-and-shell-\r\nconglomerated coral, cut into oblong blocks and laid in cement; also a\r\ngreat number of neat white cottages, with green window-shutters; in\r\nplace of front yards like billiard-tables with iron fences around them,\r\nI saw these homes surrounded by ample yards, thickly clad with green\r\ngrass, and shaded by tall trees, through whose dense foliage the sun\r\ncould scarcely penetrate; in place of the customary geranium, calla\r\nlily, etc., languishing in dust and general debility, I saw luxurious\r\nbanks and thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after a rain, and\r\nglowing with the richest dyes; in place of the dingy horrors of San\r\nFrancisco\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure grove, the \xe2\x80\x9cWillows,\xe2\x80\x9d I saw huge-bodied, wide-\r\nspreading forest trees, with strange names and stranger appearance\xe2\x80\x94trees\r\nthat cast a shadow like a thunder-cloud, and were able to stand alone\r\nwithout being tied to green poles; in place of gold fish, wiggling\r\naround in glass globes, assuming countless shades and degrees of\r\ndistortion through the magnifying and diminishing qualities of their\r\ntransparent prison houses, I saw cats\xe2\x80\x94Tom-cats, Mary Ann cats, long-\r\ntailed cats, bob-tailed cats, blind cats, one-eyed cats, wall-eyed cats,\r\ncross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats, white cats, yellow cats, striped\r\ncats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild cats, singed cats, individual cats,\r\ngroups of cats, platoons of cats, companies of cats, regiments of cats,\r\narmies of cats, multitudes of cats, millions of cats, and all of them\r\nsleek, fat, lazy and sound asleep. I looked on a multitude of people,\r\nsome white, in white coats, vests, pantaloons, even white cloth shoes,\r\nmade snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning; but the majority of\r\nthe people were almost as dark as negroes\xe2\x80\x94women with comely features,\r\nfine black eyes, rounded forms, inclining to the voluptuous, clad in a\r\nsingle bright red or white garment that fell free and unconfined from\r\nshoulder to heel, long black hair falling loose, gypsy hats, encircled\r\nwith wreaths of natural flowers of a brilliant carmine tint; plenty of\r\ndark men in various costumes, and some with nothing on but a battered\r\nstove-pipe hat tilted on the nose, and a very scant breech-\r\nclout;\xe2\x80\x94certain smoke-dried children were clothed in nothing but\r\nsunshine\xe2\x80\x94a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n456.jpg (25K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on the corners,\r\nI saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island maidens sitting on the\r\nground in the shade of corner houses, gazing indolently at whatever or\r\nwhoever happened along; instead of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I\r\nwalked on a firm foundation of coral, built up from the bottom of the\r\nsea by the absurd but persevering insect of that name, with a light\r\nlayer of lava and cinders overlying the coral, belched up out of\r\nfathomless perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater\r\nthat stands dead and harmless in the distance now; instead of cramped\r\nand crowded street-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by, free as\r\nthe wind, on fleet horses and astride, with gaudy riding-sashes,\r\nstreaming like banners behind them; instead of the combined stenches of\r\nChinadom and Brannan street slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy\r\nfragrance of jessamine, oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of\r\nthe hurry and bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco, I moved in\r\nthe midst of a Summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in\r\nplace of the Golden City\xe2\x80\x99s skirting sand hills and the placid bay, I saw\r\non the one side a frame-work of tall, precipitous mountains close at\r\nhand, clad in refreshing green, and cleft by deep, cool, chasm-like\r\nvalleys\xe2\x80\x94and in front the grand sweep of the ocean: a brilliant,\r\ntransparent green near the shore, bound and bordered by a long white\r\nline of foamy spray dashing against the reef, and further out the dead\r\nblue water of the deep sea, flecked with \xe2\x80\x9cwhite caps,\xe2\x80\x9d and in the far\r\nhorizon a single, lonely sail\xe2\x80\x94a mere accent-mark to emphasize a\r\nslumberous calm and a solitude that were without sound or limit. When\r\nthe sun sunk down\xe2\x80\x94the one intruder from other realms and persistent in\r\nsuggestions of them\xe2\x80\x94it was tranced luxury to sit in the perfumed air and\r\nforget that there was any world but these enchanted islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n457.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was such ecstacy to dream, and dream\xe2\x80\x94till you got a bite. A scorpion\r\nbite. Then the first duty was to get up out of the grass and kill the\r\nscorpion; and the next to bathe the bitten place with alcohol or brandy;\r\nand the next to resolve to keep out of the grass in future. Then came an\r\nadjournment to the bed-chamber and the pastime of writing up the day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njournal with one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the other\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nwhole community of them at a slap. Then, observing an enemy\r\napproaching,\xe2\x80\x94a hairy tarantula on stilts\xe2\x80\x94why not set the spittoon on\r\nhim? It is done, and the projecting ends of his paws give a luminous\r\nidea of the magnitude of his reach. Then to bed and become a promenade\r\nfor a centipede with forty-two legs on a side and every foot hot enough\r\nto burn a hole through a raw-hide. More soaking with alcohol, and a\r\nresolution to examine the bed before entering it, in future. Then wait,\r\nand suffer, till all the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in\r\nunder the bar, then slip out quickly, shut them in and sleep peacefully\r\non the floor till morning. Meantime it is comforting to curse the\r\ntropics in occasional wakeful intervals.\r\n\r\nWe had an abundance of fruit in Honolulu, of course. Oranges, pine-\r\napples, bananas, strawberries, lemons, limes, mangoes, guavas, melons,\r\nand a rare and curious luxury called the chirimoya, which is\r\ndeliciousness itself. Then there is the tamarind. I thought tamarinds\r\nwere made to eat, but that was probably not the idea. I ate several, and\r\nit seemed to me that they were rather sour that year. They pursed up my\r\nlips, till they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my\r\nsustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThey sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them, and gave\r\nthem a \xe2\x80\x9cwire edge\xe2\x80\x9d that I was afraid would stay; but a citizen said \xe2\x80\x9cno,\r\nit will come off when the enamel does\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which was comforting, at any\r\nrate. I found, afterward, that only strangers eat tamarinds\xe2\x80\x94but they\r\nonly eat them once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n458.jpg (145K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my diary of our third day in Honolulu, I find this:\r\n\r\nI am probably the most sensitive man in Hawaii to-night\xe2\x80\x94especially about\r\nsitting down in the presence of my betters. I have ridden fifteen or\r\ntwenty miles on horse-back since 5 P.M. and to tell the honest truth, I\r\nhave a delicacy about sitting down at all.\r\n\r\nAn excursion to Diamond Head and the King\xe2\x80\x99s Coacoanut Grove was planned\r\nto-day\xe2\x80\x94time, 4:30 P.M.\xe2\x80\x94the party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen\r\nand three ladies. They all started at the appointed hour except myself.\r\nI was at the Government prison, (with Captain Fish and another\r\nwhaleship-skipper, Captain Phillips,) and got so interested in its\r\nexamination that I did not notice how quickly the time was passing.\r\nSomebody remarked that it was twenty minutes past five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and that\r\nwoke me up. It was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Phillips was\r\nalong with his \xe2\x80\x9cturn out,\xe2\x80\x9d as he calls a top-buggy that Captain Cook\r\nbrought here in 1778, and a horse that was here when Captain Cook came.\r\nCaptain Phillips takes a just pride in his driving and in the speed of\r\nhis horse, and to his passion for displaying them I owe it that we were\r\nonly sixteen minutes coming from the prison to the American Hotel\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndistance which has been estimated to be over half a mile. But it took\r\nsome fearful driving. The Captain\xe2\x80\x99s whip came down fast, and the blows\r\nstarted so much dust out of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hide that during the last half\r\nof the journey we rode through an impenetrable fog, and ran by a pocket\r\ncompass in the hands of Captain Fish, a whaler of twenty-six years\r\nexperience, who sat there through the perilous voyage as self-possessed\r\nas if he had been on the euchre-deck of his own ship, and calmly said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPort your helm\xe2\x80\x94port,\xe2\x80\x9d from time to time, and \xe2\x80\x9cHold her a little\r\nfree\xe2\x80\x94steady\xe2\x80\x94so\xe2\x80\x94so,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLuff\xe2\x80\x94hard down to starboard!\xe2\x80\x9d and never once\r\nlost his presence of mind or betrayed the least anxiety by voice or\r\nmanner. When we came to anchor at last, and Captain Phillips looked at\r\nhis watch and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSixteen minutes\xe2\x80\x94I told you it was in her! that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nover three miles an hour!\xe2\x80\x9d I could see he felt entitled to a compliment,\r\nand so I said I had never seen lightning go like that horse. And I never\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of the American said the party had been gone nearly an\r\nhour, but that he could give me my choice of several horses that could\r\novertake them. I said, never mind\xe2\x80\x94I preferred a safe horse to a fast\r\none\xe2\x80\x94I would like to have an excessively gentle horse\xe2\x80\x94a horse with no\r\nspirit whatever\xe2\x80\x94a lame one, if he had such a thing. Inside of five\r\nminutes I was mounted, and perfectly satisfied with my outfit. I had no\r\ntime to label him \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a horse,\xe2\x80\x9d and so if the public took him for a\r\nsheep I cannot help it. I was satisfied, and that was the main thing. I\r\ncould see that he had as many fine points as any man\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and so I\r\nhung my hat on one of them, behind the saddle, and swabbed the\r\nperspiration from my face and started. I named him after this island,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOahu\xe2\x80\x9d (pronounced O-waw-hee). The first gate he came to he started in;\r\nI had neither whip nor spur, and so I simply argued the case with him.\r\nHe resisted argument, but ultimately yielded to insult and abuse. He\r\nbacked out of that gate and steered for another one on the other side of\r\nthe street. I triumphed by my former process. Within the next six\r\nhundred yards he crossed the street fourteen times and attempted\r\nthirteen gates, and in the meantime the tropical sun was beating down\r\nand threatening to cave the top of my head in, and I was literally\r\ndripping with perspiration. He abandoned the gate business after that\r\nand went along peaceably enough, but absorbed in meditation. I noticed\r\nthis latter circumstance, and it soon began to fill me with\r\napprehension. I said to my self, this creature is planning some new\r\noutrage, some fresh deviltry or other\xe2\x80\x94no horse ever thought over a\r\nsubject so profoundly as this one is doing just for nothing. The more\r\nthis thing preyed upon my mind the more uneasy I became, until the\r\nsuspense became almost unbearable and I dismounted to see if there was\r\nanything wild in his eye\xe2\x80\x94for I had heard that the eye of this noblest of\r\nour domestic animals is very expressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n461.jpg (86K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot describe what a load of anxiety was lifted from my mind when I\r\nfound that he was only asleep. I woke him up and started him into a\r\nfaster walk, and then the villainy of his nature came out again. He\r\ntried to climb over a stone wall, five or six feet high. I saw that I\r\nmust apply force to this horse, and that I might as well begin first as\r\nlast. I plucked a stout switch from a tamarind tree, and the moment he\r\nsaw it, he surrendered. He broke into a convulsive sort of a canter,\r\nwhich had three short steps in it and one long one, and reminded me\r\nalternately of the clattering shake of the great earthquake, and the\r\nsweeping plunging of the _Ajax_ in a storm.\r\n\r\nAnd now there can be no fitter occasion than the present to pronounce a\r\nleft-handed blessing upon the man who invented the American saddle.\r\nThere is no seat to speak of about it\xe2\x80\x94one might as well sit in a\r\nshovel\xe2\x80\x94and the stirrups are nothing but an ornamental nuisance. If I\r\nwere to write down here all the abuse I expended on those stirrups, it\r\nwould make a large book, even without pictures. Sometimes I got one\r\nfoot so far through, that the stirrup partook of the nature of an\r\nanklet; sometimes both feet were through, and I was handcuffed by the\r\nlegs; and sometimes my feet got clear out and left the stirrups wildly\r\ndangling about my shins. Even when I was in proper position and\r\ncarefully balanced upon the balls of my feet, there was no comfort in\r\nit, on account of my nervous dread that they were going to slip one way\r\nor the other in a moment. But the subject is too exasperating to write\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nA mile and a half from town, I came to a grove of tall cocoanut trees,\r\nwith clean, branchless stems reaching straight up sixty or seventy feet\r\nand topped with a spray of green foliage sheltering clusters of cocoa-\r\nnuts\xe2\x80\x94not more picturesque than a forest of collossal ragged parasols,\r\nwith bunches of magnified grapes under them, would be.\r\n\r\nI once heard a gouty northern invalid say that a cocoanut tree might be\r\npoetical, possibly it was; but it looked like a feather-duster struck by\r\nlightning. I think that describes it better than a picture\xe2\x80\x94and yet,\r\nwithout any question, there is something fascinating about a cocoa-nut\r\ntree\xe2\x80\x94and graceful, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n462.jpg (29K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen cottages, some frame and the others of native grass,\r\nnestled sleepily in the shade here and there. The grass cabins are of a\r\ngrayish color, are shaped much like our own cottages, only with higher\r\nand steeper roofs usually, and are made of some kind of weed strongly\r\nbound together in bundles. The roofs are very thick, and so are the\r\nwalls; the latter have square holes in them for windows. At a little\r\ndistance these cabins have a furry appearance, as if they might be made\r\nof bear skins. They are very cool and pleasant inside. The King\xe2\x80\x99s flag\r\nwas flying from the roof of one of the cottages, and His Majesty was\r\nprobably within. He owns the whole concern thereabouts, and passes his\r\ntime there frequently, on sultry days \xe2\x80\x9claying off.\xe2\x80\x9d The spot is called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe King\xe2\x80\x99s Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNear by is an interesting ruin\xe2\x80\x94the meagre remains of an ancient heathen\r\ntemple\xe2\x80\x94a place where human sacrifices were offered up in those old\r\nbygone days when the simple child of nature, yielding momentarily to sin\r\nwhen sorely tempted, acknowledged his error when calm reflection had\r\nshown it him, and came forward with noble frankness and offered up his\r\ngrandmother as an atoning sacrifice\xe2\x80\x94in those old days when the luckless\r\nsinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving periodical\r\nhappiness as long as his relations held out; long, long before the\r\nmissionaries braved a thousand privations to come and make them\r\npermanently miserable by telling them how beautiful and how blissful a\r\nplace heaven is, and how nearly impossible it is to get there; and\r\nshowed the poor native how dreary a place perdition is and what\r\nunnecessarily liberal facilities there are for going to it; showed him\r\nhow, in his ignorance he had gone and fooled away all his kinfolks to no\r\npurpose; showed him what rapture it is to work all day long for fifty\r\ncents to buy food for next day with, as compared with fishing for\r\npastime and lolling in the shade through eternal Summer, and eating of\r\nthe bounty that nobody labored to provide but Nature. How sad it is to\r\nthink of the multitudes who have gone to their graves in this beautiful\r\nisland and never knew there was a hell!\r\n\r\nThis ancient temple was built of rough blocks of lava, and was simply a\r\nroofless inclosure a hundred and thirty feet long and seventy\r\nwide\xe2\x80\x94nothing but naked walls, very thick, but not much higher than a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s head. They will last for ages no doubt, if left unmolested. Its\r\nthree altars and other sacred appurtenances have crumbled and passed\r\naway years ago. It is said that in the old times thousands of human\r\nbeings were slaughtered here, in the presence of naked and howling\r\nsavages. If these mute stones could speak, what tales they could tell,\r\nwhat pictures they could describe, of fettered victims writhing under\r\nthe knife; of massed forms straining forward out of the gloom, with\r\nferocious faces lit up by the sacrificial fires; of the background of\r\nghostly trees; of the dark pyramid of Diamond Head standing sentinel\r\nover the uncanny scene, and the peaceful moon looking down upon it\r\nthrough rifts in the cloud-rack!\r\n\r\nWhen Kamehameha (pronounced Ka-may-ha-may-ah) the Great\xe2\x80\x94who was a sort\r\nof a Napoleon in military genius and uniform success\xe2\x80\x94invaded this island\r\nof Oahu three quarters of a century ago, and exterminated the army sent\r\nto oppose him, and took full and final possession of the country, he\r\nsearched out the dead body of the King of Oahu, and those of the\r\nprincipal chiefs, and impaled their heads on the walls of this temple.\r\n\r\nThose were savage times when this old slaughter-house was in its prime.\r\nThe King and the chiefs ruled the common herd with a rod of iron; made\r\nthem gather all the provisions the masters needed; build all the houses\r\nand temples; stand all the expenses, of whatever kind; take kicks and\r\ncuffs for thanks; drag out lives well flavored with misery, and then\r\nsuffer death for trifling offences or yield up their lives on the\r\nsacrificial altars to purchase favors from the gods for their hard\r\nrulers. The missionaries have clothed them, educated them, broken up the\r\ntyrannous authority of their chiefs, and given them freedom and the\r\nright to enjoy whatever their hands and brains produce with equal laws\r\nfor all, and punishment for all alike who transgress them. The contrast\r\nis so strong\xe2\x80\x94the benefit conferred upon this people by the missionaries\r\nis so prominent, so palpable and so unquestionable, that the frankest\r\ncompliment I can pay them, and the best, is simply to point to the\r\ncondition of the Sandwich Islanders of Captain Cook\xe2\x80\x99s time, and their\r\ncondition to-day.\r\n\r\nTheir work speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by, after a rugged climb, we halted on the summit of a hill which\r\ncommanded a far-reaching view. The moon rose and flooded mountain and\r\nvalley and ocean with a mellow radiance, and out of the shadows of the\r\nfoliage the distant lights of Honolulu glinted like an encampment of\r\nfireflies. The air was heavy with the fragrance of flowers. The halt was\r\nbrief.\xe2\x80\x94Gayly laughing and talking, the party galloped on, and I clung to\r\nthe pommel and cantered after. Presently we came to a place where no\r\ngrass grew\xe2\x80\x94a wide expanse of deep sand. They said it was an old battle\r\nground. All around everywhere, not three feet apart, the bleached bones\r\nof men gleamed white in the moonlight. We picked up a lot of them for\r\nmementoes. I got quite a number of arm bones and leg bones\xe2\x80\x94of great\r\nchiefs, may be, who had fought savagely in that fearful battle in the\r\nold days, when blood flowed like wine where we now stood\xe2\x80\x94and wore the\r\nchoicest of them out on Oahu afterward, trying to make him go. All sorts\r\nof bones could be found except skulls; but a citizen said, irreverently,\r\nthat there had been an unusual number of \xe2\x80\x9cskull-hunters\xe2\x80\x9d there lately\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nspecies of sportsmen I had never heard of before.\r\n\r\nNothing whatever is known about this place\xe2\x80\x94its story is a secret that\r\nwill never be revealed. The oldest natives make no pretense of being\r\npossessed of its history. They say these bones were here when they were\r\nchildren. They were here when their grandfathers were children\xe2\x80\x94but how\r\nthey came here, they can only conjecture. Many people believe this spot\r\nto be an ancient battle-ground, and it is usual to call it so; and they\r\nbelieve that these skeletons have lain for ages just where their\r\nproprietors fell in the great fight. Other people believe that\r\nKamehameha I. fought his first battle here. On this point, I have heard\r\na story, which may have been taken from one of the numerous books which\r\nhave been written concerning these islands\xe2\x80\x94I do not know where the\r\nnarrator got it. He said that when Kamehameha (who was at first merely a\r\nsubordinate chief on the island of Hawaii), landed here, he brought a\r\nlarge army with him, and encamped at Waikiki. The Oahuans marched\r\nagainst him, and so confident were they of success that they readily\r\nacceded to a demand of their priests that they should draw a line where\r\nthese bones now lie, and take an oath that, if forced to retreat at all,\r\nthey would never retreat beyond this boundary. The priests told them\r\nthat death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who violated\r\nthe oath, and the march was resumed. Kamehameha drove them back step by\r\nstep; the priests fought in the front rank and exhorted them both by\r\nvoice and inspiriting example to remember their oath\xe2\x80\x94to die, if need be,\r\nbut never cross the fatal line. The struggle was manfully maintained,\r\nbut at last the chief priest fell, pierced to the heart with a spear,\r\nand the unlucky omen fell like a blight upon the brave souls at his\r\nback; with a triumphant shout the invaders pressed forward\xe2\x80\x94the line was\r\ncrossed\xe2\x80\x94the offended gods deserted the despairing army, and, accepting\r\nthe doom their perjury had brought upon them, they broke and fled over\r\nthe plain where Honolulu stands now\xe2\x80\x94up the beautiful Nuuanu\r\nValley\xe2\x80\x94paused a moment, hemmed in by precipitous mountains on either\r\nhand and the frightful precipice of the Pari in front, and then were\r\ndriven over\xe2\x80\x94a sheer plunge of six hundred feet!\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty enough, but Mr. Jarves\xe2\x80\x99 excellent history says the\r\nOahuans were intrenched in Nuuanu Valley; that Kamehameha ousted them,\r\nrouted them, pursued them up the valley and drove them over the\r\nprecipice. He makes no mention of our bone-yard at all in his book.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the profound silence and repose that rested over the\r\nbeautiful landscape, and being, as usual, in the rear, I gave voice to\r\nmy thoughts. I said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a picture is here slumbering in the solemn glory of the moon! How\r\nstrong the rugged outlines of the dead volcano stand out against the\r\nclear sky! What a snowy fringe marks the bursting of the surf over the\r\nlong, curved reef! How calmly the dim city sleeps yonder in the plain!\r\nHow soft the shadows lie upon the stately mountains that border the\r\ndream-haunted Mauoa Valley! What a grand pyramid of billowy clouds\r\ntowers above the storied Pari! How the grim warriors of the past seem\r\nflocking in ghostly squadrons to their ancient battlefield again\xe2\x80\x94how the\r\nwails of the dying well up from the\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this point the horse called Oahu sat down in the sand. Sat down to\r\nlisten, I suppose. Never mind what he heard, I stopped apostrophising\r\nand convinced him that I was not a man to allow contempt of Court on the\r\npart of a horse. I broke the back-bone of a Chief over his rump and set\r\nout to join the cavalcade again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n467.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery considerably fagged out we arrived in town at 9 o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night,\r\nmyself in the lead\xe2\x80\x94for when my horse finally came to understand that he\r\nwas homeward bound and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t far to go, he turned his attention\r\nstrictly to business.\r\n\r\nThis is a good time to drop in a paragraph of information. There is no\r\nregular livery stable in Honolulu, or, indeed, in any part of the\r\nKingdom of Hawaii; therefore unless you are acquainted with wealthy\r\nresidents (who all have good horses), you must hire animals of the\r\nwretchedest description from the Kanakas. (i.e. natives.) Any horse you\r\nhire, even though it be from a white man, is not often of much account,\r\nbecause it will be brought in for you from some ranch, and has\r\nnecessarily been leading a hard life. If the Kanakas who have been\r\ncaring for him (inveterate riders they are) have not ridden him half to\r\ndeath every day themselves, you can depend upon it they have been doing\r\nthe same thing by proxy, by clandestinely hiring him out. At least, so I\r\nam informed. The result is, that no horse has a chance to eat, drink,\r\nrest, recuperate, or look well or feel well, and so strangers go about\r\nthe Islands mounted as I was to-day.\r\n\r\nIn hiring a horse from a Kanaka, you must have all your eyes about you,\r\nbecause you can rest satisfied that you are dealing with a shrewd\r\nunprincipled rascal. You may leave your door open and your trunk\r\nunlocked as long as you please, and he will not meddle with your\r\nproperty; he has no important vices and no inclination to commit robbery\r\non a large scale; but if he can get ahead of you in the horse business,\r\nhe will take a genuine delight in doing it. This traits is\r\ncharacteristic of horse jockeys, the world over, is it not? He will\r\novercharge you if he can; he will hire you a fine-looking horse at night\r\n(anybody\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94may be the King\xe2\x80\x99s, if the royal steed be in convenient view),\r\nand bring you the mate to my Oahu in the morning, and contend that it is\r\nthe same animal. If you make trouble, he will get out by saying it was\r\nnot himself who made the bargain with you, but his brother, \xe2\x80\x9cwho went\r\nout in the country this morning.\xe2\x80\x9d They have always got a \xe2\x80\x9cbrother\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nshift the responsibility upon. A victim said to one of these fellows one\r\nday:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I know I hired the horse of you, because I noticed that scar on\r\nyour cheek.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe reply was not bad: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes\xe2\x80\x94yes\xe2\x80\x94my brother all same\xe2\x80\x94we twins!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n469.jpg (81K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, J. Smith, hired a horse yesterday, the Kanaka\r\nwarranting him to be in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nSmith had a saddle and blanket of his own, and he ordered the Kanaka to\r\nput these on the horse. The Kanaka protested that he was perfectly\r\nwilling to trust the gentleman with the saddle that was already on the\r\nanimal, but Smith refused to use it. The change was made; then Smith\r\nnoticed that the Kanaka had only changed the saddles, and had left the\r\noriginal blanket on the horse; he said he forgot to change the blankets,\r\nand so, to cut the bother short, Smith mounted and rode away. The horse\r\nwent lame a mile from town, and afterward got to cutting up some\r\nextraordinary capers. Smith got down and took off the saddle, but the\r\nblanket stuck fast to the horse\xe2\x80\x94glued to a procession of raw places. The\r\nKanaka\xe2\x80\x99s mysterious conduct stood explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n470.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother friend of mine bought a pretty good horse from a native, a day\r\nor two ago, after a tolerably thorough examination of the animal. He\r\ndiscovered today that the horse was as blind as a bat, in one eye. He\r\nmeant to have examined that eye, and came home with a general notion\r\nthat he had done it; but he remembers now that every time he made the\r\nattempt his attention was called to something else by his victimizer.\r\n\r\nOne more instance, and then I will pass to something else. I am informed\r\nthat when a certain Mr. L., a visiting stranger, was here, he bought a\r\npair of very respectable-looking match horses from a native. They were\r\nin a little stable with a partition through the middle of it\xe2\x80\x94one horse\r\nin each apartment. Mr. L. examined one of them critically through a\r\nwindow (the Kanaka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbrother\xe2\x80\x9d having gone to the country with the key),\r\nand then went around the house and examined the other through a window\r\non the other side. He said it was the neatest match he had ever seen,\r\nand paid for the horses on the spot. Whereupon the Kanaka departed to\r\njoin his brother in the country. The fellow had shamefully swindled L.\r\nThere was only one \xe2\x80\x9cmatch\xe2\x80\x9d horse, and he had examined his starboard side\r\nthrough one window and his port side through another! I decline to\r\nbelieve this story, but I give it because it is worth something as a\r\nfanciful illustration of a fixed fact\xe2\x80\x94namely, that the Kanaka horse-\r\njockey is fertile in invention and elastic in conscience.\r\n\r\nYou can buy a pretty good horse for forty or fifty dollars, and a good\r\nenough horse for all practical purposes for two dollars and a half. I\r\nestimate \xe2\x80\x9cOahu\xe2\x80\x9d to be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five\r\ncents. A good deal better animal than he is was sold here day before\r\nyesterday for a dollar and seventy-five cents, and sold again to-day for\r\ntwo dollars and twenty-five cents; Williams bought a handsome and lively\r\nlittle pony yesterday for ten dollars; and about the best common horse\r\non the island (and he is a really good one) sold yesterday, with Mexican\r\nsaddle and bridle, for seventy dollars\xe2\x80\x94a horse which is well and widely\r\nknown, and greatly respected for his speed, good disposition and\r\neverlasting bottom.\r\n\r\nYou give your horse a little grain once a day; it comes from San\r\nFrancisco, and is worth about two cents a pound; and you give him as\r\nmuch hay as he wants; it is cut and brought to the market by natives,\r\nand is not very good it is baled into long, round bundles, about the\r\nsize of a large man; one of them is stuck by the middle on each end of a\r\nsix foot pole, and the Kanaka shoulders the pole and walks about the\r\nstreets between the upright bales in search of customers.

The native girls by\r\ntwos and threes and parties of a dozen, and sometimes in whole platoons\r\nand companies, went cantering up and down the neighboring streets\r\nastride of fleet but homely horses, and with their gaudy riding habits\r\nstreaming like banners behind them. Such a troop of free and easy\r\nriders, in their natural home, the saddle, makes a gay and graceful\r\nspectacle. The riding habit I speak of is simply a long, broad scarf,\r\nlike a tavern table cloth brilliantly colored, wrapped around the loins\r\nonce, then apparently passed between the limbs and each end thrown\r\nbackward over the same, and floating and flapping behind on both sides\r\nbeyond the horse\xe2\x80\x99s tail like a couple of fancy flags; then, slipping the\r\nstirrup-irons between her toes, the girl throws her chest forward, sits\r\nup like a Major General and goes sweeping by like the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n474.jpg (88K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girls put on all the finery they can on Saturday afternoon\xe2\x80\x94fine\r\nblack silk robes; flowing red ones that nearly put your eyes out; others\r\nas white as snow; still others that discount the rainbow; and they wear\r\ntheir hair in nets, and trim their jaunty hats with fresh flowers, and\r\nencircle their dusky throats with home-made necklaces of the brilliant\r\nvermillion-tinted blossom of the _ohia_; and they fill the markets and\r\nthe adjacent street with their bright presences, and smell like a rag\r\nfactory on fire with their offensive cocoanut oil.\r\n\r\nOccasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away down in the\r\nSouth Seas, with his face and neck tatooed till he looks like the\r\ncustomary mendicant from Washoe who has been blown up in a mine. Some\r\nare tattooed a dead blue color down to the upper lip\xe2\x80\x94masked, as it\r\nwere\xe2\x80\x94leaving the natural light yellow skin of Micronesia unstained from\r\nthence down; some with broad marks drawn down from hair to neck, on both\r\nsides of the face, and a strip of the original yellow skin, two inches\r\nwide, down the center\xe2\x80\x94a gridiron with a spoke broken out; and some with\r\nthe entire face discolored with the popular mortification tint, relieved\r\nonly by one or two thin, wavy threads of natural yellow running across\r\nthe face from ear to ear, and eyes twinkling out of this darkness, from\r\nunder shadowing hat-brims, like stars in the dark of the moon.\r\n\r\nMoving among the stirring crowds, you come to the poi merchants,\r\nsquatting in the shade on their hams, in true native fashion, and\r\nsurrounded by purchasers. (The Sandwich Islanders always squat on their\r\nhams, and who knows but they may be the old original \xe2\x80\x9cham sandwiches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe thought is pregnant with interest.) The poi looks like common flour\r\npaste, and is kept in large bowls formed of a species of gourd, and\r\ncapable of holding from one to three or four gallons. Poi is the chief\r\narticle of food among the natives, and is prepared from the _taro_\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n475.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _taro_ root looks like a thick, or, if you please, a corpulent sweet\r\npotato, in shape, but is of a light purple color when boiled. When\r\nboiled it answers as a passable substitute for bread. The buck Kanakas\r\nbake it under ground, then mash it up well with a heavy lava pestle, mix\r\nwater with it until it becomes a paste, set it aside and let if ferment,\r\nand then it is poi\xe2\x80\x94and an unseductive mixture it is, almost tasteless\r\nbefore it ferments and too sour for a luxury afterward. But nothing is\r\nmore nutritious. When solely used, however, it produces acrid humors, a\r\nfact which sufficiently accounts for the humorous character of the\r\nKanakas. I think there must be as much of a knack in handling poi as\r\nthere is in eating with chopsticks. The forefinger is thrust into the\r\nmess and stirred quickly round several times and drawn as quickly out,\r\nthickly coated, just as it it were poulticed; the head is thrown back,\r\nthe finger inserted in the mouth and the delicacy stripped off and\r\nswallowed\xe2\x80\x94the eye closing gently, meanwhile, in a languid sort of\r\necstasy. Many a different finger goes into the same bowl and many a\r\ndifferent kind of dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the\r\nvirtues of its contents.\r\n\r\nAround a small shanty was collected a crowd of natives buying the _awa_\r\nroot. It is said that but for the use of this root the destruction of\r\nthe people in former times by certain imported diseases would have been\r\nfar greater than it was, and by others it is said that this is merely a\r\nfancy. All agree that poi will rejuvenate a man who is used up and his\r\nvitality almost annihilated by hard drinking, and that in some kinds of\r\ndiseases it will restore health after all medicines have failed; but all\r\nare not willing to allow to the _awa_ the virtues claimed for it. The\r\nnatives manufacture an intoxicating drink from it which is fearful in\r\nits effects when persistently indulged in. It covers the body with dry,\r\nwhite scales, inflames the eyes, and causes premature decripitude.\r\nAlthough the man before whose establishment we stopped has to pay a\r\nGovernment license of eight hundred dollars a year for the exclusive\r\nright to sell _awa_ root, it is said that he makes a small fortune every\r\ntwelve-month; while saloon keepers, who pay a thousand dollars a year\r\nfor the privilege of retailing whiskey, etc., only make a bare living.\r\n\r\nWe found the fish market crowded; for the native is very fond of fish,\r\nand _eats the article raw and alive_! Let us change the subject.\r\n\r\nIn old times here Saturday was a grand gala day indeed. All the native\r\npopulation of the town forsook their labors, and those of the\r\nsurrounding country journeyed to the city. Then the white folks had to\r\nstay indoors, for every street was so packed with charging cavaliers and\r\ncavalieresses that it was next to impossible to thread one\xe2\x80\x99s way through\r\nthe cavalcades without getting crippled.\r\n\r\nAt night they feasted and the girls danced the lascivious _hula hula_\xe2\x80\x94a\r\ndance that is said to exhibit the very perfection of educated notion of\r\nlimb and arm, hand, head and body, and the exactest uniformity of\r\nmovement and accuracy of \xe2\x80\x9ctime.\xe2\x80\x9d It was performed by a circle of girls\r\nwith no raiment on them to speak of, who went through an infinite\r\nvariety of motions and figures without prompting, and yet so true was\r\ntheir \xe2\x80\x9ctime,\xe2\x80\x9d and in such perfect concert did they move that when they\r\nwere placed in a straight line, hands, arms, bodies, limbs and heads\r\nwaved, swayed, gesticulated, bowed, stooped, whirled, squirmed, twisted\r\nand undulated as if they were part and parcel of a single individual;\r\nand it was difficult to believe they were not moved in a body by some\r\nexquisite piece of mechanism.\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, Saturday has lost most of its quondam gala\r\nfeatures. This weekly stampede of the natives interfered too much with\r\nlabor and the interests of the white folks, and by sticking in a law\r\nhere, and preaching a sermon there, and by various other means, they\r\ngradually broke it up. The demoralizing _hula hula_ was forbidden to be\r\nperformed, save at night, with closed doors, in presence of few\r\nspectators, and only by permission duly procured from the authorities\r\nand the payment of ten dollars for the same. There are few girls now-a-\r\ndays able to dance this ancient national dance in the highest perfection\r\nof the art.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries have christianized and educated all the natives. They\r\nall belong to the Church, and there is not one of them, above the age of\r\neight years, but can read and write with facility in the native tongue.\r\nIt is the most universally educated race of people outside of China.\r\nThey have any quantity of books, printed in the Kanaka language, and all\r\nthe natives are fond of reading. They are inveterate church-\r\ngoers\xe2\x80\x94nothing can keep them away. All this ameliorating cultivation has\r\nat last built up in the native women a profound respect for chastity\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nother people. Perhaps that is enough to say on that head. The national\r\nsin will die out when the race does, but perhaps not earlier.\xe2\x80\x94But\r\ndoubtless this purifying is not far off, when we reflect that contact\r\nwith civilization and the whites has reduced the native population from\r\nfour hundred thousand (Captain Cook\xe2\x80\x99s estimate,) to _fifty-five\r\nthousand_ in something over eighty years!\r\n\r\nSociety is a queer medley in this notable missionary, whaling and\r\ngovernmental centre. If you get into conversation with a stranger and\r\nexperience that natural desire to know what sort of ground you are\r\ntreading on by finding out what manner of man your stranger is, strike\r\nout boldly and address him as \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain.\xe2\x80\x9d Watch him narrowly, and if you\r\nsee by his countenance that you are on the wrong tack, ask him where he\r\npreaches. It is a safe bet that he is either a missionary or captain of\r\na whaler. I am now personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and\r\nninety-six missionaries. The captains and ministers form one-half of the\r\npopulation; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas and\r\nmercantile foreigners and their families, and the final fourth is made\r\nup of high officers of the Hawaiian Government. And there are just about\r\ncats enough for three apiece all around.\r\n\r\nA solemn stranger met me in the suburbs the other day, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, your reverence. Preach in the stone church yonder, no\r\ndoubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a preacher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I beg your pardon, Captain. I trust you had a good season. How\r\nmuch oil\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOil? What do you take me for? I\xe2\x80\x99m not a whaler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, I beg a thousand pardons, your Excellency.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMajor General in the household troops, no doubt? Minister of the\r\nInterior, likely? Secretary of war? First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber?\r\nCommissioner of the Royal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStuff! I\xe2\x80\x99m no official. I\xe2\x80\x99m not connected in any way with the\r\nGovernment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless my life! Then, who the mischief are you? what the mischief are\r\nyou? and how the mischief did you get here, and where in thunder did you\r\ncome from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only a private personage\xe2\x80\x94an unassuming stranger\xe2\x80\x94lately arrived from\r\nAmerica.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo? Not a missionary! Not a whaler! not a member of his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nGovernment! not even Secretary of the Navy! Ah, Heaven! it is too\r\nblissful to be true; alas, I do but dream. And yet that noble, honest\r\ncountenance\xe2\x80\x94those oblique, ingenuous eyes\xe2\x80\x94that massive head, incapable\r\nof\xe2\x80\x94of\xe2\x80\x94anything; your hand; give me your hand, bright waif. Excuse these\r\ntears.

It was a dark assemblage. The nobles\r\nand Ministers (about a dozen of them altogether) occupied the extreme\r\nleft of the hall, with David Kalakaua (the King\xe2\x80\x99s Chamberlain) and\r\nPrince William at the head. The President of the Assembly, His Royal\r\nHighness M. Kekuanaoa, [Kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal. He derives\r\nhis princely rank from his wife, who was a daughter of Kamehameha the\r\nGreat. Under other monarchies the male line takes precedence of the\r\nfemale in tracing genealogies, but here the opposite is the case\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfemale line takes precedence. Their reason for this is exceedingly\r\nsensible, and I recommend it to the aristocracy of Europe: They say it\r\nis easy to know who a man\xe2\x80\x99s mother was, but, etc., etc.] and the Vice\r\nPresident (the latter a white man,) sat in the pulpit, if I may so term\r\nit. The President is the King\xe2\x80\x99s father. He is an erect, strongly built,\r\nmassive featured, white-haired, tawny old gentleman of eighty years of\r\nage or thereabouts. He was simply but well dressed, in a blue cloth coat\r\nand white vest, and white pantaloons, without spot, dust or blemish upon\r\nthem. He bears himself with a calm, stately dignity, and is a man of\r\nnoble presence. He was a young man and a distinguished warrior under\r\nthat terrific fighter, Kamehameha I., more than half a century ago. A\r\nknowledge of his career suggested some such thought as this: \xe2\x80\x9cThis man,\r\nnaked as the day he was born, and war-club and spear in hand, has\r\ncharged at the head of a horde of savages against other hordes of\r\nsavages more than a generation and a half ago, and reveled in slaughter\r\nand carnage; has worshipped wooden images on his devout knees; has seen\r\nhundreds of his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices to\r\nwooden idols, at a time when no missionary\xe2\x80\x99s foot had ever pressed this\r\nsoil, and he had never heard of the white man\xe2\x80\x99s God; has believed his\r\nenemy could secretly pray him to death; has seen the day, in his\r\nchildhood, when it was a crime punishable by death for a man to eat with\r\nhis wife, or for a plebeian to let his shadow fall upon the King\xe2\x80\x94and now\r\nlook at him; an educated Christian; neatly and handsomely dressed; a\r\nhigh-minded, elegant gentleman; a traveler, in some degree, and one who\r\nhas been the honored guest of royalty in Europe; a man practiced in\r\nholding the reins of an enlightened government, and well versed in the\r\npolitics of his country and in general, practical information. Look at\r\nhim, sitting there presiding over the deliberations of a legislative\r\nbody, among whom are white men\xe2\x80\x94a grave, dignified, statesmanlike\r\npersonage, and as seemingly natural and fitted to the place as if he had\r\nbeen born in it and had never been out of it in his life time. How the\r\nexperiences of this old man\xe2\x80\x99s eventful life shame the cheap inventions\r\nof romance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe christianizing of the natives has hardly even weakened some of their\r\nbarbarian superstitions, much less destroyed them. I have just referred\r\nto one of these. It is still a popular belief that if your enemy can get\r\nhold of any article belonging to you he can get down on his knees over\r\nit and _pray you to death_. Therefore many a native gives up and dies\r\nmerely because he _imagines_ that some enemy is putting him through a\r\ncourse of damaging prayer. This praying an individual to death seems\r\nabsurd enough at a first glance, but then when we call to mind some of\r\nthe pulpit efforts of certain of our own ministers the thing looks\r\nplausible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n482.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former times, among the Islanders, not only a plurality of wives was\r\ncustomary, but a _plurality of husbands_ likewise. Some native women of\r\nnoble rank had as many as six husbands. A woman thus supplied did not\r\nreside with all her husbands at once, but lived several months with each\r\nin turn. An understood sign hung at her door during these months. When\r\nthe sign was taken down, it meant \xe2\x80\x9cNEXT.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn those days woman was rigidly taught to \xe2\x80\x9cknow her place.\xe2\x80\x9d Her place\r\nwas to do all the work, take all the cuffs, provide all the food, and\r\ncontent herself with what was left after her lord had finished his\r\ndinner. She was not only forbidden, by ancient law, and under penalty of\r\ndeath, to eat with her husband or enter a canoe, but was debarred, under\r\nthe same penalty, from eating bananas, pine-apples, oranges and other\r\nchoice fruits at any time or in any place. She had to confine herself\r\npretty strictly to \xe2\x80\x9cpoi\xe2\x80\x9d and hard work. These poor ignorant heathen seem\r\nto have had a sort of groping idea of what came of woman eating fruit in\r\nthe garden of Eden, and they did not choose to take any more chances.\r\nBut the missionaries broke up this satisfactory arrangement of things.\r\nThey liberated woman and made her the equal of man.\r\n\r\nThe natives had a romantic fashion of burying some of their children\r\nalive when the family became larger than necessary. The missionaries\r\ninterfered in this matter too, and stopped it.\r\n\r\nTo this day the natives are able to _lie down and die whenever they want\r\nto_, whether there is anything the matter with them or not. If a Kanaka\r\ntakes a notion to die, that is the end of him; nobody can persuade him\r\nto hold on; all the doctors in the world could not save him.\r\n\r\nA luxury which they enjoy more than anything else, is a large funeral.\r\nIf a person wants to get rid of a troublesome native, it is only\r\nnecessary to promise him a fine funeral and name the hour and he will be\r\non hand to the minute\xe2\x80\x94at least his remains will.\r\n\r\nAll the natives are Christians, now, but many of them still desert to\r\nthe Great Shark God for temporary succor in time of trouble. An\r\nirruption of the great volcano of Kilauea, or an earthquake, always\r\nbrings a deal of latent loyalty to the Great Shark God to the surface.\r\nIt is common report that the King, educated, cultivated and refined\r\nChristian gentleman as he undoubtedly is, still turns to the idols of\r\nhis fathers for help when disaster threatens. A planter caught a shark,\r\nand one of his christianized natives testified his emancipation from the\r\nthrall of ancient superstition by assisting to dissect the shark after a\r\nfashion forbidden by his abandoned creed. But remorse shortly began to\r\ntorture him. He grew moody and sought solitude; brooded over his sin,\r\nrefused food, and finally said he must die and ought to die, for he had\r\nsinned against the Great Shark God and could never know peace any more.\r\nHe was proof against persuasion and ridicule, and in the course of a day\r\nor two took to his bed and died, although he showed no symptom of\r\ndisease. His young daughter followed his lead and suffered a like fate\r\nwithin the week. Superstition is ingrained in the native blood and bone\r\nand it is only natural that it should crop out in time of distress.\r\nWherever one goes in the Islands, he will find small piles of stones by\r\nthe wayside, covered with leafy offerings, placed there by the natives\r\nto appease evil spirits or honor local deities belonging to the\r\nmythology of former days.\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts of any of the Islands, the traveler hourly comes\r\nupon parties of dusky maidens bathing in the streams or in the sea\r\nwithout any clothing on and exhibiting no very intemperate zeal in the\r\nmatter of hiding their nakedness. When the missionaries first took up\r\ntheir residence in Honolulu, the native women would pay their families\r\nfrequent friendly visits, day by day, not even clothed with a blush. It\r\nwas found a hard matter to convince them that this was rather\r\nindelicate. Finally the missionaries provided them with long, loose\r\ncalico robes, and that ended the difficulty\xe2\x80\x94for the women would troop\r\nthrough the town, stark naked, with their robes folded under their arms,\r\nmarch to the missionary houses and then proceed to dress!\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n484.jpg (63K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natives soon manifested a strong proclivity for clothing, but it was\r\nshortly apparent that they only wanted it for grandeur. The missionaries\r\nimported a quantity of hats, bonnets, and other male and female wearing\r\napparel, instituted a general distribution, and begged the people not to\r\ncome to church naked, next Sunday, as usual. And they did not; but the\r\nnational spirit of unselfishness led them to divide up with neighbors\r\nwho were not at the distribution, and next Sabbath the poor preachers\r\ncould hardly keep countenance before their vast congregations. In the\r\nmidst of the reading of a hymn a brown, stately dame would sweep up the\r\naisle with a world of airs, with nothing in the world on but a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstovepipe\xe2\x80\x9d hat and a pair of cheap gloves; another dame would follow,\r\ntricked out in a man\xe2\x80\x99s shirt, and nothing else; another one would enter\r\nwith a flourish, with simply the sleeves of a bright calico dress tied\r\naround her waist and the rest of the garment dragging behind like a\r\npeacock\xe2\x80\x99s tail off duty; a stately \xe2\x80\x9cbuck\xe2\x80\x9d Kanaka would stalk in with a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s bonnet on, wrong side before\xe2\x80\x94only this, and nothing more; after\r\nhim would stride his fellow, with the legs of a pair of pantaloons tied\r\naround his neck, the rest of his person untrammeled; in his rear would\r\ncome another gentleman simply gotten up in a fiery neck-tie and a\r\nstriped vest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n485.jpg (90K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe poor creatures were beaming with complacency and wholly unconscious\r\nof any absurdity in their appearance. They gazed at each other with\r\nhappy admiration, and it was plain to see that the young girls were\r\ntaking note of what each other had on, as naturally as if they had\r\nalways lived in a land of Bibles and knew what churches were made for;\r\nhere was the evidence of a dawning civilization. The spectacle which the\r\ncongregation presented was so extraordinary and withal so moving, that\r\nthe missionaries found it difficult to keep to the text and go on with\r\nthe services; and by and by when the simple children of the sun began a\r\ngeneral swapping of garments in open meeting and produced some\r\nirresistibly grotesque effects in the course of re-dressing, there was\r\nnothing for it but to cut the thing short with the benediction and\r\ndismiss the fantastic assemblage.\r\n\r\nIn our country, children play \xe2\x80\x9ckeep house;\xe2\x80\x9d and in the same high-\r\nsounding but miniature way the grown folk here, with the poor little\r\nmaterial of slender territory and meagre population, play \xe2\x80\x9cempire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThere is his royal Majesty the King, with a New York detective\xe2\x80\x99s income\r\nof thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars a year from the \xe2\x80\x9croyal civil\r\nlist\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9croyal domain.\xe2\x80\x9d He lives in a two-story frame \xe2\x80\x9cpalace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n486.jpg (35K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there is the \xe2\x80\x9croyal family\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the customary hive of royal brothers,\r\nsisters, cousins and other noble drones and vagrants usual to\r\nmonarchy,\xe2\x80\x94all with a spoon in the national pap-dish, and all bearing\r\nsuch titles as his or her Royal Highness the Prince or Princess So-and-\r\nso. Few of them can carry their royal splendors far enough to ride in\r\ncarriages, however; they sport the economical Kanaka horse or \xe2\x80\x9choof it\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwith the plebeians.\r\n\r\nThen there is his Excellency the \xe2\x80\x9croyal Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a sinecure, for his\r\nmajesty dresses himself with his own hands, except when he is ruralizing\r\nat Waikiki and then he requires no dressing.\r\n\r\nNext we have his Excellency the Commander-in-chief of the Household\r\nTroops, whose forces consist of about the number of soldiers usually\r\nplaced under a corporal in other lands.\r\n\r\nNext comes the royal Steward and the Grand Equerry in Waiting\xe2\x80\x94high\r\ndignitaries with modest salaries and little to do.\r\n\r\nThen we have his Excellency the First Gentleman of the Bed-chamber\xe2\x80\x94an\r\noffice as easy as it is magnificent.\r\n\r\nNext we come to his Excellency the Prime Minister, a renegade American\r\nfrom New Hampshire, all jaw, vanity, bombast and ignorance, a lawyer of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cshyster\xe2\x80\x9d calibre, a fraud by nature, a humble worshipper of the sceptre\r\nabove him, a reptile never tired of sneering at the land of his birth or\r\nglorifying the ten-acre kingdom that has adopted him\xe2\x80\x94salary, $4,000 a\r\nyear, vast consequence, and no perquisites.\r\n\r\nThen we have his Excellency the Imperial Minister of Finance, who\r\nhandles a million dollars of public money a year, sends in his annual\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbudget\xe2\x80\x9d with great ceremony, talks prodigiously of \xe2\x80\x9cfinance,\xe2\x80\x9d suggests\r\nimposing schemes for paying off the \xe2\x80\x9cnational debt\xe2\x80\x9d (of $150,000,) and\r\ndoes it all for $4,000 a year and unimaginable glory.\r\n\r\nNext we have his Excellency the Minister of War, who holds sway over the\r\nroyal armies\xe2\x80\x94they consist of two hundred and thirty uniformed Kanakas,\r\nmostly Brigadier Generals, and if the country ever gets into trouble\r\nwith a foreign power we shall probably hear from them. I knew an\r\nAmerican whose copper-plate visiting card bore this impressive legend:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Infantry.\xe2\x80\x9d To say that he was proud of\r\nthis distinction is stating it but tamely. The Minister of War has also\r\nin his charge some venerable swivels on Punch-Bowl Hill wherewith royal\r\nsalutes are fired when foreign vessels of war enter the port.\r\n\r\nNext comes his Excellency the Minister of the Navy\xe2\x80\x94a nabob who rules the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9croyal fleet,\xe2\x80\x9d (a steam-tug and a sixty-ton schooner.)\r\n\r\nAnd next comes his Grace the Lord Bishop of Honolulu, the chief\r\ndignitary of the \xe2\x80\x9cEstablished Church\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for when the American Presbyterian\r\nmissionaries had completed the reduction of the nation to a compact\r\ncondition of Christianity, native royalty stepped in and erected the\r\ngrand dignity of an \xe2\x80\x9cEstablished (Episcopal) Church\xe2\x80\x9d over it, and\r\nimported a cheap ready-made Bishop from England to take charge. The\r\nchagrin of the missionaries has never been comprehensively expressed, to\r\nthis day, profanity not being admissible.\r\n\r\nNext comes his Excellency the Minister of Public Instruction.\r\n\r\nNext, their Excellencies the Governors of Oahu, Hawaii, etc., and after\r\nthem a string of High Sheriffs and other small fry too numerous for\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nThen there are their Excellencies the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of the French; her\r\nBritish Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Minister; the Minister Resident, of the United States;\r\nand some six or eight representatives of other foreign nations, all with\r\nsounding titles, imposing dignity and prodigious but economical state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n488.jpg (94K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine all this grandeur in a play-house \xe2\x80\x9ckingdom\xe2\x80\x9d whose population\r\nfalls absolutely short of sixty thousand souls!\r\n\r\nThe people are so accustomed to nine-jointed titles and colossal\r\nmagnates that a foreign prince makes very little more stir in Honolulu\r\nthan a Western Congressman does in New York.\r\n\r\nAnd let it be borne in mind that there is a strictly defined \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\r\ncostume\xe2\x80\x9d of so \xe2\x80\x9cstunning\xe2\x80\x9d a nature that it would make the clown in a\r\ncircus look tame and commonplace by comparison; and each Hawaiian\r\nofficial dignitary has a gorgeous vari-colored, gold-laced uniform\r\npeculiar to his office\xe2\x80\x94no two of them are alike, and it is hard to tell\r\nwhich one is the \xe2\x80\x9cloudest.\xe2\x80\x9d The King had a \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing-room\xe2\x80\x9d at stated\r\nintervals, like other monarchs, and when these varied uniforms\r\ncongregate there\xe2\x80\x94weak-eyed people have to contemplate the spectacle\r\nthrough smoked glass. Is there not a gratifying contrast between this\r\nlatter-day exhibition and the one the ancestors of some of these\r\nmagnates afforded the missionaries the Sunday after the old-time\r\ndistribution of clothing? Behold what religion and civilization have\r\nwrought!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n489.jpg (40K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Honolulu I witnessed the ceremonious funeral of the\r\nKing\xe2\x80\x99s sister, her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria. According to\r\nthe royal custom, the remains had lain in state at the palace _thirty\r\ndays_, watched day and night by a guard of honor. And during all that\r\ntime a great multitude of natives from the several islands had kept the\r\npalace grounds well crowded and had made the place a pandemonium every\r\nnight with their howlings and wailings, beating of tom-toms and dancing\r\nof the (at other times) forbidden \xe2\x80\x9chula-hula\xe2\x80\x9d by half-clad maidens to\r\nthe music of songs of questionable decency chanted in honor of the\r\ndeceased. The printed programme of the funeral procession interested me\r\nat the time; and after what I have just said of Hawaiian grandiloquence\r\nin the matter of \xe2\x80\x9cplaying empire,\xe2\x80\x9d I am persuaded that a perusal of it\r\nmay interest the reader:\r\n\r\nAfter reading the long list of dignitaries, etc., and remembering the\r\nsparseness of the population, one is almost inclined to wonder where the\r\nmaterial for that portion of the procession devoted to \xe2\x80\x9cHawaiian\r\nPopulation Generally\xe2\x80\x9d is going to be procured:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n490.jpg (34K) 491.jpg (105K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUndertaker.

The coffin was borne through\r\nthe door of the mausoleum, followed by the King and his chiefs, the\r\ngreat officers of the kingdom, foreign Consuls, Embassadors and\r\ndistinguished guests (Burlingame and General Van Valkenburgh). Several\r\nof the kahilis were then fastened to a frame-work in front of the tomb,\r\nthere to remain until they decay and fall to pieces, or, forestalling\r\nthis, until another scion of royalty dies. At this point of the\r\nproceedings the multitude set up such a heart-broken wailing as I hope\r\nnever to hear again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n492.jpg (90K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldiers fired three volleys of musketry\xe2\x80\x94the wailing being\r\npreviously silenced to permit of the guns being heard. His Highness\r\nPrince William, in a showy military uniform (the \xe2\x80\x9ctrue prince,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nthis\xe2\x80\x94scion of the house over-thrown by the present dynasty\xe2\x80\x94he was\r\nformerly betrothed to the Princess but was not allowed to marry her),\r\nstood guard and paced back and forth within the door. The privileged few\r\nwho followed the coffin into the mausoleum remained sometime, but the\r\nKing soon came out and stood in the door and near one side of it. A\r\nstranger could have guessed his rank (although he was so simply and\r\nunpretentiously dressed) by the profound deference paid him by all\r\npersons in his vicinity; by seeing his high officers receive his quiet\r\norders and suggestions with bowed and uncovered heads; and by observing\r\nhow careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum were to avoid\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccrowding\xe2\x80\x9d him (although there was room enough in the doorway for a\r\nwagon to pass, for that matter); how respectfully they edged out\r\nsideways, scraping their backs against the wall and always presenting a\r\nfront view of their persons to his Majesty, and never putting their hats\r\non until they were well out of the royal presence.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed entirely in black\xe2\x80\x94dress-coat and silk hat\xe2\x80\x94and looked\r\nrather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms about him. On his\r\nbreast he wore a large gold star, which was half hidden by the lapel of\r\nhis coat. He remained at the door a half hour, and occasionally gave an\r\norder to the men who were erecting the kahilis [Ranks of long-handled\r\nmops made of gaudy feathers\xe2\x80\x94sacred to royalty. They are stuck in the\r\nground around the tomb and left there.] before the tomb. He had the good\r\ntaste to make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary hempen\r\nrope he was about to tie one of them to the frame-work with. Finally he\r\nentered his carriage and drove away, and the populace shortly began to\r\ndrop into his wake. While he was in view there was but one man who\r\nattracted more attention than himself, and that was Harris (the Yankee\r\nPrime Minister). This feeble personage had crape enough around his hat\r\nto express the grief of an entire nation, and as usual he neglected no\r\nopportunity of making himself conspicuous and exciting the admiration of\r\nthe simple Kanakas. Oh! noble ambition of this modern Richelieu!\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contrast the funeral ceremonies of the Princess\r\nVictoria with those of her noted ancestor Kamehameha the Conqueror, who\r\ndied fifty years ago\xe2\x80\x94in 1819, the year before the first missionaries\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the 8th of May, 1819, at the age of sixty-six, he died, as he had\r\nlived, in the faith of his country. It was his misfortune not to have\r\ncome in contact with men who could have rightly influenced his religious\r\naspirations. Judged by his advantages and compared with the most eminent\r\nof his countrymen he may be justly styled not only great, but good. To\r\nthis day his memory warms the heart and elevates the national feelings\r\nof Hawaiians. They are proud of their old warrior King; they love his\r\nname; his deeds form their historical age; and an enthusiasm everywhere\r\nprevails, shared even by foreigners who knew his worth, that constitutes\r\nthe firmest pillar of the throne of his dynasty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn lieu of human victims (the custom of that age), a sacrifice of three\r\nhundred dogs attended his obsequies\xe2\x80\x94no mean holocaust when their\r\nnational value and the estimation in which they were held are\r\nconsidered. The bones of Kamehameha, after being kept for a while, were\r\nso carefully concealed that all knowledge of their final resting place\r\nis now lost. There was a proverb current among the common people that\r\nthe bones of a cruel King could not be hid; they made fish-hooks and\r\narrows of them, upon which, in using them, they vented their abhorrence\r\nof his memory in bitter execrations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe account of the circumstances of his death, as written by the native\r\nhistorians, is full of minute detail, but there is scarcely a line of it\r\nwhich does not mention or illustrate some by-gone custom of the country.\r\nIn this respect it is the most comprehensive document I have yet met\r\nwith. I will quote it entire:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Kamehameha was dangerously sick, and the priests were unable to\r\ncure him, they said: \xe2\x80\x98Be of good courage and build a house for the god\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(his own private god or idol), that thou mayest recover.\xe2\x80\x99 The chiefs\r\ncorroborated this advice of the priests, and a place of worship was\r\nprepared for Kukailimoku, and consecrated in the evening. They proposed\r\nalso to the King, with a view to prolong his life, that human victims\r\nshould be sacrificed to his deity; upon which the greater part of the\r\npeople absconded through fear of death, and concealed themselves in\r\nhiding places till the _tabu_ [Tabu (pronounced tah-boo,) means\r\nprohibition (we have borrowed it,) or sacred. The _tabu_ was sometimes\r\npermanent, sometimes temporary; and the person or thing placed under\r\n_tabu_ was for the time being sacred to the purpose for which it was set\r\napart. In the above case the victims selected under the _tabu_ would be\r\nsacred to the sacrifice] in which destruction impended, was past. It is\r\ndoubtful whether Kamehameha approved of the plan of the chiefs and\r\npriests to sacrifice men, as he was known to say, \xe2\x80\x98The men are sacred\r\nfor the King;\xe2\x80\x99 meaning that they were for the service of his successor.\r\nThis information was derived from Liholiho, his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this, his sickness increased to such a degree that he had not\r\nstrength to turn himself in his bed. When another season, consecrated\r\nfor worship at the new temple (heiau) arrived, he said to his son,\r\nLiholiho, \xe2\x80\x98Go thou and make supplication to thy god; I am not able to\r\ngo, and will offer my prayers at home.\xe2\x80\x99 When his devotions to his\r\nfeathered god, Kukailimoku, were concluded, a certain religiously\r\ndisposed individual, who had a bird god, suggested to the King that\r\nthrough its influence his sickness might be removed. The name of this\r\ngod was Pua; its body was made of a bird, now eaten by the Hawaiians,\r\nand called in their language alae. Kamehameha was willing that a trial\r\nshould be made, and two houses were constructed to facilitate the\r\nexperiment; but while dwelling in them he became so very weak as not to\r\nreceive food. After lying there three days, his wives, children and\r\nchiefs, perceiving that he was very low, returned him to his own house.\r\nIn the evening he was carried to the eating house, where he took a\r\nlittle food in his mouth which he did not swallow; also a cup of water.\r\nThe chiefs requested him to give them his counsel; but he made no reply,\r\nand was carried back to the dwelling house; but when near midnight\xe2\x80\x94ten\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94he was carried again to the place to eat; but, as\r\nbefore, he merely tasted of what was presented to him. Then Kaikioewa\r\naddressed him thus: \xe2\x80\x98Here we all are, your younger brethren, your son\r\nLiholiho and your foreigner; impart to us your dying charge, that\r\nLiholiho and Kaahumanu may hear.\xe2\x80\x99 Then Kamehameha inquired, \xe2\x80\x98What do you\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x99 Kaikioewa repeated, \xe2\x80\x98Your counsels for us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe then said, \xe2\x80\x98Move on in my good way and\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x99 He could proceed no\r\nfurther. The foreigner, Mr. Young, embraced and kissed him. Hoapili also\r\nembraced him, whispering something in his ear, after which he was taken\r\nback to the house. About twelve he was carried once more to the house\r\nfor eating, into which his head entered, while his body was in the\r\ndwelling house immediately adjoining. It should be remarked that this\r\nfrequent carrying of a sick chief from one house to another resulted\r\nfrom the _tabu_ system, then in force. There were at that time six\r\nhouses (huts) connected with an establishment\xe2\x80\x94one was for worship, one\r\nfor the men to eat in, an eating house for the women, a house to sleep\r\nin, a house in which to manufacture kapa (native cloth) and one where,\r\nat certain intervals, the women might dwell in seclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sick was once more taken to his house, when he expired; this was at\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock, a circumstance from which Leleiohoku derived his name. As\r\nhe breathed his last, Kalaimoku came to the eating house to order those\r\nin it to go out. There were two aged persons thus directed to depart;\r\none went, the other remained on account of love to the King, by whom he\r\nhad formerly been kindly sustained. The children also were sent away.\r\nThen Kalaimoku came to the house, and the chiefs had a consultation. One\r\nof them spoke thus: \xe2\x80\x98This is my thought\xe2\x80\x94we will eat him raw. [This\r\nsounds suspicious, in view of the fact that all Sandwich Island\r\nhistorians, white and black, protest that cannibalism never existed in\r\nthe islands. However, since they only proposed to \xe2\x80\x9ceat him raw\xe2\x80\x9d we\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t count that\xe2\x80\x9d. But it would certainly have been cannibalism if they\r\nhad cooked him.\xe2\x80\x94M. T.] Kaahumanu (one of the dead King\xe2\x80\x99s widows)\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps his body is not at our disposal; that is more properly\r\nwith his successor. Our part in him\xe2\x80\x94his breath\xe2\x80\x94has departed; his remains\r\nwill be disposed of by Liholiho.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this conversation the body was taken into the consecrated house\r\nfor the performance of the proper rites by the priest and the new King.\r\nThe name of this ceremony is uko; and when the sacred hog was baked the\r\npriest offered it to the dead body, and it became a god, the King at the\r\nsame time repeating the customary prayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the priest, addressing himself to the King and chiefs, said: \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill now make known to you the rules to be observed respecting persons\r\nto be sacrificed on the burial of this body. If you obtain one man\r\nbefore the corpse is removed, one will be sufficient; but after it\r\nleaves this house four will be required. If delayed until we carry the\r\ncorpse to the grave there must be ten; but after it is deposited in the\r\ngrave there must be fifteen. To-morrow morning there will be a _tabu_,\r\nand, if the sacrifice be delayed until that time, forty men must die.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the high priest, Hewahewa, inquired of the chiefs, \xe2\x80\x98Where shall be\r\nthe residence of King Liholiho?\xe2\x80\x99 They replied, \xe2\x80\x98Where, indeed? You, of\r\nall men, ought to know.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the priest observed, \xe2\x80\x98There are two\r\nsuitable places; one is Kau, the other is Kohala.\xe2\x80\x99 The chiefs preferred\r\nthe latter, as it was more thickly inhabited. The priest added, \xe2\x80\x98These\r\nare proper places for the King\xe2\x80\x99s residence; but he must not remain in\r\nKona, for it is polluted.\xe2\x80\x99 This was agreed to. It was now break of day.\r\nAs he was being carried to the place of burial the people perceived that\r\ntheir King was dead, and they wailed. When the corpse was removed from\r\nthe house to the tomb, a distance of one chain, the procession was met\r\nby a certain man who was ardently attached to the deceased. He leaped\r\nupon the chiefs who were carrying the King\xe2\x80\x99s body; he desired to die\r\nwith him on account of his love. The chiefs drove him away. He persisted\r\nin making numerous attempts, which were unavailing. Kalaimoka also had\r\nit in his heart to die with him, but was prevented by Hookio.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe morning following Kamehameha\xe2\x80\x99s death, Liholiho and his train\r\ndeparted for Kohala, according to the suggestions of the priest, to\r\navoid the defilement occasioned by the dead. At this time if a chief\r\ndied the land was polluted, and the heirs sought a residence in another\r\npart of the country until the corpse was dissected and the bones tied in\r\na bundle, which being done, the season of defilement terminated. If the\r\ndeceased were not a chief, the house only was defiled which became pure\r\nagain on the burial of the body. Such were the laws on this subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the morning on which Liholiho sailed in his canoe for Kohala, the\r\nchiefs and people mourned after their manner on occasion of a chief\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath, conducting themselves like madmen and like beasts. Their conduct\r\nwas such as to forbid description; The priests, also, put into action\r\nthe sorcery apparatus, that the person who had prayed the King to death\r\nmight die; for it was not believed that Kamehameha\xe2\x80\x99s departure was the\r\neffect either of sickness or old age. When the sorcerers set up by their\r\nfire-places stick with a strip of kapa flying at the top, the chief\r\nKeeaumoku, Kaahumaun\xe2\x80\x99s brother, came in a state of intoxication and\r\nbroke the flag-staff of the sorcerers, from which it was inferred that\r\nKaahumanu and her friends had been instrumental in the King\xe2\x80\x99s death. On\r\nthis account they were subjected to abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYou have the contrast, now, and a strange one it is. This great Queen,\r\nKaahumanu, who was \xe2\x80\x9csubjected to abuse\xe2\x80\x9d during the frightful orgies that\r\nfollowed the King\xe2\x80\x99s death, in accordance with ancient custom, afterward\r\nbecame a devout Christian and a steadfast and powerful friend of the\r\nmissionaries.\r\n\r\nDogs were, and still are, reared and fattened for food, by the\r\nnatives\xe2\x80\x94hence the reference to their value in one of the above\r\nparagraphs.\r\n\r\nForty years ago it was the custom in the Islands to suspend all law for\r\na certain number of days after the death of a royal personage; and then\r\na saturnalia ensued which one may picture to himself after a fashion,\r\nbut not in the full horror of the reality. The people shaved their\r\nheads, knocked out a tooth or two, plucked out an eye sometimes, cut,\r\nbruised, mutilated or burned their flesh, got drunk, burned each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhuts, maimed or murdered one another according to the caprice of the\r\nmoment, and both sexes gave themselves up to brutal and unbridled\r\nlicentiousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n497.jpg (96K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd after it all, came a torpor from which the nation slowly emerged\r\nbewildered and dazed, as if from a hideous half-remembered nightmare.\r\nThey were not the salt of the earth, those \xe2\x80\x9cgentle children of the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe natives still keep up an old custom of theirs which cannot be\r\ncomforting to an invalid. When they think a sick friend is going to die,\r\na couple of dozen neighbors surround his hut and keep up a deafening\r\nwailing night and day till he either dies or gets well. No doubt this\r\narrangement has helped many a subject to a shroud before his appointed\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThey surround a hut and wail in the same heart-broken way when its\r\noccupant returns from a journey. This is their dismal idea of a welcome.\r\nA very little of it would go a great way with most of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBound for Hawaii (a hundred and fifty miles distant,) to visit the great\r\nvolcano and behold the other notable things which distinguish that\r\nisland above the remainder of the group, we sailed from Honolulu on a\r\ncertain Saturday afternoon, in the good schooner Boomerang.\r\n\r\nThe Boomerang was about as long as two street cars, and about as wide as\r\none. She was so small (though she was larger than the majority of the\r\ninter-island coasters) that when I stood on her deck I felt but little\r\nsmaller than the Colossus of Rhodes must have felt when he had a man-of-\r\nwar under him. I could reach the water when she lay over under a strong\r\nbreeze. When the Captain and my comrade (a Mr. Billings), myself and\r\nfour other persons were all assembled on the little after portion of the\r\ndeck which is sacred to the cabin passengers, it was full\xe2\x80\x94there was not\r\nroom for any more quality folks. Another section of the deck, twice as\r\nlarge as ours, was full of natives of both sexes, with their customary\r\ndogs, mats, blankets, pipes, calabashes of poi, fleas, and other\r\nluxuries and baggage of minor importance. As soon as we set sail the\r\nnatives all lay down on the deck as thick as negroes in a slave-pen, and\r\nsmoked, conversed, and spit on each other, and were truly sociable.\r\n\r\nThe little low-ceiled cabin below was rather larger than a hearse, and\r\nas dark as a vault. It had two coffins on each side\xe2\x80\x94I mean two bunks. A\r\nsmall table, capable of accommodating three persons at dinner, stood\r\nagainst the forward bulkhead, and over it hung the dingiest whale oil\r\nlantern that ever peopled the obscurity of a dungeon with ghostly\r\nshapes. The floor room unoccupied was not extensive. One might swing a\r\ncat in it, perhaps, but not a long cat. The hold forward of the bulkhead\r\nhad but little freight in it, and from morning till night a portly old\r\nrooster, with a voice like Baalam\xe2\x80\x99s ass, and the same disposition to use\r\nit, strutted up and down in that part of the vessel and crowed. He\r\nusually took dinner at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then, after an hour devoted to\r\nmeditation, he mounted a barrel and crowed a good part of the night. He\r\ngot hoarser and hoarser all the time, but he scorned to allow any\r\npersonal consideration to interfere with his duty, and kept up his\r\nlabors in defiance of threatened diphtheria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n499.jpg (19K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSleeping was out of the question when he was on watch. He was a source\r\nof genuine aggravation and annoyance. It was worse than useless to shout\r\nat him or apply offensive epithets to him\xe2\x80\x94he only took these things for\r\napplause, and strained himself to make more noise. Occasionally, during\r\nthe day, I threw potatoes at him through an aperture in the bulkhead,\r\nbut he only dodged and went on crowing.\r\n\r\nThe first night, as I lay in my coffin, idly watching the dim lamp\r\nswinging to the rolling of the ship, and snuffing the nauseous odors of\r\nbilge water, I felt something gallop over me. I turned out promptly.\r\nHowever, I turned in again when I found it was only a rat. Presently\r\nsomething galloped over me once more. I knew it was not a rat this time,\r\nand I thought it might be a centipede, because the Captain had killed\r\none on deck in the afternoon. I turned out. The first glance at the\r\npillow showed me repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of\r\nit\xe2\x80\x94cockroaches as large as peach leaves\xe2\x80\x94fellows with long, quivering\r\nantennae and fiery, malignant eyes. They were grating their teeth like\r\ntobacco worms, and appeared to be dissatisfied about something. I had\r\noften heard that these reptiles were in the habit of eating off sleeping\r\nsailors\xe2\x80\x99 toe nails down to the quick, and I would not get in the bunk\r\nany more. I lay down on the floor. But a rat came and bothered me, and\r\nshortly afterward a procession of cockroaches arrived and camped in my\r\nhair. In a few moments the rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and\r\na party of fleas were throwing double somersaults about my person in the\r\nwildest disorder, and taking a bite every time they struck. I was\r\nbeginning to feel really annoyed. I got up and put my clothes on and\r\nwent on deck.\r\n\r\nThe above is not overdrawn; it is a truthful sketch of inter-island\r\nschooner life. There is no such thing as keeping a vessel in elegant\r\ncondition, when she carries molasses and Kanakas.\r\n\r\nIt was compensation for my sufferings to come unexpectedly upon so\r\nbeautiful a scene as met my eye\xe2\x80\x94to step suddenly out of the sepulchral\r\ngloom of the cabin and stand under the strong light of the moon\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\ncentre, as it were, of a glittering sea of liquid silver\xe2\x80\x94to see the\r\nbroad sails straining in the gale, the ship heeled over on her side, the\r\nangry foam hissing past her lee bulwarks, and sparkling sheets of spray\r\ndashing high over her bows and raining upon her decks; to brace myself\r\nand hang fast to the first object that presented itself, with hat jammed\r\ndown and coat tails whipping in the breeze, and feel that exhilaration\r\nthat thrills in one\xe2\x80\x99s hair and quivers down his back bone when he knows\r\nthat every inch of canvas is drawing and the vessel cleaving through the\r\nwaves at her utmost speed. There was no darkness, no dimness, no\r\nobscurity there. All was brightness, every object was vividly defined.\r\nEvery prostrate Kanaka; every coil of rope; every calabash of poi; every\r\npuppy; every seam in the flooring; every bolthead; every object; however\r\nminute, showed sharp and distinct in its every outline; and the shadow\r\nof the broad mainsail lay black as a pall upon the deck, leaving\r\nBillings\xe2\x80\x99s white upturned face glorified and his body in a total\r\neclipse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n501.jpg (93K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning we were close to the island of Hawaii. Two of its high\r\nmountains were in view\xe2\x80\x94Mauna Loa and Hualaiai. The latter is an imposing\r\npeak, but being only ten thousand feet high is seldom mentioned or heard\r\nof. Mauna Loa is said to be sixteen thousand feet high. The rays of\r\nglittering snow and ice, that clasped its summit like a claw, looked\r\nrefreshing when viewed from the blistering climate we were in. One could\r\nstand on that mountain (wrapped up in blankets and furs to keep warm),\r\nand while he nibbled a snowball or an icicle to quench his thirst he\r\ncould look down the long sweep of its sides and see spots where plants\r\nare growing that grow only where the bitter cold of Winter prevails;\r\nlower down he could see sections devoted to production that thrive in\r\nthe temperate zone alone; and at the bottom of the mountain he could see\r\nthe home of the tufted cocoa-palms and other species of vegetation that\r\ngrow only in the sultry atmosphere of eternal Summer. He could see all\r\nthe climes of the world at a single glance of the eye, and that glance\r\nwould only pass over a distance of four or five miles as the bird flies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n502.jpg (162K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy and by we took boat and went ashore at Kailua, designing to ride\r\nhorseback through the pleasant orange and coffee region of Kona, and\r\nrejoin the vessel at a point some leagues distant. This journey is well\r\nworth taking. The trail passes along on high ground\xe2\x80\x94say a thousand feet\r\nabove sea level\xe2\x80\x94and usually about a mile distant from the ocean, which\r\nis always in sight, save that occasionally you find yourself buried in\r\nthe forest in the midst of a rank tropical vegetation and a dense growth\r\nof trees, whose great bows overarch the road and shut out sun and sea\r\nand everything, and leave you in a dim, shady tunnel, haunted with\r\ninvisible singing birds and fragrant with the odor of flowers. It was\r\npleasant to ride occasionally in the warm sun, and feast the eye upon\r\nthe ever-changing panorama of the forest (beyond and below us), with its\r\nmany tints, its softened lights and shadows, its billowy undulations\r\nsweeping gently down from the mountain to the sea. It was pleasant also,\r\nat intervals, to leave the sultry sun and pass into the cool, green\r\ndepths of this forest and indulge in sentimental reflections under the\r\ninspiration of its brooding twilight and its whispering foliage. We rode\r\nthrough one orange grove that had ten thousand trees in it! They were\r\nall laden with fruit.\r\n\r\nAt one farmhouse we got some large peaches of excellent flavor. This\r\nfruit, as a general thing, does not do well in the Sandwich Islands. It\r\ntakes a sort of almond shape, and is small and bitter. It needs frost,\r\nthey say, and perhaps it does; if this be so, it will have a good\r\nopportunity to go on needing it, as it will not be likely to get it. The\r\ntrees from which the fine fruit I have spoken of, came, had been planted\r\nand replanted _sixteen times_, and to this treatment the proprietor of\r\nthe orchard attributed his success.\r\n\r\nWe passed several sugar plantations\xe2\x80\x94new ones and not very extensive. The\r\ncrops were, in most cases, third rattoons. [NOTE.\xe2\x80\x94The first crop is\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cplant cane;\xe2\x80\x9d subsequent crops which spring from the original\r\nroots, without replanting, are called \xe2\x80\x9crattoons.\xe2\x80\x9d] Almost everywhere on\r\nthe island of Hawaii sugar-cane matures in twelve months, both rattoons\r\nand plant, and although it ought to be taken off as soon as it tassels,\r\nno doubt, it is not absolutely necessary to do it until about four\r\nmonths afterward. In Kona, the average yield of an acre of ground is\r\n_two tons_ of sugar, they say. This is only a moderate yield for these\r\nislands, but would be astounding for Louisiana and most other sugar\r\ngrowing countries. The plantations in Kona being on pretty high\r\nground\xe2\x80\x94up among the light and frequent rains\xe2\x80\x94no irrigation whatever is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n503.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe stopped some time at one of the plantations, to rest ourselves and\r\nrefresh the horses. We had a chatty conversation with several gentlemen\r\npresent; but there was one person, a middle aged man, with an absent\r\nlook in his face, who simply glanced up, gave us good-day and lapsed\r\nagain into the meditations which our coming had interrupted. The\r\nplanters whispered us not to mind him\xe2\x80\x94crazy. They said he was in the\r\nIslands for his health; was a preacher; his home, Michigan. They said\r\nthat if he woke up presently and fell to talking about a correspondence\r\nwhich he had some time held with Mr. Greeley about a trifle of some\r\nkind, we must humor him and listen with interest; and we must humor his\r\nfancy that this correspondence was the talk of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n505.jpg (46K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see that he was a gentle creature and that his madness\r\nhad nothing vicious in it. He looked pale, and a little worn, as if with\r\nperplexing thought and anxiety of mind. He sat a long time, looking at\r\nthe floor, and at intervals muttering to himself and nodding his head\r\nacquiescingly or shaking it in mild protest. He was lost in his thought,\r\nor in his memories. We continued our talk with the planters, branching\r\nfrom subject to subject. But at last the word \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstance,\xe2\x80\x9d casually\r\ndropped, in the course of conversation, attracted his attention and\r\nbrought an eager look into his countenance. He faced about in his chair\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCircumstance? What circumstance? Ah, I know\xe2\x80\x94I know too well. So you\r\nhave heard of it too.\xe2\x80\x9d [With a sigh.] \xe2\x80\x9cWell, no matter\xe2\x80\x94all the world has\r\nheard of it. All the world. The whole world. It is a large world, too,\r\nfor a thing to travel so far in\xe2\x80\x94now isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Yes, yes\xe2\x80\x94the Greeley\r\ncorrespondence with Erickson has created the saddest and bitterest\r\ncontroversy on both sides of the ocean\xe2\x80\x94and still they keep it up! It\r\nmakes us famous, but at what a sorrowful sacrifice! I was so sorry when\r\nI heard that it had caused that bloody and distressful war over there in\r\nItaly. It was little comfort to me, after so much bloodshed, to know\r\nthat the victors sided with me, and the vanquished with Greeley.\xe2\x80\x94It is\r\nlittle comfort to know that Horace Greeley is responsible for the battle\r\nof Sadowa, and not me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQueen Victoria wrote me that she felt just as I did about it\xe2\x80\x94she said\r\nthat as much as she was opposed to Greeley and the spirit he showed in\r\nthe correspondence with me, she would not have had Sadowa happen for\r\nhundreds of dollars. I can show you her letter, if you would like to see\r\nit. But gentlemen, much as you may think you know about that unhappy\r\ncorrespondence, you cannot know the _straight_ of it till you hear it\r\nfrom my lips. It has always been garbled in the journals, and even in\r\nhistory. Yes, even in history\xe2\x80\x94think of it! Let me\xe2\x80\x94_please_ let me, give\r\nyou the matter, exactly as it occurred. I truly will not abuse your\r\nconfidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen he leaned forward, all interest, all earnestness, and told his\r\nstory\xe2\x80\x94and told it appealingly, too, and yet in the simplest and most\r\nunpretentious way; indeed, in such a way as to suggest to one, all the\r\ntime, that this was a faithful, honorable witness, giving evidence in\r\nthe sacred interest of justice, and under oath. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Beazeley\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Jackson Beazeley, widow, of the village of\r\nCampbellton, Kansas,\xe2\x80\x94wrote me about a matter which was near her heart\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nmatter which many might think trivial, but to her it was a thing of deep\r\nconcern. I was living in Michigan, then\xe2\x80\x94serving in the ministry. She\r\nwas, and is, an estimable woman\xe2\x80\x94a woman to whom poverty and hardship\r\nhave proven incentives to industry, in place of discouragements. Her\r\nonly treasure was her son William, a youth just verging upon manhood;\r\nreligious, amiable, and sincerely attached to agriculture. He was the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s comfort and her pride. And so, moved by her love for him, she\r\nwrote me about a matter, as I have said before, which lay near her\r\nheart\xe2\x80\x94because it lay near her boy\xe2\x80\x99s. She desired me to confer with Mr.\r\nGreeley about turnips. Turnips were the dream of her child\xe2\x80\x99s young\r\nambition. While other youths were frittering away in frivolous\r\namusements the precious years of budding vigor which God had given them\r\nfor useful preparation, this boy was patiently enriching his mind with\r\ninformation concerning turnips. The sentiment which he felt toward the\r\nturnip was akin to adoration. He could not think of the turnip without\r\nemotion; he could not speak of it calmly; he could not contemplate it\r\nwithout exaltation. He could not eat it without shedding tears. All the\r\npoetry in his sensitive nature was in sympathy with the gracious\r\nvegetable. With the earliest pipe of dawn he sought his patch, and when\r\nthe curtaining night drove him from it he shut himself up with his books\r\nand garnered statistics till sleep overcame him. On rainy days he sat\r\nand talked hours together with his mother about turnips. When company\r\ncame, he made it his loving duty to put aside everything else and\r\nconverse with them all the day long of his great joy in the turnip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n507.jpg (67K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, was this joy rounded and complete? Was there no secret alloy\r\nof unhappiness in it? Alas, there was. There was a canker gnawing at his\r\nheart; the noblest inspiration of his soul eluded his endeavor\xe2\x80\x94viz: he\r\ncould not make of the turnip a climbing vine. Months went by; the bloom\r\nforsook his cheek, the fire faded out of his eye; sighings and\r\nabstraction usurped the place of smiles and cheerful converse. But a\r\nwatchful eye noted these things and in time a motherly sympathy unsealed\r\nthe secret. Hence the letter to me. She pleaded for attention\xe2\x80\x94she said\r\nher boy was dying by inches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was a stranger to Mr. Greeley, but what of that? The matter was\r\nurgent. I wrote and begged him to solve the difficult problem if\r\npossible and save the student\xe2\x80\x99s life. My interest grew, until it partook\r\nof the anxiety of the mother. I waited in much suspense.\xe2\x80\x94At last the\r\nanswer came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n509.jpg (127K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI found that I could not read it readily, the handwriting being\r\nunfamiliar and my emotions somewhat wrought up. It seemed to refer in\r\npart to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s case, but chiefly to other and irrelevant matters\xe2\x80\x94such\r\nas paving-stones, electricity, oysters, and something which I took to be\r\n\xe2\x80\x98absolution\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98agrarianism,\xe2\x80\x99 I could not be certain which; still,\r\nthese appeared to be simply casual mentions, nothing more; friendly in\r\nspirit, without doubt, but lacking the connection or coherence necessary\r\nto make them useful.\xe2\x80\x94I judged that my understanding was affected by my\r\nfeelings, and so laid the letter away till morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the morning I read it again, but with difficulty and uncertainty\r\nstill, for I had lost some little rest and my mental vision seemed\r\nclouded. The note was more connected, now, but did not meet the\r\nemergency it was expected to meet. It was too discursive. It appeared to\r\nread as follows, though I was not certain of some of the words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPolygamy dissembles majesty; extracts redeem polarity; causes hitherto\r\nexist. Ovations pursue wisdom, or warts inherit and condemn. Boston,\r\nbotany, cakes, folony undertakes, but who shall allay? We fear not.\r\nYrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there did not seem to be a word about turnips. There seemed to be\r\nno suggestion as to how they might be made to grow like vines. There was\r\nnot even a reference to the Beazeleys. I slept upon the matter; I ate no\r\nsupper, neither any breakfast next morning. So I resumed my work with a\r\nbrain refreshed, and was very hopeful. _Now_ the letter took a different\r\naspect\xe2\x80\x94all save the signature, which latter I judged to be only a\r\nharmless affectation of Hebrew. The epistle was necessarily from Mr.\r\nGreeley, for it bore the printed heading of The _Tribune_, and I had\r\nwritten to no one else there. The letter, I say, had taken a different\r\naspect, but still its language was eccentric and avoided the issue. It\r\nnow appeared to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBolivia extemporizes mackerel; borax esteems polygamy; sausages wither\r\nin the east. Creation perdu, is done; for woes inherent one can damn.\r\nButtons, buttons, corks, geology underrates but we shall allay. My\r\nbeer\xe2\x80\x99s out. Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was evidently overworked. My comprehension was impaired. Therefore I\r\ngave two days to recreation, and then returned to my task greatly\r\nrefreshed. The letter now took this form:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoultices do sometimes choke swine; tulips reduce posterity; causes\r\nleather to resist. Our notions empower wisdom, her let\xe2\x80\x99s afford while we\r\ncan. Butter but any cakes, fill any undertaker, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wean him from his\r\nfilly. We feel hot. Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was still not satisfied. These generalities did not meet the\r\nquestion. They were crisp, and vigorous, and delivered with a confidence\r\nthat almost compelled conviction; but at such a time as this, with a\r\nhuman life at stake, they seemed inappropriate, worldly, and in bad\r\ntaste. At any other time I would have been not only glad, but proud, to\r\nreceive from a man like Mr. Greeley a letter of this kind, and would\r\nhave studied it earnestly and tried to improve myself all I could; but\r\nnow, with that poor boy in his far home languishing for relief, I had no\r\nheart for learning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree days passed by, and I read the note again. Again its tenor had\r\nchanged. It now appeared to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPotations do sometimes wake wines; turnips restrain passion; causes\r\nnecessary to state. Infest the poor widow; her lord\xe2\x80\x99s effects will be\r\nvoid. But dirt, bathing, etc., etc., followed unfairly, will worm him\r\nfrom his folly\xe2\x80\x94so swear not. Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis was more like it. But I was unable to proceed. I was too much\r\nworn. The word \xe2\x80\x98turnips\xe2\x80\x99 brought temporary joy and encouragement, but my\r\nstrength was so much impaired, and the delay might be so perilous for\r\nthe boy, that I relinquished the idea of pursuing the translation\r\nfurther, and resolved to do what I ought to have done at first. I sat\r\ndown and wrote Mr. Greeley as follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDEAR SIR: I fear I do not entirely comprehend your kind note. It cannot\r\nbe possible, Sir, that \xe2\x80\x98turnips restrain passion\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94at least the study or\r\ncontemplation of turnips cannot\xe2\x80\x94for it is this very employment that has\r\nscorched our poor friend\xe2\x80\x99s mind and sapped his bodily strength.\xe2\x80\x94But if\r\nthey do restrain it, will you bear with us a little further and explain\r\nhow they should be prepared? I observe that you say \xe2\x80\x98causes necessary to\r\nstate,\xe2\x80\x99 but you have omitted to state them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnder a misapprehension, you seem to attribute to me interested motives\r\nin this matter\xe2\x80\x94to call it by no harsher term. But I assure you, dear\r\nsir, that if I seem to be \xe2\x80\x98infesting the widow,\xe2\x80\x99 it is all seeming, and\r\nvoid of reality. It is from no seeking of mine that I am in this\r\nposition. She asked me, herself, to write you. I never have infested\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94indeed I scarcely know her. I do not infest anybody. I try to go\r\nalong, in my humble way, doing as near right as I can, never harming\r\nanybody, and never throwing out insinuations.

Very\r\nTruly Yours, SIMON ERICKSON.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the course of a few days, Mr. Greely did what would have saved a\r\nworld of trouble, and much mental and bodily suffering and\r\nmisunderstanding, if he had done it sooner. To wit, he sent an\r\nintelligible rescript or translation of his original note, made in a\r\nplain hand by his clerk. Then the mystery cleared, and I saw that his\r\nheart had been right, all the time. I will recite the note in its\r\nclarified form:\r\n\r\n[Translation.] \xe2\x80\x98Potatoes do sometimes make vines; turnips remain\r\npassive: cause unnecessary to state. Inform the poor widow her lad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nefforts will be vain. But diet, bathing, etc. etc., followed uniformly,\r\nwill wean him from his folly\xe2\x80\x94so fear not.

His spirit had taken its flight\r\nto a land where all anxieties shall be charmed away, all desires\r\ngratified, all ambitions realized. Poor lad, they laid him to his rest\r\nwith a turnip in each hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo ended Erickson, and lapsed again into nodding, mumbling, and\r\nabstraction. The company broke up, and left him so.... But they did not\r\nsay what drove him crazy. In the momentary confusion, I forgot to ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon we were winding down a mountain of\r\ndreary and desolate lava to the sea, and closing our pleasant land\r\njourney. This lava is the accumulation of ages; one torrent of fire\r\nafter another has rolled down here in old times, and built up the island\r\nstructure higher and higher. Underneath, it is honey-combed with caves;\r\nit would be of no use to dig wells in such a place; they would not hold\r\nwater\xe2\x80\x94you would not find any for them to hold, for that matter.\r\nConsequently, the planters depend upon cisterns.\r\n\r\nThe last lava flow occurred here so long ago that there are none now\r\nliving who witnessed it. In one place it enclosed and burned down a\r\ngrove of cocoa-nut trees, and the holes in the lava where the trunks\r\nstood are still visible; their sides retain the impression of the bark;\r\nthe trees fell upon the burning river, and becoming partly submerged,\r\nleft in it the perfect counterpart of every knot and branch and leaf,\r\nand even nut, for curiosity seekers of a long distant day to gaze upon\r\nand wonder at.\r\n\r\nThere were doubtless plenty of Kanaka sentinels on guard hereabouts at\r\nthat time, but they did not leave casts of their figures in the lava as\r\nthe Roman sentinels at Herculaneum and Pompeii did. It is a pity it is\r\nso, because such things are so interesting; but so it is. They probably\r\nwent away. They went away early, perhaps. However, they had their\r\nmerits; the Romans exhibited the higher pluck, but the Kanakas showed\r\nthe sounder judgment.\r\n\r\nShortly we came in sight of that spot whose history is so familiar to\r\nevery school-boy in the wide world\xe2\x80\x94_Kealakekua_ Bay\xe2\x80\x94the place where\r\nCaptain Cook, the great circumnavigator, was killed by the natives,\r\nnearly a hundred years ago. The setting sun was flaming upon it, a\r\nSummer shower was falling, and it was spanned by two magnificent\r\nrainbows. Two men who were in advance of us rode through one of these\r\nand for a moment their garments shone with a more than regal splendor.\r\nWhy did not Captain Cook have taste enough to call his great discovery\r\nthe Rainbow Islands? These charming spectacles are present to you at\r\nevery turn; they are common in all the islands; they are visible every\r\nday, and frequently at night also\xe2\x80\x94not the silvery bow we see once in an\r\nage in the States, by moonlight, but barred with all bright and\r\nbeautiful colors, like the children of the sun and rain. I saw one of\r\nthem a few nights ago. What the sailors call \xe2\x80\x9craindogs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94little patches\r\nof rainbow\xe2\x80\x94are often seen drifting about the heavens in these latitudes,\r\nlike stained cathedral windows.\r\n\r\n_Kealakekua_ Bay is a little curve like the last kink of a snail-shell,\r\nwinding deep into the land, seemingly not more than a mile wide from\r\nshore to shore. It is bounded on one side\xe2\x80\x94where the murder was done\xe2\x80\x94by a\r\nlittle flat plain, on which stands a cocoanut grove and some ruined\r\nhouses; a steep wall of lava, a thousand feet high at the upper end and\r\nthree or four hundred at the lower, comes down from the mountain and\r\nbounds the inner extremity of it. From this wall the place takes its\r\nname, _Kealakekua_, which in the native tongue signifies \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pathway of\r\nthe Gods.\xe2\x80\x9d They say, (and still believe, in spite of their liberal\r\neducation in Christianity), that the great god _Lono_, who used to live\r\nupon the hillside, always traveled that causeway when urgent business\r\nconnected with heavenly affairs called him down to the seashore in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nAs the red sun looked across the placid ocean through the tall, clean\r\nstems of the cocoanut trees, like a blooming whiskey bloat through the\r\nbars of a city prison, I went and stood in the edge of the water on the\r\nflat rock pressed by Captain Cook\xe2\x80\x99s feet when the blow was dealt which\r\ntook away his life, and tried to picture in my mind the doomed man\r\nstruggling in the midst of the multitude of exasperated savages\xe2\x80\x94the men\r\nin the ship crowding to the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s side and gazing in anxious dismay\r\ntoward the shore\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94but I discovered that I could not do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n514.jpg (93K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was growing dark, the rain began to fall, we could see that the\r\ndistant Boomerang was helplessly becalmed at sea, and so I adjourned to\r\nthe cheerless little box of a warehouse and sat down to smoke and think,\r\nand wish the ship would make the land\xe2\x80\x94for we had not eaten much for ten\r\nhours and were viciously hungry.\r\n\r\nPlain unvarnished history takes the romance out of Captain Cook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassassination, and renders a deliberate verdict of justifiable homicide.\r\nWherever he went among the islands, he was cordially received and\r\nwelcomed by the inhabitants, and his ships lavishly supplied with all\r\nmanner of food. He returned these kindnesses with insult and ill-\r\ntreatment. Perceiving that the people took him for the long vanished and\r\nlamented god _Lono_, he encouraged them in the delusion for the sake of\r\nthe limitless power it gave him; but during the famous disturbance at\r\nthis spot, and while he and his comrades were surrounded by fifteen\r\nthousand maddened savages, he received a hurt and betrayed his earthly\r\norigin with a groan. It was his death-warrant. Instantly a shout went\r\nup: \xe2\x80\x9cHe groans!\xe2\x80\x94he is not a god!\xe2\x80\x9d So they closed in upon him and\r\ndispatched him.\r\n\r\nHis flesh was stripped from the bones and burned (except nine pounds of\r\nit which were sent on board the ships). The heart was hung up in a\r\nnative hut, where it was found and eaten by three children, who mistook\r\nit for the heart of a dog. One of these children grew to be a very old\r\nman, and died in Honolulu a few years ago. Some of Cook\xe2\x80\x99s bones were\r\nrecovered and consigned to the deep by the officers of the ships.\r\n\r\nSmall blame should attach to the natives for the killing of Cook. They\r\ntreated him well. In return, he abused them. He and his men inflicted\r\nbodily injury upon many of them at different times, and killed at least\r\nthree of them before they offered any proportionate retaliation.\r\n\r\nNear the shore we found \xe2\x80\x9cCook\xe2\x80\x99s Monument\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94only a cocoanut stump, four\r\nfeet high and about a foot in diameter at the butt. It had lava boulders\r\npiled around its base to hold it up and keep it in its place, and it was\r\nentirely sheathed over, from top to bottom, with rough, discolored\r\nsheets of copper, such as ships\xe2\x80\x99 bottoms are coppered with. Each sheet\r\nhad a rude inscription scratched upon it\xe2\x80\x94with a nail, apparently\xe2\x80\x94and in\r\nevery case the execution was wretched. Most of these merely recorded the\r\nvisits of British naval commanders to the spot, but one of them bore\r\nthis legend:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear this spot fell CAPTAIN JAMES COOK, The Distinguished\r\nCircumnavigator, who Discovered these Islands A. D. 1778.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter Cook\xe2\x80\x99s murder, his second in command, on board the ship, opened\r\nfire upon the swarms of natives on the beach, and one of his cannon\r\nballs cut this cocoanut tree short off and left this monumental stump\r\nstanding. It looked sad and lonely enough to us, out there in the rainy\r\ntwilight. But there is no other monument to Captain Cook. True, up on\r\nthe mountain side we had passed by a large inclosure like an ample hog-\r\npen, built of lava blocks, which marks the spot where Cook\xe2\x80\x99s flesh was\r\nstripped from his bones and burned; but this is not properly a monument\r\nsince it was erected by the natives themselves, and less to do honor to\r\nthe circumnavigator than for the sake of convenience in roasting him. A\r\nthing like a guide-board was elevated above this pen on a tall pole, and\r\nformerly there was an inscription upon it describing the memorable\r\noccurrence that had there taken place; but the sun and the wind have\r\nlong ago so defaced it as to render it illegible.\r\n\r\nToward midnight a fine breeze sprang up and the schooner soon worked\r\nherself into the bay and cast anchor. The boat came ashore for us, and\r\nin a little while the clouds and the rain were all gone. The moon was\r\nbeaming tranquilly down on land and sea, and we two were stretched upon\r\nthe deck sleeping the refreshing sleep and dreaming the happy dreams\r\nthat are only vouchsafed to the weary and the innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the breezy morning we went ashore and visited the ruined temple of\r\nthe last god _Lono_. The high chief cook of this temple\xe2\x80\x94the priest who\r\npresided over it and roasted the human sacrifices\xe2\x80\x94was uncle to Obookia,\r\nand at one time that youth was an apprentice-priest under him. Obookia\r\nwas a young native of fine mind, who, together with three other native\r\nboys, was taken to New England by the captain of a whaleship during the\r\nreign of Kamehameha I, and they were the means of attracting the\r\nattention of the religious world to their country. This resulted in the\r\nsending of missionaries there. And this Obookia was the very same\r\nsensitive savage who sat down on the church steps and wept because his\r\npeople did not have the Bible. That incident has been very elaborately\r\npainted in many a charming Sunday School book\xe2\x80\x94aye, and told so\r\nplaintively and so tenderly that I have cried over it in Sunday School\r\nmyself, on general principles, although at a time when I did not know\r\nmuch and could not understand why the people of the Sandwich Islands\r\nneeded to worry so much about it as long as they did not know there was\r\na Bible at all.\r\n\r\nObookia was converted and educated, and was to have returned to his\r\nnative land with the first missionaries, had he lived. The other native\r\nyouths made the voyage, and two of them did good service, but the third,\r\nWilliam Kanui, fell from grace afterward, for a time, and when the gold\r\nexcitement broke out in California he journeyed thither and went to\r\nmining, although he was fifty years old. He succeeded pretty well, but\r\nthe failure of Page, Bacon & Co. relieved him of six thousand dollars,\r\nand then, to all intents and purposes, he was a bankrupt in his old age\r\nand he resumed service in the pulpit again. He died in Honolulu in 1864.\r\n\r\nQuite a broad tract of land near the temple, extending from the sea to\r\nthe mountain top, was sacred to the god _Lono_ in olden times\xe2\x80\x94so sacred\r\nthat if a common native set his sacrilegious foot upon it it was\r\njudicious for him to make his will, because his time had come. He might\r\ngo around it by water, but he could not cross it. It was well sprinkled\r\nwith pagan temples and stocked with awkward, homely idols carved out of\r\nlogs of wood. There was a temple devoted to prayers for rain\xe2\x80\x94and with\r\nfine sagacity it was placed at a point so well up on the mountain side\r\nthat if you prayed there twenty-four times a day for rain you would be\r\nlikely to get it every time. You would seldom get to your Amen before\r\nyou would have to hoist your umbrella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n518.jpg (54K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there was a large temple near at hand which was built in a single\r\nnight, in the midst of storm and thunder and rain, by the ghastly hands\r\nof dead men! Tradition says that by the weird glare of the lightning a\r\nnoiseless multitude of phantoms were seen at their strange labor far up\r\nthe mountain side at dead of night\xe2\x80\x94flitting hither and thither and\r\nbearing great lava-blocks clasped in their nerveless fingers\xe2\x80\x94appearing\r\nand disappearing as the pallid lustre fell upon their forms and faded\r\naway again. Even to this day, it is said, the natives hold this dread\r\nstructure in awe and reverence, and will not pass by it in the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n519.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt noon I observed a bevy of nude native young ladies bathing in the\r\nsea, and went and sat down on their clothes to keep them from being\r\nstolen. I begged them to come out, for the sea was rising and I was\r\nsatisfied that they were running some risk. But they were not afraid,\r\nand presently went on with their sport. They were finished swimmers and\r\ndivers, and enjoyed themselves to the last degree.\r\n\r\nThey swam races, splashed and ducked and tumbled each other about, and\r\nfilled the air with their laughter. It is said that the first thing an\r\nIslander learns is how to swim; learning to walk being a matter of\r\nsmaller consequence, comes afterward. One hears tales of native men and\r\nwomen swimming ashore from vessels many miles at sea\xe2\x80\x94more miles, indeed,\r\nthan I dare vouch for or even mention. And they tell of a native diver\r\nwho went down in thirty or forty-foot waters and brought up an anvil! I\r\nthink he swallowed the anvil afterward, if my memory serves me. However\r\nI will not urge this point.\r\n\r\nI have spoken, several times, of the god _Lono_\xe2\x80\x94I may as well furnish\r\ntwo or three sentences concerning him.\r\n\r\nThe idol the natives worshipped for him was a slender, unornamented\r\nstaff twelve feet long. Tradition says he was a favorite god on the\r\nIsland of Hawaii\xe2\x80\x94a great king who had been deified for meritorious\r\nservices\xe2\x80\x94just our own fashion of rewarding heroes, with the difference\r\nthat we would have made him a Postmaster instead of a god, no doubt. In\r\nan angry moment he slew his wife, a goddess named Kaikilani Aiii.\r\nRemorse of conscience drove him mad, and tradition presents us the\r\nsingular spectacle of a god traveling \xe2\x80\x9con the shoulder;\xe2\x80\x9d for in his\r\ngnawing grief he wandered about from place to place boxing and wrestling\r\nwith all whom he met. Of course this pastime soon lost its novelty,\r\ninasmuch as it must necessarily have been the case that when so powerful\r\na deity sent a frail human opponent \xe2\x80\x9cto grass\xe2\x80\x9d he never came back any\r\nmore. Therefore, he instituted games called makahiki, and ordered that\r\nthey should be held in his honor, and then sailed for foreign lands on a\r\nthree-cornered raft, stating that he would return some day\xe2\x80\x94and that was\r\nthe last of _Lono_. He was never seen any more; his raft got swamped,\r\nperhaps. But the people always expected his return, and thus they were\r\neasily led to accept Captain Cook as the restored god.\r\n\r\nSome of the old natives believed Cook was _Lono_ to the day of their\r\ndeath; but many did not, for they could not understand how he could die\r\nif he was a god.\r\n\r\nOnly a mile or so from _Kealakekua_ Bay is a spot of historic\r\ninterest\xe2\x80\x94the place where the last battle was fought for idolatry. Of\r\ncourse we visited it, and came away as wise as most people do who go and\r\ngaze upon such mementoes of the past when in an unreflective mood.\r\n\r\nWhile the first missionaries were on their way around the Horn, the\r\nidolatrous customs which had obtained in the island, as far back as\r\ntradition reached were suddenly broken up. Old Kamehameha I., was dead,\r\nand his son, Liholiho, the new King was a free liver, a roystering,\r\ndissolute fellow, and hated the restraints of the ancient _tabu_. His\r\nassistant in the Government, Kaahumanu, the Queen dowager, was proud and\r\nhigh-spirited, and hated the _tabu_ because it restricted the privileges\r\nof her sex and degraded all women very nearly to the level of brutes. So\r\nthe case stood. Liholiho had half a mind to put his foot down, Kaahumahu\r\nhad a whole mind to badger him into doing it, and whiskey did the rest.\r\nIt was probably the rest. It was probably the first time whiskey ever\r\nprominently figured as an aid to civilization. Liholiho came up to\r\nKailua as drunk as a piper, and attended a great feast; the determined\r\nQueen spurred his drunken courage up to a reckless pitch, and then,\r\nwhile all the multitude stared in blank dismay, he moved deliberately\r\nforward and sat down with the women!\r\n\r\nThey saw him eat from the same vessel with them, and were appalled!\r\nTerrible moments drifted slowly by, and still the King ate, still he\r\nlived, still the lightnings of the insulted gods were withheld! Then\r\nconviction came like a revelation\xe2\x80\x94the superstitions of a hundred\r\ngenerations passed from before the people like a cloud, and a shout went\r\nup, \xe2\x80\x9cthe _tabu_ is broken! the _tabu_ is broken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n521.jpg (100K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus did King Liholiho and his dreadful whiskey preach the first sermon\r\nand prepare the way for the new gospel that was speeding southward over\r\nthe waves of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe _tabu_ broken and destruction failing to follow the awful sacrilege,\r\nthe people, with that childlike precipitancy which has always\r\ncharacterized them, jumped to the conclusion that their gods were a weak\r\nand wretched swindle, just as they formerly jumped to the conclusion\r\nthat Captain Cook was no god, merely because he groaned, and promptly\r\nkilled him without stopping to inquire whether a god might not groan as\r\nwell as a man if it suited his convenience to do it; and satisfied that\r\nthe idols were powerless to protect themselves they went to work at once\r\nand pulled them down\xe2\x80\x94hacked them to pieces\xe2\x80\x94applied the torch\xe2\x80\x94annihilated\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nThe pagan priests were furious. And well they might be; they had held\r\nthe fattest offices in the land, and now they were beggared; they had\r\nbeen great\xe2\x80\x94they had stood above the chiefs\xe2\x80\x94and now they were vagabonds.\r\nThey raised a revolt; they scared a number of people into joining their\r\nstandard, and Bekuokalani, an ambitious offshoot of royalty, was easily\r\npersuaded to become their leader.\r\n\r\nIn the first skirmish the idolaters triumphed over the royal army sent\r\nagainst them, and full of confidence they resolved to march upon Kailua.\r\nThe King sent an envoy to try and conciliate them, and came very near\r\nbeing an envoy short by the operation; the savages not only refused to\r\nlisten to him, but wanted to kill him. So the King sent his men forth\r\nunder Major General Kalaimoku and the two host met a Kuamoo. The battle\r\nwas long and fierce\xe2\x80\x94men and women fighting side by side, as was the\r\ncustom\xe2\x80\x94and when the day was done the rebels were flying in every\r\ndirection in hopeless panic, and idolatry and the _tabu_ were dead in\r\nthe land!\r\n\r\nThe royalists marched gayly home to Kailua glorifying the new\r\ndispensation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no power in the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d said they; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are a\r\nvanity and a lie. The army with idols was weak; the army without idols\r\nwas strong and victorious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe nation was without a religion.\r\n\r\nThe missionary ship arrived in safety shortly afterward, timed by\r\nprovidential exactness to meet the emergency, and the Gospel was planted\r\nas in a virgin soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n523.jpg (57K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt noon, we hired a Kanaka to take us down to the ancient ruins at\r\nHonaunau in his canoe\xe2\x80\x94price two dollars\xe2\x80\x94reasonable enough, for a sea\r\nvoyage of eight miles, counting both ways.\r\n\r\nThe native canoe is an irresponsible looking contrivance. I cannot think\r\nof anything to liken it to but a boy\xe2\x80\x99s sled runner hollowed out, and\r\nthat does not quite convey the correct idea. It is about fifteen feet\r\nlong, high and pointed at both ends, is a foot and a half or two feet\r\ndeep, and so narrow that if you wedged a fat man into it you might not\r\nget him out again. It sits on top of the water like a duck, but it has\r\nan outrigger and does not upset easily, if you keep still. This\r\noutrigger is formed of two long bent sticks like plow handles, which\r\nproject from one side, and to their outer ends is bound a curved beam\r\ncomposed of an extremely light wood, which skims along the surface of\r\nthe water and thus saves you from an upset on that side, while the\r\noutrigger\xe2\x80\x99s weight is not so easily lifted as to make an upset on the\r\nother side a thing to be greatly feared. Still, until one gets used to\r\nsitting perched upon this knifeblade, he is apt to reason within himself\r\nthat it would be more comfortable if there were just an outrigger or so\r\non the other side also. I had the bow seat, and Billings sat amidships\r\nand faced the Kanaka, who occupied the stern of the craft and did the\r\npaddling. With the first stroke the trim shell of a thing shot out from\r\nthe shore like an arrow. There was not much to see. While we were on the\r\nshallow water of the reef, it was pastime to look down into the limpid\r\ndepths at the large bunches of branching coral\xe2\x80\x94the unique shrubbery of\r\nthe sea. We lost that, though, when we got out into the dead blue water\r\nof the deep. But we had the picture of the surf, then, dashing angrily\r\nagainst the crag-bound shore and sending a foaming spray high into the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThere was interest in this beetling border, too, for it was honey-combed\r\nwith quaint caves and arches and tunnels, and had a rude semblance of\r\nthe dilapidated architecture of ruined keeps and castles rising out of\r\nthe restless sea. When this novelty ceased to be a novelty, we turned\r\nour eyes shoreward and gazed at the long mountain with its rich green\r\nforests stretching up into the curtaining clouds, and at the specks of\r\nhouses in the rearward distance and the diminished schooner riding\r\nsleepily at anchor. And when these grew tiresome we dashed boldly into\r\nthe midst of a school of huge, beastly porpoises engaged at their\r\neternal game of arching over a wave and disappearing, and then doing it\r\nover again and keeping it up\xe2\x80\x94always circling over, in that way, like so\r\nmany well-submerged wheels. But the porpoises wheeled themselves away,\r\nand then we were thrown upon our own resources. It did not take many\r\nminutes to discover that the sun was blazing like a bonfire, and that\r\nthe weather was of a melting temperature. It had a drowsing effect, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n525.jpg (87K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both\r\nsexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of\r\nsurf-bathing. Each heathen would paddle three or four hundred yards out\r\nto sea, (taking a short board with him), then face the shore and wait\r\nfor a particularly prodigious billow to come along; at the right moment\r\nhe would fling his board upon its foamy crest and himself upon the\r\nboard, and here he would come whizzing by like a bombshell! It did not\r\nseem that a lightning express train could shoot along at a more hair-\r\nlifting speed. I tried surf-bathing once, subsequently, but made a\r\nfailure of it. I got the board placed right, and at the right moment,\r\ntoo; but missed the connection myself.\xe2\x80\x94The board struck the shore in\r\nthree quarters of a second, without any cargo, and I struck the bottom\r\nabout the same time, with a couple of barrels of water in me. None but\r\nnatives ever master the art of surf-bathing thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n526.jpg (33K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of an hour, we had made the four miles, and landed on a level\r\npoint of land, upon which was a wide extent of old ruins, with many a\r\ntall cocoanut tree growing among them. Here was the ancient City of\r\nRefuge\xe2\x80\x94a vast inclosure, whose stone walls were twenty feet thick at the\r\nbase, and fifteen feet high; an oblong square, a thousand and forty feet\r\none way and a fraction under seven hundred the other. Within this\r\ninclosure, in early times, has been three rude temples; each two hundred\r\nand ten feet long by one hundred wide, and thirteen high.\r\n\r\nIn those days, if a man killed another anywhere on the island the\r\nrelatives were privileged to take the murderer\xe2\x80\x99s life; and then a chase\r\nfor life and liberty began\xe2\x80\x94the outlawed criminal flying through pathless\r\nforests and over mountain and plain, with his hopes fixed upon the\r\nprotecting walls of the City of Refuge, and the avenger of blood\r\nfollowing hotly after him!\r\n\r\nSometimes the race was kept up to the very gates of the temple, and the\r\npanting pair sped through long files of excited natives, who watched the\r\ncontest with flashing eye and dilated nostril, encouraging the hunted\r\nrefugee with sharp, inspiriting ejaculations, and sending up a ringing\r\nshout of exultation when the saving gates closed upon him and the\r\ncheated pursuer sank exhausted at the threshold. But sometimes the\r\nflying criminal fell under the hand of the avenger at the very door,\r\nwhen one more brave stride, one more brief second of time would have\r\nbrought his feet upon the sacred ground and barred him against all harm.\r\nWhere did these isolated pagans get this idea of a City of Refuge\xe2\x80\x94this\r\nancient Oriental custom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n527.jpg (73K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis old sanctuary was sacred to all\xe2\x80\x94even to rebels in arms and invading\r\narmies. Once within its walls, and confession made to the priest and\r\nabsolution obtained, the wretch with a price upon his head could go\r\nforth without fear and without danger\xe2\x80\x94he was _tabu_, and to harm him was\r\ndeath. The routed rebels in the lost battle for idolatry fled to this\r\nplace to claim sanctuary, and many were thus saved.\r\n\r\nClose to the corner of the great inclosure is a round structure of\r\nstone, some six or eight feet high, with a level top about ten or twelve\r\nin diameter. This was the place of execution. A high palisade of\r\ncocoanut piles shut out the cruel scenes from the vulgar multitude. Here\r\ncriminals were killed, the flesh stripped from the bones and burned, and\r\nthe bones secreted in holes in the body of the structure. If the man had\r\nbeen guilty of a high crime, the entire corpse was burned.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the temple are a study. The same food for speculation that\r\nis offered the visitor to the Pyramids of Egypt he will find here\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmystery of how they were constructed by a people unacquainted with\r\nscience and mechanics. The natives have no invention of their own for\r\nhoisting heavy weights, they had no beasts of burden, and they have\r\nnever even shown any knowledge of the properties of the lever. Yet some\r\nof the lava blocks quarried out, brought over rough, broken ground, and\r\nbuilt into this wall, six or seven feet from the ground, are of\r\nprodigious size and would weigh tons. How did they transport and how\r\nraise them?\r\n\r\nBoth the inner and outer surfaces of the walls present a smooth front\r\nand are very creditable specimens of masonry. The blocks are of all\r\nmanner of shapes and sizes, but yet are fitted together with the neatest\r\nexactness. The gradual narrowing of the wall from the base upward is\r\naccurately preserved.\r\n\r\nNo cement was used, but the edifice is firm and compact and is capable\r\nof resisting storm and decay for centuries. Who built this temple, and\r\nhow was it built, and when, are mysteries that may never be unraveled.\r\nOutside of these ancient walls lies a sort of coffin-shaped stone eleven\r\nfeet four inches long and three feet square at the small end (it would\r\nweigh a few thousand pounds), which the high chief who held sway over\r\nthis district many centuries ago brought thither on his shoulder one day\r\nto use as a lounge! This circumstance is established by the most\r\nreliable traditions. He used to lie down on it, in his indolent way, and\r\nkeep an eye on his subjects at work for him and see that there was no\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csoldiering\xe2\x80\x9d done. And no doubt there was not any done to speak of,\r\nbecause he was a man of that sort of build that incites to attention to\r\nbusiness on the part of an employee.\r\n\r\nHe was fourteen or fifteen feet high. When he stretched himself at full\r\nlength on his lounge, his legs hung down over the end, and when he\r\nsnored he woke the dead. These facts are all attested by irrefragable\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n529.jpg (86K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the temple is a monstrous seven-ton rock, eleven\r\nfeet long, seven feet wide and three feet thick. It is raised a foot or\r\na foot and a half above the ground, and rests upon half a dozen little\r\nstony pedestals. The same old fourteen-footer brought it down from the\r\nmountain, merely for fun (he had his own notions about fun), and propped\r\nit up as we find it now and as others may find it a century hence, for\r\nit would take a score of horses to budge it from its position. They say\r\nthat fifty or sixty years ago the proud Queen Kaahumanu used to fly to\r\nthis rock for safety, whenever she had been making trouble with her\r\nfierce husband, and hide under it until his wrath was appeased. But\r\nthese Kanakas will lie, and this statement is one of their ablest\r\nefforts\xe2\x80\x94for Kaahumanu was six feet high\xe2\x80\x94she was bulky\xe2\x80\x94she was built like\r\nan ox\xe2\x80\x94and she could no more have squeezed herself under that rock than\r\nshe could have passed between the cylinders of a sugar mill. What could\r\nshe gain by it, even if she succeeded? To be chased and abused by a\r\nsavage husband could not be otherwise than humiliating to her high\r\nspirit, yet it could never make her feel so flat as an hour\xe2\x80\x99s repose\r\nunder that rock would.\r\n\r\nWe walked a mile over a raised macadamized road of uniform width; a road\r\npaved with flat stones and exhibiting in its every detail a considerable\r\ndegree of engineering skill. Some say that that wise old pagan,\r\nKamehameha I planned and built it, but others say it was built so long\r\nbefore his time that the knowledge of who constructed it has passed out\r\nof the traditions. In either case, however, as the handiwork of an\r\nuntaught and degraded race it is a thing of pleasing interest. The\r\nstones are worn and smooth, and pushed apart in places, so that the road\r\nhas the exact appearance of those ancient paved highways leading out of\r\nRome which one sees in pictures.\r\n\r\nThe object of our tramp was to visit a great natural curiosity at the\r\nbase of the foothills\xe2\x80\x94a congealed cascade of lava. Some old forgotten\r\nvolcanic eruption sent its broad river of fire down the mountain side\r\nhere, and it poured down in a great torrent from an overhanging bluff\r\nsome fifty feet high to the ground below. The flaming torrent cooled in\r\nthe winds from the sea, and remains there to-day, all seamed, and\r\nfrothed and rippled a petrified Niagara. It is very picturesque, and\r\nwithal so natural that one might almost imagine it still flowed. A\r\nsmaller stream trickled over the cliff and built up an isolated pyramid\r\nabout thirty feet high, which has the semblance of a mass of large\r\ngnarled and knotted vines and roots and stems intricately twisted and\r\nwoven together.\r\n\r\nWe passed in behind the cascade and the pyramid, and found the bluff\r\npierced by several cavernous tunnels, whose crooked courses we followed\r\na long distance.\r\n\r\nTwo of these winding tunnels stand as proof of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s mining\r\nabilities. Their floors are level, they are seven feet wide, and their\r\nroofs are gently arched. Their height is not uniform, however. We passed\r\nthrough one a hundred feet long, which leads through a spur of the hill\r\nand opens out well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose foot rests\r\nin the waves of the sea. It is a commodious tunnel, except that there\r\nare occasional places in it where one must stoop to pass under. The roof\r\nis lava, of course, and is thickly studded with little lava-pointed\r\nicicles an inch long, which hardened as they dripped. They project as\r\nclosely together as the iron teeth of a corn-sheller, and if one will\r\nstand up straight and walk any distance there, he can get his hair\r\ncombed free of charge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n531.jpg (55K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe got back to the schooner in good time, and then sailed down to Kau,\r\nwhere we disembarked and took final leave of the vessel. Next day we\r\nbought horses and bent our way over the summer-clad mountain-terraces,\r\ntoward the great volcano of Kilauea (Ke-low-way-ah). We made nearly a\r\ntwo days\xe2\x80\x99 journey of it, but that was on account of laziness. Toward\r\nsunset on the second day, we reached an elevation of some four thousand\r\nfeet above sea level, and as we picked our careful way through billowy\r\nwastes of lava long generations ago stricken dead and cold in the climax\r\nof its tossing fury, we began to come upon signs of the near presence of\r\nthe volcano\xe2\x80\x94signs in the nature of ragged fissures that discharged jets\r\nof sulphurous vapor into the air, hot from the molten ocean down in the\r\nbowels of the mountain.\r\n\r\nShortly the crater came into view. I have seen Vesuvius since, but it\r\nwas a mere toy, a child\xe2\x80\x99s volcano, a soup-kettle, compared to this.\r\nMount Vesuvius is a shapely cone thirty-six hundred feet high; its\r\ncrater an inverted cone only three hundred feet deep, and not more than\r\na thousand feet in diameter, if as much as that; its fires meagre,\r\nmodest, and docile.\xe2\x80\x94But here was a vast, perpendicular, walled cellar,\r\nnine hundred feet deep in some places, thirteen hundred in others,\r\nlevel- floored, and _ten miles in circumference_! Here was a yawning pit\r\nupon whose floor the armies of Russia could camp, and have room to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\nPerched upon the edge of the crater, at the opposite end from where we\r\nstood, was a small look-out house\xe2\x80\x94say three miles away. It assisted us,\r\nby comparison, to comprehend and appreciate the great depth of the\r\nbasin\xe2\x80\x94it looked like a tiny martin-box clinging at the eaves of a\r\ncathedral. After some little time spent in resting and looking and\r\nciphering, we hurried on to the hotel.\r\n\r\nBy the path it is half a mile from the Volcano House to the lookout-\r\nhouse. After a hearty supper we waited until it was thoroughly dark and\r\nthen started to the crater. The first glance in that direction revealed\r\na scene of wild beauty. There was a heavy fog over the crater and it was\r\nsplendidly illuminated by the glare from the fires below. The\r\nillumination was two miles wide and a mile high, perhaps; and if you\r\never, on a dark night and at a distance beheld the light from thirty or\r\nforty blocks of distant buildings all on fire at once, reflected\r\nstrongly against over-hanging clouds, you can form a fair idea of what\r\nthis looked like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n533.jpg (37K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA colossal column of cloud towered to a great height in the air\r\nimmediately above the crater, and the outer swell of every one of its\r\nvast folds was dyed with a rich crimson luster, which was subdued to a\r\npale rose tint in the depressions between. It glowed like a muffled\r\ntorch and stretched upward to a dizzy height toward the zenith. I\r\nthought it just possible that its like had not been seen since the\r\nchildren of Israel wandered on their long march through the desert so\r\nmany centuries ago over a path illuminated by the mysterious \xe2\x80\x9cpillar of\r\nfire.\xe2\x80\x9d And I was sure that I now had a vivid conception of what the\r\nmajestic \xe2\x80\x9cpillar of fire\xe2\x80\x9d was like, which almost amounted to a\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\nArrived at the little thatched lookout house, we rested our elbows on\r\nthe railing in front and looked abroad over the wide crater and down\r\nover the sheer precipice at the seething fires beneath us. The view was\r\na startling improvement on my daylight experience. I turned to see the\r\neffect on the balance of the company and found the reddest-faced set of\r\nmen I almost ever saw. In the strong light every countenance glowed like\r\nred-hot iron, every shoulder was suffused with crimson and shaded\r\nrearward into dingy, shapeless obscurity! The place below looked like\r\nthe infernal regions and these men like half-cooled devils just come up\r\non a furlough.\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes upon the volcano again. The \xe2\x80\x9ccellar\xe2\x80\x9d was tolerably well\r\nlighted up. For a mile and a half in front of us and half a mile on\r\neither side, the floor of the abyss was magnificently illuminated;\r\nbeyond these limits the mists hung down their gauzy curtains and cast a\r\ndeceptive gloom over all that made the twinkling fires in the remote\r\ncorners of the crater seem countless leagues removed\xe2\x80\x94made them seem like\r\nthe camp-fires of a great army far away. Here was room for the\r\nimagination to work! You could imagine those lights the width of a\r\ncontinent away\xe2\x80\x94and that hidden under the intervening darkness were\r\nhills, and winding rivers, and weary wastes of plain and desert\xe2\x80\x94and even\r\nthen the tremendous vista stretched on, and on, and on!\xe2\x80\x94to the fires and\r\nfar beyond! You could not compass it\xe2\x80\x94it was the idea of eternity made\r\ntangible\xe2\x80\x94and the longest end of it made visible to the naked eye!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n535.jpg (125K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the vast floor of the desert under us was as black\r\nas ink, and apparently smooth and level; but over a mile square of it\r\nwas ringed and streaked and striped with a thousand branching streams of\r\nliquid and gorgeously brilliant fire! It looked like a colossal railroad\r\nmap of the State of Massachusetts done in chain lightning on a midnight\r\nsky. Imagine it\xe2\x80\x94imagine a coal-black sky shivered into a tangled net-\r\nwork of angry fire!\r\n\r\nHere and there were gleaming holes a hundred feet in diameter, broken in\r\nthe dark crust, and in them the melted lava\xe2\x80\x94the color a dazzling white\r\njust tinged with yellow\xe2\x80\x94was boiling and surging furiously; and from\r\nthese holes branched numberless bright torrents in many directions, like\r\nthe spokes of a wheel, and kept a tolerably straight course for a while\r\nand then swept round in huge rainbow curves, or made a long succession\r\nof sharp worm-fence angles, which looked precisely like the fiercest\r\njagged lightning. These streams met other streams, and they mingled with\r\nand crossed and recrossed each other in every conceivable direction,\r\nlike skate tracks on a popular skating ground. Sometimes streams twenty\r\nor thirty feet wide flowed from the holes to some distance without\r\ndividing\xe2\x80\x94and through the opera-glasses we could see that they ran down\r\nsmall, steep hills and were genuine cataracts of fire, white at their\r\nsource, but soon cooling and turning to the richest red, grained with\r\nalternate lines of black and gold. Every now and then masses of the dark\r\ncrust broke away and floated slowly down these streams like rafts down a\r\nriver. Occasionally the molten lava flowing under the superincumbent\r\ncrust broke through\xe2\x80\x94split a dazzling streak, from five hundred to a\r\nthousand feet long, like a sudden flash of lightning, and then acre\r\nafter acre of the cold lava parted into fragments, turned up edgewise\r\nlike cakes of ice when a great river breaks up, plunged downward and\r\nwere swallowed in the crimson cauldron. Then the wide expanse of the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthaw\xe2\x80\x9d maintained a ruddy glow for a while, but shortly cooled and\r\nbecame black and level again. During a \xe2\x80\x9cthaw,\xe2\x80\x9d every dismembered cake\r\nwas marked by a glittering white border which was superbly shaded inward\r\nby aurora borealis rays, which were a flaming yellow where they joined\r\nthe white border, and from thence toward their points tapered into\r\nglowing crimson, then into a rich, pale carmine, and finally into a\r\nfaint blush that held its own a moment and then dimmed and turned black.\r\nSome of the streams preferred to mingle together in a tangle of\r\nfantastic circles, and then they looked something like the confusion of\r\nropes one sees on a ship\xe2\x80\x99s deck when she has just taken in sail and\r\ndropped anchor\xe2\x80\x94provided one can imagine those ropes on fire.\r\n\r\nThrough the glasses, the little fountains scattered about looked very\r\nbeautiful. They boiled, and coughed, and spluttered, and discharged\r\nsprays of stringy red fire\xe2\x80\x94of about the consistency of mush, for\r\ninstance\xe2\x80\x94from ten to fifteen feet into the air, along with a shower of\r\nbrilliant white sparks\xe2\x80\x94a quaint and unnatural mingling of gouts of blood\r\nand snow-flakes!\r\n\r\nWe had circles and serpents and streaks of lightning all twined and\r\nwreathed and tied together, without a break throughout an area more than\r\na mile square (that amount of ground was covered, though it was not\r\nstrictly \xe2\x80\x9csquare\xe2\x80\x9d), and it was with a feeling of placid exultation that\r\nwe reflected that many years had elapsed since any visitor had seen such\r\na splendid display\xe2\x80\x94since any visitor had seen anything more than the now\r\nsnubbed and insignificant \xe2\x80\x9cNorth\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSouth\xe2\x80\x9d lakes in action. We had\r\nbeen reading old files of Hawaiian newspapers and the \xe2\x80\x9cRecord Book\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nthe Volcano House, and were posted.\r\n\r\nI could see the North Lake lying out on the black floor away off in the\r\nouter edge of our panorama, and knitted to it by a web-work of lava\r\nstreams. In its individual capacity it looked very little more\r\nrespectable than a schoolhouse on fire. True, it was about nine hundred\r\nfeet long and two or three hundred wide, but then, under the present\r\ncircumstances, it necessarily appeared rather insignificant, and besides\r\nit was so distant from us.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that the noise made by the bubbling lava is not great,\r\nheard as we heard it from our lofty perch. It makes three distinct\r\nsounds\xe2\x80\x94a rushing, a hissing, and a coughing or puffing sound; and if you\r\nstand on the brink and close your eyes it is no trick at all to imagine\r\nthat you are sweeping down a river on a large low-pressure steamer, and\r\nthat you hear the hissing of the steam about her boilers, the puffing\r\nfrom her escape-pipes and the churning rush of the water abaft her\r\nwheels. The smell of sulphur is strong, but not unpleasant to a sinner.\r\n\r\nWe left the lookout house at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in a half cooked condition,\r\nbecause of the heat from Pele\xe2\x80\x99s furnaces, and wrapping up in blankets,\r\nfor the night was cold, we returned to our Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next night was appointed for a visit to the bottom of the crater,\r\nfor we desired to traverse its floor and see the \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Lake\xe2\x80\x9d (of fire)\r\nwhich lay two miles away, toward the further wall. After dark half a\r\ndozen of us set out, with lanterns and native guides, and climbed down a\r\ncrazy, thousand-foot pathway in a crevice fractured in the crater wall,\r\nand reached the bottom in safety.\r\n\r\nThe irruption of the previous evening had spent its force and the floor\r\nlooked black and cold; but when we ran out upon it we found it hot yet,\r\nto the feet, and it was likewise riven with crevices which revealed the\r\nunderlying fires gleaming vindictively. A neighboring cauldron was\r\nthreatening to overflow, and this added to the dubiousness of the\r\nsituation. So the native guides refused to continue the venture, and\r\nthen every body deserted except a stranger named Marlette. He said he\r\nhad been in the crater a dozen times in daylight and believed he could\r\nfind his way through it at night. He thought that a run of three hundred\r\nyards would carry us over the hottest part of the floor and leave us our\r\nshoe-soles. His pluck gave me back-bone. We took one lantern and\r\ninstructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the look-out\r\nhouse to serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost, and then the\r\nparty started back up the precipice and Marlette and I made our run. We\r\nskipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk dispatch\r\nand reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet. Then we took\r\nthings leisurely and comfortably, jumping tolerably wide and probably\r\nbottomless chasms, and threading our way through picturesque lava\r\nupheavals with considerable confidence. When we got fairly away from the\r\ncauldrons of boiling fire, we seemed to be in a gloomy desert, and a\r\nsuffocatingly dark one, surrounded by dim walls that seemed to tower to\r\nthe sky. The only cheerful objects were the glinting stars high\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nBy and by Marlette shouted \xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d I never stopped quicker in my life. I\r\nasked what the matter was. He said we were out of the path. He said we\r\nmust not try to go on till we found it again, for we were surrounded\r\nwith beds of rotten lava through which we could easily break and plunge\r\ndown a thousand feet. I thought eight hundred would answer for me, and\r\nwas about to say so when Marlette partly proved his statement by\r\naccidentally crushing through and disappearing to his arm-pits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n539.jpg (43K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe got out and we hunted for the path with the lantern. He said there\r\nwas only one path and that it was but vaguely defined. We could not find\r\nit. The lava surface was all alike in the lantern light. But he was an\r\ningenious man. He said it was not the lantern that had informed him that\r\nwe were out of the path, but his _feet_. He had noticed a crisp grinding\r\nof fine lava-needles under his feet, and some instinct reminded him that\r\nin the path these were all worn away. So he put the lantern behind him,\r\nand began to search with his boots instead of his eyes. It was good\r\nsagacity. The first time his foot touched a surface that did not grind\r\nunder it he announced that the trail was found again; and after that we\r\nkept up a sharp listening for the rasping sound and it always warned us\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nIt was a long tramp, but an exciting one. We reached the North Lake\r\nbetween ten and eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and sat down on a huge overhanging lava-\r\nshelf, tired but satisfied. The spectacle presented was worth coming\r\ndouble the distance to see. Under us, and stretching away before us, was\r\na heaving sea of molten fire of seemingly limitless extent. The glare\r\nfrom it was so blinding that it was some time before we could bear to\r\nlook upon it steadily.\r\n\r\nIt was like gazing at the sun at noon-day, except that the glare was not\r\nquite so white. At unequal distances all around the shores of the lake\r\nwere nearly white-hot chimneys or hollow drums of lava, four or five\r\nfeet high, and up through them were bursting gorgeous sprays of lava-\r\ngouts and gem spangles, some white, some red and some golden\xe2\x80\x94a ceaseless\r\nbombardment, and one that fascinated the eye with its unapproachable\r\nsplendor. The mere distant jets, sparkling up through an intervening\r\ngossamer veil of vapor, seemed miles away; and the further the curving\r\nranks of fiery fountains receded, the more fairy-like and beautiful they\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n540.jpg (78K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow and then the surging bosom of the lake under our noses would calm\r\ndown ominously and seem to be gathering strength for an enterprise; and\r\nthen all of a sudden a red dome of lava of the bulk of an ordinary\r\ndwelling would heave itself aloft like an escaping balloon, then burst\r\nasunder, and out of its heart would flit a pale-green film of vapor, and\r\nfloat upward and vanish in the darkness\xe2\x80\x94a released soul soaring homeward\r\nfrom captivity with the damned, no doubt. The crashing plunge of the\r\nruined dome into the lake again would send a world of seething billows\r\nlashing against the shores and shaking the foundations of our perch. By\r\nand by, a loosened mass of the hanging shelf we sat on tumbled into the\r\nlake, jarring the surroundings like an earthquake and delivering a\r\nsuggestion that may have been intended for a hint, and may not. We did\r\nnot wait to see.\r\n\r\nWe got lost again on our way back, and were more than an hour hunting\r\nfor the path. We were where we could see the beacon lantern at the look-\r\nout house at the time, but thought it was a star and paid no attention\r\nto it. We reached the hotel at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning pretty well\r\nfagged out.\r\n\r\nKilauea never overflows its vast crater, but bursts a passage for its\r\nlava through the mountain side when relief is necessary, and then the\r\ndestruction is fearful. About 1840 it rent its overburdened stomach and\r\nsent a broad river of fire careering down to the sea, which swept away\r\nforests, huts, plantations and every thing else that lay in its path.\r\nThe stream was _five miles broad_, in places, and _two hundred feet\r\ndeep_, and the distance it traveled was forty miles. It tore up and bore\r\naway acre-patches of land on its bosom like rafts\xe2\x80\x94rocks, trees and all\r\nintact. At night the red glare was visible a hundred miles at sea; and\r\nat a distance of forty miles fine print could be read at midnight. The\r\natmosphere was poisoned with sulphurous vapors and choked with falling\r\nashes, pumice stones and cinders; countless columns of smoke rose up and\r\nblended together in a tumbled canopy that hid the heavens and glowed\r\nwith a ruddy flush reflected from the fires below; here and there jets\r\nof lava sprung hundreds of feet into the air and burst into rocket-\r\nsprays that returned to earth in a crimson rain; and all the while the\r\nlaboring mountain shook with Nature\xe2\x80\x99s great palsy and voiced its\r\ndistress in moanings and the muffled booming of subterranean thunders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n542.jpg (103K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFishes were killed for twenty miles along the shore, where the lava\r\nentered the sea. The earthquakes caused some loss of human life, and a\r\nprodigious tidal wave swept inland, carrying every thing before it and\r\ndrowning a number of natives. The devastation consummated along the\r\nroute traversed by the river of lava was complete and incalculable. Only\r\na Pompeii and a Herculaneum were needed at the foot of Kilauea to make\r\nthe story of the irruption immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n543.jpg (113K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rode horseback all around the island of Hawaii (the crooked road\r\nmaking the distance two hundred miles), and enjoyed the journey very\r\nmuch. We were more than a week making the trip, because our Kanaka\r\nhorses would not go by a house or a hut without stopping\xe2\x80\x94whip and spur\r\ncould not alter their minds about it, and so we finally found that it\r\neconomized time to let them have their way. Upon inquiry the mystery was\r\nexplained: the natives are such thorough-going gossips that they never\r\npass a house without stopping to swap news, and consequently their\r\nhorses learn to regard that sort of thing as an essential part of the\r\nwhole duty of man, and his salvation not to be compassed without it.\r\nHowever, at a former crisis of my life I had once taken an aristocratic\r\nyoung lady out driving, behind a horse that had just retired from a long\r\nand honorable career as the moving impulse of a milk wagon, and so this\r\npresent experience awoke a reminiscent sadness in me in place of the\r\nexasperation more natural to the occasion. I remembered how helpless I\r\nwas that day, and how humiliated; how ashamed I was of having intimated\r\nto the girl that I had always owned the horse and was accustomed to\r\ngrandeur; how hard I tried to appear easy, and even vivacious, under\r\nsuffering that was consuming my vitals; how placidly and maliciously the\r\ngirl smiled, and kept on smiling, while my hot blushes baked themselves\r\ninto a permanent blood-pudding in my face; how the horse ambled from one\r\nside of the street to the other and waited complacently before every\r\nthird house two minutes and a quarter while I belabored his back and\r\nreviled him in my heart; how I tried to keep him from turning corners\r\nand failed; how I moved heaven and earth to get him out of town, and did\r\nnot succeed; how he traversed the entire settlement and delivered\r\nimaginary milk at a hundred and sixty-two different domiciles, and how\r\nhe finally brought up at a dairy depot and refused to budge further,\r\nthus rounding and completing the revealment of what the plebeian service\r\nof his life had been; how, in eloquent silence, I walked the girl home,\r\nand how, when I took leave of her, her parting remark scorched my soul\r\nand appeared to blister me all over: she said that my horse was a fine,\r\ncapable animal, and I must have taken great comfort in him in my\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94but that if I would take along some milk-tickets next time, and\r\nappear to deliver them at the various halting places, it might expedite\r\nhis movements a little. There was a coolness between us after that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n545.jpg (90K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one place in the island of Hawaii, we saw a laced and ruffled\r\ncataract of limpid water leaping from a sheer precipice fifteen hundred\r\nfeet high; but that sort of scenery finds its stanchest ally in the\r\narithmetic rather than in spectacular effect. If one desires to be so\r\nstirred by a poem of Nature wrought in the happily commingled graces of\r\npicturesque rocks, glimpsed distances, foliage, color, shifting lights\r\nand shadows, and failing water, that the tears almost come into his eyes\r\nso potent is the charm exerted, he need not go away from America to\r\nenjoy such an experience. The Rainbow Fall, in Watkins Glen (N.Y.), on\r\nthe Erie railway, is an example. It would recede into pitiable\r\ninsignificance if the callous tourist drew on arithmetic on it; but left\r\nto compete for the honors simply on scenic grace and beauty\xe2\x80\x94the grand,\r\nthe august and the sublime being barred the contest\xe2\x80\x94it could challenge\r\nthe old world and the new to produce its peer.\r\n\r\nIn one locality, on our journey, we saw some horses that had been born\r\nand reared on top of the mountains, above the range of running water,\r\nand consequently they had never drank that fluid in their lives, but had\r\nbeen always accustomed to quenching their thirst by eating dew-laden or\r\nshower-wetted leaves. And now it was destructively funny to see them\r\nsniff suspiciously at a pail of water, and then put in their noses and\r\ntry to take a _bite_ out of the fluid, as if it were a solid. Finding it\r\nliquid, they would snatch away their heads and fall to trembling,\r\nsnorting and showing other evidences of fright. When they became\r\nconvinced at last that the water was friendly and harmless, they thrust\r\nin their noses up to their eyes, brought out a mouthful of water, and\r\nproceeded to _chew_ it complacently. We saw a man coax, kick and spur\r\none of them five or ten minutes before he could make it cross a running\r\nstream. It spread its nostrils, distended its eyes and trembled all\r\nover, just as horses customarily do in the presence of a serpent\xe2\x80\x94and for\r\naught I know it thought the crawling stream _was_ a serpent.\r\n\r\nIn due course of time our journey came to an end at Kawaehae (usually\r\npronounced To-a-_hi_\xe2\x80\x94and before we find fault with this elaborate\r\northographical method of arriving at such an unostentatious result, let\r\nus lop off the _ugh_ from our word \xe2\x80\x9cthough\xe2\x80\x9d). I made this horseback trip\r\non a mule. I paid ten dollars for him at Kau (Kah-oo), added four to get\r\nhim shod, rode him two hundred miles, and then sold him for fifteen\r\ndollars. I mark the circumstance with a white stone (in the absence of\r\nchalk\xe2\x80\x94for I never saw a white stone that a body could mark anything\r\nwith, though out of respect for the ancients I have tried it often\r\nenough); for up to that day and date it was the first strictly\r\ncommercial transaction I had ever entered into, and come out winner. We\r\nreturned to Honolulu, and from thence sailed to the island of Maui, and\r\nspent several weeks there very pleasantly. I still remember, with a\r\nsense of indolent luxury, a picnicing excursion up a romantic gorge\r\nthere, called the Iao Valley. The trail lay along the edge of a brawling\r\nstream in the bottom of the gorge\xe2\x80\x94a shady route, for it was well roofed\r\nwith the verdant domes of forest trees. Through openings in the foliage\r\nwe glimpsed picturesque scenery that revealed ceaseless changes and new\r\ncharms with every step of our progress. Perpendicular walls from one to\r\nthree thousand feet high guarded the way, and were sumptuously plumed\r\nwith varied foliage, in places, and in places swathed in waving ferns.\r\nPassing shreds of cloud trailed their shadows across these shining\r\nfronts, mottling them with blots; billowy masses of white vapor hid the\r\nturreted summits, and far above the vapor swelled a background of\r\ngleaming green crags and cones that came and went, through the veiling\r\nmists, like islands drifting in a fog; sometimes the cloudy curtain\r\ndescended till half the ca\xc3\xb1on wall was hidden, then shredded gradually\r\naway till only airy glimpses of the ferny front appeared through it\xe2\x80\x94then\r\nswept aloft and left it glorified in the sun again. Now and then, as our\r\nposition changed, rocky bastions swung out from the wall, a mimic ruin\r\nof castellated ramparts and crumbling towers clothed with mosses and\r\nhung with garlands of swaying vines, and as we moved on they swung back\r\nagain and hid themselves once more in the foliage. Presently a verdure-\r\nclad needle of stone, a thousand feet high, stepped out from behind a\r\ncorner, and mounted guard over the mysteries of the valley. It seemed to\r\nme that if Captain Cook needed a monument, here was one ready\r\nmade\xe2\x80\x94therefore, why not put up his sign here, and sell out the venerable\r\ncocoanut stump?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n547.jpg (192K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the chief pride of Maui is her dead volcano of Haleakala\xe2\x80\x94which\r\nmeans, translated, \xe2\x80\x9cthe house of the sun.\xe2\x80\x9d We climbed a thousand feet up\r\nthe side of this isolated colossus one afternoon; then camped, and next\r\nday climbed the remaining nine thousand feet, and anchored on the\r\nsummit, where we built a fire and froze and roasted by turns, all night.\r\nWith the first pallor of dawn we got up and saw things that were new to\r\nus. Mounted on a commanding pinnacle, we watched Nature work her silent\r\nwonders. The sea was spread abroad on every hand, its tumbled surface\r\nseeming only wrinkled and dimpled in the distance. A broad valley below\r\nappeared like an ample checker-board, its velvety green sugar\r\nplantations alternating with dun squares of barrenness and groves of\r\ntrees diminished to mossy tufts. Beyond the valley were mountains\r\npicturesquely grouped together; but bear in mind, we fancied that we\r\nwere looking _up_ at these things\xe2\x80\x94not down. We seemed to sit in the\r\nbottom of a symmetrical bowl ten thousand feet deep, with the valley and\r\nthe skirting sea lifted away into the sky above us! It was curious; and\r\nnot only curious, but aggravating; for it was having our trouble all for\r\nnothing, to climb ten thousand feet toward heaven and then have to look\r\n_up_ at our scenery. However, we had to be content with it and make the\r\nbest of it; for, all we could do we could not coax our landscape down\r\nout of the clouds. Formerly, when I had read an article in which Poe\r\ntreated of this singular fraud perpetrated upon the eye by isolated\r\ngreat altitudes, I had looked upon the matter as an invention of his own\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the outside view\xe2\x80\x94but we had an inside one, too. That\r\nwas the yawning dead crater, into which we now and then tumbled rocks,\r\nhalf as large as a barrel, from our perch, and saw them go careering\r\ndown the almost perpendicular sides, bounding three hundred feet at a\r\njump; kicking up cast-clouds wherever they struck; diminishing to our\r\nview as they sped farther into distance; growing invisible, finally, and\r\nonly betraying their course by faint little puffs of dust; and coming to\r\na halt at last in the bottom of the abyss, two thousand five hundred\r\nfeet down from where they started! It was magnificent sport. We wore\r\nourselves out at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n549.jpg (138K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crater of Vesuvius, as I have before remarked, is a modest pit about\r\na thousand feet deep and three thousand in circumference; that of\r\nKilauea is somewhat deeper, and _ten miles_ in circumference. But what\r\nare either of them compared to the vacant stomach of Haleakala? I will\r\nnot offer any figures of my own, but give official ones\xe2\x80\x94those of\r\nCommander Wilkes, U.S.N., who surveyed it and testifies that it is\r\n_twenty-seven miles in circumference_! If it had a level bottom it would\r\nmake a fine site for a city like London. It must have afforded a\r\nspectacle worth contemplating in the old days when its furnaces gave\r\nfull rein to their anger.\r\n\r\nPresently vagrant white clouds came drifting along, high over the sea\r\nand the valley; then they came in couples and groups; then in imposing\r\nsquadrons; gradually joining their forces, they banked themselves\r\nsolidly together, a thousand feet under us, and _totally shut out land\r\nand ocean_\xe2\x80\x94not a vestige of _anything_ was left in view but just a\r\nlittle of the rim of the crater, circling away from the pinnacle whereon\r\nwe sat (for a ghostly procession of wanderers from the filmy hosts\r\nwithout had drifted through a chasm in the crater wall and filed round\r\nand round, and gathered and sunk and blended together till the abyss was\r\nstored to the brim with a fleecy fog). Thus banked, motion ceased, and\r\nsilence reigned. Clear to the horizon, league on league, the snowy floor\r\nstretched without a break\xe2\x80\x94not level, but in rounded folds, with shallow\r\ncreases between, and with here and there stately piles of vapory\r\narchitecture lifting themselves aloft out of the common plain\xe2\x80\x94some near\r\nat hand, some in the middle distances, and others relieving the monotony\r\nof the remote solitudes. There was little conversation, for the\r\nimpressive scene overawed speech. I felt like the Last Man, neglected of\r\nthe judgment, and left pinnacled in mid-heaven, a forgotten relic of a\r\nvanished world.\r\n\r\nWhile the hush yet brooded, the messengers of the coming resurrection\r\nappeared in the East. A growing warmth suffused the horizon, and soon\r\nthe sun emerged and looked out over the cloud-waste, flinging bars of\r\nruddy light across it, staining its folds and billow-caps with blushes,\r\npurpling the shaded troughs between, and glorifying the massy vapor-\r\npalaces and cathedrals with a wasteful splendor of all blendings and\r\ncombinations of rich coloring.\r\n\r\nIt was the sublimest spectacle I ever witnessed, and I think the memory\r\nof it will remain with me always.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon one curious character in the Island of Maui. He became a\r\nsore annoyance to me in the course of time. My first glimpse of him was\r\nin a sort of public room in the town of Lahaina. He occupied a chair at\r\nthe opposite side of the apartment, and sat eyeing our party with\r\ninterest for some minutes, and listening as critically to what we were\r\nsaying as if he fancied we were talking to him and expecting him to\r\nreply. I thought it very sociable in a stranger. Presently, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, I made a statement bearing upon the subject\r\nunder discussion\xe2\x80\x94and I made it with due modesty, for there was nothing\r\nextraordinary about it, and it was only put forth in illustration of a\r\npoint at issue. I had barely finished when this person spoke out with\r\nrapid utterance and feverish anxiety:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, that was certainly remarkable, after a fashion, but you ought to\r\nhave seen _my_ chimney\xe2\x80\x94you ought to have seen _my_ chimney, sir! Smoke!\r\nI wish I may hang if\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Jones, _you_ remember that chimney\xe2\x80\x94_you_ must\r\nremember that chimney! No, no\xe2\x80\x94I recollect, now, you warn\xe2\x80\x99t living on\r\nthis side of the island then. But I am telling you nothing but the\r\ntruth, and I wish I may never draw another breath if that chimney didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsmoke so that the smoke actually got _caked_ in it and I had to dig it\r\nout with a pickaxe! You may smile, gentlemen, but the High Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s got\r\na hunk of it which I dug out before his eyes, and so it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly easy\r\nfor you to go and examine for yourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe interruption broke up the conversation, which had already begun to\r\nlag, and we presently hired some natives and an out-rigger canoe or two,\r\nand went out to overlook a grand surf-bathing contest.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after this, while talking in a company, I looked up and\r\ndetected this same man boring through and through me with his intense\r\neye, and noted again his twitching muscles and his feverish anxiety to\r\nspeak. The moment I paused, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Beg_ your pardon, sir, beg your pardon, but it can only be considered\r\nremarkable when brought into strong outline by isolation. Sir,\r\ncontrasted with a circumstance which occurred in my own experience, it\r\ninstantly becomes commonplace. No, not that\xe2\x80\x94for I will not speak so\r\ndiscourteously of any experience in the career of a stranger and a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x94but I am _obliged_ to say that you could not, and you _would_\r\nnot ever again refer to this tree as a _large_ one, if you could behold,\r\nas I have, the great Yakmatack tree, in the island of Ounaska, sea of\r\nKamtchatka\xe2\x80\x94a tree, sir, not one inch less than four hundred and fifteen\r\nfeet in solid diameter!\xe2\x80\x94and I wish I may die in a minute if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t so!\r\nOh, you needn\xe2\x80\x99t look so questioning, gentlemen; here\xe2\x80\x99s old Cap Saltmarsh\r\ncan say whether I know what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about or not. I showed him the\r\ntree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n_Captain Saltmarsh_.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, cat your anchor, lad\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re heaving too\r\ntaut. You _promised_ to show me that stunner, and I walked more than\r\neleven mile with you through the cussedest jungle _I_ ever see, a\r\nhunting for it; but the tree you showed me finally warn\xe2\x80\x99t as big around\r\nas a beer cask, and _you_ know that your own self, Markiss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n553.jpg (48K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear the man talk! Of _course_ the tree was reduced that way, but\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t I _explain_ it? Answer me, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I say I wished you\r\ncould have seen it when _I_ first saw it? When you got up on your ear\r\nand called me names, and said I had brought you eleven miles to look at\r\na sapling, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I _explain_ to you that all the whale-ships in the\r\nNorth Seas had been wooding off of it for more than twenty-seven years?\r\nAnd did you s\xe2\x80\x99pose the tree could last for-_ever_, con-_found_ it? I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t see why you want to keep back things that way, and try to injure a\r\nperson that\xe2\x80\x99s never done _you_ any harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow this man\xe2\x80\x99s presence made me uncomfortable, and I was glad when a\r\nnative arrived at that moment to say that Muckawow, the most\r\ncompanionable and luxurious among the rude war-chiefs of the Islands,\r\ndesired us to come over and help him enjoy a missionary whom he had\r\nfound trespassing on his grounds.\r\n\r\nI think it was about ten days afterward that, as I finished a statement\r\nI was making for the instruction of a group of friends and\r\nacquaintances, and which made no pretence of being extraordinary, a\r\nfamiliar voice chimed instantly in on the heels of my last word, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, my dear sir, there was _nothing_ remarkable about that horse, or\r\nthe circumstance either\xe2\x80\x94nothing in the world! I mean no sort of offence\r\nwhen I say it, sir, but you really do not know anything whatever about\r\nspeed. Bless your heart, if you could only have seen my mare Margaretta;\r\n_there_ was a beast!\xe2\x80\x94_there_ was lightning for you! Trot! Trot is no\r\nname for it\xe2\x80\x94she flew! How she could whirl a buggy along! I started her\r\nout once, sir\xe2\x80\x94Colonel Bilgewater, _you_ recollect that animal perfectly\r\nwell\xe2\x80\x94I started her out about thirty or thirty-five yards ahead of the\r\nawfullest storm I ever saw in my life, and it chased us upwards of\r\neighteen miles! It did, by the everlasting hills! And I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you\r\nnothing but the unvarnished truth when I say that not one single _drop_\r\nof rain fell on me\xe2\x80\x94not a single drop, sir! And I swear to it! But my dog\r\nwas a-swimming behind the wagon all the way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n554.jpg (76K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a week or two I stayed mostly within doors, for I seemed to meet\r\nthis person everywhere, and he had become utterly hateful to me. But one\r\nevening I dropped in on Captain Perkins and his friends, and we had a\r\nsociable time. About ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock I chanced to be talking about a\r\nmerchant friend of mine, and without really intending it, the remark\r\nslipped out that he was a little mean and parsimonious about paying his\r\nworkmen. Instantly, through the steam of a hot whiskey punch on the\r\nopposite side of the room, a remembered voice shot\xe2\x80\x94and for a moment I\r\ntrembled on the imminent verge of profanity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my dear sir, really you expose yourself when you parade _that_ as a\r\nsurprising circumstance. Bless your heart and hide, you are ignorant of\r\nthe very A B C of meanness! ignorant as the unborn babe! ignorant as\r\nunborn _twins_! You don\xe2\x80\x99t know _anything_ about it! It is pitiable to\r\nsee you, sir, a well-spoken and prepossessing stranger, making such an\r\nenormous pow-wow here about a subject concerning which your ignorance is\r\nperfectly humiliating! Look me in the eye, if you please; look me in the\r\neye. John James Godfrey was the son of poor but honest parents in the\r\nState of Mississippi\xe2\x80\x94boyhood friend of mine\xe2\x80\x94bosom comrade in later\r\nyears. Heaven rest his noble spirit, he is gone from us now. John James\r\nGodfrey was hired by the Hayblossom Mining Company in California to do\r\nsome blasting for them\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cIncorporated Company of Mean Men,\xe2\x80\x9d the boys\r\nused to call it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, one day he drilled a hole about four feet deep and put in an\r\nawful blast of powder, and was standing over it ramming it down with an\r\niron crowbar about nine foot long, when the cussed thing struck a spark\r\nand fired the powder, and scat! away John Godfrey whizzed like a\r\nskyrocket, him and his crowbar! Well, sir, he kept on going up in the\r\nair higher and higher, till he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look any bigger than a boy\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\nkept going on up higher and higher, till he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look any bigger than\r\na doll\xe2\x80\x94and he kept on going up higher and higher, till he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nany bigger than a little small bee\xe2\x80\x94and then he went out of sight!\r\nPresently he came in sight again, looking like a little small bee\xe2\x80\x94and he\r\ncame along down further and further, till he looked as big as a doll\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94and down further and further, till he was as big as a boy\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94and further and further, till he was a full-sized man once more;\r\nand then him and his crowbar came a wh-izzing down and lit right exactly\r\nin the same old tracks and went to r-ramming down, and r-ramming down,\r\nand r-ramming down again, just the same as if nothing had happened! Now\r\ndo you know, that poor cuss warn\xe2\x80\x99t gone only sixteen minutes, and yet\r\nthat Incorporated Company of Mean Men DOCKED HIM FOR THE LOST TIME!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n555.jpg (42K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI said I had the headache, and so excused myself and went home. And on\r\nmy diary I entered \xe2\x80\x9canother night spoiled\xe2\x80\x9d by this offensive loafer. And\r\na fervent curse was set down with it to keep the item company. And the\r\nvery next day I packed up, out of all patience, and left the Island.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the very beginning, I regarded that man as a liar\r\n.................................\r\n\r\nThe line of points represents an interval of years. At the end of which\r\ntime the opinion hazarded in that last sentence came to be gratifyingly\r\nand remarkably endorsed, and by wholly disinterested persons. The man\r\nMarkiss was found one morning hanging to a beam of his own bedroom (the\r\ndoors and windows securely fastened on the inside), dead; and on his\r\nbreast was pinned a paper in his own handwriting begging his friends to\r\nsuspect no innocent person of having any thing to do with his death, for\r\nthat it was the work of his own hands entirely. Yet the jury brought in\r\nthe astounding verdict that deceased came to his death \xe2\x80\x9cby the hands of\r\nsome person or persons unknown!\xe2\x80\x9d They explained that the perfectly\r\nundeviating consistency of Markiss\xe2\x80\x99s character for thirty years towered\r\naloft as colossal and indestructible testimony, that whatever statement\r\nhe chose to make was entitled to instant and unquestioning acceptance as\r\na _lie_. And they furthermore stated their belief that he was not dead,\r\nand instanced the strong circumstantial evidence of his own word that he\r\n_was_ dead\xe2\x80\x94and beseeched the coroner to delay the funeral as long as\r\npossible, which was done. And so in the tropical climate of Lahaina the\r\ncoffin stood open for seven days, and then even the loyal jury gave him\r\nup. But they sat on him again, and changed their verdict to \xe2\x80\x9csuicide\r\ninduced by mental aberration\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94because, said they, with penetration, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nsaid he was dead, and he _was_ dead; and would he have told the truth if\r\nhe had been in his right mind? No, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n557.jpg (26K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter half a year\xe2\x80\x99s luxurious vagrancy in the islands, I took shipping\r\nin a sailing vessel, and regretfully returned to San Francisco\xe2\x80\x94a voyage\r\nin every way delightful, but without an incident: unless lying two long\r\nweeks in a dead calm, eighteen hundred miles from the nearest land, may\r\nrank as an incident. Schools of whales grew so tame that day after day\r\nthey played about the ship among the porpoises and the sharks without\r\nthe least apparent fear of us, and we pelted them with empty bottles for\r\nlack of better sport. Twenty-four hours afterward these bottles would be\r\nstill lying on the glassy water under our noses, showing that the ship\r\nhad not moved out of her place in all that time. The calm was absolutely\r\nbreathless, and the surface of the sea absolutely without a wrinkle. For\r\na whole day and part of a night we lay so close to another ship that had\r\ndrifted to our vicinity, that we carried on conversations with her\r\npassengers, introduced each other by name, and became pretty intimately\r\nacquainted with people we had never heard of before, and have never\r\nheard of since. This was the only vessel we saw during the whole lonely\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n559.jpg (91K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had fifteen passengers, and to show how hard pressed they were at\r\nlast for occupation and amusement, I will mention that the gentlemen\r\ngave a good part of their time every day, during the calm, to trying to\r\nsit on an empty champagne bottle (lying on its side), and thread a\r\nneedle without touching their heels to the deck, or falling over; and\r\nthe ladies sat in the shade of the mainsail, and watched the enterprise\r\nwith absorbing interest. We were at sea five Sundays; and yet, but for\r\nthe almanac, we never would have known but that all the other days were\r\nSundays too.\r\n\r\nI was home again, in San Francisco, without means and without\r\nemployment. I tortured my brain for a saving scheme of some kind, and at\r\nlast a public lecture occurred to me! I sat down and wrote one, in a\r\nfever of hopeful anticipation. I showed it to several friends, but they\r\nall shook their heads. They said nobody would come to hear me, and I\r\nwould make a humiliating failure of it.\r\n\r\nThey said that as I had never spoken in public, I would break down in\r\nthe delivery, anyhow. I was disconsolate now. But at last an editor\r\nslapped me on the back and told me to \xe2\x80\x9cgo ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cTake the\r\nlargest house in town, and charge a dollar a ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d The audacity of\r\nthe proposition was charming; it seemed fraught with practical worldly\r\nwisdom, however. The proprietor of the several theatres endorsed the\r\nadvice, and said I might have his handsome new opera-house at half\r\nprice\xe2\x80\x94fifty dollars. In sheer desperation I took it\xe2\x80\x94on credit, for\r\nsufficient reasons. In three days I did a hundred and fifty dollars\xe2\x80\x99\r\nworth of printing and advertising, and was the most distressed and\r\nfrightened creature on the Pacific coast. I could not sleep\xe2\x80\x94who could,\r\nunder such circumstances? For other people there was facetiousness in\r\nthe last line of my posters, but to me it was plaintive with a pang when\r\nI wrote it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoors open at 7 1/2. The trouble will begin at 8.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat line has done good service since. Showmen have borrowed it\r\nfrequently. I have even seen it appended to a newspaper advertisement\r\nreminding school pupils in vacation what time next term would begin. As\r\nthose three days of suspense dragged by, I grew more and more unhappy. I\r\nhad sold two hundred tickets among my personal friends, but I feared\r\nthey might not come. My lecture, which had seemed \xe2\x80\x9chumorous\xe2\x80\x9d to me, at\r\nfirst, grew steadily more and more dreary, till not a vestige of fun\r\nseemed left, and I grieved that I could not bring a coffin on the stage\r\nand turn the thing into a funeral. I was so panic-stricken, at last,\r\nthat I went to three old friends, giants in stature, cordial by nature,\r\nand stormy-voiced, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis thing is going to be a failure; the jokes in it are so dim that\r\nnobody will ever see them; I would like to have you sit in the\r\nparquette, and help me through.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey said they would. Then I went to the wife of a popular citizen, and\r\nsaid that if she was willing to do me a very great kindness, I would be\r\nglad if she and her husband would sit prominently in the left-hand\r\nstage- box, where the whole house could see them. I explained that I\r\nshould need help, and would turn toward her and smile, as a signal, when\r\nI had been delivered of an obscure joke\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cand then,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t wait\r\nto investigate, but _respond_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe promised. Down the street I met a man I never had seen before. He\r\nhad been drinking, and was beaming with smiles and good nature. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name\xe2\x80\x99s Sawyer. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know me, but that don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot a cent, but if you knew how bad I wanted to laugh, you\xe2\x80\x99d give me a\r\nticket. Come, now, what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs your laugh hung on a hair-trigger?\xe2\x80\x94that is, is it critical, or can\r\nyou get it off _easy_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy drawling infirmity of speech so affected him that he laughed a\r\nspecimen or two that struck me as being about the article I wanted, and\r\nI gave him a ticket, and appointed him to sit in the second circle, in\r\nthe centre, and be responsible for that division of the house. I gave\r\nhim minute instructions about how to detect indistinct jokes, and then\r\nwent away, and left him chuckling placidly over the novelty of the idea.\r\n\r\nI ate nothing on the last of the three eventful days\xe2\x80\x94I only suffered. I\r\nhad advertised that on this third day the box-office would be opened for\r\nthe sale of reserved seats. I crept down to the theater at four in the\r\nafternoon to see if any sales had been made. The ticket seller was gone,\r\nthe box-office was locked up. I had to swallow suddenly, or my heart\r\nwould have got out. \xe2\x80\x9cNo sales,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself; \xe2\x80\x9cI might have known\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought of suicide, pretended illness, flight. I thought of these\r\nthings in earnest, for I was very miserable and scared. But of course I\r\nhad to drive them away, and prepare to meet my fate. I could not wait\r\nfor half-past seven\xe2\x80\x94I wanted to face the horror, and end it\xe2\x80\x94the feeling\r\nof many a man doomed to hang, no doubt. I went down back streets at six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and entered the theatre by the back door. I stumbled my way in\r\nthe dark among the ranks of canvas scenery, and stood on the stage. The\r\nhouse was gloomy and silent, and its emptiness depressing. I went into\r\nthe dark among the scenes again, and for an hour and a half gave myself\r\nup to the horrors, wholly unconscious of everything else. Then I heard a\r\nmurmur; it rose higher and higher, and ended in a crash, mingled with\r\ncheers. It made my hair raise, it was so close to me, and so loud.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, and then another; presently came a third, and before\r\nI well knew what I was about, I was in the middle of the stage, staring\r\nat a sea of faces, bewildered by the fierce glare of the lights, and\r\nquaking in every limb with a terror that seemed like to take my life\r\naway. The house was full, aisles and all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n561.jpg (45K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tumult in my heart and brain and legs continued a full minute before\r\nI could gain any command over myself. Then I recognized the charity and\r\nthe friendliness in the faces before me, and little by little my fright\r\nmelted away, and I began to talk. Within three or four minutes I was\r\ncomfortable, and even content. My three chief allies, with three\r\nauxiliaries, were on hand, in the parquette, all sitting together, all\r\narmed with bludgeons, and all ready to make an onslaught upon the\r\nfeeblest joke that might show its head. And whenever a joke did fall,\r\ntheir bludgeons came down and their faces seemed to split from ear to\r\near;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n562.jpg (153K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSawyer, whose hearty countenance was seen looming redly in the centre of\r\nthe second circle, took it up, and the house was carried handsomely.\r\nInferior jokes never fared so royally before. Presently I delivered a\r\nbit of serious matter with impressive unction (it was my pet), and the\r\naudience listened with an absorbed hush that gratified me more than any\r\napplause; and as I dropped the last word of the clause, I happened to\r\nturn and catch Mrs.\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99s intent and waiting eye; my conversation with her\r\nflashed upon me, and in spite of all I could do I smiled. She took it\r\nfor the signal, and promptly delivered a mellow laugh that touched off\r\nthe whole audience; and the explosion that followed was the triumph of\r\nthe evening. I thought that that honest man Sawyer would choke himself;\r\nand as for the bludgeons, they performed like pile-drivers. But my poor\r\nlittle morsel of pathos was ruined. It was taken in good faith as an\r\nintentional joke, and the prize one of the entertainment, and I wisely\r\nlet it go at that.\r\n\r\nAll the papers were kind in the morning; my appetite returned; I had a\r\nabundance of money. All\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI launched out as a lecturer, now, with great boldness. I had the field\r\nall to myself, for public lectures were almost an unknown commodity in\r\nthe Pacific market. They are not so rare, now, I suppose. I took an old\r\npersonal friend along to play agent for me, and for two or three weeks\r\nwe roamed through Nevada and California and had a very cheerful time of\r\nit. Two days before I lectured in Virginia City, two stagecoaches were\r\nrobbed within two miles of the town. The daring act was committed just\r\nat dawn, by six masked men, who sprang up alongside the coaches,\r\npresented revolvers at the heads of the drivers and passengers, and\r\ncommanded a general dismount. Everybody climbed down, and the robbers\r\ntook their watches and every cent they had. Then they took gunpowder and\r\nblew up the express specie boxes and got their contents. The leader of\r\nthe robbers was a small, quick-spoken man, and the fame of his vigorous\r\nmanner and his intrepidity was in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s mouth when we arrived.\r\n\r\nThe night after instructing Virginia, I walked over the desolate\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdivide\xe2\x80\x9d and down to Gold Hill, and lectured there. The lecture done, I\r\nstopped to talk with a friend, and did not start back till eleven. The\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdivide\xe2\x80\x9d was high, unoccupied ground, between the towns, the scene of\r\ntwenty midnight murders and a hundred robberies. As we climbed up and\r\nstepped out on this eminence, the Gold Hill lights dropped out of sight\r\nat our backs, and the night closed down gloomy and dismal. A sharp wind\r\nswept the place, too, and chilled our perspiring bodies through.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you I don\xe2\x80\x99t like this place at night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike the agent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak so loud,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t remind anybody that we\r\nare here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJust then a dim figure approached me from the direction of Virginia\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nman, evidently. He came straight at me, and I stepped aside to let him\r\npass; he stepped in the way and confronted me again. Then I saw that he\r\nhad a mask on and was holding something in my face\xe2\x80\x94I heard a click-click\r\nand recognized a revolver in dim outline. I pushed the barrel aside with\r\nmy hand and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe ejaculated sharply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour watch! Your money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can have them with pleasure\xe2\x80\x94but take the pistol away from my face,\r\nplease. It makes me shiver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo remarks! Hand out your money!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut up your _hands_! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you go for a weapon! Put \xe2\x80\x99em up! Higher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI held them above my head.\r\n\r\nA pause. Then:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Are_ you going to hand out your money or _not_?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dropped my hands to my pockets and said:\r\n\r\nCertainly! I\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut up your hands! Do you want your head blown off? Higher!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put them above my head again.\r\n\r\nAnother pause.\r\n\r\nAre you going to hand out your money or not? Ah-ah\xe2\x80\x94again? Put up your\r\nhands! By George, you want the head shot off you awful bad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, friend, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying my best to please you. You tell me to give up\r\nmy money, and when I reach for it you tell me to put up my hands. If you\r\nwould only\xe2\x80\x94. Oh, now\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t! All six of you at me! That other man will\r\nget away while.\xe2\x80\x94Now please take some of those revolvers out of my\r\nface\xe2\x80\x94_do_, if you _please_! Every time one of them clicks, my liver\r\ncomes up into my throat! If you have a mother\xe2\x80\x94any of you\xe2\x80\x94or if any of\r\nyou have ever _had_ a mother\xe2\x80\x94or a\xe2\x80\x94grandmother\xe2\x80\x94or a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCheese it! _Will_ you give up your money, or have we got to\xe2\x80\x94.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x94none of that! Put up your _hands_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen\xe2\x80\x94I know you are gentlemen by your\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence! If you want to be facetious, young man, there are times and\r\nplaces more fitting. _This_ is a serious business.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou prick the marrow of my opinion. The funerals I have attended in my\r\ntime were comedies compared to it. Now _I_ think\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCurse your palaver! Your money!\xe2\x80\x94your money!\xe2\x80\x94your money! Hold!\xe2\x80\x94put up\r\nyour hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, listen to reason. You _see_ how I am situated\xe2\x80\x94now _don\xe2\x80\x99t_\r\nput those pistols so close\xe2\x80\x94I smell the powder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see how I am situated. If I had four hands\xe2\x80\x94so that I could hold up\r\ntwo and\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrottle him! Gag him! Kill him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_! Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s watching the other fellow. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t some\r\nof you\xe2\x80\x94. Ouch! Take it away, please!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, you see that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to hold up my hands; and so I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake out my money\xe2\x80\x94but if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be so kind as to take it out for me, I\r\nwill do as much for you some\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSearch him Beauregard\xe2\x80\x94and stop his jaw with a bullet, quick, if he wags\r\nit again. Help Beauregard, Stonewall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen three of them, with the small, spry leader, adjourned to Mike and\r\nfell to searching him. I was so excited that my lawless fancy tortured\r\nme to ask my two men all manner of facetious questions about their rebel\r\nbrother-generals of the South, but, considering the order they had\r\nreceived, it was but common prudence to keep still. When everything had\r\nbeen taken from me,\xe2\x80\x94watch, money, and a multitude of trifles of small\r\nvalue,\xe2\x80\x94I supposed I was free, and forthwith put my cold hands into my\r\nempty pockets and began an inoffensive jig to warm my feet and stir up\r\nsome latent courage\xe2\x80\x94but instantly all pistols were at my head, and the\r\norder came again:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe still! Put up your hands! And keep them up!\xe2\x80\x9d.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n567.jpg (72K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey stood Mike up alongside of me, with strict orders to keep his hands\r\nabove his head, too, and then the chief highwayman said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeauregard, hide behind that boulder; Phil Sheridan, you hide behind\r\nthat other one; Stonewall Jackson, put yourself behind that sage-bush\r\nthere. Keep your pistols bearing on these fellows, and if they take down\r\ntheir hands within ten minutes, or move a single peg, let them have it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen three disappeared in the gloom toward the several ambushes, and the\r\nother three disappeared down the road toward Virginia.\r\n\r\nIt was depressingly still, and miserably cold. Now this whole thing was\r\na practical joke, and the robbers were personal friends of ours in\r\ndisguise, and twenty more lay hidden within ten feet of us during the\r\nwhole operation, listening. Mike knew all this, and was in the joke, but\r\nI suspected nothing of it. To me it was most uncomfortably genuine. When\r\nwe had stood there in the middle of the road five minutes, like a couple\r\nof idiots, with our hands aloft, freezing to death by inches, Mike\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninterest in the joke began to wane. He said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time\xe2\x80\x99s up, now, aint it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you keep still. Do you want to take any chances with these bloody\r\nsavages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPresently Mike said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Now_ the time\xe2\x80\x99s up, anyway. I\xe2\x80\x99m freezing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell freeze. Better freeze than carry your brains home in a basket.\r\nMaybe the time _is_ up, but how do _we_ know?\xe2\x80\x94got no watch to tell by. I\r\nmean to give them good measure. I calculate to stand here fifteen\r\nminutes or die. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you move.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, without knowing it, I was making one joker very sick of his\r\ncontract. When we took our arms down at last, they were aching with cold\r\nand fatigue, and when we went sneaking off, the dread I was in that the\r\ntime might not yet be up and that we would feel bullets in a moment, was\r\nnot sufficient to draw all my attention from the misery that racked my\r\nstiffened body.\r\n\r\nThe joke of these highwayman friends of ours was mainly a joke upon\r\nthemselves; for they had waited for me on the cold hill-top two full\r\nhours before I came, and there was very little fun in that; they were so\r\nchilled that it took them a couple of weeks to get warm again. Moreover,\r\nI never had a thought that they would kill me to get money which it was\r\nso perfectly easy to get without any such folly, and so they did not\r\nreally frighten me bad enough to make their enjoyment worth the trouble\r\nthey had taken. I was only afraid that their weapons would go off\r\naccidentally. Their very numbers inspired me with confidence that no\r\nblood would be intentionally spilled. They were not smart; they ought to\r\nhave sent only _one_ highwayman, with a double-barrelled shot gun, if\r\nthey desired to see the author of this volume climb a tree.\r\n\r\nHowever, I suppose that in the long run I got the largest share of the\r\njoke at last; and in a shape not foreseen by the highwaymen; for the\r\nchilly exposure on the \xe2\x80\x9cdivide\xe2\x80\x9d while I was in a perspiration gave me a\r\ncold which developed itself into a troublesome disease and kept my hands\r\nidle some three months, besides costing me quite a sum in doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbills. Since then I play no practical jokes on people and generally lose\r\nmy temper when one is played upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n569.jpg (39K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to San Francisco I projected a pleasure journey to Japan\r\nand thence westward around the world; but a desire to see home again\r\nchanged my mind, and I took a berth in the steamship, bade good-bye to\r\nthe friendliest land and livest, heartiest community on our continent,\r\nand came by the way of the Isthmus to New York\xe2\x80\x94a trip that was not much\r\nof a pic-nic excursion, for the cholera broke out among us on the\r\npassage and we buried two or three bodies at sea every day. I found home\r\na dreary place after my long absence; for half the children I had known\r\nwere now wearing whiskers or waterfalls, and few of the grown people I\r\nhad been acquainted with remained at their hearthstones prosperous and\r\nhappy\xe2\x80\x94some of them had wandered to other scenes, some were in jail, and\r\nthe rest had been hanged. These changes touched me deeply, and I went\r\naway and joined the famous Quaker City European Excursion and carried my\r\ntears to foreign lands.\r\n\r\nThus, after seven years of vicissitudes, ended a \xe2\x80\x9cpleasure trip\xe2\x80\x9d to the\r\nsilver mines of Nevada which had originally been intended to occupy only\r\nthree months. However, I usually miss my calculations further than that.\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nIf the reader thinks he is done, now, and that this book has no moral to\r\nit, he is in error. The moral of it is this: If you are of any account,\r\nstay at home and make your way by faithful diligence; but if you are \xe2\x80\x9cno\r\naccount,\xe2\x80\x9d go away from home, and then you will _have_ to work, whether\r\nyou want to or not. Thus you become a blessing to your friends by\r\nceasing to be a nuisance to them\xe2\x80\x94if the people you go among suffer by\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n570.jpg (75K)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX. A.\r\n\r\nBRIEF SKETCH OF MORMON HISTORY.\r\n\r\nMormonism is only about forty years old, but its career has been full of\r\nstir and adventure from the beginning, and is likely to remain so to the\r\nend. Its adherents have been hunted and hounded from one end of the\r\ncountry to the other, and the result is that for years they have hated\r\nall \xe2\x80\x9cGentiles\xe2\x80\x9d indiscriminately and with all their might. Joseph Smith,\r\nthe finder of the Book of Mormon and founder of the religion, was driven\r\nfrom State to State with his mysterious copperplates and the miraculous\r\nstones he read their inscriptions with. Finally he instituted his\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchurch\xe2\x80\x9d in Ohio and Brigham Young joined it. The neighbors began to\r\npersecute, and apostasy commenced. Brigham held to the faith and worked\r\nhard. He arrested desertion. He did more\xe2\x80\x94he added converts in the midst\r\nof the trouble. He rose in favor and importance with the brethren. He\r\nwas made one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church. He shortly fought his\r\nway to a higher post and a more powerful\xe2\x80\x94President of the Twelve. The\r\nneighbors rose up and drove the Mormons out of Ohio, and they settled in\r\nMissouri. Brigham went with them. The Missourians drove them out and\r\nthey retreated to Nauvoo, Illinois. They prospered there, and built a\r\ntemple which made some pretensions to architectural grace and achieved\r\nsome celebrity in a section of country where a brick court-house with a\r\ntin dome and a cupola on it was contemplated with reverential awe. But\r\nthe Mormons were badgered and harried again by their neighbors. All the\r\nproclamations Joseph Smith could issue denouncing polygamy and\r\nrepudiating it as utterly anti-Mormon were of no avail; the people of\r\nthe neighborhood, on both sides of the Mississippi, claimed that\r\npolygamy was practised by the Mormons, and not only polygamy but a\r\nlittle of everything that was bad. Brigham returned from a mission to\r\nEngland, where he had established a Mormon newspaper, and he brought\r\nback with him several hundred converts to his preaching. His influence\r\namong the brethren augmented with every move he made. Finally Nauvoo was\r\ninvaded by the Missouri and Illinois Gentiles, and Joseph Smith killed.\r\nA Mormon named Rigdon assumed the Presidency of the Mormon church and\r\ngovernment, in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s place, and even tried his hand at a prophecy or\r\ntwo. But a greater than he was at hand. Brigham seized the advantage of\r\nthe hour and without other authority than superior brain and nerve and\r\nwill, hurled Rigdon from his high place and occupied it himself. He did\r\nmore. He launched an elaborate curse at Rigdon and his disciples; and he\r\npronounced Rigdon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprophecies\xe2\x80\x9d emanations from the devil, and ended by\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chanding the false prophet over to the buffetings of Satan for a\r\nthousand years\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94probably the longest term ever inflicted in Illinois.\r\nThe people recognized their master. They straightway elected Brigham\r\nYoung President, by a prodigious majority, and have never faltered in\r\ntheir devotion to him from that day to this. Brigham had forecast\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nquality which no other prominent Mormon has probably ever possessed. He\r\nrecognized that it was better to move to the wilderness than _be_ moved.\r\nBy his command the people gathered together their meagre effects, turned\r\ntheir backs upon their homes, and their faces toward the wilderness, and\r\non a bitter night in February filed in sorrowful procession across the\r\nfrozen Mississippi, lighted on their way by the glare from their burning\r\ntemple, whose sacred furniture their own hands had fired! They camped,\r\nseveral days afterward, on the western verge of Iowa, and poverty, want,\r\nhunger, cold, sickness, grief and persecution did their work, and many\r\nsuccumbed and died\xe2\x80\x94martyrs, fair and true, whatever else they might have\r\nbeen. Two years the remnant remained there, while Brigham and a small\r\nparty crossed the country and founded Great Salt Lake City, purposely\r\nchoosing a land _which was outside the ownership and jurisdiction of the\r\nhated American nation_. Note that. This was in 1847. Brigham moved his\r\npeople there and got them settled just in time to see disaster fall\r\nagain. For the war closed and Mexico ceded Brigham\xe2\x80\x99s refuge to the\r\nenemy\xe2\x80\x94the United States! In 1849 the Mormons organized a \xe2\x80\x9cfree and\r\nindependent\xe2\x80\x9d government and erected the \xe2\x80\x9cState of Deseret,\xe2\x80\x9d with Brigham\r\nYoung as its head. But the very next year Congress deliberately snubbed\r\nit and created the \xe2\x80\x9cTerritory of Utah\xe2\x80\x9d out of the same accumulation of\r\nmountains, sage-brush, alkali and general desolation,\xe2\x80\x94but made Brigham\r\nGovernor of it. Then for years the enormous migration across the plains\r\nto California poured through the land of the Mormons and yet the church\r\nremained staunch and true to its lord and master. Neither hunger,\r\nthirst, poverty, grief, hatred, contempt, nor persecution could drive\r\nthe Mormons from their faith or their allegiance; and even the thirst\r\nfor gold, which gleaned the flower of the youth and strength of many\r\nnations was not able to entice them! That was the final test. An\r\nexperiment that could survive that was an experiment with some substance\r\nto it somewhere.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake City throve finely, and so did Utah. One of the last\r\nthings which Brigham Young had done before leaving Iowa, was to appear\r\nin the pulpit dressed to personate the worshipped and lamented prophet\r\nSmith, and confer the prophetic succession, with all its dignities,\r\nemoluments and authorities, upon \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Brigham Young!\xe2\x80\x9d The people\r\naccepted the pious fraud with the maddest enthusiasm, and Brigham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npower was sealed and secured for all time. Within five years afterward\r\nhe openly added polygamy to the tenets of the church by authority of a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9crevelation\xe2\x80\x9d which he pretended had been received nine years before by\r\nJoseph Smith, albeit Joseph is amply on record as denouncing polygamy to\r\nthe day of his death.\r\n\r\nNow was Brigham become a second Andrew Johnson in the small beginning\r\nand steady progress of his official grandeur. He had served successively\r\nas a disciple in the ranks; home missionary; foreign missionary; editor\r\nand publisher; Apostle; President of the Board of Apostles; President of\r\nall Mormondom, civil and ecclesiastical; successor to the great Joseph\r\nby the will of heaven; \xe2\x80\x9cprophet,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cseer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crevelator.\xe2\x80\x9d There was but one\r\ndignity higher which he _could_ aspire to, and he reached out modestly\r\nand took that\xe2\x80\x94he proclaimed himself a God!\r\n\r\nHe claims that he is to have a heaven of his own hereafter, and that he\r\nwill be its God, and his wives and children its goddesses, princes and\r\nprincesses. Into it all faithful Mormons will be admitted, with their\r\nfamilies, and will take rank and consequence according to the number of\r\ntheir wives and children. If a disciple dies before he has had time to\r\naccumulate enough wives and children to enable him to be respectable in\r\nthe next world any friend can marry a few wives and raise a few children\r\nfor him _after he is dead_, and they are duly credited to his account\r\nand his heavenly status advanced accordingly.\r\n\r\nLet it be borne in mind that the majority of the Mormons have always\r\nbeen ignorant, simple, of an inferior order of intellect, unacquainted\r\nwith the world and its ways; and let it be borne in mind that the wives\r\nof these Mormons are necessarily after the same pattern and their\r\nchildren likely to be fit representatives of such a conjunction; and\r\nthen let it be remembered that _for forty years_ these creatures have\r\nbeen driven, driven, driven, relentlessly! and mobbed, beaten, and shot\r\ndown; cursed, despised, expatriated; banished to a remote desert,\r\nwhither they journeyed gaunt with famine and disease, disturbing the\r\nancient solitudes with their lamentations and marking the long way with\r\ngraves of their dead\xe2\x80\x94and all because they were simply trying to live and\r\nworship God in the way which _they_ believed with all their hearts and\r\nsouls to be the true one. Let all these things be borne in mind, and\r\nthen it will not be hard to account for the deathless hatred which the\r\nMormons bear our people and our government.\r\n\r\nThat hatred has \xe2\x80\x9cfed fat its ancient grudge\xe2\x80\x9d ever since Mormon Utah\r\ndeveloped into a self-supporting realm and the church waxed rich and\r\nstrong. Brigham as Territorial Governor made it plain that Mormondom was\r\nfor the Mormons. The United States tried to rectify all that by\r\nappointing territorial officers from New England and other anti-Mormon\r\nlocalities, but Brigham prepared to make their entrance into his\r\ndominions difficult. Three thousand United States troops had to go\r\nacross the plains and put these gentlemen in office. And after they were\r\nin office they were as helpless as so many stone images. They made laws\r\nwhich nobody minded and which could not be executed. The federal judges\r\nopened court in a land filled with crime and violence and sat as holiday\r\nspectacles for insolent crowds to gape at\xe2\x80\x94for there was nothing to try,\r\nnothing to do nothing on the dockets! And if a Gentile brought a suit,\r\nthe Mormon jury would do just as it pleased about bringing in a verdict,\r\nand when the judgment of the court was rendered no Mormon cared for it\r\nand no officer could execute it. Our Presidents shipped one cargo of\r\nofficials after another to Utah, but the result was always the same\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nsat in a blight for awhile they fairly feasted on scowls and insults day\r\nby day, they saw every attempt to do their official duties find its\r\nreward in darker and darker looks, and in secret threats and warnings of\r\na more and more dismal nature\xe2\x80\x94and at last they either succumbed and\r\nbecame despised tools and toys of the Mormons, or got scared and\r\ndiscomforted beyond all endurance and left the Territory. If a brave\r\nofficer kept on courageously till his pluck was proven, some pliant\r\nBuchanan or Pierce would remove him and appoint a stick in his place. In\r\n1857 General Harney came very near being appointed Governor of Utah. And\r\nso it came very near being Harney governor and Cradlebaugh judge!\xe2\x80\x94two\r\nmen who never had any idea of fear further than the sort of murky\r\ncomprehension of it which they were enabled to gather from the\r\ndictionary. Simply (if for nothing else) for the variety they would have\r\nmade in a rather monotonous history of Federal servility and\r\nhelplessness, it is a pity they were not fated to hold office together\r\nin Utah.\r\n\r\nUp to the date of our visit to Utah, such had been the Territorial\r\nrecord. The Territorial government established there had been a hopeless\r\nfailure, and Brigham Young was the only real power in the land. He was\r\nan absolute monarch\xe2\x80\x94a monarch who defied our President\xe2\x80\x94a monarch who\r\nlaughed at our armies when they camped about his capital\xe2\x80\x94a monarch who\r\nreceived without emotion the news that the august Congress of the United\r\nStates had enacted a solemn law against polygamy, and then went forth\r\ncalmly and married twenty-five or thirty more wives.\r\n\r\nB. THE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions which the Mormons suffered so long\xe2\x80\x94and which they\r\nconsider they still suffer in not being allowed to govern\r\nthemselves\xe2\x80\x94they have endeavored and are still endeavoring to repay. The\r\nnow almost forgotten \xe2\x80\x9cMountain Meadows massacre\xe2\x80\x9d was their work. It was\r\nvery famous in its day. The whole United States rang with its horrors. A\r\nfew items will refresh the reader\xe2\x80\x99s memory. A great emigrant train from\r\nMissouri and Arkansas passed through Salt Lake City and a few\r\ndisaffected Mormons joined it for the sake of the strong protection it\r\nafforded for their escape. In that matter lay sufficient cause for hot\r\nretaliation by the Mormon chiefs. Besides, these one hundred and forty-\r\nfive or one hundred and fifty unsuspecting emigrants being in part from\r\nArkansas, where a noted Mormon missionary had lately been killed, and in\r\npart from Missouri, a State remembered with execrations as a bitter\r\npersecutor of the saints when they were few and poor and friendless,\r\nhere were substantial additional grounds for lack of love for these\r\nwayfarers. And finally, this train was rich, very rich in cattle,\r\nhorses, mules and other property\xe2\x80\x94and how could the Mormons consistently\r\nkeep up their coveted resemblance to the Israelitish tribes and not\r\nseize the \xe2\x80\x9cspoil\xe2\x80\x9d of an enemy when the Lord had so manifestly \xe2\x80\x9cdelivered\r\nit into their hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWherefore, according to Mrs. C. V. Waite\xe2\x80\x99s entertaining book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nMormon Prophet,\xe2\x80\x9d it transpired that\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA \xe2\x80\x98revelation\xe2\x80\x99 from Brigham Young, as Great Grand Archee or God, was\r\ndispatched to President J. C. Haight, Bishop Higbee and J. D. Lee\r\n(adopted son of Brigham), commanding them to raise all the forces they\r\ncould muster and trust, follow those cursed Gentiles (so read the\r\nrevelation), attack them disguised as Indians, and with the arrows of\r\nthe Almighty make a clean sweep of them, and leave none to tell the\r\ntale; and if they needed any assistance they were commanded to hire the\r\nIndians as their allies, promising them a share of the booty. They were\r\nto be neither slothful nor negligent in their duty, and to be punctual\r\nin sending the teams back to him before winter set in, for this was the\r\nmandate of Almighty God.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe command of the \xe2\x80\x9crevelation\xe2\x80\x9d was faithfully obeyed. A large party of\r\nMormons, painted and tricked out as Indians, overtook the train of\r\nemigrant wagons some three hundred miles south of Salt Lake City, and\r\nmade an attack. But the emigrants threw up earthworks, made fortresses\r\nof their wagons and defended themselves gallantly and successfully for\r\nfive days! Your Missouri or Arkansas gentleman is not much afraid of the\r\nsort of scurvy apologies for \xe2\x80\x9cIndians\xe2\x80\x9d which the southern part of Utah\r\naffords. He would stand up and fight five hundred of them.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the five days the Mormons tried military strategy. They\r\nretired to the upper end of the \xe2\x80\x9cMeadows,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed civilized apparel,\r\nwashed off their paint, and then, heavily armed, drove down in wagons to\r\nthe beleaguered emigrants, bearing a flag of truce! When the emigrants\r\nsaw white men coming they threw down their guns and welcomed them with\r\ncheer after cheer! And, all unconscious of the poetry of it, no doubt,\r\nthey lifted a little child aloft, dressed in white, in answer to the\r\nflag of truce!\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the timely white \xe2\x80\x9cdeliverers\xe2\x80\x9d were President Haight and\r\nBishop John D. Lee, of the Mormon Church. Mr. Cradlebaugh, who served a\r\nterm as a Federal Judge in Utah and afterward was sent to Congress from\r\nNevada, tells in a speech delivered in Congress how these leaders next\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey professed to be on good terms with the Indians, and represented\r\nthem as being very mad. They also proposed to intercede and settle the\r\nmatter with the Indians. After several hours parley they, having\r\n(apparently) visited the Indians, gave the _ultimatum_ of the savages;\r\nwhich was, that the emigrants should march out of their camp, leaving\r\neverything behind them, even their guns. It was promised by the Mormon\r\nbishops that they would bring a force and guard the emigrants back to\r\nthe settlements. The terms were agreed to, the emigrants being desirous\r\nof saving the lives of their families. The Mormons retired, and\r\nsubsequently appeared with thirty or forty armed men. The emigrants were\r\nmarched out, the women and children in front and the men behind, the\r\nMormon guard being in the rear. When they had marched in this way about\r\na mile, at a given signal the slaughter commenced. The men were almost\r\nall shot down at the first fire from the guard. Two only escaped, who\r\nfled to the desert, and were followed one hundred and fifty miles before\r\nthey were overtaken and slaughtered. The women and children ran on, two\r\nor three hundred yards further, when they were overtaken and with the\r\naid of the Indians they were slaughtered. Seventeen individuals only, of\r\nall the emigrant party, were spared, and they were little children, the\r\neldest of them being only seven years old. Thus, on the 10th day of\r\nSeptember, 1857, was consummated one of the most cruel, cowardly and\r\nbloody murders known in our history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe number of persons butchered by the Mormons on this occasion was _one\r\nhundred and twenty_.\r\n\r\nWith unheard-of temerity Judge Cradlebaugh opened his court and\r\nproceeded to make Mormondom answer for the massacre. And what a\r\nspectacle it must have been to see this grim veteran, solitary and alone\r\nin his pride and his pluck, glowering down on his Mormon jury and Mormon\r\nauditory, deriding them by turns, and by turns \xe2\x80\x9cbreathing threatenings\r\nand slaughter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the _Territorial Enterprise_ of that day says of him and\r\nof the occasion:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe spoke and acted with the fearlessness and resolution of a Jackson;\r\nbut the jury failed to indict, or even report on the charges, while\r\nthreats of violence were heard in every quarter, and an attack on the\r\nU.S. troops intimated, if he persisted in his course.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinding that nothing could be done with the juries, they were\r\ndischarged with a scathing rebuke from the judge. And then, sitting as a\r\ncommitting magistrate, _he commenced his task alone_. He examined\r\nwitnesses, made arrests in every quarter, and created a consternation in\r\nthe camps of the saints greater than any they had ever witnessed before,\r\nsince Mormondom was born. At last accounts terrified elders and bishops\r\nwere decamping to save their necks; and developments of the most\r\nstarling character were being made, implicating the highest Church\r\ndignitaries in the many murders and robberies committed upon the\r\nGentiles during the past eight years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHad Harney been Governor, Cradlebaugh would have been supported in his\r\nwork, and the absolute proofs adduced by him of Mormon guilt in this\r\nmassacre and in a number of previous murders, would have conferred\r\ngratuitous coffins upon certain citizens, together with occasion to use\r\nthem. But Cumming was the Federal Governor, and he, under a curious\r\npretense of impartiality, sought to screen the Mormons from the demands\r\nof justice. On one occasion he even went so far as to publish his\r\nprotest against the use of the U.S. troops in aid of Cradlebaugh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nMrs. C. V. Waite closes her interesting detail of the great massacre\r\nwith the following remark and accompanying summary of the testimony\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthe summary is concise, accurate and reliable:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the benefit of those who may still be disposed to doubt the guilt\r\nof Young and his Mormons in this transaction, the testimony is here\r\ncollated and circumstances given which go not merely to implicate but to\r\nfasten conviction upon them by \xe2\x80\x98confirmations strong as proofs of Holy\r\nWrit:\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c1. The evidence of Mormons themselves, engaged in the affair, as shown\r\nby the statements of Judge Cradlebaugh and Deputy U.S. Marshall Rodgers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c2. The failure of Brigham Young to embody any account of it in his\r\nReport as Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Also his failure to make any\r\nallusion to it whatever from the pulpit, until several years after the\r\noccurrence\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c3. The flight to the mountains of men high in authority in the Mormon\r\nChurch and State, when this affair was brought to the ordeal of a\r\njudicial investigation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c4. The failure of the _Deseret News_, the Church organ, and the only\r\npaper then published in the Territory, to notice the massacre until\r\nseveral months afterward, and then only to deny that Mormons were\r\nengaged in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c5. The testimony of the children saved from the massacre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c6. The children and the property of the emigrants found in possession\r\nof the Mormons, and that possession traced back to the very day after\r\nthe massacre.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c7. The statements of Indians in the neighborhood of the scene of the\r\nmassacre: these statements are shown, not only by Cradlebaugh and\r\nRodgers, but by a number of military officers, and by J. Forney, who\r\nwas, in 1859, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Territory. To all\r\nthese were such statements freely and frequently made by the Indians.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c8. The testimony of R. P. Campbell, Capt. 2d Dragoons, who was sent in\r\nthe Spring of 1859 to Santa Clara, to protect travelers on the road to\r\nCalifornia and to inquire into Indian depredations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nC. CONCERNING A FRIGHTFUL ASSASSINATION THAT WAS NEVER CONSUMMATED\r\n\r\n[If ever there was a harmless man, it is Conrad Wiegand, of Gold Hill,\r\nNevada. If ever there was a gentle spirit that thought itself unfired\r\ngunpowder and latent ruin, it is Conrad Wiegand. If ever there was an\r\noyster that fancied itself a whale; or a jack-o\xe2\x80\x99lantern, confined to a\r\nswamp, that fancied itself a planet with a billion-mile orbit; or a\r\nsummer zephyr that deemed itself a hurricane, it is Conrad Wiegand.\r\nTherefore, what wonder is it that when he says a thing, he thinks the\r\nworld listens; that when he does a thing the world stands still to look;\r\nand that when he suffers, there is a convulsion of nature? When I met\r\nConrad, he was \xe2\x80\x9cSuperintendent of the Gold Hill Assay Office\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he was\r\nnot only its Superintendent, but its entire force. And he was a street\r\npreacher, too, with a mongrel religion of his own invention, whereby he\r\nexpected to regenerate the universe. This was years ago. Here latterly\r\nhe has entered journalism; and his journalism is what it might be\r\nexpected to be: colossal to ear, but pigmy to the eye. It is extravagant\r\ngrandiloquence confined to a newspaper about the size of a double letter\r\nsheet. He doubtless edits, sets the type, and prints his paper, all\r\nalone; but he delights to speak of the concern as if it occupies a block\r\nand employs a thousand men.\r\n\r\n[Something less than two years ago, Conrad assailed several people\r\nmercilessly in his little \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x99s _Tribune_,\xe2\x80\x9d and got himself into\r\ntrouble. Straightway he airs the affair in the \xe2\x80\x9cTerritorial Enterprise,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nin a communication over his own signature, and I propose to reproduce it\r\nhere, in all its native simplicity and more than human candor. Long as\r\nit is, it is well worth reading, for it is the richest specimen of\r\njournalistic literature the history of America can furnish, perhaps:]\r\n\r\nFrom the _Territorial Enterprise_, Jan. 20, 1870.\r\n\r\nSEEMING PLOT FOR ASSASSINATION MISCARRIED.\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE ENTERPRISE: Months ago, when Mr. Sutro incidentally\r\nexposed mining management on the Comstock, and among others roused me to\r\nprotest against its continuance, in great kindness you warned me that\r\nany attempt by publications, by public meetings and by legislative\r\naction, aimed at the correction of chronic mining evils in Storey\r\nCounty, must entail upon me (a) business ruin, (b) the burden of all its\r\ncosts, (c) personal violence, and if my purpose were persisted in, then\r\n(d) assassination, and after all nothing would be effected.\r\n\r\nYOUR PROPHECY FULFILLING. In large part at least your prophecies have\r\nbeen fulfilled, for (a) assaying, which was well attended to in the Gold\r\nHill Assay Office (of which I am superintendent), in consequence of my\r\npublications, has been taken elsewhere, so the President of one of the\r\ncompanies assures me. With no reason assigned, other work has been taken\r\naway. With but one or two important exceptions, our assay business now\r\nconsists simply of the gleanings of the vicinity. (b) Though my own\r\npersonal donations to the People\xe2\x80\x99s Tribune Association have already\r\nexceeded $1,500, outside of our own numbers we have received (in money)\r\nless than $300 as contributions and subscriptions for the journal. (c)\r\nOn Thursday last, on the main street in Gold Hill, near noon, with\r\nneither warning nor cause assigned, by a powerful blow I was felled to\r\nthe ground, and while down I was kicked by a man who it would seem had\r\nbeen led to believe that I had spoken derogatorily of him. By whom he\r\nwas so induced to believe I am as yet unable to say. On Saturday last I\r\nwas again assailed and beaten by a man who first informed me why he did\r\nso, and who persisted in making his assault even after the erroneous\r\nimpression under which he also was at first laboring had been clearly\r\nand repeatedly pointed out. This same man, after failing through\r\nintimidation to elicit from me the names of our editorial contributors,\r\nagainst giving which he knew me to be pledged, beat himself weary upon\r\nme with a raw hide, I not resisting, and then pantingly threatened me\r\nwith permanent disfiguring mayhem, if ever again I should introduce his\r\nname into print, and who but a few minutes before his attack upon me\r\nassured me that the only reason I was \xe2\x80\x9cpermitted\xe2\x80\x9d to reach home alive on\r\nWednesday evening last (at which time the PEOPLE\xe2\x80\x99S TRIBUNE was issued)\r\nwas, that he deems me only half-witted, and be it remembered the very\r\nnext morning I was knocked down and kicked by a man who seemed to be\r\nprepared for flight. [He sees doom impending:]\r\n\r\nWHEN WILL THE CIRCLE JOIN? How long before the whole of your prophecy\r\nwill be fulfilled I cannot say, but under the shadow of so much\r\nfulfillment in so short a time, and with such threats from a man who is\r\none of the most prominent exponents of the San Francisco mining-ring\r\nstaring me and this whole community defiantly in the face and pointing\r\nto a completion of your augury, do you blame me for feeling that this\r\ncommunication is the last I shall ever write for the Press, especially\r\nwhen a sense alike of personal self-respect, of duty to this money-\r\noppressed and fear-ridden community, and of American fealty to the\r\nspirit of true Liberty all command me, and each more loudly than love of\r\nlife itself, to declare the name of that prominent man to be JOHN B.\r\nWINTERS, President of the Yellow Jacket Company, a political aspirant\r\nand a military General? The name of his partially duped accomplice and\r\nabettor in this last marvelous assault, is no other than PHILIP LYNCH,\r\nEditor and Proprietor of the Gold Hill News.\r\n\r\nDespite the insult and wrong heaped upon me by John B. Winters, on\r\nSaturday afternoon, only a glimpse of which I shall be able to afford\r\nyour readers, so much do I deplore clinching (by publicity) a serious\r\nmistake of any one, man or woman, committed under natural and not self-\r\nwrought passion, in view of his great apparent excitement at the time\r\nand in view of the almost perfect privacy of the assault, I am far from\r\nsure that I should not have given him space for repentance before\r\nexposing him, were it not that he himself has so far exposed the matter\r\nas to make it the common talk of the town that he has horsewhipped me.\r\nThat fact having been made public, all the facts in connection need to\r\nbe also, or silence on my part would seem more than singular, and with\r\nmany would be proof either that I was conscious of some unworthy aim in\r\npublishing the article, or else that my \xe2\x80\x9cnon-combatant\xe2\x80\x9d principles are\r\nbut a convenient cloak alike of physical and moral cowardice. I\r\ntherefore shall try to present a graphic but truthful picture of this\r\nwhole affair, but shall forbear all comments, presuming that the editors\r\nof our own journal, if others do not, will speak freely and fittingly\r\nupon this subject in our next number, whether I shall then be dead or\r\nliving, for my death will not stop, though it may suspend, the\r\npublication of the PEOPLE\xe2\x80\x99S TRIBUNE. [The \xe2\x80\x9cnon-combatant\xe2\x80\x9d sticks to\r\nprinciple, but takes along a friend or two of a conveniently different\r\nstripe:]\r\n\r\nTHE TRAP SET. On Saturday morning John B. Winters sent verbal word to\r\nthe Gold Hill Assay Office that he desired to see me at the Yellow\r\nJacket office. Though such a request struck me as decidedly cool in view\r\nof his own recent discourtesies to me there alike as a publisher and as\r\na stockholder in the Yellow Jacket mine, and though it seemed to me more\r\nlike a summons than the courteous request by one gentleman to another\r\nfor a favor, hoping that some conference with Sharon looking to the\r\nbetterment of mining matters in Nevada might arise from it, I felt\r\nstrongly inclined to overlook what possibly was simply an oversight in\r\ncourtesy. But as then it had only been two days since I had been bruised\r\nand beaten under a hasty and false apprehension of facts, my caution was\r\nsomewhat aroused. Moreover I remembered sensitively his contemptuousness\r\nof manner to me at my last interview in his office. I therefore felt it\r\nneedful, if I went at all, to go accompanied by a friend whom he would\r\nnot dare to treat with incivility, and whose presence with me might\r\nsecure exemption from insult. Accordingly I asked a neighbor to\r\naccompany me.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAP ALMOST DETECTED. Although I was not then aware of this fact, it\r\nwould seem that previous to my request this same neighbor had heard Dr.\r\nZabriskie state publicly in a saloon, that Mr. Winters had told him he\r\nhad decided either to kill or to horsewhip me, but had not finally\r\ndecided on which. My neighbor, therefore, felt unwilling to go down with\r\nme until he had first called on Mr. Winters alone. He therefore paid him\r\na visit. From that interview he assured me that he gathered the\r\nimpression that he did not believe I would have any difficulty with Mr.\r\nWinters, and that he (Winters) would call on me at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in my\r\nown office.\r\n\r\nMY OWN PRECAUTIONS. As Sheriff Cummings was in Gold Hill that afternoon,\r\nand as I desired to converse with him about the previous assault, I\r\ninvited him to my office, and he came. Although a half hour had passed\r\nbeyond four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Mr. Winters had not called, and we both of us began\r\npreparing to go home. Just then, Philip Lynch, Publisher of the Gold\r\nHill News, came in and said, blandly and cheerily, as if bringing good\r\nnews:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHello, John B. Winters wants to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed! Why he sent me word that he would call on me here\r\nthis afternoon at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, well, it don\xe2\x80\x99t do to be too ceremonious just now, he\xe2\x80\x99s in my office,\r\nand that will do as well\xe2\x80\x94come on in, Winters wants to consult with you\r\nalone. He\xe2\x80\x99s got something to say to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough slightly uneasy at this change of programme, yet believing that\r\nin an editor\xe2\x80\x99s house I ought to be safe, and anyhow that I would be\r\nwithin hail of the street, I hurriedly, and but partially whispered my\r\ndim apprehensions to Mr. Cummings, and asked him if he would not keep\r\nnear enough to hear my voice in case I should call. He consented to do\r\nso while waiting for some other parties, and to come in if he heard my\r\nvoice or thought I had need of protection.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the editorial part of the News office, which viewed from the\r\nstreet is dark, I did not see Mr. Winters, and again my misgivings\r\narose. Had I paused long enough to consider the case, I should have\r\ninvited Sheriff Cummings in, but as Lynch went down stairs, he said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis way, Wiegand\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s best to be private,\xe2\x80\x9d or some such remark.\r\n\r\n[I do not desire to strain the reader\xe2\x80\x99s fancy, hurtfully, and yet it\r\nwould be a favor to me if he would try to fancy this lamb in battle, or\r\nthe duelling ground or at the head of a vigilance committee\xe2\x80\x94M. T.:]\r\n\r\nI followed, and without Mr. Cummings, and without arms, which I never do\r\nor will carry, unless as a soldier in war, or unless I should yet come\r\nto feel I must fight a duel, or to join and aid in the ranks of a\r\nnecessary Vigilance Committee. But by following I made a fatal mistake.\r\nFollowing was entering a trap, and whatever animal suffers itself to be\r\ncaught should expect the common fate of a caged rat, as I fear events to\r\ncome will prove.\r\n\r\nTraps commonly are not set for benevolence. [His body-guard is shut\r\nout:]\r\n\r\nTHE TRAP INSIDE. I followed Lynch down stairs. At their foot a door to\r\nthe left opened into a small room. From that room another door opened\r\ninto yet another room, and once entered I found myself inveigled into\r\nwhat many will ever henceforth regard as a private subterranean Gold\r\nHill den, admirably adapted in proper hands to the purposes of murder,\r\nraw or disguised, for from it, with both or even one door closed, when\r\ntoo late, I saw that I could not be heard by Sheriff Cummings, and from\r\nit, BY VIOLENCE AND BY FORCE, I was prevented from making a peaceable\r\nexit, when I thought I saw the studious object of this \xe2\x80\x9cconsultation\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas no other than to compass my killing, in the presence of Philip Lynch\r\nas a witness, as soon as by insult a proverbially excitable man should\r\nbe exasperated to the point of assailing Mr. Winters, so that Mr. Lynch,\r\nby his conscience and by his well known tenderness of heart toward the\r\nrich and potent would be compelled to testify that he saw Gen. John B.\r\nWinters kill Conrad Wiegand in \xe2\x80\x9cself-defence.\xe2\x80\x9d But I am going too fast.\r\n\r\nOUR HOST. Mr. Lynch was present during the most of the time (say a\r\nlittle short of an hour), but three times he left the room. His\r\ntestimony, therefore, would be available only as to the bulk of what\r\ntranspired. On entering this carpeted den I was invited to a seat near\r\none corner of the room. Mr. Lynch took a seat near the window. J. B.\r\nWinters sat (at first) near the door, and began his remarks essentially\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come here to exact of you a retraction, in black and white, of\r\nthose damnably false charges which you have preferred against me in\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x94infamous lying sheet of yours, and you must declare yourself\r\ntheir author, that you published them knowing them to be false, and that\r\nyour motives were malicious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold, Mr. Winters. Your language is insulting and your demand an\r\nenormity. I trust I was not invited here either to be insulted or\r\ncoerced. I supposed myself here by invitation of Mr. Lynch, at your\r\nrequest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor did I come here to insult you. I have already told you that I am\r\nhere for a very different purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet your language has been offensive, and even now shows strong\r\nexcitement. If insult is repeated I shall either leave the room or call\r\nin Sheriff Cummings, whom I just left standing and waiting for me\r\noutside the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you won\xe2\x80\x99t, sir. You may just as well understand it at once as not.\r\nHere you are my man, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why! Months ago you put your\r\nproperty out of your hands, boasting that you did so to escape losing it\r\non prosecution for libel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that I did convert all my immovable property into personal\r\nproperty, such as I could trust safely to others, and chiefly to escape\r\nruin through possible libel suits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir. Having placed yourself beyond the pale of the law, may\r\nGod help your soul if you DON\xe2\x80\x99T make precisely such a retraction as I\r\nhave demanded. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you now, and by\xe2\x80\x94before you can get out of this\r\nroom you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to both write and sign precisely the retraction I have\r\ndemanded, and before you go, anyhow\xe2\x80\x94you \xe2\x80\x94 low-lived \xe2\x80\x94 lying \xe2\x80\x94, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nteach you what personal responsibility is outside of the law; and, by\xe2\x80\x94,\r\nSheriff Cummings and all the friends you\xe2\x80\x99ve got in the world besides,\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t save you, you\xe2\x80\x94-, etc.! _No_, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99m alone now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared\r\nto be shot down just here and now rather than be villified by you as I\r\nhave been, and suffer you to escape me after publishing those charges,\r\nnot only here where I am known and universally respected, but where I am\r\nnot personally known and may be injured.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI confess this speech, with its terrible and but too plainly implied\r\nthreat of killing me if I did not sign the paper he demanded, terrified\r\nme, especially as I saw he was working himself up to the highest\r\npossible pitch of passion, and instinct told me that any reply other\r\nthan one of seeming concession to his demands would only be fuel to a\r\nraging fire, so I replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to sign\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d and then I paused some time. Resuming, I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Winters, you are greatly excited. Besides, I see you are\r\nlaboring under a total misapprehension. It is your duty not to inflame\r\nbut to calm yourself. I am prepared to show you, if you will only point\r\nout the article that you allude to, that you regard as \xe2\x80\x98charges\xe2\x80\x99 what no\r\ncalm and logical mind has any right to regard as such. Show me the\r\ncharges, and I will try, at all events; and if it becomes plain that no\r\ncharges have been preferred, then plainly there can be nothing to\r\nretract, and no one could rightly urge you to demand a retraction. You\r\nshould beware of making so serious a mistake, for however honest a man\r\nmay be, every one is liable to misapprehend. Besides you assume that I\r\nam the author of some certain article which you have not pointed out. It\r\nis hasty to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe then pointed to some numbered paragraphs in a TRIBUNE article, headed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the Matter with Yellow Jacket?\xe2\x80\x9d saying \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I refer to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo gain time for general reflection and resolution, I took up the paper\r\nand looked it over for awhile, he remaining silent, and as I hoped,\r\ncooling. I then resumed saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAs I supposed. I do not admit having\r\nwritten that article, nor have you any right to assume so important a\r\npoint, and then base important action upon your assumption. You might\r\ndeeply regret it afterwards. In my published Address to the People, I\r\nnotified the world that no information as to the authorship of any\r\narticle would be given without the consent of the writer. I therefore\r\ncannot honorably tell you who wrote that article, nor can you exact it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are not the author, then I do demand to know who is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must decline to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, by\xe2\x80\x94, I brand you as its author, and shall treat you accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPassing that point, the most important misapprehension which I notice\r\nis, that you regard them as \xe2\x80\x98charges\xe2\x80\x99 at all, when their context, both\r\nat their beginning and end, show they are not. These words introduce\r\nthem: \xe2\x80\x98Such an investigation [just before indicated], we think MIGHT\r\nresult in showing some of the following points.\xe2\x80\x99 Then follow eleven\r\nspecifications, and the succeeding paragraph shows that the suggested\r\ninvestigation \xe2\x80\x98might EXONERATE those who are generally believed guilty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nYou see, therefore, the context proves they are not preferred as\r\ncharges, and this you seem to have overlooked.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile making those comments, Mr. Winters frequently interrupted me in\r\nsuch a way as to convince me that he was resolved not to consider\r\ncandidly the thoughts contained in my words. He insisted upon it that\r\nthey were charges, and \xe2\x80\x9cBy\xe2\x80\x94,\xe2\x80\x9d he would make me take them back as\r\ncharges, and he referred the question to Philip Lynch, to whom I then\r\nappealed as a literary man, as a logician, and as an editor, calling his\r\nattention especially to the introductory paragraph just before quoted.\r\nHe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cif they are not charges, they certainly are insinuations,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhereupon Mr. Winters renewed his demands for retraction precisely such\r\nas he had before named, except that he would allow me to state who did\r\nwrite the article if I did not myself, and this time shaking his fist in\r\nmy face with more cursings and epithets.\r\n\r\nWhen he threatened me with his clenched fist, instinctively I tried to\r\nrise from my chair, but Winters then forcibly thrust me down, as he did\r\nevery other time (at least seven or eight), when under similar imminent\r\ndanger of bruising by his fist (or for aught I could know worse than\r\nthat after the first stunning blow), which he could easily and safely to\r\nhimself have dealt me so long as he kept me down and stood over me.\r\n\r\nThis fact it was, which more than anything else, convinced me that by\r\nplan and plot I was purposely made powerless in Mr. Winters\xe2\x80\x99 hands, and\r\nthat he did not mean to allow me that advantage of being afoot, which he\r\npossessed. Moreover, I then became convinced, that Philip Lynch (and for\r\nwhat reason I wondered) would do absolutely nothing to protect me in his\r\nown house. I realized then the situation thoroughly. I had found it\r\nequally vain to protest or argue, and I would make no unmanly appeal for\r\npity, still less apologize. Yet my life had been by the plainest\r\npossible implication threatened. I was a weak man. I was unarmed. I was\r\nhelplessly down, and Winters was afoot and probably armed. Lynch was the\r\nonly \xe2\x80\x9cwitness.\xe2\x80\x9d The statements demanded, if given and not explained,\r\nwould utterly sink me in my own self-respect, in my family\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and\r\nin the eyes of the community. On the other hand, should I give the\r\nauthor\xe2\x80\x99s name how could I ever expect that confidence of the People\r\nwhich I should no longer deserve, and how much dearer to me and to my\r\nfamily was my life than the life of the real author to his friends. Yet\r\nlife seemed dear and each minute that remained seemed precious if not\r\nsolemn. I sincerely trust that neither you nor any of your readers, and\r\nespecially none with families, may ever be placed in such seeming direct\r\nproximity to death while obliged to decide the one question I was\r\ncompelled to, viz.: What should I do\xe2\x80\x94I, a man of family, and not as Mr.\r\nWinters is, \xe2\x80\x9calone.\xe2\x80\x9d [The reader is requested not to skip the\r\nfollowing.\xe2\x80\x94M. T.:]\r\n\r\nSTRATEGY AND MESMERISM. To gain time for further reflection, and hoping\r\nthat by a seeming acquiescence I might regain my personal liberty, at\r\nleast till I could give an alarm, or take advantage of some momentary\r\ninadvertence of Winters, and then without a cowardly flight escape, I\r\nresolved to write a certain kind of retraction, but previously had\r\ninwardly decided:\r\n\r\nFirst.\xe2\x80\x94That I would studiously avoid every action which might be\r\nconstrued into the drawing of a weapon, even by a self-infuriated man,\r\nno matter what amount of insult might be heaped upon me, for it seemed\r\nto me that this great excess of compound profanity, foulness and epithet\r\nmust be more than a mere indulgence, and therefore must have some\r\nobject. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nTherefore, as before without thought, I thereafter by intent kept my\r\nhands away from my pockets, and generally in sight and spread upon my\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nSecond.\xe2\x80\x94I resolved to make no motion with my arms or hands which could\r\npossibly be construed into aggression.\r\n\r\nThird.\xe2\x80\x94I resolved completely to govern my outward manner and suppress\r\nindignation. To do this, I must govern my spirit. To do that, by force\r\nof imagination I was obliged like actors on the boards to resolve myself\r\ninto an unnatural mental state and see all things through the eyes of an\r\nassumed character.\r\n\r\nFourth.\xe2\x80\x94I resolved to try on Winters, silently, and unconsciously to\r\nhimself a mesmeric power which I possess over certain kinds of people,\r\nand which at times I have found to work even in the dark over the lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nDoes any one smile at these last counts? God save you from ever being\r\nobliged to beat in a game of chess, whose stake is your life, you having\r\nbut four poor pawns and pieces and your adversary with his full force\r\nunshorn. But if you are, provided you have any strength with breadth of\r\nwill, do not despair. Though mesmeric power may not save you, it may\r\nhelp you; try it at all events. In this instance I was conscious of\r\npower coming into me, and by a law of nature, I know Winters was\r\ncorrespondingly weakened. If I could have gained more time I am sure he\r\nwould not even have struck me.\r\n\r\nIt takes time both to form such resolutions and to recite them. That\r\ntime, however, I gained while thinking of my retraction, which I first\r\nwrote in pencil, altering it from time to time till I got it to suit me,\r\nmy aim being to make it look like a concession to demands, while in fact\r\nit should tersely speak the truth into Mr. Winters\xe2\x80\x99 mind. When it was\r\nfinished, I copied it in ink, and if correctly copied from my first\r\ndraft it should read as follows. In copying I do not think I made any\r\nmaterial change.\r\n\r\nCOPY. To Philip Lynch, Editor of the Gold Hill News: I learn that Gen.\r\nJohn B. Winters believes the following (pasted on) clipping from the\r\nPEOPLE\xe2\x80\x99S TRIBUNE of January to contain distinct charges of mine against\r\nhim personally, and that as such he desires me to retract them\r\nunqualifiedly.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with his request, permit me to say that, although Mr.\r\nWinters and I see this matter differently, in view of his strong\r\nfeelings in the premises, I hereby declare that I do not know those\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccharges\xe2\x80\x9d (if such they are) to be true, and I hope that a critical\r\nexamination would altogether disprove them. CONRAD WIEGAND. Gold Hill,\r\nJanuary 15, 1870.\r\n\r\nI then read what I had written and handed it to Mr. Lynch, whereupon Mr.\r\nWinters said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfactory, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t do;\xe2\x80\x9d and then addressing himself\r\nto Mr. Lynch, he further said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow does it strike you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I confess I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that it retracts anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor do I,\xe2\x80\x9d said Winters; \xe2\x80\x9cin fact, I regard it as adding insult to\r\ninjury. Mr. Wiegand you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do better than that. You are not the\r\nman who can pull wool over my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat, sir, is the only retraction I can write.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, sir, and if you so much as say so again you do it at your\r\nperil, for I\xe2\x80\x99ll thrash you to within an inch of your life, and, by\xe2\x80\x94,\r\nsir, I don\xe2\x80\x99t pledge myself to spare you even that inch either. I want\r\nyou to understand I have asked you for a very different paper, and that\r\npaper you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to sign.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Winters, I assure you that I do not wish to irritate you, but, at\r\nthe same time, it is utterly impossible for me to write any other paper\r\nthan that which I have written. If you are resolved to compel me to sign\r\nsomething, Philip Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s hand must write at your dictation, and if,\r\nwhen written, I can sign it I will do so, but such a document as you say\r\nyou must have from me, I never can sign. I mean what I say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir, what\xe2\x80\x99s to be done must be done quickly, for I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here\r\nlong enough already. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put the thing in another shape (and then\r\npointing to the paper); don\xe2\x80\x99t you know those charges to be false?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know them to be true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf my own personal knowledge I do not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then did you print them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause rightly considered in their connection they are not charges,\r\nbut pertinent and useful suggestions in answer to the queries of a\r\ncorrespondent who stated facts which are inexplicable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that I know they are false?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do, the proper course is simply to deny them and court an\r\ninvestigation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do YOU claim the right to make ME come out and deny anything you\r\nmay choose to write and print?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo that question I think I made no reply, and he then further said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the matter long enough. I want your final\r\nanswer\xe2\x80\x94did you write that article or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot in honor tell you who wrote it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you not see it before it was printed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost certainly, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you deem it a fit thing to publish?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost assuredly, sir, or I would never have consented to its appearance.\r\nOf its authorship I can say nothing whatever, but for its publication I\r\nassume full, sole and personal responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you then retract it or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Winters, if my refusal to sign such a paper as you have demanded\r\nmust entail upon me all that your language in this room fairly implies,\r\nthen I ask a few minutes for prayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrayer!\xe2\x80\x94-you, this is not your hour for prayer\xe2\x80\x94your time to pray was\r\nwhen you were writing those\xe2\x80\x94lying charges. Will you sign or not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou already have my answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! do you still refuse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake that, then,\xe2\x80\x9d and to my amazement and inexpressible relief he drew\r\nonly a rawhide instead of what I expected\xe2\x80\x94a bludgeon or pistol. With it,\r\nas he spoke, he struck at my left ear downwards, as if to tear it off,\r\nand afterwards on the side of the head. As he moved away to get a better\r\nchance for a more effective shot, for the first time I gained a chance\r\nunder peril to rise, and I did so pitying him from the very bottom of my\r\nsoul, to think that one so naturally capable of true dignity, power and\r\nnobility could, by the temptations of this State, and by unfortunate\r\nassociations and aspirations, be so deeply debased as to find in such\r\nbrutality anything which he could call satisfaction\xe2\x80\x94but the great hope\r\nfor us all is in progress and growth, and John B. Winters, I trust, will\r\nyet be able to comprehend my feelings.\r\n\r\nHe continued to beat me with all his great force, until absolutely\r\nweary, exhausted and panting for breath. I still adhered to my purpose\r\nof non-aggressive defence, and made no other use of my arms than to\r\ndefend my head and face from further disfigurement. The mere pain\r\narising from the blows he inflicted upon my person was of course\r\ntransient, and my clothing to some extent deadened its severity, as it\r\nnow hides all remaining traces.\r\n\r\nWhen I supposed he was through, taking the butt end of his weapon and\r\nshaking it in my face, he warned me, if I correctly understood him, of\r\nmore yet to come, and furthermore said, if ever I again dared introduce\r\nhis name to print, in either my own or any other public journal, he\r\nwould cut off my left ear (and I do not think he was jesting) and send\r\nme home to my family a visibly mutilated man, to be a standing warning\r\nto all low-lived puppies who seek to blackmail gentlemen and to injure\r\ntheir good names. And when he did so operate, he informed me that his\r\nimplement would not be a whip but a knife.\r\n\r\nWhen he had said this, unaccompanied by Mr. Lynch, as I remember it, he\r\nleft the room, for I sat down by Mr. Lynch, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cThe man is\r\nmad\xe2\x80\x94he is utterly mad\xe2\x80\x94this step is his ruin\xe2\x80\x94it is a mistake\xe2\x80\x94it would be\r\nungenerous in me, despite of all the ill usage I have here received, to\r\nexpose him, at least until he has had an opportunity to reflect upon the\r\nmatter. I shall be in no haste.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWinters is very mad just now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Lynch, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when he is\r\nhimself he is one of the finest men I ever met. In fact, he told me the\r\nreason he did not meet you upstairs was to spare you the humiliation of\r\na beating in the sight of others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI submit that that unguarded remark of Philip Lynch convicts him of\r\nhaving been privy in advance to Mr. Winters\xe2\x80\x99 intentions whatever they\r\nmay have been, or at least to his meaning to make an assault upon me,\r\nbut I leave to others to determine how much censure an editor deserves\r\nfor inveigling a weak, non-combatant man, also a publisher, to a pen of\r\nhis own to be horsewhipped, if no worse, for the simple printing of what\r\nis verbally in the mouth of nine out of ten men, and women too, upon the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this account two theories have occurred to me as possibly\r\ntrue respecting this most remarkable assault: First\xe2\x80\x94The aim may have\r\nbeen simply to extort from me such admissions as in the hands of money\r\nand influence would have sent me to the Penitentiary for libel. This,\r\nhowever, seems unlikely, because any statements elicited by fear or\r\nforce could not be evidence in law or could be so explained as to have\r\nno force. The statements wanted so badly must have been desired for some\r\nother purpose. Second\xe2\x80\x94The other theory has so dark and wilfully\r\nmurderous a look that I shrink from writing it, yet as in all\r\nprobability my death at the earliest practicable moment has already been\r\ndecreed, I feel I should do all I can before my hour arrives, at least\r\nto show others how to break up that aristocratic rule and combination\r\nwhich has robbed all Nevada of true freedom, if not of manhood itself.\r\nAlthough I do not prefer this hypothesis as a \xe2\x80\x9ccharge,\xe2\x80\x9d I feel that as\r\nan American citizen I still have a right both to think and to speak my\r\nthoughts even in the land of Sharon and Winters, and as much so\r\nrespecting the theory of a brutal assault (especially when I have been\r\nits subject) as respecting any other apparent enormity. I give the\r\nmatter simply as a suggestion which may explain to the proper\r\nauthorities and to the people whom they should represent, a well\r\nascertained but notwithstanding a darkly mysterious fact. The scheme of\r\nthe assault may have been:\r\n\r\nFirst\xe2\x80\x94To terrify me by making me conscious of my own helplessness after\r\nmaking actual though not legal threats against my life.\r\n\r\nSecond\xe2\x80\x94To imply that I could save my life only by writing or signing\r\ncertain specific statements which if not subsequently explained would\r\neternally have branded me as infamous and would have consigned my family\r\nto shame and want, and to the dreadful compassion and patronage of the\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nThird\xe2\x80\x94To blow my brains out the moment I had signed, thereby preventing\r\nme from making any subsequent explanation such as could remove the\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\nFourth\xe2\x80\x94Philip Lynch to be compelled to testify that I was killed by John\r\nB. Winters in self-defence, for the conviction of Winters would bring\r\nhim in as an accomplice. If that was the programme in John B. Winters\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmind nothing saved my life but my persistent refusal to sign, when that\r\nrefusal seemed clearly to me to be the choice of death.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable assertion made to me by Mr. Winters, that pity only\r\nspared my life on Wednesday evening last, almost compels me to believe\r\nthat at first he could not have intended me to leave that room alive;\r\nand why I was allowed to, unless through mesmeric or some other\r\ninvisible influence, I cannot divine. The more I reflect upon this\r\nmatter, the more probable as true does this horrible interpretation\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nThe narration of these things I might have spared both to Mr. Winters\r\nand to the public had he himself observed silence, but as he has both\r\nverbally spoken and suffered a thoroughly garbled statement of facts to\r\nappear in the Gold Hill News I feel it due to myself no less than to\r\nthis community, and to the entire independent press of America and Great\r\nBritain, to give a true account of what even the Gold Hill News has\r\npronounced a disgraceful affair, and which it deeply regrets because of\r\nsome alleged telegraphic mistake in the account of it. [Who received the\r\nerroneous telegrams?]\r\n\r\nThough he may not deem it prudent to take my life just now, the\r\npublication of this article I feel sure must compel Gen. Winters (with\r\nhis peculiar views about his right to exemption from criticism by me) to\r\nresolve on my violent death, though it may take years to compass it.\r\nNotwithstanding I bear him no ill will; and if W. C. Ralston and William\r\nSharon, and other members of the San Francisco mining and milling Ring\r\nfeel that he above all other men in this State and California is the\r\nmost fitting man to supervise and control Yellow Jacket matters, until I\r\nam able to vote more than half their stock I presume he will be retained\r\nto grace his present post.\r\n\r\nMeantime, I cordially invite all who know of any sort of important\r\nvillainy which only can be cured by exposure (and who would expose it if\r\nthey felt sure they would not be betrayed under bullying threats), to\r\ncommunicate with the PEOPLE\xe2\x80\x99S TRIBUNE; for until I am murdered, so long\r\nas I can raise the means to publish, I propose to continue my efforts at\r\nleast to revive the liberties of the State, to curb oppression, and to\r\nbenefit man\xe2\x80\x99s world and God\xe2\x80\x99s earth.\r\n\r\nCONRAD WIEGAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[It does seem a pity that the Sheriff was shut out, since the good sense\r\nof a general of militia and of a prominent editor failed to teach them\r\nthat the merited castigation of this weak, half-witted child was a thing\r\nthat ought to have been done in the street, where the poor thing could\r\nhave a chance to run. When a journalist maligns a citizen, or attacks\r\nhis good name on hearsay evidence, he deserves to be thrashed for it,\r\neven if he is a \xe2\x80\x9cnon-combatant\xe2\x80\x9d weakling; but a generous adversary would\r\nat least allow such a lamb the use of his legs at such a time.\xe2\x80\x94M.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
