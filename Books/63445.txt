It was my first novel; I\r\nwrote it without any fixed plan, having no theory of art or philosophy\r\nin my mind. I was at the age when one writes with one\'s instincts, and\r\nwhen reflection serves only to confirm our natural tendencies. Some\r\npeople chose to see in the book a deliberate argument against marriage.\r\nI was not so ambitious, and I was surprised to the last degree at all\r\nthe fine things that the critics found to say concerning my subversive\r\npurposes. Criticism is far too acute; that is what will cause its death.\r\nIt never passes judgment ingenuously on what has been done ingenuously.\r\nIt looks for noon at four o\'clock, as the old women say, and must cause\r\nmuch suffering to artists who care more for its decrees than they ought\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nUnder all r\xc3\xa9gimes and in all times there has been a race of critics,\r\nwho, in contempt of their own talent, have fancied that it was their\r\nduty to ply the trade of denouncers, of purveyors to the prosecuting\r\nattorney\'s office; extraordinary functions for men of letters to assume\r\nwith regard to their confr\xc3\xa8res! The rigorous measures of government\r\nagainst the press never satisfy these savage critics. They would have\r\nthem directed not only against works but against persons as well, and,\r\nif their advice were followed, some of us would be forbidden to write\r\nanything whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAt the time that I wrote _Indiana_, the cry of Saint Simonism was raised\r\non every pretext. Later they shouted all sorts of other things. Even now\r\ncertain writers are forbidden to open their mouths, under pain of seeing\r\nthe police agents of certain newspapers pounce upon their work and hale\r\nthem before the police of the constituted powers. If a writer puts noble\r\nsentiments in the mouth of a mechanic, it is an attack on the\r\nbourgeoisie; if a girl who has gone astray is rehabilitated after\r\nexpiating her sin, it is an attack on virtuous women; if an impostor\r\nassumes titles of nobility, it is an attack on the patrician caste; if a\r\nbully plays the swashbuckling soldier, it is an insult to the army; if a\r\nwoman is maltreated by her husband, it is an argument in favor of\r\npromiscuous love. And so with everything. Kindly brethren, devout and\r\ngenerous critics! What a pity that no one thinks of creating a petty\r\ncourt of literary inquisition in which you should be the torturers!\r\nWould you be satisfied to tear the books to pieces and burn them at a\r\nslow fire, and could you not, by your urgent representations, obtain\r\npermission to give a little taste of the rack to those writers who\r\npresume to have other gods than yours?\r\n\r\nThank God, I have forgotten the names of those who tried to discourage\r\nme at my first appearance, and who, being unable to say that my first\r\nattempt had fallen completely flat, tried to distort it into an\r\nincendiary proclamation against the repose of society. I did not expect\r\nso much honor, and I consider that I owe to those critics the thanks\r\nwhich the hare proffered the frogs, imagining from their alarm that he\r\nwas entitled to deem himself a very thunderbolt of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\nNohant, May, 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1832\r\n\r\n\r\nIf certain pages of this book should incur the serious reproach of\r\ntending toward novel beliefs, if unbending judges shall consider their\r\ntone imprudent and perilous, I should be obliged to reply to the\r\ncriticism that it does too much honor to a work of no importance; that,\r\nin order to attack the great questions of social order, one must either\r\nbe conscious of great strength of purpose or pride one\'s self upon great\r\ntalent, and that such presumption is altogether foreign to a very simple\r\ntale, in which the author has invented almost nothing. If, in the course\r\nof his task, he has happened to set forth the lamentations extorted from\r\nhis characters by the social malady with which they were assailed; if he\r\nhas not shrunk from recording their aspirations after a happier\r\nexistence, let the blame be laid upon society for its inequalities, upon\r\ndestiny for its caprices! The author is merely a mirror which reflects\r\nthem, a machine which reverses their tracing, and he has no reason for\r\nself-reproach if the impression is exact, if the reflection is true.\r\n\r\nConsider further that the narrator has not taken for text or devise a\r\nfew shrieks of suffering and wrath scattered through the drama of human\r\nlife. He does not claim to conceal serious instruction beneath the\r\nexterior form of a tale; it is not his aim to lend a hand in\r\nconstructing the edifice which a doubtful future is preparing for us and\r\nto give a sly kick at that of the past which is crumbling away. He knows\r\ntoo well that we live in an epoch of moral deterioration, wherein the\r\nreason of mankind has need of curtains to soften the too bright glare\r\nwhich dazzles it. If he had felt sufficiently learned to write a\r\ngenuinely useful book, he would have toned down the truth, instead of\r\npresenting it in its crude tints and with its startling effects. That\r\nbook would have performed the functions of blue spectacles for weak\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe does not abandon the idea of performing that honorable and laudable\r\ntask some day; but, being still a young man, he simply tells you to-day\r\nwhat he has seen, not presuming to draw his conclusions concerning the\r\ngreat controversy between the future and the past, which perhaps no man\r\nof the present generation is especially competent to do. Too\r\nconscientious to conceal his doubts from you, but too timid to transform\r\nthem into certainties, he relies upon your reflections and abstains from\r\nweaving into the woof of his narrative preconceived opinions, judgments\r\nall formed. He plies with exactitude his trade of narrator. He will tell\r\nyou everything, even painful truths; but, if you should wrap him in the\r\nphilosopher\'s robe, you would find that he was exceedingly confused,\r\nsimple story-teller that he is, whose mission is to amuse and not to\r\ninstruct.\r\n\r\nEven were he more mature and more skilful, he would not dare to lay his\r\nhand upon the great sores of dying civilization. One must be so sure of\r\nbeing able to cure them when one ventures to probe them! He would much\r\nprefer to arouse your interest in old discarded beliefs, in\r\nold-fashioned, vanished forms of devotion, to employing his talent, if\r\nhe had any, in blasting overturned altars. He knows, however, that, in\r\nthese charitable times, a timorous conscience is despised by public\r\nopinion as hypocritical reserve, just as, in the arts, a timid bearing\r\nis sneered at as an absurd mannerism; but he knows also that there is\r\nhonor, if not profit, in defending lost causes.\r\n\r\nTo him who should misunderstand the spirit of this book, such a\r\nprofession of faith would sound like an anachronism. The narrator hopes\r\nthat few auditors, after listening to his tale to the end, will deny the\r\nmoral to be derived from the facts, a moral which triumphs there as in\r\nall human affairs; it seemed to him, when he wrote the last line, that\r\nhis conscience was clear. He flattered himself, in a word, that he had\r\ndescribed social miseries without too much bitterness, human passions\r\nwithout too much passion. He placed the mute under his strings when they\r\nechoed too loudly; he tried to stifle certain notes of the soul which\r\nshould remain mute, certain voices of the heart which cannot be awakened\r\nwithout danger.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will do him justice if you agree that the being who tries to\r\nfree himself from his lawful curb is represented as very wretched\r\nindeed, and the heart that rebels against the decrees of its destiny as\r\nin sore distress. If he has not given the best imaginable r\xc3\xb4le to that\r\none of his characters who represents _the law_, if that one who\r\nrepresents _opinion_ is even less cheerful, you will see a third\r\nrepresenting _illusion_, who cruelly thwarts the vain hopes and\r\nenterprises of passion. Lastly, you will see that, although he has not\r\nstrewn rose-leaves on the ground where the law pens up our desires like\r\na sheep\'s appetite, he has scattered thistles along the roads which lead\r\nus away from it.\r\n\r\nThese facts, it seems to me, are sufficient to protect this book from\r\nthe reproach of immorality; but, if you absolutely insist that a novel\r\nshould end like one of Marmontel\'s tales, you will perhaps chide me on\r\naccount of the last pages; you will think that I have done wrong in not\r\ncasting into misery and destitution the character who has transgressed\r\nthe laws of mankind through two volumes. In this regard, the author will\r\nreply that before being moral he chose to be true; he will say again,\r\nthat, feeling that he was too new to the trade to compose a\r\nphilosophical treatise on the manner of enduring life, he has restricted\r\nhimself to telling you the story of _Indiana_, a story of the human\r\nheart, with its weaknesses, its passions, its rights and its wrongs, its\r\ngood qualities and its evil qualities.\r\n\r\nIndiana, if you insist upon an explanation of every thing in the book,\r\nis a type; she is woman, the feeble being whose mission it is to\r\nrepresent _passions_ repressed, or, if you prefer, suppressed by _the\r\nlaw_; she is desire at odds with necessity; she is love dashing her head\r\nblindly against all the obstacles of civilization. But the serpent wears\r\nout his teeth and breaks them in trying to gnaw a file; the powers of\r\nthe soul become exhausted in trying to struggle against the positive\r\nfacts of life. That is the conclusion you may draw from this tale, and\r\nit was in that light that it was told to him who transmits it to you.\r\n\r\nBut despite these protestations the narrator anticipates reproaches.\r\nSome upright souls, some honest men\'s consciences will be alarmed\r\nperhaps to see virtue so harsh, reason so downcast, opinion so unjust.\r\nHe is dismayed at the prospect; for the thing that an author should fear\r\nmore than anything in the world is the alienating from his works the\r\nconfidence of good men, the awakening of an ominous sympathy in\r\nembittered souls, the inflaming of the sores, already too painful, which\r\nare made by the social yoke upon impatient and rebellious necks.\r\n\r\nThe success which is based upon an unworthy appeal to the passions of\r\nthe age is the easiest to win, the least honorable to strive for. The\r\nhistorian of _Indiana_ denies that he has ever dreamed of it; if he\r\nthought that he had reached that result, he would destroy his book, even\r\nthough he felt for it the artless fatherly affection which swaddles the\r\nrickety offspring of these days of literary abortions.\r\n\r\nBut he hopes to justify himself by stating that he thought it better to\r\nenforce his principles by real examples than by poetic fancies. He\r\nbelieves that his tale, with the depressing atmosphere of frankness that\r\nenvelopes it, may make an impression upon young and ardent brains. They\r\nwill find it difficult to distrust a historian who forces his way\r\nbrutally through the midst of facts, elbowing right and left, with no\r\nmore regard for one camp than for the other. To make a cause odious or\r\nabsurd is to persecute it, not to combat it. It may be that the whole\r\nart of the novelist consists in interesting the culprits whom he wishes\r\nto redeem, the wretched whom he wishes to cure, in their own story.\r\n\r\nIt would be giving overmuch importance to a work that is destined\r\ndoubtless to attract very little notice, to seek to protect it against\r\nevery sort of accusation. Therefore the author surrenders\r\nunconditionally to the critics; a single charge seems to him too serious\r\nto accept, and that is the charge that he has written a dangerous book.\r\nHe would prefer to remain in a humble position forever to building his\r\nreputation upon a ruined conscience. He will add a word therefore to\r\nrepel the blame which he most dreads.\r\n\r\nRaymon, you will say, is society; egoism is substituted for morality and\r\nreason. Raymon, the author will reply, is the false reason, the false\r\nmorality by which society is governed; he is the man of honor as the\r\nworld understands the phrase, because the world does not examine closely\r\nenough to see everything. The good man you have beside Raymon; and you\r\nwill not say that he is the enemy of order; for he sacrifices his\r\nhappiness, he loses all thought of self before all questions of social\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThen you will say that virtue is not rewarded with sufficient blowing of\r\ntrumpets. Alas! the answer is that we no longer witness the triumph of\r\nvirtue elsewhere than at the boulevard theatres. The author will tell\r\nyou that he has undertaken to exhibit society to you, not as virtuous,\r\nbut as necessary, and that honor has become as difficult as heroism in\r\nthese days of moral degeneration. Do you think that this truth will\r\ncause great souls to loathe honor? I think just the opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1842\r\n\r\n\r\nIn allowing the foregoing pages to be reprinted, I do not mean to imply\r\nthat they form a clear and complete summary of the beliefs which I hold\r\nto-day concerning the rights of society over individuals. I do it simply\r\nbecause I regard opinions freely put forth in the past as something\r\nsacred, which we should neither retract nor cry down nor attempt to\r\ninterpret as our fancy directs. But to-day, having advanced on life\'s\r\nhighway and watched the horizon broaden around me, I deem it my duty to\r\ntell the reader what I think of my book.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote _Indiana_, I was young; I acted in obedience to feelings of\r\ngreat strength and sincerity which overflowed thereafter in a series of\r\nnovels, almost all of which were based on the same idea: the ill-defined\r\nrelations between the sexes, attributable to the constitution of our\r\nsociety. These novels were all more or less inveighed against by the\r\ncritics, as making unwise assaults upon the institution of marriage.\r\n_Indiana_, notwithstanding the narrowness of its scope and the ingenuous\r\nuncertainty of its grasp, did not escape the indignation of several\r\nself-styled serious minds, whom I was strongly disposed at that time to\r\nbelieve upon their simple statement and to listen to with docility. But,\r\nalthough my reasoning powers were developed hardly enough to write upon\r\nso grave a subject, I was not so much of a child that I could not pass\r\njudgment in my turn on the thoughts of those persons who passed judgment\r\non mine. However simple-minded a man accused of crime may be and however\r\nshrewd the magistrate, the accused has enough common-sense to know\r\nwhether the magistrate\'s sentence is equitable or inequitable, wise or\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nCertain journalists of our day who set themselves up as representatives\r\nand guardians of public morals--I know not by virtue of what\r\nmission they act, since I know not by what faith they are\r\ncommissioned--pronounced judgment pitilessly against my poor tale, and,\r\nby representing it as an argument against social order, gave it an\r\nimportance and a sort of echo which it would not otherwise have\r\nobtained. They thereby imposed a very serious and weighty r\xc3\xb4le upon a\r\nyoung author hardly initiated in the most elementary social ideas, whose\r\nwhole literary and philosophical baggage consisted of a little\r\nimagination, courage and love of the truth. Sensitive to the reproofs\r\nand almost grateful for the lessons which they were pleased to\r\nadminister, he examined the arguments which arraigned the moral\r\ncharacter of his thoughts before the bar of public opinion, and, by\r\nvirtue of that examination, which he conducted entirely without pride,\r\nhe gradually acquired convictions which were mere feelings at the outset\r\nof his career and which to-day are fundamental principles.\r\n\r\nDuring ten years of investigations, of scruples, and of irresolution,\r\noften painful but always sincere, shunning the r\xc3\xb4le of pedagogue which\r\nsome attributed to me to make me ridiculous, abhorring the imputation of\r\npride and spleen with which others pursued me to make me odious,\r\nproceeding according to the measure of my artistic faculties, to seek\r\nthe synthesis of life by analyzing it, I related facts which have\r\nsometimes been acknowledged to be plausible, and drew characters which\r\nhave often been described as having been studied with care. I restricted\r\nmyself to that, striving to establish my own conviction rather than to\r\nshake other people\'s, and saying to myself that, if I were mistaken,\r\nsociety would find no lack of loud voices to overturn my arguments and\r\nto repair by judicious answers the evil that my imprudent questions\r\nmight have done. Numerous voices did, in fact, arise to put the public\r\non its guard against the dangerous writer, but, as for the judicious\r\nanswers, the public and the author are still awaiting them.\r\n\r\nA long while after I wrote the preface to _Indiana_ under the influence\r\nof a remnant of respect for constituted society, I was still seeking to\r\nsolve this insoluble problem: _the method of reconciling the welfare and\r\nthe dignity of individuals oppressed by that same society without\r\nmodifying society itself._ Leaning over the victims and mingling his\r\ntears with theirs, making himself their interpreter with his readers,\r\nbut, like a prudent advocate, not striving overmuch to palliate the\r\nwrong-doing of his clients, and addressing himself to the clemency of\r\nthe judges rather than to their austerity, the novelist is really the\r\nadvocate of the abstract beings who represent our passions and our\r\nsufferings before the tribunal of superior force and the jury of public\r\nopinion. It is a task which has a gravity of its own beneath its trivial\r\nexterior, and a task which it is exceedingly difficult to confine to its\r\ntrue path, pestered as you are at every step by those who accuse you of\r\nbeing too serious in respect to form and by those who accuse you of\r\nbeing too frivolous in respect to substance.\r\n\r\nI do not flatter myself that I performed this task skilfully; but I am\r\nsure that I attempted it in all seriousness, amid inward hesitations\r\nwherein my conscience, sometimes dismayed by its ignorance of its\r\nrights, sometimes inspired by a heart enamored of justice and truth,\r\nmarched forward to its goal, without swerving too far from the straight\r\nroad and without too many backward steps.\r\n\r\nTo enlighten the public as to this inward struggle by a series of\r\nprefaces and discussions would have been a puerile method, wherein the\r\nvanity of talking about one\'s self would have taken too much space to\r\nsuit me. I could but abstain from it as well as from touching too\r\nhastily upon the points which were still obscure in my mind.\r\nConservators called me too bold, innovators too timid. I confess that I\r\nhad respect and sympathy for the past and the future alike, and in the\r\nbattle I found no peace of mind until the day when I fully realized that\r\nthe one should not be the violation and the annihilation of the other,\r\nbut its continuation and development.\r\n\r\nAfter this novitiate of ten years, being initiated at last in broader\r\nideas which I derived not from myself but from the philosophical\r\nprogress which had taken place around me--and particularly from a few\r\nvast intellects which I religiously questioned, and, generally speaking,\r\nfrom the spectacle of the sufferings of my fellowmen,--I realized at\r\nlast that, although I may have done well to distrust myself and to\r\nhesitate to put forth my views at the epoch of ignorance and\r\ninexperience when I wrote _Indiana_, my present duty is to congratulate\r\nmyself on the bold utterances to which I allowed myself to be impelled\r\nthen and afterwards; bold utterances for which I have been reproached so\r\nbitterly, and which would have been bolder still had I known how\r\nlegitimate and honest and sacred they were.\r\n\r\nTo-day therefore, having re-read the first novel of my youth with as\r\nmuch severity and impartiality as if it were the work of another person,\r\non the eve of giving it a publicity which it has not yet derived from\r\nthe popular edition, having resolved beforehand not to retract--one\r\nshould never retract what was said or done in good faith--but to condemn\r\nmyself if I should discover that my former tendencies were mistaken or\r\ndangerous, I find myself so entirely in accord with myself with respect\r\nto the sentiment which dictated _Indiana_ and which would dictate it now\r\nif I had that story to tell to-day for the first time, that I have not\r\nchosen to change anything in it save a few ungrammatical sentences and\r\nsome inappropriate words. Doubtless many more of the same sort remain,\r\nand the literary merits of my writings I submit without reserve to the\r\nanimadversions of the critics; I gladly accord to them all the\r\ncompetence in that regard which I myself lack. That there is an\r\nincontestable mass of talent in the daily press of the present day, I do\r\nnot deny and I delight to acknowledge it. But that there are many\r\nphilosophers and moralists in this array of polished writers, I do\r\npositively deny, with due respect to those who have condemned me, and\r\nwho will condemn me again on the first opportunity, from their lofty\r\nplane of morality and philosophy.\r\n\r\nI repeat then, I wrote _Indiana_, and I was justified in writing it; I\r\nyielded to an overpowering instinct of outcry and rebellion which God\r\nhad implanted in me, God who makes nothing that is not of some use, even\r\nthe most insignificant creatures, and who interposes in the most trivial\r\nas well as in great causes. But what am I saying? is this cause that I\r\nam defending so very trivial, pray? It is the cause of half of the human\r\nrace, nay, of the whole human race; for the unhappiness of woman\r\ninvolves that of man, as that of the slave involves that of the master,\r\nand I strove to demonstrate it in _Indiana._ Some persons said that I\r\nwas pleading the cause of an individual; as if, even assuming that I was\r\ninspired by personal feeling, I was the only unhappy mortal in this\r\npeaceful and radiant human race! So many cries of pain and sympathy\r\nanswered mine that I know now what to think concerning the supreme\r\nfelicity of my fellowman.\r\n\r\nI do not think that I have ever written anything under the influence of\r\na selfish passion; I have never even thought of avoiding it. They who\r\nhave read me without prejudice understand that I wrote _Indiana_ with a\r\nfeeling, not deliberately reasoned out, to be sure, but a deep and\r\ngenuine feeling that the laws which still govern woman\'s existence in\r\nwedlock, in the family and in society are unjust and barbarous. I had\r\nnot to write a treatise on jurisprudence but to fight against public\r\nopinion; for it is that which postpones or advances social reforms. The\r\nwar will be long and bitter; but I am neither the first nor the last nor\r\nthe only champion of so noble a cause, and I will defend it so long as\r\nthe breath of life remains in my body.\r\n\r\nThis feeling which inspired me at the beginning I reasoned out and\r\ndeveloped as it was combated and reproved. Unjust and malevolent critics\r\ntaught me much more than I should have discovered in the calm of\r\nimpunity. For this reason therefore I offer thanks to the bungling\r\njudges who enlightened me. The motives that inspired their judgments\r\ncast a bright light upon my mind and enveloped my conscience in a sense\r\nof profound security. A sincere mind turns everything to advantage, and\r\nfacts that would discourage vanity redouble the ardor of genuine\r\ndevotion.\r\n\r\nLet no one look upon the reproof which, from the depths of a heart that\r\nis to-day serious and tranquil, I have just addressed to the majority of\r\njournalists of my time, as implying even a suggestion of protest against\r\nthe right of censorship with which public morality invests the French\r\npress. That criticism often ill performs and ill comprehends its mission\r\nin the society of the present day, is evident to all; but that the\r\nmission is in itself providential and sacred, no one can deny unless he\r\nbe an atheist in the matter of progress, unless he be an enemy of the\r\ntruth, a blasphemer of the future and an unworthy child of France!\r\nLiberty of thought, liberty to write and to speak, blessed conquest of\r\nthe human mind! what are the petty sufferings and the fleeting cares\r\nengendered by thy errors or abuses compared to the infinite blessings\r\nwhich thou hast in store for the world!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANA\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIRST\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a certain cool, rainy evening in autumn, in a small ch\xc3\xa2teau in Brie,\r\nthree pensive individuals were gravely occupied in watching the wood\r\nburn on the hearth and the hands of the clock move slowly around the\r\ndial. Two of these silent guests seemed to give way unreservedly to the\r\nvague ennui that weighed upon them; but the third gave signs of open\r\nrebellion: he fidgeted about on his seat, stifled half audibly divers\r\nmelancholy yawns, and tapped the snapping sticks with the tongs, with a\r\nmanifest intention of resisting the common enemy.\r\n\r\nThis person, who was much older than the other two, was the master of\r\nthe house, Colonel Delmare, an old warrior on half-pay, once a very\r\nhandsome man, now over-corpulent, with a bald head, gray moustache and\r\nawe-inspiring eye; an excellent master before whom everybody trembled,\r\nwife, servants, horses and dogs.\r\n\r\nAt last he left his chair, evidently vexed because he did not know how\r\nto break the silence, and began to walk heavily up and down the whole\r\nlength of the salon, without laying aside for an instant the rigidity\r\nwhich characterizes all the movements of an ex-soldier, resting his\r\nweight on his loins and turning the whole body at once, with the\r\nunfailing self-satisfaction peculiar to the man of show and the model\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nBut the glorious days had passed, when Lieutenant Delmare inhaled\r\ntriumph with the air of the camps; the retired officer, forgotten now by\r\nan ungrateful country, was condemned to undergo all the consequences of\r\nmarriage. He was the husband of a young and pretty wife, the proprietor\r\nof a commodious manor with its appurtenances, and, furthermore, a\r\nmanufacturer who had been fortunate in his undertakings; in consequence\r\nwhereof the colonel was ill-humored, especially on the evening in\r\nquestion; for it was very damp, and the colonel had rheumatism.\r\n\r\nHe paced gravely up and down his old salon, furnished in the style of\r\nLouis XV., halting sometimes before a door surmounted by nude Cupids in\r\nfresco, who led in chains of flowers well-bred fawns and good-natured\r\nwild boars; sometimes before a panel overladen with paltry,\r\nover-elaborated sculpture, whose tortuous vagaries and endless\r\nintertwining the eye would have wearied itself to no purpose in\r\nattempting to follow. But these vague and fleeting distractions did not\r\nprevent the colonel, whenever he turned about, from casting a keen and\r\nsearching glance at the two companions of his silent vigil, resting upon\r\nthem alternately that watchful eye which for three years past had been\r\nstanding guard over a fragile and priceless treasure, his wife.\r\n\r\nFor his wife was nineteen years of age; and if you had seen her buried\r\nunder the mantel of that huge fire-place of white marble inlaid with\r\nburnished copper; if you had seen her, slender, pale, depressed, with\r\nher elbow resting on her knee, a mere child in that ancient household,\r\nbeside that old husband, like a flower of yesterday that had bloomed in\r\na gothic vase, you would have pitied Colonel Delmare\'s wife, and the\r\ncolonel even more perhaps than his wife.\r\n\r\nThe third occupant of this lonely house was also sitting under the same\r\nmantel, at the other end of the burning log. He was a man in all the\r\nstrength and all the bloom of youth, whose glowing cheeks, abundant\r\ngolden hair and full whiskers presented a striking contrast to the\r\ngrizzly hair, weather-beaten complexion and harsh countenance of the\r\nmaster of the house; but the least _artistic_ of men would none the less\r\nhave preferred Monsieur Delmare\'s harsh and stern expression to the\r\nyounger man\'s regular but insipid features. The bloated face carved in\r\nrelief on the sheet of iron that formed the back of the fire-place, with\r\nits eye fixed constantly on the burning logs, was less monotonous\r\nperhaps than the pink and white fair-haired character in this narrative,\r\nabsorbed in like contemplation. However, his strong and supple figure,\r\nthe clean-cut outline of his brown eyebrows, the polished whiteness of\r\nhis forehead, the tranquil expression of his limpid eyes, the beauty of\r\nhis hands, and even the rigorously correct elegance of his hunting\r\ncostume, would have caused him to be considered a very comely _cavalier_\r\nin the eyes of any woman who had conceived a passion for the so-called\r\n_philosophic_ tastes of another century. But perhaps Monsieur Delmare\'s\r\nyoung and timid wife had never as yet examined a man with her eyes;\r\nperhaps there was an entire absence of sympathy between that pale and\r\nunhappy woman and that sound sleeper and hearty eater. Certain it is\r\nthat the conjugal Argus wearied his hawklike eye without detecting a\r\nglance, a breath, a palpitation, between these two very dissimilar\r\nbeings. Thereupon, being assured that he had not the slightest pretext\r\nfor jealousy to occupy his mind, he relapsed into a state of depression\r\nmore profound than before, and abruptly plunged his hands into his\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nThe only cheerful and attractive face in the group was that of a\r\nbeautiful hunting dog, of the large breed of pointers, whose head was\r\nresting on the knees of the younger man. She was remarkable by reason of\r\nher long body, her powerful hairy legs, her muzzle, slender as a fox\'s,\r\nand her intelligent face, covered with disheveled hair, through which\r\ntwo great tawny eyes shone like topazes. Those dog\'s eyes, so fierce and\r\nthreatening during the chase, had at that moment an indefinable\r\nexpression of affectionate melancholy; and when her master, the object\r\nof that instinctive love, sometimes so superior to the deliberate\r\naffection of man, ran his fingers through the beautiful creature\'s silky\r\nsilver locks, her eyes sparkled with pleasure, while her long tail swept\r\nthe hearth in regular cadence, and scattered the ashes over the inlaid\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nIt was a fitting subject for Rembrandt\'s brush, that interior, dimly\r\nlighted by the fire on the hearth. At intervals fugitive white gleams\r\nlighted up the room and the faces, then, changing to the red tint of the\r\nembers, gradually died away; the gloom of the salon varying as the\r\nfitful gleams grew more or less dull. Each time that Monsieur Delmare\r\npassed in front of the fire, he suddenly appeared, like a ghost, then\r\nvanished in the mysterious depths of the salon. Strips of gilding stood\r\nforth in the light now and then on the oval frames, adorned with wreaths\r\nand medallions and fillets of wood, on furniture, inlaid with ebony and\r\ncopper, and even on the jagged cornices of the wainscoting. But when a\r\nbrand went out, resigning its brilliancy to some other blazing point,\r\nthe objects which had been in the light a moment before withdrew into\r\nthe shadow, and other projections stood forth from the obscurity. Thus\r\none could have grasped in due time all the details of the picture, from\r\nthe console supported by three huge gilded tritons, to the frescoed\r\nceiling, representing a sky studded with stars and clouds, and to the\r\nheavy hangings of crimson damask, with long tassels, which shimmered\r\nlike satin, their ample folds seeming to sway back and forth as they\r\nreflected the flickering light.\r\n\r\nOne would have said, from the immobility of the two figures in bold\r\nrelief before the fire, that they feared to disturb the immobility of\r\nthe scene; that they had been turned to stone where they sat, like the\r\nheroes of a fairy tale, and that the slightest word or movement would\r\nbring the walls of an imaginary city crumbling about their ears. And the\r\ndark-browed master, who alone broke the silence and the shadow with his\r\nregular tread, seemed a magician who held them under a spell.\r\n\r\nAt last the dog, having obtained a smile from her master, yielded to the\r\nmagnetic power which the eye of man exerts over that of the lower\r\nanimals. She uttered a low whine of timid affection and placed her fore\r\npaws on her beloved\'s shoulders with inimitable ease and grace of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n"Down, Ophelia, down!"\r\n\r\nAnd the young man reproved the docile creature sternly in English,\r\nwhereupon she crawled toward Madame Delmare, shamefaced and repentant,\r\nas if to implore her protection. But Madame Delmare did not emerge from\r\nher reverie, and allowed Ophelia\'s head to rest on her two white hands,\r\nas they lay clasped on her knee, without bestowing a caress upon her.\r\n\r\n"Has that dog taken up her quarters in the salon for good?" said the\r\ncolonel, secretly well-pleased to find a pretext for an outburst of\r\nill-humor, to pass the time. "Be off to your kennel, Ophelia! Come, out\r\nwith you, you stupid beast!"\r\n\r\nIf anyone had been watching Madame Delmare closely he could have\r\ndivined, in that trivial and commonplace incident of her private life,\r\nthe painful secret of her whole existence. An imperceptible shudder ran\r\nover her body, and her hands, in which she unconsciously held the\r\nfavorite animal\'s head, closed nervously around her rough, hairy neck,\r\nas if to detain her and protect her. Whereupon Monsieur Delmare, drawing\r\nhis hunting-crop from the pocket of his jacket, walked with a\r\nthreatening air toward poor Ophelia, who crouched at his feet, closing\r\nher eyes, and whining with grief and fear in anticipation. Madame\r\nDelmare became even paler than usual; her bosom heaved convulsively,\r\nand, turning her great blue eyes upon her husband with an indescribable\r\nexpression of terror, she said:\r\n\r\n"In pity\'s name, monsieur, do not kill her!"\r\n\r\nThese few words gave the colonel a shock. A feeling of chagrin took the\r\nplace of his angry impulse.\r\n\r\n"That, madame, is a reproof which I understand very well," he said, "and\r\nwhich you have never spared me since the day that I killed your spaniel\r\nin a moment of passion while hunting. He was a great loss, was he not? A\r\ndog that was forever forcing the hunting and rushing after the game!\r\nWhose patience would he not have exhausted? Indeed, you were not nearly\r\nso fond of him until he was dead; before that you paid little attention\r\nto him; but now that he gives you a pretext for blaming me--"\r\n\r\n"Have I ever reproached you?" said Madame Delmare in the gentle tone\r\nwhich we adopt from a generous impulse with those we love, and from\r\nself-esteem with those whom we do not love.\r\n\r\n"I did not say that you had," rejoined the colonel in a half-paternal,\r\nhalf-conjugal tone; "but the tears of some women contain bitterer\r\nreproaches than the fiercest imprecations of others. _Morbleu!_ madame,\r\nyou know perfectly well that I hate to see people weeping about me."\r\n\r\n"I do not think that you ever see me weep."\r\n\r\n"Even so! don\'t I constantly see you with red eyes? On my word, that\'s\r\neven worse!"\r\n\r\nDuring this conjugal colloquy the young man had risen and put Ophelia\r\nout of the room with the greatest tranquillity; then he returned to his\r\nseat opposite Madame Delmare after lighting a candle and placing it on\r\nthe chimney-piece.\r\n\r\nThis act, dictated purely by chance, exerted a sudden influence upon\r\nMonsieur Delmare\'s frame of mind. As soon as the light of the candle,\r\nwhich was more uniform and steadier than that of the fire, fell upon his\r\nwife, he observed the symptoms of suffering and general prostration\r\nwhich were manifest that evening in her whole person: in her weary\r\nattitude, in the long brown hair falling over her emaciated cheeks and\r\nin the purple rings beneath her dull, inflamed eyes. He took several\r\nturns up and down the room, then returned to his wife and, suddenly\r\nchanging his tone:\r\n\r\n"How do you feel to-day, Indiana?" he said, with the stupidity of a man\r\nwhose heart and temperament are rarely in accord.\r\n\r\n"About as usual, thank you," she replied, with no sign of surprise or\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n"\'As usual\' is no answer at all, or rather it\'s a woman\'s answer; a\r\nNorman answer, that means neither yes nor no, neither well nor ill."\r\n\r\n"Very good; I am neither well nor ill."\r\n\r\n"I say that you lie," he retorted with renewed roughness; "I know that\r\nyou are not well; you have told Sir Ralph here that you are not. Tell\r\nme, isn\'t that the truth? Did she not tell you so, Monsieur Ralph?"\r\n\r\n"She did," replied the phlegmatic individual addressed, paying no heed\r\nto the reproachful glance which Indiana bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a fourth person entered the room: it was the factotum of\r\nthe household, formerly a sergeant in Monsieur Delmare\'s regiment.\r\n\r\nHe explained briefly to Monsieur Delmare that he had his reasons for\r\nbelieving that charcoal thieves had been in the park the last few nights\r\nat the same hour, and that he had come to ask for a gun to take with him\r\nin making his nightly round before locking the gates. Monsieur Delmare,\r\nscenting powder in the adventure, at once took down his fowling-piece,\r\ngave Leli\xc3\xa8vre another, and started to leave the room.\r\n\r\n"What!" said Madame Delmare in dismay, "you would kill a poor peasant on\r\naccount of a few bags of charcoal?"\r\n\r\n"I will shoot down like a dog," retorted Delmare, irritated by this\r\nremonstrance, "any man whom I find prowling around my premises at night.\r\nIf you knew the law, madame, you would know that it authorizes me to do\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"It is a horrible law," said Indiana, warmly. But she quickly repressed\r\nthis impulse and added in a lower tone: "But your rheumatism? You forget\r\nthat it rains, and that you will suffer for it to-morrow if you go out\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"You are terribly afraid that you will have to nurse your old husband,"\r\nreplied Delmare, impatiently opening the door.\r\n\r\nAnd he left the room, still muttering about his age and his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two personages whom we have mentioned, Indiana Delmare and Sir\r\nRalph, or, if you prefer, Monsieur Rodolphe Brown, continued to face\r\neach other, as calm and cold as if the husband were standing between\r\nthem. The Englishman had no idea of justifying himself, and Madame\r\nDelmare realized that she had no serious grounds for reproaching him,\r\nfor he had spoken with no evil intention. At last, making an effort, she\r\nbroke the silence and upbraided him mildly.\r\n\r\n"That was not well done of you, my dear Ralph," she said. "I had\r\nforbidden you to repeat the words that I let slip in a moment of pain,\r\nand Monsieur Delmare is the last person in the world whom I should want\r\ntold of my trouble."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand you, my dear," Sir Ralph replied; "you are ill and\r\nyou refuse to take care of yourself. I had to choose between the chance\r\nof losing you and the necessity of letting your husband know."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Madame Delmare, with a sad smile, "and you decided to\r\n_notify the authorities._"\r\n\r\n"You are wrong, you are wrong, on my word, to allow yourself to inveigh\r\nso against the colonel; he is a man of honor, a worthy man."\r\n\r\n"And who says that he\'s not, Sir Ralph?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you do, without meaning to. Your depression, your ailing\r\ncondition, and, as he himself observes, your red eyes, tell everybody\r\nevery hour in the day that you are not happy."\r\n\r\n"Hush, Sir Ralph, you go too far. I have never given you permission to\r\nfind out so much."\r\n\r\n"I anger you, I see; but what would you have! I am not clever; I am not\r\nacquainted with the subtle distinctions of your language, and then, too,\r\nI resemble your husband in many ways. Like him I am utterly in the dark\r\nas to what a man must say to a woman, either in English or in French, to\r\nconsole her. Another man would have conveyed to your mind, without\r\nputting it in words, the idea that I have just expressed so awkwardly;\r\nhe would have had the art to insinuate himself into your confidence\r\nwithout allowing you to detect his progress, and perhaps he would have\r\nsucceeded in affording some relief to your heart, which puts fetters on\r\nitself and locks itself up before me. This is not the first time that I\r\nhave noticed how much more influence words have upon women than ideas,\r\nespecially in France. Women more than----"\r\n\r\n"Oh! you have a profound contempt for women, my dear Ralph. I am alone\r\nhere against two of you, so I must make up my mind never to be right."\r\n\r\n"Put us in the wrong, my dear cousin, by recovering your health, your\r\ngood spirits, your bloom, your animation of the old days; remember Ile\r\nBourbon and that delightful retreat of ours, Bernica, and our happy\r\nchildhood, and our friendship, which is as old as you are yourself."\r\n\r\n"I remember my father, too," said Indiana, dwelling sadly upon the words\r\nand placing her hand in Sir Ralph\'s.\r\n\r\nThey relapsed into profound silence.\r\n\r\n"Indiana," said Ralph, after a pause, "happiness is always within our\r\nreach. Often one has only to put out his hand to grasp it. What do you\r\nlack? You have modest competence, which is preferable to great wealth,\r\nan excellent husband, who loves you with all his heart, and, I dare to\r\nassert, a sincere and devoted friend."\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare pressed Sir Ralph\'s hand faintly, but she did not change\r\nher attitude; her head still hung forward on her breast and her\r\ntear-dimmed eyes were fixed on the magic effects produced by the embers.\r\n\r\n"Your depression, my dear friend," continued Sir Ralph, "is due purely\r\nto physical causes; which one of us can escape disappointment, vexation?\r\nLook below you and you will see people who envy you, and with good\r\nreason. Man is so constituted that he always aspires to what he has\r\nnot."\r\n\r\nI spare you a multitude of other commonplaces which the excellent Sir\r\nRalph put forth in a tone as monotonous and sluggish as his thoughts. It\r\nwas not that Sir Ralph was a fool, but he was altogether out of his\r\nelement. He lacked neither common sense nor shrewdness; but the r\xc3\xb4le of\r\nconsoler of women was, as he himself acknowledged, beyond his capacity.\r\nAnd this man had so little comprehension of another\'s grief, that with\r\nthe best possible disposition to furnish a remedy, he could not touch it\r\nwithout inflaming it. He was so conscious of his awkwardness that he\r\nrarely ventured to take notice of his friend\'s sorrows; and on this\r\noccasion he made superhuman efforts to perform what he considered the\r\nmost painful duty of friendship.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw that Madame Delmare was obliged to make an effort to listen\r\nto him, he held his peace, and naught could be heard save the\r\ninnumerable little voices whispering in the burning wood, the plaintive\r\nsong of the log as it becomes heated and swells, the crackling of the\r\nbark as it curls before breaking, and the faint phosphorescent\r\nexplosions of the alburnum, which emits a bluish flame. From time to\r\ntime the baying of a dog mingled with the whistling of the wind through\r\nthe cracks of the door and the beating of the rain against the\r\nwindowpanes. That evening was one of the saddest that Madame Delmare had\r\nyet passed in her little manor-house in Brie.\r\n\r\nMoreover, an indefinable vague feeling of suspense weighed upon that\r\nimpressionable soul and its delicate fibres. Weak creatures live on\r\nalarms and presentiments. Madame Delmare had all the superstitions of a\r\nnervous, sickly Creole; certain nocturnal sounds, certain phases of the\r\nmoon were to her unfailing presages of specific events, of impending\r\nmisfortunes, and the night spoke to that dreamy, melancholy creature a\r\nlanguage full of mysteries and phantoms which she alone could understand\r\nand translate according to her fears and her sufferings.\r\n\r\n"You will say again that I am mad," she said, withdrawing her hand,\r\nwhich Sir Ralph still held, "but some disaster, I don\'t know what, is\r\npreparing to fall upon us. Some danger is impending over\r\nsomeone--myself, no doubt--but, look you, Ralph, I feel intensely\r\nagitated, as at the approach of a great crisis in my destiny. I am\r\nafraid," she added, with a shudder, "I feel faint."\r\n\r\nAnd her lips became as white as her cheeks. Sir Ralph, terrified, not by\r\nMadame Delmare\'s presentiments, which he looked upon as symptoms of\r\nextreme mental exhaustion, but by her deathly pallor, pulled the\r\nbell-rope violently to summon assistance. No one came, and as Indiana\r\ngrew weaker and weaker, Sir Ralph, more alarmed in proportion, moved her\r\naway from the fire, deposited her in a reclining chair, and ran through\r\nthe house at random, calling the servants, looking for water or salts,\r\nfinding nothing, breaking all the bell-ropes, losing his way in the\r\nlabyrinth of dark rooms, and wringing his hands with impatience and\r\nanger against himself.\r\n\r\nAt last it occurred to him to open the glass door that led into the\r\npark, and to call alternately Leli\xc3\xa8vre and Noun, Madame Delmare\'s\r\nCreole maid.\r\n\r\nA few moments later Noun appeared from one of the dark paths in the\r\npark, and hastily inquired if Madame Delmare were worse than usual.\r\n\r\n"She is really ill," replied Sir Ralph.\r\n\r\nThey returned to the salon and devoted themselves to the task of\r\nrestoring the unconscious Madame Delmare, one with all the ardor of\r\nuseless and awkward zeal, the other with the skill and efficacy of\r\nwomanly affection.\r\n\r\nNoun was Madame Delmare\'s foster-sister; the two young women had been\r\nbrought up together and loved each other dearly. Noun was tall and\r\nstrong, glowing with health, active, alert, overflowing with ardent,\r\npassionate creole blood; and she far outshone with her resplendent\r\nbeauty the frail and pallid charms of Madame Delmare; but the tenderness\r\nof their hearts and the strength of their attachment killed every\r\nfeeling of feminine rivalry.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Delmare recovered consciousness, the first thing that she\r\nobserved was the unusual expression of her maid\'s features, the damp and\r\ndisordered condition of her hair and the excitement which was manifest\r\nin her every movement.\r\n\r\n"Courage, my poor child," she said kindly; "my illness is more\r\ndisastrous to you than to myself. Why, Noun, you are the one to take\r\ncare of yourself; you are growing thin and weeping as if it were not\r\nyour destiny to live; dear Noun, life is so bright and fair before you!"\r\n\r\nNoun pressed Madame Delmare\'s hand to her lips effusively, and said, in\r\na sort of frenzy, glancing wildly about the room:\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_ madame, do you know why Monsieur Delmare is in the park?"\r\n\r\n"Why?" echoed Indiana, losing instantly the faint flush that had\r\nreappeared on her cheeks. "Wait a moment--I don\'t know--You frighten me!\r\nWhat is the matter, pray?"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Delmare declares that there are thieves in the park," replied\r\nNoun in a broken voice. "He is making the rounds with Leli\xc3\xa8vre, both\r\narmed with guns."\r\n\r\n"Well?" said Indiana, apparently expecting some shocking news.\r\n\r\n"Why, madame," rejoined Noun, clasping her hands frantically, "isn\'t it\r\nhorrible to think that they are going to kill a man?"\r\n\r\n"Kill a man!" cried Madame Delmare, springing to her feet with the\r\nterrified credulity of a child frightened by it\'s nurse\'s tales.\r\n\r\n"Ah! yes, they will kill him," said Noun, stifling her sobs.\r\n\r\n"These two women are mad," thought Sir Ralph, who was watching this\r\nstrange scene with a bewildered air. "Indeed," he added mentally, "all\r\nwomen are."\r\n\r\n"But why do you say that, Noun," continued Madame Delmare; "do you\r\nbelieve that there are any thieves there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! if they were really thieves! but some poor peasant perhaps, who has\r\ncome to pick up a handful of wood for his family!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that would be ghastly, as you say! But it is not probable; right\r\nat the entrance to Fontainebleau forest, when it is so easy to steal\r\nwood there, nobody would take the risk of a park enclosed by walls. Bah!\r\nMonsieur Delmare won\'t find anybody in the park, so don\'t you be\r\nafraid."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration 02:_MADAME DELMARE DRESSES DE\r\nRAMI\xc3\x88RES WOUNDS._\r\n_A mattress was placed on several chairs, and\r\nIndiana, assisted by her women, busied herself in\r\ndressing the wounded hand, while Sir Ralph, who\r\nhad some surgical knowledge, drew a large quantity\r\nof blood from him._]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Noun was not listening; she walked from the window to her mistress\'s\r\nchair, her ears strained to catch the slightest sound; she seemed torn\r\nbetween the longing to run after Monsieur Delmare and the desire to\r\nremain with the invalid.\r\n\r\nHer anxiety seemed so strange, so uncalled-for to Monsieur Brown, that\r\nhe laid aside his customary mildness of manner, and said, grasping her\r\narm roughly:\r\n\r\n"Have you lost your wits altogether? don\'t you see that you frighten\r\nyour mistress and that your absurd alarms have a disastrous effect upon\r\nher?"\r\n\r\nNoun did not hear him; she had turned her eyes upon her mistress, who\r\nhad just started on her chair as if the concussion of the air had\r\nimparted an electric shock to her senses. Almost at the same instant the\r\nreport of a gun shook the windows of the salon, and Noun fell upon her\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n"What miserable woman\'s terrors!" cried Sir Ralph, worn out by their\r\nemotion; "in a moment a dead rabbit will be brought to you in triumph,\r\nand you will laugh at yourselves."\r\n\r\n"No, Ralph," said Madame Delmare, walking with a firm step toward the\r\ndoor, "I tell you that human blood has been shed."\r\n\r\nNoun uttered a piercing shriek and fell upon her face.\r\n\r\nThe next moment they heard Leli\xc3\xa8vre\'s voice in the park:\r\n\r\n"He\'s there! he\'s there! Well aimed, my colonel! the brigand is down!"\r\n\r\nSir Ralph began to be excited. He followed Madame Delmare. A few moments\r\nlater a man covered with blood and giving no sign of life was brought\r\nunder the peristyle.\r\n\r\n"Not so much noise! less shrieking!" said the colonel with rough gayety\r\nto the terrified servants who crowded around the wounded man; "this is\r\nonly a joke; my gun was loaded with nothing but salt. Indeed I don\'t\r\nthink I touched him; he fell from fright."\r\n\r\n"But what about this blood, monsieur?" said Madame Delmare in a\r\nprofoundly reproachful tone, "was it fear that caused it to flow?"\r\n\r\n"Why are you here, madame?" cried Monsieur Delmare, "what are you doing\r\nhere?"\r\n\r\n"I have come to repair the harm that you have done, as it is my duty to\r\ndo," replied Madame Delmare coldly.\r\n\r\nShe walked up to the wounded man with a courage of which no one of the\r\npersons present had as yet felt capable, and held a light to his face.\r\nThereupon, instead of the plebeian features and garments which they\r\nexpected to see, they discovered a young man with noble features and\r\nfashionably dressed, albeit in hunting costume. He had a trifling wound\r\non one hand, but his torn clothes and his swoon indicated a serious\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n"I should say as much!" said Leli\xc3\xa8vre; "he fell from a height of twenty\r\nfeet. He was just putting his leg over the wall when the colonel fired,\r\nand a few grains of small shot or salt in the right hand prevented his\r\ngetting a hold. The fact is, I saw him fall, and when he got to the\r\nbottom he wasn\'t thinking much about running away, poor devil!"\r\n\r\n"Would any one believe," said one of the female servants, "that a man so\r\nnicely dressed would amuse himself by stealing?"\r\n\r\n"And his pockets are full of money!" said another, who had unbuttoned\r\nthe supposed thief\'s waistcoat.\r\n\r\n"It is very strange," said the colonel, gazing, not without emotion, at\r\nthe man stretched out before him. "If the man is dead it\'s not my fault;\r\nexamine his hand, madame, and see if you can find a particle of lead in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I prefer to believe you, monsieur," replied Madame Delmare, who, with a\r\nself-possession and moral courage of which no one would have deemed her\r\ncapable, was closely scrutinizing his pulse and the arteries of his\r\nneck. "Certainly," she added, "he is not dead, and he requires speedy\r\nattention. The man hasn\'t the appearance of a thief and perhaps he\r\ndeserves our care; even if he does not deserve it, our duty calls upon\r\nus women to care for him none the less."\r\n\r\nThereupon Madame Delmare ordered the wounded man to be carried to the\r\nbilliard room, which was nearest. A mattress was placed on several\r\nchairs, and Indiana, assisted by her women, busied herself in dressing\r\nthe wounded hand, while Sir Ralph, who had some surgical knowledge, drew\r\na large quantity of blood from him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the colonel, much embarrassed, found himself in the position\r\nof a man who has shown more ill-temper than he intended to show. He felt\r\nthe necessity of justifying himself in the eyes of the others, or rather\r\nof making them justify him in his own eyes. So he had remained under the\r\nperistyle, surrounded by his servants, and indulging with them in the\r\nexcited, prolix and perfectly useless disquisitions which are always\r\nforthcoming after the event. Leli\xc3\xa8vre had already explained twenty\r\ntimes, with the most minute details, the shot, the fall and its results,\r\nwhile the colonel, who had recovered his good-nature among his own\r\npeople, according to his custom, after giving way to his anger,\r\nimpeached the purposes of a man who entered private property in the\r\nnight-time over the wall. Every one agreed with the master, when the\r\ngardener, quietly leading him aside, assured him that the thief was the\r\nliving image of a young land-owner who had recently settled in the\r\nneighborhood, and whom he had seen talking with Mademoiselle Noun three\r\ndays before at the rustic f\xc3\xaate at Rubelles.\r\n\r\nThis information gave a different turn to Monsieur Delmare\'s ideas; on\r\nhis ample forehead, bald and glistening, appeared a huge swollen vein,\r\nwhich was always the precursor of a tempest.\r\n\r\n"Morbleu!" he said, clenching his fists, "Madame Delmare takes a deal of\r\ninterest in this puppy, who sneaks into my park over the wall!"\r\n\r\nAnd he entered the billiard room, pale and trembling with wrath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"You may be reassured, monsieur," said Indiana; "the man you killed will\r\nbe quite well in a few days; at least we hope so, although he is not yet\r\nable to talk."\r\n\r\n"That\'s not the question, madame," said the colonel, in a voice that\r\ntrembled with suppressed passion; "I insist upon knowing the name of\r\nthis interesting patient of yours, and how it came about that he mistook\r\nthe wall of my park for the avenue to my house."\r\n\r\n"I have absolutely no idea," replied Madame Delmare with such a cold and\r\nhaughty air that her redoubtable spouse was bewildered for an instant.\r\n\r\nBut his jealous suspicions soon regained the upper hand.\r\n\r\n"I shall find out, madame," he said in an undertone; "you may be sure\r\nthat I shall find out."\r\n\r\nThereupon, as Madame Delmare pretended not to notice his rage and\r\ncontinued her attentions to the wounded man, he left the room, in order\r\nnot to explode before the women, and recalled the gardener.\r\n\r\n"What is the name of the man who, you say, resembles our prowler?"\r\n\r\n"Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re. It is he who has just bought Monsieur de Cercy\'s\r\nlittle English house."\r\n\r\n"What sort of man is he? a nobleman, a fop, a fine gentleman?"\r\n\r\n"A fine gentleman, monsieur; noble, I think."\r\n\r\n"Undoubtedly," rejoined the colonel with emphasis. "Monsieur de\r\nRami\xc3\xa8re! Tell me, Louis," he added, lowering his voice, "have you ever\r\nseen this fop prowling about here?"\r\n\r\n"Last night, monsieur," Louis replied, with an embarrassed air, "I\r\ncertainly saw--as to its being a fop, I can\'t say, but it was a man,\r\nsure enough."\r\n\r\n"And you saw him?"\r\n\r\n"As plainly as I see you, under the windows of the orangery."\r\n\r\n"And you didn\'t fall upon him with the handle of your shovel?"\r\n\r\n"I was just going to do it, monsieur; but I saw a woman in white come\r\nout of the orangery and go to meet him. At that I said to myself:\r\n\'Perhaps it\'s monsieur and madame, who have taken a fancy to walk a bit\r\nbefore daybreak;\' and I went back to bed. But this morning I heard\r\nLeli\xc3\xa8vre talking about a thief whose tracks he had seen in the park,\r\nand I said to myself: \'There\'s something under this.\'"\r\n\r\n"And why didn\'t you tell me immediately, stupid?"\r\n\r\n"_Dame!_ monsieur, there are some things in life that are _so\r\ndelicate!_"\r\n\r\n"I understand--you presume to have doubts. You are a fool; if you ever\r\nhave another insolent idea of this sort I\'ll cut off your ears. I know\r\nvery well who the thief is and why he came into the garden. I have put\r\nall these questions to you simply to find out what care you take of your\r\norangery. Remember that I have some rare plants there that madame sets\r\ngreat store by, and that there are collectors who are insane enough to\r\nrob their neighbors\' hothouses; it was I whom you saw last night with\r\nMadame Delmare."\r\n\r\nAnd the poor colonel walked away, more tormented, more exasperated than\r\nbefore, leaving his gardener far from convinced that there are\r\nhorticulturists fanatical enough to risk a bullet in order to purloin a\r\nshoot or a cutting.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Delmare returned to the billiard-room and, paying no heed to\r\nthe symptoms of returning consciousness which the wounded man displayed\r\nat last, he was preparing to search the pockets of his jacket which lay\r\non a chair, when he put out his hand and said in a faint voice:\r\n\r\n"You wish to know who I am, monsieur, but it is useless. I will tell you\r\nwhen we are alone. Until then spare me the embarrassment of making\r\nmyself known in my present disagreeable and absurd position."\r\n\r\n"It is a great pity in truth!" retorted the colonel sourly; "but I\r\nconfess that I hardly appreciate it. However, as I trust that we shall\r\nmeet again, and alone, I consent to defer an acquaintance until then.\r\nMeanwhile will you kindly tell me where I shall have you taken."\r\n\r\n"To the public house in the nearest village, if you please."\r\n\r\n"But monsieur is no condition to be moved, is he, Ralph?" said Madame\r\nDelmare hastily.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur\'s condition affects you far too much, madame," said the\r\ncolonel. "Leave the room, all of you," he said to the women in\r\nattendance. "Monsieur feels better, and he will find strength now to\r\nexplain his presence on my premises."\r\n\r\n"Yes, monsieur," rejoined the wounded man, "and I beg all those who have\r\nbeen kind enough to bestow any care upon me to listen to my\r\nacknowledgment of my misconduct. I feel that is of much importance that\r\nthere should be no misunderstanding here of my motives, and it is of\r\nimportance to myself that I should not be deemed what I am not. Let me\r\ntell you then what rascally scheme brought me to your park. You have\r\ninstalled, monsieur, by methods of extreme simplicity, known to you\r\nalone, a factory which is immeasurably superior to all similar factories\r\nin the province, both in respect to its processes and its product. My\r\nbrother owns a very similar establishment in the south of France, but\r\nthe cost of running it is enormous. His business was approaching\r\nshipwreck when I learned of the success of your venture; whereupon I\r\ndetermined to come and ask you to give me advice on certain points,--a\r\ngenerous service which could not possibly injure your own interests, as\r\nmy brother\'s output is of an entirely different nature from yours. But\r\nthe gate of your English garden was rigorously closed to me; and when I\r\nasked for an interview with you, I was told that you would not even\r\nallow me to look over your establishment. Repelled by these discourteous\r\nrefusals, I determined to save my brother\'s life and honor even at the\r\nperil of my own; I entered your premises at night by scaling the wall,\r\nand tried to obtain entrance to the factory in order to examine the\r\nmachinery. I had determined to hide in a corner; to bribe your workmen,\r\nto steal your secret,--in a word, to enable an honest man to profit by\r\nit without injuring you. Such was my crime. Now, monsieur, if you demand\r\nany other reparation than that which you have just taken, I am ready to\r\noffer it to you as soon as I am strong enough; indeed, I may perhaps\r\ndemand it."\r\n\r\n"I think that we should cry quits, monsieur," replied the colonel, half\r\nrelieved from a great anxiety. "Take notice, all of you, of the\r\nexplanation monsieur has given me. I am over-avenged, assuming that I\r\nrequire any revenge. Go now and leave us to discuss my profitable\r\nbusiness operations."\r\n\r\nThe servants left the room; but they alone were deceived by this\r\nreconciliation. The wounded man, weakened by his long speech, was not\r\ncapable of appreciating the tone of the colonel\'s last words. He fell\r\nback into Madame Delmare\'s arms and lost consciousness a second time.\r\nShe leaned over him, not deigning to raise her eyes to her angry\r\nhusband, and the two strikingly contrasted faces of Monsieur Delmare and\r\nMonsieur Brown, the one pale and distorted by anger, the other calm and\r\nexpressionless as usual, questioned each other in silence.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Delmare did not need to say a word to make himself understood;\r\nhowever he drew Sir Ralph aside and said, crushing his fingers in his\r\ngrasp:\r\n\r\n"This is an admirably woven intrigue, my friend. I am delighted,\r\nperfectly delighted with this young fellow\'s quick wit, which enabled\r\nhim to save my honor in the eyes of my servants. But, _mordieu!_ he\r\nshall pay dear for the insult, which I feel in the depths of my heart.\r\nAnd that woman nursing him, who pretends not to know him! Ah! how true\r\nit is that cunning is inborn in those creatures!"\r\n\r\nSir Ralph, utterly nonplussed, walked methodically up and down the room\r\nthree times. At his first turn he drew the conclusion: _improbable_; at\r\nthe second: _impossible_; at the third: _proven._ Then, returning with\r\nhis impassive face to the colonel, he pointed to Noun, who was standing\r\nbehind the wounded man, wringing her hands, with haggard eyes and livid\r\ncheeks, in the immobility of despair, terror and misery.\r\n\r\nA real discovery carries with it such a power of swift and overwhelming\r\nconviction, that the colonel was more impressed by Sir Ralph\'s emphatic\r\ngesture than he would have been by the most persuasive eloquence.\r\nDoubtless Sir Ralph had more than one means of striking the right scent;\r\nhe recalled the fact that Noun was in the park when he called her, her\r\nwet hair, her damp, muddy shoes, which testified to a strange fancy for\r\nwalking abroad in the rain--trivial details which had made but slight\r\nimpression on him at the time that Madame Delmare fainted, but which\r\nrecurred to his memory now. Then, too, the extraordinary terror she had\r\nmanifested, her convulsive agitation, and the cry she had uttered when\r\nshe heard the shot.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Delmare did not require all this evidence; being more\r\npenetrating because he had more interest in the matter, he had only to\r\nlook at the girl\'s face to see that she alone was guilty. But his wife\'s\r\nassiduity in ministering to the hero of this amorous adventure became\r\nmore and more distasteful to him.\r\n\r\n"Leave us, Indiana," he said. "It is late and you are not well. Noun\r\nwill remain with monsieur to take care of him during the night, and\r\nto-morrow, if he is better, we will see about having him taken home."\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to say in reply to this unexpected complaisance.\r\nMadame Delmare, who was so determined in her resistance to her husband\'s\r\nviolence, always yielded to his milder moods. She requested Sir Ralph to\r\nremain a little longer with the patient, and withdrew to her bedroom.\r\n\r\nNot without ulterior motives had the colonel arranged things thus. An\r\nhour later, when everybody had gone to bed and the house was still, he\r\nstole softly into the room where Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re lay, and, hiding\r\nbehind a curtain, was speedily convinced, by the young man\'s\r\nconversation with the lady\'s-maid, that an amorous intrigue between the\r\ntwo was in progress. The young creole\'s unusual beauty had created a\r\nsensation at the rustic balls in the neighborhood. She had not lacked\r\noffers of homage, even from members of some of the first families of the\r\nprovince. More than one handsome officer of lancers, in garrison at\r\nMelun, had put himself out to please her; but Noun was still to have her\r\nfirst love affair, and only one of her suitors had succeeded in pleasing\r\nher: Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\nColonel Delmare was by no means desirous of following the development of\r\ntheir liaison; so he retired as soon as he had made sure that his wife\r\nhad not for an instant occupied the thoughts of the Almaviva of this\r\nadventure. He heard enough of it, however, to realize the difference\r\nbetween the love of poor Noun, who threw herself into the affair with\r\nall the vehemence of her passionate nature, and that of the well-born\r\nyouth, who yielded to the impulse of a day without abjuring the right to\r\nresume his reason on the morrow.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Delmare awoke she found Noun beside her bed, embarrassed and\r\ndowncast. But she had ingenuously given credence to Monsieur de\r\nRami\xc3\xa8re\'s explanation, the more readily as persons interested in\r\nMonsieur Delmare\'s line of trade had previously tried to surprise the\r\nsecrets of the Delmare factory, by stratagem or by fraud. She attributed\r\nher companion\'s embarrassment therefore to the excitement and fatigue of\r\nthe night, and Noun took courage when she saw the colonel calmly enter\r\nhis wife\'s room and discuss the affair of the previous evening with her\r\nas a perfectly natural occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Sir Ralph had satisfied himself as to the patient\'s\r\ncondition. The fall, although a severe one, had had no serious result;\r\nthe wound in the hand had already closed; Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re had\r\nexpressed a desire to be taken to Melun, and he had distributed the\r\ncontents of his purse among the servants to induce them to keep quiet\r\nconcerning his adventure, in order, he said, that his mother, who lived\r\nwithin a few leagues, might not be alarmed. Thus the story became known\r\nvery slowly, and in several different versions. Certain information\r\nconcerning the English factory of Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re, the brother,\r\nadded weight to the fiction the intruder had happily improvised. The\r\ncolonel and Sir Ralph had the delicacy to keep Noun\'s secret, without\r\neven letting her know that they knew it; and the Delmare family soon\r\nceased to give any thought to the incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will find it difficult to believe perhaps that Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re,\r\na young man of brilliant intellect, considerable talents and many\r\nestimable qualities, accustomed to salon triumphs and to adventures in\r\nperfumed boudoirs, had conceived a very durable passion for the\r\nhousekeeper in the household of a small manufacturer in Brie. And yet\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re was neither fop nor libertine. We have said that he\r\nwas intelligent--that is to say, he appreciated the advantages of birth\r\nat their real value. He was a man of high principle when he argued with\r\nhimself; but vehement passions often carried him beyond the bounds of\r\nhis theories. At such times he was incapable of reflection, or he\r\navoided appearing before the tribunal of his conscience: he went astray,\r\nas if without his own knowledge, and the man of yesterday strove to\r\ndeceive him of to-morrow. Unfortunately the most salient feature in his\r\ncharacter was not his principles, which he possessed in common with many\r\nother white-gloved philosophers and which no more preserved him from\r\ninconsistency than they preserve them; but his passions, which no\r\nprinciples could stifle, and which made of him a man apart in that\r\ndegenerate society where it is so difficult to depart from the beaten\r\npath without appearing ridiculous. Raymon had the art of being often\r\nculpable without arousing hatred, often eccentric without being\r\noffensive; indeed he sometimes succeeded in arousing the pity of people\r\nwho had the most reason to complain of him. There are men who are\r\nhumored thus by every one who approaches them. Sometimes an attractive\r\nface and animated speech make up the sum total of their sensibility. We\r\ndo not presume to judge Monsieur Raymon de Rami\xc3\xa8re so harshly, nor to\r\ndraw his portrait before exhibiting him in action. We are examining him\r\nnow at a distance, like the multitude who pass him in the street.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re was in love with the young creole with the great\r\nblack eyes, who had aroused the admiration of the whole province at the\r\nf\xc3\xaate of Rubelles; but he was in love and nothing more. He had made her\r\nacquaintance because he had nothing else to do, perhaps, and success had\r\nkindled his desires; he had obtained more than he asked, and on the day\r\nthat he triumphed over that easily vanquished heart he returned home\r\ndismayed by his victory, and said to himself, striking his forehead:\r\n\r\n"God grant that she doesn\'t love me!"\r\n\r\nThus it was not until after he had accepted all the proofs of her love\r\nthat he began to suspect the existence of that love. Then he repented,\r\nbut it was too late; he must either resign himself to what the future\r\nmight have in store, or retreat like a coward toward the past. Raymon\r\ndid not hesitate; he allowed himself to be loved, he loved in return for\r\ngratitude; he scaled the walls of the Delmare estate from love of\r\ndanger; he had a terrible fall from awkwardness; and he was so touched\r\nby his lovely young mistress\'s grief that he deemed himself justified\r\nthenceforth in his own eyes in continuing to dig the pit into which she\r\nwas destined to fall.\r\n\r\nWhen he had recovered, winter had no storms, darkness no perils, remorse\r\nno stings which could deter him from passing through the corner of the\r\nforest to meet the young creole and swear to her that he had never loved\r\nany other woman; that he preferred her to the queens of society, and a\r\nthousand other exaggerations which will always be fashionable with poor\r\nand credulous maidens. In January Madame Delmare went to Paris with her\r\nhusband; Sir Ralph Brown, their excellent neighbor, betook himself to\r\nhis own estate, and Noun, being left in charge of her master\'s country\r\nhouse, was able to absent herself on various pretexts. It was\r\nunfortunate for her, and this facility of intercourse with her lover\r\ngreatly abridged the ephemeral happiness which she was destined to\r\nenjoy. The forest with its poetic shadows, its arabesques of hoar-frost,\r\nits moonlight effects, the mysterious going and coming by the little\r\ngate, the furtive departure in the morning when Noun\'s little feet, as\r\nshe accompanied him to the gate, left their prints on the snow in the\r\npark--all these accessories of an amorous intrigue served to prolong\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s intoxication. Noun, in white _d\xc3\xa9shablil\xc3\xa9_, with\r\nher long black hair for ornament, was a lady, a queen, a fairy; when he\r\nsaw her come forth from that red brick castle, a heavy, square structure\r\nof the time of the Regency, with a semi-feudal aspect, he could easily\r\nfancy her a ch\xc3\xa2telaine of the Middle Ages, and in the summerhouse\r\nfilled with rare flowers, where she made him drunk with the seductions\r\nof youth and passion, he readily forgot all that he was destined to\r\nremember later.\r\n\r\nBut when Noun, disdaining precautions and defying danger in her turn,\r\ncame to him at his home, with her white apron and neckerchief\r\ncoquettishly arranged according to the fashion of her country, she was\r\nnothing more than a maid and a maid in the service of a pretty woman--a\r\ncircumstance that always makes a soubrette seem like a makeshift. And\r\nyet Noun was very lovely, it was in that dress that he had first seen\r\nher at that village f\xc3\xaate where he had forced his way through the crowd\r\nof curious bystanders, and had enjoyed the petty triumph of carrying her\r\noff from a score of rivals. Noun would lovingly remind him of that day;\r\nshe did not know, poor child, that Raymon\'s love did not date back so\r\nfar, and that her day of pride had been only a day of vanity to him. And\r\nthen the courage with which she sacrificed her reputation to him--that\r\ncourage which should have made him love her all the more--displeased\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re. The wife of a peer of France who should sacrifice\r\nherself so recklessly would be a priceless conquest; but a lady\'s maid!\r\nThat which is heroism in the one becomes brazen-faced effrontery in the\r\nother. With the one a world of jealous rivals envies you; with the other\r\na rabble of scandalized flunkeys condemns you. The lady of quality\r\nsacrifices twenty previous lovers to you; the lady\'s maid sacrifices\r\nonly a husband that she might have had.\r\n\r\nWhat can you expect? Raymon was a man of fashionable morals, of elegant\r\nmanners, of poetic passion. In his eyes a grisette was not a woman, and\r\nNoun, by virtue of a beauty of the first order, had taken him by\r\nsurprise on a day of popular merrymaking. All this was not Raymon\'s\r\nfault; he had been reared to shine in society, all his thoughts had been\r\ndirected toward an exalted goal, all his faculties had been moulded to\r\nenjoy princely good fortune, and the ardor of his blood had led him into\r\nbourgeois amours against his will. He had done all that he possibly\r\ncould do to prolong his enjoyment, but he had failed; what was he to do\r\nnow? Ideas extravagant in generosity had passed through his brain; on\r\nthe days when he was most in love with his mistress he had thought\r\nseriously of raising her to his level, of legitimizing their union. Yes,\r\nupon my honor, he had thought of it; but love, which legitimizes\r\neverything, was growing weaker now; it was passing away with the perils\r\nof the intrigue and the piquant charm of mystery. Marriage was no longer\r\npossible; and note this: Raymon reasoned very cogently and altogether in\r\nhis mistress\'s favor.\r\n\r\nIf he had really loved her, he could, by sacrificing to her his future,\r\nhis family and his reputation, still have found happiness, and,\r\nconsequently, have made her happy; for love is a contract no less than\r\nmarriage. But, his ardor having cooled as he felt that it had, what\r\nfuture could he create for her? Should he marry her and display day\r\nafter day a gloomy face, a cold heart, a comfortless home? Should he\r\nmarry her and make her odious to her family, contemptible in the eyes of\r\nher equals, and a laughing-stock to her servants; take the risk of\r\nintroducing her in a social circle where she would feel that she was out\r\nof place; where humiliation would kill her; and, lastly, overwhelm her\r\nwith remorse by forcing her to realize all the trials she had brought\r\nupon her lover?\r\n\r\nNo, you will agree with him that it was impossible, that it would not\r\nhave been generous, that a man cannot contend thus with society, and\r\nthat such heroic virtue resembles Don Quixote breaking his lance against\r\na windmill; an iron courage which a breath of wind scatters; the\r\nchivalry of another age which arouses the pitying contempt of this age.\r\n\r\nHaving thus weighed all the arguments, Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re concluded\r\nthat it would be better to break that unfortunate bond. Noun\'s visits\r\nwere beginning to be painful to him. His mother, who had gone to Paris\r\nfor the winter, would not fail to hear of the little scandal before\r\nlong. Even now she was surprised at his frequent visits to Cercy, their\r\ncountry estate, and at his passing whole weeks there. He had, to be\r\nsure, alleged as a pretext, an important piece of work which he was\r\nfinishing away from the noise of the city; but that pretext was\r\nbeginning to be worn out. It grieved Raymon to deceive so kind a mother,\r\nto deprive her for so long a time of his filial attentions; and--how\r\nshall I tell you?--he left Cercy and did not return.\r\n\r\nNoun wept and waited, and as the days and weeks passed, unhappy creature\r\nthat she was, she ventured so far as to write. Poor girl! that was the\r\nlast stroke. A letter from a lady\'s maid! Yet she had taken\r\nsatin-finished paper and perfumed wax from Madame Delmare\'s desk, and\r\nher style from her heart. But the spelling! Do you know how much energy\r\na syllable more or less adds to or detracts from the sentiments? Alas!\r\nthe poor half-civilized girl from Ile Bourbon did not know even that\r\nthere were rules for the use of language. She believed that she wrote\r\nand spoke as correctly as her mistress, and when she found that Raymon\r\ndid not return she said to herself:\r\n\r\n"And yet my letter was well adapted to bring him."\r\n\r\nThat letter Raymon lacked courage to read to the end. It was a\r\nmasterpiece of ingenuous and graceful passion; it is doubtful if\r\nVirginia wrote Paul a more charming one after she left her native land.\r\nBut Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re made haste to throw it in the fire, fearful\r\nlest he should blush for himself. Once more, what do you expect? This is\r\na prejudice of education, and self-love is a part of love just as\r\nself-interest is a part of friendship.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s absence had been noticed in society; that is much\r\nto say of a man, in respect to this society of ours where all men\r\nresemble one another. One may be a man of intelligence and still care\r\nfor society, just as one may be a fool and despise it. Raymon liked it,\r\nand he was justified in his liking, for he was a favorite and was much\r\nsought after; and that multitude of indifferent or sneering masks\r\nassumed for him attentive and interested smiles. Unfortunate men may be\r\nmisanthropes, but those persons of whom one is fond are rarely\r\nungrateful; at least so Raymon thought. He was grateful for the\r\nslightest manifestations of attachment, desirous of universal esteem,\r\nproud of having a large number of friends.\r\n\r\nIn this society, whose prejudices are absolute, everything had succeeded\r\nin his case, even his faults; and when he sought the cause of this\r\nuniversal affection which had always encompassed him, he found it in\r\nhimself, in his longing to obtain it, in the joy it caused him, in the\r\nhearty kindliness which he dealt out lavishly without exhausting it.\r\n\r\nHe owed it in some measure to his mother too, whose superior\r\nintelligence, sparkling conversation and private virtues made her an\r\nexceptional woman. It was from her that he inherited those excellent\r\nprinciples which always led him back to the right path and prevented\r\nhim, despite the impetuosity of his twenty-five years, from ever\r\nforfeiting his claim to public esteem. Moreover, people were more\r\nindulgent to him than to others because his mother had the knack of\r\napologizing for him while blaming him, of commanding indulgence when she\r\nseemed to implore it. She was one of those women who had lived through\r\ndifferent epochs so utterly dissimilar that their minds become as\r\nflexible as their destinies; who have grown rich on experience of\r\nmisfortune; who have escaped the scaffolds of \'93, the vices of the\r\nDirectory, the vanities of the Empire and the enmities of the\r\nRestoration; rare women, whose kind is dying out.\r\n\r\nIt was at a ball at the Spanish ambassador\'s that Raymon reappeared in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re, if I am not mistaken," said a pretty woman to her\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\n"He is a comet who appears at irregular intervals," was the reply. "It\r\nis centuries since any one heard of the pretty fellow."\r\n\r\nThe lady who spoke thus was a middle-aged foreigner. Her companion\r\nblushed slightly.\r\n\r\n"He\'s very good-looking, is he not, madame?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Charming, on my word," replied the old Sicilian.\r\n\r\n"You are talking about the hero of the eclectic salons, the dark-eyed\r\nRaymon, I\'ll be bound," said a dashing colonel of the guard.\r\n\r\n"He has a fine head to study," rejoined the younger woman.\r\n\r\n"And what pleases you even more, I dare say," said the colonel, "a\r\nwicked head."\r\n\r\nThe young woman was his wife.\r\n\r\n"Why a wicked head?" queried the Sicilian.\r\n\r\n"Full of genuine Southern passions, madame, worthy of the bright\r\nsunlight of Palermo."\r\n\r\nTwo or three young women put forward their flower-laden heads to hear\r\nwhat the colonel was saying.\r\n\r\n"He made ravages in the garrison last year, I promise you," he\r\ncontinued. "We fellows shall be obliged to pick a quarrel with him, in\r\norder to get rid of him."\r\n\r\n"If he\'s a Lovelace, so much the worse for him," said a young lady with\r\na satirical cast of countenance; "I can\'t endure men whom everybody\r\nloves."\r\n\r\nThe ultramontane countess waited until the colonel had walked away, when\r\nshe tapped Mademoiselle de Nangy\'s fingers lightly with her fan and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t speak so; you don\'t know here what to think of a man who wants to\r\nbe liked."\r\n\r\n"Do you think, pray, that all they have to do is to want it?" said the\r\ndamsel with the long sardonic eyes.\r\n\r\n"Mademoiselle," said the colonel, coming up again to invite her to\r\ndance; "take care that the charming Raymon does not overhear you."\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Nangy laughed; but during the rest of the evening the\r\npretty group of which she was one dared not mention Monsieur de\r\nRami\xc3\xa8re\'s name again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re wandered amid the undulating waves of that\r\ngayly-dressed crowd without distaste and without ennui.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was fighting against a feeling of chagrin. On returning\r\nto his own sphere he had a species of remorse, of shame for all the wild\r\nideas which a misplaced attachment had suggested to him. He looked at\r\nthe women so brilliantly beautiful in the bright light; he listened to\r\ntheir refined and clever conversation; he heard their talents highly\r\npraised; and in those marvellous specimens of their sex, those almost\r\nroyal costumes, those exquisitely appropriate remarks, he found on all\r\nsides an implied reproach for having been untrue to his destiny. But,\r\ndespite this species of mental bewilderment, Raymon suffered from more\r\ngenuine remorse; for his intentions were always kind and considerate to\r\nthe last degree, and a woman\'s tears broke his heart, hardened as it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThe honors of the evening were universally accorded to a young woman\r\nwhose name no one knew, and who enjoyed the privilege of monopolizing\r\nattention because her appearance in society was a novelty. The\r\nsimplicity of her costume alone would have sufficed to make her a\r\ndistinguished figure amid the diamonds, feathers and flowers in which\r\nthe other women were arrayed. Strings of pearls woven into her black\r\nhair were her only jewels. The lustreless white of her necklace, her\r\ncr\xc3\xaape dress and her bare shoulders blended at a little distance, and\r\nthe heated atmosphere of the apartments had barely succeeded in bringing\r\nto her cheeks a faint flush of as delicate a shade as that of a Bengal\r\nrose blooming on the snow. She was a tiny, dainty, slender creature; a\r\nsalon type of beauty to which the bright light of the candles gave a\r\nfairylike touch, and which a sunbeam would have dimmed. When she danced\r\nshe was so light that a breath would have whisked her away; but in her\r\nlightness there was no animation, no pleasure. When she was seated she\r\nbent forward as if her too flexible body lacked strength to support\r\nitself, and when she spoke she smiled sadly. Fantastic tales were at the\r\nvery height of their vogue at this period. Accordingly, those who were\r\nlearned in that line compared this young woman to a fascinating\r\napparition evoked by sorcery, which would fade away and vanish like a\r\ndream when the first flush of dawn appeared on the horizon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they crowded about her to invite her to dance.\r\n\r\n"Make haste," said a dandy of a romantic turn to one of his friends;\r\n"the cock will crow soon, and even now your partner\'s feet have ceased\r\nto touch the floor. I\'ll wager that you can\'t feel her hand in yours."\r\n\r\n"Pray look at Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s dark, strongly-marked face," said\r\nan _artistic_ lady to her neighbor. "Contrast him with that pale,\r\nslender young woman, and see if the _solid_ tone of the one doesn\'t make\r\nan admirable foil for the _delicate_ tone of the other."\r\n\r\n"That young woman," said a woman who knew everybody and who played the\r\npart of an almanac at social functions, "is the daughter of that old\r\nfool, De Carvajal, who tried to play Jos\xc3\xa9phin, and who died ruined at\r\nIle Bourbon. This lovely exotic flower has made a foolish marriage, I\r\nbelieve; but her aunt stands well at court."\r\n\r\nRaymon had drawn near the fair Indian. A peculiar emotion seized him\r\nevery time that he looked at her; he had seen that pale, sad face;\r\nperhaps in some dream, but at all events he had seen it, and his eyes\r\nrested upon it with the delight we all feel on seeing once more a\r\ncharming vision which we thought that we had lost forever.\r\n\r\nRaymon\'s gaze disturbed her who was the object of it; she was awkward\r\nand shy, like a person unaccustomed to society, and the sensation that\r\nshe caused seemed to embarrass rather than to please her. Raymon made\r\nthe circuit of the salon, succeeded finally in learning that her name\r\nwas Madame Delmare, and went and asked her to dance.\r\n\r\n"You do not remember me," he said, when they were alone in the midst of\r\nthe crowd; "but I have not been able to forget you, madame. And yet I\r\nsaw you for an instant only, through a cloud; but in that instant you\r\nseemed so kind, so compassionate."\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare started.\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, monsieur," she said quickly, "it is you! I recognized you,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nThen she blushed and seemed to fear that she had offended the\r\nproprieties. She looked around as if to see whether anyone had heard\r\nher. Her timidity enhanced her natural charm, and Raymon was touched to\r\nthe heart by the tone of that creole voice, slightly husky, but so sweet\r\nthat it seemed made to pray or to bless.\r\n\r\n"I was afraid," he said, "that I should never have an opportunity to\r\nthank you. I could not call upon you and I knew that you went but little\r\ninto society. I feared, also, that if I made your acquaintance I should\r\ncome in contact with Monsieur Delmare, and our previous relations could\r\nnot fail to make that contact disagreeable. How glad I am for this\r\nmoment, which enables me to pay the debt of my heart!"\r\n\r\n"It would be much pleasanter for me," said she, "if Monsieur Delmare\r\nalso could enjoy it; and if you knew him better you would know that he\r\nis as kind as he is brusque. You would forgive him for having been your\r\ninvoluntary assailant, for his heart certainly bled more freely than\r\nyour wound."\r\n\r\n"Let us not talk of Monsieur Delmare, madame; I forgive him with all my\r\nheart. I injured him and he took the law into his own hands. I have\r\nnothing more to do but to forget; but as to you, madame, who lavished\r\nsuch delicate and generous attentions upon me, I choose to remember all\r\nmy life your treatment of me, your pure features, your angelic\r\ngentleness, and these hands which poured balm upon my wounds and which I\r\ndared not kiss."\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke Raymon held Madame Delmare\'s hand, to be prepared to walk\r\nthrough their figure in the contradance. He pressed that hand gently in\r\nhis, and all the young woman\'s blood rushed to her heart.\r\n\r\nWhen he led Madame Delmare back to her seat, her aunt, Madame de\r\nCarvajal, had gone; the crowd was thinning. Raymon sat down beside her.\r\nHe had that ease of manner which a wide experience in affairs of the\r\nheart imparts; it is the violence of our desires, the precipitate haste\r\nof our love, that makes us stupid when we are with women. The man who\r\nhas rubbed the edge off his emotions a little is more anxious to please\r\nthan to love. Nevertheless Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re felt more deeply moved\r\nin the presence of that simple, unspoiled woman than he had ever been.\r\nPerhaps this swift impression was due to his memory of the night he had\r\npassed at her house; but it is certain that, while he talked to her with\r\nanimation, his heart did not lead his mouth astray. However, the habit\r\nhe had acquired with other women gave to his words a power of persuasion\r\nto which the untutored Indiana yielded, not understanding that it had\r\nnot all been invented expressly for her.\r\n\r\nIn general--and women are well aware of it--a man who talks wittily of\r\nlove is only moderately in love. Raymon was an exception; he expressed\r\npassion artistically and felt it ardently. But it was not passion that\r\nrendered him eloquent, it was eloquence that made him passionate. He\r\nknew that he had a weakness for women, and he would become eloquent in\r\norder to seduce a woman and fall in love with her while seducing her. It\r\nwas sentiment of the sort dealt in by advocates and preachers, who weep\r\nhot tears when they perspire freely. He sometimes fell in with women who\r\nwere shrewd enough to distrust these heated improvisations; but he had\r\ncommitted what are called follies for love\'s sake: he had run away with\r\na girl of noble birth; he had compromised women of very high station; he\r\nhad had three sensational duels; he had displayed to a crowded evening\r\nparty, to a whole theatre full of spectators, the bewilderment of his\r\nheart and the disarray of his thoughts. A man who does all this without\r\nfear of ridicule or of curses, and who succeeds in avoiding both, is\r\nsafe from all assault; he can take any risk and hope for anything. Thus\r\nthe most skilfully constructed defences yielded to the consideration\r\nthat Raymon was madly in love when he meddled with love at all. A man\r\ncapable of making a fool of himself for love is a rare prodigy in\r\nsociety, and one that women do not disdain.\r\n\r\nI do not know how it happened, but when he escorted Madame de Carvajal\r\nand Madame Delmare to their carriage he succeeded in putting Indiana\'s\r\nlittle hand to his lips. Never before had a man\'s furtive, burning kiss\r\nbreathed upon that woman\'s fingers, although she was born in a fiery\r\nclimate and was nineteen years old; nineteen years of Ile Bourbon, which\r\nare equivalent to twenty-five in our country.\r\n\r\nIll and nervous as she was, that kiss almost extorted a shriek from her,\r\nand she had to be assisted into the carriage. Raymon had never come in\r\ncontact with such a delicate organization. Noun, the creole, was in\r\nrobust health, and Parisian women do not faint when their hands are\r\nkissed.\r\n\r\n"If I should see her twice," he said to himself as he walked away, "I\r\nshould lose my head over her."\r\n\r\nThe next morning he had completely forgotten Noun.\r\n\r\nAll that he knew about her was that she belonged to Madame Delmare. The\r\npale-faced Indiana engrossed all his thoughts, filled all his dreams.\r\nWhen Raymon began to feel the shafts of love he was in the habit of\r\nseeking to distract his thoughts, not in order to stifle the budding\r\npassion, but, on the contrary, to drive away the reasoning power that\r\nurged him to weigh its consequences. Of an ardent temperament, he\r\npursued his object hotly. He had not the power to quell the tempests\r\nwhich arose in his bosom, nor to rekindle them when he felt that they\r\nwere dying away and vanishing.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded the next day in learning that Monsieur Delmare had gone to\r\nBrussels on a business trip, and had left his wife in charge of Madame\r\nde Carvajal, of whom he was not at all fond, but who was Madame\r\nDelmare\'s only relative. He, an upstart soldier, belonged to a poor and\r\nobscure family, of which he seemed to be ashamed, simply because he\r\nrepeated so often that he was not ashamed of it. But, although he passed\r\nhis life reproaching his wife for alleged scorn of him which she did not\r\nentertain, he was conscious that he ought not to compel her to live on\r\nterms of intimacy with his uneducated kindred. Moreover, despite his\r\ndislike for Madame de Carvajal, he could not refuse to treat her with\r\ngreat deference for these reasons.\r\n\r\nMadame de Carvajal, who was descended from a noble Spanish family, was\r\none of those women who cannot make up their minds to be of no account in\r\nthe world. In the days when Napoleon ruled Europe she had burned incense\r\nto the glory of Napoleon, and with her husband and brother-in-law had\r\njoined the party of the Jos\xc3\xa9phinos; but her husband had lost his life\r\nat the fall of the conqueror\'s short-lived dynasty, and Indiana\'s father\r\nhad taken refuge in the French colonies. Thereupon Madame de Carvajal,\r\nbeing a clever and active person, had repaired to Paris, and there, by\r\nsome fortunate speculations on the Bourse, had built up for herself a\r\nnew competence on the ruins of her past splendors. By dint of shrewd\r\nwit, intrigues and piety she had also obtained some favor at Court, and\r\nher establishment, while it was by no means brilliant, was one of the\r\nmost respectable of all those presided over by prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9s of the Civil\r\nList.\r\n\r\nWhen Indiana arrived in France after her father\'s death, as the bride of\r\nColonel Delmare, Madame de Carvajal was but moderately pleased by so\r\npaltry an alliance. Nevertheless she saw that Monsieur Delmare, whose\r\ngood sense and activity in business were worth a dowry, prospered with\r\nhis slender capital; and she purchased for Indiana the little ch\xc3\xa2teau\r\nof Lagny and the factory connected with it. In two years, thanks to\r\nMonsieur Delmare\'s technical knowledge and certain funds advanced by Sir\r\nRodolphe Brown, his wife\'s cousin by marriage, the colonel\'s affairs\r\ntook a fortunate turn; he began to pay off his debts, and Madame de\r\nCarvajal, in whose eyes fortune was the first recommendation, manifested\r\nmuch affection for her niece and promised her the remnant of her wealth.\r\nIndiana, who was devoid of ambition, was devotedly kind and attentive to\r\nher aunt from gratitude, not from self-interest; but there was at least\r\nas much of one as of the other in the colonel\'s man\xc5\x93uvres. He was a man\r\nof iron in the matter of his political opinions; he would listen to no\r\nargument concerning the unassailable glory of his great emperor, and he\r\nupheld that glory with the blind obstinacy of a child of sixty years. He\r\nwas obliged therefore to put forth all his patience to refrain from\r\nbreaking out again and again in Madame de Carjaval\'s salon, where the\r\nRestoration was lauded to the skies. What Delmare suffered at the hands\r\nof five or six pious old women is beyond description. His vexation on\r\nthis account was in part the cause of his frequent ill-humor against his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nSo much for Madame de Carvajal; we return now to Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re.\r\nAt the end of three days he had learned all these domestic details, so\r\nactively had he followed up everything likely to put him in the way of\r\nan intimate acquaintance with the Delmare family. He learned that by\r\nacquiring Madame de Carvajal\'s favor he could obtain opportunities of\r\nmeeting Indiana. On the evening of the third day he procured an\r\nintroduction to the aunt.\r\n\r\nIn her salon there were four or five barbarians solemnly playing\r\n_reversi_, and two or three young men of family, as utterly vapid as it\r\nis allowable for a man to be who has sixteen quarterings of nobility.\r\nIndiana was at work patiently filling in the background of a piece of\r\nembroidery on her aunt\'s frame. She was leaning over her work,\r\napparently absorbed by that mechanical operation, and, it may be, well\r\npleased to escape in this way the dull chatter of her neighbors. For\r\naught I know, behind the long black hair that fell over the flowers of\r\nher embroidery, she was reviewing in her mind the emotions of that\r\nfleeting instant which had opened the door of a new life to her, when\r\nthe servant\'s voice, announcing several new arrivals, made it necessary\r\nfor her to rise. She did so mechanically, for she had paid no heed to\r\nthe names, and barely lifted her eyes from her embroidery; but a voice\r\nat her side made her start as if she had received an electric shock, and\r\nshe was obliged to lean on her work-table to avoid falling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nRaymon was not prepared for that silent salon, peopled only by a few\r\ntaciturn guests. It was impossible to utter a word which was not heard\r\nin every corner of the room. The dowagers who were playing cards seemed\r\nto be there for the sole purpose of embarrassing the conversation of the\r\nyounger guests, and Raymon fancied that he could read on their stern\r\nfeatures the secret satisfaction which old age takes in avenging itself\r\nby blocking other people\'s pleasure. He had counted upon a less\r\nconstrained, tenderer interview than that of the ball, and it was just\r\nthe opposite. This unexpected difficulty gave greater intensity to his\r\ndesires, more fire to his glances, more animation and vivacity to the\r\nroundabout remarks he addressed to Madame Delmare. The poor child was\r\naltogether unused to this style of attack. She could not possibly defend\r\nherself, because nothing was asked of her; but she was forced to listen\r\nto the proffer of an ardent heart, to learn how dearly she was loved,\r\nand to allow herself to be encompassed by all the perils of seduction\r\nwithout making any resistance. Her embarrassment increased with Raymon\'s\r\nboldness. Madame de Carvajal, who made some reasonably well-founded\r\nclaims to wit, and to whom Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s wit had been highly\r\npraised, left the card-table to challenge him to a refined discussion\r\nconcerning love, into which she introduced much Spanish heat and German\r\nmetaphysics. Raymon eagerly accepted the challenge, and, on the pretext\r\nof answering the aunt, said to the niece all that she would have refused\r\nto hear. The poor young wife, without a protector and exposed to so\r\nlively and skilful an assault on all sides, could not muster strength to\r\ntake part in that thorny discussion. In vain did her aunt, who was\r\nanxious to exhibit her to advantage, call upon her to testify to the\r\ntruth of certain subtle theories of sentiment; she confessed blushingly\r\nthat she knew nothing about such things, and Raymon, intoxicated with\r\njoy to see her cheeks flush and her bosom heave, swore inwardly that he\r\nwould teach her.\r\n\r\nIndiana slept less that night than she had done for the last two or\r\nthree nights; as we have said, she had never been in love, and her heart\r\nhad long been ripe for a sentiment which none of the men she had met\r\nhitherto had succeeded in arousing. She had been brought up by a father\r\nof an eccentric and violent character, and had never known the happiness\r\nwhich is derived from the affection of another person. Monsieur de\r\nCarvajal, drunk with political passions, consumed by ambitious regrets,\r\nhad become the most cruel planter and the most disagreeable neighbor in\r\nthe colonies; his daughter had suffered keenly from his detestable\r\nhumor. But, by dint of watching the constant tableau of the evils of\r\nslavery, of enduring the weariness of solitude and dependence, she had\r\nacquired a superficial patience, proof against every trial, an adorable\r\nkindliness toward her inferiors, but also an iron will and an\r\nincalculable power of resistance to everything that tended to oppress\r\nher. By marrying Delmare she simply changed masters; by coming to live\r\nat Lagny, she changed her prison and the locus of her solitude. She did\r\nnot love her husband, perhaps for the very reason that she was told that\r\nit was her duty to love him, and that it had become with her a sort of\r\nsecond nature, a principle of conduct, a law of conscience, to resist\r\nmentally every sort of moral constraint. No one had attempted to point\r\nout to her any other law than that of blind obedience.\r\n\r\nBrought up in the desert, neglected by her father, surrounded by slaves,\r\nto whom she could offer no other assistance or encouragement than her\r\ncompassion and her tears, she had accustomed herself to say: "A day will\r\ncome when everything in my life will be changed, when I shall do good to\r\nothers, when some one will love me, when I shall give my whole heart to\r\nthe man who gives me his; meanwhile, I will suffer in silence and keep\r\nmy love as a reward for him who shall set me free." This liberator, this\r\nMessiah had not come; Indiana was still awaiting him. She no longer\r\ndared, it is true, to confess to herself her whole thought. She had\r\nrealized under the clipped hedge-rows of Lagny that thought itself was\r\nmore fettered there than under the wild palms of Ile Bourbon; and when\r\nshe caught herself saying, as she used to say: "A day will come--a man\r\nwill come"--she forced that rash longing back to the depths of her\r\nheart, and said to herself: "Death alone will bring that day!"\r\n\r\nAnd so she was dying. A strange malady was consuming her youth. She was\r\nwithout strength and unable to sleep. The doctors looked in vain for any\r\ndiscoverable disorder, for none existed; all her faculties were failing\r\naway in equal degree, all her organs were gradually degenerating; her\r\nheart was burning at a slow fire, her eyes were losing their lustre, the\r\ncirculation of her blood was governed entirely by excitement and fever;\r\na few months more and the poor captive bird would surely die. But,\r\nwhatever the extent of her resignation and her discouragement, the need\r\nremained the same. That silent, broken heart was still calling\r\ninvoluntarily to some generous youthful heart to revivify it. The being\r\nwhom she had loved most dearly hitherto was Noun, the cheery and brave\r\ncompanion of her tedious solitude; and the man who had manifested the\r\ngreatest liking for her was her phlegmatic cousin Sir Ralph. What food\r\nfor the all-consuming activity of her thoughts--a poor girl, ignorant\r\nand neglected like herself, and an Englishman whose only passion was\r\nfox-hunting!\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare was genuinely unhappy, and the first time that she felt\r\nthe burning breath of a young and passionate man enter her frigid\r\natmosphere, the first time that a tender and caressing word delighted\r\nher ear, and quivering lips left a mark as of a red-hot iron on her\r\nhand, she thought neither of the duties that had been laid upon her, nor\r\nof the prudence that had been enjoined upon her, nor of the future that\r\nhad been predicted for her; she remembered only the hateful past, her\r\nlong suffering, her despotic masters. Nor did it occur to her that the\r\nman before her might be false or fickle. She saw him as she wished him\r\nto be, as she had dreamed of him, and Raymon could easily have deceived\r\nher if he had not been sincere.\r\n\r\nBut how could he fail to be sincere with so lovely and loving a woman?\r\nWhat other had ever laid bare her heart to him with such candor and\r\ningenuousness? With what other had he been able to look forward to a\r\nfuture so captivating and so secure? Was she not born to love him, this\r\nslave who simply awaited a sign to break her chains, a word to follow\r\nhim? Evidently heaven had made for Raymon this melancholy child of Ile\r\nBourbon, whom no one had ever loved, and who but for him must have died.\r\n\r\nNevertheless a feeling of terror succeeded this all-pervading, feverish\r\njoy in Madame Delmare\'s heart. She thought of her quick-tempered,\r\nkeen-eyed, vindictive husband, and she was afraid,--not for herself, for\r\nshe was inured to threats, but for the man who was about to undertake a\r\nbattle to the death with her tyrant. She knew so little of society that\r\nshe transformed her life into a tragic romance; a timid creature, who\r\ndared not love for fear of endangering her lover\'s life, she gave no\r\nthought to the danger of destroying herself.\r\n\r\nThis then was the secret of her resistance, the motive of her virtue.\r\nShe made up her mind on the following day to avoid Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re.\r\nThat very evening there was a ball at the house of one of the leading\r\nbankers of Paris. Madame de Carvajal, who, being an old woman with no\r\nties of affection, was very fond of society, proposed to attend with\r\nIndiana; but Raymon was to be there and Indiana determined not to go. To\r\navoid her aunt\'s persecution, Madame Delmare, who was never able to\r\nresist except in action, pretended to assent to the plan; she allowed\r\nherself to be dressed and waited until Madame de Carvajal was ready;\r\nthen she changed her ball dress for a robe de chambre, seated herself in\r\nfront of the fire and resolutely awaited the conflict. When the old\r\nSpaniard, as rigid and gorgeous as a portrait by Van Dyck, came to call\r\nher, Indiana declared that she was not well and did not feel that she\r\ncould go out. In vain did her aunt urge her to make an effort.\r\n\r\n"I would be only too glad to go," she said, "but you see that I can\r\nhardly stand. I should be only a trouble to you to-night. Go to the ball\r\nwithout me, dear aunt; I shall enjoy the thought of your pleasure."\r\n\r\n"Go without you!" said Madame de Carvajal, who was sorely distressed at\r\nthe idea of having made an elaborate toilet to no purpose, and who\r\nshrank from the horrors of a solitary evening. "Why, what business have\r\nI in society, an old woman whom no one speaks to except to be near you?\r\nWhat will become of me without my niece\'s lovely eyes to give me value?"\r\n\r\n"Your wit will fill the gap, my dear aunt," said Indiana.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise de Carvajal, who only wanted to be urged, set off at last.\r\nWhereupon, Indiana hid her face in her hands and began to weep; for she\r\nhad made a great sacrifice and believed that she had already blasted the\r\nattractive prospect of the day before.\r\n\r\nBut Raymon would not have it so. The first thing that he saw at the ball\r\nwas the old marchioness\'s haughty aigrette. In vain did he look for\r\nIndiana\'s white dress and black hair in her vicinity. He drew near and\r\nheard her say in an undertone to another lady:\r\n\r\n"My niece is ill; or rather," she added, to justify her own presence at\r\nthe ball, "it\'s a mere girlish whim. She wanted to be left alone in the\r\nsalon with a book in her hand, like a sentimental beauty."\r\n\r\n"Can it be that she is avoiding me?" thought Raymon. He left the ball at\r\nonce. He hurried to the marchioness\'s house, entered without speaking to\r\nthe concierge, and asked the first servant that he saw, who was half\r\nasleep in the antechamber, for Madame Delmare.\r\n\r\n"Madame Delmare is ill."\r\n\r\n"I know it. I have come at Madame de Carvajal\'s request to see how she\r\nis."\r\n\r\n"I will tell madame."\r\n\r\n"It is not necessary. Madame Delmare will receive me."\r\n\r\nAnd Raymon entered the salon unannounced. All the other servants had\r\nretired. A melancholy silence reigned in the deserted apartments. A\r\nsingle lamp, covered with its green silk shade, lighted the main salon\r\ndimly. Indiana\'s back was turned to the door; she was completely hidden\r\nin the depths of a huge easy-chair, sadly watching the burning logs, as\r\non the evening when Raymon entered the park of Lagny over the wall;\r\nsadder now, for her former undefined sufferings, aimless desires had\r\ngiven place to a fleeting joy, a gleam of happiness that was not for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nRaymon, his feet encased in dancing shoes, approached noiselessly over\r\nthe soft, heavy carpet. He saw that she was weeping, and, when she\r\nturned her head, she found him at her feet, taking forcible possession\r\nof her hands, which she struggled in vain to withdraw from his clasp.\r\nThen, I agree, she was overjoyed beyond words to find that her scheme of\r\nresistance had failed. She felt that she passionately loved this man who\r\npaid no heed to obstacles and who had brought happiness to her in spite\r\nof her efforts. She blessed heaven for rejecting her sacrifice, and,\r\ninstead of scolding Raymon, she was very near thanking him.\r\n\r\nAs for him, he knew already that she loved him. He needed not to see the\r\njoy that shone through her tears to realize that he was master, and that\r\nhe could venture. He gave her no time to question him, but, changing\r\nr\xc3\xb4les with her, vouchsafing no explanation of his unlooked-for\r\npresence, and no apology intended to make him seem less guilty than he\r\nwas, he said:\r\n\r\n"You are weeping, Indiana. Why do you weep? I insist upon knowing."\r\n\r\nShe started when he called her by her name; but there was additional joy\r\nin the surprise which that audacity caused her.\r\n\r\n"Why do you ask?" she said. "I must not tell you."\r\n\r\n"Well, I know, Indiana. I know your whole history, your whole life.\r\nNothing that concerns you is unknown to me, because nothing that\r\nconcerns you is indifferent to me. I resolved to know everything about\r\nyou, and I have learned nothing that was not revealed to me during the\r\nbrief moment that I passed under your roof, when I was brought, all\r\ncrushed and bleeding, to your feet, and your husband was angry to see\r\nyou, so lovely and so kind, support me with your soft arms and pour balm\r\nupon my wounds with your sweet breath. He was jealous? oh! I can readily\r\nunderstand it; I should have been, in his place, Indiana; or rather, in\r\nhis place, I would kill myself; for to be your husband, madame, to\r\npossess you, to hold you in his arms, and not to deserve you, not to win\r\nyour heart, is to be the most miserable or the most dastardly of men!"\r\n\r\n"O heaven! hush," she cried, putting her hand over his mouth; "hush! for\r\nyou make me guilty. Why do you speak to me of him? why seek to teach me\r\nto curse him? If he should hear you! But I have said no evil of him; I\r\nhave not authorized you to commit this crime! I do not hate him; I\r\nesteem him, I love him!"\r\n\r\n"Say rather that you are horribly afraid of him; for the despot has\r\nbroken your spirit, and fear has sat at your bedside ever since you\r\nbecame that man\'s prey. You, Indiana, profaned by the touch of that\r\nboor, whose iron hand has bowed your head and ruined your life! Poor\r\nchild! so young and so lovely, to have suffered so horribly! for you\r\ncannot deceive me, Indiana, who look at you with other eyes than those\r\nof the common herd; I know all the secrets of your destiny, and you\r\ncannot hope to hide the truth from me. Let those who look at you because\r\nyou are lovely say, when they notice your pallor and your melancholy:\r\n\'She is ill;\'--well and good; but I, who follow you with my heart, whose\r\nwhole soul encompasses you with solicitude and love, I am well aware\r\nwhat your disease is. I know that, if God had willed it so, if he had\r\ngiven you to me, unlucky wretch that I am, who deserve to have my head\r\nbroken for having come so late, you would not be ill. On my life I\r\nswear, Indiana, I would have loved you so that you would have loved me\r\nthe same and that you would have blessed the chain that bound us. I\r\nwould have carried you in my arms to prevent your feet from being\r\nwounded; I would have warmed them with my breath. I would have held you\r\nagainst my breast to save you from suffering. I would have given all my\r\nblood to make up your lack of it, and if you had lost sleep with me, I\r\nwould have passed the night saying soft words to you, smiling on you to\r\nrestore your courage, weeping the while to see you suffer. When sleep\r\nhad breathed upon your silken eyelids, I would have brushed them with my\r\nlips to close them more softly, and I would have watched over you,\r\nkneeling by your bed. I would have forced the air to caress you gently,\r\ngolden dreams to throw flowers to you. I would have kissed noiselessly\r\nyour lovely tresses, I would have counted with ecstatic joy the\r\npalpitations of your breast, and, at your awakening, Indiana, you would\r\nhave found me at your feet, guarding you like a jealous master, waiting\r\nupon you as a slave, watching for your first smile, seizing upon your\r\nfirst thought, your first glance, your first kiss."\r\n\r\n"Enough! enough!" said Indiana, agitated and quivering with emotion,\r\n"you make me faint."\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if people died of happiness, Indiana would have died at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n"Do not speak so to me," she said--"to me who am destined never to be\r\nhappy; do not depict heaven upon earth to me who am doomed to die."\r\n\r\n"To die!" cried Raymon vehemently, seizing her in his arms; "you, die!\r\nIndiana! die before you have lived--before you have loved! No, you shall\r\nnot die; I will not let you die, for my life is bound to yours\r\nhenceforth. You are the woman of whom I dreamed, the purity that I\r\nadored, the chimera that always fled from me, the bright star that shone\r\nbefore me and said to me: \'Go forward in this life of wretchedness and\r\nheaven will send one of its angels to bear you company.\' You were always\r\ndestined for me; your soul was always betrothed to mine, Indiana! Men\r\nand their iron laws have disposed of you; they have snatched from me the\r\nmate God would have chosen for me, if God did not sometimes forget his\r\npromises. But what do we care for men and laws if I love you still in\r\nanother\'s arms, if you can still love me, accursed and unhappy as I am\r\nin having lost you! I tell you, Indiana, you belong to me; you are the\r\nhalf of my heart, which has long been struggling to join the other half.\r\nWhen you dreamed of a friend on Ile Bourbon, you dreamed of me; when, at\r\nthe word husband, a sweet thrill of fear and hope passed through your\r\nheart, it was because I was destined to be your husband. Do you not\r\nrecognize me? Does not it seem to you that we must have met twenty years\r\nago? Did I not recognize you, my angel, when you stanched my blood with\r\nyour veil, when you placed your hand on my dying heart to bring back its\r\nheat and its life? Ah! I remember distinctly enough. When I opened my\r\neyes I said to myself: \'There she is! she has been like that in all my\r\ndreams--pale, melancholy and kind-hearted. She is my own; it is she who\r\nis destined to fill my cup with unknown joys.\' And the physical life\r\nwhich returned to me then was your work. For we were brought together by\r\nno commonplace circumstances, you see; it was neither chance nor\r\ncaprice, but fatality, death, which opened the gates of this new life to\r\nme. It was your husband--your master--who, guided by his destiny,\r\nbrought me all bleeding in his arms and threw me at your feet, saying:\r\n\'Here is something for you!\' And now nothing can part us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he can part us!" hastily interposed Madame Delmare, who, carried\r\naway by her lover\'s transports, had listened to him in ecstasy. "Alas!\r\nalas! you do not know him; he is a man who knows nothing of pardon--a\r\nman who cannot be deceived. He will kill you, Raymon!"\r\n\r\nShe hid her face in his bosom, sobbing. Raymon embraced her\r\npassionately.\r\n\r\n"Let him come!" he cried; "let him come and snatch this moment of\r\nhappiness from me! I defy him! Stay here, Indiana--here against my\r\nheart; let it be your refuge and your protection. Love me and I shall be\r\ninvulnerable. You know that it is not in that man\'s power to kill me; I\r\nhave already been exposed defenceless to his blows. But you, my good\r\nangel, were hovering over me, and your wings protected me. Have no fear,\r\nI say, we shall find a way to turn aside his wrath; and now I am not\r\neven afraid for you, for I shall be at hand. And when this master of\r\nyours attempts to oppress you, I will protect you against him. I will\r\nrescue you, if necessary, from his cruel laws. Would you like me to kill\r\nhim? Tell me that you love me, and I will be his executioner if you\r\nsentence him to death."\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush! you make me shudder! If you wish to kill some one, kill me;\r\nfor I have lived one whole day and I ask nothing more."\r\n\r\n"Die, then, but let it be of happiness!" cried Raymon, pressing his lips\r\nto Indiana\'s.\r\n\r\nBut the storm was too severe for so fragile a plant; she turned pale,\r\nput her hand to her heart and swooned.\r\n\r\nAt first Raymon thought that his caresses would call her blood back into\r\nher icy veins; but in vain did he cover her hand with kisses; in vain\r\ndid he call her by the sweetest names. It was not a premeditated swoon\r\nof the sort we so often see. Madame Delmare had been seriously ill for a\r\nlong time, and was subject to nervous paroxysms which sometimes lasted\r\nwhole hours. Raymon, in desperation, was reduced to the necessity of\r\ncalling for help. He rang; a maid appeared; but the phial that she held\r\nescaped from her hands, and a cry from her throat, when she recognized\r\nRaymon. He, recovering instantly all his self-possession, put his mouth\r\nto her ear.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Noun! I knew that you were here and I came to see you. I did not\r\nexpect to see your mistress, who was, as I supposed, at the ball. When I\r\ncame in I frightened her and she fainted. Be prudent; I am going away."\r\n\r\nRaymon fled, leaving each of the two women in possession of a secret\r\nwhich was destined to carry despair to the heart of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Raymon, on waking, received a second letter from Noun.\r\nHe did not toss this one disdainfully aside; on the contrary, he opened\r\nit eagerly: it might have something to say of Madame Delmare. So, in\r\nfact, it did; but in what an embarrassing position this complication of\r\nintrigues placed Raymon! It had become impossible to conceal the girl\'s\r\nsecret. Already suffering and terror had thinned her cheeks. Madame\r\nDelmare observed her ailing condition, but was unable to discover its\r\ncause. Noun dreaded the colonel\'s severity, but she dreaded her\r\nmistress\'s gentleness even more. She was very sure that she would obtain\r\nforgiveness, but she would die of shame and grief in being forced to\r\nmake the confession. What would become of her if Raymon were not careful\r\nto protect her from the humiliations that were certain to overwhelm her!\r\nHe must give some thought to her, or she would throw herself at Madame\r\nDelmare\'s feet and tell her the whole story.\r\n\r\nThe fear of this result had a powerful effect upon Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re.\r\nHis first thought was to separate Noun from her mistress.\r\n\r\n"Be very careful not to speak without my consent," he wrote in reply.\r\n"Try and be in Lagny this evening. I will be there."\r\n\r\nOn his way thither he reflected as to the course he had better pursue.\r\nNoun had common sense enough not to expect a reparation--that was out of\r\nthe question. She had never dared to utter the word marriage, and\r\nbecause she was discreet and generous, Raymon deemed himself less\r\nguilty. He said to himself that he had not deceived her, and that Noun\r\nmust have foreseen what her fate must be. The cause of Raymon\'s\r\nembarrassment was not any hesitation about offering the poor girl half\r\nof his fortune; he was ready to enrich her, to take all the care of her\r\nthat the most sensitive delicacy could suggest. What made his position\r\nso painful was the necessity of telling her that he no longer loved her;\r\nfor he did not know how to dissemble. Although his conduct at this\r\ncrisis seems two-faced and treacherous, his heart was sincere, and had\r\nalways been. He had loved Noun with his senses; he loved Madame Delmare\r\nwith all his heart. Thus far he had lied to neither. His aim now was to\r\navoid beginning to lie, and Raymon felt equally incapable of deceiving\r\nNoun and of dealing her the fatal blow. He must make a choice between a\r\ncowardly and a barbarous act. Raymon was very unhappy. He had come to no\r\ndecision when he reached the gate of Lagny park.\r\n\r\nNoun, for her part, had not expected so prompt a reply, and had\r\nrecovered a little hope.\r\n\r\n"He still loves me," she said to herself, "he doesn\'t mean to abandon\r\nme. He had forgotten me a little, that\'s not to be wondered at; in\r\nParis, in the midst of merrymaking, with all the women in love with him,\r\nas they are sure to be, he has allowed himself to be led away from the\r\npoor creole for a few moments. Alas! who am I that he should sacrifice\r\nto me all those great ladies who are much lovelier and richer than I am?\r\nWho knows," she said to herself artlessly, "perhaps the Queen of France\r\nis in love with him!"\r\n\r\nBy dint of meditating upon the seductions which luxurious surroundings\r\nprobably exerted on her lover, Noun thought of a scheme for making\r\nherself more agreeable to him. She arrayed herself in her mistress\'s\r\nclothes, lighted a great fire in the room that Madame Delmare occupied\r\nat Lagny, decorated the mantel with the loveliest flowers she could find\r\nin the greenhouse, prepared a collation of fruit and choice wines, in a\r\nword resorted to all the dainty devices of the boudoir, of which she had\r\nnever thought before; and when she looked at herself in a great mirror,\r\nshe did herself no more than justice in deciding that she was fairer\r\nthan the flowers with which she had sought to embellish her charms.\r\n\r\n"He has often told me," she said to herself, "that I needed no ornaments\r\nto make me lovely, and that no woman at court, in all the splendor of\r\nher diamonds, was worth one of my smiles. And yet those same women that\r\nhe used to despise fill his thoughts now. Come, I must be cheerful, I\r\nmust seem lively and happy; perhaps I shall reconquer to-night all the\r\nlove I once aroused in him."\r\n\r\nRaymon, having left his horse at a charcoal-burner\'s cabin in the\r\nforest, entered the park, to which he had a key. This time he did not\r\nrun the risk of being taken for a thief; for almost all the servants had\r\ngone with their masters, he had taken the gardener into his confidence,\r\nand he knew all the approaches to Lagny as well as those to his own\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold night; the trees in the park were enveloped in a dense\r\nmist, and Raymon could hardly distinguish their black trunks through the\r\nwhite mist which swathed them in diaphanous robes. He wandered some time\r\nthrough the winding paths before he found the door of the summer-house\r\nwhere Noun awaited him. She was wrapped in a pelisse with the hood\r\nthrown over her head.\r\n\r\n"We cannot stay here," she said, "it is too cold. Follow me and do not\r\nspeak."\r\n\r\nRaymon felt an extreme reluctance to enter Madame Delmare\'s house as the\r\nlover of her maid. However, he could not but comply; Noun was walking\r\nlightly away in front of him, and this interview was to be the last.\r\n\r\nShe led him across the courtyard, quieted the dogs, opened the doors\r\nnoiselessly, and, taking his hand, guided him in silence through the\r\ndark corridors; at last she ushered him into a circular room, furnished\r\nsimply but with refinement, where flowering orange-bushes exhaled their\r\nsweet perfume; transparent wax candles were burning in the candelabra.\r\n\r\nNoun had strewn the floor with the petals of Bengal roses, the divan was\r\ncovered with violets, a subtle warmth entered at every pore, and the\r\nglasses gleamed on the table amid the fruit, whose ruddy cheeks were\r\ndaintily blended with green moss.\r\n\r\nDazzled by the sudden transition from darkness to brilliant light,\r\nRaymon stood for a moment bewildered; but it was not long ere he\r\nrealized where he was. The exquisite taste and chaste simplicity which\r\ncharacterized the furniture; the love stories and books of travel\r\nscattered over the mahogany shelves; the embroidery frame covered with a\r\nbright, pretty piece of work, the diversion of hours of patient\r\nmelancholy; the harp whose strings seemed still to quiver with strains\r\nof love and longing; the engravings representing the pastoral attachment\r\nof Paul and Virginie, the peaks of Ile Bourbon and the blue shores of\r\nSaint-Paul; and, above all, the little bed half-hidden behind its muslin\r\ncurtains, as white and modest as a maiden\'s bed, and over the headboard,\r\nby way of consecrated boxwood, a bit of palm, taken perhaps from some\r\ntree in her native island, on the day of her departure;--all these\r\nrevealed the presence of Madame Delmare, and Raymon was seized with a\r\nstrange thrill as he thought that that cloak-enveloped woman who had led\r\nhim thither might be Indiana herself. This extravagant supposition\r\nseemed to be confirmed when he saw, in the mirror opposite, a white\r\nfigure, the phantom of a woman entering a ball-room and laying aside her\r\ncloak, to appear, radiant and half-nude, in the dazzling light. But it\r\nwas only a momentary error--Indiana would have concealed her charms more\r\ncarefully; her modest bosom would have been visible only through the\r\ntriple gauze veil of her corsage; she would perhaps have dressed her\r\nhair with natural camellias, but they would not have frisked about on\r\nher head in such seductive disorder; she might have encased her feet in\r\nsatin shoes, but her chaste gown would not have betrayed thus\r\nshamelessly the mysteries of her shapely legs.\r\n\r\nTaller and more powerfully built than her mistress, Noun was dressed,\r\nnot clothed in her finery. She was graceful but lacked nobility of\r\nbearing; she was lovely with the loveliness of women, not of fairies;\r\nshe invited pleasure and gave no promise of sublime bliss.\r\n\r\nRaymon, after scrutinizing her in the mirror without turning his head,\r\nturned his eyes upon everything that was calculated to give forth a\r\npurer reflection of Indiana--the musical instruments, the paintings, the\r\nnarrow, maidenly bed. He was intoxicated by the vague perfume her\r\npresence had left behind in that sanctuary; he shuddered with desire as\r\nhe thought of the day when Indiana herself should throw open its\r\ndelights to him; and Noun, standing behind him with her arms folded,\r\ngazed ecstatically at him, fancying that he was overwhelmed with delight\r\nat the sight of all the pains she had taken to please him.\r\n\r\nBut he broke the silence at last.\r\n\r\n"I thank you," he said, "for all the preparations you have made for me;\r\nI thank you especially for bringing me here, but I have enjoyed this\r\npleasant surprise long enough. Let us leave this room; we are not in our\r\nproper place here, and I must have some respect for Madame Delmare, even\r\nin her absence."\r\n\r\n"That is very cruel," said Noun, who did not understand him, but\r\nremarked his cold and displeased manner; "it is very hard to have had\r\nsuch hopes of pleasing you and to see that you spurn me."\r\n\r\n"No, dear Noun, I shall never spurn you; I came here to have a serious\r\ntalk with you and to show you the deep affection that I owe you. I am\r\ngrateful for your desire to please me; but I loved you better adorned by\r\nyour youth and your natural charms than in this borrowed finery."\r\n\r\nNoun half understood and wept.\r\n\r\n"I am a miserable creature," she said; "I hate myself, for I no longer\r\nplease you. I should have foreseen that you would not love me long,\r\nbeing, as I am, a poor, uneducated girl. I do not reproach you for\r\nanything. I knew well enough that you would not marry me; but if you\r\nwould have kept on loving me, I would have sacrificed everything without\r\na regret, endured everything without complaining. Alas! I am ruined! I\r\nam dishonored! perhaps I shall be turned out-of-doors. I am going to\r\ngive life to a creature who will be even more unfortunate than I am, and\r\nno one will pity me. Everyone will feel that he has a right to trample\r\non me. But I would joyfully submit to all that, if you still loved me."\r\n\r\nNoun talked thus a long while. Perhaps she did not repeat the same\r\nwords, but she said the same things, and said them a hundred times more\r\neloquently than I can say them. Where are we to look for the secret of\r\nthe eloquence which suddenly reveals itself to an ignorant,\r\ninexperienced mind in the crisis of a genuine passion and a profound\r\nsorrow? At such times words have a greater value than in all the other\r\nscenes of life; at such times trivial words become sublime by reason of\r\nthe sentiment that dictates them and the accent with which they are\r\nspoken. At such times the woman of the lowest rank, abandoning herself\r\nto the frenzy of her emotions, becomes more pathetic and more convincing\r\nthan her to whom education has taught moderation and reserve.\r\n\r\nRaymon was flattered to find that he had inspired so generous an\r\nattachment, and gratitude, compassion, perhaps a little vanity,\r\nrekindled love for a moment.\r\n\r\nNoun was suffocated by her tears; she had torn the flowers from her hair\r\nwhich fell in disorder over her broad and dazzling shoulders. If Madame\r\nDelmare had not had her slavery and her sufferings to heighten her\r\ncharms, Noun would have surpassed her immeasurably in beauty at that\r\nmoment; she was resplendent with grief and love. Raymon was vanquished;\r\nhe drew her into his arms, made her sit beside him on the sofa, moved\r\nthe little decanter-laden table nearer to them, and poured a few drops\r\nof orange-flower water in a silver cup for her. Comforted by this mark\r\nof interest far more than by the calming potion, Noun wiped away her\r\ntears and threw herself at Raymon\'s feet.\r\n\r\n"Do love me," she said, passionately embracing his knees; "tell me that\r\nyou still love me and I shall be cured, I shall be saved. Kiss me as you\r\nused to, and I will not regret having ruined myself to give you a few\r\ndays of pleasure."\r\n\r\nShe threw her cool, brown arms about him, she covered him with her long\r\nhair; her great black eyes emitted a burning languor and betrayed that\r\nardor of the blood, that purely oriental lust which is capable of\r\ntriumphing over all the efforts of the will, all the chaste delicacy of\r\nthe thought. Raymon forgot everything--his resolutions, his new love and\r\nhis surroundings. He returned Noun\'s delirious caresses. He moistened\r\nhis lips at the same cup, and the heady wines which were close at hand\r\ncompleted the dethronement of their reason.\r\n\r\nLittle by little a vague and shadowy memory of Indiana was blended with\r\nRaymon\'s drunkenness. The two glass panels which repeated Noun\'s image\r\n_ad infinitum_ seemed to be peopled by a thousand phantoms. He gazed\r\ninto the depths of that multiple reflection, looking for a slenderer\r\nfigure there, and it seemed to him that he could distinguish, in the\r\nlast hazy and confused shadow of Noun\'s image the graceful and willowy\r\nform of Madame Delmare.\r\n\r\nNoun, herself bewildered by the strong liquors which she knew not how to\r\nuse, no longer noticed her lover\'s strange remarks. If she had not been\r\nas drunk as he, she would have understood that in his wildest flights\r\nRaymon was thinking of another woman. She would have seen him kiss the\r\nscarf and the ribbons Indiana had worn, inhale the perfume which\r\nreminded him of her, crumple in his burning hands the tissue that had\r\ncovered her breast; but Noun appropriated all these transports to\r\nherself, when Raymon saw naught of her but Indiana\'s dress. If he kissed\r\nher black hair, he fancied that he was kissing Indiana\'s black hair. It\r\nwas Indiana whom he saw in the fumes of the punch which Noun\'s hand had\r\nlighted; it was she who smiled upon him and beckoned him from behind\r\nthose white muslin curtains; and it was she of whom he dreamed upon that\r\nchaste and spotless bed, when, yielding to the influence of love and\r\nwine, he led thither his dishevelled creole.\r\n\r\nWhen Raymon woke, a sort of half light was shining through the cracks of\r\nthe shutters, and he lay a long while without moving, absorbed by a\r\nvague feeling of surprise and gazing at the room in which he was and the\r\nbed in which he had slept, as if they were a vision of his slumber.\r\nEverything in Madame Delmare\'s chamber had been put in order. Noun, who\r\nhad fallen asleep the sovereign mistress of that place, had waked in the\r\nmorning a lady\'s-maid once more. She had taken away the flowers and put\r\nthe remains of the collation out of sight; the furniture was all in\r\nplace, nothing suggested the amorous debauch of the night, and Indiana\'s\r\nchamber had resumed its innocent and virtuous aspect.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with shame, he rose and attempted to leave the room, but he\r\nwas locked in; the window was thirty feet from the ground, and he must\r\nneeds remain in that remorse-laden atmosphere, like Ixion on his wheel.\r\nThereupon he fell on his knees with his face toward that disarranged,\r\ntumbled bed which made him blush.\r\n\r\n"O Indiana!" he cried, wringing his hands, "how I have outraged you! Can\r\nyou ever forgive me for such infamous conduct? Even if you should\r\nforgive me, I can never forgive myself. Resist me now, my gentle,\r\ntrustful Indiana; for you do not know the baseness and brutality of the\r\nman to whom you would surrender the treasures of your innocence! Repulse\r\nme, trample on me, for I have not respected the sanctuary of your sacred\r\nmodesty; I have befuddled myself with your wine like a footman, sitting\r\nbeside your maid; I have sullied your spotless robe with my accursed\r\nbreath, and your chaste girdle with my infamous kisses on another\'s\r\nbreast; I have not shrunk from poisoning the repose of your lonely\r\nnights, and from shedding, even upon this bed, which your husband\r\nhimself respected, the influences of seduction and adultery! What safety\r\nwill you find henceforth behind these curtains whose mysteries I have\r\nnot shrunk from profaning? What impure dreams, what bitter and consuming\r\nthoughts will cling fast to your brain and wither it! What phantoms of\r\nvice and shamelessness will crawl upon the virginal linen of your couch!\r\nAnd your sleep, pure as a child\'s--what chaste divinity will care to\r\nprotect it now? Have I not put to flight the angel who guarded your\r\npillow? Have I not thrown your alcove open to the demon of lust? Have I\r\nnot sold him your soul? And will not the insane passion which consumes\r\nthe vitals of this lascivious creole cling to yours, like Dejanira\'s\r\nrobe and gnaw at them! Oh! miserable wretch! miserable, guilty wretch\r\nthat I am! if only I could wash away with my blood the stain I have left\r\non this couch!"\r\n\r\nAnd Raymon sprinkled it with his tears.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Noun returned, in her neckerchief and apron; she fancied,\r\nwhen she saw Raymon kneeling, that he was praying. She did not know that\r\nsociety people do not pray. She stood waiting in silence, until he\r\nshould deign to notice her presence.\r\n\r\nRaymon, when he saw her, had a feeling of embarrassment and irritation,\r\nbut without the courage to scold her, without the strength to say a\r\nfriendly word to her.\r\n\r\n"Why did you lock me in this room?" he said at last. "Do you forget that\r\nit is broad daylight and that I cannot go out without compromising you\r\nopenly?"\r\n\r\n"So you\'re not to go out," said Noun caressingly. "The house is deserted\r\nand no one can see you; the gardener never comes to this part of the\r\nbuilding to which I alone have the keys. You must stay with me all day;\r\nyou are my prisoner."\r\n\r\nThis arrangement drove Raymon to despair; he had no other feeling for\r\nhis mistress than a sort of aversion. However, he could do nothing but\r\nsubmit, and it may be that, notwithstanding what he suffered in that\r\nroom, an invincible attraction detained him there.\r\n\r\nWhen Noun left him to go and find something for breakfast, he set about\r\nexamining by daylight all those dumb witnesses of Indiana\'s solitude. He\r\nopened her books, turned the leaves of her albums, then closed them\r\nprecipitately; for he still shrank from committing a profanation and\r\nviolating some feminine mystery. At last he began to pace the room and\r\nnoticed, on the wooden panel opposite Madame Delmare\'s bed, a large\r\npicture, richly framed and covered with a double thickness of gauze.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was Indiana\'s portrait. Raymon, in his eagerness to see it,\r\nforgot his scruples, stepped on a chair, removed the pins, and was\r\namazed to see a full-length portrait of a handsome young man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"It seems to me that I know that face," he said to Noun, struggling to\r\nassume an indifferent attitude.\r\n\r\n"Fi! monsieur," said the girl, as she placed on a table the tray that\r\nshe brought containing the breakfast; "it is not right to try and find\r\nout my mistress\'s secrets."\r\n\r\nThis remark made Raymon turn pale.\r\n\r\n"Secrets!" he said. "If this is a secret, it has been confided to you,\r\nNoun, and you were doubly guilty in bringing me to this room."\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, it\'s not a secret," said Noun with a smile; "for Monsieur\r\nDelmare himself assisted in hanging Sir Ralph\'s portrait on that panel.\r\nAs if madame could have any secrets with a husband so jealous!"\r\n\r\n"Sir Ralph, you say? Who is Sir Ralph?"\r\n\r\n"Sir Rodolphe Brown, madame\'s cousin, her playmate in childhood, and my\r\nown, too, I might say; he is such a good man!"\r\n\r\nRaymon scrutinized the picture with surprise and some uneasiness.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Sir Ralph was an extremely comely person, physically;\r\nwith a red and white complexion and abundant hair, a tall figure, always\r\nperfectly dressed, and capable, if not of turning a romantic brain, of\r\nsatisfying the vanity of an unromantic one. The peaceable baronet was\r\nrepresented in hunting costume, about as we saw him in the first chapter\r\nof this narrative, and surrounded by his dogs, the beautiful pointer\r\nOphelia in the foreground, because of the fine silver-gray tone of her\r\nsilky coat and the purity of her Scotch blood. Sir Ralph had a\r\nhunting-horn in one hand and in the other the rein of a superb,\r\ndapple-gray English hunter, who filled almost the whole background of\r\nthe picture. It was an admirably executed portrait, a genuine family\r\npicture with all its perfection of detail, all its puerile niceties of\r\nresemblance, all its bourgeois minuti\xc3\xa6; a picture to make a nurse weep,\r\ndogs bark and a tailor faint with joy. There was but one thing on earth\r\nmore insignificant than the portrait, and that was the original.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it kindled a violent flame of wrath in Raymon.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word!" he said to himself, "this dapper young Englishman enjoys\r\nthe privilege of being admitted to Madame Delmare\'s most secret\r\napartment! His vapid face is always here, looking coldly on at the most\r\nprivate acts of her life! He watches her, guards her, follows her every\r\nmovement, possesses her every hour in the day! At night he watches her\r\nasleep and surprises the secret of her dreams; in the morning, when she\r\ncomes forth, all white and quivering, from her bed, he sees the dainty\r\nbare foot that steps lightly on the carpet; and when she dresses with\r\nall precaution--when she draws the curtains at her window and forbids\r\neven the daylight from entering her presence too boldly--when she\r\nbelieves that she is quite alone, hidden from every eye--that insolent\r\nface is there, feasting on her charms! That man, all booted and spurred,\r\npresides over her toilet. Is this gauze usually spread over the\r\npicture?" he asked the maid.\r\n\r\n"Always," she replied, "when madame is absent. But don\'t take the\r\ntrouble to replace it, for madame is coming in a few days."\r\n\r\n"In that case, Noun, you would do well to tell her that the expression\r\nof the face is very impertinent. If I had been in Monsieur Delmare\'s\r\nplace I wouldn\'t have consented to leave it here unless I had cut out\r\nthe eyes. But that\'s just like the stupid jealousy of the ordinary\r\nhusband! They imagine everything and understand nothing."\r\n\r\n"For heaven\'s sake, what have you against good Monsieur Brown\'s face?"\r\nsaid Noun, as she made her mistress\'s bed; "he is such an excellent\r\nmaster! I used not to care much for him, because I always heard madame\r\nsay that he was selfish; but ever since the day that he took care of\r\nyou----"\r\n\r\n"True," Raymon interrupted her, "it was he who helped me that day; I\r\nremember him perfectly now. But I owe his interest only to Madame\r\nDelmare\'s prayers."\r\n\r\n"Because she is so kind-hearted," said poor Noun. "Who could help being\r\nkind-hearted after living with her?"\r\n\r\nWhen Noun spoke of Madame Delmare, Raymon listened with an interest of\r\nwhich she had no suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe day passed quietly enough, but Noun dared not lead the conversation\r\nto her real object. At last, toward evening, she made an effort and\r\ncompelled him to declare his intentions.\r\n\r\nRaymon had no other intention than to rid himself of a dangerous witness\r\nand of a woman whom he no longer loved. But he proposed to assure her\r\nfuture, and in fear and trembling he made her the most liberal offers.\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter affront to the poor girl; she tore her hair, and would\r\nhave beaten her head against the wall if Raymon had not put forth all\r\nhis strength to hold her. Thereupon, employing all the resources of\r\nlanguage and intellect with which nature had endowed him, he made her\r\nunderstand that it was not for her, but for the child she was to bring\r\ninto the world, that he desired to make provision.\r\n\r\n"It is my duty," he said; "I hand the funds over to you as the child\'s\r\nheritage, and you would fail in your duty to him if a false sense of\r\ndelicacy should lead you to reject them."\r\n\r\nNoun became calmer and wiped her eyes.\r\n\r\n"Very well," she said, "I will accept the money if you will promise to\r\nkeep on loving me; for, just by doing your duty to the child, you will\r\nnot do it to the mother. Your gift will keep him alive, but your\r\nindifference will kill me. Can\'t you take me into your service? I am not\r\nexacting; I don\'t aspire to all that another woman in my place might\r\nhave had the skill to obtain. But let me be your servant. Obtain a place\r\nfor me in your mother\'s family. She will be satisfied with me, I give\r\nyou my word; and, even if you don\'t love me, I shall at least see you."\r\n\r\n"What you ask is impossible, my dear Noun. In your present condition you\r\ncannot think of entering anyone\'s service; and to deceive my mother--to\r\nplay upon her confidence in me--would be a base act to which I shall\r\nnever consent. Go to Lyon or Bordeaux; I will undertake to see to it\r\nthat you want nothing until such time as you can show yourself again.\r\nThen I will obtain a place for you with some one of my acquaintances--at\r\nParis, if you wish, if you insist upon being near me--but as to living\r\nunder the same roof, that is impossible."\r\n\r\n"Impossible!" echoed Noun, wringing her hands in a passion of grief. "I\r\nsee that you despise me--that you blush for me. But no, I will not go\r\naway, alone and degraded, to die abandoned in some distant city where\r\nyou will forget me. What do I care for my reputation? Your love is what\r\nI wanted to retain."\r\n\r\n"Noun, if you fear that I am deceiving you, come with me. The same\r\ncarriage shall take us to whatever place you choose. I will go with you\r\nanywhere, except to Paris or to my mother\'s, and I will bestow upon you\r\nall the care and attention that I owe you."\r\n\r\n"Yes, to abandon me on the day after you have put me down, a useless\r\nburden, in some foreign land!" she rejoined, smiling bitterly. "No,\r\nmonsieur, no, I will stay here; I do not choose to lose everything at\r\nonce. I should sacrifice, by following you, the person whom I loved best\r\nin the world before I knew you; but I am not anxious enough to conceal\r\nmy dishonor to sacrifice both my love and my friendship. I will go and\r\nthrow myself at Madame Delmare\'s feet; I will tell her all, and she will\r\nforgive me, I know, for she is kind and she loves me. We were born on\r\nalmost the same day, and she is my foster-sister. We have never been\r\nseparated, and she will not want me to leave her. She will weep with me;\r\nshe will take care of me, and she will love my child--my poor child! Who\r\nknows! she has not the good fortune to be a mother; perhaps she will\r\nbring it up as her own! Ah! I was mad to think of leaving her, for she\r\nis the only person on earth who will take pity on me!"\r\n\r\nThis determination plunged Raymon in horrible perplexity; but suddenly\r\nthe rumbling of a carriage was heard in the courtyard. Noun, in dismay,\r\nran to the window.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Madame Delmare!" she cried; "go instantly!"\r\n\r\nIn that moment of excitement the key to the secret staircase could not\r\nbe found. Noun took Raymon\'s arm and hurriedly pulled him into the hall;\r\nbut they were not half way to the stairs when they heard footsteps in\r\nthe same passage; they heard Madame Delmare\'s voice ten steps in front\r\nof them, and a candle carried by a servant who attended her cast its\r\nflickering light almost on their terrified faces. Noun had barely time\r\nto retrace her steps, still pulling Raymon after her, and to return with\r\nhim to the bedroom.\r\n\r\nA dressing room, with a glass door, might afford a place of refuge for a\r\nfew moments; but there was no way of locking the door, and it was\r\npossible that Madame Delmare might go to the dressing room at once. To\r\navoid being detected instantly, Raymon was obliged to rush into the\r\nalcove and hide behind the curtains. It was not probable that Madame\r\nDelmare would retire at once, and meanwhile Noun might find an\r\nopportunity to help him to escape.\r\n\r\nIndiana bustled into the room, tossed her hat on the bed and kissed Noun\r\nwith the familiarity of a sister. There was so little light in the room\r\nthat she did not notice her companion\'s emotion.\r\n\r\n"You expected me, did you?" she said, going to the fire; "how did you\r\nknow I was coming?--Monsieur Delmare," she added, not waiting for a\r\nreply, "will be here to-morrow. I started at once on receiving his\r\nletter. I have certain reasons for receiving him here and not in Paris.\r\nI will tell you what they are. But, in heaven\'s name, why don\'t you\r\nspeak to me? you don\'t seem so glad to see me as usual."\r\n\r\n"I am low-spirited," said Noun, kneeling by her mistress to remove her\r\nshoes. "I have something to tell you, too, but later; come to the salon\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"God forbid! what an idea! it\'s deathly cold there!"\r\n\r\n"No, there\'s a good fire."\r\n\r\n"You are dreaming! I just came through it."\r\n\r\n"But your supper is waiting for you."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t want any supper; besides, there is nothing ready. Go and get my\r\nboa, I left it in the carriage."\r\n\r\n"In a moment."\r\n\r\n"Why not now? Go, I say, go!"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, she pushed Noun toward the door with a playful air; and\r\nthe maid, seeing that she must be bold and self-possessed, went out for\r\na few moments. But she had no sooner left the room than Madame Delmare\r\nthrew the bolt and removed her cloak, placing it on the bed beside her\r\nhat. As she did it, she went so near to Raymon, that he instinctively\r\nstepped back, and the bed, which apparently rested on well-oiled\r\ncastors, moved with a slight noise. Madame Delmare was surprised but not\r\nfrightened, for it was quite possible that she had herself moved the\r\nbed; she stretched forth her neck, drew the curtain aside and revealed a\r\nman\'s head outlined against the wall in the half-light cast by the fire\r\non the hearth.\r\n\r\nIn her terror she uttered a shriek and rushed to the mantel to seize the\r\nbell-cord and summon help. Raymon would have preferred to be taken for a\r\nthief again than to be recognized in that situation. But if he did not\r\nmake himself known, Madame Delmare would call her servants and\r\ncompromise her own reputation. He placed his trust in the love he had\r\ninspired in her, and, rushing to her, tried to stop her shrieks and to\r\nkeep her away from the bell-cord, saying to her in an undertone, for\r\nfear of being heard by Noun, who was probably not far away:\r\n\r\n"It is I, Indiana; look at me and forgive me! Indiana! forgive an\r\nunhappy wretch whose reason you have led astray, and who could not make\r\nup his mind to give you back to your husband until he had seen you once\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nAnd while he held Indiana in his arms, no less in the hope of moving her\r\nthan to keep her from ringing, Noun was knocking at the door in an agony\r\nof apprehension. Madame Delmare, extricating herself from Raymon\'s arms,\r\nran and opened the door, then sank into a chair.\r\n\r\nPale as death and almost fainting, Noun threw herself against the door\r\nto prevent the servants, who were running hither and thither, from\r\ninterrupting this strange scene; paler than her mistress, with trembling\r\nknees and her back glued to the door, she awaited her fate.\r\n\r\nRaymon felt that with due address he might still deceive both women at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n"Madame," he said, falling on his knees before Indiana, "my presence\r\nhere must seem to you an outrageous insult; here at your feet I implore\r\nyour forgiveness. Grant me an interview of a few moments and I will\r\nexplain----"\r\n\r\n"Hush, monsieur, and leave this house," cried Madame Delmare, recovering\r\nall the dignity befitting her situation; "leave this house openly. Open\r\nthe door, Noun, and allow monsieur to go, so that all my servants may\r\nsee him and that the disgrace of such a proceeding may fall upon him."\r\n\r\nNoun, believing that she was detected, threw herself on her knees by\r\nRaymon\'s side. Madame Delmare looked at her in amazement, but said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nRaymon tried to take her hand; but she indignantly withdrew it. Flushed\r\nwith anger, she rose and pointed to the door.\r\n\r\n"Go, I tell you!" she said; "go, for your conduct is despicable. So\r\nthese are the means you chose to employ! you, monsieur, hiding in my\r\nbedroom, like a thief! It seems that it is a habit of yours to introduce\r\nyourself into families in this way! and this is the pure attachment that\r\nyou offered me the night before last! This is the way you were to\r\nprotect me, respect me and defend me! This is the way you worship me!\r\nYou see a woman who has nursed you with her hands, who, to restore you\r\nto life, defied her husband\'s anger; you deceive her by a pretence of\r\ngratitude, you promise her a love worthy of her, and as a reward for her\r\nattentions, as the price of her credulity, you seek to surprise her in\r\nher sleep and to hasten your triumph by indescribable infamy! You bribe\r\nher maid, you almost creep into her bed, like a lover already favored;\r\nyou do not shrink from admitting her servants to the secret of an\r\nintimacy that does not exist. Go, monsieur; you have taken pains to\r\nundeceive me very quickly! Go, I say! do not remain another moment under\r\nmy roof! And you, wretched girl, who have so little regard for your\r\nmistress\'s honor--you deserve to be dismissed. Stand away from that\r\ndoor, I tell you!"\r\n\r\nNoun, half dead with surprise and despair, gazed fixedly at Raymon as if\r\nto ask him for an explanation of this incredible mystery. Then, with a\r\nwild gleam in her eyes, hardly able to stand, she dragged herself to\r\nIndiana and seized her arm fiercely.\r\n\r\n"What was that you said?" she cried, her teeth clenched with rage; "this\r\nman loved you?"\r\n\r\n"Eh! you must have known that he did!" said Madame Delmare, pushing her\r\naway contemptuously and with all her strength; "you must have known what\r\nreasons a man has for hiding behind a woman\'s curtains. Ah! Noun," she\r\nadded, noticing the girl\'s evident despair, "it was a dastardly thing,\r\nand one of which I would never have believed you to be capable; you\r\nconsented to sell her honor who had such perfect faith in yours!"\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare was shedding tears, tears of indignation as well as of\r\ngrief. Raymon had never seen her so lovely; but he hardly dared look at\r\nher, for her haughty air, the air of an insulted woman, forced him to\r\nlower his eyes. He was terror-stricken, too, petrified by Noun\'s\r\npresence. If he had been alone with Madame Delmare, he might perhaps\r\nhave been able to soften her. But Noun\'s expression was terrifying; her\r\nfeatures were distorted by rage and hatred.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door startled them all three. Noun rushed forward once\r\nmore to keep out intruders; but Madame Delmare, pushing her aside\r\nimperatively, motioned to Raymon to withdraw to the corner of the room.\r\nThen, with the self-possession which made her so remarkable at critical\r\nmoments, she wrapped herself in a shawl, partly opened the door herself,\r\nand asked the servant who had knocked what he had to say to her.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur Rodolphe Brown is here," was the reply; "he wishes to know if\r\nmadame will receive him."\r\n\r\n"Say to Monsieur Rodolphe Brown that I am delighted that he has come and\r\nthat I will join him at once. Make a fire in the salon and bid them\r\nprepare some supper. One moment! Go and get the key to the small park."\r\n\r\nThe servant retired. Madame Delmare remained at the door, holding it\r\nopen, not deigning to listen to Noun and imperiously enjoining silence\r\non Raymon.\r\n\r\nThe servant returned in a few moments. Madame Delmare, still holding the\r\ndoor open between him and Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re, took the key from him,\r\nbade him hurry up the supper, and, as soon as he had gone, turned to\r\nRaymon.\r\n\r\n"The arrival of my cousin, Sir Rodolphe Brown," she said, "saves you\r\nfrom the public scandal which I intended to inflict on you; he is a man\r\nof honor, who would eagerly assume the duty of defending me; but as I\r\nshould be very sorry to expose a man like him to danger at the hands of\r\nsuch a man as you, I will allow you to go without scandal. Noun, who\r\nadmitted you, will find a way to let you out. Go!"\r\n\r\n"We shall meet again, madame," replied Raymon with an attempt at\r\nself-assurance; "and although I am culpable, you will perhaps regret the\r\nharshness with which you treat me now."\r\n\r\n"I trust, monsieur, that we shall never meet again," she rejoined.\r\n\r\nAnd still standing at the door, not deigning to bow, she watched him\r\ndepart with his miserable and trembling accomplice.\r\n\r\nWhen he was alone with Noun in the obscurity of the park, Raymon\r\nexpected reproaches from her; but she did not speak to him. She led him\r\nto the gate of the small park, and, when he tried to take her hand, she\r\nhad already vanished. He called her in a low voice, for he was anxious\r\nto learn his fate; but she did not reply, and the gardener, suddenly\r\nappearing, said to him:\r\n\r\n"Come, monsieur, you must be off; madame is here and you may be\r\ndiscovered."\r\n\r\nRaymon took his departure with death in his heart; but in his despair at\r\nhaving offended Madame Delmare he almost forgot Noun and thought of\r\nnothing but possible methods of appeasing her mistress; for it was a\r\npart of his nature to be irritated by obstacles and never to cling\r\npassionately except to things that were well-nigh desperate.\r\n\r\nAt night, when Madame Delmare, after supping silently with Sir Ralph,\r\nwithdrew to her own apartments, Noun did not come, as usual, to undress\r\nher; she rang for her to no purpose, and when she had concluded that the\r\ngirl was resolved not to obey, she locked her door and went to bed. But\r\nshe passed a horrible night, and, as soon as the day broke, went down\r\ninto the park. She was feverish and agitated; she longed to feel the\r\ncold enter her body and allay the fire that consumed her breast. The day\r\nbefore, at that hour, she was happy, abandoning herself to the novel\r\nsensations of that intoxicating love. What a ghastly disillusionment in\r\ntwenty-four hours! First of all, the news of her husband\'s return\r\nseveral days earlier than she expected; those four or five days which\r\nshe had hoped to pass in Paris were to her a whole lifetime of\r\nnever-ending bliss, a dream of love never to be interrupted by an\r\nawakening; but in the morning she had had to abandon the hope, to resume\r\nthe yoke, and to go to meet her master in order that he might not meet\r\nRaymon at Madame de Carvajal\'s; for Indiana thought that it would be\r\nimpossible for her to deceive her husband if he should see her in\r\nRaymon\'s presence. And then this Raymon, whom she loved as a god--it was\r\nby him of all men that she was thus basely insulted! And lastly, her\r\nlife-long companion, the young creole whom she loved so dearly, suddenly\r\nproved to be unworthy of her confidence and her esteem!\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare had wept all night long. She sank upon the turf, still\r\nwhitened by the morning rime, on the bank of the little stream that\r\nflowed through the park. It was late in March and nature was beginning\r\nto awake; the morning, although cold, was not devoid of beauty; patches\r\nof mist still rested on the water like a floating scarf, and the birds\r\nwere trying their first songs of love and springtime.\r\n\r\nIndiana felt as if relieved of a heavy weight, and a wave of religious\r\nfeeling overflowed her soul.\r\n\r\n"God willed it so," she said to herself; "in His providence he has given\r\nme a harsh lesson, but it is fortunate for me. That man would perhaps\r\nhave led me into vice, he would have ruined me; whereas now the vileness\r\nof his sentiments is revealed to me, and I shall be on my guard against\r\nthe tempestuous and detestable passion that fermented in his breast. I\r\nwill love my husband! I will try to love him! At all events I will be\r\nsubmissive to him, I will make him happy by never annoying him, I will\r\navoid whatever can possibly arouse his jealousy; for now I know what to\r\nthink of the false eloquence that men know how to lavish on us. I shall\r\nbe fortunate, perhaps, if God will take pity on my sorrows and send\r\ndeath to me soon."\r\n\r\nThe clatter of the mill-wheel that started the machinery in Monsieur\r\nDelmare\'s factory made itself heard behind the willows on the other\r\nbank. The river, rushing through the newly opened gates, began to boil\r\nand bubble on the surface; and, as Madame Delmare followed with a\r\nmelancholy eye the swift rush of the stream, she saw floating among the\r\nreeds something like a bundle of cloth which the current strove to hurry\r\nalong in its train. She rose, leaned over the bank and distinctly saw a\r\nwoman\'s clothes,--clothes that she knew too well. Terror nailed her to\r\nthe spot; but the stream flowed on, slowly drawing a body from the reeds\r\namong which it had caught, and bringing it toward Madame Delmare.\r\n\r\nA piercing shriek attracted the workmen from the factory to the spot;\r\nMadame Delmare had fainted on the bank, and Noun\'s body was floating in\r\nthe water at her feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months have passed. Nothing is changed at Lagny, in that house to\r\nwhich I introduced you one winter evening, except that all about its red\r\nbrick walls with their frame of gray stone and its slated roofs yellowed\r\nby venerable moss, the springtime is in its bloom. The family is\r\nscattered here and there, enjoying the mild and fragrant evening air;\r\nthe setting sun gilds the window-panes and the roar of the factory\r\nmingles with the various noises of the farm. Monsieur Delmare is seated\r\non the steps, gun in hand, practising at shooting swallows on the wing.\r\nIndiana, at her embroidery frame near the window of the salon, leans\r\nforward now and then to watch with a sad face the colonel\'s cruel\r\namusement in the courtyard. Ophelia leaps about and barks, indignant at\r\na style of hunting so contrary to her habits; and Sir Ralph, astride the\r\nstone railing, is smoking a cigar and, as usual, looking on impassively\r\nat other people\'s pleasure or vexation.\r\n\r\n"Indiana," cried the colonel, laying aside his gun, "do for heaven\'s\r\nsake put your work away; you tire yourself out as if you were paid so\r\nmuch an hour."\r\n\r\n"It is still broad daylight," Madame Delmare replied.\r\n\r\n"No matter; come to the window, I have something to tell you."\r\n\r\nIndiana obeyed, and the colonel, drawing near the window, which was\r\nalmost on a level with the ground, said to her with as near an approach\r\nto playfulness of manner as an old and jealous husband can manage:\r\n\r\n"As you have worked hard to-day and as you are very good, I am going to\r\ntell you something that will please you."\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare struggled hard to smile; her smile would have driven a\r\nmore sensitive man than the colonel to despair.\r\n\r\n"You will be pleased to know," he continued, "that I have invited one of\r\nyour humble adorers to breakfast with you to-morrow, to divert you. You\r\nwill ask me which one; for you have a very pretty collection of them,\r\nyou flirt!"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s our dear old cur\xc3\xa9?" said Madame Delmare, whose melancholy\r\nwas enhanced by her husband\'s gayety.\r\n\r\n"Oh! no, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Then it must be the mayor of Chailly or the old notary from\r\nFontainebleau."\r\n\r\n"Oh! the craft of women! You know very well that it would be none of\r\nthose people. Come, Ralph, tell madame the name she has on the tip of\r\nher tongue but doesn\'t choose to pronounce herself."\r\n\r\n"You need not go through so much preparation to announce a visit from\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re," said Sir Ralph, tranquilly, as he threw away his\r\ncigar; "I suppose that it\'s a matter of perfect indifference to her."\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare felt the blood rush to her cheeks; she made a pretence of\r\nlooking for something in the salon, then returned to the window with as\r\ncalm a manner as she could command.\r\n\r\n"I fancy that this is a jest," she said, trembling in every limb.\r\n\r\n"On the contrary I am perfectly serious; you will see him here at eleven\r\no\'clock to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"What! the man who stole into your premises to obtain unfair possession\r\nof your invention, and whom you almost killed as a criminal! You must\r\nboth be very pacific to forget such grievances!"\r\n\r\n"You set me the example, dearest, by receiving him very graciously at\r\nyour aunt\'s, where he called on you."\r\n\r\nIndiana turned pale.\r\n\r\n"I do not by any means appropriate that call," she said earnestly, "and\r\nI am so little flattered by it that, if I were in your place, I would\r\nnot receive him."\r\n\r\n"You women are all false and cunning just for the pleasure of being so.\r\nYou danced with him during one whole ball, I was told."\r\n\r\n"You were misinformed."\r\n\r\n"Why, it was your aunt herself who told me! However, you need not defend\r\nyourself so warmly; I have no fault to find, as your aunt desired and\r\nassisted to bring about this reconciliation between us. Monsieur de\r\nRami\xc3\xa8re has been seeking it for a long while. He has rendered me some\r\nvery valuable services with respect to my business, and he has done it\r\nwithout ostentation and almost without my knowledge; so, as I am not so\r\nsavage as you say, and also as I do not choose to be under obligations\r\nto a stranger, I determined to make myself square with him."\r\n\r\n"How so?"\r\n\r\n"By making a friend of him; by going to Cercy this morning with Sir\r\nRalph. We found his mother there, who seems a delightful woman; and the\r\nhouse is furnished with refinement and comfort, but without ostentation\r\nand without a trace of the pride that attaches to venerable names. After\r\nall, this Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s a good fellow, and I have invited him to come and\r\nbreakfast with us and inspect the factory. I hear favorable accounts of\r\nhis brother, and I have made sure that he cannot injure me by adopting\r\nthe same methods that I use; so I prefer that that family should profit\r\nby them rather than any other. You see no secrets are kept very long,\r\nand mine will soon be like a stage secret if progress in manufacturing\r\ncontinues at the present rate."\r\n\r\n"For my part," said Sir Ralph, "I have always disapproved of this\r\nsecrecy, as you know; a good citizen\'s discovery belongs to his country\r\nas much as to himself, and if I----"\r\n\r\n"_Parbleu!_ that is just like you, Sir Ralph, with your practical\r\nphilanthropy! You will make me think that your fortune doesn\'t belong to\r\nyou, and that, if the nation takes a fancy to it to-morrow, you are\r\nready to exchange your fifty thousand francs a year for a wallet and\r\nstaff! It looks well for a buck like you, who are as fond of the\r\ncomforts of life as a sultan, to preach contempt of wealth!"\r\n\r\n"What I say," rejoined Sir Ralph, "is not meant to be philanthropic at\r\nall; my point is that selfishness properly understood leads us to do\r\ngood to others to prevent them injuring us. I am selfish myself, as\r\neverybody knows. I have accustomed myself not to blush for it, and,\r\nafter analyzing all the virtues, I find personal interest at the\r\nfoundation of them all. Love and devotion, which are two apparently\r\ngenerous passions, are perhaps the most selfish passions that exist; nor\r\nis patriotism less so, my word for it. I care little for men; but not\r\nfor anything in the world would I undertake to prove it to them, my fear\r\nof them is inversely proportional to my esteem for them. We are both\r\nselfish therefore but I admit it, whereas you deny it."\r\n\r\nA discussion arose between them wherein each sought by all the arguments\r\nof selfishness to demonstrate the selfishness of the others. Madame\r\nDelmare took advantage of it to retire to her room and to abandon\r\nherself to all the reflections to which news so entirely unexpected\r\nnaturally gave birth.\r\n\r\nIt will be well not only to admit you to the secret of her thoughts, but\r\nalso to enlighten you as to the situation of the various persons whom\r\nNoun\'s death had affected in greater or less degree.\r\n\r\nIt is almost proven, so far as the reader and I myself are concerned,\r\nthat that unfortunate creature threw herself into the stream through\r\ndespair, in one of those moments of frenzy when extreme resolutions are\r\nmost easily formed. But, as she evidently did not return to the house\r\nafter leaving Raymon--as no one had met her and had an opportunity to\r\ndivine her purpose--there was no indication of suicide to throw light\r\nupon the mystery of her death.\r\n\r\nTwo persons were in a position to attribute it with moral certainty to\r\nher own act--Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re and the gardener of Lagny. The grief\r\nof the former was concealed beneath a pretence of illness; the terror\r\nand remorse of the other enjoined silence upon him. This man who, from\r\ncupidity, had connived at the intercourse of the lovers throughout the\r\nwinter, was the only person who had been in a position to remark the\r\nyoung creole\'s secret misery. Justly fearing the reproaches of his\r\nemployers and the criticisms of his equals, he held his peace in his own\r\ninterest; and when Monsieur Delmare, who had some suspicions after the\r\ndiscovery of this intrigue, questioned him as to the lengths to which it\r\nhad been carried during his absence, he boldly denied that it had\r\ncontinued at all. Some people in the neighborhood--a very lonely\r\nneighborhood, by the way--had noticed Noun walking toward Crecy at\r\nunreasonable hours; but apparently there had been no relations between\r\nher and Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re since the end of January, and her death\r\noccurred on the 28th of March. So far as appeared, her death was\r\nattributable to chance; as she was walking through the park at\r\nnightfall, she might have been deceived by the dense fog that had\r\nprevailed for several days, have lost her way and missed the English\r\nbridge over the stream, which was quite narrow but had very steep banks\r\nand was swollen by recent rains.\r\n\r\nAlthough Sir Ralph, who was more observant than his reflections\r\nindicated, had found in his private thoughts grounds for strong\r\nsuspicion of Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re, he communicated them to no one,\r\nregarding as useless and cruel any reproachful words addressed to a man\r\nwho was so unfortunate as to have such a source of remorse in his life.\r\nHe even succeeded in convincing the colonel, who expressed in his\r\npresence some suspicions in that regard, that it was most urgent, in\r\nMadame Delmare\'s delicate condition, to continue to conceal from her the\r\npossible causes of her old playmate\'s suicide. So it was with the poor\r\ngirl\'s death as with her love affair. There was a tacit agreement never\r\nto mention it before Indiana, and ere long it ceased to be talked about\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nBut these precautions were of no avail, for Madame Delmare had her own\r\nreasons for suspecting a part of the truth; the bitter reproaches she\r\nhad heaped on the unhappy girl on that fatal evening seemed to her a\r\nsufficient explanation of her sudden resolution. So it was that, at the\r\nghastly moment when she discovered the dead body floating in the water,\r\nIndiana\'s repose, already so disturbed, and her heart, already so sad,\r\nhad received the final blow; her lingering disease was progressing\r\nactively; and this woman, young and perhaps strong, refusing to be\r\ncured, concealing her sufferings from her husband\'s undiscerning and far\r\nfrom delicate affection, sank voluntarily beneath the burden of sorrow\r\nand discouragement.\r\n\r\n"Woe is me!" she cried as she entered her room, after learning of\r\nRaymon\'s impending visit. "A curse on that man, who has entered this\r\nhouse only to bring despair and death! O God! why dost Thou permit him\r\nto come between Thee and me, to take command of my destiny at his\r\npleasure, so that he has only to put out his hand and say: \'She is mine!\r\nI will derange her reason, I will bring desolation into her life; and if\r\nshe resists me I will spread mourning around her, I will encompass her\r\nwith remorse, regrets and alarms!\' O God! it is not fair that a poor\r\nwoman should be so persecuted!"\r\n\r\nShe wept bitterly; for the thought of Raymon revived the memory of Noun,\r\nmore vivid and heartrending than ever.\r\n\r\n"Poor Noun! my poor playmate! my countrywoman, my only friend!" she\r\nexclaimed sorrowfully; "that man is your murderer. Unhappy child! his\r\ninfluence was fatal to you as to me! You loved me so dearly, you were\r\nthe only one who could divine my sorrows and mitigate them by your\r\nartless gayety! Woe to me who have lost you! Was it for this that I\r\nbrought you from so far away! By what wiles did that man surprise your\r\ngood faith and induce you to do such a despicable thing? Ah! he must\r\nhave deceived you shamefully, and you did not realize your error until\r\nyou saw my indignation! I was too harsh, Noun, I was so harsh that I was\r\ndownright cruel; I drove you to despair, I killed you! Poor girl! why\r\ndid you not wait a few hours until the wind had blown away my resentment\r\nlike a wisp of straw! Why did you not come and weep on my bosom and say:\r\n\'I was deceived; I acted without knowing what I was doing, but you know\r\nwell enough that I respect you and love you!\'--I would have taken you in\r\nmy arms, we would have wept together, and you would not be dead. Dead!\r\ndead so young and so lovely and so full of life! Dead at nineteen and\r\nsuch a ghastly death!"\r\n\r\nWhile thus weeping for her companion, Indiana, unknown to herself, wept\r\nalso for her three days of illusion, the loveliest days of her life, the\r\nonly days when she had really lived; for during those three days she had\r\nloved with a passion which Raymon, had he been the most presumptuous of\r\nmen, could never have imagined. But the blinder and more violent that\r\nlove had been, the more keenly had she felt the insult she had received;\r\nthe first love of a heart like hers contains so much modesty and\r\nsensitive delicacy!\r\n\r\nAnd yet Indiana had yielded to a burst of shame and anger rather than to\r\na well-matured determination. I have no doubt that Raymon would have\r\nobtained his pardon had he been allowed a few more minutes in which to\r\nplead for it. But fate had defeated his love and his address, and Madame\r\nDelmare honestly believed now that she hated him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor his part, it was neither in a spirit of bravado nor because of the\r\ninjury to his self-esteem that he aspired more ardently than ever to\r\nMadame Delmare\'s love and forgiveness. He believed that they were\r\nunattainable, and no other woman\'s love, no other earthly joy seemed to\r\nhim their equivalent. Such was his nature. An insatiable craving for\r\naction and excitement consumed his life. He loved society with its laws\r\nand its fetters, because it offered him material for combat and\r\nresistance; and if he had a horror of license and debauchery, it was\r\nbecause they promised insipid and easily obtained pleasure.\r\n\r\nDo not believe, however, that he was insensible to Noun\'s ruin. In the\r\nfirst impulse, he conceived a horror of himself and loaded his pistols\r\nwith a very real purpose of blowing out his brains; but a praiseworthy\r\nfeeling stayed his hand. What would become of his mother, his aged,\r\nfeeble mother, the poor woman whose life had been so agitated and so\r\nsorrowful, who lived only for him, her only treasure, her only hope?\r\nMust he break her heart, shorten the few years that still remained to\r\nher? No, surely not. The best way to redeem his wrongdoing was to devote\r\nhimself thenceforth solely to his mother, and it was with that purpose\r\nin mind that he returned to her at Paris, and put forth all his energies\r\nto make her forget his desertion of her during a large part of the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nRaymon exerted an incredible influence over everybody about him; for,\r\ntake him for all in all, with his faults and his youthful escapades, he\r\nwas above the average of society men. We have not as yet told you upon\r\nwhat his reputation for wit and talent was based, because it was aside\r\nfrom the events we had to describe; but it is time to inform you that\r\nthis Raymon, whose weaknesses you have followed and whose frivolity you\r\nhave censured, is one of the men who have had the most control and\r\ninfluence over your thoughts, whatever your opinions to-day may be. You\r\nhave devoured his political pamphlets, and, while reading the newspapers\r\nof the period, you have often been captivated by the irresistible charm\r\nof his style and the grace of his courteous and worldly logic.\r\n\r\nI am speaking of a time already far away, in these days when time is no\r\nlonger reckoned by centuries, nor even by reigns, but by ministries. I\r\nam speaking of the Martignac year, of that epoch of repose and doubt,\r\ninterjected in the middle of a political era, not like a treaty of\r\npeace, but like an armistice; of those fifteen months of the reign of\r\ndoctrines, which had such a strange influence on principles and on\r\nmorals, and which may perhaps have paved the way for the extraordinary\r\nresult of our latest revolution.\r\n\r\nIt was in those days that men saw the blooming of certain youthful\r\ntalents, unfortunate in that they were born in a period of transition\r\nand of compromise; for they paid their tribute to the conciliatory and\r\nwavering tendencies of the time. Never, so far as I know, was knowledge\r\nof mere words and ignorance, or pretended ignorance, of things carried\r\nso far. It was the reign of restrictions, and it is beyond my power to\r\nsay who made the fullest use of them, short-gowned Jesuits or\r\nlong-gowned lawyers. Political moderation had become a part of the\r\nnational character, like courteous manners, and it was the same with the\r\nfirst variety of courtesy as with the second: it served as a mask for\r\nsecret antipathies, and taught them how to fight without scandal and\r\npublicity. We must say, however, in defence of the young men of that\r\nperiod, that they were often towed like light skiffs in the wake of\r\ngreat ships, with no very clear idea of where they were being taken,\r\nproud and happy to be cleaving the waves and swelling out their new\r\nsails.\r\n\r\nPlaced by his birth and his wealth among the partisans of absolute\r\nroyalty, Raymon made a sacrifice to the _youthful_ ideas of his time by\r\nclinging religiously to the Charter; at all events that was what he\r\nthought that he was doing and what he exerted himself to prove. But\r\nconventions that have fallen into desuetude are subject to\r\ninterpretation, and the Charter of Louis XVIII was already in the same\r\nplight as the Gospel of Jesus Christ; it was simply a text upon which\r\neverybody practised his powers of eloquence, and a speech thereon\r\ncreated a precedent no more than a sermon. A period of luxurious living\r\nand indolence, when civilization lay sleeping on the brink of a\r\nbottomless abyss, eager to enjoy its last pleasures.\r\n\r\nRaymon had taken his stand upon the line between abuse of power and\r\nabuse of licence, a shifting ground upon which good men still sought,\r\nbut in vain, a shelter from the tempest that was brewing. To him, as to\r\nmany other experienced minds, the r\xc3\xb4le of conscientious statesman still\r\nseemed possible. A manifest error at a time when people pretended to\r\ndefer to the voice of reason only to stifle it the more surely on every\r\nside. Being without political passions, Raymon fancied that he was\r\nwithout interests to promote; but he was mistaken, for society,\r\nconstituted as it then was, was agreeable and advantageous to him; it\r\ncould not be disturbed without a diminution in the sum total of his\r\nwell-being, and that perfect contentment with one\'s social position,\r\nwhich communicates itself to the thought, is a wonderful promoter of\r\nmoderation. Who is so ungrateful to Providence as to reproach it for the\r\nmisfortunes of other people, if it has only smiles and benefactions for\r\nhim? How was it possible to persuade those young supporters of the\r\nconstitutional monarchy that the constitution was already antiquated,\r\nthat it weighed heavily on the social body and fatigued it, while they\r\nfound its burdens light and reaped only its advantages?\r\n\r\nNothing is so easy and so common as to deceive one\'s self when one does\r\nnot lack wit and is familiar with all the niceties of the language.\r\nLanguage is a prostitute queen who descends and rises to all r\xc3\xb4les,\r\ndisguises herself, arrays herself in fine apparel, hides her head and\r\neffaces herself; an advocate who has an answer for everything, who has\r\nalways foreseen everything, and who assumes a thousand forms in order to\r\nbe right. The most honorable of men is he who thinks best and acts best,\r\nbut the most powerful is he who is best able to talk and write.\r\n\r\nAs his wealth relieved him from the necessity of writing for money,\r\nRaymon wrote from a liking for it, and--he said it with perfect good\r\nfaith--from a sense of duty. The rare faculty that he possessed, of\r\nrefuting positive truth by sheer talent, had made him an invaluable man\r\nto the ministry, whom he served much better by his impartial criticism\r\nthan did its creatures by their blind devotion; and even more invaluable\r\nto that fashionable young society which was quite willing to abjure the\r\nabsurdities of its former privileges, but wished at the same time to\r\nretain the benefit of its present advantageous position.\r\n\r\nThey were in very truth men of great talent who still supported society,\r\ntottering on the brink of the precipice, and who, being themselves\r\nsuspended between two reefs, struggled calmly and with perfect\r\nself-possession against the harsh reality that was on the point of\r\nengulfing them. To succeed in such wise as to create a conviction\r\nagainst every sort of probability and to keep that conviction alive for\r\nsome time among men of no convictions, is the art which most impresses\r\nand surpasses the understanding of an uncultivated, vulgar mind which\r\nhas studied none but commonplace truths.\r\n\r\nThus Raymon had no sooner returned to that society, which was his\r\nelement and his home, than he felt its vital and exciting influences.\r\nThe petty love affairs that had engrossed him vanished for a moment in\r\nthe face of broader and more brilliant interests. He carried into these\r\nthe same boldness of attack, the same ardor; and when he saw that he was\r\nmore eagerly sought than ever by all the most distinguished people in\r\nParis, he felt that he loved life more than ever. Was he to be blamed\r\nfor forgetting a secret remorse while reaping the reward he had merited\r\nfor services rendered his country? He felt life overflowing through\r\nevery pore of his young heart, his active brain, his whole vigorous and\r\nbuoyant being, he felt that destiny was making him happy in spite of\r\nhimself; and he would crave forgiveness of an indignant ghost that came\r\nsometimes and bewailed her fate in his dreams, for having sought in the\r\naffection of the living a protection against the terrors of the grave.\r\n\r\nBut he had no sooner returned to life, as it were, than he felt, as in\r\nthe past, the need of mingling thoughts of love and plans of intrigue\r\nwith his political meditations, his dreams of ambition and philosophy. I\r\nsay ambition, not meaning ambition for honor and wealth, for which he\r\nhad no use, but for reputation and aristocratic popularity.\r\n\r\nHe had at first despaired of ever seeing Madame Delmare again after the\r\ntragic ending of his double intrigue. But, as he measured the extent of\r\nhis loss, as he brooded over the thought of the treasure that had\r\nescaped him, he conceived the hope of grasping it once more, and, at the\r\nsame time he regained determination and confidence. He calculated the\r\nobstacles he should encounter, and realized that the most difficult to\r\novercome at the outset would come from Indiana herself; therefore he\r\nmust use the husband to protect him from the attack. This was not a new\r\nidea, but it was sure; jealous husbands are particularly well adapted to\r\nthis service.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after he had conceived this idea, Raymon was on the way to\r\nLagny, where he was expected to breakfast. You will not require me to\r\ndescribe to you in detail the shrewdly proffered services by which he\r\nhad succeeded in making himself agreeable to Monsieur Delmare; I prefer,\r\nas I am describing the features of the characters in this tale, to draw\r\na hasty sketch of the colonel for you.\r\n\r\nDo you know what they call an _honest_ man in the provinces? He is a man\r\nwho does not encroach on his neighbor\'s field; who does not demand from\r\nhis debtors a sou more than they owe him; who raises his hat to every\r\nperson who bows to him; who does not ravish maidens in the public roads;\r\nwho sets fire to no other man\'s barn; who does not rob wayfarers at the\r\ncorner of his park. Provided that he religiously respects the lives and\r\npurses of his fellow-citizens, nothing more is demanded of him. He may\r\nbeat his wife, maltreat his servants, ruin his children, and it is\r\nnobody\'s business. Society punishes only those acts which are injurious\r\nto it; private life is beyond its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nSuch was Monsieur Delmare\'s theory of morals. He had never studied any\r\nother social contract than this: _Every man is master in his own house._\r\nHe treated all affairs of the heart as feminine puerilities, sentimental\r\nsubtleties. Being a man devoid of wit, of tact and of education, he\r\nenjoyed greater consideration than a man obtains by dint of talent and\r\namiability. He had broad shoulders and a strong wrist; he handled the\r\nsword and the sabre perfectly, and was exceedingly quick to take\r\noffence. As he did not always understand a joke, he was constantly\r\nhaunted by the idea that people were making fun of him. Being incapable\r\nof suitable repartee, he had but one way of defending himself: to\r\nenforce silence by threats. His favorite epigrams always turned upon\r\ncowhidings to be administered and affairs of honor to be settled;\r\nwherefore the province always prefixed to his name the epithet _brave_\r\nbecause military valor apparently consists in having broad shoulders and\r\nlong moustaches, in swearing fiercely, and in putting one\'s hand to the\r\nsword on the slightest pretext.\r\n\r\nGod forbid that I should believe that camp life makes all men brutes!\r\nbut I may be permitted to believe that one must have a large stock of\r\ntact and discretion to resist the habit of passive and brutal\r\ndomination. If you have served in the army, you are familiar with what\r\nthe troops call _skin-breeches_, and will agree that there are large\r\nnumbers of them among the remains of the old imperial cohorts. Those men\r\nwho, when brought together and urged forward by a powerful hand,\r\nperformed such magnificent exploits, towered like giants amid the smoke\r\nof the battle-field; but, having returned to civil life, the heroes\r\nbecame mere soldiers once more, bold, vulgar fellows who reasoned like\r\nmachines; and it was fortunate if they did not behave in society as in\r\nconquered territory. It was the fault of the age rather than theirs.\r\nIngenuous minds, they had faith in the adulation of victory, and allowed\r\nthemselves to be persuaded that they were great patriots because they\r\ndefended their country--some against their will, others for money and\r\nhonors. But how did they defend it, those tens of thousands of men who\r\nblindly embraced the error of a single man, and who, after saving their\r\ncountry, basely destroyed it? And again, if a soldier\'s devotion to his\r\ncaptain seems to you a great and noble thing, well and good, so it does\r\nto me; but I call that fidelity, not patriotism. I congratulate the\r\nconquerors of Spain, I do not thank them. As for the honor of the French\r\nname, I by no means understand that method of safeguarding it among\r\nneighbors, and I find it difficult to believe that the Emperor\'s\r\ngenerals were very deeply engrossed by it at that deplorable stage of\r\nour glory; but I know that we are forbidden to discuss these matters\r\nimpartially; I hold my peace, posterity will pass judgment on them.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Delmare had all the good qualities and all the failings of\r\nthese men. He was innocent to childishness concerning certain\r\nrefinements of the point of honor, yet he was very well able to conduct\r\nhis affairs to the best possible end without disturbing himself as to\r\nthe good or evil which might result therefrom to others. His whole\r\nconscience was the law; his whole moral code was his rights under the\r\nlaw. His was one of those rigid, unbending probities which never borrow\r\nfor fear of not returning, and never lend for fear of not recovering. He\r\nwas the honest man who neither takes nor gives aught; who would rather\r\ndie than steal a bundle of sticks in the king\'s forest, but would kill\r\nyou without ceremony for picking up a twig in his. He was useful to\r\nhimself alone, harmful to nobody. He took part in nothing that was going\r\non about him, lest he might be compelled to do somebody a favor. But,\r\nwhen he deemed himself in honor bound to do it, no one could go about it\r\nwith more energy and zeal and a more chivalrous spirit. At once trustful\r\nas a child and suspicious as a despot, he would believe a false oath and\r\ndistrust a sincere promise. As in the military profession, form was\r\neverything with him. Public opinion governed him so exclusively that\r\ncommon sense and argument counted for nothing in his decisions, and when\r\nhe said: "Such things are done," he thought that he had stated an\r\nirrefutable argument.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that his nature was most antipathetic to his\r\nwife\'s, his heart entirely unfitted to understand her, his mind entirely\r\nincapable of appreciating her. And yet it is certain that slavery had\r\nengendered in her woman\'s heart a sort of virtuous and unspoken aversion\r\nwhich was not always just. Madame Delmare doubted her husband\'s heart\r\novermuch; he was only harsh and she deemed him cruel. There was more\r\nroughness than anger in his outbreaks, more vulgarity than impertinence\r\nin his manners. Nature had not made him evil-minded: he had moments of\r\ncompassion which led him to repentance, and in his repentance he was\r\nalmost sensitive. It was camp life that had raised brutality to a\r\nprinciple in him. With a less refined, less gentle wife he would have\r\nbeen as gentle as a tame wolf; but this woman was disheartened with her\r\nfate; she did not take the trouble to try to make it happier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs he alighted from his tilbury in the courtyard at Lagny, Raymon\'s\r\nheart failed him. So he was once more to enter that house which recalled\r\nsuch awful memories! His arguments, being in accord with his passions,\r\nmight enable him to overcome the impulses of his heart, but not to\r\nstifle them, and at that moment the sensation of remorse was as keen as\r\nthat of desire.\r\n\r\nThe first person who came forward to meet him was Sir Ralph Brown, and\r\nwhen he spied him in his everlasting hunting costume, flanked by his\r\nhounds and sober as a Scotch laird, he fancied that the portrait he had\r\nseen in Madame Delmare\'s chamber was walking before his eyes. A few\r\nmoments later the colonel appeared, and the breakfast was served without\r\nIndiana. As he passed through the vestibule, by the door of the billiard\r\nroom, and recognized the places he had previously seen under such\r\ndifferent circumstances, Raymon was so distressed that he could hardly\r\nremember why he had come there now.\r\n\r\n"Is Madame Delmare really not coming down?" the colonel asked his\r\nfactotum Leli\xc3\xa8vre, with some asperity.\r\n\r\n"Madame slept badly," replied Leli\xc3\xa8vre, "and Mademoiselle Noun--that\r\ndevil of a name keeps coming to my tongue!--Mademoiselle Fanny, I mean,\r\njust told me that madame is lying down now."\r\n\r\n"How does it happen then that I just saw her at her window? Fanny is\r\nmistaken. Go and tell madame that breakfast is served; or stay--Sir\r\nRalph, my dear kinsman, be pleased to go up and see for yourself if your\r\ncousin is really ill."\r\n\r\nWhile the unfortunate name that the servant had mentioned from habit\r\ncaused Raymon\'s nerves a painful thrill, the colonel\'s expedient caused\r\nhim a strange sensation of jealous anger.\r\n\r\n"In her bedroom!" he thought. "He doesn\'t confine himself to hanging the\r\nman\'s portrait there, but sends him there in person. This Englishman has\r\nprivileges here which the husband himself seems to be afraid to claim."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t let that surprise you," said Monsieur Delmare, as if he had\r\ndivined Raymon\'s reflections; "Monsieur Brown is the family physician;\r\nand then he\'s our cousin too, a fine fellow whom we love with all our\r\nhearts."\r\n\r\nRalph remained absent ten minutes. Raymon was distraught, ill at ease.\r\nHe did not eat and kept looking at the door. At last the Englishman\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\n"Indiana is really ill," he said; "I told her to go back to bed."\r\n\r\nHe took his seat tranquilly and ate with a robust appetite. The colonel\r\ndid likewise.\r\n\r\n"This is evidently a pretext to avoid seeing me," thought Raymon. "These\r\ntwo men don\'t suspect it, and the husband is more displeased than\r\nworried about his wife\'s condition. Good! my affairs are progressing\r\nmore favorably than I hoped."\r\n\r\nThis resistance rearoused his determination and Noun\'s image vanished\r\nfrom the dismal hangings, which, at the beginning, had congealed his\r\nblood with terror. Soon he saw nothing but Madame Delmare\'s slender\r\nform. In the salon he sat at her embroidery frame, examined the flowers\r\nshe was making--talking all the while and feigning deep\r\ninterest--handled all the silks, inhaled the perfume her tiny fingers\r\nhad left upon them. He had seen the same piece of work before, in\r\nIndiana\'s bedroom; then it was hardly begun, now it was covered with\r\nflowers that had bloomed beneath the breath of fever, watered by her\r\ndaily tears. Raymon felt the tears coming to his own eyes, and, by\r\nvirtue of some unexplained sympathy, sadly raising his eyes to the\r\nhorizon, at which Indiana was in the habit of gazing in melancholy mood,\r\nhe saw in the distance the white walls of Cercy standing out against a\r\nbackground of dark hills.\r\n\r\nThe colonel\'s voice roused him with a start.\r\n\r\n"Well, my excellent neighbor," he said, "it is time for me to pay my\r\ndebt to you and keep my promises. The factory is in full swing and the\r\nhands are all at work. Here are paper and pencils, so that you can take\r\nnotes."\r\n\r\nRaymon followed the colonel, inspected the factory with an eager,\r\ninterested air, made comments which proved that chemistry and mechanics\r\nwere equally familiar to him, listened with incredible patience to\r\nMonsieur Delmare\'s endless dissertations, coincided with some of his\r\nideas, combated some others, and in every respect so conducted himself\r\nas to persuade his guide that he took an absorbing interest in these\r\nthings, whereas he was hardly thinking of them and all his thoughts were\r\ndirected toward Madame Delmare.\r\n\r\nIt was a fact that he was familiar with every branch of knowledge, that\r\nno invention was without interest for him; moreover he was forwarding\r\nthe interests of his brother, who had really embarked his whole fortune\r\nin a similar enterprise, although of much greater extent. Monsieur\r\nDelmare\'s technical knowledge, his only claim to superiority, pointed\r\nout to him at that moment the best method of taking advantage of this\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph, who was a poor business man but a very shrewd politician,\r\nsuggested during the inspection of the factory some economical\r\nconsiderations of considerable importance. The workmen, being anxious to\r\ndisplay their skill to an expert, surpassed themselves in deftness and\r\nactivity. Raymon looked at everything, heard everything, answered\r\neverything, and thought of nothing but the love affair that brought him\r\nto that place.\r\n\r\nWhen they had exhausted the subject of machinery the discussion fell\r\nupon the volume and force of the stream. They went out and climbed upon\r\nthe dam, bidding the overseer raise the gates and mark the different\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," said the man, addressing Monsieur Delmare, who fixed the\r\nmaximum at fifteen feet, "I beg pardon, but we had it seventeen once\r\nthis year."\r\n\r\n"When was that? You are mistaken," said the colonel.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, monsieur, it was on the eve of your return from Belgium, the\r\nvery night Mademoiselle Noun was found drowned; what I say is proved by\r\nthe fact that the body passed over that dike yonder and did not stop\r\nuntil it got here, just where monsieur is standing."\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus, with much animation, the man pointed to where Raymon\r\nstood. The unhappy young man turned pale as death; he cast a horrified\r\nglance at the water flowing at his feet; it seemed to him that the livid\r\nface was reflected in it, that the body was still floating there; he had\r\nan attack of vertigo and would have fallen into the river had not\r\nMonsieur Brown caught his arm and pulled him away.\r\n\r\n"Very good," said the colonel, who noticed nothing, and who gave so\r\nlittle thought to Noun that he did not suspect Raymon\'s emotion; "but\r\nthat was an extraordinary instance, and the average depth of the water\r\nis--But what the devil\'s the matter with you two?" he inquired, suddenly\r\ninterrupting himself.\r\n\r\n"Nothing," replied Sir Ralph; "as I turned I trod on monsieur\'s foot; I\r\nam distressed, for I must have hurt him terribly."\r\n\r\nSir Ralph made this reply in so calm and natural a tone that Raymon was\r\nconvinced that he thought he was telling the truth. A few courteous\r\nwords were exchanged and the conversation resumed its course.\r\n\r\nRaymon left Lagny a few hours later without seeing Madame Delmare. It\r\nwas better than he hoped; he had feared that he should find her calm and\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\nHowever he repeated his visit with no better success. That time the\r\ncolonel was alone; Raymon put forth all the resources of his wit to\r\ncaptivate him, and shrewdly descended to innumerable little acts of\r\ncondescension--praised Napol\xc3\xa9on, whom he did not like, deplored the\r\nindifference of the government, which left the illustrious remnant of\r\nthe Grande Arm\xc3\xa9e in oblivion and something like contempt, carried\r\nopposition tenets as far as his opinions would permit him to go, and\r\nselected from his various beliefs those which were likely to flatter\r\nMonsieur Delmare\'s. He even provided himself with a character different\r\nfrom his real one, in order to attract his confidence. He transformed\r\nhimself into a _bon vivant_, a "hail fellow well met," a careless\r\ngood-for-naught.\r\n\r\n"What if that fellow should ever make a conquest of my wife!" said the\r\ncolonel to himself as he watched him drive away.\r\n\r\nThen he began to chuckle inwardly and to think that Raymon was a\r\n_charming fellow._\r\n\r\nMadame de Rami\xc3\xa8re was at Cercy at this time: Raymon extolled Madame\r\nDelmare\'s charms and wit to her, and without urging her to call upon\r\nher, had the art to suggest the thought.\r\n\r\n"I believe she is the only one of my neighbors whom I do not know," she\r\nsaid; "and as I am a new arrival in the neighborhood it is my place to\r\nbegin. We will go to Lagny together next week."\r\n\r\nThe appointed day arrived.\r\n\r\n"She cannot avoid me now," thought Raymon.\r\n\r\nIn truth Madame Delmare could not escape the necessity of receiving him,\r\nfor when she saw an elderly woman she did not know step from the\r\ncarriage, she went out on the stoop herself to meet her. At the same\r\nmoment she recognized Raymon in the man who accompanied her; but she\r\nrealized that he must have deceived his mother to induce her to take\r\nthat step, and her displeasure on that account gave her strength to be\r\ndignified and calm. She received Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re with a mixture of\r\nrespect and affability; but her coldness to Raymon was so absolutely\r\nglacial that he felt that he could not long endure it. He was not\r\naccustomed to disdain and his pride took fire at being unable to conquer\r\nwith a glance those who were prepossessed against him. Thereupon,\r\ndeciding upon his course like a man who cared nothing for a woman\'s\r\nwhim, he asked permission to join Monsieur Delmare in the park and left\r\nthe two women together.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, vanquished by the charm which a superior intellect,\r\ncombined with a noble and generous heart, is capable of exerting even in\r\nits least intimate relations, Indiana became affable, affectionate and\r\nalmost playful with Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re. She had never known her mother,\r\nand Madame de Carvajal, despite her presents and her words of praise,\r\nwas far from being a mother to her; so she felt a sort of fascination of\r\nthe heart with Raymon\'s mother.\r\n\r\nWhen he joined her as she was stepping into her carriage he saw Indiana\r\nput to her lips the hand that Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re offered her. Poor\r\nIndiana felt the need of having some one to cling to. Everything that\r\noffered a prospect of interest and of companionship in her lonely and\r\nunhappy life was welcomed by her with the keenest delight; and then she\r\nsaid to herself that Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re would preserve her from the\r\nsnare into which Raymon sought to lure her.\r\n\r\n"I will throw myself into this good woman\'s arms," she was thinking\r\nalready, "and, if necessary, I will tell her everything. I will implore\r\nher to save me from her son, and her prudence will stand guard over him\r\nand over me."\r\n\r\nSuch was not Raymon\'s reasoning.\r\n\r\n"Dear mother!" he said to himself, as he drove back with her to Cercy,\r\n"her charm and her goodness of heart perform miracles. What do I not owe\r\nto them already! my education, my success in life, my standing in\r\nsociety. I lacked nothing but the happiness of owing to her the heart of\r\nsuch a woman as Indiana."\r\n\r\nRaymon, as we see, loved his mother because of his need of her and of\r\nthe well-being he owed to her; so do all children love their mothers.\r\n\r\nA few days later Raymon received an invitation to pass three days at\r\nBellerive, a beautiful country seat owned by Sir Ralph Brown, between\r\nCercy and Lagny, where it was proposed, in concert with the best hunters\r\nof the neighborhood, to destroy a part of the game that was devouring\r\nthe owner\'s woods and gardens. Raymon liked neither Sir Ralph nor\r\nhunting, but Madame Delmare did the honors of her cousin\'s house on\r\ngreat occasions, and the hope of meeting her soon decided Raymon to\r\naccept the invitation.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Sir Ralph did not expect Madame Delmare on this\r\noccasion; she had excused herself on the ground of her wretched health.\r\nBut the colonel, who took umbrage when his wife sought diversion on her\r\nown account, took still greater umbrage when she declined such\r\ndiversions as he chose to allow her.\r\n\r\n"Do you want to make the whole province think that I keep you under lock\r\nand key?" he said to her. "You make me appear like a jealous husband;\r\nit\'s an absurd r\xc3\xb4le and one that I do not propose to play any longer.\r\nBesides, what does this lack of courtesy to your cousin mean? Does it\r\nbecome you, when we owe to his friendship the establishment and\r\nprosperity of our business, to refuse him such a service? You are\r\nnecessary to him and you hesitate! I cannot understand your whims. All\r\nthe people whom I don\'t like are sure of a hearty welcome from you; but\r\nthose whom I esteem are unfortunate enough not to please you."\r\n\r\n"That reproach has very little application to the present case, I should\r\nsay," replied Madame Delmare. "I love my cousin like a brother, and my\r\naffection for him was of long standing when yours began."\r\n\r\n"Oh! yes, yes, more of your fine words; but I know that you don\'t find\r\nhim sentimental enough, the poor devil! you call him selfish because he\r\ndoesn\'t like novels and doesn\'t cry over the death of a dog. However,\r\nhe\'s not the only one. How did you receive Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re? a\r\ncharming young fellow, on my word! Madame de Carvajal introduces him to\r\nyou and you receive him with the greatest affability; but I have the\r\nill-luck to think well of him and you pronounce him unendurable, and\r\nwhen he calls upon you, you go to bed! Are you trying to make me appear\r\na perfect boor? It is time for this to come to an end and for you to\r\nbegin to live like other people."\r\n\r\nRaymon deemed it inadvisable, in view of his plans, to show too much\r\neagerness; threats of indifference are successful with almost all women\r\nwho think that they are loved. But the hunting had been in progress\r\nsince morning when he reached Sir Ralph\'s, and Madame Delmare was not\r\nexpected until dinner time. He employed the interval in preparing a plan\r\nof action.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him that he must find some method of justifying his\r\nconduct, for the critical moment was at hand. He had two days before him\r\nand he determined to apportion the time thus: the rest of the day that\r\nwas nearly ended to make an impression, the next day to persuade and the\r\nfollowing day to be happy. He even consulted his watch and calculated\r\nalmost to an hour the time when his enterprise would succeed or fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had been two hours in the salon when he heard Madame Delmare\'s sweet\r\nand slightly husky voice in the adjoining room. By dint of reflecting on\r\nhis scheme of seduction he had become as passionately interested as an\r\nauthor in his subject or a lawyer in his cause, and the emotion that he\r\nfelt at the sight of Indiana may be compared to that of an actor\r\nthoroughly imbued with the spirit of his r\xc3\xb4le who finds himself in the\r\npresence of the principal character of the drama and can no longer\r\ndistinguish artificial stage effects from reality.\r\n\r\nShe was so changed that a feeling of sincere compassion found its way\r\ninto Raymon\'s being, amid the nervous tremors of his brain. Unhappiness\r\nand illness had left such deep traces on her face that she was hardly\r\npretty, and that he felt that there was more glory than pleasure to be\r\ngained by the conquest. But he owed it to himself to restore this woman\r\nto life and happiness.\r\n\r\nSeeing how pale and sad she was, he judged that he had no very strong\r\nwill to contend against. Was it possible that such a frail envelope\r\ncould conceal great power of moral resistance?\r\n\r\nHe reflected that it was necessary first of all to interest her in\r\nherself, to frighten her concerning her depression and her failing\r\nhealth, in order the more easily to open her mind to the desire and the\r\nhope of a better destiny.\r\n\r\n"Indiana!" he began, with secret assurance perfectly concealed beneath\r\nan air of profound melancholy, "to think that I should find you in such\r\na condition as this! I did not dream that this moment to which I have\r\nlooked forward so long, which I have sought so eagerly, would cause me\r\nsuch horrible pain!"\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare hardly anticipated this language; she expected to\r\nsurprise Raymon in the attitude of a confused and shrinking culprit; and\r\nlo! instead of accusing himself--of telling her of his grief and\r\nrepentance--his sorrow and pity were all for her! She must be sorely\r\ncast down and broken in spirit to inspire compassion in a man who should\r\nhave implored hers!\r\n\r\nA French woman--a woman of the world--would not have lost her head at\r\nsuch a delicate juncture; but Indiana had no tact; possessed neither the\r\nskill nor the power of dissimulation necessary to preserve the advantage\r\nof her position. His words brought before her eyes the whole picture of\r\nher sufferings and tears glistened on the edge of her eyelids.\r\n\r\n"I am ill, in truth," she said, as she seated herself, feebly and\r\nwearily, in the chair Raymon offered her; "I feel that I am very ill,\r\nand, in your presence, monsieur, I have the right to complain."\r\n\r\nRaymon had not hoped to progress so fast. He seized the opportunity by\r\nthe hair, as the saying is, and, taking possession of a hand which felt\r\ncold and dry in his, he replied:\r\n\r\n"Indiana! do not say that; do not say that I am the cause of your\r\nillness, for you make me mad with grief and joy."\r\n\r\n"And joy!" she repeated, fixing upon him her great blue eyes overflowing\r\nwith melancholy and amazement.\r\n\r\n"I should have said hope; for, if I have caused you unhappiness, madame,\r\nI can perhaps bring it to an end. Say a word," he added, kneeling beside\r\nher on a cushion that had fallen from the divan, "ask me for my blood,\r\nmy life!"\r\n\r\n"Oh! hush!" said Indiana bitterly, withdrawing her hand; "you made a\r\nshameful misuse of promises before; try to repair the evil you have\r\ndone!"\r\n\r\n"I intend to do it; I will do it!" he cried, trying to take her hand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n"It is too late," she said. "Give me back my companion, my sister; give\r\nme back Noun, my only friend!"\r\n\r\nA cold shiver ran through Raymon\'s veins. This time he had no need to\r\nencourage her emotion; there are emotions which awake unbidden, mighty\r\nand terrible, without the aid of art.\r\n\r\n"She knows all," he thought, "and she has judged me."\r\n\r\nNothing could be more humiliating to him than to be reproached for his\r\ncrime by the woman who had been his innocent accomplice; nothing more\r\nbitter than to see Noun\'s rival lamenting her death.\r\n\r\n"Yes, monsieur," said Indiana, raising her face, down which the tears\r\nwere streaming, "you were the cause--"\r\n\r\nBut she paused when she observed Raymon\'s pallor. It must have been most\r\nalarming, for he had never suffered so keenly.\r\n\r\nThereupon all the kindness of her heart and all the involuntary emotion\r\nwhich he aroused in her resumed their sway over Madame Delmare.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me!" she said in dismay; "I hurt you terribly; I have suffered\r\nso myself! Sit down and let us talk of something else."\r\n\r\nThis sudden manifestation of her sweet and generous nature rendered\r\nRaymon\'s emotion deeper than ever. He sobbed aloud; he put Indiana\'s\r\nhand to his lips and covered it with tears and kisses. It was the first\r\ntime that he had been able to weep since Noun\'s death, and it was\r\nIndiana who relieved his breast of that terrible weight.\r\n\r\n"Oh! since you, who never knew her, weep for her so freely," she said;\r\n"since you regret so bitterly the injury you have done me, I dare not\r\nreproach you any more. Let us weep for her together, monsieur, so that,\r\nfrom her place in heaven, she may see us and forgive us."\r\n\r\nRaymon\'s forehead was wet with cold perspiration. If the words _you who\r\nnever knew her_ had delivered him from painful anxiety, this appeal to\r\nhis victim\'s memory, in Indiana\'s innocent mouth, terrified him with a\r\nsuperstitious terror. Sorely distressed, he rose and walked feverishly\r\nto a window and leaned on the sill to breathe the fresh air. Indiana\r\nremained in her chair, silent and deeply moved. She felt a sort of\r\nsecret joy on seeing Raymon weep like a child and display the weakness\r\nof a woman.\r\n\r\n"He is naturally kind," she murmured to herself; "he is fond of me; his\r\nheart is warm and generous. He did wrong, but his repentance expiates\r\nhis fault, and I ought to have forgiven him sooner."\r\n\r\nShe gazed at him with a softened expression; her confidence in him had\r\nreturned. She mistook the remorse of the guilty man for the repentance\r\nof love.\r\n\r\n"Do not weep any more," she said, rising and walking up to him; "it was\r\nI who killed her; I alone am guilty. This remorse will sadden my whole\r\nlife. I gave way to an impulse of suspicion and anger; I humiliated her,\r\nwounded her to the heart. I vented upon her all my spleen against you;\r\nit was you alone who had offended me, and I punished my poor friend for\r\nit. I was very hard to her!"\r\n\r\n"And to me," said Raymon, suddenly forgetting the past to think only of\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare blushed.\r\n\r\n"I should not perhaps have reproached you for the cruel loss I sustained\r\non that awful night," she said; "but I cannot forget the imprudence of\r\nyour conduct toward me. The lack of delicacy in your romantic and\r\nculpable project wounded me very deeply. I believed then that you loved\r\nme!--and you did not even respect me!"\r\n\r\nRaymon recovered his strength, his determination, his love, his hopes;\r\nthe sinister presentiment, which had made his blood run cold, vanished\r\nlike a nightmare. He awoke once more, young, ardent, overflowing with\r\ndesire, with passion, and with hopes for the future.\r\n\r\n"I am guilty if you hate me," he said, vehemently, throwing himself at\r\nher feet; "but, if you love me, I am not guilty--I never have been. Tell\r\nme, Indiana, do you love me?"\r\n\r\n"Do you deserve it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"If, in order to deserve it," said Raymon, "I must love you to\r\nadoration--"\r\n\r\n"Listen to me," she said, abandoning her hands to him and fastening upon\r\nhim her great eyes, swimming in tears, wherein a sombre flame gleamed at\r\nintervals. "Do you know what it is to love a woman like me? No, you do\r\nnot know. You thought that it was merely a matter of gratifying the\r\ncaprice of a day. You judged my heart by all the surfeited hearts over\r\nwhich you have hitherto exerted your ephemeral domination. You do not\r\nknow that I have never loved as yet and that I will not give my\r\nuntouched virgin heart in exchange for a ruined, withered heart, my\r\nenthusiastic love for a lukewarm love, my whole life for one brief day!"\r\n\r\n"Madame, I love you passionately; my heart too is young and ardent, and,\r\nif it is not worthy of yours, no man\'s heart will ever be. I know how\r\nyou must be loved; I have not waited until this day to find out. Do I\r\nnot know your life? did I not describe it to you at the ball, the first\r\ntime that I ever had the privilege of speaking to you? Did I not read\r\nthe whole history of your heart in the first one of your glances that\r\never fell upon me? And with what did I fall in love, think you? with\r\nyour beauty alone? Ah! that is surely enough to drive an older and less\r\npassionate man to frenzy; but for my part, if I adore that gracious and\r\ncharming envelope, it is because it encloses a pure and divine soul, it\r\nis because a celestial fire quickens it, and because I see in you not a\r\nwoman simply, but an angel."\r\n\r\n"I know that you possess the art of praising; but do not hope to move my\r\nvanity. I have no need of homage, but of affection. I must be loved\r\nwithout a rival, without reserve and forever; you must be ready to\r\nsacrifice everything to me, fortune, reputation, duty, business,\r\nprinciples, family--everything, monsieur, because I shall place the same\r\nabsolute devotion in my scale, and I wish them to balance. You see that\r\nyou cannot love me like that!"\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Raymon had seen a woman take love\r\nseriously, although such cases are rare, luckily for society; but he\r\nknew that promises of love do not bind the honor, again luckily for\r\nsociety. Sometimes too the women who had demanded from him these solemn\r\npledges had been the first to break them. He did not take fright\r\ntherefore at Madame Delmare\'s demands, or rather he gave no thought\r\neither to the past or the future. He was borne along by the irresistible\r\nfascination of that frail, passionate woman, so weak in body, so\r\nresolute in heart and mind. She was so beautiful, so animated, so\r\nimposing as she dictated her laws to him, that he remained as if\r\nfascinated at her knees.\r\n\r\n"I swear," he said, "that I will be yours body and soul; I devote my\r\nlife, I consecrate my blood to you, I place my will at your service;\r\ntake everything, do as you will with my fortune, my honor, my\r\nconscience, my thoughts, my whole being."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Indiana hastily, "here is my cousin."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke the phlegmatic Sir Ralph Brown entered the room with his\r\nusual tranquil air, expressing great surprise and pleasure to see his\r\ncousin, whom he had not hoped to see. Then he asked permission to kiss\r\nher by way of manifesting his gratitude, and, leaning over her with\r\nmethodical moderation, he kissed her on the lips, according to the\r\ncustom among children in his country.\r\n\r\nRaymon turned pale with anger and Ralph had no sooner left the room to\r\ngive some order, than he went to Indiana and tried to remove all trace\r\nof that impertinent kiss. But Madame Delmare calmly pushed him away.\r\n\r\n"Remember," she said, "that you owe much reparation if you wish me to\r\nbelieve in you."\r\n\r\nRaymon did not understand the delicacy of this rebuff; he saw in it\r\nnothing but a rebuff and he was angry with Sir Ralph. Shortly after he\r\nnoticed that, when Sir Ralph spoke to Indiana in an undertone, he used\r\nthe more familiar form of address, and he was on the verge of mistaking\r\nthe reserve which custom imposed upon Sir Ralph at other times, for the\r\nprecaution of a favored lover. But he blushed for his insulting\r\nsuspicions as soon as he met the young woman\'s pure glance.\r\n\r\nThat evening Raymon displayed his intellectual powers. There was a large\r\ncompany and people listened to him; he could not escape the prominence\r\nwhich his talents gave him. He talked, and if Indiana had been vain she\r\nwould have had her first taste of happiness in listening to him. But on\r\nthe contrary her simple, straightforward mind took fright at Raymon\'s\r\nsuperiority; she struggled against the magic power which he exerted over\r\nall about him, a sort of magnetic influence which heaven, or hell,\r\naccords to certain men--a partial and ephemeral royalty, so real that no\r\nmediocre mind can escape its ascendancy, so fleeting that no trace of it\r\nremains after them, and that when they die we are amazed at the\r\nsensation they made during their lives.\r\n\r\nThere were many times when Indiana was fascinated by such a brilliant\r\ndisplay; but she at once said to herself sadly that she was eager for\r\nhappiness, not for glory. She asked herself in dismay if this man, for\r\nwhom life had so many different aspects, so many absorbing interests,\r\ncould devote his whole mind to her, sacrifice all his ambitions to her.\r\nAnd while he defended step by step, with such courage and skill, such\r\nardor and self-possession, doctrines purely speculative and interests\r\nentirely foreign to their love, she was terrified to see that she was of\r\nso little account in his life while he was everything in hers. She said\r\nto herself in terror that she was to him a three days\' fancy and that he\r\nhad been to her the dream of a whole life.\r\n\r\nWhen he offered her his arm as they were leaving the salon, he whispered\r\na few words of love in her ear; but she answered sadly:\r\n\r\n"You have a great mind!"\r\n\r\nRaymon understood the reproof and passed the whole of the following day\r\nat Madame Delmare\'s feet. The other guests, being engrossed by their\r\nhunting, left them entirely to themselves.\r\n\r\nRaymon was eloquent; Indiana had such a craving to believe, that half of\r\nhis eloquence was wasted. Women of France, you do not know what a creole\r\nis; you would undoubtedly have yielded less readily to conviction, for\r\nyou are not the ones to be deceived or betrayed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Ralph returned from hunting and as usual felt Madame Delmare\'s\r\npulse, Raymon, who was watching him closely, detected an almost\r\nimperceptible expression of surprise and pleasure on his placid\r\nfeatures. And then, in obedience to some mysterious secret impulse, the\r\ntwo men looked at each other, and Sir Ralph\'s light eyes, fastened like\r\nan owl\'s upon Raymon\'s black ones, forced them to look down. During the\r\nrest of the day the baronet\'s manner toward Madame Delmare, beneath his\r\napparent imperturbability, was keenly observant, indicative of something\r\nwhich might be called interest or solicitude if his face had been\r\ncapable of reflecting a decided sentiment. But Raymon exerted himself in\r\nvain to discover if fear or hope were uppermost in his thoughts; Ralph\r\nwas impenetrable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as he stood a few steps behind Madame Delmare\'s chair, he\r\nheard her cousin say to her in an undertone:\r\n\r\n"You would do well, cousin, to go out in the saddle to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Why, I have no horse just now, as you know," she said.\r\n\r\n"We will find one for you. Will you hunt with us?"\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare resorted to various pretexts to escape. Raymon understood\r\nthat she preferred to remain with him, but he thought at the same time\r\nthat her cousin seemed to display extraordinary persistence in\r\npreventing her from doing so. So he left the persons with whom he was\r\ntalking, walked up to her and joined Sir Ralph in urging her to go. He\r\nhad a feeling of bitter resentment against this importunate chaperon,\r\nand determined to tire out his watchfulness.\r\n\r\n"If you will agree to follow the hunt," he said to Indiana, "you will\r\nembolden me to follow your example, madame. I care little for hunting;\r\nbut to have the privilege of being your esquire----"\r\n\r\n"In that case I will go," replied Indiana, heedlessly.\r\n\r\nShe exchanged a meaning glance with Raymon; but, swift as it was, Sir\r\nRalph caught it on the wing, and Raymon was unable, during the rest of\r\nthe evening, to glance at her or address her without encountering\r\nMonsieur Brown\'s eyes or ears. A feeling of aversion, almost of\r\njealousy, arose in his heart. By what right did this cousin, this friend\r\nof the family, assume to act as a school-master with the woman whom he\r\nloved! He swore that Sir Ralph should repent, and he sought an\r\nopportunity to insult him without compromising Madame Delmare; but that\r\nwas impossible. Sir Ralph did the honors of his establishment with a\r\ncold and dignified courtesy which offered no handle for an epigram or a\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before the rising-bell had rung, Raymon was surprised\r\nto see his host\'s solemn face enter his room. There was something even\r\nstiffer than usual in his manner, and Raymon felt his heart beat fast\r\nwith longing and impatience at the prospect of a challenge. But he came\r\nsimply to talk about a horse which Raymon had brought to Bellerive and\r\nhad expressed a desire to sell. The bargain was concluded in five\r\nminutes; Sir Ralph made no objection to the price but produced a\r\n_rouleau_ of gold from his pocket and counted down the amount on the\r\nmantel with a coolness of manner that was altogether extraordinary, not\r\ndeigning to pay any heed to Raymon\'s remonstrances concerning such\r\nscrupulous promptness. As he was leaving the room, he turned back to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n"Monsieur, the horse belongs to me from this morning!"\r\n\r\nAt that Raymon fancied that he could detect a purpose to prevent him\r\nfrom hunting, and he observed dryly that he did not propose to follow\r\nthe hunt on foot.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," replied Sir Ralph, with a slight trace of affectation, "I am\r\ntoo well versed in the laws of hospitality."\r\n\r\nAnd he withdrew.\r\n\r\nOn going down into the courtyard Raymon saw Madame Delmare in her\r\nriding-habit, playing merrily with Ophelia, who was tearing her\r\nhandkerchief. Her cheeks had taken on a faint rosy tinge, her eyes shone\r\nwith a brilliancy that had long been absent from them. She had already\r\nrecovered her beauty; her curly black hair escaped from beneath her\r\nlittle hat, in which she was charming; and the cloth habit buttoned to\r\nthe chin outlined her slender, graceful figure. The principal charm of\r\nthe creoles, to my mind, consists in the fact that the excessive\r\ndelicacy of their features and their proportions enables them to retain\r\nfor a long while the daintiness of childhood. Indiana, in her gay and\r\nlaughing mood, seemed to be no more than fourteen.\r\n\r\nRaymon, impressed by her charms, felt a thrill of triumph and paid her\r\nthe least insipid compliment he could invent upon her beauty.\r\n\r\n"You were anxious about my health," she said to him in an undertone; "do\r\nyou not see that I long to live?" He could not reply otherwise than by a\r\nhappy, grateful glance. Sir Ralph himself brought his cousin her horse;\r\nRaymon recognized the one he had just sold.\r\n\r\n"What!" said Madame Delmare in amazement, for she had seen him trying\r\nthe animal the day before in the courtyard, "is Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re so\r\npolite as to lend me his horse?"\r\n\r\n"Did you not admire the creature\'s beauty and docility yesterday?" said\r\nSir Ralph; "he is yours from this moment. I am sorry, my dear, that I\r\ncouldn\'t have given him to you sooner."\r\n\r\n"You are growing facetious, cousin," said Madame Delmare; "I do not\r\nunderstand this joke at all. Whom am I to thank--Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re,\r\nwho consents to lend me his horse, or you, who perhaps asked him for\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"You must thank your cousin," said Monsieur Delmare, "who bought this\r\nhorse for you and makes you a present of him."\r\n\r\n"Is it really true, my dear Ralph?" said Madame Delmare, patting the\r\npretty creature with the delight of a girl at receiving her first\r\njewels.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t we agree that I should give you a horse in exchange for the\r\npiece of embroidery you are doing for me? Come, mount him, have no fear.\r\nI have studied his disposition, and I tried him only this morning."\r\n\r\nIndiana threw her arms around Sir Ralph\'s neck, then leaped upon\r\nRaymon\'s horse and fearlessly made him prance.\r\n\r\nThis whole domestic scene took place in a corner of the courtyard before\r\nRaymon\'s eyes. He was conscious of a paroxysm of violent anger when the\r\nsimple and trustful affection of those two displayed itself before him;\r\npassionately in love as he was and with less than a whole day in which\r\nto have Indiana to himself.\r\n\r\n"How happy I am!" she said, calling him to her side on the avenue. "It\r\nseems my dear Ralph divined what gift would be most precious to me. And\r\naren\'t you happy too, Raymon, to see the horse you have ridden pass into\r\nmy hands? Oh! how I will love him and care for him! What do you call\r\nhim? Tell me; for I prefer not to take away the name you gave him."\r\n\r\n"If there is a happy man here," rejoined Raymon, "it should be your\r\ncousin, who gives you presents and whom you kiss so heartily."\r\n\r\n"Are you really jealous of our friendship and of those loud smacks?" she\r\nsaid with a laugh.\r\n\r\n"Jealous? perhaps so, Indiana; I am not sure. But when that red-cheeked\r\nyoung cousin puts his lips to yours, when he takes you in his arms to\r\nseat you on the horse that he _gives_ you and I _sell_ you, I confess\r\nthat I suffer. No, madame, I am not happy to see you the mistress of the\r\nhorse I loved. I can understand that one might be happy in giving him to\r\nyou; but to play the tradesman in order to provide another with the\r\nmeans of making himself agreeable to you, is a very cleverly managed\r\nhumiliation on Sir Ralph\'s part. If I did not believe that all this\r\ncunning was quite involuntary, I would like to be revenged on him."\r\n\r\n"Oh! fie! this jealousy is not becoming to you! How can our commonplace\r\nintimacy arouse any feeling in you, in you who should be, so far as I am\r\nconcerned, outside of the common life of mankind and should create for\r\nme a world of enchantment--in you of all men! I am displeased with you\r\nalready, Raymon; I perceive that there is something like wounded\r\nself-esteem in this angry feeling displayed toward this poor cousin. It\r\nseems to me that you are more jealous of the lukewarm preference which I\r\ndisplay for him in public than of the exclusive affection which I might\r\nsecretly entertain for another."\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, forgive me, Indiana, I am wrong! I am not worthy of you,\r\nangel of goodness and gentleness! but I confess that I have suffered\r\ncruelly because of the right that man has seemed to assume."\r\n\r\n"He assume rights, Raymon! Do you not know what sacred gratitude binds\r\nus to him? do you not know that his mother was my mother\'s sister? that\r\nwe were born in the same valley; that in our early years he was my\r\nprotector; that he was my mainstay, my only teacher, my only companion\r\nat Ile Bourbon; that he has followed me everywhere; that he left the\r\ncountry which I left, to come and live where I lived; in a word, that he\r\nis the only being who loves me and who takes any interest in my life?"\r\n\r\n"Curse him! all that you tell me, Indiana, inflames the wound. So he\r\nloves you very dearly, does this Englishman, eh? Do you know how I love\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! let us not compare the two. If an attachment of the same nature\r\nmade you rivals, I should owe the preference to the one of longer\r\nstanding. But have no fear, Raymon, that I shall ever ask you to love me\r\nas Ralph loves me."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about the man, I beg you; for who can penetrate his stone\r\nmask?"\r\n\r\n"Must I do the honors for my cousin?" she said with a smile. "I confess\r\nthat I do not altogether like the idea of describing him; I love him so\r\ndearly that I would like to flatter him; as he is, I am afraid that you\r\nwill not find him a very noble figure. Do try to help me; come, how does\r\nhe seem to you?"\r\n\r\n"His face--forgive me if I wound you--indicates absolute nonentity; but\r\nthere are signs of good sense and education in his conversation when he\r\ndeigns to speak; but he speaks so hesitatingly, so coldly, that no one\r\nprofits by his knowledge, his delivery is so depressing and tiresome.\r\nAnd then there is something commonplace and dull in his thoughts which\r\nis not redeemed by measured purity of expression. I think that his is a\r\nmind imbued with all the ideas that have been suggested to him, but too\r\napathetic and too mediocre to have any of his own. He is just the sort\r\nof man that one must be to be looked upon in society as a serious-minded\r\nperson. His gravity forms three-fourths of his merit, his indifference\r\nthe rest."\r\n\r\n"There is some truth in your portrait," said Indiana, "but there is\r\nprejudice too. You boldly solve doubts which I should not dare to solve,\r\nalthough I have known Ralph ever since I was born. It is true that his\r\ngreat defect consists in looking frequently through the eyes of others;\r\nbut that is not the fault of his mind but of his education. You think\r\nthat, without education, he would have been an absolute nonentity; I\r\nthink that he would have been less so than he is. I must tell you one\r\nfact in his life which will help to explain his character. He was\r\nunfortunate to have a brother whom his parents openly preferred to him;\r\nthis brother had all the brilliant qualities that he lacks. He learned\r\neasily, he had a taste for all the arts, he fairly sparkled with wit;\r\nhis face, while less regular than Ralph\'s, was more expressive. He was\r\naffectionate, zealous, active, in a word, he was lovable. Ralph, on the\r\ncontrary, was awkward, melancholy, undemonstrative; he loved solitude,\r\nlearned slowly and did not make a display of what little knowledge he\r\npossessed. When his parents saw how different he was from his older\r\nbrother, they maltreated him; they did worse than that: they humiliated\r\nhim. Thereupon, child as he was, his character became gloomy and pensive\r\nand an unconquerable timidity paralyzed all his faculties. They had\r\nsucceeded in inspiring in him self-aversion and self-contempt; he became\r\ndiscouraged with life, and, at the age of fifteen, he was attacked by\r\nthe spleen, a malady that is wholly physical under the foggy sky of\r\nEngland, wholly mental under the revivifying sky of Ile Bourbon. He has\r\noften told me that one day he left the house with a determination to\r\nthrow himself into the sea; but as he sat on the shore collecting his\r\nthoughts, as he was on the point of carrying out his plan, he saw me\r\ncoming toward him in the arms of the negress who had been my nurse. I\r\nwas then five years old. I was pretty, they say, and I manifested a\r\npredilection for my taciturn cousin which nobody shared. To be sure, he\r\nwas attentive and kind to me in a way I was not accustomed to in my\r\nfather\'s house. As we were both unhappy, we understood each other even\r\nthen. He taught me his father\'s language, and I lisped mine to him. This\r\nblending of Spanish and English may be said to express Ralph\'s\r\ncharacter. When I threw my arms around his neck, I saw that he was\r\nweeping, and, without knowing why, I began to weep too. Thereupon he\r\npressed me to his heart and, so he told me afterward, made a vow to live\r\nfor me, a neglected if not hated child, to whom his friendship would at\r\nall events be a kindness and his life of some benefit. Thus I was the\r\nfirst and only tie in his sad life. After that day we were hardly ever\r\napart; we passed our days leading a free and healthy life in the\r\nsolitude of the mountains. But perhaps these tales of our childhood bore\r\nyou, and you would prefer to join the hunt and have a gallop."\r\n\r\n"Foolish girl," said Raymon, seizing the bridle of Madame Delmare\'s\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n"Very well, I will go on," said she. "Edmond Brown, Ralph\'s older\r\nbrother, died at the age of twenty; his mother also died of grief, and\r\nhis father was inconsolable. Ralph would have been glad to mitigate his\r\nsorrow, but the coldness with which Monsieur Brown greeted his first\r\nattempts increased his natural timidity. He passed whole hours in\r\nmelancholy silence beside that heartbroken old man, not daring to\r\nproffer a word or a caress, he was so afraid that his consolation would\r\nseem misplaced or trivial. His father accused him of lack of feeling,\r\nand Edmond\'s death left Ralph more wretched and more misunderstood than\r\never. I was his only consolation."\r\n\r\n"I cannot pity him, whatever you may do," Raymon interrupted; "but there\r\nis one thing in his life and yours that I cannot understand: it is that\r\nyou never married."\r\n\r\n"I can give you a very good reason for that," she replied. "When I\r\nreached a marriageable age, Ralph, who was ten years older than I--an\r\nenormous difference in our climate, where the childhood of girls is so\r\nbrief--Ralph, I say, was already married."\r\n\r\n"Is Sir Ralph a widower? I never heard anyone mention his wife."\r\n\r\n"Never mention her to him. She was young and rich and lovely, but she\r\nhad been in love with Edmond--she had been betrothed to him; and when,\r\nin order to serve family interests and family sentiment, she was made to\r\nmarry Ralph, she did not so much as try to conceal her aversion for him.\r\nHe was obliged to go to England with her, and when he returned to Ile\r\nBourbon after his wife\'s death, I was married to Monsieur Delmare and\r\njust about to start for Europe. Ralph tried to live alone, but solitude\r\naggravated his misery. Although he has never mentioned Mistress Ralph\r\nBrown to me, I have every reason to believe that he was even more\r\nunhappy in his married life than he had been in his father\'s house, and\r\nthat his natural melancholy was increased by recent and painful\r\nmemories. He was attacked with the spleen again; whereupon he sold his\r\ncoffee plantation and came to France to settle down. His manner of\r\nintroducing himself to my husband was original, and would have made me\r\nlaugh if my good Ralph\'s attachment had not touched me deeply.\r\n\'Monsieur,\' he said, \'I love your wife; it was I who brought her up; I\r\nlook upon her as my sister and even more as my daughter. She is my only\r\nremaining relative and the only person to whom I am attached. Allow me\r\nto establish myself near you and let us three pass our lives together.\r\nThey say that you are a little jealous of your wife, but they say also\r\nthat you are a man of honor and uprightness. When I tell you that I have\r\nnever had any other than brotherly love for her, and that I shall never\r\nhave, you can regard me with as little anxiety as if I were really your\r\nbrother-in-law. Isn\'t it so, monsieur?\' Monsieur Delmare, who is very\r\nproud of his reputation for soldierly frankness, greeted this outspoken\r\ndeclaration with a sort of ostentatious confidence. But several months\r\nof careful watching were necessary before that confidence became as\r\ngenuine as he boasted that it was. Now it is as impregnable as Ralph\'s\r\nsteadfast and pacific heart."\r\n\r\n"Are you perfectly sure, Indiana," said Raymon, "that Sir Ralph is not\r\ndeceiving himself the least bit in the world when he swears that he\r\nnever loved you?"\r\n\r\n"I was twelve years old when he left Ile Bourbon to go with his wife to\r\nEngland; I was sixteen when he returned to find me married, and he\r\nmanifested more joy than sorrow. Now, Ralph is really an old man."\r\n\r\n"At twenty-nine?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t laugh at what I say. His face is young, but his heart is worn out\r\nby suffering, and he no longer loves anybody, in order to avoid\r\nsuffering."\r\n\r\n"Not even you?"\r\n\r\n"Not even me. His friendship is simply a matter of habit; it was\r\ngenerous in the old days when he took upon himself to protect and\r\neducate my childhood, and then I loved him as he loves me to-day because\r\nof the need I had of him. To-day my whole heart is bent upon paying my\r\ndebt to him, and my life is passed in trying to beautify and enliven\r\nhis. But, when I was a child, I loved him with the instinct rather than\r\nwith the heart, and he, now that he is a man, loves me less with the\r\nheart than with the instinct. I am necessary to him because I am almost\r\nalone in loving him; and to-day, as Monsieur Delmare manifests some\r\nattachment to him, he is almost as fond of him as of me. His protection,\r\nformerly so fearless in face of my father\'s despotism, has become\r\nlukewarm and cautious in face of my husband\'s. He never reproaches\r\nhimself because I suffer, provided that I am near him. He does not ask\r\nhimself if I am unhappy; it is enough for him to see that I am alive. He\r\ndoes not choose to lend me a support, which, while it would make my lot\r\nless cruel, would disturb his serenity by making trouble between him and\r\nMonsieur Delmare. By dint of hearing himself say again and again that\r\nhis heart is dry, he has persuaded himself that it is true, and his\r\nheart has withered in the inaction in which he has allowed it to fall\r\nasleep from distrust. He is a man whom the affection of another person\r\nmight have developed; but it was withdrawn from him and he shrivelled\r\nup. Now he asserts that happiness consists in repose, pleasure, in the\r\ncomforts of life. He asks no questions about cares that he has not. I\r\nmust say the word: Ralph is selfish."\r\n\r\n"Very good, so much the better," said Raymon; "I am no longer afraid of\r\nhim; indeed I will love him if you wish."\r\n\r\n"Yes, love him, Raymon," she replied; "he will appreciate it; and, so\r\nfar as we are concerned, let us never trouble ourselves to explain why\r\npeople love us, but how they love us. Happy the man who can be loved, no\r\nmatter for what reason!"\r\n\r\n"What you say, Indiana," replied Raymon, grasping her slender, willowy\r\nform, "is the lament of a sad and solitary heart; but, in my case, I\r\nwant you to know both why and how, especially why."\r\n\r\n"To give me happiness, is it not?" she said, with a sad but passionate\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n"To give you my life," said Raymon, brushing Indiana\'s floating hair\r\nwith his lips.\r\n\r\nA blast upon the horn near by warned them to be on their guard; it was\r\nSir Ralph, who saw them or did not see them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nRaymon was amazed at what seemed to take place in Indiana\'s being as\r\nsoon as the hounds were away. Her eyes gleamed, her cheeks flushed, the\r\ndilation of her nostrils betrayed an indefinable thrill of fear or\r\npleasure, and suddenly, driving her spurs into her horse\'s side, she\r\nleft him and galloped after Ralph. Raymon did not know that hunting was\r\nthe only passion that Ralph and Indiana had in common. Nor did he\r\nsuspect that in that frail and apparently timid woman there abode a more\r\nthan masculine courage, that sort of delirious intrepidity which\r\nsometimes manifests itself like a nervous paroxysm in the feeblest\r\ncreatures. Women rarely have the physical courage which consists in\r\noffering the resistance of inertia to pain or danger; but they often\r\nhave the moral courage which attains its climax in peril or suffering.\r\nIndiana\'s delicate fibres delighted above all things in the tumult, the\r\nrapid movement and the excitement of the chase, that miniature image of\r\nwar with its fatigues, its stratagems, its calculations, its hazards and\r\nits battles. Her dull, ennui-laden life needed this excitement; at such\r\ntimes she seemed to wake from a lethargy and to expend in one day all\r\nthe energy that she had left to ferment uselessly in her blood for a\r\nwhole year.\r\n\r\nRaymon was terrified to see her ride away so fast, abandoning herself\r\nfearlessly to the impetuous spirit of a horse that she hardly knew,\r\nrushing him through the thickets, avoiding with amazing skill the\r\nbranches that lashed at her face as they sprang back, leaping ditches\r\nwithout hesitation, venturing confidently on clayey, slippery ground,\r\nheedless of the risk of breaking her slender limbs, but eager to be\r\nfirst on the smoking scent of the boar. So much determination alarmed\r\nhim and nearly disgusted him with Madame Delmare. Men, especially\r\nlovers, are addicted to the innocent fatuity of preferring to protect\r\nweakness rather than to admire courage in womankind. Shall I confess it?\r\nRaymon was terrified at the promise of high spirit and tenacity in love\r\nwhich such intrepidity seemed to afford. It was not like the resignation\r\nof poor Noun, who preferred to drown herself rather than to contend\r\nagainst her misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration 03: _THE BOAR HUNT_\r\n_Raymon was terrified to see her ride away so\r\nfast, abandoning herself fearlessly to the impetuous\r\nspirit of a horse that she hardly knew, rushing him\r\nthrough the thickets, avoiding with amazing skill\r\nthe branches that lashed at her face as they sprang\r\nback, leaping ditches without hesitation, venturing\r\nconfidently on clayey, slippery ground, heedless of the\r\nrisk of breaking her slender limbs, but eager to be\r\nfirst on the smoking scent of the boar._]\r\n\r\n\r\n"If there\'s as much vigor and excitement in her tenderness as there is\r\nin her diversions," he thought; "if her will clings to me, fierce and\r\npalpitating, as her caprice clings to that boar\'s quarters, why society\r\nwill impose no fetters on her, the law will have no force; my destiny\r\nwill have to succumb and I shall have to sacrifice my future to her\r\npresent."\r\n\r\nCries of terror and distress, among which he could distinguish Madame\r\nDelmare\'s voice, roused Raymon from these reflections. He anxiously\r\nurged his horse forward and was soon overtaken by Ralph, who asked him\r\nif he had heard the outcries.\r\n\r\nAt that moment several terrified whippers-in rode up to them, crying out\r\nconfusedly that the boar had charged and overthrown Madame Delmare.\r\nOther huntsmen, in still greater dismay, appeared, calling for Sir\r\nRalph, whose surgical skill was required by the injured person.\r\n\r\n"It\'s of no use," said a late arrival. "There is no hope, your help will\r\nbe too late."\r\n\r\nIn that moment of horror, Raymon\'s eyes fell upon the pale, gloomy\r\nfeatures of Monsieur Brown. He did not cry out, he did not foam at the\r\nmouth, he did not wring his hands; he simply took out his hunting-knife\r\nand with a _sang-froid_ truly English was preparing to cut his own\r\nthroat, when Raymon snatched the weapon from him and hurried him in the\r\ndirection from which the cries came.\r\n\r\nRalph felt as if he were waking from a dream when he saw Madame Delmare\r\nrush to meet him and urge him forward to the assistance of her husband,\r\nwho lay on the ground, apparently lifeless. Sir Ralph made haste to\r\nbleed him; for he had speedily satisfied himself that he was not dead;\r\nbut his leg was broken and he was taken to the ch\xc3\xa2teau.\r\n\r\nAs for Madame Delmare, in the confusion her name had been substituted by\r\naccident for that of her husband, or perhaps Ralph and Raymon had\r\nerroneously thought that they heard the name in which they were most\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nIndiana was uninjured, but her fright and consternation had almost taken\r\naway her power of locomotion. Raymon supported her in his arms and was\r\nreconciled to her womanly heart when he saw how deeply affected she was\r\nby the misfortune of a husband whom she had much to forgive before\r\npitying him.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph had already recovered his accustomed tranquillity; but an\r\nextraordinary pallor revealed the violent shock he had experienced; he\r\nhad nearly lost one of the two human beings whom he loved.\r\n\r\nRaymon, who alone, in that moment of confusion and excitement, had\r\nretained sufficient presence of mind to understand what he saw, had been\r\nable to judge of Ralph\'s affection for his cousin, and how little it was\r\nbalanced by his feeling for the colonel. This observation, which\r\npositively contradicted Indiana\'s opinion, did not depart from Raymon\'s\r\nmemory as it did from that of the other witnesses of the scene.\r\n\r\nHowever Raymon never mentioned to Madame Delmare the attempted suicide\r\nof which he had been a witness. In this ungenerous reserve there was a\r\nsuggestion of selfishness and bad temper which you will forgive perhaps\r\nin view of the amorous jealousy which was responsible for it.\r\n\r\nAfter six weeks the colonel was with much difficulty removed to Lagny;\r\nbut it was more than six months thereafter before he could walk; for\r\nbefore the fractured femur was fairly reduced he had an acute attack of\r\nrheumatism in the injured leg, which condemned him to excruciating pain\r\nand absolute immobility. His wife lavished the most loving attentions\r\nupon him; she never left his bedside and endured without a complaint his\r\nbitter fault-finding humor, his soldier-like testiness and his invalid\'s\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nDespite the ennui of such a depressing life, her health became robust\r\nand flourishing once more and happiness took up its abode in her heart.\r\nRaymon loved her, he really loved her. He came every day; he was\r\ndiscouraged by no difficulty in the way of seeing her, he bore with the\r\ninfirmities of her husband, her cousin\'s coldness, the constraint of\r\ntheir interviews. A glance from him filled Indiana\'s heart with joy for\r\na whole day. She no longer thought of complaining of life; her heart was\r\nfull, her youthful nature had ample employment, her moral force had\r\nsomething to feed upon.\r\n\r\nThe colonel gradually came to feel very friendly to Raymon. He was\r\nsimple enough to believe that his neighbor\'s assiduity in calling upon\r\nhim was a proof of the interest he took in his health. Madame de\r\nRami\xc3\xa8re also came occasionally, to sanction the liaison by her\r\npresence, and Indiana became warmly and passionately attached to\r\nRaymon\'s mother. At last the wife\'s lover became the husband\'s friend.\r\n\r\nAs a result of being thus constantly thrown together, Raymon and Ralph\r\nperforce became intimate in a certain sense; they called each other "my\r\ndear fellow," they shook hands morning and night. If either of them\r\ndesired to ask a slight favor of the other, the regular form was this:\r\n"I count upon your friendship," etc. And when they spoke of each other\r\nthey said: "He is a friend of mine."\r\n\r\nBut, although they were both as frank and outspoken as a man can be in\r\nthe world, they were not at all fond of each other. They differed\r\nessentially in their opinions on every subject; they had no likes or\r\ndislikes in common; and, although they both loved Madame Delmare, they\r\nloved her in such a different way that that sentiment divided them\r\ninstead of bringing them together. They found a singular pleasure in\r\ncontradicting each other and in disturbing each other\'s equanimity as\r\nmuch as possible by reproaches which were none the less sharp and bitter\r\nbecause they took the form of generalities.\r\n\r\nTheir principal and most frequent controversies began with politics and\r\nended with morals. It was in the evening, when they were all assembled\r\naround Monsieur Delmare\'s easy-chair, that discussions arose on the most\r\ntrivial pretexts. They always maintained the external courtesy which\r\nphilosophy imposed on the one and social custom on the other: but they\r\nsometimes said to each other, under the thin veil of allusions, some\r\nvery harsh things, which amused the colonel; for he was naturally\r\nbellicose and quarrelsome and loved disputes in default of battles.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I believe that a man\'s political opinion is the whole man.\r\nTell me what your heart and your head are and I will tell you your\r\npolitical opinions. In whatever rank or political party chance may have\r\nplaced us at our birth, our character prevails sooner or later over the\r\nprejudice or artificial beliefs of education. You will call that a very\r\nsweeping statement perhaps; but how could I persuade myself to augur\r\nwell of a mind that clings to certain theories which a generous spirit\r\nrejects? Show me a man who maintains the usefulness of capital\r\npunishment, and, however conscientious and enlightened he may be, I defy\r\nyou ever to establish any sympathetic connection between him and me. If\r\nsuch a man attempts to instruct me as to facts which I do not know, he\r\nwill never succeed; for it will not be in my power to give him my\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nRalph and Raymon differed on all points, and, yet, before they knew each\r\nother, they had no clearly defined opinions. But, as soon as they were\r\nat odds, each of them maintained the contrary of what the other\r\nadvanced, and in that way they would form for themselves an absolute,\r\nunassailable conviction. Raymon was on all occasions the champion of\r\nexisting society, Ralph attacked its structure at every point.\r\n\r\nThe explanation was simple: Raymon was happy and treated with the utmost\r\nconsideration, Ralph had known nothing of life but its evils and its\r\nbitterness; one found everything very satisfactory, the other was\r\ndissatisfied with everything. Men and things had maltreated Ralph and\r\nheaped benefits upon Raymon; and, like two children, they referred\r\neverything to themselves, setting themselves up as a court of last\r\nresort in regard to the great questions of social order, although they\r\nwere equally incompetent.\r\n\r\nThus Ralph always upheld his visionary scheme of a republic from which\r\nhe proposed to exclude all abuses, all prejudices, all injustice; a\r\nscheme founded entirely upon the hope of a new race of men. Raymon\r\nupheld his doctrine of an hereditary monarchy, preferring, he said, to\r\nendure abuses, prejudice and injustice, to seeing scaffolds erected and\r\ninnocent blood shed.\r\n\r\nThe colonel was almost always on Ralph\'s side at the beginning of the\r\ndiscussion. He hated the Bourbons and imparted to all his opinions all\r\nthe animosity of his sentiments. But soon Raymon would adroitly bring\r\nhim over to his side by proving to him that the monarchy was in\r\nprinciple much nearer the Empire than the Republic. Ralph was so lacking\r\nin the power of persuasion, he was so sincere, so bungling, the poor\r\nbaronet! his frankness was so unpolished, his logic so dull, his\r\nprinciples so rigid! He spared no one, he softened no harsh truth.\r\n\r\n"_Parbleu!_" he would say to the colonel, when that worthy cursed\r\nEngland\'s intervention, "what in heaven\'s name have you, a man of some\r\ncommon sense and reasoning power, I suppose, to complain of because a\r\nwhole nation fought fairly against you?"\r\n\r\n"Fairly?" Delmare would repeat the word, grinding his teeth together and\r\nbrandishing his crutch.\r\n\r\n"Let us leave political questions to be decided by the powers\r\nconcerned," Sir Ralph would say, "as we have adopted a form of\r\ngovernment which forbids us to discuss our interests ourselves. If a\r\nnation is responsible for the faults of its legislature, what one can\r\nyou find that is guiltier than yours?"\r\n\r\n"And so I say, monsieur, shame upon France, which abandoned Napol\xc3\xa9on\r\nand submitted to a king proclaimed by the bayonets of foreigners!" the\r\ncolonel would exclaim.\r\n\r\n"For my part, I do not say shame upon France," Sir Ralph would rejoin,\r\n"but woe to her! I pity her because she was so weak and so diseased, on\r\nthe day she was purged of her tyrant, that she was compelled to accept\r\nyour rag of a constitutional Charter, a mere shred of liberty which you\r\nare beginning to respect now that you must throw it aside and conquer\r\nyour liberty over again."\r\n\r\nThereupon Raymon would pick up the gauntlet that Sir Ralph threw down. A\r\nknight of the Charter, he chose to be a knight of liberty as well, and\r\nhe proved to Ralph with marvelous skill that one was the expression of\r\nthe other; that, if he shattered the Charter he overturned his own idol.\r\nIn vain would the baronet struggle in the unsound arguments in which\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re entangled him; with admirable force he would argue\r\nthat a greater extension of the suffrage would infallibly lead to the\r\nexcesses of \'93, and that the nation was not yet ripe for liberty, which\r\nis not the same as license. And when Sir Ralph declared that it was\r\nabsurd to attempt to confine a constitution within a certain number of\r\narticles, that what was sufficient at first would eventually become\r\ninsufficient, supporting his argument by the example of the\r\nconvalescent, whose needs increased every day, Raymon would reply to all\r\nthese commonplaces expressed with difficulty by Monsieur Brown that the\r\nCharter was not an immovable circle, that it would stretch with the\r\nnecessities of France, attributing to it an elasticity which, he said,\r\nwould afford later a means of satisfying the demands of the nation, but\r\nwhich in fact satisfied only those of the crown.\r\n\r\nAs to Delmare, he had not advanced a step since 1815. He was a\r\nstationary mortal, as full of prejudices and as obstinate as the\r\n\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s at Coblentz, the never-failing subjects of his implacable\r\nirony. He was like an old child and had failed utterly to comprehend the\r\ngreat drama of the downfall of Napol\xc3\xa9on. He had seen naught but the\r\nfortune of war in that crisis when the power of public opinion\r\ntriumphed. He was forever talking of treason and of selling the country,\r\nas if a whole nation could betray a single man, as if France would have\r\nallowed herself to be sold by a few generals! He accused the Bourbons of\r\ntyranny and sighed for the glorious days of the Empire, when arms were\r\nlacking to till the soil and families were without bread. He declaimed\r\nagainst Franchet\'s police and extolled Fouch\xc3\xa9\'s. He was still at the\r\nday after Waterloo.\r\n\r\nIt was really a curious thing to listen to the sentimental idiocies of\r\nDelmare and Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re, philanthropic dreamers both, one under\r\nthe sword of Napol\xc3\xa9on, the other under the sceptre of Saint-Louis;\r\nMonsieur Delmare planted at the foot of the Pyramids, Raymon seated\r\nunder the monarchic shadow of the oak of Vincennes. Their Utopias, which\r\nclashed at first, became reconciled in due time: Raymon limed the\r\ncolonel with his chivalrous sentiments; for one concession he exacted\r\nten, and he accustomed him little by little to the spectacle of\r\ntwenty-five years of victory ascending in a spiral column under the\r\nfolds of the white flag. If Ralph had not constantly cast his abrupt,\r\nrough observations into the centre of Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s flowery\r\nrhetoric, he would infallibly have won Delmare over to the throne of\r\n1815; but Ralph irritated his self-esteem, and the bungling\r\noutspokenness with which the Englishman strove to shake his convictions\r\nserved only to anchor him more firmly in his imperialism. Thus all\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s efforts were wasted; Ralph trod heavily upon the\r\nflowers of his eloquence and the colonel returned with renewed\r\nenthusiasm to his tri-color. He swore that he would shake off the dust\r\nfrom it some fine day, that he would spit on the lilies and restore the\r\nDuc de Reichstadt to the throne of _his fathers_; he would begin anew\r\nthe conquest of the world; and he always concluded by lamenting the\r\ndisgrace that rested upon France, the rheumatism that glued him to his\r\nchair and the ingratitude of the Bourbons to the old moustaches whom the\r\nsun of the desert had burned and who had swarmed over the ice-floes of\r\nthe Moskowa.\r\n\r\n"My poor fellow!" Ralph would say, "for heaven\'s sake be fair; you\r\ncomplain because the Restoration did not pay for services rendered the\r\nEmpire and because it did reimburse its _\xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s._ Tell me, if\r\nNapol\xc3\xa9on could come to life again to-morrow in all his power, would you\r\nlike it if he should withdraw his favor from you and bestow it on the\r\npartisans of legitimacy? Every one for himself and his own; these are\r\nbusiness discussions, disputes concerning private interests, which have\r\nlittle interest for France, now that you are almost all as incapacitated\r\nas the _voltigeurs_ of the emigration, and that, whether gouty, married\r\nor sulking, you are all equally useless to her. However, she must\r\nsupport you all, and you see who can complain the loudest of her. When\r\nthe day of the Republic dawns, she will clear her skirts of all your\r\ndemands, and it will be no more than justice."\r\n\r\nThese trivial but self-evident observations offended the colonel like so\r\nmany personal affronts; and Ralph who, with all his good sense, did not\r\nrealize that the pettiness of spirit of a man whom he esteemed could go\r\nso far, fell into the habit of irritating him without mercy.\r\n\r\nBefore Raymon\'s arrival there had been a tacit agreement between the two\r\nto avoid every subject of controversy in which there might be some\r\nclashing and wounding of delicate sensibilities. But Raymon brought into\r\ntheir conversation all the subtleties of the language, all the petty\r\nartifices of civilization. He taught them that people can say anything\r\nto one another, indulge in all sorts of reproaches and shield themselves\r\nbehind the pretext of legitimate discussion. He introduced among them\r\nthe habit of disputation, then tolerated in the salons, because the\r\nvindictive passions of the Hundred Days had finally become appeased, had\r\nassumed divers milder shades. But the colonel had retained all the\r\nvehemence of his passions, and Ralph made a sad mistake in thinking that\r\nit was possible for him to listen to reason. Monsieur Delmare became\r\ndaily more sour toward him and drew nearer to Raymon, who, without\r\nmaking too extensive concessions, knew how to assume an appearance of\r\ngraciousness in order to spare the other\'s self-esteem.\r\n\r\nIt is a great imprudence to introduce politics as a pastime in the\r\ndomestic circle. If there exist to-day any peaceful and happy families,\r\nI advise them to subscribe to no newspaper; not to read a single line of\r\nthe budget, to bury themselves in the depth of their country estates as\r\nin an oasis, and to draw between themselves and the rest of society a\r\nline that none may pass; for, if they allow the echoes of our disputes\r\nto meet their ears, it is all over with their union and their repose. It\r\nis hard to imagine how much gall and bitterness political differences\r\ncause between near kindred. Most of the time they simply afford them an\r\nopportunity for reproaching one another for defects of character, mental\r\nobliquities and vices of the heart.\r\n\r\nThey would not dare to call one another knave, imbecile, ambitious\r\nvillain or poltroon. They express the same idea by such names as\r\n_jesuit, royalist, revolutionist_ and _trimmer._ These are different\r\nwords, but the insult is the same, and all the more stinging because\r\nthey may pursue and attack one another in this fashion without\r\nrestraint, without mercy. There is an end to all mutual toleration of\r\nfailings, all charitable spirit, all generous and delicate reserve;\r\nnothing is overlooked, everything is attributed to political feeling,\r\nand beneath that mask hatred and vengeance are freely exhaled. O ye\r\nblessed dwellers in the country, if there still be any country in\r\nFrance, shun, shun politics, and read the _Peau d\'Ane_ by your\r\nfiresides! But the contagion is so great that there is no retreat\r\nobscure enough, no solitude profound enough to hide and shelter the man\r\nwho would find a refuge for his amiable heart from the tempests of our\r\ncivil dissensions.\r\n\r\nIn vain had the little ch\xc3\xa2teau in Brie defended itself for years\r\nagainst this ill-omened invasion; it lost in time its heedlessness, its\r\nactive domestic life, its long evenings of silence and meditation. Noisy\r\ndisputes awoke its slumbering echoes; bitter and threatening words\r\nterrified the faded cherubs who had smiled amid the dust of the hangings\r\nfor a hundred years past. The excitements of present-day life found\r\ntheir way into that ancient dwelling, and all those old-fashioned\r\nsplendors, all those relics of a period of pleasure and frivolity saw\r\nwith dismay the advent of an epoch of doubt and declamation, represented\r\nby three men who shut themselves up together every day to quarrel from\r\nmorning till night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite these never-ending dissensions, Madame Delmare clung with the\r\nconfidence of her years to the hope of a happy future. It was her first\r\nhappiness; and her ardent imagination, her rich young heart, were able\r\nto supply it with all that it lacked. She was ingenious in creating keen\r\nand pure joys for herself--in bestowing upon herself the complement of\r\nthe precarious favors of her destiny. Raymon loved her. In truth he did\r\nnot lie when he told her that she was the only love of his life; he had\r\nnever loved so innocently nor so long. With her he forgot everything but\r\nher. The world and politics were blotted out by the thought of her; he\r\nenjoyed the domestic life, the being treated like one of the family, as\r\nshe treated him. He admired her patience and her strength of will; he\r\nwondered at the contrast between her mind and her character; he wondered\r\nespecially that, after importing so much solemnity into their first\r\ncompact, she was so unexacting, satisfied with such furtive and\r\ninfrequent joys, and that she trusted him so blindly and so absolutely.\r\nBut love was a novel and generous passion in her heart, and a thousand\r\nnoble and delicate sentiments were included in it and gave it a force\r\nwhich Raymon could not understand.\r\n\r\nFor his own part, he was annoyed at first by the constant presence of\r\nthe husband or the cousin. He had intended that this love should be like\r\nall his previous loves, but Indiana soon compelled him to rise to her\r\nlevel. The resignation with which she endured the constant surveillance,\r\nthe happy air with which she glanced at him by stealth, her eyes which\r\nspoke to him in eloquent though silent language, her sublime smile when\r\na sudden allusion in conversation brought their hearts nearer\r\ntogether--these soon became keen pleasures which Raymon craved and\r\nappreciated, thanks to the refinement of his mind and the culture of\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nWhat a difference between that chaste creature who seemed not to\r\ncontemplate the possibility of a _d\xc3\xa9no\xc3\xbbment_ to her love and all those\r\nother women who were intent only upon hastening it while pretending to\r\nshun it! When Raymon happened to be alone with her, Indiana\'s cheeks did\r\nnot turn a deeper red, nor did she avert her eyes in confusion. No, her\r\ntranquil, limpid eyes were always fixed upon him in ecstasy; an angelic\r\nsmile played always about her lips, as ruddy as a little girl\'s who has\r\nknown no kisses but her mother\'s. When he saw her so trustful, so\r\npassionate, so pure, living solely with the heart and not realizing that\r\nher lover\'s heart was in torment when he was at her feet, Raymon dared\r\nnot be a man, lest he should seem to her inferior to her dreams of him,\r\nand, through self-love, he became as virtuous as she.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare, ignorant as a genuine creole, had never dreamed hitherto\r\nof considering the momentous questions that were now discussed before\r\nher every day. She had been brought up by Sir Ralph, who had a poor\r\nopinion of the intelligence and reasoning power of womankind, and who\r\nhad confined himself to imparting some positive information likely to be\r\nof immediate use. Thus she had a very shadowy idea of the world\'s\r\nhistory, and any serious discussion bored her to death. But when she\r\nheard Raymon apply to those dry subjects all the charm of his wit, all\r\nthe poesy of his language, she listened and tried to understand; then\r\nshe ventured timidly to ask ingenuous questions which a girl of ten\r\nbrought up according to worldly ideas would readily have answered.\r\nRaymon took pleasure in enlightening that virgin mind which seemed\r\ndestined to open to receive his principles; but, despite the power he\r\nexerted over her untrained, artless mind, his sophisms sometimes\r\nencountered resistance from her.\r\n\r\nIndiana opposed to the interests of civilization, when raised to the\r\ndignity of principles of action, the straight-forward ideas and simple\r\nlaws of good sense and humanity; her arguments were characterized by an\r\nunpolished freedom which sometimes embarrassed Raymon and always charmed\r\nhim by its childlike originality. He applied himself as to a task of\r\nserious importance to the attempt to bring her around gradually to his\r\nprinciples, to his beliefs. He would have been proud to dominate her\r\nconscientious and naturally enlightened convictions; but he had some\r\ndifficulty in attaining his end. Ralph\'s generous theories, his\r\nunbending hatred of the vices of society, his keen impatience for the\r\nreign of other laws and other morals were sentiments to which Indiana\'s\r\nunhappy memories responded. But Raymon suddenly unhorsed his adversary\r\nby demonstrating that this aversion for the present was the work of\r\nselfishness; he described with much warmth his own attachments, his\r\ndevotion to the royal family, which he had the art to clothe with all\r\nthe heroism of a perilous loyalty, his respect for the persecuted faith\r\nof his fathers, his religious sentiments, which were not the fruit of\r\nreasoning, he said, but to which he clung by instinct and from\r\nnecessity. And the joy of loving one\'s fellow-creatures, of being bound\r\nto the present generation by all the ties of honor and philanthropy; the\r\npleasure of serving one\'s country by repelling dangerous innovations, by\r\nmaintaining domestic peace, by giving, if need be, all one\'s blood to\r\nsave the shedding of one drop of that of the lowest of one\'s countrymen!\r\nhe depicted all these attractive Utopian visions with so much art and\r\ncharm that Indiana submitted to be led on to the feeling that she must\r\nlove and respect all that Raymon loved and respected. It was fairly\r\nproved that Ralph was an egotist; when he maintained a generous idea,\r\nthey smiled; it was clear that at such times his heart and his mind were\r\nin contradiction. Was it not better to believe Raymon, who had such a\r\nbig, warm, expansive heart?\r\n\r\nThere were moments, however, when Raymon almost forgot his love to think\r\nonly of his antipathy. When he was with Madame Delmare, he could see\r\nnobody but Sir Ralph, who presumed, with his rough, cool common sense,\r\nto attack him, a man of superior talents, who had overthrown such\r\ndoughty adversaries! He was humiliated to find himself engaged with so\r\npaltry an adversary, and thereupon would overwhelm him with the weight\r\nof his eloquence; he would bring into play all the resources of his\r\ntalent, and Ralph, bewildered, slow in collecting his ideas, slower\r\nstill in expressing them, would be made painfully conscious of his\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nAt such moments it seemed to Indiana that Raymon\'s thoughts were\r\naltogether diverted from her; she had spasms of anxiety and terror as\r\nshe reflected that perhaps all those noble and high-sounding sentiments\r\nso eloquently declaimed were simply the pompous scaffolding of words,\r\nthe ironical harangue of the lawyer, listening to himself and practising\r\nthe comedy which is to take by surprise the good-nature of the tribunal.\r\nShe was especially fearful when, as her eyes met his, she fancied that\r\nshe saw gleaming in them, not the pleasure of having been understood by\r\nher, but the triumphant self-satisfaction of having made a fine\r\nargument. She was afraid at such times, and her thoughts turned to\r\nRalph, the egotist, to whom they had perhaps been unjust; but Ralph was\r\nnot tactful enough to say anything to prolong this uncertainty, and\r\nRaymon was very skilful in removing it.\r\n\r\nThus there was but one really perturbed existence, but one really ruined\r\nhappiness in that domestic circle: the existence and happiness of Sir\r\nRalph Brown, a man born to misfortune, for whom life had displayed no\r\nbrilliant aspects, no intense, heart-filling joys; a victim of great but\r\nsecret unhappiness, who complained to no one and whom no one pitied; a\r\ntruly accursed destiny, in the poetic sense without thrilling\r\nadventures; a commonplace, bourgeois, melancholy destiny, which no\r\nfriendship had sweetened, no love charmed, which was endured in silence,\r\nwith the heroism which the love of life and the need of hoping give; a\r\nlonely mortal who had had a father and mother like everybody else, a\r\nbrother, a wife, a son, a friend, and who had reaped no benefit,\r\nretained nothing of all those ties; a stranger in life who went his way\r\nmelancholy and indifferent, having not even that exalted consciousness\r\nof his misfortune which enables one to find some fascination in sorrow.\r\n\r\nDespite his strength of character, he sometimes felt discouraged with\r\nvirtue. He hated Raymon, and it was in his power to drive him from Lagny\r\nwith a word; but he did not say it, because he had one belief, a single\r\none, which was stronger than Raymon\'s countless beliefs. It was neither\r\nthe church, nor the monarchy, nor society, nor reputation, nor the law,\r\nwhich dictated his sacrifices and his courage--it was his conscience.\r\n\r\nHe had lived so alone that he had not accustomed himself to rely upon\r\nothers; but he had learned, in his isolation, to know himself. He had\r\nmade a friend of his own heart; by dint of self-communion, of asking\r\nhimself the cause of the unjust acts of others, he had assured himself\r\nthat he had not earned them by any vice; he had ceased to be irritated\r\nby them, because he set little store by his own personality, which he\r\nknew to be insipid and commonplace. He understood the indifference of\r\nwhich he was the object, and he had chosen his course with regard to it;\r\nbut his heart told him that he was capable of feeling all that he did\r\nnot inspire, and, while he was disposed to forgive everything in others,\r\nhe had decided to tolerate nothing in himself. This wholly inward life,\r\nthese wholly private sensations gave him all the outward appearance of a\r\nselfish man; indeed nothing resembles selfishness more closely than\r\nself-respect.\r\n\r\nHowever, as it often happens that, because we attempt to do too much\r\ngood, we do much less than enough, it happened that Sir Ralph made a\r\ngreat mistake from over-scrupulousness and caused Madame Delmare an\r\nirreparable injury from dread of burdening his own conscience with a\r\ncause of reproach. That mistake was his failure to enlighten her as to\r\nthe real reasons of Noun\'s death. Had he done so she would doubtless\r\nhave reflected on the perils of her love for Raymon; but we shall see\r\nlater why Monsieur Brown dared not inform his cousin and what painful\r\nscruples led him to keep silence on so momentous a question. When he\r\ndecided to break his silence it was too late; Raymon had had time to\r\nestablish his empire.\r\n\r\nAn unforeseen event occurred to cloud the future prospects of the\r\ncolonel and his wife; a business house in Belgium, upon which all the\r\nprosperity of the Delmare establishment depended, had suddenly failed,\r\nand the colonel, who had hardly recovered his health, started in hot\r\nhaste for Antwerp.\r\n\r\nHe was still so weak and ill that his wife wished to accompany him; but\r\nMonsieur Delmare, being threatened with complete ruin and resolved to\r\nhonor all his obligations, feared that his journey would then seem too\r\nmuch like a flight; so he determined to leave his wife at Lagny as a\r\npledge of his return. He even declined the company of Sir Ralph and\r\nbegged him to remain and stand by Madame Delmare in case of any trouble\r\non the part of anxious or over-eager creditors.\r\n\r\nAt this painful crisis Indiana was alarmed at nothing save the\r\npossibility of having to leave Lagny and be separated from Raymon; but\r\nhe comforted her by convincing her that the colonel would surely go to\r\nParis. Moreover he gave her his word that he would follow her, on some\r\npretext or other, wherever she might go, and the credulous creature\r\ndeemed herself almost happy in a misfortune which enabled her to put\r\nRaymon\'s love to the test. As for him, a vague hope, a persistent,\r\nimportunate thought had absorbed his mind ever since he had heard of\r\nthis event: he was to be alone with Indiana at last, the first time for\r\nsix months. She had never seemed to attempt to avoid a t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate,\r\nand although he was in no haste to triumph over a love whose ingenuous\r\nchastity had for him the attraction of novelty, he was beginning to feel\r\nthat his honor was involved in bringing it to some conclusion. He\r\nhonorably repelled any malicious insinuation concerning his relations\r\nwith Madame Delmare; he declared very modestly that there was nothing\r\nmore than a placid and pleasant friendship between them; but not for\r\nanything in the world would he have admitted, even to his best friend,\r\nthat he had been passionately in love for six months and had as yet\r\nobtained no fruit of that love.\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat disappointed in his anticipations when he saw that Sir\r\nRalph seemed determined to replace Monsieur Delmare so far as\r\nsurveillance was concerned, that he appeared at Lagny in the morning and\r\ndid not return to Bellerive until night; indeed, as their road was the\r\nsame for some distance, Ralph, with an intolerable affectation of\r\ncourtesy, insisted upon timing his departure by Raymon\'s. This\r\nconstraint soon became intensely disagreeable to Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re,\r\nand Madame Delmare fancied that she could detect in it not only a\r\nsuspicion insulting to herself, but a purpose to assume despotic control\r\nover her conduct.\r\n\r\nRaymon dared not request a secret interview; whenever he had made the\r\nattempt, Madame Delmare had reminded him of certain conditions agreed\r\nupon between them. Meanwhile a week had passed since the colonel\'s\r\ndeparture; he might return very soon; the present opportunity must be\r\nturned to advantage. To allow Sir Ralph the victory would be a disgrace\r\nto Raymon. One morning he slipped this letter into Madame Delmare\'s\r\nhand:\r\n\r\n"Indiana! do you not love me as I love you? My angel! I am unhappy and\r\nyou do not see it. I am sad, anxious concerning your future, not my own;\r\nfor, wherever you may be, there I shall live and die. But the thought of\r\npoverty alarms me on your account; ill and frail as you are, my poor\r\nchild, how will you endure privation? You have a rich and generous\r\ncousin: your husband will perhaps accept at his hands what he will\r\nrefuse at mine. Ralph will ameliorate your lot, and I shall be able to\r\ndo nothing for you!\r\n\r\n"Be sure, be sure, my dear love, that I have reason to be depressed and\r\ndisappointed. You are heroic, you laugh at everything, you insist that I\r\nmust not grieve. Ah! how I crave your gentle words, your sweet glances,\r\nto sustain my courage! But, by a monstrous fatality, these days that I\r\nhoped to pass freely at your feet, have brought me nothing but a\r\nconstraint that grows ever more galling.\r\n\r\n"Say a word, Indiana, so that we may be alone at least an hour, that I\r\nmay weep upon your white hands and tell you all that I suffer, and that\r\na word from you may console and comfort me.\r\n\r\n"And then, Indiana, I have a childish caprice, a genuine lover\'s\r\ncaprice. I would like to enter your room. Oh! don\'t be frightened, my\r\ngentle creole! It is my bounden duty not only to respect you, but to\r\nfear you; that is the very reason why I would like to enter your room,\r\nto kneel in that place where you were so angry with me, and where, bold\r\nas I am, I dared not look at you. I would like to prostrate myself\r\nthere, to pass a meditative, happy hour there; I would crave no other\r\nfavor, Indiana, than that you should place your hand on my heart and\r\ncleanse it of its crime, pacify it if it beats too rapidly, and give it\r\nyour confidence once more if you find me worthy of you at last. Yes! I\r\nwould like to prove to you that now I am worthy, that I know you through\r\nand through, that I worship you with an adoration as pure and holy as\r\never maiden conceived for her Madonna! I would like to be sure that you\r\nno longer fear me, that you esteem me as much as I revere you; I would\r\nlike to live an hour as angels live, with my head upon your heart. Tell\r\nme, Indiana, may I? One hour--the first, perhaps the last!\r\n\r\n"It is time to forgive me, Indiana, to give me back your confidence, so\r\ncruelly snatched from me, so dearly redeemed. Are you not satisfied with\r\nme? Have I not passed six months behind your chair, confining my desires\r\nto a glance at your snow-white neck through the curls of your black\r\nhair, as you leaned over your work, to a breath of the perfume which\r\nemanates from you and which the air from the window at which you sit\r\nbrings faintly to my nostrils? Does not such submission deserve the\r\nreward of a kiss? a sister\'s kiss, if you will, a kiss on the forehead?\r\nI will remain true to our agreements, I swear it. I will ask for\r\nnothing. But, cruel one, will you grant me nothing? Are you afraid of\r\nyourself?"\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare went to her room to read this letter; she replied to it\r\ninstantly, and handed him the reply with a key to the park-gate, which\r\nhe knew too well.\r\n\r\n"I afraid of you, Raymon? Oh! no, not now. I know too well that you love\r\nme, I am too blissfully happy in the belief that you love me. Come then,\r\nfor I am not afraid of myself either; if I loved you less, perhaps I\r\nshould be less calm; but I love you with a love of which you yourself\r\nhave no idea. Go away early, so that Ralph may suspect nothing. Return\r\nat midnight; you are familiar with the park and the house; here is the\r\nkey of the small gate; lock it after you."\r\n\r\nThis ingenuous, generous confidence made Raymon blush. He had tried to\r\ninspire it, with the purpose of abusing it; he had counted on the\r\ndarkness, the opportunity, the danger. If Indiana had shown any fear,\r\nshe was lost; but she was perfectly calm; she placed her trust in his\r\ngood faith; he swore that he would give her no cause to repent. But the\r\nimportant point was to pass a night in her bedroom, in order not to be a\r\nfool in his own eyes, in order to defeat Ralph\'s prudence, and to be\r\nable to laugh at him in his sleeve. That was a personal gratification\r\nwhich he craved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Ralph was really intolerable on this particular evening; he had\r\nnever been more stupid and dull and tiresome. He could say nothing\r\napropos, and, to cap the climax of his loutishness, he gave no sign of\r\ntaking his leave even when the evening was far advanced. Madame Delmare\r\nbegan to be ill at ease; she glanced alternately at the clock, which had\r\nstruck eleven--at the door, which had creaked in the wind--and at the\r\nexpressionless face of her cousin, who sat opposite her in front of the\r\nfire, placidly watching the blaze without seeming to suspect that his\r\npresence was distasteful.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Ralph\'s tranquil mask, his petrified features, concealed at that\r\nmoment a profound and painful mental agitation. He was a man whom\r\nnothing escaped because he observed everything with perfect\r\nself-possession. He had not been deceived by Raymon\'s pretended\r\ndeparture; he perceived very plainly Madame Delmare\'s anxiety at that\r\nmoment. He suffered more than she did herself, and he moved irresolutely\r\nbetween the impulse to give her a salutary warning and the fear of\r\ngiving way to feelings which he disavowed; at last his cousin\'s interest\r\ncarried the day, and he summoned all his moral courage in order to break\r\nthe silence.\r\n\r\n"That reminds me," he said abruptly, following out the line of thought\r\nwith which his mind was busy, "that it was just a year ago to-day that\r\nyou and I sat in this chimney-corner as we are sitting now. The clock\r\nmarked almost the same hour; the weather was cold and threatening as it\r\nis to-night. You were ill, and were disturbed by melancholy ideas; a\r\nfact that almost makes me believe in the truth of presentiments."\r\n\r\n"What can he be coming to?" thought Madame Delmare, gazing at her cousin\r\nwith mingled surprise and uneasiness.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember, Indiana," he continued, "that you felt even less well\r\nthan usual that night? Why, I can remember your words as if I had just\r\nheard them. \'You will call me insane,\' you said, \'but some danger is\r\nhovering about us and threatening some one of us--threatening me, I have\r\nno doubt,\' you added; \'I feel intensely agitated, as if some great\r\ncrisis in my destiny were at hand--I am afraid!\' Those are your very\r\nwords."\r\n\r\n"I am no longer ill," said Indiana, who had suddenly turned as pale as\r\nat the time of which Sir Ralph spoke; "I no longer believe in such\r\nfoolish terrors."\r\n\r\n"But I believe in them," he rejoined, "for you were a true prophet that\r\nnight, Indiana; a great danger did threaten us--a disastrous influence\r\nsurrounded this peaceful abode."\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_ I do not understand you!"\r\n\r\n"You soon will understand me, my poor girl. That was the evening that\r\nRaymon de Rami\xc3\xa8re was brought here. Do you remember in what condition?"\r\n\r\nRalph paused a few seconds, but dared not look at his cousin. As she\r\nmade no reply, he continued:\r\n\r\n"I was told to bring him back to life and I did so, as much to satisfy\r\nyou as to obey the instincts of humanity; but, in truth, Indiana, it was\r\na great misfortune that I saved that man\'s life! It was I who did all\r\nthe harm."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what you mean by harm!" rejoined Indiana, dryly.\r\n\r\nShe was deeply moved in advance by the explanation which she foresaw.\r\n\r\n"I mean that unfortunate creature\'s death," said Ralph. "But for him she\r\nwould still be alive; but for his fatal love the lovely, honest girl who\r\nloved you so dearly would still be at your side."\r\n\r\nThus far Madame Delmare did not understand. She was exasperated beyond\r\nmeasure by the strange and cruel method which her cousin adopted to\r\nreproach her for her attachment to Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\n"Enough of this," she said, rising.\r\n\r\nBut Ralph apparently took no notice of her remark.\r\n\r\n"What always astonished me," he continued, "was that you never guessed\r\nthe real motive that led Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re to scale the walls."\r\n\r\nA suspicion darted through Indiana\'s mind; her legs trembled under her,\r\nand she resumed her seat.\r\n\r\nRalph had buried the knife in her breast and made a ghastly wound. He no\r\nsooner saw the effect of his work than he hated himself for it; he\r\nthought only of the injury he had inflicted on the person whom he loved\r\nbest in all the world; he felt that his heart was breaking. He would\r\nhave wept bitterly if he could have wept; but the poor fellow had not\r\nthe gift of tears; he had naught of that which eloquently translates the\r\nlanguage of the heart. The external coolness with which he performed the\r\ncruel operation gave him the air of an executioner in Indiana\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"This is the first time," she said bitterly, "that I have known your\r\nantipathy for Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re to lead you to employ weapons that\r\nare unworthy of you; but I do not see how it assists your vengeance to\r\nstain the memory of a person who was dear to me, and whom her melancholy\r\nend should have made sacred to us. I have asked you no questions, Sir\r\nRalph; I do not know what you refer to. With your permission I will\r\nlisten to no more."\r\n\r\nShe rose and left Monsieur Brown bewildered and crushed.\r\n\r\nHe had foreseen that he could not enlighten Madame Delmare except at his\r\nown expense. His conscience had told him that he must speak, whatever\r\nthe result might be, and he had done it with all the abruptness of\r\nmethod, all the awkwardness of execution of which he was capable. What\r\nhe had not fully appreciated was the violence of a remedy so long\r\ndelayed.\r\n\r\nHe left Lagny in despair and wandered through the forest in a sort of\r\nfrenzy.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight; Raymon was at the park gate. He opened it, but as he\r\nopened it he felt his brow grow chill. For what purpose had he come to\r\nthis rendezvous? He had made divers virtuous resolutions, but would he\r\nbe amply rewarded by a chaste interview, by a sisterly kiss, for the\r\ntorture he was undergoing at that moment? For, if you remember under\r\nwhat circumstances he had previously passed through those garden paths,\r\nstealthily, at night, you will understand that it required a certain\r\ndegree of moral courage to go in search of pleasure along such a road\r\nand amid such memories.\r\n\r\nLate in October the climate of the suburbs of Paris becomes damp and\r\nfoggy, especially at night and in the neighborhood of streams. Chance\r\ndecreed that the fog should be as dense on this night as on certain\r\nother nights in the preceding spring. Raymon felt his way along the\r\nmist-enveloped trees. He passed a summer-house which contained a fine\r\ncollection of geraniums in winter. He glanced at the door, and his heart\r\nbeat fast at the extravagant idea that it might open and give egress to\r\na woman wrapped in a pelisse. Raymon smiled at this superstitious\r\nweakness and went his way. Nevertheless the cold seized him, and he felt\r\nan unpleasant tightness at his throat as he approached the stream.\r\n\r\nHe had to cross it to reach the flower-garden, and the only means of\r\ncrossing in that vicinity was a narrow wooden bridge. The fog became\r\nmore dismal than ever over the river-bed, and Raymon clung to the\r\nrailing of the bridge in order not to go astray among the reeds that\r\ngrew along the banks. The moon was just rising, and, as it strove to\r\npierce the vapors, cast an uncertain light on the plants which the wind\r\nand the current moved to and fro. In the breeze which rustled the leaves\r\nand ruffled the surface of the water there was a sort of wailing sound\r\nlike human words half-spoken. There was a faint sob close beside Raymon\r\nand a sudden movement among the reeds; it was a curlew flying away at\r\nhis approach. The cry of that shore-bird closely resembles the moaning\r\nof an abandoned child; and when it comes up from among the reeds you\r\nwould say that it was the last effort of a drowning man. Perhaps you\r\nwill consider that Raymon was very weak and cowardly; his teeth\r\nchattered and he nearly fell; but he soon realized the absurdity of his\r\nterror and crossed the bridge.\r\n\r\nHe was half-way across when a human figure appeared in front of him, at\r\nthe end of the rail, as if waiting for him to approach. Raymon\'s ideas\r\nbecame confused; his bewildered brain had not the strength to reason. He\r\nretraced his steps and hid among the trees, gazing with a fixed,\r\nterrified stare at that ill-defined apparition which remained in the\r\nsame place, as vague and uncertain as the river mist and the trembling\r\nrays of the moon. He was beginning to believe that in his mental\r\npreoccupation he had been deceived, and that what he took for a human\r\nform was only a tree-trunk or the stalk of a shrub, when he distinctly\r\nsaw it move and walk toward him.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, had not his legs absolutely refused to act, he would\r\nhave fled in as great a panic as the child who passes a cemetery at\r\nnight and fancies that he hears mysterious steps running after him on\r\nthe tips of the blades of grass. But he felt as if he were paralyzed,\r\nand, to support himself, threw his arms around the trunk of the willow\r\nbehind which he was hidden. The next moment Sir Ralph, wrapped in a\r\nlight cloak which gave him the aspect of a phantom at three yards,\r\npassed very close to him and took the path by which he had just come.\r\n\r\n"Bungling spy!" thought Raymon, as he saw him looking for his\r\nfootprints. "I will escape your cowardly surveillance, and while you are\r\nmounting guard here I will be enjoying myself yonder."\r\n\r\nHe crossed the bridge as lightly as a bird, and with the confidence of a\r\nlover. His terrors were at an end; Noun had never existed; real life was\r\nawakening all about him; Indiana awaited him yonder; and Ralph was on\r\nsentry-go to keep him from entering.\r\n\r\n"Watch closely," said Raymon, gayly, as he saw him in the distance going\r\nin the opposite direction. "Watch for me, dear Sir Rodolphe Brown;\r\nprotect my good fortune, O my officious friend; and, if the dogs are\r\nrestless, if the servants wake, pacify them, keep them quiet by saying:\r\n\'It is I who am watching, sleep in peace.\'"\r\n\r\nScruples, remorse, virtue were at an end for Raymon; he had paid dearly\r\nenough for the hour that was striking. His blood that had frozen in his\r\nveins flowed now toward his brain with maddening violence. A moment ago\r\nthe pallid terrors of death, dismal visions of the tomb; now the\r\nimpetuous realities of love, the keen joys of life. Raymon felt as bold\r\nand full of animation as in the morning, when an ugly dream has\r\nenveloped us in its shroud and suddenly a merry sunbeam awakens and\r\nrevivifies us.\r\n\r\n"Poor Ralph!" he thought as he ascended the secret staircase with a\r\nbold, light step, "you would have it so!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THIRD\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nOn leaving Sir Ralph, Madame Delmare had locked herself into her room,\r\nand a thousand tempestuous thoughts had invaded her mind. It was not the\r\nfirst time that a vague suspicion had cast its ominous light upon the\r\nfragile edifice of her happiness. Monsieur Delmare had previously let\r\nslip in conversation some of those indelicate jests which pass for\r\ncompliments. He had complimented Raymon on his knightly triumphs in a\r\nway to give the cue to ears that knew naught of the incident. Every time\r\nthat Madame Delmare had spoken to the gardener, Noun\'s name had been\r\ninjected, as if by an unavoidable necessity, into the most trivial\r\ndetails, and then Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s had always glided in by virtue\r\nof some mysterious junction of ideas which seemed to have taken\r\npossession of the man\'s brain and to beset him in spite of himself.\r\nMadame Delmare had been struck by his strange and bungling questions. He\r\nbecame confused in his speech on the slightest pretext; he seemed to be\r\noppressed by a burden of remorse which he betrayed while struggling to\r\nconceal it. At other times Indiana had found in Raymon\'s own confusion\r\nthose indications which she did not seek, but which forced themselves\r\nupon her. One circumstance in particular would have enlightened her\r\nfurther, if she had not closed her mind to all distrust. They had found\r\non Noun\'s finger a very handsome ring which Madame Delmare had noticed\r\nsome time before her death and which the girl claimed to have found.\r\nSince her death Madame Delmare had always worn that pledge of sorrow,\r\nand she had often noticed that Raymon changed color when he took her\r\nhand to put it to his lips. Once he had begged her never to mention Noun\r\nto him because he looked upon himself as the cause of her death; and\r\nwhen she sought to banish that painful thought by taking all the blame\r\nto herself, he had replied:\r\n\r\n"No, my poor Indiana, do not accuse yourself; you have no idea how\r\nguilty I am."\r\n\r\nThose words, uttered in a bitter, gloomy tone, had alarmed Madame\r\nDelmare. She had not dared to insist, and, now that she was beginning to\r\nunderstand all these fragments of discoveries, she had not the courage\r\nto fix her thoughts upon them and put them together.\r\n\r\nShe opened her window, and, as she looked out upon the calm night, upon\r\nthe moon so pale and lovely behind the silvery vapors on the horizon, as\r\nshe remembered that Raymon was coming, that he was perhaps in the park\r\neven now, and thought of all the joy she had anticipated in that hour of\r\nlove and mystery, she cursed Ralph who with a word had poisoned her hope\r\nand destroyed her repose forever. She even felt that she hated him, the\r\nunhappy man who had been a father to her and who had sacrificed his\r\nfuture for her; for his future was Indiana\'s friendship; that was his\r\nonly treasure, and he resigned himself to the certainty of forfeiting it\r\nin order to save her.\r\n\r\nIndiana could not read in the depths of his heart, nor had she been able\r\nto fathom Raymon\'s. She was unjust, not from ingratitude, but from\r\nignorance. Being under the influence of a strong passion she could not\r\nbut feel strongly the blow that had been dealt her. For an instant she\r\nlaid the whole crime upon Ralph, preferring to accuse him rather than to\r\nsuspect Raymon.\r\n\r\nAnd then she had so little time to collect her thoughts, and make up her\r\nmind: Raymon was coming. Perhaps it was he whom she had seen for some\r\nminutes wandering about the little bridge. How much more intense would\r\nher aversion for Ralph have been at that moment, if she could have\r\nrecognized him in that vague figure, which constantly appeared and\r\ndisappeared in the mist, and which, like a spirit stationed at the gate\r\nof the Elysian Fields, sought to keep the guilty man from entering!\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came to her mind one of those strange, half-formed ideas,\r\nwhich only restless and unhappy persons are capable of conceiving. She\r\nrisked her whole destiny upon a strange and delicate test against which\r\nRaymon could not be on his guard. She had hardly completed her\r\nmysterious preparations when she heard Raymon\'s footsteps on the secret\r\nstairway. She ran and unlocked the door, then returned to her chair, so\r\nagitated that she felt that she was on the point of falling; but, as in\r\nall the great crises of her life, she retained a remarkable clearness of\r\nperception and great strength of mind.\r\n\r\nRaymon was still pale and breathless when he opened the door; impatient\r\nto see the light, to grasp reality once more. Indiana\'s back was turned\r\nto him, she was wrapped in a fur-lined pelisse. By a strange chance it\r\nwas the same that Noun wore when she went to meet him in the park at\r\ntheir last rendezvous. I do not know if you remember that at that time\r\nRaymon had had for an instant the untenable idea that that woman\r\nshrouded in her cloak was Madame Delmare. Now, when he saw once more the\r\nsame apparition sitting inert in a chair, with her head on her breast,\r\nby the light of a pale, flickering lamp, on the same spot where so many\r\nmemories awaited him, in that room which he had not entered since the\r\ndarkest night in his life and which was full to overflowing of his\r\nremorse, he involuntarily recoiled and remained in the doorway, his\r\nterrified gaze fixed upon that motionless figure, and trembling like a\r\ncoward, lest, when it turned, it should display the livid features of a\r\ndrowned woman.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare had no suspicion of the effect she produced upon Raymon.\r\nShe had wound about her head a handkerchief of India silk, tied\r\ncarelessly in true creole style; it was Noun\'s usual head-dress. Raymon,\r\nfairly overcome by terror, nearly fell backward, thinking that his\r\nsuperstitious fancies were realized. But, recognizing the woman he had\r\ncome to seduce, he forgot the one whom he had seduced and walked toward\r\nher. Her face wore a grave, meditative expression: she gazed earnestly\r\nat him, but with close attention rather than affection, and did not make\r\na motion to draw him to her side more quickly.\r\n\r\nRaymon, surprised by this reception, attributed it to some scruple of\r\nchastity, to some girlish impulse of delicacy or constraint. He knelt at\r\nher feet, saying:\r\n\r\n"Are you afraid of me, my beloved?" But at that moment he noticed that\r\nMadame Delmare held something in her hands to which she seemed to direct\r\nhis attention with a playful affectation of gravity. He looked more\r\nclosely and saw a mass of black hair, of varying lengths, which seemed\r\nto have been cut in haste, and which Indiana was smoothing with her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"Do you recognize it?" she asked, fastening upon him her limpid eyes, in\r\nwhich there was a peculiar, penetrating gleam.\r\n\r\nRaymon hesitated, looked again at the handkerchief about her head, and\r\nthought that he understood.\r\n\r\n"Naughty girl!" he said, taking the hair in his hand, "why did you cut\r\nit off? It was so beautiful, and I loved it so dearly!"\r\n\r\n"You asked me yesterday," she said with the shadow of a smile, "if I\r\nwould sacrifice it to you."\r\n\r\n"O Indiana!" cried Raymon, "you know well that you will be lovelier than\r\never to me henceforth. Give it to me. I do not choose to regret the\r\nabsence from your head of that glorious hair which I admired every day,\r\nand which now I can kiss every day without restraint. Give it to me, so\r\nthat it may never leave me."\r\n\r\nBut as he gathered up in his hand that luxuriant mass of which some\r\nlocks reached to the floor, Raymon fancied that it had a dry, rough\r\nfeeling which his fingers had never noticed in the silken tresses over\r\nIndiana\'s forehead. He was conscious, also, of an indefinable nervous\r\nthrill, it felt so cold and dead, as if it had been cut a long time, and\r\nseemed to have lost its perfumed moisture and vital warmth. Then he\r\nlooked at it again, and sought in vain the blue gleam which made\r\nIndiana\'s hair resemble the blue-black wing of the crow; this was of an\r\nEthiopian black, of an Indian texture, of a lifeless heaviness.\r\n\r\nIndiana\'s bright piercing eyes followed Raymon\'s. He turned them\r\ninvoluntarily upon an open ebony casket from which several locks of the\r\nsame hair protruded.\r\n\r\n"This is not yours," he said, untying the kerchief which concealed\r\nMadame Delmare\'s hair.\r\n\r\nIt was untouched, and fell over her shoulders in all its splendor. But\r\nshe made a gesture as if to push him away and said, still pointing to\r\nthe hair:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you recognize this? Did you never admire, never caress it? Has\r\nthe damp night air robbed it of all its fragrance? Have you not a\r\nthought, a tear for her who wore this ring?"\r\n\r\nRaymon sank upon a chair; Noun\'s locks fell from his trembling hand. So\r\nmuch painful excitement had exhausted him. He was a man of choleric\r\ntemper, whose blood flowed rapidly, whose nerves were easily and deeply\r\nirritated. He shivered from head to foot and fell in a swoon on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to himself, Madame Delmare was on her knees beside him,\r\nweeping copiously and asking his forgiveness; but Raymon no longer loved\r\nher.\r\n\r\n"You have inflicted a horrible wound on me," he said; "a wound which it\r\nis not in your power to cure. You will never restore the confidence I\r\nhad in your heart; that is evident to me. You have shown me how\r\nvindictive and cruel your heart can be. Poor Noun! poor unhappy girl! It\r\nwas she whom I treated badly, not you; it was she who had the right to\r\navenge herself, and she did not. She took her own life in order to leave\r\nme the future. She sacrificed herself to my repose. You are not the\r\nwoman to have done as much, madame! Give me her hair; it is mine--it\r\nbelongs to me; it is all that remains to me of the only woman who ever\r\nloved me truly. Unhappy Noun! you were worthy of a better love! And you,\r\nmadame, dare to reproach me with her death; you, whom I loved so well\r\nthat I forgot her--that I defied the ghastly torture of remorse; you\r\nwho, on the faith of a kiss, have led me across that river--across that\r\nbridge--alone, with terror at my side, pursued by the infernal illusions\r\nof my crime! And when you discover with what a frantic passion I love\r\nyou, you bury your woman\'s nails in my heart, seeking there another drop\r\nof blood which may still be made to flow for you! Ah! when I spurned so\r\ndevoted a love to take up with so savage a passion as yours, I was no\r\nless mad than guilty."\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare did not reply. Pale and motionless, with dishevelled hair\r\nand staring eyes, she moved Raymon to pity. He took her hand.\r\n\r\n"And yet," he said, "this love I feel for you is so blind that, in spite\r\nof myself, I can still forget the past and the present--the sin that\r\nblasted my life and the crime you have just committed. So love me, and I\r\nwill forgive you."\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare\'s despair rekindled desire and pride in her lover\'s\r\nheart. When he saw how dismayed she was at the thought of losing his\r\nlove--how humble before him, how resigned to accept his decrees for the\r\nfuture by way of atonement for the past--he remembered what his\r\nintentions had been when he eluded Ralph\'s vigilance, and he realized\r\nall the advantages of his position. He pretended to be absorbed in a\r\nmelancholy, sombre reverie for some moments; he hardly responded to\r\nIndiana\'s tears and caresses. He waited until her heart should break and\r\noverflow in sobs, until she should realize all the horrors of\r\ndesertion--until she should have exhausted all her strength in\r\nheart-rending emotion; and then, when he saw her at his feet, fainting,\r\nutterly worn out, awaiting death at a word from him, he seized her in\r\nhis arms with convulsive passion and strained her to his heart. She\r\nyielded like a weak child; she abandoned her lips to him unresistingly.\r\nShe was almost dead.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, as if waking from a dream, she snatched herself away from\r\nhis burning caresses, rushed to the end of the room where Sir Ralph\'s\r\nportrait hung on the panel; and, as if she would place herself under the\r\nprotection of that grave personage with the unruffled brow and tranquil\r\nlips, she shrank back against the portrait, wild-eyed, quivering from\r\nhead to foot, in the clutches of a strange fear. It was this that made\r\nRaymon think that she had been deeply moved in his arms--that she was\r\nafraid of herself--that she was his. He ran to her; drew her by force\r\nfrom her retreat, and told her that he had come with the purpose of\r\nkeeping his promises, but that her cruel treatment of him had absolved\r\nhim from his oath.\r\n\r\n"I am no longer either your slave or your ally," he said. "I am simply\r\nthe man who loves you madly and who has you in his arms, a wicked,\r\ncapricious, cruel, mad creature, but lovely and adored. With sweet,\r\nconfiding words you might have cooled my blood. Had you been as calm and\r\ngenerous as yesterday, you would have made me mild and submissive as\r\nusual. But you have kindled all my passions, overturned all my ideas.\r\nYou have made me unhappy, cowardly, ill, frantic, desperate, one after\r\nanother. You must make me happy now, or I feel that I can no longer\r\nbelieve in you--that I can no longer love you or bless you. Forgive me,\r\nIndiana, forgive me! If I frighten you it is your own fault; you have\r\nmade me suffer so that I have lost my reason!"\r\n\r\nIndiana trembled in every limb. She knew so little of life that she\r\nbelieved resistance to be impossible; she was ready to concede from fear\r\nwhat she would refuse from love; but, as she struggled feebly in\r\nRaymon\'s arms, she said, in desperation:\r\n\r\n"So you are capable of using force with me?"\r\n\r\nRaymon paused, impressed with this moral resistance, which survived\r\nphysical resistance. He hastily pushed her away.\r\n\r\n"Never!" he cried: "I would rather die than possess you except by your\r\nown will!"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself on his knees, and all that the mind can supply in place\r\nof the heart, all the poesy that the imagination can impart to the ardor\r\nof the blood, he expressed in a fervent and dangerous entreaty. And when\r\nhe saw that she did not surrender, he yielded to necessity and\r\nreproached her with not loving him; a commonplace expedient which he\r\ndespised and which made him smile, with a feeling of something like\r\nshame at having to do with a woman so innocent as not to smile at it\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThat reproach went to Indiana\'s heart more swiftly than all the\r\nexclamations with which Raymon had embellished his discourse.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly she remembered.\r\n\r\n"Raymon," she said, "the other, who loved you so dearly--of whom we were\r\nspeaking just now--she refused you nothing, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing!" exclaimed Raymon, annoyed by this inopportune reminder.\r\n"Instead of reminding me of her so continually, you would do well to\r\nmake me forget how dearly she loved me!"\r\n\r\n"Listen!" rejoined Indiana, thoughtfully and gravely; "have a little\r\ncourage, for I must say something more. Perhaps you have not been as\r\nguilty towards me as I thought. It would be sweet to me to be able to\r\nforgive you for what I considered a mortal insult. Tell me then--when I\r\nsurprised you here--for whom did you come? for her or for me?"\r\n\r\nRaymon hesitated; then, as he thought that the truth would soon be known\r\nto Madame Delmare, that perhaps she knew it already, he answered:\r\n\r\n"For her."\r\n\r\n"Well, I prefer it so," she said sadly; "I prefer an infidelity to an\r\ninsult. Be frank to the end, Raymon. How long had you been in my room\r\nwhen I came? Remember that Ralph knows all, and that, if I chose to\r\nquestion him----"\r\n\r\n"There is no need of Sir Ralph\'s testimony, madame. I had been here\r\nsince the night before."\r\n\r\n"And you had passed the night in this room. Your silence is a sufficient\r\nanswer."\r\n\r\nThey both remained silent for some moments; then Indiana rose and was\r\nabout to continue, when a sharp knock at the door checked the flow of\r\nthe blood in her veins. Neither she nor Raymon dared to breathe.\r\n\r\nA paper was slipped under the door. It was a leaf from a note-book on\r\nwhich these words were scrawled in pencil, almost illegibly:\r\n\r\n"Your husband is here.\r\n\r\n"RALPH."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n"This is a wretchedly devised falsehood," said Raymon, as soon as the\r\nsound of Ralph\'s footsteps had died away. "Sir Ralph needs a lesson, and\r\nI will administer it in such shape----"\r\n\r\n"I forbid it," said Indiana, in a cold, determined tone: "my husband is\r\nhere: Ralph never lied. You and I are lost. There was a time when the\r\nthought would have frozen me with horror; to-day it matters little to\r\nme!"\r\n\r\n"Very well!" said Raymon, seizing her in his arms excitedly, "since\r\ndeath encompasses us, be mine! Forgive everything, and let your last\r\nword in this supreme moment be a word of love, my last breath a breath\r\nof joy."\r\n\r\n"This moment of terror and courage might have been the sweetest moment\r\nin my life," she said, "but you have spoiled it for me."\r\n\r\nThere was a rumbling of wheels in the farmyard, and the bell at the gate\r\nof the ch\xc3\xa2teau was rung by a strong and impatient hand.\r\n\r\n"I know that ring," said Indiana, watchful and cool. "Ralph did not lie;\r\nbut you have time to escape; go!"\r\n\r\n"I will not," cried Raymon; "I suspect some despicable treachery and you\r\nshall not be the only victim. I will remain and my breast shall protect\r\nyou----"\r\n\r\n"There is no treachery--listen--the servants are stirring and the gate\r\nwill be opened directly. Go: the trees in the garden will conceal you,\r\nand the moon is not fairly out yet. Not a word more, but go!"\r\n\r\nRaymon was compelled to obey; but she accompanied him to the foot of the\r\nstairs and cast a searching glance about the flower-garden. All was\r\nsilent and calm. She stood a long while on the last stair, listening\r\nwith terror to the grinding of his footsteps on the gravel, entirely\r\noblivious of her husband\'s arrival. What cared she for his suspicions\r\nand his anger, provided that Raymon was out of danger?\r\n\r\nAs for him he crossed the stream and hurried swiftly through the park.\r\nHe reached the small gate and, in his excitement, had some difficulty in\r\nopening it. He was no sooner in the road than Sir Ralph appeared in\r\nfront of him and said with as much _sang-froid_ as if he were accosting\r\nhim at a party:\r\n\r\n"Be good enough to let me have that key. If there should be a search for\r\nit, it would be less inconvenient for it to be found in my hands."\r\n\r\nRaymon would have preferred the most deadly insult to this satirical\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\n"I am not the man to forget a well-meant service," said he; "I am the\r\nman to avenge an insult and to punish treachery."\r\n\r\nSir Ralph changed neither his tone nor his expression.\r\n\r\n"I want none of your gratitude," he rejoined, "and I await your\r\nvengeance tranquilly; but this is no time to talk. There is your\r\npath--think of Madame Delmare\'s good name."\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis night of agitation had overturned Raymon\'s brain so completely that\r\nhe would readily have believed in witchcraft at that moment. He reached\r\nCercy at daybreak and went to bed with a raging fever.\r\n\r\nAs for Madame Delmare, she did the honors of the breakfast table for her\r\nhusband and cousin with much calmness and dignity. She had not as yet\r\nreflected upon her situation; she was absolutely under the influence of\r\ninstinct, which enjoined _sang-froid_ and presence of mind upon her. The\r\ncolonel was gloomy and thoughtful, but it was his business alone that\r\npreoccupied him, and no jealous suspicion found a place in his thoughts.\r\n\r\nToward evening Raymon mustered courage to think about his love; but that\r\nlove had diminished materially. He loved obstacles; but he hated to be\r\nbored and he foresaw that he should be bored times without number now\r\nthat Indiana had the right to reproach him. However, he remembered at\r\nlast that his honor demanded that he should inquire for her, and he sent\r\nhis servant to prowl around Lagny and find out what was going on there.\r\nThe servant brought him the following letter which Madame Delmare\r\nherself had handed him:\r\n\r\n"I hoped last night that I should lose either my reason or my life.\r\nUnhappily for me I have retained both; but I will not complain, I have\r\ndeserved the suffering that I am undergoing; I chose to live this\r\ntempestuous life; it would be cowardly to recoil to-day. I do not know\r\nwhether you are guilty, I do not want to know. We will never return to\r\nthat subject, will we? It causes us both too much suffering: so let this\r\nbe the last time it is mentioned between us.\r\n\r\n"You said one thing at which I felt a cruel joy. Poor Noun! from your\r\nplace in heaven forgive me! you no longer suffer, you no longer love,\r\nperhaps you pity me! You told me, Raymon, that you sacrificed that\r\nunhappy girl to me, that you loved me better than her. Oh! do not take\r\nit back; you said it, and I feel so strongly the need to believe it that\r\nI do believe it. And yet your conduct last night, your entreaties, your\r\nwild outbreaks, might well have made me doubt it. I forgave you on\r\naccount of the mental disturbance under which you were laboring; but now\r\nyou have had time to reflect, to become yourself once more; tell me,\r\nwill you renounce loving me in that way? I, who love you with my heart,\r\nhave believed hitherto that I could arouse in you a love as pure as my\r\nown. And then I had not thought very much about the future; I had not\r\nlooked ahead very far, and I had not taken alarm at the thought that the\r\nday might come when, conquered by your devotion, I should sacrifice to\r\nyou my scruples and my repugnance. But to-day, it can no longer be the\r\nsame; I can see in the future only a ghastly parallel between myself and\r\nNoun! Oh! the thought of being loved no more than she was! If I believed\r\nit! And yet she was lovelier than I, far lovelier! Why did you prefer\r\nme? You must have loved me differently and better.--That is what I\r\nwanted you to say. Will you give up being my lover in the way that you\r\nhave been? In that case I can still esteem you, believe in your remorse,\r\nyour sincerity, your love; if not, think of me no more, you will never\r\nsee me again. I shall die of it perhaps, but I would rather die than\r\ndescend so low as to be your mistress."\r\n\r\nRaymon was sorely embarrassed as to how he should reply. This pride\r\noffended him; he had never supposed hitherto that a woman who had thrown\r\nherself into his arms could resist him thus outspokenly and give reasons\r\nfor her resistance.\r\n\r\n"She does not love me," he said to himself; "her heart is dry, she is\r\nnaturally overbearing."\r\n\r\nFrom that moment he loved her no longer. She had ruffled his\r\nself-esteem; she had disappointed his hope of triumph, defeated his\r\nanticipations of pleasure. In his eyes she was no more than Noun had\r\nbeen. Poor Indiana! who longed to be so much more! Her passionate love\r\nwas misunderstood, her blind confidence was spurned. Raymon had never\r\nunderstood her; how could he have continued to love her?\r\n\r\nThereupon he swore, in his irritation, that he would triumph over her;\r\nhe swore it not from a feeling of pride but in a revengeful spirit. It\r\nwas no longer a matter of snatching a new pleasure, but of punishing an\r\ninsult; of possessing a woman, but of subduing her. He swore that he\r\nwould be her master, were it for but a single day, and that then he\r\nwould abandon her, to have the satisfaction of seeing her at his feet.\r\n\r\nOn the spur of the moment he wrote this letter:\r\n\r\n"You want me to promise. Foolish girl, can you think of such a thing? I\r\nwill promise whatever you choose, because I can do nothing but obey you;\r\nbut, if I break my promises I shall be guilty neither to God nor to you.\r\nIf you loved me, Indiana, you would not inflict these cruel torments on\r\nme, you would not expose me to the risk of perjuring myself, you would\r\nnot blush at the thought of being my mistress. But you think that in my\r\narms you would be degraded----"\r\n\r\nHe felt that his bitterness was making itself manifest, despite his\r\nefforts; he tore up this sheet, and, after taking time to reflect, began\r\nanew:\r\n\r\n"You admit that you nearly lost your reason last night; for my part, I\r\nlost mine altogether. I was culpable--but no, I was mad! Forget those\r\nhours of suffering and excitement. I am calm now; I have reflected; I am\r\nstill worthy of you. Bless you, my angel from heaven, for saving me from\r\nmyself, for reminding me how I ought to love you. Now, Indiana, command\r\nme! I am your slave, as you well know. I would give my life for an hour\r\nin your arms; but I can suffer a whole lifetime to obtain a smile from\r\nyou. I will be your friend, your brother, nothing more. If I suffer, you\r\nshall not know it. If my blood boils when I am near you, if my breast\r\ntakes fire, if a cloud passes before my eyes when I touch your hand, if\r\na sweet kiss from your lips, a sisterly kiss, scorches my forehead, I\r\nwill order my blood to be calm, my brain to grow cool, my mouth to\r\nrespect you. I will be gentle, I will be submissive, I will be\r\nunhappy,--if you will be the happier therefor and enjoy my agony,--if\r\nonly I may hear you tell me again that you love me! Oh! tell me so! give\r\nme back your confidence and my joy! tell me when we shall meet again. I\r\nknow not what result the events of last night may have had; how does it\r\nhappen that you do not refer to the subject, that you leave me in an\r\nagony of suspense? Carle saw you all three walking together in the park.\r\nThe colonel seemed ill or depressed, but not angry. In that case that\r\nRalph did not betray us! What a strange man! But to what extent can we\r\nrely on his discretion; and how shall I dare show myself at Lagny now\r\nthat our fate is in his hands? But I will dare. If it is necessary to\r\nstoop so low as to implore him, I will silence my pride, I will overcome\r\nmy aversion, I will do anything rather than lose you. A word from you\r\nand I will burden my life with as much remorse as I am able to carry;\r\nfor you I would abandon my mother herself; for you I would commit any\r\ncrime. Ah! if you realized the depth of my love, Indiana!"\r\n\r\nThe pen fell from Raymon\'s hands; he was terribly fatigued, he was\r\nfalling asleep. But he read over his letter to make sure that his ideas\r\nhad not suffered from the influence of drowsiness; but it was impossible\r\nfor him to understand his own meaning, his brain was so affected by his\r\nphysical exhaustion. He rang for his servant, bade him go to Lagny\r\nbefore daybreak; then slept that deep, refreshing sleep whose tranquil\r\ndelights only those who are thoroughly satisfied with themselves really\r\nknow. Madame Delmare had not retired; she was unconscious of fatigue and\r\npassed the night writing. When she received Raymon\'s letter she answered\r\nit in haste:\r\n\r\n"Thanks, Raymon, thanks! you restore my strength and my life. Now I can\r\ndare anything, endure anything; for you love me, and the most severe\r\ntests do not alarm you. Yes, we will meet again--we will defy everybody.\r\nRalph may do what he will with our secret. I am no longer disturbed\r\nabout anything since you love me; I am not even afraid of my husband.\r\n\r\n"You want to know about our affairs? I forgot to mention them yesterday,\r\nand yet they have taken a turn which has an important bearing on my\r\nfortunes. We are ruined. There is some talk of selling Lagny, and even\r\nof going to live in the colonies. But of what consequence is all that? I\r\ncannot make up my mind to think about it. I know that we shall never be\r\nparted. You have sworn it, Raymon; I rely on your promise, do you rely\r\non my courage. Nothing will frighten me, nothing will turn me back. My\r\nplace is established at your side, and death alone can tear me from it."\r\n\r\n"Mere woman\'s effervescence!" said Raymon, crumpling the letter.\r\n"Romantic projects, perilous undertakings, appeal to their feeble\r\nimaginations as bitter substances arouse a sick man\'s appetite. I have\r\nsucceeded; I have recovered my influence; and, as for all this imprudent\r\nfolly with which she threatens me, we will see! It is all characteristic\r\nof the light-headed, false creatures, always ready to undertake the\r\nimpossible and making of generosity a show virtue which must be attended\r\nwith scandal! Who would think, to read this letter, that she counts her\r\nkisses and doles out her caresses like a miser!"\r\n\r\nThat same day he went to Lagny. Ralph was not there, and the colonel\r\nreceived him amicably and talked to him confidentially. He took him into\r\nthe park, where they were less likely to be disturbed, and told him that\r\nhe was utterly ruined and that the factory would be offered for sale on\r\nthe following day. Raymon made generous offers of assistance, but\r\nDelmare declined them.\r\n\r\n"No, my friend," he said, "I have suffered too much from the thought\r\nthat I owed my fate to Ralph\'s kindness; I was in too much of a hurry to\r\nrepay him. The sale of this property will enable me to pay all my debts\r\nat once. To be sure, I shall have nothing left, but I have courage,\r\nenergy and business experience; the future is before us. I have built up\r\nmy little fortune once, and I can begin it again. I must do it for my\r\nwife\'s sake, for she is young, and I don\'t wish to leave her in poverty.\r\nShe still owns an estate of some little value at Ile Bourbon, and I\r\npropose to go into retirement there and start in business afresh. In a\r\nfew years--in ten years at most--I hope that we shall meet again."\r\n\r\nRaymon pressed the colonel\'s hand, smiling inwardly at his confidence,\r\nat his speaking of ten years as of a single day, when his bald head and\r\nenfeebled body indicated a feeble hold upon existence, a life near its\r\nclose. Nevertheless he pretended to share his hopes.\r\n\r\n"I am delighted to see," he said, "that you do not allow yourself to be\r\ncast down by these reverses. I recognize your manly heart, your\r\nundaunted courage. But does Madame Delmare display the same courage? Do\r\nyou not anticipate some resistance on her part to your project of\r\nexpatriation?"\r\n\r\n"I shall be very sorry," the colonel replied, "but wives are made to\r\nobey, not to advise. I have not yet definitely made my purpose known to\r\nIndiana. With the exception of yourself, my friend, I do not know what\r\nthere is here that she should feel any regret at leaving; and yet I\r\nanticipate tears and nervous attacks, from a spirit of contradiction, if\r\nnothing else. The devil take the women! However, my dear Raymon, I rely\r\nupon you all the same to make my wife listen to reason. She has\r\nconfidence in you; use your influence to prevent her from crying. I\r\ndetest tears."\r\n\r\nRaymon promised to come again the next day and inform Madame Delmare of\r\nher husband\'s decision.\r\n\r\n"You will do me a very great favor," said the colonel. "I will take\r\nRalph to the farm, so that you may have a good chance to talk with her."\r\n\r\n"Well, luck is on my side!" thought Ralph, as he took his leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nMonsieur Delmare\'s plans fell in perfectly with Raymon\'s wishes. He\r\nforesaw that this love affair which, so far as he was concerned, was\r\ndrawing near its close, would soon bring him nothing but annoyance and\r\nimportunity, so that he was very glad to see events arranging themselves\r\nin such a way as to save him from the wearisome but inevitable results\r\nof a played-out intrigue. It only remained for him to take advantage of\r\nMadame Delmare\'s last moments of excitement, and then to leave to his\r\ncomplaisant destiny the task of ridding him of her tears and reproaches.\r\n\r\nSo he returned to Lagny the next day, intending to exalt the unhappy\r\nwoman\'s enthusiasm to its apogee.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, Indiana," he said, when they met, "the part that your\r\nhusband has requested me to play with respect to you? A strange\r\ncommission, upon my word! I am to entreat you to go with him to Ile\r\nBourbon; to urge you to leave me; to tear out my heart and my life. Do\r\nyou think that he made a good choice of an advocate?"\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare\'s sombre gravity imposed a sort of respect on Raymon\'s\r\ncunning.\r\n\r\n"Why do you come and tell me all this?" she said. "Are you afraid that I\r\nshall allow myself to be moved? Are you afraid that I shall obey? Never\r\nfear, Raymon, my mind is made up; I have passed two nights looking at it\r\non every side; I know to what I expose myself; I know what I must defy,\r\nwhat I must sacrifice, what I must disdain to notice; I am ready to pass\r\nthrough this stormy period of my destiny. Will not you be my support and\r\nmy guide?"\r\n\r\nRaymon was tempted to take fright at this cool determination and to take\r\nthese insane threats seriously; but in a moment he recurred to his\r\nformer opinion that Indiana did not really love him, and that she was\r\napplying now to her situation the exaggerated sentiments she had learned\r\nfrom books. He strove to be eloquent with passion, he devoted his\r\nenergies to dramatic improvisation, in order to maintain himself on his\r\nromantic mistress\'s level, and he succeeded in prolonging her error.\r\nBut, to a calm and impartial auditor, this love scene would have seemed\r\na contest between stage illusion and reality. The grandiloquence of\r\nRaymon\'s sentiments, the poesy of his ideas would have seemed a cold and\r\ncruel parody of the real sentiments which Indiana expressed so simply:\r\nin the one case mind, in the other heart.\r\n\r\nRaymon, who however had some little fear that she might carry out her\r\npromises if he did not shrewdly undermine the plan of resistance she had\r\nformed, persuaded her to counterfeit submission or indifference until\r\nsuch time as she could come forth in open rebellion. It was essential,\r\nhe said, that they should have left Lagny before she declared herself,\r\nin order to avoid a scandal in presence of the servants, and Ralph\'s\r\ndangerous intervention in the affair.\r\n\r\nBut Ralph did not leave his unfortunate friends. In vain did he offer\r\nhis whole fortune, his Bellerive estate, his English consols, and\r\nwhatever his plantations in the colonies would bring; the colonel was\r\ninflexible. His affection for Ralph had diminished; he was no longer\r\nwilling to owe anything to him. Ralph might perhaps have been able to\r\nmove him had he possessed Raymon\'s wit and address; but when he had\r\nplainly set forth his ideas and declared his sentiments, the poor\r\nbaronet believed that he had said everything, and he never attempted to\r\nsecure the retraction of a refusal. So he let Bellerive and followed\r\nMonsieur and Madame Delmare to Paris, pending their departure for Ile\r\nBourbon.\r\n\r\nLagny was offered for sale with the factory and the appurtenances. The\r\nwinter was a melancholy and depressing one to Madame Delmare. To be\r\nsure, Raymon was in Paris, he saw her every day, he was attentive and\r\naffectionate; but he remained barely an hour with her. He arrived just\r\nafter dinner, and when the colonel went out on business, he also took\r\nhis leave to attend some social function or other. Society, you know,\r\nwas Raymon\'s element, his life; he must have the noise, the bustle, the\r\ncrowd, to breathe freely, to display all his intellectual power, all his\r\nease of manner, all his superiority. In the privacy of the boudoir he\r\ncould make himself attractive, in society he became brilliant; and then\r\nhe was no longer the man of a small coterie, the friend of this one or\r\nthat one; he was the man of intellect who belongs to all alike, and to\r\nwhom society is a sort of fatherland.\r\n\r\nAnd then, as we have said, Raymon had some principle. When the colonel\r\nmanifested such confidence in him and esteem for him, when he saw that\r\nhe regarded him as the very type of honor and sincerity and desired him\r\nto act as mediator between his wife and himself, he determined to\r\njustify that confidence, to deserve that esteem, to reconcile that\r\nhusband and wife, to repel any attachment on the part of the latter\r\nwhich might endanger the repose of the other. He became once more a\r\nmoral, virtuous, philosophical person. You will see for how long.\r\n\r\nIndiana, who did not understand this conversion, suffered horribly to be\r\nso neglected; and yet she still had the satisfaction of feeling that her\r\nhopes were not entirely destroyed. She was easily deceived; she asked\r\nnothing better than to be deceived, her real life was so bitter and\r\ndesolate! Her husband had become almost impossible to live with. In\r\npublic he affected the heroic courage and indifference of a brave man;\r\nbut when he returned to the privacy of his own home he was simply an\r\nirritable, severe, absurd child. Indiana was the victim of his disgust\r\nwith life, and, we must confess, she was largely to blame. If she had\r\nraised her voice, if she had complained, affectionately but forcibly,\r\nDelmare, who was only rough, would have blushed at the idea of being\r\nconsidered unkind. Nothing was easier than to touch his heart and govern\r\nhim absolutely, if one chose to descend to his level and enter into the\r\ncircle of ideas that were within the scope of his mind. But Indiana was\r\nstiff and haughty in her submissiveness; she always obeyed in silence;\r\nbut it was the silence and submissiveness of the slave who has made of\r\nhatred a virtue and of unhappiness a merit. Her resignation was the\r\ndignity of a king who accepts fetters and a dungeon rather than\r\nvoluntarily abdicate his throne and lay aside a vain title. A woman of a\r\ncommoner mould would have mastered that commonplace man; she would have\r\nsaid what he said and reserved the right to think differently; she would\r\nhave pretended to respect his prejudices and secretly have trampled them\r\nunder foot; she would have caressed him and deceived him. Indiana saw\r\nmany women who acted thus; but she felt so far above them that she would\r\nhave blushed to imitate them. Being virtuous and chaste, she thought\r\nthat she was not called upon to flatter her master by her words so long\r\nas she respected him in his actions. She did not care for his affection\r\nbecause she could not respond to it. She would have considered it far\r\nmore blameworthy to make a show of love for the husband whom she did not\r\nlove, than to give her heart to the lover who inspired love in her. To\r\ndeceive was the crime in her eyes, and twenty times a day she felt that\r\nshe must declare her love for Raymon; naught detained her but the fear\r\nof ruining him. Her impassive obedience irritated the colonel much more\r\nthan a cleverly managed rebellion would have done. Although his\r\nself-esteem would have suffered if he had ceased to be master in his own\r\nhouse, it suffered much more from the consciousness that he was master\r\nin a hateful and absurd fashion. He would have liked to convince and he\r\nsimply commanded; to reign, and he governed. Sometimes he gave an order\r\nthat was awkwardly expressed, or, without reflection, issued orders that\r\nwere injurious to his own interests. Madame Delmare saw that they were\r\ncarried out without scrutiny, without question, with the indifference of\r\nthe horse that draws the plough in one direction or another. Delmare,\r\nwhen he saw the result of the failure to understand his ideas, of the\r\nmisconstruction of his wishes, would fly into a rage; but when she had\r\nproved to him with a few tranquil, icy words that she had simply caused\r\nhis orders to be obeyed, he was reduced to the necessity of turning his\r\nwrath against himself. It was a cruel pang, a bitter affront to that man\r\nof petty self-esteem and of violent passions.\r\n\r\nSeveral times he would have killed his wife, if he had been at Smyrna or\r\nat Cairo. And yet he loved with all his heart that weak woman who lived\r\nin subjection to him and kept the secret of his ill-treatment with\r\nreligious prudence. He loved her or pitied her--I do not know which. He\r\nwould have liked to win her love, for he was proud of her education and\r\nof her superiority. He would have risen in his own eyes if she would\r\nhave stooped so far as to parley with his ideas and his principles. When\r\nhe went to her apartments in the morning with the purpose of picking a\r\nquarrel with her, he sometimes found her asleep and dared not wake her.\r\nHe would gaze at her in silence; he would take fright at the delicacy of\r\nher constitution, the pallor of her cheeks, at the air of calm\r\nmelancholy, of resignation to misfortune expressed by that motionless\r\nand silent face. He would find in her features innumerable subjects of\r\nself-reproach, remorse, anger and dread. He would blush at the thought\r\nof the influence which so frail a creature had exerted over his\r\ndestiny--he, a man of iron, accustomed to command others, to see whole\r\nbattalions, spirited horses and frightened men march at a word from his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nAnd a wife who was still but a child had made him unhappy! She forced\r\nhim to look within himself--to scrutinize his own decisions, to modify\r\nmany of them, to retract some of them--and all this without saying: "You\r\nare wrong; I beg that you will do thus or thus." She had never implored,\r\nshe had never deigned to show herself his equal and to avow herself his\r\ncompanion. That woman, whom he could have crushed in his hand if he had\r\nchosen, lay there, an insignificant creature, dreaming of another before\r\nhis eyes, perhaps, and defying him even in her sleep. He was tempted to\r\nstrangle her--to drag her out of bed by the hair, to trample on her and\r\nforce her to shriek for mercy and to implore his forgiveness; but she\r\nwas so pretty, so dainty and so fair, that he would suddenly take pity\r\non her, as a child is moved to pity as he gazes at the bird he intended\r\nto kill. And he would weep like a woman, man of bronze as he was, and\r\nwould steal away so that she might not enjoy the triumph of seeing him\r\nweep. In truth I know not which was the unhappier, he or she. She was\r\ncruel from virtue, as he was kind from weakness; she had too much\r\npatience, of which he had not enough; she had the failings of her good\r\nqualities and he the good qualities of his failings.\r\n\r\nAround these two ill-assorted beings swarmed a multitude of friends who\r\nstrove to bring them nearer together, some in order to have something to\r\noccupy their minds, others to give themselves importance, others as the\r\nresult of ill-advised affection. Some took the wife\'s part, others the\r\nhusband\'s. They quarrelled among themselves on the subject of Monsieur\r\nand Madame Delmare, who, on the other hand, did not quarrel at all; for,\r\nwith Indiana\'s systematic submission, the colonel could never succeed in\r\npicking a quarrel, whatever he might do. And then there were those who\r\nknew nothing, but wanted to make themselves necessary. They counselled\r\nsubmission to Madame Delmare and did not see that she was only too\r\nsubmissive; others advised the husband to be inflexible and not to allow\r\nhis authority to pass into his wife\'s hands. These last, stupid mortals\r\nwho have so little feeling that they are always afraid that some one is\r\ntreading on them and who mistake cause and effect for each other, belong\r\nto a species which you will find everywhere, which is constantly getting\r\nentangled in other people\'s legs and makes a deal of noise in order to\r\nattract attention.\r\n\r\nMonsieur and Madame Delmare had made a particularly large number of\r\nacquaintances at Melun and at Fontainebleau. They met these people again\r\nat Paris, and they were the keenest in the game of evil-speaking that\r\nwas being played about them. The wit of small towns is, as you doubtless\r\nknow, the most ill-natured in the world. Good people are always\r\nmisunderstood there, superior minds are sworn foes of the public. If a\r\nbattle is to be fought for a fool or a boor you will see them running\r\nfrom all directions. If you have a dispute with any one, they come to\r\nlook on as at the theatre; they make bets; they crowd upon your heels,\r\nso eager are they to see and hear. The one who falls they will cover\r\nwith mud and maledictions; the weakest is always in the wrong. If you\r\nmake war on prejudices, petty foibles, vices, you insult them\r\npersonally, you attack them in what they hold most dear, you are a\r\ntreacherous and dangerous man. You will be summoned before the courts to\r\nmake reparation by people whose names you do not know, but whom you will\r\nbe convicted of having referred to in your slurring allusions. What\r\nadvice shall I give you? If you meet one of these people, avoid stepping\r\nin his shadow, even at sunset, when a man\'s shadow is thirty feet long;\r\nall that ground belongs to the inhabitant of the small town, and you\r\nhave no right to set foot upon it. If you breathe the air that he\r\nbreathes, you injure him, you destroy his health; if you drink at his\r\nfountain, you cause it to run dry; if you lend a hand to business in his\r\nprovince, you increase the price of the articles he purchases; if you\r\noffer him snuff, you poison it; if you think his daughter pretty, you\r\nintend to seduce her; if you extol his wife\'s domestic virtues, it is\r\ninsulting irony, and in your heart you despise her for her ignorance; if\r\nyou are so ill-advised as to pay him a compliment in his own house, he\r\nwill not understand it, and he will go about everywhere saying that you\r\nhave insulted him. Take your penates and carry them into the woods or to\r\nthe desolate moors. There only will the man of the small town leave you\r\nin peace.\r\n\r\nEven behind the manifold girdle of the walls of Paris the small town\r\npursued that ill-starred couple. Well-to-do families from Melun and\r\nFontainebleau took up their abode in the capital for the winter and\r\nbrought thither the blessing of their provincial manners. Cliques were\r\nformed around Delmare and his wife, and all that was humanly possible\r\nwas attempted in order to make their position with respect to each other\r\nmore uncomfortable. Their unhappiness was increased thereby and their\r\nmutual obstinacy did not diminish.\r\n\r\nRalph had the good sense not to meddle in their dissensions. Madame\r\nDelmare had suspected him of embittering her husband against her, or at\r\nleast of seeking to put an end to Raymon\'s intimacy with her; but she\r\nsoon realized the injustice of her suspicions. The colonel\'s perfect\r\ntranquillity with respect to Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re was irrefutable\r\nevidence of her cousin\'s silence. Thereupon she felt that she must thank\r\nhim; but he sedulously avoided any conversation on that subject;\r\nwhenever she was alone with him, he eluded her hints and pretended not\r\nto understand them. It was such a delicate subject that Madame Delmare\r\nhad not the courage to force Ralph to discuss it; she simply endeavored,\r\nby her loving attentions, by her delicate and affectionate deference to\r\nhim, to make him understand her gratitude; but Ralph seemed to pay no\r\nheed, and Indiana\'s pride was wounded by this display of supercilious\r\ngenerosity. She was afraid that she should seem to play the r\xc3\xb4le of the\r\nguilty wife imploring the indulgence of a stern witness; she became cold\r\nand constrained once more with poor Ralph. It seemed to her that his\r\nconduct in this matter was the natural consequence of his selfishness;\r\nthat he loved her still, although he no longer esteemed her; that he\r\nsimply desired her society for his own diversion, that he disliked to\r\nabandon habits which she had formed for him in her home and to deprive\r\nhimself of the attentions that she was never weary of bestowing upon\r\nhim. She fancied that he was by no means anxious to invent grievances\r\nagainst her husband or herself.\r\n\r\n"That is just like his contempt for women," she thought; "in his eyes\r\nthey are simply domestic animals, useful to keep a house in order,\r\nprepare meals and serve tea. He doesn\'t do them the honor of entering\r\ninto a discussion with them; their faults have no effect on him provided\r\nthat they do not interfere with his comfort or with his mode of life.\r\nRalph has no need of my heart; so long as my hands retain the knack of\r\npreparing his pudding and of touching the strings of the harp for him,\r\nwhat does he care for my love for another man, my secret suffering, my\r\ndeathly impatience under the yoke which is crushing me? I am his\r\nservant, he asks nothing more of me than that."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n\r\nIndiana had ceased to reproach Raymon; he defended himself so badly that\r\nshe was afraid of finding him too worthy of blame. There was one thing\r\nwhich she dreaded much more than being deceived, and that was being\r\nabandoned. She could not live without her belief in him, without her\r\nhope of the future he had promised her; for her life with Monsieur\r\nDelmare and Ralph had become hateful to her, and if she had not expected\r\nsoon to escape from the power of those two men, she would have drowned\r\nherself at once. She often thought of it; she said to herself that if\r\nRaymon treated her as he had treated Noun there would be no other way\r\nfor her to avoid an unendurable future than to join Noun. That sombre\r\nthought followed her everywhere and she took pleasure in it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the time fixed for their departure from France drew near. The\r\ncolonel seemed to have no suspicion of the resistance which his wife was\r\nmeditating; every day he made some progress in the settlement of his\r\naffairs, every day he paid off one more creditor; and Madame Delmare\r\nlooked on with a tranquil eye at all these preparations, sure as she was\r\nof her own courage. She was preparing, too, for her struggle with the\r\ndifficulties she anticipated. She sought to procure an ally in her aunt,\r\nMadame de Carvajal, and dilated to her upon her repugnance to the\r\njourney; and the old marchioness who--to give her no more than her\r\ndue--built great hopes of attracting _custom_ to her salon upon her\r\nniece\'s beauty, declared that it was the colonel\'s duty to leave his\r\nwife in France; that it would be downright barbarity to expose her to\r\nthe fatigues and dangers of an ocean voyage when her health had just\r\nbegun to show some slight improvement; in a word, that it was his place\r\nto go to work at rebuilding his fortune, Indiana\'s to remain with her\r\nold aunt and take care of her. At first Monsieur Delmare looked upon\r\nthese insinuations as the doting talk of an old woman; but he was forced\r\nto pay more attention to them when Madame de Carvajal gave him clearly\r\nto understand that her inheritance was to be had only at that price.\r\nAlthough Delmare loved money like a man who had worked hard all his life\r\nto amass it, he had some pride in his composition; he pronounced his\r\nultimatum with decision, and declared that his wife should go with him\r\nat any risk. The marchioness, who could not believe that money was not\r\nthe absolute sovereign of every man of good sense, did not look upon\r\nthis as Monsieur Delmare\'s last word; she continued to encourage her\r\nniece in her resistance, proposing to assume the responsibility for her\r\naction in the eyes of the world. It needed all the indelicacy of a mind\r\ncorrupted by intrigue and ambition, all the shuffling of a heart\r\ndistorted by constant devotion to mere external show, to close her eyes\r\nthus to the real causes of Indiana\'s rebellion. Her passion for Monsieur\r\nde Rami\xc3\xa8re was a secret to no one but her husband; but as Indiana had\r\nas yet given scandal nothing to seize upon, the secret was mentioned\r\nonly in undertones, and Madame de Carvajal had been confidentially\r\ninformed of it by more than a score of persons. The foolish old woman\r\nwas flattered by it; all that she desired was to have her niece _\xc3\xa0 la\r\nmode_ in society, and an intrigue with Raymon was a fine beginning. And\r\nyet Madame de Carvajal\'s moral character was not of the Regency type;\r\nthe Restoration had given a virtuous impulse to minds of that stamp; and\r\nas _conduct_ was demanded at court, the marchioness detested nothing so\r\nmuch as the scandal that ruins and destroys. Under Madame du Barry she\r\nwould have been less rigid in her principles; under the Dauphiness she\r\nbecame one of the _high-necked._ But all this was for show, for the sake\r\nof appearances; she kept her disapprobation and her scorn for notorious\r\nmisconduct, and she always awaited the result of an intrigue before\r\ncondemning it. Those infidelities which did not cross the threshold were\r\nvenial in her eyes. She became a Spaniard once more to pass judgment on\r\npassions inside the blinds; in her eyes there was no guilt save that\r\nwhich was placarded in the streets for passers-by to see. So that\r\nIndiana, passionate but chaste, enamored but reserved, was a precious\r\nsubject to exhibit and exploit; such a woman as she was might fascinate\r\nthe strongest brains in that hypocritical society and withstand the\r\nperils of the most delicate missions. There was an excellent chance to\r\nspeculate on the responsibility of so pure a mind and so passionate a\r\nheart. Poor Indiana! luckily her fatal destiny surpassed all her hopes\r\nand led her into an abyss of misery where her aunt\'s pernicious\r\nprotection did not seek her out.\r\n\r\nRaymon was not disturbed as to what was to become of her. This intrigue\r\nhad already reached the last stage of distaste, deathly ennui, so far as\r\nhe was concerned. To cause ennui is to descend as low as possible in the\r\nregard of the person whom one loves. Luckily for the last days of her\r\nillusion, Indiana had no suspicion of it.\r\n\r\nOne morning, on returning from a ball, he found Madame Delmare in his\r\nroom. She had come at midnight; for five mortal hours she had been\r\nwaiting! It was in the coldest part of the year; she had no fire, but\r\nsat with her head resting on her hand, enduring cold and anxiety with\r\nthe gloomy patience which the whole course of her life had taught her.\r\nShe raised her head when he entered, and Raymon, speechless with\r\namazement, could detect on her pale face no indication of anger or\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n"I was waiting for you," she said gently; "as you had not come to see me\r\nfor three days, and as things have happened which it is important that\r\nyou should know without delay, I came here last night in order to tell\r\nyou of them."\r\n\r\n"It is imprudent beyond belief!" said Raymon, cautiously locking the\r\ndoor behind him; "and my people know that you are here! They just told\r\nme so."\r\n\r\n"I made no attempt at concealment," she replied coldly; "and as for the\r\nword you use, I consider it ill-chosen."\r\n\r\n"I said imprudent, I should have said insane."\r\n\r\n"And I should say _courageous._ But no matter; listen to me. Monsieur\r\nDelmare starts for Bordeaux in three days, and sails thence for the\r\ncolony. You and I agreed that you should protect me from violence if he\r\nemployed it; there is no question that he will, for I made known my\r\ndetermination last evening and he locked me into my room. I escaped\r\nthrough a window; see, my hands are bleeding. They may be looking for me\r\nat this moment, but Ralph is at Bellerive so that he will not be able to\r\ntell where I am. I have decided to remain in hiding until Monsieur\r\nDelmare has made up his mind to leave me behind. Have you thought about\r\nmaking ready for my flight, of preparing a hiding-place for me? It is so\r\nlong since I have been able to see you alone, that I do not know what\r\nyour present inclinations are; but one day, when I expressed some doubt\r\nconcerning your resolution, you told me that you could not imagine love\r\nwithout confidence; you reminded me that you had never doubted me, you\r\nproved to me that I was unjust, and thereupon I was afraid of remaining\r\nbelow your level if I did not cast aside such puerile suspicions and the\r\ninnumerable little exactions by which women degrade ordinary\r\nlove-affairs. I have endured with resignation the brevity of your calls,\r\nthe embarrassment of our interviews, the eagerness with which you seemed\r\nto avoid any free exchange of sentiments with me; I have retained my\r\nconfidence in you. Heaven is my witness that when anxiety and fear were\r\ngnawing at my heart I spurned them as criminal thoughts. I have come now\r\nto seek the reward of my faith; the time has come; tell me, do you\r\naccept my sacrifices?"\r\n\r\nThe crisis was so urgent that Raymon did not feel bold enough to pretend\r\nany longer. Desperate, frantic to find himself caught in his own trap,\r\nhe lost his head and vented his temper in coarse and brutal\r\nmaledictions.\r\n\r\n"You are a mad woman!" he cried, throwing himself into a chair. "Where\r\nhave you dreamed of love? in what romance written for the entertainment\r\nof lady\'s-maids, have you studied society, I pray to know?"\r\n\r\nHe paused, realizing that he had been far too rough, and cudgelling his\r\nbrains to find a way of saying the same things in other terms and of\r\nsending her away without insulting her.\r\n\r\nBut she was calm, like one prepared to listen to anything.\r\n\r\n"Go on," she said, folding her arms over her heart, whose throbbing\r\ngradually grew less violent; "I am listening; I presume that you have\r\nsomething more than that to say to me?"\r\n\r\n"Still another effort of the imagination, another love scene," thought\r\nRaymon.--"Never," he cried, springing excitedly to his feet, "never will\r\nI accept such sacrifices! When I told you that I should have the\r\nstrength to do it, Indiana, I boasted too much, or rather I slandered\r\nmyself; for the man is no better than a dastard who will consent to\r\ndishonor the woman he loves. In your ignorance of life, you failed to\r\nrealize the importance of such a plan, and I, in my despair at the\r\nthought of losing you, did not choose to reflect----"\r\n\r\n"Your power of reflection has returned very suddenly!" she said,\r\nwithdrawing her hand, which he tried to take.\r\n\r\n"Indiana," he rejoined, "do you not see that you impose the dishonorable\r\npart on me, while you reserve the heroic part for yourself, and that you\r\ncondemn me because I desire to remain worthy of your love? Could you\r\ncontinue to love me, ignorant and simple-hearted woman that you are, if\r\nI sacrificed your life to my pleasure, your reputation to my selfish\r\ninterests?"\r\n\r\n"You say things that are very contradictory," said Indiana; "if I made\r\nyou happy by remaining with you, what do you care for public opinion? Do\r\nyou care more for it than for me?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! I do not care for it on my account, Indiana!"\r\n\r\n"Is it on my account then? I anticipated your scruples and to spare you\r\nanything like remorse I have taken the initiative; I did not wait for\r\nyou to come and carry me away from my home, I did not even consult you\r\nwith regard to crossing my husband\'s threshold forever. That decisive\r\nstep is taken, and your conscience cannot reproach you for it. At this\r\nmoment, Raymon, I am dishonored. In your absence I counted on yonder\r\nclock the hours that consummated my disgrace; and now, although the dawn\r\nfinds my brow as pure as it was yesterday, I am a lost creature in\r\npublic opinion. Yesterday there was still some compassion for me in the\r\nhearts of other women; to-day there will be no feeling left but\r\ncontempt. I considered all these things before acting."\r\n\r\n"Infernal female foresight!" thought Raymon.\r\n\r\nAnd then, struggling against her as he would have done against a bailiff\r\nwho had come to levy on his furniture, he said in a caressing fatherly\r\ntone:\r\n\r\n"You exaggerate the importance of what you have done. No, my love, all\r\nis not lost because of one rash step. I will enjoin silence on my\r\nservants."\r\n\r\n"Will you enjoin silence on mine who, I doubt not, are anxiously looking\r\nfor me at this moment. And my husband, do you think he will quietly keep\r\nthe secret? do you think he will consent to receive me to-morrow, when I\r\nhave passed a whole night under your roof? Will you advise me to go back\r\nand throw myself at his feet, and ask him, as a proof of his\r\nforgiveness, to be kind enough to replace on my neck the chain which has\r\ncrushed my life and withered my youth? You would consent, without\r\nregret, to see the woman whom you loved so dearly go back and resume\r\nanother man\'s yoke, when you have her fate in your hands, when you can\r\nkeep her in your arms all your life, when she is in your power, offering\r\nto remain there forever! You would not feel the least repugnance, the\r\nleast alarm in surrendering her at once to the implacable master, who\r\nperhaps awaits her coming only to kill her!"\r\n\r\nA thought flashed through Raymon\'s brain. The moment had come to subdue\r\nthat womanly pride, or it would never come. She had offered him all the\r\nsacrifices that he did not want, and she stood before him in overweening\r\nconfidence that she ran no other risks than those she had foreseen.\r\nRaymon conceived a scheme for ridding himself of her embarrassing\r\ndevotion or of deriving some profit from it. He was too good a friend of\r\nDelmare, he owed too much consideration to the man\'s unbounded\r\nconfidence to steal his wife from him; he must content himself with\r\nseducing her.\r\n\r\n"You are right, my Indiana," he cried with animation, "you bring me back\r\nto myself, you rekindle my transports which the thought of your danger\r\nand the dread of injuring you had cooled. Forgive my childish solicitude\r\nand let me prove to you how much of tenderness and genuine love it\r\ndenotes. Your sweet voice makes my blood quiver, your burning words pour\r\nfire into my veins; forgive, oh! forgive me for having thought of\r\nanything else than this ineffable moment when I at last possess you. Let\r\nme forget all the dangers that threaten us and thank you on my knees for\r\nthe happiness you bring me; let me live entirely in this hour of bliss\r\nwhich I pass at your feet and for which all my blood would not pay. Let\r\nhim come, that dolt of a husband who locks you up and goes to sleep upon\r\nhis vulgar brutality, let him come and snatch you from my transports!\r\nlet him come and snatch you from my arms, my treasure, my life!\r\nHenceforth you do not belong to him; you are my sweetheart, my\r\ncompanion, my mistress----"\r\n\r\nAs he pleaded thus, Raymon gradually worked himself up, as he was\r\naccustomed to do when _arguing_ his passions. It was a powerful, a\r\nromantic situation; it offered some risks. Raymon loved danger, like a\r\ngenuine descendant of a race of valiant knights. Every sound that he\r\nheard in the street seemed to denote the coming of the husband to claim\r\nhis wife and his rival\'s blood. To seek the joys of love in the stirring\r\nemotions of such a situation was a diversion worthy of Raymon. For a\r\nquarter of an hour he loved Madame Delmare passionately, he lavished\r\nupon her the seductions of burning eloquence. He was truly powerful in\r\nhis language and sincere in his behavior--this man whose ardent brain\r\nconsidered love-making a polite accomplishment. He played at passion so\r\nwell that he deceived himself. Shame upon that foolish woman! She\r\nabandoned herself in ecstasy to those treacherous demonstrations; she\r\nwas happy, she was radiant with hope and joy; she forgave everything,\r\nshe almost accorded everything.\r\n\r\nBut Raymon ruined himself by over-precipitation. If he had carried his\r\nart so far as to prolong for twenty-four hours the situation in which\r\nIndiana had risked herself, she would perhaps have been his. But the day\r\nwas breaking, bright and rosy; the sun poured floods of light into the\r\nroom, and the noise in the street increased with every moment. Raymon\r\ncast a glance at the clock; it was nearly seven.\r\n\r\n"It is time to have done with it," he thought; "Delmare may appear at\r\nany moment, and before that happens I must induce her to return home\r\nvoluntarily."\r\n\r\nHe became more urgent and less tender; the pallor of his lips betrayed\r\nthe working of an impatience more imperious than delicate. There was in\r\nhis kisses a sort of abruptness, almost anger. Indiana was afraid. A\r\ngood angel spread its wings over that wavering and bewildered soul; she\r\ncame to herself and repelled the attacks of cold and selfish vice.\r\n\r\n"Leave me," she said; "I do not propose to yield through weakness what I\r\nam willing to accord for love or gratitude. You cannot need proofs of my\r\naffection; my presence here is a sufficiently decisive one, and I bring\r\nthe future with me. But allow me to keep all the strength of my\r\nconscience to contend against the powerful obstacles that still separate\r\nus; I need stoicism and tranquillity."\r\n\r\n"What are you talking about?" angrily demanded Raymon, who was furious\r\nat her resistance and had not listened to her.\r\n\r\nAnd, losing his head altogether in that moment of torture and wrath, he\r\npushed her roughly away and strode up and down the room, with heaving\r\nbosom and head on fire; then he took a carafe and drank a large glass of\r\nwater which suddenly calmed his excitement and cooled his love.\r\nWhereupon he looked at her ironically and said:\r\n\r\n"Come, madame, it is time for you to retire."\r\n\r\nA ray of light at last enlightened Indiana and laid Raymon\'s heart bare\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n"You are right," she said.\r\n\r\nAnd she walked toward the door.\r\n\r\n"Pray take your cloak and boa," he said, detaining her.\r\n\r\n"To be sure," she retorted, "those traces of my presence might\r\ncompromise you."\r\n\r\n"You are a child," he said, in a coaxing tone, as he adjusted her cloak\r\nwith ostentatious care; "you know very well that I love you; but really\r\nyou take pleasure in torturing me, and you drive me mad. Wait until I go\r\nand call a cab. If I could, I would escort you home; but that would ruin\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"Pray, do you not think that I am ruined already?" she asked bitterly.\r\n\r\n"No, my darling," replied Raymon, who asked nothing better than to\r\npersuade her to leave him in peace. "Nobody has noticed your absence, as\r\nthey have not come here yet in search of you. Although I should be the\r\nlast one to be suspected, it would be natural to inquire at the houses\r\nof all of your acquaintances. And then you can go and place yourself\r\nunder your aunt\'s protection; indeed, that is the course I advise you to\r\ntake; she will arrange everything. You will be supposed to have passed\r\nthe night at her house."\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare was not listening; she was gazing stupidly at the sun, as\r\nit rose, huge and red, over an expanse of gleaming roofs. Raymon tried\r\nto rouse her from her preoccupation. She turned her eyes on him but\r\nseemed not to recognize him. Her cheeks had a greenish tinge and her\r\nparched lips seemed paralyzed.\r\n\r\nRaymon was terrified. He remembered the other\'s suicide, and, in his\r\nalarm, not knowing which way to turn, dreading lest he should become\r\ntwice a criminal in his own eyes, but feeling too exhausted mentally to\r\nbe able to deceive her again, he pushed her gently into an easy-chair,\r\nlocked the door, and went up to his mother\'s room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHe found her awake; she was accustomed to rise early, the result of\r\nhabits of hard-working activity which she had formed during the\r\nemigration, and which she had not abandoned when she recovered her\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nSeeing Raymon enter her room so late, pale and excited, and in full\r\ndress, she realized that he was struggling in one of the frequent crises\r\nof his stormy life. She had always been his refuge and salvation in\r\nthese periods of agitation, of which no trace remained save a deep and\r\nsorrowful one in her mother-heart. Her life had been withered and used\r\nup by all that Raymon had acquired and reacquired. Her son\'s character,\r\nimpetuous yet cold, reflective yet passionate, was a consequence of her\r\ninexhaustible love and generous indulgence. He would have been a better\r\nman with a mother less kind; but she had accustomed him to make the most\r\nof all the sacrifices that she consented to make for him; she had taught\r\nhim to seek and to advance his own well-being as zealously and as\r\npowerfully as she sought it. Because she deemed herself created to\r\npreserve him from all sorrows and to sacrifice all her own interests to\r\nhim, he had accustomed himself to believe that the whole world was\r\ncreated for him and would place itself in his hand at a word from his\r\nmother. By an abundance of generosity she had succeeded only in forming\r\na selfish heart.\r\n\r\nShe turned pale, did the poor mother, and, sitting up in bed, gazed\r\nanxiously at him. Her glance said at once: "What can I do for you? Where\r\nmust I go?"\r\n\r\n"Mother," he said, grasping the dry, transparent hand that she held out\r\nto him, "I am horribly unhappy, I need your help. Save me from the\r\ntroubles by which I am surrounded. I love Madame Delmare, as you\r\nknow----"\r\n\r\n"I did not know it," said Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re, in a tone of affectionate\r\nreproof.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t try to deny it, dear mother," said Raymon, who had no time to\r\nwaste; "you did know it, and your admirable delicacy prevented you\r\nspeaking of it first. Well, that woman is driving me to despair, and my\r\nbrain is going."\r\n\r\n"Tell me what you mean!" said Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re, with the youthful\r\nvivacity born of ardent maternal love.\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to conceal anything from you, especially as I am not\r\nguilty this time. For several months I have been trying to calm her\r\nromantic brain and bring her back to a sense of her duties; but all my\r\nefforts serve only to intensify this thirst for danger, this craving for\r\nadventure that ferments in the brains of all the women of her country.\r\nAt this moment she is here, in my room, against my will, and I cannot\r\ninduce her to go away."\r\n\r\n"Unhappy child!" said Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re, dressing herself in haste.\r\n"Such a timid, gentle creature! I will go and see her, talk to her! that\r\nis what you came to ask me to do, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes," said Raymon, moved involuntarily by his mother\'s goodness of\r\nheart; "go and make her understand the language of reason and kindness.\r\nShe will love virtue from your lips, I doubt not; perhaps she will give\r\nway to your caresses; she will recover her self-control, poor creature!\r\nshe suffers so keenly!"\r\n\r\nRaymon threw himself into a chair and began to weep, the divers emotions\r\nof the morning had so shaken his nerves. His mother wept with him and\r\ncould not make up her mind to go down until she had forced him to take\r\na few drops of ether.\r\n\r\nIndiana was not weeping and rose with a calm and dignified air when she\r\nrecognized her. Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re was so little prepared for such a\r\ndignified and noble bearing, that she felt embarrassed before the\r\nyounger woman, as if she had shown lack of consideration for her by\r\ntaking her by surprise in her son\'s bedroom. She yielded to the deep and\r\ntrue emotion of her heart and opened her arms impulsively. Madame\r\nDelmare threw herself into them; her despair found vent in bitter sobs\r\nand the two women wept a long while on each other\'s bosom.\r\n\r\nBut when Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re would have spoken, Indiana checked her.\r\n\r\n"Do not say anything to me, madame," she said, wiping away her tears;\r\n"you could find no words to say that would not cause me pain. Your\r\ninterest and your kisses are enough to prove your generous affection; my\r\nheart is as much relieved as it can be. I will go now; I do not need\r\nyour urging to realize what I have to do."\r\n\r\n"But I did not come to send you away, but to comfort you," said Madame\r\nde Rami\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\n"I cannot be comforted," she replied, kissing her once more; "love me,\r\nthat will help me a little; but do not speak to me. Adieu, madame; you\r\nbelieve in God--pray for me."\r\n\r\n"You shall not go alone!" cried Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re; "I will myself go\r\nwith you to your husband, to justify you, defend you and protect you."\r\n\r\n"Generous woman!" said Indiana, embracing her warmly, "you cannot do it.\r\nYou alone are ignorant of Raymon\'s secret; all Paris will be talking\r\nabout it to-night, and you would play an incongruous part in such a\r\nstory. Let me bear the scandal of it alone; I shall not suffer long."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean? would you commit the crime of taking your own life?\r\nDear child! you too believe in God, do you not?"\r\n\r\n"And so, madame, I start for Ile Bourbon in three days."\r\n\r\n"Come to my arms, my darling child! come and let me bless you! God will\r\nreward your courage."\r\n\r\n"I trust so," said Indiana, looking up at the sky.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rami\xc3\xa8re insisted on sending for a carriage; but Indiana\r\nresisted. She was resolved to return alone and without causing a\r\nsensation. In vain did Raymon\'s mother express her alarm at the idea of\r\nher undertaking so long a journey on foot in her exhausted, agitated\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n"I have strength enough," she said; "a word from Raymon sufficed to give\r\nme all I need."\r\n\r\nShe wrapped herself in her cloak, lowered her black lace veil and left\r\nthe house by a secret door to which Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re showed her the\r\nway. As soon as she stepped into the street she felt as if her trembling\r\nlegs would refuse to carry her; it seemed to her every moment that she\r\ncould feel her furious husband\'s brutal hand seize her, throw her down\r\nand drag her in the gutter. Soon the noise in the street, the\r\nindifference of the faces that passed her on every side and the\r\npenetrating chill of the morning air restored her strength and\r\ntranquillity, but it was a pitiable sort of strength and a tranquillity\r\nas depressing as that which sometimes prevails on the ocean and alarms\r\nthe far-sighted sailor more than the howling of the tempest. She walked\r\nalong the quays from the Institute to the Corps L\xc3\xa9gislatif; but she\r\nforgot to cross the bridge and continued to wander by the river,\r\nabsorbed in a bewildered reverie, in meditation without ideas, and\r\nwalking aimlessly on and on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration 04: _SIR RALPH SAVES INDIANA_\r\n_In that moment of vertigo she leaned against a\r\nwall and bent forward, fascinated, over what seemed\r\nto her a solid mass. But the bark of a dog that was\r\ncapering about her distracted her thoughts and delayed\r\nfor some seconds the accomplishment of her\r\ndesign. Meanwhile a man ran to the spot, guided\r\nby the dog\'s voice, seized her around the waist,\r\ndragged her back and laid her on the ruins of an\r\nabandoned boat on the shore._]\r\n\r\n\r\nShe gradually drew nearer to the river, which washed pieces of ice\r\nashore at her feet and shattered them on the stones along the shore with\r\na dry sound that suggested cold. The greenish water exerted an\r\nattractive force on Indiana\'s senses. One becomes accustomed to horrible\r\nideas; by dint of dwelling on them one takes pleasure in them. The\r\nthought of Noun\'s suicide had soothed her hours of despair for so many\r\nmonths, that suicide had assumed in her mind the form of a tempting\r\npleasure. A single thought, a religious thought, had prevented her from\r\ndeciding definitely upon it; but at this moment no well-defined thought\r\ncontrolled her exhausted brain. She hardly remembered that God existed,\r\nthat Raymon ever existed, and she walked on, still drawing nearer the\r\nbank, obeying the instinct of unhappiness and the magnetic force of\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nWhen she felt the stinging cold of the water on her feet, she woke as if\r\nfrom a fit of somnambulism, and on looking about to discover where she\r\nwas, saw Paris behind her and the Seine rushing by at her feet, bearing\r\nin its oily depths the white reflection of the houses and the grayish\r\nblue of the sky. This constant movement of the water and the immobility\r\nof the ground became confused in her bewildered mind, and it seemed to\r\nher that the water was sleeping and the ground moving. In that moment of\r\nvertigo she leaned against a wall and bent forward, fascinated, over\r\nwhat seemed to her a solid mass. But the bark of a dog that was capering\r\nabout her distracted her thoughts and delayed for some seconds the\r\naccomplishment of her design. Meanwhile a man ran to the spot, guided by\r\nthe dog\'s voice, seized her around the waist, dragged her back and laid\r\nher on the ruins of an abandoned boat on the shore. She looked in his\r\nface and did not recognize him. He knelt at her foot, unfastened his\r\ncloak and wrapped it about her, took her hands in his to warm them and\r\ncalled her by name. But her brain was too weak to make an effort; for\r\nforty-eight hours she had forgotten to eat.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the blood began to circulate in her benumbed limbs, she\r\nsaw Ralph kneeling beside her, holding her hands and watching for the\r\nreturn of consciousness.\r\n\r\n"Did you meet Noun?" she asked him. "I saw her pass along there," she\r\nadded, pointing to the river, distracted by her fixed idea. "I tried to\r\nfollow her, but she walked too fast, and I am not strong enough to walk.\r\nIt was like a nightmare."\r\n\r\nRalph looked at her in sore distress. He too felt as if his head were\r\nbursting and his brain running wild.\r\n\r\n"Let us go," she continued; "but first see if you can find my feet; I\r\nlost them on the stones."\r\n\r\nRalph saw that her feet were wet and paralyzed by cold. He carried her\r\nin his arms to a house near by, where the kindly care of a hospitable\r\nwoman restored her to consciousness. Meanwhile Ralph sent word to\r\nMonsieur Delmare that his wife was found; but the colonel had not\r\nreturned home when the news arrived. He was continuing his search in a\r\nfrenzy of anxiety and wrath. Ralph, being more perspicacious, had gone\r\nto Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s, but he had found Raymon, who had just gone to\r\nbed and who was very cool and ironical in his reception of him. Then he\r\nhad thought of Noun and had followed the river in one direction, while\r\nhis servant did the same in the other direction. Ophelia had speedily\r\nfound her mistress\'s scent and had led Ralph to the place where he found\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWhen Indiana was able to recall what had taken place during that\r\nwretched night, she tried in vain to remember the occurrences of her\r\nmoments of delirium. She was unable therefore to explain to her cousin\r\nwhat thoughts had guided her action during the last hour; but he divined\r\nthem and understood the state of her heart without questioning her. He\r\nsimply took her hand and said to her in a gentle but grave tone:\r\n\r\n"Cousin, I require one promise from you; it is the last proof of\r\nfriendship which I shall ever ask at your hands."\r\n\r\n"Tell me what it is," she replied; "to oblige you is the only pleasure\r\nthat is left to me."\r\n\r\n"Well then," rejoined Ralph, "swear to me that you will not resort to\r\nsuicide without notifying me. I swear to you on my honor that I will not\r\noppose your design in any way. I simply insist on being notified: as for\r\nlife, I care about it as little as you do, and you know that I have\r\noften had the same idea."\r\n\r\n"Why do you talk of suicide?" said Madame Delmare. "I have never\r\nintended to take my own life. I am afraid of God; if it weren\'t for\r\nthat!----"\r\n\r\n"Just now, Indiana, when I seized you in my arms, when this poor\r\nbeast"--and he patted Ophelia--"caught your dress, you had forgotten God\r\nand the whole universe, poor Ralph with the rest."\r\n\r\nA tear stood in Indiana\'s eye. She pressed Sir Ralph\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Why did you stop me?" she said sadly; "I should be on God\'s bosom now,\r\nfor I was not guilty, I did not know what I was doing."\r\n\r\n"I saw that, and I thought that it was better to commit suicide after\r\ndue reflection. We will talk about it again if you choose."\r\n\r\nIndiana shuddered. The cab stopped in front of the house where she was\r\nto confront her husband. She had not the strength to mount the steps and\r\nRalph carried her to her room. Their whole retinue was reduced to a\r\nsingle maid servant, who had gone to discuss Madame Delmare\'s flight\r\nwith the neighbors, and Leli\xc3\xa8vre, who, in despair, had gone to the\r\nmorgue to inspect the bodies brought in that morning. So Ralph remained\r\nwith Madame Delmare to nurse her. She was suffering intensely when a\r\nloud peal of the bell announced the colonel\'s return. A shudder of\r\nterror and hatred ran through her every vein. She seized her cousin\'s\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"Listen, Ralph," she said; "if you have the slightest affection for me,\r\nyou will spare me the sight of that man in my present condition. I do\r\nnot want to arouse his pity, I prefer his anger to that. Do not open the\r\ndoor, or else send him away; tell him that I haven\'t been found."\r\n\r\nHer lips quivered, her arms clung to Ralph with convulsive strength, to\r\ndetain him. Torn by two conflicting feelings, the poor baronet could not\r\nmake up his mind what to do. Delmare was jangling the bell as if he\r\nwould break it, and his wife was almost dying in his chair.\r\n\r\n"You think only of his anger," said Ralph at last; "you do not think of\r\nhis misery, his anxiety; you still believe that he hates you. If you had\r\nseen his grief this morning!"\r\n\r\nIndiana dropped her arms, thoroughly exhausted, and Ralph went and\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\n"Is she here?" cried the colonel, rushing in. "Ten thousand devils! I\r\nhave run about enough after her; I am deeply obliged to her for putting\r\nsuch a pleasant duty on me! Deuce take her! I don\'t want to see her, for\r\nI should kill her!"\r\n\r\n"You forget that she can hear you," replied Ralph in an undertone. "She\r\nis in no condition to bear any painful excitement. Be calm."\r\n\r\n"Twenty-five thousand maledictions!" roared the colonel. "I have endured\r\nenough myself since this morning. It\'s a good thing for me that my\r\nnerves are like cables. Which of us is the more injured, the more\r\nexhausted, which of us has the better right to be sick, I pray to\r\nknow,--she or I? And where did you find her? what was she doing? She is\r\nresponsible for my having outrageously insulted that foolish old woman,\r\nCarvajal, who gave me ambiguous answers and blamed me for this charming\r\nfreak! Damnation! I am dead beat!"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke thus in his harsh, hoarse voice, Delmare had thrown himself\r\non a chair in the ante-room; he wiped his brow from which the\r\nperspiration was streaming despite the intense cold; he described with\r\nmany oaths his fatigues, his anxieties, his sufferings; he asked a\r\nthousand questions, and, luckily, did not listen to the answers, for\r\npoor Ralph could not lie, and he could think of nothing in what he had\r\nto tell that was likely to appease the colonel. So he sat on a table, as\r\nsilent and unmoved as if he were absolutely without interest in the\r\nsufferings of those two, and yet he was really more unhappy in their\r\nunhappiness than they themselves were.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare, when she heard her husband\'s imprecations, felt stronger\r\nthan she expected. She preferred this fierce wrath, which reconciled her\r\nwith herself, to a generous forbearance which would have aroused her\r\nremorse. She wiped away the last trace of her tears and summoned what\r\nremained of her strength, which she was well content to expend in a day,\r\nso heavy a burden had life become to her. Her husband accosted her in a\r\nharsh and imperious tone, but suddenly changed his expression and his\r\nmanner and seemed sorely embarrassed, overmatched by the superiority of\r\nher character. He tried to be as cool and dignified as she was; but he\r\ncould not succeed.\r\n\r\n"Will you condescend to inform me, madame," he said, "where you passed\r\nthe morning and perhaps the night?"\r\n\r\nThat _perhaps_ indicated to Madame Delmare that her absence had not been\r\ndiscovered until late. Her courage increased with that knowledge.\r\n\r\n"No, monsieur," she replied, "I do not propose to tell you."\r\n\r\nDelmare turned green with anger and amazement.\r\n\r\n"Do you really hope to conceal the truth from me?" he said, in a\r\ntrembling voice.\r\n\r\n"I care very little about it," she replied in an icy tone. "I refuse to\r\ntell you solely for form\'s sake. I propose to convince you that you have\r\nno right to ask me that question?"\r\n\r\n"I have no right, ten thousand devils. Who is master here, pray tell,\r\nyou or I? Which of us wears a petticoat and ought to be running a\r\ndistaff? Do you propose to take the beard off my chin? It would look\r\nwell on you, hussy!"\r\n\r\n"I know that I am the slave and you the master. The laws of this country\r\nmake you my master. You can bind my body, tie my hands, govern my acts.\r\nYou have the right of the stronger, and society confirms you in it; but\r\nyou cannot command my will, monsieur; God alone can bend it and subdue\r\nit. Try to find a law, a dungeon, an instrument of torture that gives\r\nyou any hold on it! you might as well try to handle the air and grasp\r\nspace."\r\n\r\n"Hold your tongue, you foolish, impertinent creature; your high-flown\r\nnovelist\'s phrases weary me."\r\n\r\n"You can impose silence on me, but not prevent me from thinking."\r\n\r\n"Silly pride! pride of a poor worm! you abuse the compassion I have had\r\nfor you! But you will soon see that this mighty will can be subdued\r\nwithout too much difficulty."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t advise you to try it; your repose would suffer, and you would\r\ngain nothing in dignity."\r\n\r\n"Do you think so?" he said, crushing her hand between his thumb and\r\nforefinger.\r\n\r\n"I do think so," she said, without wincing.\r\n\r\nRalph stepped forward, grasped the colonel\'s arm in his iron hand and\r\nbent it like a reed, saying in a pacific tone:\r\n\r\n"I beg that you will not touch a hair of that woman\'s head."\r\n\r\nDelmare longed to fly at him; but he felt that he was in the wrong and\r\nhe dreaded nothing in the world so much as having to blush for himself.\r\nSo he simply pushed him away, saying:\r\n\r\n"Attend to your own business."\r\n\r\nThen he returned to his wife.\r\n\r\n"So, madame," he said, holding his arms tightly against his sides to\r\nresist the temptation to strike her, "you rebel against me, you refuse\r\nto go to Ile Bourbon with me, you desire a separation? Very well!\r\n_Mordieu!_ I too----"\r\n\r\n"I desire it no longer," she replied. "I did desire it yesterday, it was\r\nmy will; it is not so this morning. You resorted to violence and locked\r\nme in my room; I went out through the window to show you that there is a\r\ndifference between exerting an absurd control over a woman\'s actions and\r\nreigning over her will. I passed several hours away from your\r\ndomination; I breathed the air of liberty in order to show you that you\r\nare not morally my master, and that I look to no one on earth but myself\r\nfor orders. As I walked along I reflected that I owed it to my duty and\r\nmy conscience to return and place myself under your control once more. I\r\ndid it of my own free will. My cousin _accompanied_ me here, he did not\r\n_bring me back_. If I had not chosen to come with him, he could not have\r\nforced me to do it, as you can imagine. So, monsieur, do not waste your\r\ntime fighting against my determination; you will never control it, you\r\nlost all right to change it as soon as you undertook to assert your\r\nright by force. Make your preparations for departure; I am ready to\r\nassist you and to accompany you, not because it is your will, but\r\nbecause it is my pleasure. You may condemn me, but I will never obey\r\nanyone but myself."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry for the derangement of your mind," said the colonel,\r\nshrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nAnd he went to his room to put his papers in order, well satisfied in\r\nhis heart with Madame Delmare\'s resolution and anticipating no further\r\nobstacles; for he respected her word as much as he despised her ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nRaymon, yielding to fatigue, slept soundly after his curt reception of\r\nSir Ralph, who came to his house to make inquiries. When he awoke, his\r\nheart was full of a feeling of intense relief; he believed that the\r\nworst crisis of his intrigue had finally come and gone. For a long time\r\nhe had foreseen that there would come a time when he would be brought\r\nface to face with that woman\'s love and would have to defend his liberty\r\nagainst the exacting demands of a romantic passion; and he encouraged\r\nhimself in advance by arguing against such pretensions. He had at last\r\nreached and crossed that dangerous spot: he had said no, he would have\r\nno occasion to go there again, for everything had happened for the best.\r\nIndiana had not wept overmuch, had not been too insistent. She had been\r\nquite reasonable; she had understood at the first word and had made up\r\nher mind quickly and proudly.\r\n\r\nRaymon was very well pleased with his providence; for he had one of his\r\nown, in whom he believed like a good son, and upon whom he relied to\r\narrange everything to other people\'s detriment rather than his own. That\r\nprovidence had treated him so well thus far that he did not choose to\r\ndoubt it. To anticipate the result of his wrong-doing and to be anxious\r\nconcerning it would have been in his eyes a crime against the good Lord\r\nwho watched over him.\r\n\r\nHe rose, still very much fatigued by the efforts of the imagination\r\nwhich the circumstances of that painful scene had compelled him to make.\r\nHis mother returned; she had been to Madame de Carvajal to inquire as to\r\nMadame Delmare\'s health and frame of mind. The marchioness was not\r\ndisturbed about her; she was, however, very much disgusted when Madame\r\nde Rami\xc3\xa8re shrewdly questioned her. But the only thing that impressed\r\nher in Madame Delmare\'s disappearance was the scandal that would result\r\nfrom it. She complained very bitterly of her niece, whom, only the day\r\nbefore, she had extolled to the skies; and Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re understood\r\nthat the unfortunate Indiana had, by this performance, alienated her\r\nkinswoman and lost the only natural prop that she still possessed.\r\n\r\nTo one who could read in the depths of the marchioness\'s soul, this\r\nwould have seemed no great loss; but Madame de Carvajal was esteemed\r\nvirtuous beyond reproach, even by Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re. Her youth had been\r\nenveloped in the mysteries of prudence, or lost in the whirlwind of\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nRaymon\'s mother wept over Indiana\'s lot and tried to excuse her; Madame\r\nde Carvajal tartly reminded her that she was not sufficiently\r\ndisinterested in the matter to judge.\r\n\r\n"But what will become of the unhappy creature?" said Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re.\r\n"If her husband maltreats her, who will protect her?"\r\n\r\n"That will be as God wills," replied the marchioness; "for my part, I\'ll\r\nhave nothing more to do with her and I never wish to see her again."\r\n\r\nMadame de Rami\xc3\xa8re, kind-hearted and anxious, determined to obtain news\r\nof Madame Delmare at any price. She bade her coachman drive to the end\r\nof the street on which she lived and sent a footman to question the\r\nconcierge, instructing him to try to see Sir Ralph if he were in the\r\nhouse. She awaited in her carriage the result of this man\xc5\x93uvre, and\r\nRalph himself soon joined her there.\r\n\r\nThe only person, perhaps, who judged Ralph accurately was Madame de\r\nRami\xc3\xa8re; a few words sufficed to make each of them understand the\r\nother\'s sincere and unselfish interest in the matter. Ralph narrated\r\nwhat had passed during the morning; and, as he had nothing more than\r\nsuspicions concerning the events of the night, he did not seek\r\nconfirmation of them. But Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re deemed it her duty to\r\ninform him of what she knew, imparting to him her desire to break off\r\nthis ill-omened and impossible liaison. Ralph, who felt more at ease\r\nwith her than with anybody else, allowed the profound emotion which her\r\ninformation caused him to appear on his face.\r\n\r\n"You say, madame," he murmured, repressing a sort of nervous shudder\r\nthat ran through his veins, "that she passed the night in your house?"\r\n\r\n"A solitary and sorrowful night, no doubt. Raymon, who certainly was not\r\nguilty of complicity, did not come home until six o\'clock, and at seven\r\nhe came up to me to ask me to go down and soothe the poor child\'s mind."\r\n\r\n"She meant to leave her husband! she meant to destroy her good name!"\r\nrejoined Ralph, his eyes fixed on vacancy and a strange oppression at\r\nhis heart. "Then she must love this man, who is so unworthy of her, very\r\ndearly!"\r\n\r\nRalph forgot that he was talking to Raymon\'s mother.\r\n\r\n"I have suspected this a long while," he continued; "why could I not\r\nhave foretold the day on which she would consummate her ruin! I would\r\nhave killed her first!"\r\n\r\nSuch language in Ralph\'s mouth surprised Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re beyond\r\nmeasure; she supposed that she was speaking to a calm, indulgent man,\r\nand she regretted that she had trusted to appearances.\r\n\r\n"_Mon Dieu!_" she said in dismay, "do you judge her without mercy? will\r\nyou abandon her as her aunt has? Are you incapable of pity or\r\nforgiveness? Will she not have a single friend left after a fault which\r\nhas already caused her such bitter suffering?"\r\n\r\n"Have no fear of anything of the sort on my part, madame," Ralph\r\nreplied; "I have known all for six months and I have said nothing. I\r\nsurprised their first kiss and I did not hurl Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re from\r\nhis horse; I often intercepted their love messages in the woods and did\r\nnot tear them in pieces with my whip. I met Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re on the\r\nbridge he must cross to go to join her; it was night, we were alone and\r\nI am four times as strong as he; and yet I did not throw the man into\r\nthe river; and when, after allowing him to escape, I discovered that he\r\nhad eluded my vigilance and had stolen into her house, instead of\r\nbursting in the doors and throwing him out of the window, I quietly\r\nwarned them of the husband\'s approach and saved the life of one in order\r\nto save the other\'s honor. You see, madame, that I am indulgent and\r\nmerciful. This morning I had that man under my hand; I was well aware\r\nthat he was the cause of all our misery, and, if I had not the right to\r\naccuse him without proofs, I certainly should have been justified in\r\nquarreling with him for his arrogant and mocking manner. But I bore with\r\nhis insulting contempt because I knew that his death would kill Indiana;\r\nI allowed him to turn over and fall asleep again on the other side,\r\nwhile Indiana, insane and almost dead, was on the shore of the Seine,\r\npreparing to join his other victim. You see, madame, that I practise\r\npatience with those whom I hate and indulgence with those I love."\r\n\r\nMadame de Rami\xc3\xa8re, sitting in her carriage opposite Ralph, gazed at him\r\nin surprise mingled with alarm. He was so different from what she had\r\nalways seen him that she almost believed that he had suddenly become\r\nderanged. The allusion he had just made to Noun\'s death confirmed her in\r\nthat idea; for she knew absolutely nothing of that story and took the\r\nwords that Ralph had let fall in his indignation for a fragment of\r\nthought unconnected with his subject. He was, in very truth, passing\r\nthrough one of those periods of intense excitement which occur at least\r\nonce in the lives of the most placid men, and which border so closely on\r\nmadness that one step farther would carry them across the line. His\r\nwrath was restrained and concentrated like that of all cold\r\ntemperaments; but it was deep, like the wrath of all noble souls; and\r\nthe novelty of this frame of mind, which was truly portentous in him,\r\nmade him terrible to look upon.\r\n\r\nMadame de Rami\xc3\xa8re took his hand and said gently:\r\n\r\n"You must suffer terribly, my dear Monsieur Ralph, for you wound me\r\nwithout mercy: you forget that the man of whom you speak is my son and\r\nthat his wrong-doing, if he has been guilty of any, must be infinitely\r\nmore painful to me than to you."\r\n\r\nRalph at once came to himself, and said, kissing Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re\'s\r\nhand with an effusive warmth of regard, which was almost as unusual a\r\nmanifestation on his part as that of his wrath:\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, madame; you are right, I do suffer terribly, and I forget\r\nthose things which I should respect. Pray, forget yourself the\r\nbitterness I have allowed to appear! my heart will not fail to lock\r\nitself up again."\r\n\r\nMadame de Rami\xc3\xa8re, although somewhat reassured by this reply, could not\r\nrid herself of all anxiety when she saw with what profound hatred Ralph\r\nregarded her son. She tried to excuse him in his enemy\'s eyes, but he\r\nchecked her.\r\n\r\n"I divine your thoughts, madame," he said; "but have no fear, Monsieur\r\nde Rami\xc3\xa8re and I are not likely to meet again at present. As for my\r\ncousin, do not regret having enlightened me. If the whole world abandons\r\nher, I swear that she will always have at least one friend."\r\n\r\nWhen Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re returned home, toward evening, she found Raymon\r\nluxuriously ensconced in front of the fire, warming his slippered feet\r\nand drinking tea to banish the last vestiges of the nervous excitement\r\nof the morning. He was still cast down by that artificial emotion; but\r\npleasant thoughts of the future revivified his faculties; he felt that\r\nhe had become free once more, and he abandoned himself unreservedly to\r\nblissful meditations upon that priceless condition, which he had\r\nhitherto been so unsuccessful in maintaining.\r\n\r\n"Why am I destined," he said to himself, "to weary so quickly of this\r\npriceless freedom of the heart which I always have to buy so dearly?\r\nWhen I feel that I am caught in a woman\'s net, I cannot break it quickly\r\nenough, in order to recover my repose and mental tranquillity. May I be\r\ncursed if I sacrifice them in such a hurry again! The trouble these two\r\ncreoles have caused me will serve as a warning, and hereafter I do not\r\npropose to meddle with any but easy-going, laughing Parisian\r\nwomen--genuine women of the world. Perhaps I should do well to marry and\r\nhave done with it, as they say----"\r\n\r\nHe was absorbed by such comforting, commonplace thoughts as these, when\r\nhis mother entered, tired and deeply moved.\r\n\r\n"She is better," she said; "everything has gone off as well as possible;\r\nI hope that she will grow calmer and----"\r\n\r\n"Who?" inquired Raymon, waking with a start among his castles in Spain.\r\n\r\nHowever, he concluded on the following day that he still had a duty to\r\nperform, namely, to regain that woman\'s esteem, if not her love. He did\r\nnot choose that she should boast of having left him; he proposed that\r\nshe should be persuaded that she had yielded to the influence of his\r\ngood sense and his generosity. He desired to govern her even after he\r\nhad spurned her; and he wrote to her as follows:\r\n\r\n"I do not write to ask your pardon, my dear, for a few cruel or\r\naudacious words that escaped me in the delirium of my passion. In the\r\nderangement of fever no man can form perfectly coherent ideas or express\r\nhimself in a proper manner. It is not my fault that I am not a god, that\r\nI cannot control in your presence the turbulent ardor of my blood, that\r\nmy brain whirls, that I go mad. Perhaps I may have a right to complain\r\nof the merciless _sang-froid_ with which you condemned me to frightful\r\ntorture and never took pity on me; but that was not your fault. You are\r\ntoo perfect to play the same r\xc3\xb4le in this world that we common mortals\r\nplay, subject as we are to human passions, slaves of our less-refined\r\norganization. As I have often told you, Indiana, you are not a woman,\r\nand, when I think of you tranquilly and without excitement, you are an\r\nangel. I adore you in my heart as a divinity. But alas! in your presence\r\nthe _old Adam_ has often reasserted his rights. Often, under the\r\nperfumed breath from your lips, a scorching flame has consumed mine;\r\noften when, as I leaned toward you, my hair has brushed against yours, a\r\nthrill of indescribable bliss has run through my veins, and thereupon I\r\nhave forgotten that you were an emanation from Heaven, a dream of\r\neverlasting felicity, an angel sent from God\'s bosom to guide my steps\r\nin this life and to describe to me the joys of another existence. Why, O\r\nchaste spirit, did you assume the alluring form of a woman? Why, O angel\r\nof light, did you clothe yourself in the seductions of hell? Often have\r\nI thought that I held happiness in my arms, and it was only virtue.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me these reprehensible regrets, my love; I was not worthy of\r\nyou, but perhaps we should both have been happier if you would have\r\nconsented to stoop to my level. But my inferiority has constantly caused\r\nyou pain and you have imputed your own virtues to me as crimes.\r\n\r\n"Now that you absolve me--as I am sure that you do, for perfection\r\nimplies mercy--let me still raise my voice to thank you and bless you.\r\nThank you, do I say? Ah! no, my life, that is not the word; for my heart\r\nis more torn than yours by the courage that snatches you from my arms.\r\nBut I admire you; and, through my tears, I congratulate you. Yes, my\r\nIndiana, you have mustered strength to accomplish this heroic sacrifice.\r\nIt tears out my heart and my life; it renders my future desolate, it\r\nruins my existence. But I love you well enough to endure it without a\r\ncomplaint; for my honor is nothing, yours is all in all. I would\r\nsacrifice my honor to you a thousand times; but yours is dearer to me\r\nthan all the joys you have given me. No, no! I could not have enjoyed\r\nsuch a sacrifice. In vain should I have tried to blunt my conscience by\r\ndelirious transports; in vain would you have opened your arms to\r\nintoxicate me with celestial joys--remorse would have found me out; it\r\nwould have poisoned every hour of my life, and I should have been more\r\nhumiliated than you by the contempt of men. O God! to see you degraded\r\nand brought to shame by me! to see you deprived of the veneration which\r\nencompassed you! to see you insulted in my arms and to be unable to wipe\r\nout the insult! for, though I should have shed all my blood for you, it\r\nwould not have availed you. I might have avenged you, perhaps, but could\r\nnever have justified you. My zeal in your defence would have been an\r\nadditional accusation against you; my death an unquestionable proof of\r\nyour crime. Poor Indiana! I should have ruined you! Ah! how miserably\r\nunhappy I should be!\r\n\r\n"Go, therefore, my beloved; go and reap under another sky the fruits of\r\nvirtue and religion. God will reward us for such an effort, for God is\r\ngood. He will reunite us in a happier life, and perhaps--but the mere\r\nthought is a crime; and yet I cannot refrain from hoping! Adieu,\r\nIndiana, adieu! You see that our love is a sin! Alas! my heart is\r\nbroken. Where could I find strength to say adieu to you!"\r\n\r\nRaymon himself carried this letter to Madame Delmare\'s; but she shut\r\nherself up in her room and refused to see him. So he left the house\r\nafter handing the letter secretly to the servant and cordially embracing\r\nthe husband. As he left the last step behind him, he felt much\r\nbetter-hearted than usual; the weather was finer, the women fairer, the\r\nshops more brilliant. It was a red-letter day in Raymon\'s life.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare placed the letter, with the seal unbroken, in a box which\r\nshe did not propose to open until she reached her destination. She\r\nwished to go to take leave of her aunt, but Sir Ralph with downright\r\nobstinacy opposed her doing so. He had seen Madame de Carvajal; he knew\r\nthat she would overwhelm Indiana with reproaches and scorn; he was\r\nindignant at this hypocritical severity, and could not endure the\r\nthought of Madame Delmare exposing herself to it.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, as Delmare and his wife were about entering the\r\ndiligence, Sir Ralph said to them with his accustomed _sang-froid_:\r\n\r\n"I have often given you to understand, my friends, that it was my wish\r\nto accompany you; but you have refused to understand, or, at all events,\r\nto give me an answer. Will you allow me to go with you?"\r\n\r\n"To Bordeaux?" queried Monsieur Delmare.\r\n\r\n"To Bourbon," replied Sir Ralph.\r\n\r\n"You cannot think of it," rejoined Monsieur Delmare; "you cannot shift\r\nyour establishment about from place to place at the caprice of a couple\r\nwhose situation is precarious and whose future is uncertain. It would be\r\nabusing your friendship shamefully to accept the sacrifice of your whole\r\nlife and of your position in society. You are rich and young and free;\r\nyou ought to marry again, found a family--"\r\n\r\n"That is not the question," said Sir Ralph, coldly. "As I have not the\r\nart of enveloping my ideas in words which change their meaning, I will\r\ntell you frankly what I think. It has seemed to me that in the last six\r\nmonths our friendship has fallen off perceptibly. Perhaps I have made\r\nmistakes which my dulness of perception has prevented me from detecting.\r\nIf I am wrong, a word from you will suffice to set my mind at rest;\r\nallow me to go with you. If I have deserved severe treatment at your\r\nhands, it is time to tell me so; you ought not, by abandoning me thus,\r\nto leave me to suffer remorse for having failed to make reparation for\r\nmy faults."\r\n\r\nThe colonel was so touched by this artless and generous appeal that he\r\nforgot all the wounds to his self-esteem which had alienated him from\r\nhis friend. He offered him his hand, swore that his friendship was more\r\nsincere than ever, and that he refused his offers only from delicacy.\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare held her peace. Ralph made an effort to obtain a word\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n"And you, Indiana," he said in a stifled voice, "have you still a\r\nfriendly feeling for me?"\r\n\r\nThat question reawoke all the filial affection, all the memories of\r\nchildhood, of years of intimacy, which bound their hearts together. They\r\nthrew themselves weeping into each other\'s arms, and Ralph nearly\r\nswooned; for strong emotions were constantly fermenting in that robust\r\nbody, beneath that calm and reserved exterior. He sat down to avoid\r\nfalling and remained for a few moments without speaking, pale as death;\r\nthen he seized the colonel\'s hand in one of his and his wife\'s in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"At this moment, when we are about to part, perhaps forever, be frank\r\nwith me. You refuse my proposal to accompany you on my account and not\r\non your own?"\r\n\r\n"I give you my word of honor," said Delmare, "that in refusing you I\r\nsacrifice my happiness to yours."\r\n\r\n"For my part," said Indiana, "you know that I would like never to leave\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"God forbid that I should doubt your sincerity at such a moment!"\r\nrejoined Ralph; "your word is enough for me; I am content with you\r\nboth."\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared.\r\n\r\nSix weeks later the brig _Coraly_ sailed from the port of Bordeaux.\r\nRalph had written to his friends that he would be in that city just\r\nprior to their sailing; but, as his custom was, in such a laconic style\r\nthat it was impossible to determine whether he intended to bid them\r\nadieu for the last time or to accompany them. They waited in vain for\r\nhim until the last moment, and when the captain gave the signal to weigh\r\nanchor he had not appeared. Gloomy presentiments added their bitterness\r\nto the dull pain that gnawed at Indiana\'s heart, when the last houses of\r\nthe town vanished amid the trees on the shore. She shuddered at the\r\nthought that she was thenceforth alone in the world with the husband\r\nwhom she hated! that she must live and die with him, without a friend to\r\ncomfort her, without a kinsman to protect her against his brutal\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nBut, as she turned, she saw on the deck behind her Ralph\'s placid and\r\nkindly face smiling into hers.\r\n\r\n"So you have not abandoned me after all?" she said, as she threw her\r\narms about his neck, her face bathed in tears.\r\n\r\n"Never!" replied Ralph, straining her to his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MADAME DELMARE TO MONSIEUR\r\nDE RAMI\xc3\x88RE\r\n\r\n"Ile Bourbon, June 3d, 18--\r\n\r\n\r\n"I had determined to weary you no more with reminders of me; but, after\r\nreading on my arrival here the letter you sent me just before I left\r\nParis, I feel that I owe you a reply because, in the agitation caused by\r\nhorrible suffering, I went too far. I was mistaken with regard to you,\r\nand I owe you an apology, not as a _lover_ but as a _man._\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, Raymon, for in the most ghastly moment of my life I took\r\nyou for a monster. A single word, a single glance from you banished all\r\nconfidence and all hope from my heart forever. I know that I can never\r\nbe happy again; but I still hope that I may not be driven to despise\r\nyou; that would be the last blow.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I took you for a dastard, for the worst of all human creatures, an\r\n_egotist._ I conceived a horror of you. I regretted that Bourbon was not\r\nso far away as I longed to fly from you, and indignation gave me\r\nstrength to drain the cup to the dregs.\r\n\r\n"But since I have read your letter I feel better. I do not regret you,\r\nbut I no longer hate you, and I do not wish to leave your life a prey to\r\nremorse for having ruined mine. Be happy, be free from care; forget me.\r\nI am still alive and I may live a long while.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that you are not to blame; I was the one who was mad. Your\r\nheart was not dry, but it was closed to me. You did not lie to me, but I\r\ndeceived myself. You were neither perjured nor cold; you simply did not\r\nlove me.\r\n\r\n"Oh! _mon Dieu!_ you did not love me! In heaven\'s name how must you be\r\nloved? But I will not stoop to complaints; I am not writing to you for\r\nthe purpose of poisoning with hateful memories the repose of your\r\npresent life; nor do I propose to implore your compassion for sorrows\r\nwhich I am strong enough to bear alone. On the contrary, knowing better\r\nthe r\xc3\xb4le for which you are suited, I absolve you and forgive you.\r\n\r\n"I will not amuse myself by refuting the charges in your letter; it\r\nwould be too easy a matter; I will not reply to your observations with\r\nregard to my duties. Never fear, Raymon; I am familiar with them and I\r\ndid not love you little enough to disregard them without due reflection.\r\nIt is not necessary to tell me that the scorn of mankind would have been\r\nthe reward of my downfall; I was well aware of it. I knew too that the\r\nstain would be deep, indelible and painful beyond words; that I should\r\nbe spurned on all sides, cursed, covered with shame, and that I should\r\nnot find a single friend to pity me and comfort me. The only mistake I\r\nhad made was the feeling confident that you would open your arms to me,\r\nand that you would assist me to forget the scorn, the misery and the\r\ndesertion of my friends. The only thing I had not anticipated was that\r\nyou might refuse to accept my sacrifice after I had consummated it. I\r\nhad imagined that that was impossible. I went to your house with the\r\nexpectation that you would repel me at first from principle and a sense\r\nof duty, but firmly convinced that when you learned the inevitable\r\nconsequences of what I had done, you would feel bound to assist me to\r\nendure them. No, upon my word I would never have believed that you would\r\nabandon me undefended to the consequences of such a dangerous\r\nresolution, and that you would leave me to gather its bitter fruits\r\ninstead of taking me to your bosom and making a rampart of your love.\r\n\r\n"In that case how gladly I would have defied the distant mutterings of a\r\nworld that was powerless to injure me! how I would have defied hatred,\r\nbeing strong in your love! how feeble my remorse would have been, and\r\nhow easily the passion you would have inspired would have stifled its\r\nvoice! Engrossed by you alone, I would have forgotten myself; proud in\r\nthe possession of your heart, I should have had no time to blush for my\r\nown. A word from you, a glance, a kiss would have sufficed to absolve\r\nme, and the memory of men and laws could have found no place in such a\r\nlife. You see I was mad; according to your cynical expression I had\r\nacquired my knowledge of life from novels written for lady\'s-maids, from\r\nthose gay, childish works of fiction in which the heart is interested in\r\nthe success of wild enterprises and in impossible felicities. What you\r\nsaid, Raymon, was horribly true! The thing that terrifies and crushes me\r\nis that you are right.\r\n\r\n"One thing that I cannot understand so well is that the impossibility\r\nwas not the same for both of us; that I, a weak woman, derived from the\r\nexaltation of my feelings sufficient strength to place myself alone in a\r\nromantic, improbable situation, and that you, a brave man, could not\r\nfind in your will-power, sufficient courage to follow me. And yet you\r\nhad shared my dreams of the future, you had assented to my illusions,\r\nyou had nourished in me that hope impossible of realization. For a long\r\nwhile you had listened to my childish plans, my pygmy-like aspirations,\r\nwith a smile on your lips and joy in your eyes, and your words were all\r\nlove and gratitude. You too were blind, short-sighted, boastful. How did\r\nit happen that your reason did not return until the danger was in sight?\r\nWhy, I thought that danger charmed the eyes, strengthened the\r\nresolution, put fear to flight; and yet you trembled like a leaf when\r\nthe crisis came! Have you men no courage except the physical courage\r\nthat defies death? are you not capable of the moral courage that\r\nwelcomes misfortune? Do you, who explain everything so admirably,\r\nexplain that to me, I beg.\r\n\r\n"It may be that your dream was not like mine; in my case, you see,\r\ncourage was love. You had fancied that you loved me, and you had\r\nawakened, surprised to find that you had made such a mistake, on the day\r\nthat I went forward trusting in the shelter of my mistake. Great God!\r\nwhat an extraordinary delusion it was of yours, since you did not then\r\nforesee all the obstacles that struck you when the time for action came!\r\nsince you did not mention them to me until it was too late!\r\n\r\n"But why should I reproach you now? Are we responsible for the impulses\r\nof our hearts? was it in your power to say that you would always love\r\nme? No, of course not. My misfortune consists in my inability to make\r\nmyself agreeable to you longer and more really. I look about for the\r\ncause of it and find none in my heart; but it apparently exists, none\r\nthe less. Perhaps I loved you too well, perhaps my affection was\r\nannoying and tiresome. You were a man, you loved liberty and pleasure. I\r\nwas a burden to you. Sometimes I tried to put fetters on your life.\r\nAlas! those were very paltry offences to plead in justification of such\r\na cruel desertion!\r\n\r\n"Enjoy, therefore, the liberty you have purchased at the expense of my\r\nwhole life; I will interfere with it no more. Why did you not give me\r\nthis lesson sooner? My wound would have been less deep, and yours also,\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\n"Be happy! that is the last wish my broken heart will ever form! Do not\r\nexhort me to think of God, leave that for the priests, who have to\r\nsoften the hard hearts of the guilty. For my part, I have more faith\r\nthan you; I do not serve the same God, but I serve Him more loyally and\r\nwith a purer heart. Yours is the God of men, the king, the founder and\r\nthe upholder of your race; mine is the God of the universe, the creator,\r\nthe preserver and the hope of all creatures. Yours made everything for\r\nyou alone; mine made all created things for one another. You deem\r\nyourselves the masters of the world; I deem you only its tyrants. You\r\nthink that God protects you and authorizes you to possess the empire of\r\nthe earth; I think that He permits that for a little time, and that the\r\nday will come when His breath will scatter you like grains of sand. No,\r\nRaymon, you do not know God; or rather let me repeat what Ralph said to\r\nyou one day at Lagny: you believe in nothing. Your education and your\r\ncraving for an irresistible power to oppose to the brute force of the\r\npeople, have led you to adopt without scrutiny the beliefs of your\r\nfathers; but the conviction of God\'s existence has never reached your\r\nheart--I doubt if you have ever prayed to Him. For my part, I have but\r\none belief, the only one probably that you have not: I believe in Him;\r\nbut the religion you have devised I will have nothing to do with; all\r\nyour morality, all your principles, are simply the interests of your\r\nsocial order which you have raised to the dignity of laws and which you\r\nclaim to trace back to God himself, just as your priests instituted the\r\nrites and ceremonies of the church to establish their power over the\r\nnations and amass wealth. But it is all falsehood and impiety. I, who\r\ninvoke God and understand Him, know that there is nothing in common\r\nbetween Him and you, and that by clinging to Him with all my strength I\r\nseparate myself from you, whose constant aim it is to overthrow His\r\nworks and sully His gifts. I tell you, it ill becomes you to invoke His\r\nname to crush the resistance of a poor, weak woman, to stifle the\r\nlamentations of a broken heart. God does not choose that the creations\r\nof His hands shall be oppressed and trodden under foot. If He vouchsafed\r\nto descend so far as to intervene in our paltry quarrels, He would crush\r\nthe strong and raise the weak; He would pass His mighty hand over our\r\nuneven heads and level them like the surface of the sea; He would say to\r\nthe slave: \'Cast off thy chains and fly to the mountains where I have\r\nplaced water and flowers and sunshine for thee.\' He would say to the\r\nkings: \'Throw your purple robes to the beggars to sit upon, and go to\r\nsleep in the valleys where I have spread for you carpets of moss and\r\nheather.\' To the powerful He would say: \'Bend your knees and bear the\r\nburdens of your weaker brethren; for henceforth you will need them and I\r\nwill give them strength and courage.\' Yes, those are my dreams; they are\r\nall of another life, of another world, where the laws of the brutal will\r\nnot have passed over the heads of the peaceably inclined; where\r\nresistance and flight will not be crimes; where man can escape man as\r\nthe gazelle escapes the panther; where the chain of the law will not be\r\nstretched about him to force him to throw himself under his enemy\'s\r\nfeet; and where the voice of prejudice will not be raised in his\r\ndistress to insult his sufferings and to say to him: \'You shall be\r\ndeemed cowardly and base because you did not bend the knee and crawl.\'\r\n\r\n"No, do not talk to me about God, you of all men, Raymon; do not invoke\r\nHis name to send me into exile and reduce me to silence. In submitting\r\nas I do I yield to the power of men. If I listened to the voice which\r\nGod has placed in the depths of my heart, and to the noble instinct of a\r\nbold and strong nature, which perhaps is the genuine conscience, I\r\nshould fly to the desert, I should learn to do without help, protection\r\nand love: I should go and live for myself in the heart of our beautiful\r\nmountains: I should forget the tyrants, the unjust and the ungrateful.\r\nBut alas! man cannot do without his fellowman, and even Ralph cannot\r\nlive alone.\r\n\r\n"Adieu, Raymon! may you be happy without me! I forgive you for the harm\r\nyou have done me. Talk of me sometimes to your mother, the best woman I\r\nhave ever known. Understand that there is neither anger nor vengeance in\r\nmy heart against you; my grief is worthy of the love I had for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n"INDIANA."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate creature was over-boastful. This profound and calm\r\nsorrow was due simply to a sense of what her own dignity demanded when\r\nshe addressed Raymon; but, when she was alone, she gave way freely to\r\nits consuming violence. Sometimes, however, a vague gleam of hope shone\r\nin her troubled eyes. Perhaps she never lost the last vestige of\r\nconfidence in Raymon\'s love, despite the cruel lessons of experience,\r\ndespite the distressing thoughts which placed before her mind every day\r\nhis indifference and indolence when his interests or his pleasures were\r\nnot concerned. It is my belief that, if Indiana could have persuaded\r\nherself to face the bald truth, she would not have dragged out her\r\nhopeless, ruined life so long.\r\n\r\nWoman is naturally foolish; it is as if Heaven, to counterbalance the\r\neminent superiority over us men which she owes to her delicacy of\r\nperception, had implanted a blind vanity, an idiotic credulity in her\r\nheart. It may be that one need only be an adept in the art of bestowing\r\npraise and flattering the self-esteem, to obtain dominion over that\r\nsubtle, supple and perspicacious being. Sometimes the men who are most\r\nincapable of obtaining any sort of ascendancy over other men, obtain an\r\nunbounded ascendancy over the minds of women. Flattery is the yoke that\r\nbends those ardent but frivolous heads so low. Woe to him who undertakes\r\nto be frank and outspoken in love! he will have Ralph\'s fate.\r\n\r\nThis is what I should reply if you should tell me that Indiana is an\r\nexceptional character, and that the ordinary woman displays neither her\r\nstoical coolness nor her exasperating patience in resistance to conjugal\r\ndespotism. I should tell you to look at the reverse of the medal, and\r\nsee the miserable weakness, the stupid blindness she displays in her\r\nrelations with Raymon. I should ask you where you ever found a woman who\r\nwas not as ready to deceive as to be deceived; who had not the art to\r\nconfine for ten years in the depths of her heart the secret of a hope\r\nsacrificed so thoughtlessly in a day of frenzied excitement, and who\r\nwould not become, in one man\'s arms, as pitiably weak as she could be\r\nstrong and invincible in another man\'s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Delmare\'s home had become more peaceable, however. With their\r\nfalse friends had disappeared many of the difficulties which, under the\r\nfostering hand of those officious meddlers, had been envenomed with all\r\nthe warmth of their zeal. Sir Ralph, with his silence and his apparent\r\nnon-interference, was more skilful than all of them in letting drop\r\nthose airy trifles of intimate companionship which float about in the\r\nfavoring breeze of pleasant gossip. But Indiana lived almost alone. Her\r\nhouse was in the mountains above the town, and Monsieur Delmare, who had\r\na warehouse in the port, went down every morning for the whole day, to\r\nsuperintend his business with the Indies and with France. Sir Ralph, who\r\nhad no other home than theirs, but who found ways to add to their\r\ncomfort without their suspecting his gifts, devoted himself to the study\r\nof natural history or to superintending the plantation; Indiana,\r\nresuming the easy-going habits of creole life, passed the scorching\r\nhours of the day in her straw chair, and the long evenings in the\r\nsolitude of the mountains.\r\n\r\nBourbon is in truth, simply a huge cone, the base of which is about\r\nforty leagues in circumference, while its gigantic mountain peaks rise\r\nto the height of ten thousand feet. From almost every part of that\r\nimposing mass, the eye can see in the distance, beyond the beetling\r\nrocks, beyond the narrow valleys and stately forests, the unbroken\r\nhorizon surrounding the azure-hued sea like a girdle. From her window,\r\nIndiana could see between the twin peaks of a wooded mountain opposite\r\nthat on which their house was built, the white sails on the Indian\r\nOcean. During the silent hours of the day, that spectacle attracted her\r\neyes and gave to her melancholy a fixed and uniform tinge of despair.\r\nThat splendid sight made her musings bitter and gloomy, instead of\r\ncasting its poetical influence upon them; and she would lower the\r\ncurtain that hung at her window and shun the very daylight, in order to\r\nshed bitter, scalding tears in the secrecy of her heart.\r\n\r\nBut when the land breeze began to blow, toward evening, and to bring to\r\nher nostrils the fragrance of the flowering rice-fields, she would go\r\nforth into the wilderness, leaving Delmare and Ralph on the veranda, to\r\nenjoy the aromatic infusion of the _faham_ and to loiter over their\r\ncigars. She would climb to the top of some accessible peak, the extinct\r\ncrater of a former volcano, and gaze at the setting sun as it kindled\r\nthe red vapors of the atmosphere into flame and spread a sort of dust of\r\ngold and rubies over the murmuring stalks of the sugar cane and the\r\nglistening walls of the cliff. She rarely went down into the gorges of\r\nthe St. Gilles River, because the sight of the sea, although it\r\ndistressed her, fascinated her with its magnetic mirage. It seemed to\r\nher that beyond those waves and that distant haze the magic apparition\r\nof another land would burst upon her gaze. Sometimes the clouds on the\r\nshore assumed strange forms in her eyes: at one time she would see a\r\nwhite wave rise upon the ocean and describe a gigantic line which she\r\ntook for the fa\xc3\xa7ade of the Louvre; again two square sails would emerge\r\nsuddenly from the mist and recall to her mind the towers of Notre-Dame\r\nat Paris, when the Seine sends up a dense mist which surrounds their\r\nfoundations and leaves them as if suspended in the sky; at other times\r\nthere were patches of pink clouds which, in their changing shapes,\r\nimitated all the caprices of architecture in a great city. That woman\'s\r\nmind slumbered in the illusions of the past, and she would quiver with\r\njoy at sight of that magnificent Paris, whose realities were connected\r\nwith the most unhappy period of her life. A curious sort of vertigo\r\nwould take possession of her brain. Standing at a great height above the\r\nshore, and watching the gorges that separated her from the ocean recede\r\nbefore her eyes, it seemed as if she were flying swiftly through space\r\ntoward the fascinating city of her imagination. Dreaming thus, she would\r\ncling to the rock against which she was leaning, and to one who had at\r\nsuch times seen her eager eyes, her bosom heaving with impatient longing\r\nand the horrifying expression of joy on her face, she would have seemed\r\nto manifest all the symptoms of madness. And yet those were her hours of\r\npleasure, the only moments of well-being to which she looked forward\r\nhopefully during the day. If her husband had taken it into his head to\r\nforbid these solitary walks, I do not know what thought she would have\r\nlived upon; for in her everything centred in a certain faculty of\r\ninventing allusions, in an eager striving toward a point which was\r\nneither memory, nor anticipation, nor hope, nor regret, but longing in\r\nall its devouring intensity. Thus she lived for weeks and months beneath\r\nthe tropical sky, recognizing, loving, caressing but one shade,\r\ncherishing but one chimera.\r\n\r\nRalph, for his part, was attracted to gloomy, secluded spots in his\r\nwalks, where the wind from the sea could not reach him; for the sight of\r\nthe ocean had become as antipathetic to him as the thought of crossing\r\nit again. France held only an accursed place in his heart\'s memory.\r\nThere it was that he had been unhappy to the point of losing courage,\r\naccustomed as he was to unhappiness and patient with his misery. He\r\nstrove with all his might to forget it; for, although he was intensely\r\ndisgusted with life, he wished to live as long as he should feel that he\r\nwas necessary. He was very careful therefore never to utter a word\r\nrelating to the time he had passed in that country. What would he not\r\nhave given to tear that ghastly memory from Madame Delmare\'s mind! But\r\nhe had so little confidence of his ability, he felt that he was so\r\nawkward, so lacking in eloquence, that he avoided her instead of trying\r\nto divert her thoughts. In the excess of his delicate reserve, he\r\ncontinued to maintain the outward appearance of indifference and\r\nselfishness. He went off and suffered alone, and, to see him scouring\r\nwoods and mountains in pursuit of birds and insects, one would have\r\ntaken him for a naturalist sportsman engrossed by his innocent passion\r\nand utterly indifferent to the passions of the heart that were stirring\r\nin his neighborhood. And yet hunting and study were merely the pretext\r\nbehind which he concealed his long and bitter reveries.\r\n\r\nThis conical island is split at the base on all sides and conceals in\r\nits embrasures deep gorges through which flow pure and turbulent\r\nstreams. One of these gorges is called Bernica. It is a picturesque\r\nspot, a sort of deep and narrow valley, hidden between two perpendicular\r\nwalls of rock, the surface of which is studded with clumps of saxatile\r\nshrubs and tufts of ferns.\r\n\r\nA stream flows in the narrow trough formed by the meeting of the two\r\nsides. At the point where they meet it plunges down into frightful\r\ndepths, and, where it falls, forms a basin surrounded by reeds and\r\ncovered with a damp mist. Around its banks and along the edges of the\r\ntiny stream fed by the overflow of the basin grow bananas and oranges,\r\nwhose dark and healthy green clothe the inner walls of the gorge.\r\nThither Ralph fled to avoid the heat and companionship. All his walks\r\nled to that favorite goal; the cool, monotonous plash of the waterfall\r\nlulled his melancholy to sleep. When his heart was torn by the secret\r\nagony so long concealed, so cruelly misunderstood, it was there that he\r\nexpended in unknown tears, in silent lamentations, the useless energy of\r\nhis heart and the concentrated activity of his youth.\r\n\r\nIn order that you may understand Ralph\'s character, it will be well to\r\ntell you that at least half of his life had been passed in the depths of\r\nthat ravine. Thither he had gone, in his early childhood, to steel his\r\ncourage against the injustice with which he had been treated in his\r\nfamily. It was there that he had put forth all the energies of his soul\r\nto endure the destiny arbitrarily imposed upon him, and that he had\r\nacquired the habit of stoicism which he had carried to such a point that\r\nit had become a second nature to him. There too, in his youth, he had\r\ncarried little Indiana on his shoulders; he had laid her on the grass by\r\nthe stream while he fished in the clear water or tried to scale the\r\ncliff in search of birds\' nests.\r\n\r\nThe only dwellers in that solitude were the gulls, petrels, coots and\r\nsea-swallows. Those birds were incessantly flying up and down, hovering\r\noverhead or circling about, having chosen the holes and clefts in those\r\ninaccessible walls to rear their wild broods. Toward night they would\r\nassemble in restless groups and fill the echoing gorge with their\r\nhoarse, savage cries. Ralph liked to follow their majestic flight, to\r\nlisten to their melancholy voices. He taught his little pupil their\r\nnames and their habits; he showed her the lovely Madagascar teal, with\r\nits orange breast and emerald back; he bade her admire the flight of the\r\nred-winged tropic-bird, which sometimes strays to those regions and\r\nflies in a few hours from Mauritius to Rodrigues, whither, after a\r\njourney of two hundred leagues, it returns to sleep under the\r\n_veloutier_ in which its nest is hidden. The petrel, harbinger of the\r\ntempest, also spread its tapering wings over those cliffs; and the queen\r\nof the sea, the frigate-bird, with its forked tail, its slate-colored\r\ncoat and its jagged beak, which lights so rarely that it would seem that\r\nthe air is its country, and constant movement its nature, raised its cry\r\nof distress above all the rest. These wild inhabitants were apparently\r\naccustomed to seeing the two children playing about the dwellings, for\r\nthey hardly condescended to take fright at their approach; and when\r\nRalph reached the shelf on which they had installed their families, they\r\nwould rise in black clouds and light, as if in derision, a few feet\r\nabove him. Indiana would laugh at their evolutions, and would carry\r\nhome, carefully, in her hat of rice-straw, the eggs Ralph had succeeded\r\nin stealing for her, and for which he had often to fight stoutly against\r\npowerful blows from the wings of the great amphibious creatures.\r\n\r\nThese memories rushed tumultuously to Ralph\'s mind, but they were\r\nextremely bitter to him; for times had changed greatly, and the little\r\ngirl who had always been his companion had ceased to be his friend, or\r\nat all events was no longer his friend, as formerly, in absolute\r\nsimpleness of heart. Although she returned his affection, his devotion,\r\nhis regard, there was one thing which prevented any confidence between\r\nthem, one memory upon which all the emotions of their lives turned as\r\nupon a pivot. Ralph felt that he could not refer to it; he had ventured\r\nto do it once, on a day of danger, and his bold act had availed nothing.\r\nTo recur to it now would be nothing more than cold-blooded barbarity,\r\nand Ralph had made up his mind to forgive Raymon, the man for whom he\r\nhad less esteem than for any man on earth, rather than add to Indiana\'s\r\nsorrow by condemning him according to his own ideas of what justice\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nSo he held his peace and even avoided her. Although living under the\r\nsame roof, he had managed so that he hardly saw her except at meals; and\r\nyet he watched over her like a mysterious providence. He left the house\r\nonly when the heat confined her to her hammock; but at night, when she\r\nhad gone out, he would invent an excuse for leaving Delmare on the\r\nveranda and would go and wait for her at the foot of the cliffs where he\r\nknew she was in the habit of sitting. He would remain there whole hours,\r\nsometimes gazing at her through the branches upon which the moon cast\r\nits white light, but respecting the narrow space which separated them,\r\nand never venturing to shorten her sad reverie by an instant. When she\r\ncame down into the valley she always found him on the edge of a little\r\nstream along which ran the path to the house. Several broad flat stones,\r\naround which the water rippled in silver threads, served him as a seat.\r\nWhen Indiana\'s white dress appeared on the bank, Ralph would rise\r\nsilently, offer her his arm and take her back to the house without\r\nspeaking to her, unless Indiana, being more discouraged and depressed\r\nthan usual, herself opened the conversation. Then, when he had left her,\r\nhe would go to his own room and wait until the whole house was asleep\r\nbefore going to bed. If he heard Delmare scolding, Ralph would grasp the\r\nfirst pretext that came to his mind to go to him, and would succeed in\r\npacifying him or diverting his thoughts without ever allowing him to\r\nsuspect that such was his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the house, which was transparent, so to speak,\r\ncompared with the houses in our climate, and the consequent necessity of\r\nbeing always under the eyes of everybody else, compelled the colonel to\r\nput more restraint upon his temper. Ralph\'s inevitable appearance, at\r\nthe slightest sound, to stand between him and his wife, forced him to\r\nkeep a check upon himself; for Delmare had sufficient self-esteem to\r\nretain control of himself before that acute but stern censor. And so he\r\nwaited until the hour for retiring had delivered him from his judge\r\nbefore venting the ill-humor which business vexations had heaped up\r\nduring the day. But it was of no avail; the secret influence kept vigil\r\nwith him, and, at the first harsh word, at the first loud tone that was\r\naudible through the thin partitions, the sound of moving furniture or of\r\nsomebody walking about, as if by accident, in Ralph\'s room, seemed to\r\nimpose silence on him and to warn him that the silent and patient\r\nsolicitude of Indiana\'s protector was not asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOURTH\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it happened that the ministry of the 8th of August, which overturned\r\nso many things in France, dealt a serious blow at Raymon\'s security.\r\nMonsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re was not one of those blindly vain mortals who\r\ntriumph on a day of victory. He had made politics the mainspring of all\r\nhis ideas, the basis of all his dreams of the future. He had flattered\r\nhimself that the king, by adopting a policy of shrewd concessions, would\r\nmaintain for a long time to come the equilibrium which assured the\r\nexistence of the noble families. But the rise to power of the Prince de\r\nPolignac destroyed that hope. Raymon saw too far ahead, he was too well\r\nacquainted with the new society not to stand on his guard against\r\nmomentary triumphs. He understood that his whole future trembled in the\r\nbalance with that of the monarchy, and that his fortune, perhaps his\r\nlife, hung by a thread.\r\n\r\nThereupon he found himself in a delicate and embarrassing position.\r\nHonor made it his duty to devote himself, despite all the risks of such\r\ndevotion, to the family whose interests had been thus far closely\r\nconnected with his own. In that respect he could hardly disregard his\r\nconscience and the memory of his forefathers. But this new order of\r\nthings, this tendency toward an absolute despotism, offended his\r\nprudence, his common-sense, and, so he said, his convictions. It\r\ncompromised his whole existence, it did worse than that, it made him\r\nridiculous, him, a renowned publicist who had ventured so many times to\r\npromise, in the name of the crown, justice for all and fidelity to the\r\nsworn compact. But now all the acts of the government gave a formal\r\ncontradiction to the young eclectic politician\'s imprudent assertions;\r\nall the calm and slothful minds who, two days earlier, asked nothing\r\nbetter than to cling to the constitutional throne, began to throw\r\nthemselves into the opposition and to denounce as rascality the efforts\r\nof Raymon and his fellows. The most courteous accused him of lack of\r\nforesight and incapacity. Raymon felt that it was humiliating to be\r\nconsidered a dupe after playing such a brilliant r\xc3\xb4le in the game. He\r\nbegan secretly to curse and despise this royalty which thus degraded\r\nitself and involved him in its downfall; he would have liked to be able\r\nto cut loose from it without disgrace before the hour of battle. For\r\nsome time he made incredible efforts to gain the confidence of both\r\ncamps. The opposition ranks of that period were not squeamish concerning\r\nthe admission of new recruits. They needed them, and the credentials\r\nthey required were so trivial, that they enlisted considerable numbers.\r\nNor did they disdain the support of great names, and day after day\r\nadroitly flattering allusions in their newspapers tended to detach the\r\nbrightest gems from that worn-out crown. Raymon was not deceived by\r\nthese demonstrations of esteem; but he did not reject them, for he was\r\ncertain of their utility. On the other hand, the champions of the throne\r\nbecame more intolerant as their situation became more desperate. They\r\ndrove from their ranks, without prudence and without regard for\r\npropriety, their strongest defenders. They soon began to manifest their\r\ndissatisfaction and distrust to Raymon. He, in his embarrassment,\r\nattached to his reputation as the principal ornament of his existence,\r\nwas very opportunely taken down with an acute attack of rheumatism,\r\nwhich compelled him to abandon work of every sort for the moment and to\r\ngo into the country with his mother.\r\n\r\nIn his isolation Raymon really suffered to feel that he was like a\r\ncorpse amid the devouring activity of a society on the brink of\r\ndissolution, to feel that he was prevented, by his embarrassment as to\r\nthe color he should assume no less than by illness, from enlisting under\r\nthe warlike banners that waved on all sides, summoning the most obscure\r\nand the least experienced to the great conflict. The intense pains of\r\nhis malady, solitude, ennui and fever insensibly turned his ideas into\r\nanother channel. He asked himself, for the first time, perhaps, if\r\nsociety had deserved all the pains he had taken to make himself\r\nagreeable to it, and he judged society justly when he saw that it was so\r\nindifferent with regard to him, so forgetful of his talents and his\r\nglory. Then he took comfort for having been its dupe by assuring himself\r\nthat he had never sought anything but his personal gratification; and\r\nthat he had found it there, thanks to himself. Nothing so confirms us in\r\negotism as reflection. Raymon drew this conclusion from it: that man, in\r\nthe social state, requires two sorts of happiness, happiness in public\r\nlife and in private life, social triumphs and domestic joys.\r\n\r\nHis mother, who nursed him assiduously, fell dangerously ill; it was his\r\nturn to forget his own sufferings and to take care of her; but his\r\nstrength was not sufficient. Ardent, passionate souls display miraculous\r\nstores of health in times of danger; but lukewarm, indolent souls do not\r\narouse such supernatural outbursts of bodily strength. Although Raymon\r\nwas a good son, as the phrase is understood in society, he succumbed\r\nphysically under the weight of fatigue. Lying on his bed of pain, with\r\nno one at his pillow save hirelings and now and then a friend who was in\r\nhaste to return to the excitements of social life, he began to think of\r\nIndiana, and he sincerely regretted her, for at that time she would have\r\nbeen most useful to him. He remembered the dutiful attentions she had\r\nlavished on her crabbed old husband and he imagined the gentle and\r\nbeneficent care with which she would have encompassed her lover.\r\n\r\n"If I had accepted her sacrifice," he thought, "she would be dishonored;\r\nbut what would it matter to me now? Abandoned as I am by a frivolous,\r\nselfish world, I should not be alone; she whom everybody spurned with\r\ncontumely would be at my feet, impelled by love; she would weep over my\r\nsufferings and would find a way to allay them. Why did I discard that\r\nwoman? She loved me so dearly that she would have found consolation for\r\nthe insults of her fellows by bringing a little happiness into my\r\ndomestic life."\r\n\r\nHe determined to marry when he recovered, and he mentally reviewed the\r\nnames and faces that had impressed him in the salons of the two\r\ndivisions of society. Fascinating apparitions flitted through his\r\ndreams; head-dresses laden with flowers, snowy shoulders enveloped in\r\nswansdown capes, supple forms imprisoned in muslin or satin: such\r\nalluring phantoms fluttered their gauze wings before Raymon\'s heavy,\r\nburning eyes; but he had seen these peris only in the perfumed whirl of\r\nthe ballroom. On waking, he asked himself whether their rosy lips knew\r\nany other smiles than those of coquetry; whether their white hands could\r\ndress the wounds of sorrow; whether their refined and brilliant wit\r\ncould stoop to the painful task of consoling and diverting a horribly\r\nbored invalid. Raymon was a man of keen intelligence and he was more\r\ndistrustful than other men of the coquetry of women; he had a more\r\nintense hatred of selfishness because he knew that from a selfish person\r\nhe could obtain nothing to advance his own happiness. And then Raymon\r\nwas no less embarrassed concerning the choice of a wife than concerning\r\nthe choice of his political colors. The same reasons imposed moderation\r\nand prudence on him. He belonged to a family of high rank and unbending\r\npride which would brook no m\xc3\xa9salliance, and yet wealth could no longer\r\nbe considered secure except in plebeian hands. According to all\r\nappearance that class was destined to rise over the ruins of the other,\r\nand in order to maintain oneself on the surface of the movement one must\r\nbe the son-in-law of a manufacturer or a stock-broker. Raymon concluded\r\ntherefore that it would be wise to wait and see which way the wind blew\r\nbefore entering upon a course of action which would decide his whole\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThese positive reflections made plain to him the utter lack of affection\r\nwhich characterizes marriages of convenience, so-called, and the hope of\r\nhaving some day a companion worthy of his love entered only incidentally\r\ninto his prospects of happiness. Meanwhile his illness might be\r\nprolonged, and the hope of better days to come does not efface the keen\r\nconsciousness of present pains. He recurred to the unpleasant thought of\r\nhis blindness on the day he had declined to kidnap Madame Delmare, and\r\nhe cursed himself for having comprehended so imperfectly his real\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture he received the letter Indiana wrote him from Ile\r\nBourbon. The sombre and inflexible energy which she retained, amid\r\nshocks which might well have crushed her spirit, made a profound\r\nimpression on Raymon.\r\n\r\n"I judged her ill," he thought; "she really loved me, she still loves\r\nme; for my sake she would have been capable of those heroic efforts\r\nwhich I considered to be beyond a woman\'s strength; and now I probably\r\nneed say but a word to draw her, like an irresistible magnet, from one\r\nend of the world to the other. If six months, eight months, perhaps,\r\nwere not necessary to obtain that result, I would like to make the\r\ntrial!"\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep meditating that idea: but he was soon awakened by a great\r\ncommotion in the next room. He rose with difficulty, put on a\r\ndressing-gown, and dragged himself to his mother\'s apartment. She was\r\nvery ill.\r\n\r\nToward morning she found strength to talk with him; she was under no\r\nillusion as to the brief time she had yet to live and her mind was busy\r\nwith her son\'s future.\r\n\r\n"You are about to lose your best friend," she said; "may Heaven replace\r\nher by a companion worthy of you! But be prudent, Raymon, and do not\r\nrisk the repose of your whole life for a mere chimera of your ambition.\r\nI have known but one woman, alas! whom I should have cared to call my\r\ndaughter; but Heaven has disposed of her. But listen, my son. Monsieur\r\nDelmare is old and broken; who knows if that long voyage did not exhaust\r\nthe rest of his vitality? Respect his wife as long as he lives; but if,\r\nas I believe will be the case, he is summoned soon to follow me to the\r\ngrave, remember there is still one woman in the world who loves you\r\nalmost as dearly as your mother loved you."\r\n\r\nThat evening Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re died in her son\'s arms. Raymon\'s grief\r\nwas deep and bitter; in the face of such a loss there could be neither\r\nfalse emotion nor selfish scheming. His mother was really necessary to\r\nhim; with her he lost all the moral comfort of his life. He shed\r\ndespairing tears upon her pallid forehead, her lifeless eyes. He\r\nmaligned Heaven, he cursed his destiny, he wept for Indiana. He called\r\nGod to account for the happiness He owed him. He reproached Him for\r\ntreating him like other men and tearing everything from him at once.\r\nThen he doubted the existence of this God who chastised him; he chose to\r\ndeny Him rather than submit to His decrees. He lost all the illusions\r\nwith all the realities of life; and he returned to his bed of fever and\r\nsuffering, as crushed and hopeless as a deposed king, as a fallen angel.\r\n\r\nWhen he was nearly restored to health, he cast a glance at the condition\r\nof France. Matters were going from bad to worse; on all sides there were\r\nthreats of refusal to pay taxes. Raymon was amazed at the foolish\r\nconfidence of his party, and deeming it wise not to plunge into the\r\nm\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e as yet, he shut himself up at Cercy with the melancholy memory\r\nof his mother and Madame Delmare.\r\n\r\nBy dint of pondering the idea to which he had attached little importance\r\nat its first conception, he accustomed himself to the thought that\r\nIndiana was not lost to him, if he chose to take the trouble to beckon\r\nher back. He detected many inconveniences in the scheme but many more\r\nadvantages. It was not in accord with his interest to wait until she was\r\na widow before marrying her, as Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re had suggested.\r\nDelmare might live twenty years longer, and Raymon did not choose to\r\nrenounce forever the chance of a brilliant marriage. He conceived a\r\nbetter plan than that in his cheerful and fertile imagination. He could,\r\nby taking a little trouble, exert an unbounded influence over his\r\nIndiana; he felt that he possessed sufficient mental cunning and knavery\r\nto make of that enthusiastic and sublime creature a devoted and\r\nsubmissive mistress. He could shield her from the ferocity of public\r\nopinion, conceal her behind the impenetrable wall of his private life,\r\nkeep her as a precious treasure in the depths of his retreat, and employ\r\nher to sweeten his moments of solitude and meditation with the joys of a\r\npure and generous affection. He would not have to exert himself overmuch\r\nto escape the husband\'s wrath; he would not come three thousand leagues\r\nin pursuit of his wife when his business interests made his presence\r\nabsolutely necessary in the other hemisphere. Indiana would demand\r\nlittle in the way of pleasure and liberty after the bitter trials which\r\nhad bent her neck to the yoke. She was ambitious only for love, and\r\nRaymon felt that he would love her from gratitude as soon as she made\r\nherself useful to him. He remembered also the constancy and gentleness\r\nshe had shown during the long days of his coldness and neglect. He\r\npromised himself that he would cleverly retain his liberty, so that she\r\nwould not dare to complain. He flattered himself that he could acquire\r\nsufficient control over her convictions to make her consent to anything,\r\neven to his marriage; and he based that hope upon numerous examples of\r\nsecret liaisons which he had known to continue despite the laws of\r\nsociety, by virtue of the prudence and skill with which the parties had\r\nsucceeded in avoiding the judgment of public opinion.\r\n\r\n"Besides," he said to himself, "that woman will have made an\r\nirrevocable, boundless sacrifice for me. She will have travelled the\r\nworld over for me and have left behind her all means of existence--all\r\npossibility of pardon. Society is stern and unforgiving only to paltry,\r\ncommonplace faults. Uncommon audacity takes it by surprise, notorious\r\nmisfortune disarms it; it will pity, perhaps admire this woman who will\r\nhave done for me what no other woman would have dared to try. It will\r\nblame her, but it will not laugh at her, and I shall not be blamed for\r\ntaking her in and protecting her after such a signal proof of her love.\r\nPerhaps, on the contrary, my courage will be extolled, at all events I\r\nshall have defenders, and my reputation will undergo a glorious and\r\nindecisive trial. Society likes to be defied sometimes; it does not\r\naccord its admiration to those who crawl along the beaten paths. In\r\nthese days public opinion must be driven with a whip."\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these thoughts he wrote to Madame Delmare. His\r\nletter was what it was sure to be from the pen of so adroit and\r\nexperienced a man. It breathed love, grief, and, above all, truth. Alas!\r\nwhat a slender reed the truth is, to bend thus with every breath!\r\n\r\nHowever, Raymon was wise enough not to express the object of his letter\r\nin so many words. He pretended to look upon Indiana\'s return as a joy of\r\nwhich he had no hope; but he had but little to say of her duty. He\r\nrepeated his mother\'s last words; he described with much warmth the\r\nstate of despair to which his loss had reduced him, the ennui of\r\nsolitude and the danger of his position politically. He drew a dismal\r\nand terrifying picture of the revolution that was rising above the\r\nhorizon, and, while feigning to rejoice that he was to meet its coming\r\nalone, he gave Indiana to understand that the moment had come for her to\r\nmanifest that enthusiastic loyalty, that perilous devotion of which she\r\nhad boasted so confidently. He cursed his destiny and said that virtue\r\nhad cost him very dear, that his yoke was very heavy: that he had held\r\nhappiness in his hand and had had the strength of will to doom himself\r\nto eternal solitude.\r\n\r\n"Do not tell me again that you once loved me," he added; "I am so weak\r\nand discouraged that I curse my courage and hate my duties. Tell me that\r\nyou are happy, that you have forgotten me, so that I may have strength\r\nnot to come and tear you away from the bonds that keep you from me."\r\n\r\nIn a word, he said that he was unhappy; that was equivalent to telling\r\nIndiana that he expected her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the three months that elapsed between the despatch of this letter\r\nand its arrival at Ile Bourbon, Madame Delmare\'s situation had become\r\nalmost intolerable, as the result of a domestic incident of the greatest\r\nimportance to her. She had adopted the depressing habit of writing down\r\nevery evening a narrative of the sorrowful thoughts of the day. This\r\njournal of her sufferings was addressed to Raymon, and, although she had\r\nno intention of sending it to him, she talked with him, sometimes\r\npassionately, sometimes bitterly, of the misery of her life and of the\r\nsentiments which she could not overcome. These papers fell into\r\nDelmare\'s hands, that is to say, he broke open the box which contained\r\nthem as well as Raymon\'s letters, and devoured them with a jealous,\r\nfrenzied eye. In the first outbreak of his wrath he lost the power to\r\nrestrain himself and went outside, with fast-beating heart and clenched\r\nfists, to await her return from her walk. Perhaps, if she had been a few\r\nminutes later, the unhappy man would have had time to recover himself;\r\nbut their evil star decreed that she should appear before him almost\r\nimmediately. Thereupon, unable to utter a word, he seized her by the\r\nhair, threw her down and stamped on her forehead with his heel.\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner made that bloody mark of his brutal nature upon a poor,\r\nweak creature, than he was horrified at what he had done. He fled in\r\ndire dismay, and locked himself in his room, where he cocked his pistol\r\npreparatory to blowing out his brains; but as he was about to pull the\r\ntrigger he looked out on the veranda and saw that Indiana had risen and,\r\nwith a calm, self-possessed air, was wiping away the blood that covered\r\nher face. As he thought that he had killed her, his first feeling was of\r\njoy when he saw her on her feet; then his wrath blazed up anew.\r\n\r\n"It is only a scratch," he cried, "and you deserve a thousand deaths!\r\nNo, I will not kill myself; for then you would go and rejoice over it in\r\nyour lover\'s arms. I do not propose to assure the happiness of both of\r\nyou; I propose to live to make you suffer, to see you die by inches of\r\ndeathly ennui, to dishonor the infamous creature who has made a fool of\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nHe was battling with the tortures of jealous rage, when Ralph entered\r\nthe veranda by another door and found Indiana in the dishevelled\r\ncondition in which that horrible scene had left her. But she had not\r\nmanifested the slightest alarm, she had not uttered a cry, she had not\r\nraised her hand to ask for mercy. Weary of life as she was, it seemed\r\nthat she had been desirous to give Delmare time to commit murder by\r\nrefraining from calling for help. It is certain that when the assault\r\ntook place Ralph was within twenty yards, and that he had not heard the\r\nslightest sound.\r\n\r\n"Indiana!" he cried, recoiling in horror and surprise; "who has wounded\r\nyou thus?"\r\n\r\n"Do you ask?" she replied with a bitter smile; "what other than _your\r\nfriend_ has the _right_ and the inclination?"\r\n\r\nRalph dropped the cane he held; he needed no other weapons than his\r\ngreat hands to strangle Delmare. He reached his door in two leaps and\r\nburst it open with his fist. But he found Delmare lying on the floor,\r\nwith purple cheeks and swollen throat, struggling in the noiseless\r\nconvulsions of apoplexy.\r\n\r\nHe seized the papers that were scattered over the floor. When he\r\nrecognized Raymon\'s handwriting and saw the ruins of the letter-box, he\r\nunderstood what had happened; and, carefully collecting the accusing\r\ndocuments, he hastened to hand them to Madame Delmare and urged her to\r\nburn them at once. Delmare had probably not taken time to read them all.\r\n\r\nThen he begged her to go to her room while he summoned the slaves to\r\nlook after the colonel; but she would neither burn the papers nor hide\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\n"No," she said haughtily, "I will not do it! That man did not scruple to\r\ntell Madame de Carvajal of my flight long ago; he made haste to publish\r\nwhat he called my dishonor. I propose to show to everybody this token of\r\nhis own dishonor which he has taken pains to stamp on my face. It is a\r\nstrange sort of justice that requires one to keep secret another\'s\r\ncrimes, when that other assumes the right to brand one without mercy!"\r\n\r\nWhen Ralph found the colonel was in a condition to listen to him, he\r\nheaped reproaches upon him with more energy and severity than one would\r\nhave thought him capable of exhibiting. Thereupon Delmare, who certainly\r\nwas not an evil-minded man, wept like a child over what he had done; but\r\nhe wept without dignity, as a man can do when he abandons himself to the\r\nsensation of the moment, without reasoning as to its causes and effects.\r\nPrompt to jump to the opposite extreme, he would have called his wife\r\nand solicited her pardon; but Ralph objected and tried to make him\r\nunderstand that such a puerile reconciliation would impair the authority\r\nof one without wiping out the injury done to the other. He was well\r\naware that there are injuries which are never forgiven and miseries\r\nwhich one can never forget.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, the husband\'s personality became hateful in the wife\'s\r\neyes. All that he did to atone for his treatment of her deprived him of\r\nthe slight consideration he had retained thus far. He had in very truth\r\nmade a tremendous mistake; the man who does not feel strong enough to be\r\ncold and implacable in his vengeance should abjure all thought of\r\nimpatience or resentment. There is no possible r\xc3\xb4le between that of the\r\nChristian who forgives and that of the man of the world who spurns. But\r\nDelmare had his share of selfishness too; he felt that he was growing\r\nold, that his wife\'s care was becoming more necessary to him every day.\r\nHe was terribly afraid of solitude, and if, in the paroxysm of his\r\nwounded pride, he recurred to his habits as a soldier and maltreated\r\nher, reflection soon led him back to the characteristic weakness of old\r\nmen, whom the thought of desertion terrifies. Too enfeebled by age and\r\nhardships to aspire to become a father, he had remained an old bachelor\r\nin his home, and had taken a wife as he would have taken a housekeeper.\r\nIt was not from affection for her, therefore, that he forgave her for\r\nnot loving him, but from regard for his own comfort: and if he grieved\r\nat his failure to command her affections, it was because he was afraid\r\nthat he should be less carefully tended in his old age.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Delmare, for her part, being deeply aggrieved by the\r\noperation of the laws of society, summoned all her strength of mind to\r\nhate and despise them, there was a wholly personal feeling at the bottom\r\nof her thoughts. But it may be that this craving for happiness which\r\nconsumes us, this hatred of injustice, this thirst for liberty which\r\nends only with life, are the constituent elements of _egotism_, a name\r\nby which the English designate love of self, considered as one of the\r\nprivileges of mankind and not as a vice. It seems to me that the\r\nindividual who is selected out of all the rest to suffer from the\r\nworking of institutions that are advantageous to his fellowmen ought, if\r\nhe has the least energy in his soul, to struggle against this arbitrary\r\nyoke. I also think that the greater and more noble his soul is, the more\r\nit should rankle and fester under the blows of injustice. If he has ever\r\ndreamed that happiness was to be the reward of virtue, into what ghastly\r\ndoubts, what desperate perplexity must he be cast by the disappointments\r\nwhich experience brings!\r\n\r\nThus all Indiana\'s reflections, all her acts, all her sorrows were a\r\npart of this great and terrible struggle between nature and\r\ncivilization. If the desert mountains of the island could have concealed\r\nher long, she would assuredly have taken refuge among them on the day of\r\nthe assault upon her; but Bourbon was not of sufficient extent to afford\r\nher a secure hiding-place, and she determined to place the sea and\r\nuncertainty as to her place of refuge between her tyrant and herself.\r\nWhen she had formed this resolution, she felt more at ease and was\r\nalmost gay and unconcerned at home. Delmare was so surprised and\r\ndelighted that he indulged apart in this brutal reasoning: that it was a\r\ngood thing to make women feel the law of the strongest now and then.\r\n\r\nThereafter she thought of nothing but flight, solitude and independence;\r\nshe considered in her tortured, grief-stricken brain innumerable plans\r\nof a romantic establishment in the deserts of India or Africa. At night\r\nshe followed the flight of the birds to their resting-place at Ile\r\nRodrigue. That deserted island promised her all the pleasures of\r\nsolitude, the first craving of a broken heart. But the same reasons that\r\nprevented her from flying to the interior of Bourbon caused her to\r\nabandon the idea of seeking refuge in the small islands near by. She\r\noften met at the house tradesmen from Madagascar, who had business\r\nrelations with her husband; dull, vulgar, copper-colored fellows who had\r\nno tact or shrewdness except in forwarding their business interests.\r\nTheir stories attracted Madame Delmare\'s attention, none the less; she\r\nenjoyed questioning them concerning the marvelous products of that\r\nisland, and what they told her of the prodigies performed by nature\r\nthere intensified more and more the desire that she felt to go and hide\r\nherself away there. The size of the island and the fact that Europeans\r\noccupied so small a portion of it led her to hope that she would never\r\nbe discovered. She decided upon that place, therefore, and fed her idle\r\nmind upon dreams of a future which she proposed to create for herself,\r\nunassisted. She was already building her solitary cabin under the shade\r\nof a primeval forest, on the bank of a nameless river; she fancied\r\nherself taking refuge under the protection of those savage tribes whom\r\nthe yoke of our laws and our prejudices has not debased. Ignorant\r\ncreature that she was, she hoped to find there the virtues that are\r\nbanished from our hemisphere, and to live in peace, unvexed by any\r\nsocial constitution; she imagined that she could avoid the dangers of\r\nisolation, escape the malignant diseases of the climate. A weak woman,\r\nwho could not endure the anger of one man, but flattered herself that\r\nshe could defy the hardships of uncivilized life!\r\n\r\nAmid these romantic thoughts and extravagant plans she forgot her\r\npresent ills; she made for herself a world apart, which consoled her for\r\nthat in which she was compelled to live; she accustomed herself to think\r\nless of Raymon, who was soon to cease to be a part of her solitary and\r\nphilosophical existence. She was so busily occupied in constructing for\r\nherself a future according to her fancy that she let the past rest a\r\nlittle; and already, as she felt that her heart was freer and braver,\r\nshe imagined that she was reaping in advance the fruits of her solitary\r\nlife. But Raymon\'s letter arrived, and that edifice of chimeras vanished\r\nlike a breath. She felt, or fancied that she felt, that she loved him\r\nmore than before. For my part, I like to think that she never loved him\r\nwith all the strength of her soul. It seems to me that misplaced\r\naffection is as different from requited affection as an error from the\r\ntruth. It seems to me that, although the excitement and ardor of our\r\nsentiments abuse us to the point of believing that that is love in all\r\nits power, we learn later, when we taste the delights of a true love,\r\nhow entirely we deceived ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut Raymon\'s situation, as he described it, rekindled in Indiana\'s heart\r\nthat generous flame which was a necessity of her nature. Fancying him\r\nalone and unhappy, she considered it her duty to forget the past and not\r\nto anticipate the future. A few hours earlier, she intended to leave her\r\nhusband under the spur of hatred and resentment; now, she regretted that\r\nshe did not esteem him so that she might make a real sacrifice for\r\nRaymon\'s sake. So great was her enthusiasm that she feared that she was\r\ndoing too little for him in fleeing from an irascible master at the\r\nperil of her life, and subjecting herself to the miseries of a four\r\nmonths\' voyage. She would have given her life, with the idea that it was\r\ntoo small a price to pay for a smile from Raymon. Women are made that\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThus it was simply a question of leaving the island. It was very\r\ndifficult to elude Delmare\'s distrust and Ralph\'s clear-sightedness. But\r\nthose were not the principal obstacles; it was necessary to avoid giving\r\nthe notice of her proposed departure, which, according to law, every\r\npassenger is compelled to give through the newspapers.\r\n\r\nAmong the few vessels lying in the dangerous roadstead of Bourbon was\r\nthe ship _Eug\xc3\xa8ne_, soon to sail for Europe. For a long while Indiana\r\nsought an opportunity to speak with the captain without her husband\'s\r\nknowledge, but whenever she expressed a wish to walk down to the port,\r\nhe ostentatiously placed her in Ralph\'s charge, and followed them with\r\nhis own eyes with maddening persistence. However, by dint of picking up\r\nwith the greatest care every scrap of information favorable to her plan,\r\nIndiana learned that the captain of the vessel bound for France had a\r\nkinswoman at the village of Saline in the interior of the island, and\r\nthat he often returned from her house on foot, to sleep on board. From\r\nthat moment she hardly left the cliff that served as her post of\r\nobservation. To avert suspicion, she went thither by roundabout paths,\r\nand returned in the same way at night when she had failed to discover\r\nthe person in whom she was interested on the road to the mountains.\r\n\r\nShe had but two days of hope remaining, for the land-wind had already\r\nbegun to blow. The anchorage threatened to become untenable, and Captain\r\nRandom was impatient to be at sea.\r\n\r\nHowever, she prayed earnestly to the God of the weak and oppressed, and\r\nwent and stationed herself on the very road to Saline, disregarding the\r\ndanger of being seen, and risking her last hope. She had not been\r\nwaiting an hour when Captain Random came down the path. He was a genuine\r\nsailor, always rough-spoken and cynical, whether he was in good or bad\r\nhumor; his expression froze Indiana\'s blood with terror. Nevertheless,\r\nshe mustered all her courage and walked to meet him with a dignified and\r\nresolute air.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur," she said, "I place my honor and my life in your hands. I\r\nwish to leave the colony and return to France. If, instead of granting\r\nme your protection, you betray the secret I confide to you, there is\r\nnothing left for me to do but throw myself into the sea."\r\n\r\nThe captain replied with an oath that the sea would refuse to sink such\r\na pretty lugger, and that, as she had come of her own accord and hove to\r\nunder his lee, he would promise to tow her to the end of the world.\r\n\r\n"You consent then, monsieur?" said Madame Delmare anxiously. "In that\r\ncase here is the pay for my passage in advance."\r\n\r\nAnd she handed him a casket containing the jewels Madame de Carvajal had\r\ngiven her long before; they were the only fortune that she still\r\npossessed. But the sailor had different ideas, and he returned the\r\ncasket with words that brought the blood to her cheeks.\r\n\r\n"I am very unfortunate, monsieur," she replied, restraining the tears of\r\nwrath that glistened behind her long lashes; "the proposition I am\r\nmaking to you justifies you in insulting me; and yet, if you knew how\r\nodious my life in this country is to me, you would have more pity than\r\ncontempt for me."\r\n\r\nIndiana\'s noble and touching countenance imposed respect on Captain\r\nRandom. Those who do not wear out their natural delicacy by over-use\r\nsometimes find it healthy and unimpaired in an emergency. He recalled\r\nColonel Delmare\'s unattractive features and the sensation that his\r\nattack on his wife had caused in the colonies. While ogling with a\r\nlustful eye that fragile, pretty creature, he was struck by her air of\r\ninnocence and sincerity. He was especially moved when he noticed on her\r\nforehead a white mark which the deep flush on her face brought out in\r\nbold relief. He had had some business relations with Delmare which had\r\nleft him ill-disposed toward him; he was so close-fisted and unyielding\r\nin business matters.\r\n\r\n"Damnation!" he cried, "I have nothing but contempt for a man who is\r\ncapable of kicking such a pretty woman in the face! Delmare\'s a pirate,\r\nand I am not sorry to play this trick on him; but be prudent, madame,\r\nand remember that I am compromising my good name. You must make your\r\nescape quietly when the moon has set, and fly like a poor petrel from\r\nthe foot of some sombre reef."\r\n\r\n"I know, monsieur," she replied, "that you cannot do me this very great\r\nfavor without transgressing the law; you may perhaps have to pay a fine;\r\nthat is why I offer you this casket, the contents of which are worth at\r\nleast twice the price of a passage."\r\n\r\nThe captain took the casket with a smile.\r\n\r\n"This is not the time to settle our account," he said; "I am willing to\r\ntake charge of your little fortune. Under the circumstances I suppose\r\nyou won\'t have very much luggage; on the night we are to sail, hide\r\namong the rocks at the _Anse aux Lataniers_; between one and two o\'clock\r\nin the morning a boat will come ashore pulled by two stout rowers, and\r\nbring you aboard."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day preceding her departure passed away like a dream. Indiana was\r\nafraid that it would be long and painful; it seemed to last but a\r\nmoment. The silence of the neighborhood, the peaceful tranquillity\r\nwithin the house were in striking contrast to the internal agitation by\r\nwhich Madame Delmare was consumed. She locked herself into her room to\r\nprepare the few clothes she intended to carry; then she concealed them\r\nunder her dress and carried them one by one to the rocks at the _Anse\r\naux Lataniers_, where she placed them in a bark basket and buried them\r\nin the sand. The sea was rough and the wind increased from hour to hour.\r\nAs a precautionary measure the _Eug\xc3\xa8ne_ had left the roadstead, and\r\nMadame Delmare could see in the distance her white sails bellied out by\r\nthe breeze, as she stood on and off, making short tacks, in order to\r\nhold the land. Her heart went out eagerly toward the vessel, which\r\nseemed to be pawing the air impatiently, like a race-horse, full of fire\r\nand ardor, as the word is about to be given. But when she returned to\r\nthe interior of the island she found in the mountain gorges a calm, soft\r\natmosphere, bright sunlight, the song of birds and humming of insects,\r\nand everything going on as on the day before, heedless of the intense\r\nemotions by which she was tortured. Then she could not believe in the\r\nreality of her situation, and wondered if her approaching departure were\r\nnot the illusion of a dream.\r\n\r\nToward night the wind fell. The _Eug\xc3\xa8ne_ approached the shore, and at\r\nsunset Madame Delmare on her rocky perch heard the report of a cannon\r\nechoing among the cliffs. It was the signal of departure on the\r\nfollowing day, on the return of the orb then sinking below the horizon.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Monsieur Delmare complained of not feeling well. His wife\r\nthought that her opportunity had gone, that he would keep the whole\r\nhouse awake all night, and that her plan would be defeated; and then he\r\nwas suffering, he needed her; that was not the moment to leave him.\r\nThereupon remorse entered her soul and she wondered who would have pity\r\non that old man when she had abandoned him. She shuddered at the thought\r\nthat she was about to commit what was a crime in her own eyes, and that\r\nthe voice of conscience would rise even louder than the voice of\r\nsociety, to condemn her. If Delmare, as usual, had harshly demanded her\r\nservices, if he had displayed an imperious and capricious spirit in his\r\nsufferings, resistance would have seemed natural and lawful to the\r\ndown-trodden slave; but, for the first time in his life, he submitted to\r\nthe pain with gentleness, and seemed grateful and affectionate to his\r\nwife. At ten o\'clock he declared that he felt entirely well, insisted\r\nthat she should go to her own room, and that no one should pay any\r\nfurther attention to him. Ralph, too, assured her that every symptom of\r\nillness had disappeared and that a quiet night\'s sleep was the only\r\nremedy that he needed.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock struck eleven all was silent and peaceful in the house.\r\nMadame Delmare fell on her knees and prayed, weeping bitterly; for she\r\nwas about to burden her heart with a grievous sin, and from God alone\r\ncould come such forgiveness as she could hope to receive. She stole\r\nsoftly into her husband\'s room. He was sleeping soundly; his features\r\nwere composed, his breathing regular. As she was about to withdraw, she\r\nnoticed in the shadows another person asleep in a chair. It was Ralph,\r\nwho had risen noiselessly and come to watch over her husband in his\r\nsleep, to guard against accident.\r\n\r\n"Poor Ralph!" thought Indiana; "what an eloquent and cruel reproach to\r\nme!"\r\n\r\nShe longed to wake him, to confess everything to him, to implore him to\r\nsave her from herself; and then she thought of Raymon.\r\n\r\n"One more sacrifice," she said to herself, "and the most cruel of\r\nall--the sacrifice of my duty."\r\n\r\nLove is woman\'s virtue; it is for love that she glories in her sins, it\r\nis from love that she acquires the heroism to defy her remorse. The more\r\ndearly it costs her to commit the crime, the more she will have deserved\r\nat the hands of the man she loves. It is like the fanaticism that places\r\nthe dagger in the hand of the religious enthusiast.\r\n\r\nShe took from her neck a gold chain which came to her from her mother\r\nand which she had always worn; she gently placed it around Ralph\'s neck,\r\nas the last pledge of an everlasting friendship, then lowered the lamp\r\nso that she could see her old husband\'s face once more, and make sure\r\nthat he was no longer ill. He was dreaming at that moment and said in a\r\nfaint, sad voice:\r\n\r\n"Beware of that man, he will ruin you."\r\n\r\nIndiana shuddered from head to foot and fled to her room. She wrung her\r\nhands in pitiable uncertainty; then suddenly seized upon the thought\r\nthat she was no longer acting in her own interest but in Raymon\'s; that\r\nshe was going to him, not in search of happiness, but to make him happy,\r\nand that, even though she were to be accursed for all eternity, she\r\nwould be sufficiently recompensed if she embellished her lover\'s life.\r\nShe rushed from the house and walked swiftly to the _Anse aux\r\nLataniers_, not daring to turn and look at what she left behind her.\r\n\r\nShe at once set about disinterring her bark basket and sat upon it,\r\ntrembling and silent, listening to the whistling of the wind, to the\r\nplashing of the waves as they died at her feet, and to the shrill\r\ngroaning of the _satanite_ among the great bunches of seaweed that clung\r\nto the steep sides of the cliffs; but all these noises were drowned by\r\nthe throbbing of her heart, which rang in her ears like a funeral knell.\r\n\r\nShe waited a long while; she looked at her watch and found that the\r\nappointed time had passed. The sea was so high, and navigation about the\r\nshores of the island is so difficult in the best of weather, that she\r\nwas beginning, to despair of the courage of the men who were to take her\r\naboard, when she spied on the gleaming waves the black shadow of a\r\n_pirogue_, trying to make the land. But the swell was so strong and the\r\nsea so rough that the frail craft constantly disappeared, burying itself\r\nas it were in the dark folds of a shroud studded with silver stars. She\r\nrose and answered their signal several times with cries which the wind\r\nwhisked away before carrying them to the ears of the oarsmen. At last,\r\nwhen they were near enough to hear her, they pulled toward her with much\r\ndifficulty; then paused to wait for a wave. As soon as they felt it\r\nraise the skiff they redoubled their efforts, and the wave broke and\r\nthrew them up on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe ground on which Saint-Paul is built is composed of sea sand and\r\ngravel from the mountains, which the Des Galets river brings from a long\r\ndistance from its mouth by the strength of its current. These heaps of\r\nrounded pebbles form submarine mountains near the shore which the waves\r\noverthrow and rebuild at their pleasure. Their constant shifting makes\r\nit impossible to avoid them, and the skill of the pilot is useless among\r\nthese constantly appearing and disappearing obstacles. Large vessels\r\nlying in the harbor of Saint-Denis often drag their anchors and are cast\r\non shore by the force of the currents; they have no other resource when\r\nthis off-shore wind begins to blow, and to make the turbulent receding\r\nwaves perilous, than to put to sea as quickly as possible, and that is\r\nwhat the _Eug\xc3\xa8ne_ had done.\r\n\r\nThe skiff bore Indiana and her fortunes amid the wild waves, the howling\r\nof the storm and the oaths of the two rowers, who had no hesitation in\r\ncursing loudly the danger to which they exposed themselves for her sake.\r\nTwo hours ago, they said, the ship should have been under way, and on\r\nher account the captain had obstinately refused to give the order. They\r\nadded divers insulting and cruel reflections, but the unhappy fugitive\r\nconsumed her shame in silence; and when one of them suggested to the\r\nother that they might be punished if they were lacking in the respect\r\nthey had been ordered to pay the _captain\'s mistress_:\r\n\r\n"Never you fear!" was the reply; "the sharks are the lads we\'ve got to\r\nsettle accounts with this night. If we ever see the captain again, I\r\ndon\'t believe he\'ll be any uglier than them."\r\n\r\n"Talking of sharks," said the first, "I don\'t know whether one of \'em\r\nhas got scent of us already, but I can see a face in our wake that don\'t\r\nbelong to a Christian."\r\n\r\n"You fool! to take a dog\'s face for a sea-wolf\'s! Hold! my four-legged\r\npassenger, we forgot you and left you on shore; but, blast my eyes, if\r\nyou shall eat up the ship\'s biscuit! Our orders only mentioned a young\r\nwoman, nothing was said about a cur----"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he raised his oar to hit the beast on the head; but Madame\r\nDelmare, casting her tearful, distraught eyes upon the sea, recognized\r\nher beautiful Ophelia, who had found her scent on the rocks and was\r\nswimming after her. As the sailor was about to strike her, the waves,\r\nagainst which she was struggling painfully, carried her away from the\r\nskiff, and her mistress heard her moaning with impatience and\r\nexhaustion. She begged the oarsmen to take her into the boat and they\r\npretended to comply; but, as the faithful beast approached, they dashed\r\nout her brains with loud shouts of laughter, and Indiana saw before her\r\nthe dead body of the creature who had loved her better than Raymon. At\r\nthe same time a huge wave drew the skiff down as it were into the depths\r\nof an abyss, and the laughter of the sailors changed to imprecations and\r\nyells of terror. However, thanks to its buoyancy and lightness the\r\n_pirogue_ righted itself like a duck and climbed to the summit of the\r\nwave, to plunge into another ravine and mount again to another foaming\r\ncrest. As they left the shore behind, the sea became less rough, and\r\nsoon the skiff flew along swiftly and without danger toward the ship.\r\nThereupon, the oarsmen recovered their good humor and with it the power\r\nof reflection. They strove to atone for their brutal treatment of\r\nIndiana; but their cajolery was more insulting than their anger.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, my young lady," said one of them, "take courage, you\'re\r\nsafe now; of course the captain will give us a glass of the best wine in\r\nthe locker for the pretty parcel we\'ve fished up for him."\r\n\r\nThe other affected to sympathize with the young lady because her clothes\r\nwere wet; but, he said, the captain was waiting for her and would take\r\ngood care of her. Indiana listened to their remarks in deadly terror,\r\nwithout speaking or moving; she realized the horror of her situation,\r\nand could see no other way of escaping the outrages which awaited her\r\nthan to throw herself into the sea. Two or three times she was on the\r\npoint of jumping out of the boat; but she recovered courage, a sublime\r\ncourage, with the thought:\r\n\r\n"It is for him, Raymon, that I suffer all these indignities. I must live\r\nthough I were crushed with shame!"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her oppressed heart and touched the hilt of a dagger\r\nwhich she had concealed there in the morning, with a sort of instinctive\r\nprevision of danger. The possession of that weapon restored all her\r\nconfidence; it was a short, pointed stiletto, which her father used to\r\ncarry; an old Spanish weapon which had belonged to a Medina-Sidonia,\r\nwhose name was cut on the blade, with the date 1300. Doubtless it had\r\nrusted in noble blood, had washed out more than one affront, punished\r\nmore than one insolent knave. With it in her possession, Indiana felt\r\nthat she became a Spaniard once more, and she went aboard the ship with\r\na resolute heart, saying to herself that a woman incurred no risk so\r\nlong as she had a sure means of taking her own life before submitting to\r\ndishonor. She avenged herself for the harsh treatment of her guides only\r\nby rewarding them handsomely for their fatigue; then she went to her\r\ncabin and anxiously awaited the hour of departure.\r\n\r\nAt last the day broke, and the sea was covered with small boats bringing\r\nthe passengers aboard. Indiana looked with terror through the port-hole\r\nat the faces of those who came aboard the _Eug\xc3\xa8ne_; she dreaded lest\r\nshe should see her husband, coming to claim her. At last the echoes of\r\nthe last gun died away on the island which had been her prison. The ship\r\nbegan to cut her way through the waves, and the sun, rising from the\r\nocean, cast its cheerful, rosy light on the white peaks of the Salazes\r\nas they sank lower and lower on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration 05: _MADAME DELMARE\'S FLIGHT_\r\n_She waited a long while; she looked at her watch\r\nand found that the appointed time had passed. The\r\nsea was so high, and navigation about the shores of\r\nthe island is so difficult in the best of weather, that\r\nshe was beginning, to despair of the courage of the\r\nmen who were to take her aboard, when she spied on\r\nthe gleaming waves the black shadow of a_ pirogue,\r\n_trying to make the land._]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they were a few leagues from port, a sort of comedy was played on\r\nboard to avoid a confession of trickery. Captain Random pretended to\r\ndiscover Madame Delmare on his vessel; he feigned surprise, questioned\r\nthe sailors, went through the form of losing his temper and of quieting\r\ndown again, and ended by drawing up a report of the finding of a\r\n_stowaway_ on board; that is the technical term used on such occasions.\r\n\r\nAllow me to go no farther with the story of this voyage. It will be\r\nenough for me to tell you, for Captain Random\'s justification, that,\r\ndespite his rough training, he had enough natural good sense to\r\nunderstand Madame Delmare\'s character very quickly; he ventured upon\r\nvery few attempts to abuse her unprotected condition and eventually was\r\ntouched by it and acted as her friend and protector. But that worthy\r\nman\'s loyal behavior and Indiana\'s dignity did not restrain the comments\r\nof the crew, the mocking glances, the insulting suspicions and the broad\r\nand stinging jests. These were the real torments of the unhappy woman\r\nduring that journey, for I say nothing of the fatigue, the discomforts,\r\nthe dangers, the tedium and the sea-sickness; she paid no heed to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after the despatch of his letter to Ile Bourbon, Raymon had\r\nentirely forgotten both the letter and its purpose. He had felt\r\ndecidedly better and had ventured to make a visit in the neighborhood.\r\nThe estate of Lagny, which Monsieur Delmare had left to be sold for the\r\nbenefit of his creditors, had been purchased by a wealthy manufacturer,\r\nMonsieur Hubert, a shrewd and estimable man, not like all wealthy\r\nmanufacturers, but like a small number of the newly-rich. Raymon found\r\nthe new owner comfortably settled in that house which recalled so many\r\nmemories. He took pleasure in giving a free rein to his emotion as he\r\nwandered through the garden where Noun\'s light footprints seemed to be\r\nstill visible on the gravel, and through those great rooms which seemed\r\nstill to retain the echoes of Indiana\'s soft words; but soon the\r\npresence of a new hostess changed the current of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn the main salon, on the spot where Madame Delmare was accustomed to\r\nsit and work, a tall, slender young woman, with a glance that was at\r\nonce pleasant and mischievous, caressing and mocking, sat before an\r\neasel, amusing herself by copying in water-colors the odd hangings on\r\nthe walls. The copy was a fascinating thing, a delicate satire instinct\r\nwith the bantering yet refined nature of the artist. She had amused\r\nherself by exaggerating the pretentious finicalness of the old frescoes;\r\nshe had grasped the false and shifting character of the age of Louis\r\nXIV. on those stilted figures. While refreshing the colors that time had\r\nfaded, she had restored their affected graces, their perfume of\r\ncourtiership, their costumes of the boudoir and the shepherd\'s hut, so\r\ncuriously identical. Beside that work of historical raillery she had\r\nwritten the word _copy._\r\n\r\nShe raised her long eyes, instinct with merriment of a caustic,\r\ntreacherous, yet attractive sort, slowly to Raymon\'s face. For some\r\nreason she reminded him of Shakespeare\'s Anne Page. There was in her\r\nmanner neither timidity nor boldness, nor affectation, nor\r\nself-distrust. Their conversation turned upon the influence of fashion\r\nin the arts.\r\n\r\n"Is it not true, monsieur, that the moral coloring of the period was in\r\nthat brush?" she said, pointing to the wainscoting, covered with rustic\r\ncupids after the style of Boucher. "Isn\'t it true that those sheep do\r\nnot walk or sleep or browse like sheep of to-day? And that pretty\r\nlandscape, so false and so orderly, those clumps of many-petalled roses\r\nin the middle of the forest where naught but a bit of eglantine grows in\r\nour days, those tame birds of a species that has apparently disappeared,\r\nand those pink satin gowns which the sun never faded--is there not in\r\nall these a deal of poesy, ideas of luxury and pleasure, of a whole\r\nuseless, harmless, joyous life? Doubtless these absurd fictions were\r\nquite as valuable as our gloomy political deliverances! If only I had\r\nbeen born in those days!" she added with a smile; "frivolous and\r\nnarrow-minded creature that I am, I should have been much better fitted\r\nto paint fans and produce masterpieces of thread-work than to read the\r\nnewspapers and understand the debates in the Chambers!"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Hubert left the young people together; and their conversation\r\ndrifted from one subject to another, until it fell at last upon Madame\r\nDelmare.\r\n\r\n"You were very intimate with our predecessors in this house," said the\r\nyoung woman, "and it is generous on your part to come and see new faces\r\nhere. Madame Delmare," she added, with a penetrating glance at him, "was\r\na remarkable woman, so they say; she must have left memories here which\r\nplace us at a disadvantage, so far as you are concerned."\r\n\r\n"She was an excellent woman," Raymon replied, unconcernedly, "and her\r\nhusband was a worthy man."\r\n\r\n"But," rejoined the reckless girl, "she was something more than an\r\nexcellent woman, I should judge. If I remember rightly there was a charm\r\nabout her personality which calls for a more enthusiastic and more\r\npoetic description. I saw her two years ago, at a ball at the Spanish\r\nambassador\'s. She was fascinating that night; do you remember?"\r\n\r\nRaymon started at this reminder of the evening that he spoke to Indiana\r\nfor the first time. He remembered at the same moment that he had noticed\r\nat that ball the distingu\xc3\xa9 features and clever eyes of the young woman\r\nwith whom he was now talking; but he did not then ask who she was.\r\n\r\nNot until he had taken his leave of her and was congratulating Monsieur\r\nHubert on his daughter\'s charms, did he learn her name.\r\n\r\n"I have not the good fortune to be her father," said the manufacturer;\r\n"but I did the best I could by adopting her. Do you not know my story?"\r\n\r\n"I have been ill for several months," Raymon replied, "and have heard\r\nnothing of you beyond the good you have already done in the province."\r\n\r\n"There are people," said Monsieur Hubert with a smile, "who consider\r\nthat I did a most meritorious thing in adopting Mademoiselle de Nangy;\r\nbut you, monsieur, who have elevated ideas, will judge whether I did\r\nanything more than true delicacy required. Ten years ago, a widower and\r\nchildless, I found myself possessed of funds to a considerable amount,\r\nthe results of my labors, which I was anxious to invest. I found that\r\nthe estate and ch\xc3\xa2teau of Nangy in Bourgogne, national property, were\r\nfor sale and suited me perfectly. I had been in possession some time\r\nwhen I learned that the former lord of the manor and his seven-year-old\r\ngranddaughter were living in a hovel, in extreme destitution. The old\r\nman had received some indemnity, but he had religiously devoted it to\r\nthe payment of debts incurred during the emigration. I tried to better\r\nhis condition and to give him a home in my house; but he had retained in\r\nhis poverty all the pride of his rank. He refused to return to the house\r\nof his ancestors as an object of charity, and died shortly after my\r\narrival, having steadfastly refused to accept any favors at my hands.\r\nThen I took his child there. The little patrician was proud already and\r\naccepted my assistance most unwillingly; but at that age prejudices are\r\nnot deeply rooted and resolutions do not last long. She soon accustomed\r\nherself to look upon me as her father and I brought her up as my own\r\ndaughter. She has rewarded me handsomely by the happiness she has\r\nshowered on my old age. And so, to make sure of my happiness, I have\r\nadopted Mademoiselle de Nangy, and my only hope now is to find her a\r\nhusband worthy of her and able to manage prudently the property I shall\r\nleave her."\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the interest with which Raymon listened to his\r\nconfidences, the excellent man, in true bourgeois fashion, gradually\r\nconfided all his business affairs to him. His attentive auditor found\r\nthat he had a fine, large fortune administered with the most minute\r\ncare, and which simply awaited a younger proprietor, of more fashionable\r\ntastes than the worthy Hubert, to shine forth in all its splendor. He\r\nfelt that he might be the man destined to perform that agreeable task,\r\nand he gave thanks to the ingenious fate which reconciled all his\r\ninterests by offering him, by favor of divers romantic incidents, a\r\nwoman of his own rank possessed of a fine plebeian fortune. It was a\r\nchance not to be let slip, and he put forth all his skill in the effort\r\nto grasp it. Moreover, the heiress was charming; Raymon became more\r\nkindly disposed toward his providence.\r\n\r\nAs for Madame Delmare, he would not think of her. He drove away the\r\nfears which the thought of his letter aroused from time to time; he\r\ntried to persuade himself that poor Indiana would not grasp his meaning\r\nor would not have the courage to respond to it; and he finally succeeded\r\nin deceiving himself and believing that he was not blameworthy, for\r\nRaymon would have been horrified to find that he was selfish. He was not\r\none of those artless villains who come on the stage to make a na\xc3\xafve\r\nconfession of their vices to their own hearts. Vice is not reflected in\r\nits own ugliness, or it would frighten itself; and Shakespeare\'s Iago,\r\nwho is so true to life in his acts, is false in his words, being forced\r\nby our stage conventions to lay bare himself the secret recesses of his\r\ndeep and tortuous heart. Man rarely tramples his conscience under foot\r\nthus coolly. He turns it over, squeezes it, pinches it, disfigures it;\r\nand when he has distorted it and exhausted it and worn it out, he\r\ncarries it about with him as an indulgent and obliging mentor which\r\naccommodates itself to his passions and his interests, but which he\r\npretends always to consult and to fear.\r\n\r\nHe went often to Lagny, therefore, and his visits were agreeable to\r\nMonsieur Hubert; for, as you know, Raymon had the art of winning\r\naffection, and soon the rich bourgeois\'s one desire was to call him his\r\nson-in-law. But he wished that his adopted daughter should choose him\r\nfreely and that they should be allowed every opportunity to know and\r\njudge each other.\r\n\r\nLaure de Nangy was in no haste to assure Raymon\'s happiness; she kept\r\nhim perfectly balanced between fear and hope. Being less generous than\r\nMadame Delmare, but more adroit, distant yet flattering, haughty yet\r\ncajoling, she was the very woman to subjugate Raymon; for she was as\r\nsuperior to him in cunning as he was to Indiana. She soon realized that\r\nher admirer craved her fortune much more than herself. Her placid\r\nimagination anticipated nothing better in the way of homage; she had too\r\nmuch sense, too much knowledge of the world to dream of love when two\r\nmillions were at stake. She had chosen her course calmly and\r\nphilosophically, and she was not inclined to blame Raymon; she did not\r\nhate him because he was of a calculating, unsentimental temper like the\r\nage in which he lived; but she knew him too well to love him. She made\r\nit a matter of pride not to fall below the standard of that cold and\r\nscheming epoch; her self-esteem would have suffered had she been swayed\r\nby the foolish illusions of an ignorant boarding-school miss; she would\r\nhave blushed at being deceived as at being detected in a foolish act; in\r\na word, she made her heroism consist in steering clear of love, as\r\nMadame Delmare\'s consisted in sacrificing everything to it.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Nangy was fully resolved, therefore, to submit to\r\nmarriage as a social necessity; but she took a malicious pleasure in\r\nmaking use of the liberty which still belonged to her, and in imposing\r\nher authority for some time on the man who aspired to deprive her of it.\r\nNo youth, no sweet dreams, no brilliant and deceptive future for that\r\ngirl, who was doomed to undergo all the miseries of wealth. For her,\r\nlife was a matter of stoical calculation, happiness a childish delusion\r\nagainst which she must defend herself as a weakness and an absurdity.\r\n\r\nWhile Raymon was at work building up his fortune, Indiana was drawing\r\nnear the shores of France. But imagine her surprise and alarm, when she\r\nlanded, to see the tri-colored flag floating on the walls of Bordeaux!\r\nThe city was in a state of violent agitation; the prefect had been\r\nalmost murdered the night before; the populace were rising on all sides;\r\nthe garrison seemed to be preparing for a bloody conflict, and the\r\nresult of the revolution was still unknown.\r\n\r\n"I have come too late!" was the thought that fell upon Madame Delmare\r\nlike a stroke of lightning.\r\n\r\nIn her alarm she left on board the little money and the few clothes that\r\nshe possessed, and ran about through the city in a state of frenzy. She\r\ntried to find a diligence for Paris, but the public conveyances were\r\ncrowded with people who were either escaping or going to claim a share\r\nin the spoils of the vanquished. Not until evening did she succeed in\r\nfinding a place. As she was stepping into the coach an improvised patrol\r\nof National Guards objected to the departure of the passengers and\r\ndemanded to see their papers. Indiana had none. While she argued against\r\nthe absurd suspicions of the triumphant party, she heard it stated all\r\nabout her that the monarchy had fallen, that the king was a fugitive,\r\nand that the ministers had been massacred with all their adherents. This\r\nnews, proclaimed with laughter and stamping and shouts of joy, dealt\r\nMadame Delmare a deadly blow. In the whole revolution she was personally\r\ninterested in but one fact; in all France she knew but one man. She fell\r\non the ground in a swoon, and came to herself in a hospital--several\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nAfter two months she was discharged, without money or linen or effects,\r\nweak and trembling, exhausted by an inflammatory brain fever which had\r\ncaused her life to be despaired of several times. When she found herself\r\nin the street, alone, hardly able to walk, without friends, resources or\r\nstrength, when she made an effort to recall the particulars of her\r\nsituation and realized that she was hopelessly lost in that great city,\r\nshe had an indescribable thrill of terror and despair as she thought\r\nthat Raymon\'s fate had long since been decided and that there was not a\r\nsolitary person about her who could put an end to her horrible\r\nuncertainty. The horror of desertion bore down with all its might upon\r\nher crushed spirit, and the apathetic despair born of hopeless misery\r\ngradually deadened all her faculties. In the mental numbness which she\r\nfelt stealing over her, she dragged herself to the harbor, and,\r\nshivering with fever, sat down on a stone to warm herself in the\r\nsunshine, gazing listlessly at the water plashing at her feet. She sat\r\nthere several hours, devoid of energy, of hope, of purpose; but suddenly\r\nshe remembered her clothes and her money, which she had left on the\r\n_Eug\xc3\xa8ne_, and which she might possibly recover; but it was nightfall,\r\nand she dared not go among the sailors who were just leaving their work\r\nwith much rough merriment and question them concerning the ship.\r\nDesiring, on the other hand, to avoid the attention she was beginning to\r\nattract, she left the quay and concealed herself in the ruins of a house\r\nrecently demolished behind the great esplanade of Les Quinconces. There,\r\ncowering in a corner, she passed that cold October night, a night laden\r\nwith bitter thoughts and alarms. At last the day broke; hunger made\r\nitself felt insistent and implacable. She decided to ask alms. Her\r\nclothes, although in wretched condition, still indicated more\r\ncomfortable circumstances than a beggar is supposed to enjoy. People\r\nlooked at her curiously, suspiciously, ironically, and gave her nothing.\r\nAgain she dragged herself to the quays, inquired about the _Eug\xc3\xa8ne_ and\r\nlearned from the first waterman she addressed that she was still in the\r\nroadstead. She hired him to put her aboard and found Random at\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, my fair passenger," he cried, "so you have returned from\r\nParis already! You have come in good time, for I sail to-morrow. Shall I\r\ntake you back to Bourbon?"\r\n\r\nHe informed Madame Delmare that he had caused search to be made for her\r\neverywhere, that he might return what belonged to her. But Indiana had\r\nnot a scrap of paper upon her from which her name could be learned when\r\nshe was taken to the hospital. She had been entered on the books there\r\nand also on the police books under the designation _unknown_; so the\r\ncaptain had been unable to learn anything about her.\r\n\r\nThe next day, despite her weakness and exhaustion, Indiana started for\r\nParis. Her anxiety should have diminished when she saw the turn\r\npolitical affairs had taken; but anxiety does not reason, and love is\r\nfertile in childish fears.\r\n\r\nOn the very evening of her arrival at Paris she hurried to Raymon\'s\r\nhouse and questioned the concierge in an agony of apprehension.\r\n\r\n"Monsieur is quite well," was the reply; "he is at Lagny."\r\n\r\n"At Lagny! you mean at Cercy, do you not?"\r\n\r\n"No, madame, at Lagny, which he owns now."\r\n\r\n"Dear Raymon!" thought Indiana, "he has bought that estate to afford me\r\na refuge where public malice cannot reach me. He knew that I would\r\ncome!"\r\n\r\nDrunk with joy, she hastened, light of heart and instinct with new life,\r\nto take apartments in a furnished house, and devoted the night and part\r\nof the next day to rest. It was so long since the unfortunate creature\r\nhad enjoyed a peaceful sleep! Her dreams were sweet and deceptive, and\r\nwhen she woke she did not regret them, for she found hope at her pillow.\r\nShe dressed with care; she knew that Raymon was particular about all the\r\nminuti\xc3\xa6 of the toilet, and she had ordered the night before a pretty\r\nnew dress which was brought to her just as she rose. But, when she was\r\nready to arrange her hair, she sought in vain the long and magnificent\r\ntresses she had once had; during her illness they had fallen under the\r\nnurse\'s shears. She noticed it then for the first time, her\r\nall-engrossing thoughts had diverted her mind so completely from small\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when she had curled her short black locks about her pale\r\nand melancholy brow, when she had placed upon her shapely head a little\r\nEnglish hat, called then, by way of allusion to the recent blow to great\r\nfortunes, a _three per cent._; when she had fastened at her girdle a\r\nbunch of the flowers whose perfume Raymon loved, she hoped that she\r\nwould still find favor in his sight; for she was as pale and fragile as\r\nin the first days of their acquaintance, and the effect of her illness\r\nhad effaced the traces of the tropical sunshine.\r\n\r\nShe hired a cab in the afternoon and arrived about nine at night at a\r\nvillage on the outskirts of Fontainebleau. There she ordered the driver\r\nto put up his horse and wait for her until the next day, and started off\r\nalone, on foot, by a path which led to Lagny park by a walk of less than\r\nquarter of an hour through the woods. She tried to open the small gate\r\nbut found it locked on the inside. It was her wish to enter by stealth,\r\nto avoid the eyes of the servants and take Raymon by surprise. She\r\nskirted the park wall. It was quite old; she remembered that there were\r\nfrequent breaches, and, by good luck, she found one and passed over\r\nwithout much difficulty.\r\n\r\nWhen she stood upon ground which belonged to Raymon and was to be\r\nthenceforth her refuge, her sanctuary, her fortress and her home, her\r\nheart leaped for joy. With light, triumphant foot she hastened along the\r\nwinding paths she knew so well. She reached the English garden, which\r\nwas dark and deserted on that side. Nothing was changed in the\r\nflower-beds; but the bridge, the painful sight of which she dreaded, had\r\ndisappeared, and the course of the stream had been altered; the spots\r\nwhich might have recalled Noun\'s death had been changed, and no others.\r\n\r\n"He wished to banish that cruel memory," thought Indiana. "He was wrong,\r\nI could have endured it. Was it not for my sake that he planted the\r\nseeds of remorse in his life? Henceforth we are quits, for I too have\r\ncommitted a crime. I may have caused my husband\'s death. Raymon can open\r\nhis arms to me, we will take the place of innocence and virtue to each\r\nother."\r\n\r\nShe crossed the stream on boards laid across where a bridge was to be\r\nbuilt and passed through the flower-garden. She was forced to stop, for\r\nher heart was beating as if it would burst; she looked up at the windows\r\nof her old bedroom. O bliss! a light was shining through the blue\r\ncurtains, Raymon was there. As if he could occupy any other room! The\r\ndoor to the secret stairway was open.\r\n\r\n"He expects me at any time," she thought; "he will be happy but not\r\nsurprised."\r\n\r\nAt the top of the staircase she paused again to take breath; she felt\r\nless strong to endure joy than sorrow. She stooped and looked through\r\nthe keyhole. Raymon was alone, reading. It was really he, it was Raymon\r\noverflowing with life and vigor; his trials had not aged him, the\r\ntempests of politics had not taken a single hair from his head; there he\r\nsat, placid and handsome, his head resting on his white hand which was\r\nburied in his black hair.\r\n\r\nIndiana impulsively tried the door, which opened without resistance.\r\n\r\n"You expected me!" she cried, falling on her knees and resting her\r\nfeeble head upon Raymon\'s bosom; "you counted the months and days, you\r\nknew that the time had passed, but you knew too that I could not fail to\r\ncome at your call. You called me and I am here, I am here! I am dying!"\r\n\r\nHer ideas became tangled in her brain; for some time she knelt there,\r\nsilent, gasping for breath, incapable of speech or thought. Then she\r\nopened her eyes, recognized Raymon as if just waking from a dream,\r\nuttered a cry of frantic joy, and pressed her lips to his, wild, ardent\r\nand happy. He was pale, dumb, motionless, as if struck by lightning.\r\n\r\n"Speak to me, in Heaven\'s name," she cried; "it is I, your Indiana, your\r\nslave whom you recalled from exile and who has travelled three thousand\r\nleagues to love you and serve you; it is your chosen companion, who has\r\nleft everything, risked everything, defied everything, to bring you this\r\nmoment of joy! You are happy, you are content with her, are you not? I\r\nam waiting for my reward; with a word, a kiss I shall be paid a hundred\r\nfold."\r\n\r\nBut Raymon did not reply; his admirable presence of mind had abandoned\r\nhim. He was crushed with surprise, remorse and terror when he saw that\r\nwoman at his feet; he hid his face in his hands and longed for death.\r\n\r\n"My God! my God! you don\'t speak to me, you don\'t kiss me, you have\r\nnothing to say to me!" cried Madame Delmare, pressing Raymon\'s knees to\r\nher breast; "is it because you cannot? Joy makes people ill, it kills\r\nsometimes, I know! Ah! you are not well, you are suffocating, I\r\nsurprised you too suddenly! Try to look at me; see how pale I am, how\r\nold I have grown, how I have suffered! But it was for you, and you will\r\nlove me all the better for it! Say one word to me, Raymon, just one."\r\n\r\n"I would like to weep," said Raymon in a stifled tone.\r\n\r\n"And so would I," said she, covering his hands with kisses. "Ah! yes,\r\nthat would do you good. Weep, weep on my bosom, and I will wipe your\r\ntears away with my kisses. I have come to bring you happiness, to be\r\nwhatever you choose--your companion, your servant or your mistress.\r\nFormerly I was very cruel, very foolish, very selfish. I made you suffer\r\nterribly, and I refused to understand that I demanded what was beyond\r\nyour strength. But since then I have reflected, and as you are not\r\nafraid to defy public opinion with me, I have no right to refuse to make\r\nany sacrifice. Dispose of me, of my blood, of my life, as you will; I am\r\nyours body and soul. I have travelled three thousand leagues to tell you\r\nthis, to give myself to you. Take me, I am your property, you are my\r\nmaster."\r\n\r\nI cannot say what infernal project passed rapidly through Raymon\'s\r\nbrain. He removed his clenched hands from his face and looked at Indiana\r\nwith diabolical _sang-froid_; then a wicked smile played about his lips\r\nand made his eyes gleam, for Indiana was still lovely.\r\n\r\n"First of all, we must conceal you," he said, rising.\r\n\r\n"Why conceal me here?" she said; "aren\'t you at liberty to take me in\r\nand protect me, who have no one but you on earth, and who, without you,\r\nshall be compelled to beg on the public highway? Why, even society can\r\nno longer call it a crime for you to love me; I have taken everything on\r\nmy own shoulders! But where are you going?" she cried, as she saw him\r\nwalking toward the door.\r\n\r\nShe clung to him with the terror of a child who does not wish to be left\r\nalone a single instant, and dragged herself along on her knees behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis purpose was to lock the door; but he was too late. The door opened\r\nbefore he could reach it, and Laure de Nangy entered. She seemed less\r\nsurprised than exasperated, and did not utter an exclamation, but\r\nstooped a little to look with snapping eyes at the half-fainting woman\r\non the floor; then, with a cold, bitter, scornful smile, she said:\r\n\r\n"Madame Delmare, you seem to enjoy placing three persons in a very\r\nstrange situation; but I thank you for assigning me the least ridiculous\r\nr\xc3\xb4le of the three, and this is how I discharge it. Be good enough to\r\nretire."\r\n\r\nIndignation renewed Indiana\'s strength; she rose and drew herself up to\r\nher full height.\r\n\r\n"Who is this woman, pray?" she said to Raymon, "and by what right does\r\nshe give me orders in your house?"\r\n\r\n"You are in my house, madame," retorted Laure.\r\n\r\n"Speak, in heaven\'s name, monsieur," cried Indiana fiercely, shaking the\r\nwretched man\'s arm; "tell me whether she is your mistress or your wife!"\r\n\r\n"She is my wife," Raymon replied with a dazed air.\r\n\r\n"I forgive your uncertainty," said Madame de Rami\xc3\xa8re with a cruel\r\nsmile. "If you had remained where your duty required you to remain, you\r\nwould have received cards to monsieur\'s marriage. Come, Raymon," she\r\nadded in a tone of sarcastic amiability, "I am moved to pity by your\r\nembarrassment. You are rather young; you will realize now, I trust, that\r\nmore prudence is advisable. I leave it for you to put an end to this\r\nabsurd scene. I would laugh at it if you didn\'t look so utterly\r\nwretched."\r\n\r\nWith that she withdrew, well satisfied with the dignity she had\r\ndisplayed, and secretly triumphant because the incident had placed her\r\nhusband in a position of inferiority and dependence with regard to her.\r\n\r\nWhen Indiana recovered the use of her faculties she was alone in a close\r\ncarriage, being driven rapidly toward Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped at the barrier. A servant whom Madame Delmare\r\nrecognized as a man who had formerly been in Raymon\'s service came to\r\nthe door and asked where he should leave _madame_. Indiana instinctively\r\ngave the name and street number of the lodging-house at which she had\r\nslept the night before. On arriving there, she fell into a chair and\r\nremained there until morning, without a thought of going to bed, without\r\nmoving, longing for death but too crushed, too inert to summon strength\r\nto kill herself. She believed that it was impossible to live after such\r\nterrible blows, and that death would of its own motion come in search of\r\nher. She remained there all the following day, taking no sustenance,\r\nmaking no reply to the offers of service that were made her.\r\n\r\nI do not know that there is anything more horrible on earth than life in\r\na furnished lodging-house in Paris, especially when it is situated, as\r\nthis one was, in a dark, narrow street, and only a dull, hazy light\r\ncrawls regretfully, as it were, over the smoky ceilings and soiled\r\nwindows. And then there is something chilly and repellent in the sight\r\nof the furniture to which you are unaccustomed and to which your idle\r\nglance turns in vain for a memory, a touch of sympathy. All those\r\nobjects which belong, so to speak, to no one, because they belong to all\r\ncomers; that room where no one has left any trace of his passage save\r\nnow and then a strange name, found on a card in the mirror-frame; that\r\nmercenary roof, which has sheltered so many poor travellers, so many\r\nlonely strangers, with hospitality for none; which looks with\r\nindifference upon so many human agitations and can describe none of\r\nthem: the discordant, never-ending noise from the street, which does not\r\neven allow you to sleep and thus escape grief or ennui: all these are\r\ncauses of disgust and irritation even to one who does not bring to the\r\nhorrible place such a frame of mind as Madame Delmare\'s. You ill-starred\r\nprovincial, who have left your fields, your blue sky, your verdure, your\r\nhouse and your family, to come and shut yourself up in this dungeon of\r\nthe mind and the heart--see Paris, lovely Paris, which in your dreams\r\nhas seemed to you such a marvel of beauty! see it stretch away yonder,\r\nblack with mud and rainy, as noisy and pestilent and rapid as a torrent\r\nof slime! There is the perpetual revel, always brilliant and perfumed,\r\nwhich was promised you; there are the intoxicating pleasures, the\r\nwonderful surprises, the treasures of sight and taste and hearing which\r\nwere to contend for the possession of your passions and faculties, which\r\nare of limited capacity and powerless to enjoy them all at once! See,\r\nyonder, the affable, winning, hospitable Parisian, as he was described\r\nto you, always in a hurry, always careworn! Tired out before you have\r\nseen the whole of this ever-moving population, this inextricable\r\nlabyrinth, you take refuge, overwhelmed with dismay, in the cheerful\r\nprecincts of a furnished lodging-house, where, after hastily installing\r\nyou, the only servant of a house that is often of immense size leaves\r\nyou to die in peace, if fatigue or sorrow deprive you of the strength to\r\nattend to the thousand necessities of life.\r\n\r\nBut to be a woman and to find oneself in such a place, spurned by\r\neverybody, three thousand leagues from all human affection; to be\r\nwithout money, which is much worse than being abandoned in a vast desert\r\nwithout water; to have in all one\'s past not a single happy memory that\r\nis not poisoned or withered, in the whole future not a single hope to\r\ndivert one\'s thoughts from the emptiness of the present, is the last\r\ndegree of misery and hopelessness. And so Madame Delmare, making no\r\nattempt to contend against a destiny that was fulfilled, against a\r\nbroken, ruined life, submitted to the gnawings of hunger, fever and\r\nsorrow without uttering a complaint, without shedding a tear, without\r\nmaking an effort to die an hour earlier, to suffer an hour less.\r\n\r\nThey found her on the morning of the second day, lying on the floor,\r\nstiff with cold, with clenched teeth, blue lips and lustreless eyes; but\r\nshe was not dead. The landlady examined her secretary and, seeing how\r\npoorly supplied it was, considered whether the hospital was not the\r\nproper place for this stranger, who certainly had not the means to pay\r\nthe expenses of a long and costly illness. However, as she was a woman\r\n_overflowing with humanity_, she caused her to be put to bed and sent\r\nfor a doctor to ascertain if the illness would last more than a day or\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nA doctor appeared who had not been sent for. Indiana, on opening her\r\neyes, found him beside her bed. I need not tell you his name.\r\n\r\n"Oh! you here! you here!" she cried, throwing herself, almost fainting,\r\non his breast. "You are my good angel! But you come too late, and I can\r\ndo nothing for you except to die blessing you."\r\n\r\n"You will not die, my dear," replied Ralph with deep emotion; "life may\r\nstill smile upon you. The laws which interfered with your happiness no\r\nlonger fetter your affection. I would have preferred to destroy the\r\ninvincible spell which a man whom I neither like nor esteem has cast\r\nupon you; but that is not in my power, and I am tired of seeing you\r\nsuffer. Hitherto your life has been perfectly frightful; it cannot be\r\nmore so. Besides, even if my gloomy forebodings are realized and the\r\nhappiness of which you have dreamed is destined to be of short duration,\r\nyou will at least have enjoyed it for some little time, you will not die\r\nwithout a taste of it. So I sacrifice all my repugnance and dislike. The\r\ndestiny which casts you, all alone as you are, into my arms, imposes\r\nupon me the duties of a father and a guardian toward you. I come to tell\r\nyou that you are free and that you may unite your lot to Monsieur de\r\nRami\xc3\xa8re\'s. Delmare is no more."\r\n\r\nTears rolled slowly down Ralph\'s cheeks while he was speaking. Indiana\r\nsuddenly sat up in bed and cried, wringing her hands in despair:\r\n\r\n"My husband is dead! and it was I who killed him! And you talk to me of\r\nthe future and happiness, as if such a thing were possible for the heart\r\nthat detests and despises itself! But be sure that God is just and that\r\nI am cursed. Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re is married."\r\n\r\nShe fell back, utterly exhausted, into her cousin\'s arms. They were\r\nunable to resume conversation until several hours later.\r\n\r\n"Your justly disturbed conscience may be set at rest," said Ralph, in a\r\nsolemn, but sad and gentle tone. "Delmare was at death\'s door when you\r\ndeserted him: he did not wake from the sleep in which you left him, he\r\nnever knew of your flight, he died without cursing you or weeping for\r\nyou. Toward morning, when I woke from the heavy sleep into which I had\r\nfallen beside his bed, I found his face purple and he was burning hot\r\nand breathing stertorously in his sleep; he was already stricken with\r\napoplexy. I ran to your room and was surprised not to find you there;\r\nbut I had no time to try to discover the explanation of your absence; I\r\nwas not seriously alarmed about it until after Delmare\'s death.\r\nEverything that skill could do was of no avail, the disease progressed\r\nwith startling rapidity, and he died an hour later, in my arms, without\r\nrecovering the use of his senses. At the last moment, however, his\r\nbenumbed, clouded mind seemed to make an effort to come to life; he felt\r\nfor my hand which he took for yours--his were already stiff and numb--he\r\ntried to press it, and died, stammering your name."\r\n\r\n"I heard his last words," said Indiana gloomily; "at the moment that I\r\nleft him forever, he spoke to me in his sleep. \'That man will ruin you,\'\r\nhe said. Those words are here," she added, putting one hand to her heart\r\nand the other to her head.\r\n\r\n"When I succeeded in taking my eyes and my thoughts from that dead\r\nbody," continued Ralph, "I thought of you; of you, Indiana, who were\r\nfree thenceforth, and who could not weep for your master unless from\r\nkindness of heart or religious feeling. I was the only one whom his\r\ndeath deprived of something, for I was his friend, and, even if he was\r\nnot always very sociable, at all events I had no rival in his heart. I\r\nfeared the effect of breaking the news to you too suddenly, and I went\r\nto the door to wait for you, thinking that you would soon return from\r\nyour morning walk. I waited a long while. I will not attempt to describe\r\nmy anxiety, my search, and my alarm when I found Ophelia\'s body, all\r\nbleeding and bruised by the rocks; the waves had washed it upon the\r\nbeach. I looked a long while, alas! expecting to discover yours; for I\r\nthought that you had taken your own life, and for three days I believed\r\nthat there was nothing left on earth for me to love. It is useless to\r\nspeak of my grief; you must have foreseen it when you abandoned me.\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile, a rumor that you had fled spread swiftly through the colony.\r\nA vessel came into port that had passed the _Eug\xc3\xa8ne_ in Mozambique\r\nChannel; some of the ship\'s company had been aboard your ship. A\r\npassenger had recognized you, and in less than three days the whole\r\nisland knew of your departure.\r\n\r\n"I spare you the absurd and insulting reports that resulted from the\r\ncoincidence of those two events on the same night, your flight and your\r\nhusband\'s death. I was not spared in the charitable conclusions that\r\npeople amused themselves by drawing; but I paid no attention to them. I\r\nhad still one duty to perform on earth, to make sure of your welfare and\r\nto lend you a helping hand if necessary. I sailed soon after you; but I\r\nhad a horrible voyage and have been in France only a week. My first\r\nthought was to go to Monsieur de Rami\xc3\xa8re to inquire about you; but by\r\ngood luck I met his servant Carle, who had just brought you here. I\r\nasked him no questions except where you were living, and I came here\r\nwith the conviction that I should not find you alone."\r\n\r\n"Alone, alone! shamefully abandoned!" cried Madame Delmare. "But let us\r\nnot speak of that man, let us never speak of him. I can never love him\r\nagain, for I despise him; but you must not tell me that I once loved\r\nhim, for that reminds me of my shame and my crime; it casts a terrible\r\nreproach upon my last moments. Ah! be my angel of consolation; you who\r\nnever fail to come and offer me a friendly hand in all the crises of my\r\nmiserable life. Fulfil with pity your last mission; say to me words of\r\naffection and forgiveness, so that I may die at peace, and hope for\r\npardon from the Judge who awaits me on high."\r\n\r\nShe hoped to die; but grief rivets the chain of life instead of breaking\r\nit. She was not even dangerously ill; she simply had no strength, and\r\nlapsed into a state of languor and apathy which resembled imbecility.\r\n\r\nRalph tried to distract her; he took her away from everything that could\r\nremind her of Raymon. He took her to Touraine, he surrounded her with\r\nall the comforts of life; he devoted all his time to making a portion of\r\nhers endurable; and when he failed, when he had exhausted all the\r\nresources of his art and his affection without bringing a feeble gleam\r\nof pleasure to that gloomy, careworn face, he deplored the powerlessness\r\nof his words and blamed himself bitterly for the ineptitude of his\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nOne day he found her more crushed and hopeless than ever. He dared not\r\nspeak to her, but sat down beside her with a melancholy air. Thereupon,\r\nIndiana turned to him and said, pressing his hand tenderly:\r\n\r\n"I cause you a vast deal of pain, poor Ralph! and you must be patient\r\nbeyond words to endure the spectacle of such egotistical, cowardly\r\nmisery as mine! Your unpleasant task was finished long ago. The most\r\ninsanely exacting woman could not ask of friendship more than you have\r\ndone for me. Now leave me to the misery that is gnawing at my heart; do\r\nnot spoil your pure and holy life by contact with an accursed life; try\r\nto find elsewhere the happiness which cannot exist near me."\r\n\r\n"I do in fact give up all hope of curing you, Indiana," he replied; "but\r\nI will never abandon you even if you should tell me that I annoy you;\r\nfor you still require bodily care, and if you are not willing that I\r\nshould be your friend, I will at all events be your servant. But listen\r\nto me; I have an expedient to propose to you which I have kept in\r\nreserve for the last stage of the disease, but which certainly is\r\ninfallible."\r\n\r\n"I know but one remedy for sorrow," she replied, "and that is\r\nforgetting; for I have had time to convince myself that argument is\r\nunavailing. Let us hope everything from time, therefore. If my will\r\ncould obey the gratitude which you inspire in me, I should be now as\r\ncheerful and calm as in the days of our childhood; believe me, my\r\nfriend, I take no pleasure in nourishing my trouble and inflaming my\r\nwound; do I not know that all my sufferings rebound on your heart? Alas!\r\nI would like to forget, to be cured! but I am only a weak woman. Ralph,\r\nbe patient and do not think me ungrateful."\r\n\r\nShe burst into tears. Sir Ralph took her hand.\r\n\r\n"Listen, dear Indiana," he said; "to forget is not in our power; I do\r\nnot accuse you! I can suffer patiently; but to see you suffer is beyond\r\nmy strength. Indeed, why should we struggle thus, weak creatures that we\r\nare, against a destiny of iron? It is quite enough to drag this\r\ncannon-ball; the God whom you and I adore did not condemn man to undergo\r\nso much misery without giving him the instinct to escape from it; and\r\nwhat constitutes, in my opinion, man\'s most marked superiority over the\r\nbrute is his ability to understand what the remedy is for all his ills.\r\nThe remedy is suicide; that is what I propose, what I advise."\r\n\r\n"I have often thought of it," Indiana replied after a short silence.\r\n"Long ago I was violently tempted to resort to it, but religious\r\nscruples arrested me. Since then my ideas have reached a higher level,\r\nin solitude. Misfortune clung to me and gradually taught me a different\r\nreligion from that taught by men. When you came to my assistance I had\r\ndetermined to allow myself to die of hunger; but you begged me to live,\r\nand I had not the right to refuse you that sacrifice. Now, what holds me\r\nback is your existence, your future. What will you do all alone, poor\r\nRalph, without family, without passions, without affections? Since I\r\nhave received these horrible wounds in my heart I am no longer good for\r\nanything to you; but perhaps I shall recover. Yes, Ralph, I will do my\r\nutmost, I swear. Have patience a little longer; soon, perhaps, I shall\r\nbe able to smile. I long to become tranquil and light-hearted once more\r\nin order to devote to you this life for which you have fought so stoutly\r\nwith misfortune."\r\n\r\n"No, my dear, no; I do not desire such a sacrifice; I will never accept\r\nit," said Ralph. "Wherein is my life more precious than yours, pray? Why\r\nmust you inflict a hateful future upon yourself in order that mine may\r\nbe pleasant? Do you think that it will be possible for me to enjoy it\r\nwhile feeling that your heart has no share in it? No, I am not so\r\nselfish as that. Let us not attempt, I beg you, an impossible heroism;\r\nit is overweening pride and presumption to hope to renounce all\r\nself-love thus. Let us view our situation calmly and dispose of our\r\nremaining days as common property which neither of us has the right to\r\nappropriate at the other\'s expense. For a long time, ever since my\r\nbirth, I may say, life has been a bore and a burden to me; now I no\r\nlonger feel the courage to endure it without bitterness of heart and\r\nimpiety. Let us go together; let us return to God, who exiled us in this\r\nworld of trials, in this vale of tears, but who will surely not refuse\r\nto open His arms to us when, bruised and weary, we go to Him and implore\r\nHis indulgence and His mercy. I believe in God, Indiana, and it was I\r\nwho first taught you to believe in Him. So have confidence in me; an\r\nupright heart cannot deceive one who questions it with sincerity. I feel\r\nthat we have both suffered enough here on earth to be cleansed of our\r\nsins. The baptism of unhappiness has surely purified our souls\r\nsufficiently; let us give them back to Him who gave them."\r\n\r\nThis idea engrossed Ralph and Indiana for several days, at the end of\r\nwhich it was decided that they should commit suicide together. It only\r\nremained to choose what sort of death they would die.\r\n\r\n"It is a matter of some importance," said Ralph; "but I have already\r\nconsidered it, and this is what I have to suggest. The act that we are\r\nabout to undertake not being the result of a momentary mental\r\naberration, but of a deliberate determination formed after calm and\r\npious reflection, it is important that we should bring to it the\r\nmeditative seriousness of a Catholic receiving the sacraments of his\r\nChurch. For us the universe is the temple in which we adore God. In the\r\nbosom of majestic, virgin nature we are impressed by the consciousness\r\nof His power, pure of all human profanation. Let us go back to the\r\ndesert, therefore, so that we may be able to pray. Here, in this country\r\nswarming with men and vices, in the bosom of this civilization which\r\ndenies God or disfigures Him, I feel that I should be ill at ease,\r\ndistraught and depressed. I would like to die cheerfully, with a serene\r\nbrow and with my eyes gazing heavenward. But where can we find heaven\r\nhere? I will tell you, therefore, the spot where suicide appeared to me\r\nin its noblest and most solemn aspect. It is in Ile Bourbon, on the\r\nverge of a precipice, on the summit of the cliff from which the\r\ntransparent cascade, surmounted by a gorgeous rainbow, plunges into the\r\nlonely ravine of Bernica. That is where we passed the sweetest hours of\r\nour childhood; that is where I bewailed the bitterest sorrows of my\r\nlife; that is where I learned to pray, to hope; that is where I would\r\nlike, during one of the lovely nights of that latitude, to bury myself\r\nin those pure waters and go down into the cool, flower-decked grave\r\nformed by the depths of the verdure-lined abyss. If you have no\r\npredilection for any other spot, give me the satisfaction of offering up\r\nour twofold sacrifice on the spot which witnessed the games of our\r\nchildhood and the sorrows of our youth."\r\n\r\n"I agree," said Madame Delmare, placing her hand in Ralph\'s to seal the\r\ncompact. "I have always been drawn to the banks of the stream by an\r\ninvincible attraction, by the memory of my poor Noun. To die as she died\r\nwill be sweet to me; it will be an atonement for her death, which I\r\ncaused."\r\n\r\n"Moreover," said Ralph, "another sea voyage, made under the influence of\r\nother feelings than those which have agitated us hitherto, is the best\r\npreparation we could imagine for communing with ourselves, for detaching\r\nourselves from earthly affections, for raising ourselves in unalloyed\r\npurity to the feet of the Supreme Being. Isolated from the whole world,\r\nalways ready to leave this life with glad hearts, we shall watch with\r\nenchanted eyes the tempest arouse the elements and unfold its\r\nmagnificent spectacles before us. Come, Indiana, let us go; let us shake\r\nthe dust of this ungrateful land from our feet. To die here, under\r\nRaymon\'s eyes, would be to all appearance a mere commonplace, cowardly\r\nrevenge. Let us leave that man\'s punishment to God; and let us go and\r\nbeseech Him to open the treasures of His mercy to that barren and\r\nungrateful heart."\r\n\r\nThey left France. The schooner _Nahandove_, as fleet and nimble as a\r\nbird, bore them to their twice-abandoned country. Never was there so\r\npleasant and fast a passage. It seemed as if a favorable wind had\r\nundertaken to guide safely into port those two ill-fated beings who had\r\nbeen tossed about so long among the reefs and shoals of life. During\r\nthose three months Indiana reaped the fruit of her docile compliance\r\nwith Ralph\'s advice. The sea air, so bracing and so penetrating,\r\nrestored her impaired health; a wave of peace overflowed her wearied\r\nheart. The certainty that she would soon have done with her sufferings\r\nproduced upon her the effect of a doctor\'s assurances upon a credulous\r\npatient. Forgetting her past life, she opened her heart to the profound\r\nemotions of religious hope. Her thoughts were all impregnated with a\r\nmysterious charm, a celestial perfume. Never had the sea and sky seemed\r\nto her so beautiful. It seemed to her that she saw them for the first\r\ntime, she discovered so many new splendors and glories in them. Her brow\r\nbecame serene once more, and one would have said that a ray of the\r\nDivine essence had passed into her sweetly melancholy eyes.\r\n\r\nA change no less extraordinary took place in Ralph\'s soul and in his\r\noutward aspect; the same causes produced almost the same results. His\r\nheart, so long hardened against sorrow, softened in the revivifying\r\nwarmth of hope. Heaven descended also into that bitter, wounded heart.\r\nHis words took on the stamp of his feelings and for the first time\r\nIndiana became acquainted with his real character. The reverent, filial\r\nintimacy that bound them together took from the one his painful shyness,\r\nfrom the other her unjust prejudices. Every day cured Ralph of some\r\n_gaucherie_ of his nature, Indiana of some error of her judgment. At the\r\nsame time the painful memory of Raymon faded away and gradually vanished\r\nin face of Ralph\'s unsuspected virtues, his sublime sincerity. As the\r\none grew greater in her estimation, the other fell away. At last, by\r\ndint of comparing the two men, every vestige of her blind and fatal love\r\nwas effaced from her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was last year, one evening during the never-ending summer that reigns\r\nin those latitudes, that two passengers from the schooner _Nahandove_\r\njourneyed into the mountains of Ile Bourbon three days after landing.\r\nThese two persons had devoted the interval to repose, a precaution quite\r\ninconsistent with the plan which had brought them to the colony. But\r\nsuch was evidently not their opinion; for, after taking _faham_ together\r\non the veranda, they dressed with especial care as if they intended to\r\npass the evening in society, and, taking the road to the mountain, they\r\nreached the ravine of Bernica after about an hour\'s walk.\r\n\r\nChance willed that it should be one of the loveliest evenings for which\r\nthe moon ever furnished light in the tropics. That luminary had just\r\nrisen from the dark waves and was beginning to cast a long band of\r\nquick-silver on the sea; but its rays did not shine into the gorge, and\r\nthe edges of the basin reflected only the trembling gleam of a few\r\nstars. Even the lemon-trees on the higher slopes of the mountain were\r\nnot covered with the pale diamonds with which the moon sprinkles their\r\npolished, brittle leaves. The ebony trees and the tamarinds murmured\r\nsoftly in the darkness; only the bushy tufts at the summit of the huge\r\npalm-trees, whose slender trunks rose a hundred feet from the ground,\r\nshone with a greenish tinge in the silvery beams.\r\n\r\nThe sea-birds were resting quietly in the crevices of the cliffs, and\r\nonly a few blue pigeons, concealed behind the projections of the\r\nmountain, raised their melancholy, passionate note in the distance.\r\nLovely beetles, living jewels, rustled gently in the branches of the\r\ncoffee-trees, or skimmed the surface of the lake with a buzzing noise,\r\nand the regular plashing of the cascade seemed to exchange mysterious\r\nwords with the echoes on its shores.\r\n\r\nThe two solitary promenaders ascended by a steep and winding path to the\r\ntop of the gorge, to the spot where the torrent plunges down in a white\r\ncolumn of vapor to the foot of the precipice. They found themselves on a\r\nsmall platform admirably adapted to their purpose. A number of\r\nconvolvuli hanging from the trunks of trees formed a natural cradle\r\nsuspended over the waterfall. Sir Ralph, with wonderful self-possession,\r\ncut away several branches which might impede their spring, then took his\r\ncompanion\'s hand and drew her to a seat beside him on a moss-covered\r\nrock from which in the daytime the beautiful view from that spot could\r\nbe seen in all its wild and charming grandeur. But at that moment the\r\ndarkness and the dense vapor from the cascade enveloped everything and\r\nmade the height of the precipice seem immeasurable and awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\n"Let me remind you, my dear Indiana," said Ralph, "that the success of\r\nour undertaking requires the greatest self-possession on our part. If\r\nyou jump hastily in a direction where, because of the darkness, you see\r\nno obstacles, you will inevitably bruise yourself on the rocks and your\r\ndeath will be slow and painful; but, if you take care to throw yourself\r\nin the direction of the white line which marks the course of the\r\nwaterfall you will fall into the lake with it, and the water itself will\r\nsee to it that you do not miss your aim. But, if you prefer to wait an\r\nhour, the moon will rise high enough to give us light."\r\n\r\n"I am willing," Indiana replied, "especially as we ought to devote these\r\nlast moments to religious thoughts."\r\n\r\n"You are right, my dear," said Ralph. "This last hour should be one of\r\nmeditation and prayer. I do not say that we ought to make our peace with\r\nthe Eternal, that would be to forget the distance that separates us from\r\nHis sublime power; but we ought, I think, to make our peace with the men\r\nwho have caused our suffering, and to confide to the wind which blows\r\ntoward the northeast words of pity for those from whom three thousand\r\nleagues of ocean separate us."\r\n\r\nIndiana received this suggestion without surprise or emotion. For\r\nseveral months past her thoughts had become more and more elevated in\r\ndirect proportion to the change that had taken place in Ralph. She no\r\nlonger listened to him simply as a phlegmatic adviser; she followed him\r\nin silence as a good spirit whose mission it was to take her from the\r\nearth and deliver her from her torments.\r\n\r\n"I agree," she said; "I am overjoyed to feel that I can forgive without\r\nan effort, that I have neither hatred nor regret nor love nor resentment\r\nin my heart; indeed, at this moment, I hardly remember the sorrows of my\r\nsad life and the ingratitude of those who surrounded me. Almighty God!\r\nThou seest the deepest recesses of my heart; Thou knowest that it is\r\npure and calm, and that all my thoughts of love and hope have turned to\r\nThee."\r\n\r\nThereupon, Ralph seated himself at Indiana\'s feet and began to pray in a\r\nloud voice that rose above the roar of the cascade. It was the first\r\ntime perhaps since he was born that his whole thought came to his lips.\r\nThe hour of his death had struck; his heart was no longer held in check\r\nby fetters or mysteries; it belonged to God alone; the chains of society\r\nno longer weighed it down. Its ardor was no longer a crime, it was free\r\nto soar upward to God who awaited it; the veil that concealed so much\r\nvirtue, grandeur and power fell away, and the man\'s mind rose at its\r\nfirst leap to the level of his heart.\r\n\r\nAs a bright flame burns amid dense clouds of smoke and scatters them, so\r\ndid the sacred fire that glowed in the depths of his being send forth\r\nits brilliant light. The first time that that inflexible conscience\r\nfound itself delivered from its trammels and its fears, words came of\r\nthemselves to the assistance of his thoughts, and the man of mediocre\r\ntalents, who had never said any but commonplace things in his life,\r\nbecame, in his last hour, eloquent and convincing as Raymon had never\r\nbeen. Do not expect me to repeat to you the strange harangue that he\r\nconfided to the echoes of the vast solitude; not even he himself, if he\r\nwere here, could repeat it. There are moments of mental exaltation and\r\necstasy when our thoughts are purified, subtilized, etherealized as it\r\nwere. These infrequent moments raise us so high, carry us so far out of\r\nourselves, that when we fall back upon the earth we lose all\r\nconsciousness and memory of that intellectual debauch. Who can\r\nunderstand the anchorite\'s mysterious visions? Who can tell the dreams\r\nof the poet before his exaltation cooled so that he could write them\r\ndown for us? Who can say what marvellous things are revealed to the soul\r\nof the just man when Heaven opens to receive him? Ralph, a man so\r\nutterly commonplace to all outward appearance--and yet an exceptional\r\nman, for he firmly believed in God and consulted the book of his\r\nconscience day by day--Ralph at that moment was adjusting his accounts\r\nwith eternity. It was the time to be himself, to lay bare his whole\r\nmoral being, to lay aside, before the Judge, the disguise that men had\r\nforced upon him. Casting away the haircloth in which sorrow had\r\nenveloped his bones, he stood forth sublime and radiant as if he had\r\nalready entered into the abode of divine rewards.\r\n\r\nAs she listened to him, it did not occur to Indiana to be surprised; she\r\ndid not ask herself if it were really Ralph who talked like that. The\r\nRalph she had known had ceased to exist, and he to whom she was\r\nlistening now seemed to be a friend whom she had formerly seen in her\r\ndreams and who finally became incarnate for her on the brink of the\r\ngrave. She felt her own pure soul soar upward in the same flight. A\r\nprofound religious sympathy aroused in her the same emotions, and tears\r\nof enthusiasm fell from her eyes upon Ralph\'s hair.\r\n\r\nThereupon, the moon rose over the tops of the great palms, and its\r\nbeams, shining between the branches of the convolvuli, enveloped Indiana\r\nin a pale, misty light which made her resemble, in her white dress and\r\nwith her long hair falling over her shoulders, the wraith of some maiden\r\nlost in the desert.\r\n\r\nSir Ralph knelt before her and said:\r\n\r\n"Now, Indiana, you must forgive me for all the injury I have done you,\r\nso that I may forgive myself for it."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" she replied, "what can I possibly have to forgive you, my poor\r\nRalph? Ought I not, on the contrary, to bless you to the last moment of\r\nmy life, as you have forced me to do in all the days of misery that have\r\nfallen to my lot?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know how far I have been blameworthy," rejoined Ralph; "but it\r\nis impossible that, in the course of such a long and terrible battle\r\nwith my destiny, I should not have been many times without my own\r\nvolition."\r\n\r\n"Of what battle are you speaking?" queried Indiana.\r\n\r\n"That is what I must explain to you before we die; that is the secret of\r\nmy life. You asked me to tell it to you on the ship that brought us\r\nhere, and I promised to do so on the shore of Bernica Lake, when the\r\nmoon should rise upon us for the last time."\r\n\r\n"That moment has come," she said, "and I am listening."\r\n\r\n"Summon all your patience then, for I have a long story to tell you,\r\nIndiana, and that story is my own."\r\n\r\n"I thought that I knew it, inasmuch as I have hardly ever been separated\r\nfrom you."\r\n\r\n"You do not know it; you do not know it for a single day, a single\r\nhour," said Ralph sadly. "When could I have told it to you, pray? It is\r\nHeaven\'s will that the only suitable moment for me to do so, should be\r\nthe last moment of your life and my own. But it is as innocent and\r\nproper to-day as it would formerly have been insane and criminal. It is\r\na personal gratification for which no one has the right to blame me at\r\nthis hour, which you accord to me in order to complete the task of\r\npatience and gentleness which you have taken upon yourself with regard\r\nto me. Endure to the end, therefore, the burden of my unhappiness; and\r\nif my words tire you and annoy you, listen to the waterfall as it sings\r\nthe hymn of the dead over me.\r\n\r\n"I was born to love; none of you chose to believe it, and your error in\r\nthat regard had a decisive influence on my character. It is true that\r\nnature, while giving me an ardent heart, was guilty of a strange\r\ninconsistency; she placed on my face a stone mask and on my tongue a\r\nweight that it could not raise; she refused me what she grants to the\r\nmost ordinary mortals, the power to express my feelings by the glance or\r\nby speech. That made me selfish. People judged the mental being by the\r\nouter envelope and, like an imperfect fruit I was compelled to dry up\r\nunder the rough husk which I could not cast off. I was hardly born when\r\nI was cast out of the heart which I most needed. My mother put me away\r\nfrom her breast with disgust, because my baby face could not return her\r\nsmile. At an age when one can hardly distinguish a thought from a\r\ndesire, I was already branded with the hateful designation of egotist.\r\n\r\n"Thereupon it was decided that no one would love me, because I was\r\nunable to put in words my affection for anyone. They made me unhappy,\r\nthey declared that I did not feel my unhappiness; I was almost banished\r\nfrom my father\'s house; they sent me to live among the rocks like a\r\nlonely shore-bird. You know what my childhood was, Indiana. I passed the\r\nlong days in the desert, with no anxious mother to come there in search\r\nof me, with no friendly voice amid the silence of the ravines to remind\r\nme that the approach of night called me back to the cradle. I grew up\r\nalone, I lived alone; but God would not permit me to be unhappy to the\r\nend, for I shall not die alone.\r\n\r\n"Heaven however sent me a gift, a consolation, a hope. You came into my\r\nlife as if Heaven had created you for me. Poor child! abandoned like me,\r\nlike me set adrift in life without love and without protectors, you\r\nseemed to be destined for me--at least I flattered myself that it was\r\nso. Was I too presumptuous? For ten years you were mine, absolutely\r\nmine; I had no rivals, no misgivings. At that time I had had no\r\nexperience of what jealousy is.\r\n\r\n"That time, Indiana, was the least dismal period of my life. I made of\r\nyou my sister, my daughter, my companion, my pupil, my whole society.\r\nYour need of me made my life something more than that of a wild beast;\r\nfor your sake I threw off the gloom into which the contempt of my own\r\nfamily had cast me. I began to esteem myself by becoming useful to you.\r\nI must tell you everything, Indiana; after accepting the burden of life\r\nfor you, my imagination suggested the hope of a reward. I accustomed\r\nmyself--forgive the words I am about to use; even to-day I cannot utter\r\nthem without fear and trembling--I accustomed myself to think that you\r\nwould be my wife; child that you were, I looked upon you as my\r\nbetrothed; my imagination arrayed you in the charms of young womanhood;\r\nI was impatient to see you in your maturity. My brother, who had usurped\r\nmy share of the family affection and who took pleasure in peaceful\r\navocations, had a garden on the hillside which we can see from here by\r\ndaylight, and which subsequent owners have transformed into a\r\nrice-field. The care of his flowers occupied his pleasantest moments,\r\nand every morning he went out to watch their progress with an impatient\r\neye, and to wonder, child that he was, because they had not grown so\r\nmuch as he expected in a single night. You, Indiana, were my whole\r\nvocation, my only joy, my only treasure; you were the young plant that I\r\ncultivated, the bud that I was impatient to see bloom. I, too, looked\r\neagerly every morning for the effect of another day that had passed over\r\nyour head; for I was already a young man and you were but a child.\r\nAlready passions of which you did not know the name were stirring my\r\nbosom; my fifteen years played havoc with my imagination, and you were\r\nsurprised to see me so often in a melancholy mood, sharing your games,\r\nbut taking no pleasure in them. You could not imagine that a fruit or a\r\nbird was no longer a priceless treasure to me as it was to you, and I\r\nalready seemed cold and odd to you. And yet you loved me such as I was;\r\nfor, despite my melancholy, there was not a moment of my life that was\r\nnot devoted to you; my sufferings made you dearer to my heart; I\r\ncherished the insane hope that it would be your mission to change them\r\nto joys some day.\r\n\r\n"Alas! forgive me for the sacrilegious thought which kept me alive for\r\nten years; if it were a crime in the accursed child to hope for you,\r\nlovely, simple-hearted child of the mountains, God alone is guilty of\r\ngiving him, for his only sustenance, that audacious thought. Upon what\r\ncould that wounded, misunderstood heart subsist, who encountered new\r\nnecessities at every turn and found a refuge nowhere? from whom could he\r\nexpect a glance, a smile of love, if not from you, whose lover and\r\nfather he was at the same time?\r\n\r\n"Do not be shocked to find that you grew up under the wing of a poor\r\nbird consumed by love; never did any impure homage, any blameworthy\r\nthought endanger the virginity of your soul; never did my mouth brush\r\nfrom your cheeks that bloom of innocence which covered them as the fruit\r\nis covered with a moist vapor in the morning. My kisses were the kisses\r\nof a father, and when your innocent and playful lips met mine they did\r\nnot find there the stinging flame of virile desire. No, it was not with\r\nyou, a tiny blue-eyed child, that I was in love. As I held you in my\r\narms, with your innocent smile and your dainty caresses, you were simply\r\nmy child, or at most my little sister; but I was in love with your\r\nfifteen years, when, yielding to the ardor of my own youth, I devoured\r\nthe future with a greedy eye.\r\n\r\n"When I read you the story of Paul and Virginie, you only half\r\nunderstood it. You wept, however; you saw only the story of a brother\r\nand sister where I had quivered with sympathy, realizing the torments of\r\ntwo lovers. That book made me miserable, whereas it was your joy. You\r\nenjoyed hearing me read of the attachment of a faithful dog, of the\r\nbeauty of the cocoa-palms and the songs of Dominique the negro. But I,\r\nwhen I was alone, read over and over the conversations between Paul and\r\nhis sweetheart, the impulsive suspicions of the one, the secret\r\nsufferings of the other. Oh! how well I understood those first anxieties\r\nof youth, seeking in his own heart an explanation of the mysteries of\r\nlife, and seizing enthusiastically on the first object of love that\r\npresents itself to him! But do me justice, Indiana--I did not commit the\r\ncrime of hastening by a single day the placid development of your\r\nchildhood; I did not let a word escape me which could suggest to you\r\nthat there were such things as tears and misery in life. I left you, at\r\nthe age of ten, in all the ignorance, all the security that were yours\r\nwhen your nurse placed you in my arms, one day when I had determined to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n"Often as I sat alone on this cliff I wrung my hands frantically as I\r\nlistened to all the sounds of spring time and of love which the mountain\r\ngives forth, as I saw the creepers chase each other to and fro, the\r\ninsects sleeping in a voluptuous embrace in the calyx of a flower, as I\r\ninhaled the burning dust which the palm-trees sent to one\r\nanother--ethereal transports, subtle joys to which the gentle summer\r\nbreeze serves as a couch. At such times I was frantic, I was mad. I\r\nappealed for love to the flowers, to the birds, to the voice of the\r\ntorrent. I called wildly upon that unknown bliss, the mere thought of\r\nwhich made my brain whirl. But I would see you running toward me, along\r\nyonder path, merry and laughing, so tiny in the distance and so awkward\r\nabout climbing the rocks that one might have taken you for a penguin,\r\nwith your white dress and your brown hair. Then my blood would grow\r\ncalm, my lips cease to burn. In presence of the little Indiana of seven\r\nI would forget the Indiana of fifteen of whom I had just been dreaming.\r\nI would open my arms to you with pure delight; your kisses would cool my\r\nforehead. At those times I was happy; I was a father.\r\n\r\n"How many free, peaceful days we have passed in this ravine! How many\r\ntimes I have bathed your feet in the pure water of yonder basin! How\r\nmany times I have watched you sleeping among the reeds, shaded by the\r\nleaf of a palm for an umbrella! It was at those times that my tortures\r\nwould occasionally begin anew. It was a sore affliction to me that you\r\nwere so small. I would ask myself whether, suffering as I did, I could\r\nlive until the day when you could understand me and respond to my love.\r\nI would gently lift your silken locks and kiss them with passion. I\r\nwould compare them with curls I had cut from your head in preceding\r\nyears and which I kept in my wallet. I would joyously make sure of the\r\ndarker shade that each recurring spring gave to them. Then I would\r\nexamine the marks on the trunk of a date-tree nearby, that I had made to\r\nshow the progressive increase in your height for four or five years. The\r\ntree still bears those scars, Indiana; I found them on it the last time\r\nI came here to suffer. Alas! in vain did you grow taller and taller; in\r\nvain did your beauty keep all its promises; in vain did your hair become\r\nblack as ebony. You did not grow for me; not for me did your charms\r\ndevelop. The first time that your heart beat faster it was for another\r\nthan me.\r\n\r\n"Do you remember how we ran, as light of foot as two turtle-doves, among\r\nthe thickets of wild rose bushes? Do you remember, too, that we\r\nsometimes went astray in the forests over our heads? Once we tried to\r\nreach the mist-enveloped peaks of the Salazes; but we had not foreseen\r\nthat the higher we went the scarcer the fruit became, the less\r\naccessible the streams, the more terrible and more penetrating the cold.\r\n\r\n"When we saw the vegetation receding behind us you would have returned;\r\nbut when we had crossed the fern belt we found a quantity of wild\r\nstrawberries, and you were so busy filling your basket with them that\r\nyou thought no more about leaving the place. But we had to abandon the\r\nidea of going on. We were walking on volcanic rocks covered with little\r\nbrown spots, and with woolly plants growing among them. Those wretched\r\nwind-beaten weeds made us think of the goodness of God, who has given\r\nthem a warm garment to withstand the violence of the storm. Then the\r\nmist became so dense that we could not tell where we were going, and we\r\nhad to go down again. I carried you in my arms. I crept carefully down\r\nthe deep slopes of the mountain. Darkness surprised us as we entered the\r\nfirst woods, in the third belt of vegetation. I picked some pomegranates\r\nfor you and made shift to quench my own thirst with the convolvuli, the\r\nstalks of which contain an abundant supply of cool, pure water.\r\nThereupon we recalled the adventure of our favorite heroes, when they\r\nlost themselves in the forests of the Rivi\xc3\xa8re-Rouge. But we had no\r\nloving mothers, nor zealous servants, nor faithful dog to search for us.\r\nBut I was content; I was proud. I shared with no one the duty of\r\nwatching over you, and I considered myself more fortunate than Paul.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was a profound and pure and true passion that you inspired in\r\nme even then. Noun, at ten years, was a head taller than you; a creole\r\nin the fullest acceptation of the word, she was already developed. Her\r\nmelting eyes already shone with a curious expression; her bearing and\r\ncharacter were those of a young woman. But I did not love Noun, or I\r\nloved her only because of you, with whom she always played. It never\r\noccurred to me to wonder whether she was beautiful already; whether she\r\nwould be more beautiful some day. I never looked at her. In my eyes she\r\nwas more of a child than you; for, you see, I loved you. I staked all my\r\nhopes upon you; you were the companion of my life, the dream of my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n"Those days of exile in England, that period of pain and grief, I will\r\nnot describe. If I treated any one badly, it was not you; and if any one\r\ntreated me badly, I do not propose to complain. There I became more\r\n_egotistical_ that is to say more depressed and more distrustful than\r\never. By being suspicious of me, people had compelled me to become\r\nself-sufficient and to rely upon myself. Thus I had only the testimony\r\nof my own heart to support me in those trials. It was attributed to me\r\nas a crime that I did not love a woman who married me only because she\r\nwas forced to and who never treated me with anything but contempt. It\r\nwas afterwards remarked that one of the principal characteristics of my\r\negotism was the aversion I seemed to feel for children. Raymon more than\r\nonce bantered me cruelly concerning that supposed peculiarity, observing\r\nthat the care necessary for the education of children was quite\r\ninconsistent with the rigidly methodical ways of an old bachelor. I\r\nfancy that he did not know that I had been a father, and that it was I\r\nwho educated you. But none of you would ever understand that the memory\r\nof my son was as intensely painful to me after many years as on the\r\nfirst day, and that my sore heart swelled at the sight of flaxen heads\r\nthat reminded me of him. When a man is unhappy, people are terribly\r\nafraid of not finding him blameworthy enough, because they dread being\r\ncompelled to pity him.\r\n\r\n"But what no one will ever be able to understand is the profound\r\nindignation, the black despair which took possession of me when I, a\r\npoor child of the desert, upon whom no one had ever deigned to cast a\r\npitying glance, was forced to leave this spot and take upon myself the\r\nburdens of society; when I was told that I must fill an empty place that\r\nhad spurned me; when they tried to make me understand that I had duties\r\nto fulfil toward those men and women who had disregarded their duties\r\ntoward me. Think of it! no one of all my kindred had chosen to be my\r\nprotector and now they all called upon me to undertake the defence of\r\ntheir interests! They would not even leave me to enjoy in peace what\r\npariahs enjoy, the air of solitude! I had but one thing in life that I\r\ncherished, one thought, one hope--that you would belong to me forever;\r\nthey deprived me of that, they told me that you were not rich enough for\r\nme. Bitter mockery! for me whom the mountains had nourished and whom my\r\nfather\'s roof had cast out! me, who had never been allowed to learn the\r\nuse of riches, and upon whom was now laid the duty of managing to\r\nadvantage the riches of other people!\r\n\r\n"However I submitted. I had no right to pray that my paltry happiness\r\nmight be spared; I was despised enough, Heaven knows! to resist would\r\nhave been to make myself odious. My mother, inconsolable for her other\r\nson\'s death, threatened to die herself if I did not follow out my\r\ndestiny. My father, who accused me of not knowing how to comfort him, as\r\nif I were to blame because he loved me so little, was ready to curse me\r\nif I tried to escape from his yoke. I bent my head; but what I suffered\r\neven you yourself, although you too have been very unhappy, could never\r\nunderstand. If, after being hunted and maltreated and oppressed as I\r\nhave been, I have not returned mankind evil for evil, perhaps it is a\r\nfair conclusion that my heart is not so cold and sterile as it has been\r\naccused of being.\r\n\r\n"When I came back here, when I saw the man to whom you had been\r\nmarried--forgive me, Indiana, that was the time when I was genuinely\r\nselfish; there must always be selfishness in love, since there was a\r\ntouch of it even in mine--I felt an indescribably cruel joy in the\r\nthought that that legal sham would give you a master and not a husband.\r\nYou were surprised at the species of affection for him I displayed; it\r\nwas because I did not look upon him as a rival. I knew well enough that\r\nthat old man could neither feel nor inspire love, and that your heart\r\nwould come forth untouched from that marriage. I was grateful to him for\r\nyour coldness and your melancholy. If he had remained here, I should\r\nperhaps have become a very guilty man; but you left me alone and it was\r\nnot in my power to live without you. I tried to conquer the indomitable\r\nlove which had sprung to life again in all its force when I found you as\r\nfair and sad as I had dreamed of you in your childhood. But solitude\r\nonly intensified my suffering and I yielded to the craving I felt to see\r\nyou, to live under the same roof, to breathe the same air, to drink my\r\nfill every hour of the melodious tones of your voice. You know what\r\nobstacles I had to meet, what distrust I had to overcome; I realized\r\nthen what duties I had voluntarily undertaken; I could not connect my\r\nlife with yours without quieting your husband\'s suspicions by a sacred\r\npromise, and I have never known what it was to trifle with my word. I\r\npledged myself therefore with my mind and my heart never to forget my\r\nr\xc3\xb4le of brother, and I ask you, Indiana, if I ever was false to my\r\noath.\r\n\r\n"I realized also that it would be difficult, perhaps impossible, for me\r\nto perform that painful task, if I laid aside the disguise that\r\nprecluded any intimate relations, any profound sentiment; I realized\r\nthat I must not play with the danger, for my passion was too intense to\r\ncome forth victorious from a battle. I felt that I must erect about\r\nmyself a triple wall of ice, in order to repel your interest in me, in\r\norder to deprive myself of your compassion, which would have ruined me.\r\nI said to myself that on the day that you pitied me, I should be already\r\nguilty, and I made up my mind to live under the weight of that horrible\r\naccusation of indifference and selfishness, which, thank Heaven! you did\r\nnot fail to bring against me. The success of my ruse surpassed my hopes;\r\nyou lavished upon me a sort of insulting pity like that which is\r\naccorded to eunuchs; you denied me the possession of a heart and\r\npassions; you trampled me under foot, and I had not the right to display\r\nenergy enough to be angry and vow vengeance, for that would have\r\nbetrayed me and shown you that I was a man.\r\n\r\n"I complain of mankind at large and not of you, Indiana. You were always\r\nkind and merciful; you tolerated me under this despicable disguise I had\r\nadopted in order to be near you; you never made me blush for my r\xc3\xb4le,\r\nyou were all in all to me, and sometimes I thought with pride that if\r\nyou looked kindly upon me in the guise I had assumed in order that you\r\nmight misunderstand me, you might perhaps love me if you should know me\r\nsome day as I really was. Alas! what other than you would not have\r\nspurned me? what other would have held out her hand to that speechless,\r\nwitless clown? Everybody but you held aloof with disgust from the\r\n_egotist!_ Ah! there was one being in the world generous enough not to\r\ntire of that profitless exchange; there was one heart large enough to\r\nshed something of the blessed flame that animated it upon the narrow,\r\nbenumbed heart of the poor abandoned wretch. It required a heart that\r\nhad too much of that of which I had not enough. There was under Heaven\r\nbut one Indiana capable of caring for a Ralph.\r\n\r\n"Next to you the person who showed me the most indulgence was Delmare.\r\nYou accused me of preferring him to you, of sacrificing your comfort to\r\nmy own by refusing to interfere in your domestic quarrels. Unjust, blind\r\nwoman! you did not see that I served you as well as it was possible to\r\ndo; and, above all, you did not understand that I could not raise my\r\nvoice in your behalf without betraying myself. What would have become of\r\nyou if Delmare had turned me out of his house? who would have protected\r\nyou, patiently, silently, but with the persevering steadfastness of an\r\nundying love? Not Raymon surely. And then I was fond of him from a\r\nfeeling of gratitude, I confess;--yes, fond of that rough, vulgar\r\ncreature who had it in his power to deprive me of my only remaining joy,\r\nand who did not do it; that man whose misfortune it was not to be loved\r\nby you, so that there was a secret bond of sympathy between us! I was\r\nfond of him too for the very reason that he had never caused me the\r\ntortures of jealousy.\r\n\r\n"But I have come now to the most ghastly sorrow of my life, to the fatal\r\ntime when your love, of which I had dreamed so long, belonged to\r\nanother. Then and not till then did I fully realize the nature of the\r\nsentiment that I had held in check so many years. Then did hatred pour\r\npoison into my breast and jealousy consume what was left of my strength.\r\nHitherto my imagination had kept you pure; my respect encompassed you\r\nwith a veil which the innocent audacity of dreams dared not even raise;\r\nbut when I was assailed by the horrible thought that another had\r\ninvolved you in his destiny, had snatched you from my power and was\r\nintoxicating himself with deep draughts of the bliss of which I dared\r\nnot I even dream, I became frantic; I would have rejoiced to see that\r\ndetested man at the foot of this precipice and to roll stones down upon\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n"However your sufferings were so great that I forgot my own. I did not\r\nchoose to kill him, because you would have wept for him. Indeed I was\r\ntempted twenty times, Heaven forgive me! to be a vile and despicable\r\nwretch, to betray Delmare and serve my enemy. Yes, Indiana, I was so\r\ninsane, so miserable at the sight of your suffering, that I repented\r\nhaving tried to enlighten you and that I would have given my life to\r\nbequeath my heart to that man! Oh! the villain! may God forgive him for\r\nthe injury he has done me! but may He punish him for the misery he has\r\nheaped on your head! It is for that that I hate him; for, so far as I am\r\nconcerned, I forget what my life has been, when I see what he has made\r\nof yours. He is a man whom society should have branded on the forehead\r\non the day of his birth! whom it should have spat upon and cast out as\r\nthe hardest-hearted and vilest of men! But on the contrary, she bore it\r\naloft in triumph. Ah! I recognize mankind in that, and I ought not to be\r\nindignant; for man simply obeys his nature in adoring the deformed\r\ncreature who destroys the happiness and consideration of another.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, Indiana, forgive me! it is cruel perhaps to complain before\r\nyou, but this is the first time and the last; let me curse the\r\nungrateful wretch who has driven you to the grave. This terrible lesson\r\nwas necessary to open your eyes. In vain did a voice from Noun\'s\r\ndeathbed and Delmare\'s cry out to you: \'Beware of him, he will ruin\r\nyou!\'--you were deaf: your evil genius led you on and, dishonored as you\r\nare, public opinion condemns you and absolves him. He did all sorts of\r\nevil and no heed was paid to it. He killed Noun and you forgot it; he\r\nruined you and you forgave him. You see, he had the art to dazzle the\r\neyes and deceive the mind; his adroit, deceitful words found their way\r\nto the heart; his viper\'s glance fascinated; and if nature had given him\r\nmy metallic features and my dull intelligence she would have made a\r\nperfect man of him.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I say, may God punish him, for he was barbarous to you! or,\r\nrather, may He forgive him, for perhaps he was more stupid than wicked!\r\nHe did not understand you; he did not appreciate the happiness he might\r\nhave enjoyed! Oh! you loved him so dearly! He might have made your life\r\nso beautiful! In his place I would not have been virtuous; I would have\r\nfled with you into the heart of the mountains; I would have torn you\r\nfrom society to have you all to myself, and I should have had but one\r\nfear, that you would not be accursed and abandoned sufficiently so that\r\nI might be all in all to you. I would have been jealous of your\r\nconsideration, but not in the same way that he was; my aim would have\r\nbeen to destroy it in order to replace it by my love. I should have\r\nsuffered intensely to see another man give you the slightest morsel of\r\npleasure, a moment\'s gratification; it would have been a theft from me;\r\nfor your happiness would have been my care, my property, my life, my\r\nhonor! Oh! how vain and how wealthy I would have been with this wild\r\nravine for my only home, these mountain trees for my only fortune, if\r\nheaven had given them to me with your love! Let us weep, Indiana; it is\r\nthe first time in my life that I have wept; it is God\'s will that I\r\nshould not die without knowing that melancholy pleasure."\r\n\r\nRalph was weeping like a child. It was in very truth the first time that\r\nstoical soul had ever given way to self-compassion; and yet there was in\r\nthose tears more sorrow for Indiana\'s fate than for his own.\r\n\r\n"Do not weep for me," he said, seeing that her face too was bathed in\r\ntears. "Do not pity me; your pity wipes out the whole past, and the\r\npresent is no longer bitter. Why should I suffer now? You no longer love\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"If I had known you as you are, Ralph, I should never have loved him,"\r\ncried Madame Delmare; "it was your virtue that was my ruin."\r\n\r\n"And then," continued Ralph, looking at her with a sorrowful smile, "I\r\nhave many other causes of joy. You unwittingly confided something to me\r\nduring the hours that we poured out our hearts to each other on board\r\nship. You told me that this Raymon was never so fortunate as he had the\r\npresumption to claim to be, and you relieved me of a part of my\r\ntorments. You took away my remorse for having watched over you so\r\nineffectually; for I had the insolence to try to protect you from his\r\nfascinations; and therein I insulted you, Indiana. I did not have faith\r\nin your strength; that is another crime for you to forgive."\r\n\r\n"Alas!" said Indiana, "you ask me to forgive! me who have made your\r\nwhole life miserable, who have rewarded so pure and generous a love with\r\nincredible blindness, barbarous ingratitude! Why, I am the one who\r\nshould crawl at your feet and implore forgiveness."\r\n\r\n"Then this love of mine arouses neither disgust nor anger in your\r\nbreast, Indiana? O my God! I thank Thee! I shall die happy! Listen,\r\nIndiana; cease to blame yourself for my sufferings. At this moment I\r\nregret none of Raymon\'s joys, and I think that my fate would arouse his\r\nenvy if he had the heart of a man. Now I am your brother, your husband,\r\nyour lover for all eternity. Since the day that you promised to leave\r\nthis life with me, I have cherished the sweet thought that you belonged\r\nto me, that you had returned to me never to leave me again. I began once\r\nmore to call you my betrothed under my breath. It would have been too\r\nmuch happiness--or, it may be, not enough--to possess you on earth. In\r\nGod\'s bosom the bliss awaits me of which my childhood dreamed. There,\r\nIndiana, you will love me; there, your divine intellect, stripped of all\r\nthe lying fictions of this life, will make up to me for a whole life of\r\nsacrifices, suffering and self-denial; there, you will be mine, O my\r\nIndiana! for you are heaven! and if I deserve to be saved, I deserve to\r\npossess you. This is what I had in mind when I asked you to put on this\r\nwhite dress; it is the wedding dress; and yonder rock jutting out into\r\nthe basin is the altar that awaits us."\r\n\r\nHe rose and plucked a branch from a flowering orange tree in a\r\nneighboring thicket and placed it on Indiana\'s black hair; then he knelt\r\nat her feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration 06: _RALPH AND INDIANA SEEK DEATH\r\nTOGETHER_\r\n_Their lips met; and doubtless there is in a love\r\nthat comes from the heart a greater power than in\r\nthe ardor of a fugitive desire; for that kiss, on the\r\nthreshold of another life, summed up for them all\r\nthe joys of this._\r\n\r\n_Thereupon Ralph took his fianc\xc3\xa9e in his arms and\r\nbore her away to plunge with her in the torrent._]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Make me happy," he said; "tell me that your heart consents to this\r\nmarriage in another world. Give me eternity; do not compel me\r\nto pray for absolute annihilation."\r\n\r\nIf the story of Ralph\'s inward life has produced no effect upon you, if\r\nyou have not come to love that virtuous man, it is because I have proved\r\nto be an unfaithful interpreter of his memories, because I have not been\r\nable to exert the power possessed by a man who is profoundly in earnest\r\nin his passion. Moreover, the moon does not lend me its melancholy\r\ninfluence, nor do the song of the grosbeak, the perfume of the\r\ncinnamon-tree, and all the luxurious and intoxicating seductions of a\r\nnight in the tropics appeal to your head and heart. It may be, too, that\r\nyou do not know by experience what powerful and novel sensations awake\r\nin the heart at the thought of suicide, and how all the things of this\r\nlife appear in their true light at the moment of severing our connection\r\nwith them. This sudden light filled all the inmost recesses of Indiana\'s\r\nheart; the bandage, which had long been loosened, fell from her eyes\r\naltogether. Newly awake to the truth and to nature, she saw Ralph\'s\r\nheart as it really was. She also saw his features as she had never seen\r\nthem; for the mental exaltation of his position had produced the same\r\neffect on him that the Voltaic battery produces on paralyzed limbs; it\r\nhad set him free from the paralysis that had fettered his eyes and his\r\nvoice. Arrayed in all the glory of his frankness and his virtue he was\r\nmuch handsomer than Raymon, and Indiana felt that he was the man she\r\nshould have loved.\r\n\r\n"Be my husband in heaven and on earth," she said, "and let this kiss\r\nbind me to you for all eternity!"\r\n\r\nTheir lips met; and doubtless there is in a love that comes from the\r\nheart a greater power than in the ardor of a fugitive desire; for that\r\nkiss, on the threshold of another life, summed up for them all the joys\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nThereupon Ralph took his fianc\xc3\xa9e in his arms and bore her away to\r\nplunge with her in the torrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nTO J. NERAUD\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a hot, sunshiny day in January last I started from Saint-Paul and\r\nwandered into the wild forests of Ile Bourbon to muse and dream. I\r\ndreamed of you, my friend; those virgin forests had retained for me the\r\nmemory of your wanderings and your studies, the ground had kept the\r\nimprint of your feet. I found everywhere the marvellous things with\r\nwhich your magical tales charmed the tedium of my vigils in the old\r\ndays, and, in order that we might enjoy them together, I called upon old\r\nEurope, where obscurity encompasses you with its modest advantages, to\r\nsend you to me. Happy man, whose intellect and merits no treacherous\r\nfriend has made known to the world!\r\n\r\nI walked in the direction of a lonely spot in the highest part of the\r\nisland, called _Brul\xc3\xa9 de Saint-Paul._\r\n\r\nA huge fragment of mountain, which was dislodged and fell during some\r\nvolcanic disturbance, has formed on the slope of the principal mountain\r\na sort of long arena studded with rocks arranged in the most magical\r\ndisorder, in the most extraordinary confusion. Here, a huge boulder\r\nbalances itself on a number of small fragments; there, rises a wall of\r\nslender, light, porous rocks with dentilated edges and openwork\r\ndecoration like a Moorish building; farther on, an obelisk of basalt,\r\nwhose sides an artist seems to have carved and polished, stands upon a\r\ncrenelated bastion; in another place, a gothic fortress is crumbling to\r\ndecay beside a curious, shapeless pagoda. That spot is the rendezvous of\r\nall the rough drafts of art, all the sketches of architecture; it would\r\nseem that all the geniuses of all nations and of all ages went for their\r\ninspiration to that vast work of hazard and demolition. There, doubtless\r\nsome magically elaborate design of chance gave birth to the Moorish\r\nstyle of sculpture. In the heart of the forests, art found in the\r\npalm-tree one of its most beautiful models. The _vacoa_ which anchors\r\nitself in the ground and clings to it with a hundred arms branched from\r\nits main stalk, evidently furnished the first suggestion of the plan of\r\na cathedral supported by its light flying buttresses. In the _Brul\xc3\xa9 de\r\nSaint-Paul_ all shapes, all types of beauty, all humorous and bold\r\nconceits were assembled, piled upon one another, arranged and\r\nconstructed in one tempestuous night. The spirits of air and fire\r\nundoubtedly presided over this diabolical operation; they alone could\r\ngive to their productions that awe-inspiring, fanciful, incomplete\r\ncharacter which distinguishes their works from those of man; they alone\r\ncould have piled up those monstrous boulders, moved those gigantic\r\nmasses, toyed with mountains as with grains of sand, and strewn, amid\r\ncreations which man has tried to copy, those grand conceptions of art,\r\nthose sublime contrasts impossible of realization, which seem to defy\r\nthe audacity of the artist and to say to him derisively: "Try it again."\r\n\r\nI halted at the foot of a crystallized basaltic monument, about sixty\r\nfeet high and cut with facets as if by a lapidary. At the top of this\r\nstrange object an inscription seemed to have been traced in bold\r\ncharacters by an immortal hand. Those vulcanized rocks often present\r\nthat phenomenon; long ago, when their substance, softened by the action\r\nof fire, was still warm and malleable, they received and retained the\r\nimprint of the shells and climbing plants that clung to them. These\r\nchance contacts have resulted in some strange freaks, curious\r\nhieroglyphics, mysterious characters which seem to have been stamped\r\nthere like the seal of some supernatural being, written in cabalistic\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nI stood there a long time, detained by a foolish idea that I might find\r\na meaning for those ciphers. This profitless search caused me to fall\r\ninto a profound meditation, during which I forgot that time was flying.\r\n\r\nAlready the mists were gathering about the peaks of the mountains,\r\ncreeping down the sides and rapidly shutting out their outlines. Before\r\nI had descended half way to the plateau, they reached the belt that I\r\nwas crossing and enveloped it in an impenetrable curtain. A moment later\r\na high wind came up and swept the mist away in a twinkling. Then it\r\nfell; the mist settled down once more, to be once more driven away by a\r\nterrific squall.\r\n\r\nI sought shelter from the storm in a grotto which afforded me some\r\nprotection; but another scourge came to the assistance of the wind.\r\nTorrents of rain swelled the streams, all of which flow from the summit\r\nof the mountain. In an hour, everything was inundated and the sides of\r\nthe mountain, with water pouring down on every side, formed one vast\r\ncascade which rushed madly down toward the lowlands.\r\n\r\nAfter two days of most painful and dangerous travelling, I found myself,\r\nguided by Providence, I doubt not, at the door of a house built in an\r\nexceedingly wild locality. The simple but attractive cottage had\r\nwithstood the tempest, being sheltered by a rampart of cliffs which\r\nleaned over it as if to act as an umbrella. A little lower, a waterfall\r\nplunged madly down into a ravine and formed at the bottom a brimming\r\nlake, above which, clumps of lovely trees still reared their\r\nstorm-tossed, tired heads.\r\n\r\nI knocked vigorously; but the face that appeared in the doorway made me\r\nrecoil. Before I had opened my mouth to ask for shelter the master of\r\nthe house had welcomed me gravely and silently with a wave of his hand.\r\nI entered and found myself alone with him, face to face with Sir Ralph\r\nBrown.\r\n\r\nIn the year that had passed since the _Nahandove_ brought Sir Ralph and\r\nhis companion back to the colony, he had not been seen in the town three\r\ntimes; and, as for Madame Delmare, her seclusion had been so absolute\r\nthat her existence was still a problematical matter to many of the\r\npeople. It was about the same time that I first landed at Bourbon, and\r\nmy present interview with Monsieur Brown was the second one I had had in\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\nThe first had left an ineradicable impression on me; it was at\r\nSaint-Paul, on the seashore. His features and bearing had impressed me\r\nonly slightly at first; but when, through mere idle curiosity, I\r\nquestioned the colonists concerning him, their replies were so strange,\r\nso contradictory, that I scrutinized the recluse of Bernica more\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n"He\'s a clown--a man of no education," said one; "an absolute nullity,\r\nwho has only one good quality--that of keeping his mouth shut."\r\n\r\n"He\'s an extremely well educated and profound man," said another, "but\r\ntoo strongly persuaded of his own superiority, contemptuous and\r\nconceited--so much so that he considers any words wasted that he happens\r\nto exchange with the common herd."\r\n\r\n"He\'s a man who cares for nobody but himself," said a third; "a man of\r\ninferior capacity, but not stupid; profoundly selfish and, they say,\r\nhopelessly unsociable."\r\n\r\n"Why, don\'t you know?" said a young man brought up in the colony and\r\nthoroughly imbued with the characteristic narrow-mindedness of\r\nprovincials, "he\'s a knave, a villain who poisoned his friend in the\r\nmost dastardly way in order to marry his wife."\r\n\r\nThis assertion bewildered me so that I turned to another, older\r\ncolonist, whom I knew to be possessed of considerable common sense.\r\n\r\nAs my glance eagerly requested a solution of these enigmas, he answered:\r\n\r\n"Sir Ralph was formerly an excellent man, who was not a favorite because\r\nhe was not communicative, but whom everybody esteemed. That is all I can\r\nsay about him; for, since his unfortunate experience, I have had no\r\nrelations with him."\r\n\r\n"What experience?" I inquired.\r\n\r\nHe told me about Colonel Delmare\'s sudden death, his wife\'s flight\r\nduring the same night, and Monsieur Brown\'s departure and return. The\r\nobscurity which surrounded all these circumstances had been in nowise\r\nlessened by the investigations of the authorities; there was no evidence\r\nthat the fugitive had committed the crime. The king\'s attorney had\r\nrefused to prosecute; but the partiality of the magistrates for Monsieur\r\nBrown was well known, and they had been severely criticised for not\r\nhaving at least enlightened public opinion concerning an affair which\r\nleft the reputations of two persons marred by a hateful suspicion.\r\n\r\nA fact that seemed to justify these suspicions was the furtive return of\r\nthe two accused persons and their mysterious establishment in the depths\r\nof the ravine of Bernica. They had run away at first, so it was said, to\r\ngive the affair time to die out; but public opinion had been so cold in\r\nFrance that they had been driven to return and take refuge in the\r\ndesert, to gratify their criminal attachment in peace.\r\n\r\nBut all these theories were set at naught by another fact which was\r\nvouched for by persons who seemed better informed: Madame Delmare, I was\r\ntold, had always manifested a decided coolness, almost downright\r\naversion for her cousin Monsieur Brown.\r\n\r\nI had thereupon scrutinized the hero of so many strange tales\r\ncarefully--conscientiously, if I may say so. He was sitting on a bale of\r\nmerchandise, awaiting the return of a sailor whom he had sent to make\r\nsome purchase or other for him. His eyes, blue as the sea, were gazing\r\npensively at the horizon, with such a placid and honest expression; all\r\nthe lines of his face were so perfectly in harmony with one another;\r\nnerves, muscles, blood, all seemed so tranquil, so perfect, so\r\nwell-ordered in that robust and healthy individual, that I would have\r\nsworn that all the tales were deadly insults, that he had no crime on\r\nhis conscience, that he had never had one in his mind, that his heart\r\nand his hands were as pure as his brow.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the baronet\'s distraught glance had fallen upon me, as I\r\nwas staring at him with eager and impertinent curiosity. Confused and\r\nembarrassed as a thief caught in the act, I lowered my eyes, for Sir\r\nRalph\'s expression conveyed a stern rebuke. Since then I had often\r\nthought of him, involuntarily; he had appeared in my dreams. I was\r\nconscious, as I thought of him, of that vague feeling of uneasiness,\r\nthat indescribable emotion, which are like the magnetic fluid with which\r\nan unusual destiny is encompassed.\r\n\r\nMy desire to know Sir Ralph was very real, therefore, and very keen; but\r\nI should have preferred to watch him furtively, without being seen\r\nmyself. It seemed to me that I had wronged him. The crystalline\r\nappearance of his eyes froze me with terror. It was so evident that he\r\nwas a man of towering superiority, either in virtue or in villainy, that\r\nI felt very small and mean in his presence.\r\n\r\nHis hospitality was neither showy nor vulgar. He took me to his room,\r\nlent me some clothes and clean linen; then led me to his companion, who\r\nwas awaiting us to take supper.\r\n\r\nAs I saw how young and lovely she still was--she seemed barely\r\neighteen--and admired her bloom, her grace, and her sweet voice, I felt\r\na thrill of painful emotion. I reflected that that woman was either very\r\nguilty or very unfortunate: guilty of a detestable crime or dishonored\r\nby a detestable accusation.\r\n\r\nI was detained at Bernica for a week by the overflowing of the rivers,\r\nthe inundation of the plains, the rain and the wind; and then came the\r\nsun, and it never occurred to me to leave my hosts.\r\n\r\nNeither of them could be called brilliant. They had little wit, I should\r\nsay--perhaps indeed they had none at all; but they had that quality\r\nwhich makes one\'s words impressive and pleasant to hear; they had\r\nintellect of the heart. Indiana is ignorant, but not with that narrow,\r\nvulgar ignorance which proceeds from indolence, from carelessness or\r\nnullity of character. She is eager to learn what the engrossing\r\npreoccupations of her life had prevented her from finding out; and then,\r\ntoo, there may have been a little coquetry in the way she questioned Sir\r\nRalph, in order to bring into the light her friend\'s vast stores of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nI found her playful, but without petulance; her manners have retained a\r\ntrace of the languor and melancholy natural to creoles, but in her they\r\nseemed to me to have a more abiding charm; her eyes especially have an\r\nincomparably soft expression and seem to tell the story of a life of\r\nsuffering; and when her mouth smiles, there is still a touch of\r\nmelancholy in those eyes, but the melancholy that seems to be the\r\ncontemplation of happiness or the emotion of gratitude.\r\n\r\nOne morning I said to them that at last I was going away.\r\n\r\n"Already!" was their answer.\r\n\r\nThe accent of regret was so genuine, so touching, that I felt\r\nencouraged. I had determined that I would not leave Sir Ralph without\r\nasking him to tell me his story; but I felt an insurmountable timidity\r\nbecause of the horrible suspicion that had been planted in my mind.\r\n\r\nI tried to overcome it.\r\n\r\n"Men are great villains," I said to him; "they have spoken ill of you to\r\nme. I am not surprised, now that I know you. Your life must have been a\r\nvery beautiful one, to be so slandered----"\r\n\r\nI stopped abruptly when I detected an expression of innocent surprise on\r\nMadame Delmare\'s features. I understood that she knew nothing of the\r\natrocious calumnies current in the colony, and I encountered upon Sir\r\nRalph\'s face an unequivocal look of haughty displeasure. I rose at once\r\nto take my leave of them, shamefaced and sad, crushed by Monsieur\r\nBrown\'s glance, which reminded me of our first meeting and the silent\r\ninterview of the same sort we had had on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nBitterly chagrined to leave that excellent man in such a frame of mind,\r\nregretting that I had annoyed and wounded him in return for the happy\r\ndays I owed to him, I felt my heart swell within me and I burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"Young man," he said, taking my hand, "remain with us another day; I\r\nhave not the courage to let the only friend we have on the island leave\r\nus in this way--I understand you," he added, after Madame Delmare had\r\nleft the room; "I will tell you my story, but not before Indiana. There\r\nare wounds which one must not re-open."\r\n\r\nThat evening we went for a walk in the woods. The trees, which had been\r\nso fresh and lovely a fortnight earlier, were entirely stripped of their\r\nleaves, but they were already covered with great resinous buds. The\r\nbirds and insects had resumed possession of their empire. The withered\r\nflowers already had young buds to replace them. The streams\r\nperseveringly carried seaward the gravel with which their beds were\r\nfilled. Everything was returning to life and health and happiness.\r\n\r\n"Just see," said Ralph to me, "with what astounding rapidity this\r\nkindly, fecund nature repairs its losses! Does it not seem as if it were\r\nashamed of the time wasted, and were determined, by dint of a lavish\r\nexpenditure of sap and vigor, to do over in a few days the work of a\r\nyear?"\r\n\r\n"And it will succeed," rejoined Madame Delmare. "I remember last year\'s\r\nstorms; at the end of a month there was no trace of them."\r\n\r\n"It is the image of a heart broken by sorrow," I said to her; "when\r\nhappiness comes back, it renews its youth and blooms again very\r\nquickly."\r\n\r\nIndiana gave me her hand and looked at Monsieur Brown with an\r\nindescribable expression of affection and joy.\r\n\r\nWhen night fell she went to her room, and Sir Ralph, bidding me sit\r\nbeside him on a bench in the garden, told me his history to the point at\r\nwhich we dropped it in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThere he made a long pause and seemed to have forgotten my presence\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nImpelled by my interest in his narrative, I decided to interrupt his\r\nmeditation by one last question.\r\n\r\nHe started like a man suddenly awakened; then, smiling pleasantly, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n"My young friend, there are memories which we rob of their bloom by\r\nputting them in words. Let it suffice you to know that I was fully\r\ndetermined to kill Indiana with myself. But doubtless the consummation\r\nof our sacrifice was still unrecorded in the archives of Heaven. A\r\ndoctor would tell you perhaps that a very natural attack of vertigo took\r\npossession of my wits and led me astray as to the location of the path.\r\nFor my own part, who am not a doctor at all in such matters, I prefer to\r\nbelieve that the angel of Abraham and Tobias, that beautiful white angel\r\nwith the blue eyes and the girdle of gold, whom you often saw in your\r\nchildish dreams, came down from Heaven on a moonbeam, and, as he hovered\r\nin the trembling vapor of the cataract, stretched his silvery wings over\r\nmy gentle companion\'s head. The only thing that I am able to tell you is\r\nthat the moon sank behind the great peaks of the mountain and no ominous\r\nsound disturbed the peaceful murmur of the waterfall; the birds on the\r\ncliff did not take their flight until a white streak appeared on the\r\nhorizon; and the first ruddy beam that fell upon the clump of\r\norange-trees found me on my knees blessing God.\r\n\r\n"Do not think, however, that I accepted instantly the unhoped-for\r\nhappiness which gave a new turn to my destiny. I was afraid to sound the\r\nradiant future that was dawning for me; and when Indiana raised her eyes\r\nand smiled upon me, I pointed to the waterfall and talked of dying.\r\n\r\n"\'If you do not regret having lived until this morning,\' I said to her,\r\n\'we can both declare that we have tasted happiness in all its plenitude;\r\nand it is an additional reason for ceasing to live, for perhaps my star\r\nwould pale to-morrow. Who can say that, on leaving this spot, on coming\r\nforth from this intoxicating situation to which thoughts of death and\r\nlove have brought me, I shall not become once more the detestable brute\r\nwhom you despised yesterday? Will you not blush for yourself when you\r\nfind me again as you have always known me? Oh! Indiana, spare me that\r\nhorrible agony; it would be the complement of my destiny.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Do you doubt your heart, Ralph?\' said Indiana with an adorable\r\nexpression of love and confidence, \'or does not mine offer you\r\nsufficient guarantee?\'\r\n\r\n"Shall I tell you? I was not happy at first. I did not doubt Madame\r\nDelmare\'s sincerity, but I was terrified by thought of the future.\r\nHaving distrusted myself beyond measure for thirty years, I could not\r\nfeel assured in a single day of my ability to please and to retain her\r\nlove. I had moments of uncertainty, alarm and bitterness; I sometimes\r\nregretted that I had not jumped into the lake when a word from Indiana\r\nhad made me so happy.\r\n\r\n"She too must have had attacks of melancholy. She found it difficult to\r\nbreak herself of the habit of suffering, for the heart becomes used to\r\nunhappiness, it takes root in it and cuts loose from it only with an\r\neffort. However, I must do her heart the justice to say that she never\r\nhad a regret for Raymon; she did not even remember him enough to hate\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"At last, as always happens in deep and true attachments, time, instead\r\nof weakening our love, established it firmly and sealed it; each day\r\ngave it added intensity, because each day brought fresh obligations on\r\nboth sides to esteem and to bless. All our fears vanished one by one;\r\nand when we saw how easy it was to destroy those causes of distrust, we\r\nsmilingly confessed to each other that we took our happiness like\r\ncowards and that neither of us deserved it. From that moment we have\r\nloved each other in perfect security."\r\n\r\nRalph paused; then, after a few moments of profound meditation in which\r\nwe were equally absorbed, he continued, pressing my hand:\r\n\r\n"I say nothing of my happiness; if there are griefs that never betray\r\ntheir existence and envelop the heart like a shroud, so there are joys\r\nthat remain buried in the heart of man because no earthly voice can\r\ndescribe them. Moreover, if some angel from heaven should light upon one\r\nof these flowering branches and describe those joys in the language of\r\nhis native land, you would not understand them, young man, for the\r\ntempest has not bruised and shattered you. Alas! what can the heart that\r\nhas not suffered understand of happiness? As to our crimes----" he added\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" I cried, my eyes wet with tears.\r\n\r\n"Listen, monsieur," he continued, interrupting me; "you have lived but a\r\nfew hours with the two outlaws of Bernica, but a single hour would\r\nsuffice for you to learn their whole life. All our days resemble one\r\nanother; they are all calm and lovely; they pass by as swiftly and as\r\npure as those of our childhood. Every night we bless God; we pray to him\r\nevery morning, we implore at his hands the sunshine and shade of the day\r\nbefore. The greater part of our income is devoted to the redemption of\r\npoor and infirm blacks. That is the principal cause of the evil that the\r\ncolonists say of us. Would that we were rich enough to set free all\r\nthose who live in slavery! Our servants are our friends; they share our\r\njoys, we nurse them in sickness. This is the way our life is spent,\r\nwithout vexations, without remorse. We rarely speak of the past, rarely\r\nof the future; but always of the former without bitterness, of the\r\nlatter without alarm. If we sometimes surprise ourselves with tears in\r\nour eyes, it is because great joys always cause tears to flow; the eyes\r\nare dry in great misery."\r\n\r\n"My friend," I said after a long silence, "if the accusations of the\r\nworld should reach your ears, your happiness would answer loudly\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"You are young," he replied, "in your eyes, for your conscience is\r\ningenuous and pure and unsoiled by the world, our happiness is the proof\r\nof our virtue; in the eyes of the world it is our crime. Solitude is\r\nsweet, I tell you, and men are not worth a regret."\r\n\r\n"All do not accuse you," I said; "but even those who appreciate your\r\ntrue character blame you for despising public opinion, and those who\r\nacknowledge your virtue say that you are arrogant and proud."\r\n\r\n"Believe me," replied Ralph, "there is more pride in that reproach than\r\nin any alleged scorn. As for public opinion, monsieur, judging from\r\nthose whom it exalts, ought we not always to hold out our hand to those\r\nwhom it tramples upon? It is said that its approval is necessary to\r\nhappiness; they who think so should respect it. For my part, I sincerely\r\npity any happiness that rises or falls with its capricious breath."\r\n\r\n"Some moralists criticise your solitary life; they claim that every man\r\nbelongs to society, which demands his presence. They add that you set an\r\nexample which it is dangerous to follow."\r\n\r\n"Society should demand nothing of the man who expects nothing from it,"\r\nSir Ralph replied. "As for the contagion of example, I do not believe in\r\nit, monsieur; too much energy is required to break with the world, and\r\ntoo much suffering to acquire that energy. So let this unknown happiness\r\nflow on in peace, for it costs nobody anything, and conceals itself for\r\nfear of making others envious. Go, young man, follow the course of your\r\ndestiny; have friends, a profession, a reputation, a fatherland. As for\r\nme, I have Indiana. Do not break the chains that bind you to society,\r\nrespect its laws if they protect you, accept its judgments if they are\r\nfair to you: but if some day it calumniates you and spurns you, have\r\npride enough to find a way to do without it."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said I, "a pure heart will enable us to endure exile; but, to\r\nmake us love it, one must have such a companion as yours."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" he said, "if you knew how I pity this world of yours, which looks\r\ndown on me!"\r\n\r\nThe next day I left Ralph and Indiana; one embraced me, the other shed a\r\nfew tears.\r\n\r\n"Adieu," they said to me; "return to the world; if some day it banishes\r\nyou, remember our Indian cottage."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Indiana, by George Sand\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK INDIANA ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 63445-0.txt or 63445-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/6/3/4/4/63445/\r\n\r\nProduced by Dagny and Laura Natal Rodrigues at Free\r\nLiterature (Images generously made available by Hathi\r\nTrust.)\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\r\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\r\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\r\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
