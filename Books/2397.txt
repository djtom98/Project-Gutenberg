The first two, Miss Keller\'s story and the\r\nextracts from her letters, form a complete account of her life as far as\r\nshe can give it. Much of her education she cannot explain herself, and\r\nsince a knowledge of that is necessary to an understanding of what she\r\nhas written, it was thought best to supplement her autobiography with\r\nthe reports and letters of her teacher, Miss Anne Mansfield Sullivan.\r\nThe addition of a further account of Miss Keller\'s personality and\r\nachievements may be unnecessary; yet it will help to make clear some of\r\nthe traits of her character and the nature of the work which she and her\r\nteacher have done.\r\n\r\nFor the third part of the book the Editor is responsible, though all\r\nthat is valid in it he owes to authentic records and to the advice of\r\nMiss Sullivan.\r\n\r\nThe Editor desires to express his gratitude and the gratitude of Miss\r\nKeller and Miss Sullivan to The Ladies\' Home Journal and to its editors,\r\nMr. Edward Bok and Mr. William V. Alexander, who have been unfailingly\r\nkind and have given for use in this book all the photographs which were\r\ntaken expressly for the Journal; and the Editor thanks Miss Keller\'s\r\nmany friends who have lent him her letters to them and given him\r\nvaluable information; especially Mrs. Laurence Hutton, who supplied\r\nhim with her large collection of notes and anecdotes; Mr. John Hitz,\r\nSuperintendent of the Volta Bureau for the Increase and Diffusion of\r\nKnowledge relating to the Deaf; and Mrs. Sophia C. Hopkins, to whom Miss\r\nSullivan wrote those illuminating letters, the extracts from which give\r\na better idea of her methods with her pupil than anything heretofore\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Houghton, Mifflin and Company have courteously permitted the\r\nreprinting of Miss Keller\'s letter to Dr. Holmes, which appeared in\r\n"Over the Teacups," and one of Whittier\'s letters to Miss Keller.

THE STORY OF MY LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIt is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life.\r\nI have, as it were, a superstitious hesitation in lifting the veil that\r\nclings about my childhood like a golden mist. The task of writing an\r\nautobiography is a difficult one. When I try to classify my earliest\r\nimpressions, I find that fact and fancy look alike across the years that\r\nlink the past with the present. The woman paints the child\'s experiences\r\nin her own fantasy. A few impressions stand out vividly from the first\r\nyears of my life; but "the shadows of the prison-house are on the rest."\r\nBesides, many of the joys and sorrows of childhood have lost their\r\npoignancy; and many incidents of vital importance in my early education\r\nhave been forgotten in the excitement of great discoveries. In order,\r\ntherefore, not to be tedious I shall try to present in a series of\r\nsketches only the episodes that seem to me to be the most interesting\r\nand important.\r\n\r\nI was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, a little town of northern\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\nThe family on my father\'s side is descended from Caspar Keller, a native\r\nof Switzerland, who settled in Maryland. One of my Swiss ancestors was\r\nthe first teacher of the deaf in Zurich and wrote a book on the subject\r\nof their education--rather a singular coincidence; though it is true\r\nthat there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors, and\r\nno slave who has not had a king among his.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, Caspar Keller\'s son, "entered" large tracts of land in\r\nAlabama and finally settled there. I have been told that once a year he\r\nwent from Tuscumbia to Philadelphia on horseback to purchase supplies\r\nfor the plantation, and my aunt has in her possession many of the\r\nletters to his family, which give charming and vivid accounts of these\r\ntrips.\r\n\r\nMy Grandmother Keller was a daughter of one of Lafayette\'s aides,\r\nAlexander Moore, and granddaughter of Alexander Spotswood, an early\r\nColonial Governor of Virginia. She was also second cousin to Robert E.\r\nLee.\r\n\r\nMy father, Arthur H. Keller, was a captain in the Confederate Army, and\r\nmy mother, Kate Adams, was his second wife and many years younger. Her\r\ngrandfather, Benjamin Adams, married Susanna E. Goodhue, and lived in\r\nNewbury, Massachusetts, for many years. Their son, Charles Adams, was\r\nborn in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and moved to Helena, Arkansas. When\r\nthe Civil War broke out, he fought on the side of the South and became\r\na brigadier-general. He married Lucy Helen Everett, who belonged to the\r\nsame family of Everetts as Edward Everett and Dr. Edward Everett Hale.\r\nAfter the war was over the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nI lived, up to the time of the illness that deprived me of my sight and\r\nhearing, in a tiny house consisting of a large square room and a small\r\none, in which the servant slept. It is a custom in the South to build a\r\nsmall house near the homestead as an annex to be used on occasion. Such\r\na house my father built after the Civil War, and when he married my\r\nmother they went to live in it. It was completely covered with vines,\r\nclimbing roses and honeysuckles. From the garden it looked like an\r\narbour. The little porch was hidden from view by a screen of yellow\r\nroses and Southern smilax. It was the favourite haunt of humming-birds\r\nand bees.\r\n\r\nThe Keller homestead, where the family lived, was a few steps from our\r\nlittle rose-bower. It was called "Ivy Green" because the house and the\r\nsurrounding trees and fences were covered with beautiful English ivy.\r\nIts old-fashioned garden was the paradise of my childhood.\r\n\r\nEven in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square\r\nstiff boxwood hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell would find the\r\nfirst violets and lilies. There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to\r\nfind comfort and to hide my hot face in the cool leaves and grass. What\r\njoy it was to lose myself in that garden of flowers, to wander happily\r\nfrom spot to spot, until, coming suddenly upon a beautiful vine, I\r\nrecognized it by its leaves and blossoms, and knew it was the vine which\r\ncovered the tumble-down summer-house at the farther end of the garden!\r\nHere, also, were trailing clematis, drooping jessamine, and some rare\r\nsweet flowers called butterfly lilies, because their fragile petals\r\nresemble butterflies\' wings. But the roses--they were loveliest of all.\r\nNever have I found in the greenhouses of the North such heart-satisfying\r\nroses as the climbing roses of my southern home. They used to hang\r\nin long festoons from our porch, filling the whole air with their\r\nfragrance, untainted by any earthy smell; and in the early morning,\r\nwashed in the dew, they felt so soft, so pure, I could not help\r\nwondering if they did not resemble the asphodels of God\'s garden.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of my life was simple and much like every other little\r\nlife. I came, I saw, I conquered, as the first baby in the family always\r\ndoes. There was the usual amount of discussion as to a name for me.\r\nThe first baby in the family was not to be lightly named, every one was\r\nemphatic about that. My father suggested the name of Mildred Campbell,\r\nan ancestor whom he highly esteemed, and he declined to take any further\r\npart in the discussion. My mother solved the problem by giving it as\r\nher wish that I should be called after her mother, whose maiden name was\r\nHelen Everett. But in the excitement of carrying me to church my father\r\nlost the name on the way, very naturally, since it was one in which he\r\nhad declined to have a part. When the minister asked him for it, he just\r\nremembered that it had been decided to call me after my grandmother, and\r\nhe gave her name as Helen Adams.\r\n\r\nI am told that while I was still in long dresses I showed many signs of\r\nan eager, self-asserting disposition. Everything that I saw other people\r\ndo I insisted upon imitating. At six months I could pipe out "How d\'ye,"\r\nand one day I attracted every one\'s attention by saying "Tea, tea, tea"\r\nquite plainly. Even after my illness I remembered one of the words I had\r\nlearned in these early months. It was the word "water," and I continued\r\nto make some sound for that word after all other speech was lost. I\r\nceased making the sound "wah-wah" only when I learned to spell the word.\r\n\r\nThey tell me I walked the day I was a year old. My mother had just\r\ntaken me out of the bath-tub and was holding me in her lap, when I was\r\nsuddenly attracted by the flickering shadows of leaves that danced in\r\nthe sunlight on the smooth floor. I slipped from my mother\'s lap and\r\nalmost ran toward them. The impulse gone, I fell down and cried for her\r\nto take me up in her arms.\r\n\r\nThese happy days did not last long. One brief spring, musical with the\r\nsong of robin and mocking-bird, one summer rich in fruit and roses, one\r\nautumn of gold and crimson sped by and left their gifts at the feet of\r\nan eager, delighted child. Then, in the dreary month of February,\r\ncame the illness which closed my eyes and ears and plunged me into the\r\nunconsciousness of a new-born baby. They called it acute congestion of\r\nthe stomach and brain. The doctor thought I could not live. Early one\r\nmorning, however, the fever left me as suddenly and mysteriously as it\r\nhad come. There was great rejoicing in the family that morning, but no\r\none, not even the doctor, knew that I should never see or hear again.\r\n\r\nI fancy I still have confused recollections of that illness. I\r\nespecially remember the tenderness with which my mother tried to soothe\r\nme in my waling hours of fret and pain, and the agony and bewilderment\r\nwith which I awoke after a tossing half sleep, and turned my eyes, so\r\ndry and hot, to the wall away from the once-loved light, which came\r\nto me dim and yet more dim each day. But, except for these fleeting\r\nmemories, if, indeed, they be memories, it all seems very unreal, like\r\na nightmare. Gradually I got used to the silence and darkness that\r\nsurrounded me and forgot that it had ever been different, until she\r\ncame--my teacher--who was to set my spirit free. But during the first\r\nnineteen months of my life I had caught glimpses of broad, green fields,\r\na luminous sky, trees and flowers which the darkness that followed could\r\nnot wholly blot out. If we have once seen, "the day is ours, and what\r\nthe day has shown."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nI cannot recall what happened during the first months after my illness.\r\nI only know that I sat in my mother\'s lap or clung to her dress as she\r\nwent about her household duties. My hands felt every object and observed\r\nevery motion, and in this way I learned to know many things. Soon I\r\nfelt the need of some communication with others and began to make crude\r\nsigns. A shake of the head meant "No" and a nod, "Yes," a pull meant\r\n"Come" and a push, "Go." Was it bread that I wanted? Then I would\r\nimitate the acts of cutting the slices and buttering them. If I wanted\r\nmy mother to make ice-cream for dinner I made the sign for working the\r\nfreezer and shivered, indicating cold. My mother, moreover, succeeded\r\nin making me understand a good deal. I always knew when she wished me\r\nto bring her something, and I would run upstairs or anywhere else she\r\nindicated. Indeed, I owe to her loving wisdom all that was bright and\r\ngood in my long night.\r\n\r\nI understood a good deal of what was going on about me. At five I\r\nlearned to fold and put away the clean clothes when they were brought\r\nin from the laundry, and I distinguished my own from the rest. I knew\r\nby the way my mother and aunt dressed when they were going out, and I\r\ninvariably begged to go with them. I was always sent for when there was\r\ncompany, and when the guests took their leave, I waved my hand to them,\r\nI think with a vague remembrance of the meaning of the gesture. One day\r\nsome gentlemen called on my mother, and I felt the shutting of the front\r\ndoor and other sounds that indicated their arrival. On a sudden thought\r\nI ran upstairs before any one could stop me, to put on my idea of a\r\ncompany dress. Standing before the mirror, as I had seen others do, I\r\nanointed mine head with oil and covered my face thickly with powder.\r\nThen I pinned a veil over my head so that it covered my face and fell in\r\nfolds down to my shoulders, and tied an enormous bustle round my small\r\nwaist, so that it dangled behind, almost meeting the hem of my skirt.\r\nThus attired I went down to help entertain the company.\r\n\r\nI do not remember when I first realized that I was different from other\r\npeople; but I knew it before my teacher came to me. I had noticed that\r\nmy mother and my friends did not use signs as I did when they wanted\r\nanything done, but talked with their mouths. Sometimes I stood between\r\ntwo persons who were conversing and touched their lips. I could not\r\nunderstand, and was vexed. I moved my lips and gesticulated frantically\r\nwithout result. This made me so angry at times that I kicked and\r\nscreamed until I was exhausted.\r\n\r\nI think I knew when I was naughty, for I knew that it hurt Ella, my\r\nnurse, to kick her, and when my fit of temper was over I had a feeling\r\nakin to regret. But I cannot remember any instance in which this feeling\r\nprevented me from repeating the naughtiness when I failed to get what I\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nIn those days a little coloured girl, Martha Washington, the child of\r\nour cook, and Belle, an old setter, and a great hunter in her day, were\r\nmy constant companions. Martha Washington understood my signs, and I\r\nseldom had any difficulty in making her do just as I wished. It pleased\r\nme to domineer over her, and she generally submitted to my tyranny\r\nrather than risk a hand-to-hand encounter. I was strong, active,\r\nindifferent to consequences. I knew my own mind well enough and always\r\nhad my own way, even if I had to fight tooth and nail for it. We spent\r\na great deal of time in the kitchen, kneading dough balls, helping make\r\nice-cream, grinding coffee, quarreling over the cake-bowl, and feeding\r\nthe hens and turkeys that swarmed about the kitchen steps. Many of them\r\nwere so tame that they would eat from my hand and let me feel them.\r\nOne big gobbler snatched a tomato from me one day and ran away with it.\r\nInspired, perhaps, by Master Gobbler\'s success, we carried off to the\r\nwoodpile a cake which the cook had just frosted, and ate every bit of\r\nit. I was quite ill afterward, and I wonder if retribution also overtook\r\nthe turkey.\r\n\r\nThe guinea-fowl likes to hide her nest in out-of-the-way places, and it\r\nwas one of my greatest delights to hunt for the eggs in the long grass.\r\nI could not tell Martha Washington when I wanted to go egg-hunting,\r\nbut I would double my hands and put them on the ground, which meant\r\nsomething round in the grass, and Martha always understood. When we were\r\nfortunate enough to find a nest I never allowed her to carry the eggs\r\nhome, making her understand by emphatic signs that she might fall and\r\nbreak them.\r\n\r\nThe sheds where the corn was stored, the stable where the horses were\r\nkept, and the yard where the cows were milked morning and evening were\r\nunfailing sources of interest to Martha and me. The milkers would let\r\nme keep my hands on the cows while they milked, and I often got well\r\nswitched by the cow for my curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe making ready for Christmas was always a delight to me. Of course I\r\ndid not know what it was all about, but I enjoyed the pleasant odours\r\nthat filled the house and the tidbits that were given to Martha\r\nWashington and me to keep us quiet. We were sadly in the way, but that\r\ndid not interfere with our pleasure in the least. They allowed us to\r\ngrind the spices, pick over the raisins and lick the stirring spoons.\r\nI hung my stocking because the others did; I cannot remember, however,\r\nthat the ceremony interested me especially, nor did my curiosity cause\r\nme to wake before daylight to look for my gifts.\r\n\r\nMartha Washington had as great a love of mischief as I. Two little\r\nchildren were seated on the veranda steps one hot July afternoon.\r\nOne was black as ebony, with little bunches of fuzzy hair tied with\r\nshoestrings sticking out all over her head like corkscrews. The other\r\nwas white, with long golden curls. One child was six years old, the\r\nother two or three years older. The younger child was blind--that was\r\nI--and the other was Martha Washington. We were busy cutting out paper\r\ndolls; but we soon wearied of this amusement, and after cutting up our\r\nshoestrings and clipping all the leaves off the honeysuckle that were\r\nwithin reach, I turned my attention to Martha\'s corkscrews. She objected\r\nat first, but finally submitted. Thinking that turn and turn about is\r\nfair play, she seized the scissors and cut off one of my curls, and\r\nwould have cut them all off but for my mother\'s timely interference.\r\n\r\nBelle, our dog, my other companion, was old and lazy and liked to sleep\r\nby the open fire rather than to romp with me. I tried hard to teach\r\nher my sign language, but she was dull and inattentive. She sometimes\r\nstarted and quivered with excitement, then she became perfectly rigid,\r\nas dogs do when they point a bird. I did not then know why Belle acted\r\nin this way; but I knew she was not doing as I wished. This vexed me and\r\nthe lesson always ended in a one-sided boxing match. Belle would get up,\r\nstretch herself lazily, give one or two contemptuous sniffs, go to\r\nthe opposite side of the hearth and lie down again, and I, wearied and\r\ndisappointed, went off in search of Martha.\r\n\r\nMany incidents of those early years are fixed in my memory, isolated,\r\nbut clear and distinct, making the sense of that silent, aimless,\r\ndayless life all the more intense.\r\n\r\nOne day I happened to spill water on my apron, and I spread it out to\r\ndry before the fire which was flickering on the sitting-room hearth. The\r\napron did not dry quickly enough to suit me, so I drew nearer and threw\r\nit right over the hot ashes. The fire leaped into life; the flames\r\nencircled me so that in a moment my clothes were blazing. I made a\r\nterrified noise that brought Viny, my old nurse, to the rescue. Throwing\r\na blanket over me, she almost suffocated me, but she put out the fire.\r\nExcept for my hands and hair I was not badly burned.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I found out the use of a key. One morning I locked my\r\nmother up in the pantry, where she was obliged to remain three hours, as\r\nthe servants were in a detached part of the house. She kept pounding on\r\nthe door, while I sat outside on the porch steps and laughed with glee\r\nas I felt the jar of the pounding. This most naughty prank of mine\r\nconvinced my parents that I must be taught as soon as possible. After\r\nmy teacher, Miss Sullivan, came to me, I sought an early opportunity\r\nto lock her in her room. I went upstairs with something which my mother\r\nmade me understand I was to give to Miss Sullivan; but no sooner had I\r\ngiven it to her than I slammed the door to, locked it, and hid the key\r\nunder the wardrobe in the hall. I could not be induced to tell where the\r\nkey was. My father was obliged to get a ladder and take Miss Sullivan\r\nout through the window--much to my delight. Months after I produced the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nWhen I was about five years old we moved from the little vine-covered\r\nhouse to a large new one. The family consisted of my father and mother,\r\ntwo older half-brothers, and, afterward, a little sister, Mildred. My\r\nearliest distinct recollection of my father is making my way through\r\ngreat drifts of newspapers to his side and finding him alone, holding\r\na sheet of paper before his face. I was greatly puzzled to know what he\r\nwas doing. I imitated this action, even wearing his spectacles, thinking\r\nthey might help solve the mystery. But I did not find out the secret for\r\nseveral years. Then I learned what those papers were, and that my father\r\nedited one of them.\r\n\r\nMy father was most loving and indulgent, devoted to his home, seldom\r\nleaving us, except in the hunting season. He was a great hunter, I have\r\nbeen told, and a celebrated shot. Next to his family he loved his dogs\r\nand gun. His hospitality was great, almost to a fault, and he seldom\r\ncame home without bringing a guest. His special pride was the big garden\r\nwhere, it was said, he raised the finest watermelons and strawberries in\r\nthe county; and to me he brought the first ripe grapes and the choicest\r\nberries. I remember his caressing touch as he led me from tree to tree,\r\nfrom vine to vine, and his eager delight in whatever pleased me.\r\n\r\nHe was a famous story-teller; after I had acquired language he used to\r\nspell clumsily into my hand his cleverest anecdotes, and nothing pleased\r\nhim more than to have me repeat them at an opportune moment.\r\n\r\nI was in the North, enjoying the last beautiful days of the summer of\r\n1896, when I heard the news of my father\'s death. He had had a short\r\nillness, there had been a brief time of acute suffering, then all was\r\nover. This was my first great sorrow--my first personal experience with\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nHow shall I write of my mother? She is so near to me that it almost\r\nseems indelicate to speak of her.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I regarded my little sister as an intruder. I knew that\r\nI had ceased to be my mother\'s only darling, and the thought filled me\r\nwith jealousy. She sat in my mother\'s lap constantly, where I used to\r\nsit, and seemed to take up all her care and time. One day something\r\nhappened which seemed to me to be adding insult to injury.\r\n\r\nAt that time I had a much-petted, much-abused doll, which I afterward\r\nnamed Nancy. She was, alas, the helpless victim of my outbursts of\r\ntemper and of affection, so that she became much the worse for wear. I\r\nhad dolls which talked, and cried, and opened and shut their eyes; yet\r\nI never loved one of them as I loved poor Nancy. She had a cradle, and I\r\noften spent an hour or more rocking her. I guarded both doll and cradle\r\nwith the most jealous care; but once I discovered my little sister\r\nsleeping peacefully in the cradle. At this presumption on the part of\r\none to whom as yet no tie of love bound me I grew angry. I rushed upon\r\nthe cradle and over-turned it, and the baby might have been killed had\r\nmy mother not caught her as she fell. Thus it is that when we walk in\r\nthe valley of twofold solitude we know little of the tender affections\r\nthat grow out of endearing words and actions and companionship. But\r\nafterward, when I was restored to my human heritage, Mildred and I grew\r\ninto each other\'s hearts, so that we were content to go hand-in-hand\r\nwherever caprice led us, although she could not understand my finger\r\nlanguage, nor I her childish prattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the desire to express myself grew. The few signs I used became\r\nless and less adequate, and my failures to make myself understood were\r\ninvariably followed by outbursts of passion. I felt as if invisible\r\nhands were holding me, and I made frantic efforts to free myself.\r\nI struggled--not that struggling helped matters, but the spirit of\r\nresistance was strong within me; I generally broke down in tears and\r\nphysical exhaustion. If my mother happened to be near I crept into her\r\narms, too miserable even to remember the cause of the tempest. After\r\nawhile the need of some means of communication became so urgent that\r\nthese outbursts occurred daily, sometimes hourly.\r\n\r\nMy parents were deeply grieved and perplexed. We lived a long way from\r\nany school for the blind or the deaf, and it seemed unlikely that any\r\none would come to such an out-of-the-way place as Tuscumbia to teach\r\na child who was both deaf and blind. Indeed, my friends and relatives\r\nsometimes doubted whether I could be taught. My mother\'s only ray of\r\nhope came from Dickens\'s "American Notes." She had read his account of\r\nLaura Bridgman, and remembered vaguely that she was deaf and blind, yet\r\nhad been educated. But she also remembered with a hopeless pang that Dr.\r\nHowe, who had discovered the way to teach the deaf and blind, had been\r\ndead many years. His methods had probably died with him; and if they had\r\nnot, how was a little girl in a far-off town in Alabama to receive the\r\nbenefit of them?\r\n\r\nWhen I was about six years old, my father heard of an eminent oculist\r\nin Baltimore, who had been successful in many cases that had seemed\r\nhopeless. My parents at once determined to take me to Baltimore to see\r\nif anything could be done for my eyes.\r\n\r\nThe journey, which I remember well was very pleasant. I made friends\r\nwith many people on the train. One lady gave me a box of shells. My\r\nfather made holes in these so that I could string them, and for a long\r\ntime they kept me happy and contented. The conductor, too, was kind.\r\nOften when he went his rounds I clung to his coat tails while he\r\ncollected and punched the tickets. His punch, with which he let me play,\r\nwas a delightful toy. Curled up in a corner of the seat I amused myself\r\nfor hours making funny little holes in bits of cardboard.\r\n\r\nMy aunt made me a big doll out of towels. It was the most comical\r\nshapeless thing, this improvised doll, with no nose, mouth, ears or\r\neyes--nothing that even the imagination of a child could convert into a\r\nface. Curiously enough, the absence of eyes struck me more than all\r\nthe other defects put together. I pointed this out to everybody with\r\nprovoking persistency, but no one seemed equal to the task of providing\r\nthe doll with eyes. A bright idea, however, shot into my mind, and the\r\nproblem was solved. I tumbled off the seat and searched under it until\r\nI found my aunt\'s cape, which was trimmed with large beads. I pulled two\r\nbeads off and indicated to her that I wanted her to sew them on my\r\ndoll. She raised my hand to her eyes in a questioning way, and I nodded\r\nenergetically. The beads were sewed in the right place and I could not\r\ncontain myself for joy; but immediately I lost all interest in the doll.\r\nDuring the whole trip I did not have one fit of temper, there were so\r\nmany things to keep my mind and fingers busy.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived in Baltimore, Dr. Chisholm received us kindly: but\r\nhe could do nothing. He said, however, that I could be educated, and\r\nadvised my father to consult Dr. Alexander Graham Bell of Washington,\r\nwho would be able to give him information about schools and teachers\r\nof deaf or blind children. Acting on the doctor\'s advice, we went\r\nimmediately to Washington to see Dr. Bell, my father with a sad heart\r\nand many misgivings, I wholly unconscious of his anguish, finding\r\npleasure in the excitement of moving from place to place. Child as I\r\nwas, I at once felt the tenderness and sympathy which endeared Dr.\r\nBell to so many hearts, as his wonderful achievements enlist their\r\nadmiration. He held me on his knee while I examined his watch, and he\r\nmade it strike for me. He understood my signs, and I knew it and loved\r\nhim at once. But I did not dream that that interview would be the door\r\nthrough which I should pass from darkness into light, from isolation to\r\nfriendship, companionship, knowledge, love.\r\n\r\nDr. Bell advised my father to write to Mr. Anagnos, director of the\r\nPerkins Institution in Boston, the scene of Dr. Howe\'s great labours\r\nfor the blind, and ask him if he had a teacher competent to begin my\r\neducation. This my father did at once, and in a few weeks there came\r\na kind letter from Mr. Anagnos with the comforting assurance that\r\na teacher had been found. This was in the summer of 1886. But Miss\r\nSullivan did not arrive until the following March.\r\n\r\nThus I came up out of Egypt and stood before Sinai, and a power divine\r\ntouched my spirit and gave it sight, so that I beheld many wonders. And\r\nfrom the sacred mountain I heard a voice which said, "Knowledge is love\r\nand light and vision."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my\r\nteacher, Anne Mansfield Sullivan, came to me. I am filled with wonder\r\nwhen I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which\r\nit connects. It was the third of March, 1887, three months before I was\r\nseven years old.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of that eventful day, I stood on the porch, dumb,\r\nexpectant. I guessed vaguely from my mother\'s signs and from the\r\nhurrying to and fro in the house that something unusual was about to\r\nhappen, so I went to the door and waited on the steps. The afternoon sun\r\npenetrated the mass of honeysuckle that covered the porch, and fell\r\non my upturned face. My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the\r\nfamiliar leaves and blossoms which had just come forth to greet the\r\nsweet southern spring. I did not know what the future held of marvel or\r\nsurprise for me. Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for\r\nweeks and a deep languor had succeeded this passionate struggle.\r\n\r\nHave you ever been at sea in a dense fog, when it seemed as if a\r\ntangible white darkness shut you in, and the great ship, tense and\r\nanxious, groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding-line,\r\nand you waited with beating heart for something to happen? I was like\r\nthat ship before my education began, only I was without compass or\r\nsounding-line, and had no way of knowing how near the harbour was.\r\n"Light! give me light!" was the wordless cry of my soul, and the light\r\nof love shone on me in that very hour.\r\n\r\nI felt approaching footsteps, I stretched out my hand as I supposed to\r\nmy mother. Some one took it, and I was caught up and held close in the\r\narms of her who had come to reveal all things to me, and, more than all\r\nthings else, to love me.\r\n\r\nThe morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me\r\na doll. The little blind children at the Perkins Institution had sent\r\nit and Laura Bridgman had dressed it; but I did not know this until\r\nafterward. When I had played with it a little while, Miss Sullivan\r\nslowly spelled into my hand the word "d-o-l-l." I was at once interested\r\nin this finger play and tried to imitate it. When I finally succeeded\r\nin making the letters correctly I was flushed with childish pleasure and\r\npride. Running downstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made the\r\nletters for doll. I did not know that I was spelling a word or even\r\nthat words existed; I was simply making my fingers go in monkey-like\r\nimitation. In the days that followed I learned to spell in this\r\nuncomprehending way a great many words, among them pin, hat, cup and\r\na few verbs like sit, stand and walk. But my teacher had been with me\r\nseveral weeks before I understood that everything has a name.\r\n\r\nOne day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my\r\nbig rag doll into my lap also, spelled "d-o-l-l" and tried to make me\r\nunderstand that "d-o-l-l" applied to both. Earlier in the day we had had\r\na tussle over the words "m-u-g" and "w-a-t-e-r." Miss Sullivan had tried\r\nto impress it upon me that "m-u-g" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r" is water,\r\nbut I persisted in confounding the two. In despair she had dropped\r\nthe subject for the time, only to renew it at the first opportunity. I\r\nbecame impatient at her repeated attempts and, seizing the new doll,\r\nI dashed it upon the floor. I was keenly delighted when I felt the\r\nfragments of the broken doll at my feet. Neither sorrow nor regret\r\nfollowed my passionate outburst. I had not loved the doll. In the still,\r\ndark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment or tenderness.\r\nI felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of the hearth, and I\r\nhad a sense of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfort was\r\nremoved. She brought me my hat, and I knew I was going out into the warm\r\nsunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may be called a thought,\r\nmade me hop and skip with pleasure.\r\n\r\nWe walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the fragrance\r\nof the honeysuckle with which it was covered. Some one was drawing water\r\nand my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream gushed\r\nover one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly,\r\nthen rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the motions\r\nof her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something\r\nforgotten--a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery of\r\nlanguage was revealed to me. I knew then that "w-a-t-e-r" meant the\r\nwonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living\r\nword awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free! There were\r\nbarriers still, it is true, but barriers that could in time be swept\r\naway.\r\n\r\nI left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each\r\nname gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every\r\nobject which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because\r\nI saw everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me. On\r\nentering the door I remembered the doll I had broken. I felt my way\r\nto the hearth and picked up the pieces. I tried vainly to put them\r\ntogether. Then my eyes filled with tears; for I realized what I had\r\ndone, and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow.\r\n\r\nI learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they\r\nall were; but I do know that mother, father, sister, teacher were among\r\nthem--words that were to make the world blossom for me, "like Aaron\'s\r\nrod, with flowers." It would have been difficult to find a happier child\r\nthan I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful day and\r\nlived over the joys it had brought me, and for the first time longed for\r\na new day to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nI recall many incidents of the summer of 1887 that followed my soul\'s\r\nsudden awakening. I did nothing but explore with my hands and learn the\r\nname of every object that I touched; and the more I handled things and\r\nlearned their names and uses, the more joyous and confident grew my\r\nsense of kinship with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the time of daisies and buttercups came Miss Sullivan took me by\r\nthe hand across the fields, where men were preparing the earth for the\r\nseed, to the banks of the Tennessee River, and there, sitting on the\r\nwarm grass, I had my first lessons in the beneficence of nature. I\r\nlearned how the sun and the rain make to grow out of the ground every\r\ntree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, how birds build\r\ntheir nests and live and thrive from land to land, how the squirrel, the\r\ndeer, the lion and every other creature finds food and shelter. As my\r\nknowledge of things grew I felt more and more the delight of the world I\r\nwas in. Long before I learned to do a sum in arithmetic or describe the\r\nshape of the earth, Miss Sullivan had taught me to find beauty in the\r\nfragrant woods, in every blade of grass, and in the curves and dimples\r\nof my baby sister\'s hand. She linked my earliest thoughts with nature,\r\nand made me feel that "birds and flowers and I were happy peers."\r\n\r\nBut about this time I had an experience which taught me that nature is\r\nnot always kind. One day my teacher and I were returning from a long\r\nramble. The morning had been fine, but it was growing warm and sultry\r\nwhen at last we turned our faces homeward. Two or three times we stopped\r\nto rest under a tree by the wayside. Our last halt was under a wild\r\ncherry tree a short distance from the house. The shade was grateful, and\r\nthe tree was so easy to climb that with my teacher\'s assistance I was\r\nable to scramble to a seat in the branches. It was so cool up in the\r\ntree that Miss Sullivan proposed that we have our luncheon there. I\r\npromised to keep still while she went to the house to fetch it.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a change passed over the tree. All the sun\'s warmth left the\r\nair. I knew the sky was black, because all the heat, which meant light\r\nto me, had died out of the atmosphere. A strange odour came up from the\r\nearth. I knew it, it was the odour that always precedes a thunderstorm,\r\nand a nameless fear clutched at my heart. I felt absolutely alone,\r\ncut off from my friends and the firm earth. The immense, the unknown,\r\nenfolded me. I remained still and expectant; a chilling terror crept\r\nover me. I longed for my teacher\'s return; but above all things I wanted\r\nto get down from that tree.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of sinister silence, then a multitudinous stirring\r\nof the leaves. A shiver ran through the tree, and the wind sent forth a\r\nblast that would have knocked me off had I not clung to the branch with\r\nmight and main. The tree swayed and strained. The small twigs snapped\r\nand fell about me in showers. A wild impulse to jump seized me, but\r\nterror held me fast. I crouched down in the fork of the tree. The\r\nbranches lashed about me. I felt the intermittent jarring that came now\r\nand then, as if something heavy had fallen and the shock had traveled\r\nup till it reached the limb I sat on. It worked my suspense up to the\r\nhighest point, and just as I was thinking the tree and I should fall\r\ntogether, my teacher seized my hand and helped me down. I clung to her,\r\ntrembling with joy to feel the earth under my feet once more. I had\r\nlearned a new lesson--that nature "wages open war against her children,\r\nand under softest touch hides treacherous claws."\r\n\r\nAfter this experience it was a long time before I climbed another tree.\r\nThe mere thought filled me with terror. It was the sweet allurement\r\nof the mimosa tree in full bloom that finally overcame my fears. One\r\nbeautiful spring morning when I was alone in the summer-house, reading,\r\nI became aware of a wonderful subtle fragrance in the air. I started up\r\nand instinctively stretched out my hands. It seemed as if the spirit of\r\nspring had passed through the summer-house. "What is it?" I asked, and\r\nthe next minute I recognized the odour of the mimosa blossoms. I felt my\r\nway to the end of the garden, knowing that the mimosa tree was near the\r\nfence, at the turn of the path. Yes, there it was, all quivering in\r\nthe warm sunshine, its blossom-laden branches almost touching the long\r\ngrass. Was there ever anything so exquisitely beautiful in the world\r\nbefore! Its delicate blossoms shrank from the slightest earthly touch;\r\nit seemed as if a tree of paradise had been transplanted to earth. I\r\nmade my way through a shower of petals to the great trunk and for\r\none minute stood irresolute; then, putting my foot in the broad space\r\nbetween the forked branches, I pulled myself up into the tree. I had\r\nsome difficulty in holding on, for the branches were very large and\r\nthe bark hurt my hands. But I had a delicious sense that I was doing\r\nsomething unusual and wonderful so I kept on climbing higher and higher,\r\nuntil I reached a little seat which somebody had built there so long ago\r\nthat it had grown part of the tree itself. I sat there for a long, long\r\ntime, feeling like a fairy on a rosy cloud. After that I spent many\r\nhappy hours in my tree of paradise, thinking fair thoughts and dreaming\r\nbright dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nI had now the key to all language, and I was eager to learn to use it.\r\nChildren who hear acquire language without any particular effort; the\r\nwords that fall from others\' lips they catch on the wing, as it were,\r\ndelightedly, while the little deaf child must trap them by a slow\r\nand often painful process. But whatever the process, the result is\r\nwonderful. Gradually from naming an object we advance step by step until\r\nwe have traversed the vast distance between our first stammered syllable\r\nand the sweep of thought in a line of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nAt first, when my teacher told me about a new thing I asked very few\r\nquestions. My ideas were vague, and my vocabulary was inadequate; but as\r\nmy knowledge of things grew, and I learned more and more words, my field\r\nof inquiry broadened, and I would return again and again to the same\r\nsubject, eager for further information. Sometimes a new word revived an\r\nimage that some earlier experience had engraved on my brain.\r\n\r\nI remember the morning that I first asked the meaning of the word,\r\n"love." This was before I knew many words. I had found a few early\r\nviolets in the garden and brought them to my teacher. She tried to kiss\r\nme: but at that time I did not like to have any one kiss me except my\r\nmother. Miss Sullivan put her arm gently round me and spelled into my\r\nhand, "I love Helen."\r\n\r\n"What is love?" I asked.\r\n\r\nShe drew me closer to her and said, "It is here," pointing to my heart,\r\nwhose beats I was conscious of for the first time. Her words puzzled me\r\nvery much because I did not then understand anything unless I touched\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI smelt the violets in her hand and asked, half in words, half in signs,\r\na question which meant, "Is love the sweetness of flowers?"\r\n\r\n"No," said my teacher.\r\n\r\nAgain I thought. The warm sun was shining on us.\r\n\r\n"Is this not love?" I asked, pointing in the direction from which the\r\nheat came. "Is this not love?"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that there could be nothing more beautiful than the sun,\r\nwhose warmth makes all things grow. But Miss Sullivan shook her head,\r\nand I was greatly puzzled and disappointed. I thought it strange that my\r\nteacher could not show me love.\r\n\r\nA day or two afterward I was stringing beads of different sizes in\r\nsymmetrical groups--two large beads, three small ones, and so on. I had\r\nmade many mistakes, and Miss Sullivan had pointed them out again and\r\nagain with gentle patience. Finally I noticed a very obvious error\r\nin the sequence and for an instant I concentrated my attention on the\r\nlesson and tried to think how I should have arranged the beads. Miss\r\nSullivan touched my forehead and spelled with decided emphasis, "Think."\r\n\r\nIn a flash I knew that the word was the name of the process that was\r\ngoing on in my head. This was my first conscious perception of an\r\nabstract idea.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I was still--I was not thinking of the beads in my lap,\r\nbut trying to find a meaning for "love" in the light of this new\r\nidea. The sun had been under a cloud all day, and there had been brief\r\nshowers; but suddenly the sun broke forth in all its southern splendour.\r\n\r\nAgain I asked my teacher, "Is this not love?"\r\n\r\n"Love is something like the clouds that were in the sky before the sun\r\ncame out," she replied. Then in simpler words than these, which at that\r\ntime I could not have understood, she explained: "You cannot touch the\r\nclouds, you know; but you feel the rain and know how glad the flowers\r\nand the thirsty earth are to have it after a hot day. You cannot touch\r\nlove either; but you feel the sweetness that it pours into everything.\r\nWithout love you would not be happy or want to play."\r\n\r\nThe beautiful truth burst upon my mind--I felt that there were invisible\r\nlines stretched between my spirit and the spirits of others.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of my education Miss Sullivan made it a practice to\r\nspeak to me as she would speak to any hearing child; the only difference\r\nwas that she spelled the sentences into my hand instead of speaking\r\nthem. If I did not know the words and idioms necessary to express my\r\nthoughts she supplied them, even suggesting conversation when I was\r\nunable to keep up my end of the dialogue.\r\n\r\nThis process was continued for several years; for the deaf child does\r\nnot learn in a month, or even in two or three years, the numberless\r\nidioms and expressions used in the simplest daily intercourse.\r\nThe little hearing child learns these from constant repetition and\r\nimitation. The conversation he hears in his home stimulates his mind and\r\nsuggests topics and calls forth the spontaneous expression of his own\r\nthoughts. This natural exchange of ideas is denied to the deaf child.\r\nMy teacher, realizing this, determined to supply the kinds of stimulus\r\nI lacked. This she did by repeating to me as far as possible, verbatim,\r\nwhat she heard, and by showing me how I could take part in the\r\nconversation. But it was a long time before I ventured to take the\r\ninitiative, and still longer before I could find something appropriate\r\nto say at the right time.\r\n\r\nThe deaf and the blind find it very difficult to acquire the amenities\r\nof conversation. How much more this difficulty must be augmented in the\r\ncase of those who are both deaf and blind! They cannot distinguish the\r\ntone of the voice or, without assistance, go up and down the gamut of\r\ntones that give significance to words; nor can they watch the expression\r\nof the speaker\'s face, and a look is often the very soul of what one\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe next important step in my education was learning to read.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could spell a few words my teacher gave me slips of\r\ncardboard on which were printed words in raised letters. I quickly\r\nlearned that each printed word stood for an object, an act, or a\r\nquality. I had a frame in which I could arrange the words in little\r\nsentences; but before I ever put sentences in the frame I used to make\r\nthem in objects. I found the slips of paper which represented, for\r\nexample, "doll," "is," "on," "bed" and placed each name on its object;\r\nthen I put my doll on the bed with the words is, on, bed arranged beside\r\nthe doll, thus making a sentence of the words, and at the same time\r\ncarrying out the idea of the sentence with the things themselves.\r\n\r\nOne day, Miss Sullivan tells me, I pinned the word girl on my pinafore\r\nand stood in the wardrobe. On the shelf I arranged the words, is, in,\r\nwardrobe. Nothing delighted me so much as this game. My teacher and I\r\nplayed it for hours at a time. Often everything in the room was arranged\r\nin object sentences.\r\n\r\nFrom the printed slip it was but a step to the printed book. I took my\r\n"Reader for Beginners" and hunted for the words I knew; when I found\r\nthem my joy was like that of a game of hide-and-seek. Thus I began to\r\nread. Of the time when I began to read connected stories I shall speak\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I had no regular lessons. Even when I studied most\r\nearnestly it seemed more like play than work. Everything Miss Sullivan\r\ntaught me she illustrated by a beautiful story or a poem. Whenever\r\nanything delighted or interested me she talked it over with me just\r\nas if she were a little girl herself. What many children think of with\r\ndread, as a painful plodding through grammar, hard sums and harder\r\ndefinitions, is to-day one of my most precious memories.\r\n\r\nI cannot explain the peculiar sympathy Miss Sullivan had with my\r\npleasures and desires. Perhaps it was the result of long association\r\nwith the blind. Added to this she had a wonderful faculty for\r\ndescription. She went quickly over uninteresting details, and\r\nnever nagged me with questions to see if I remembered the\r\nday-before-yesterday\'s lesson. She introduced dry technicalities of\r\nscience little by little, making every subject so real that I could not\r\nhelp remembering what she taught.\r\n\r\nWe read and studied out of doors, preferring the sunlit woods to the\r\nhouse. All my early lessons have in them the breath of the woods--the\r\nfine, resinous odour of pine needles, blended with the perfume of wild\r\ngrapes. Seated in the gracious shade of a wild tulip tree, I learned to\r\nthink that everything has a lesson and a suggestion. "The loveliness of\r\nthings taught me all their use." Indeed, everything that could hum, or\r\nbuzz, or sing, or bloom had a part in my education-noisy-throated\r\nfrogs, katydids and crickets held in my hand until forgetting their\r\nembarrassment, they trilled their reedy note, little downy chickens\r\nand wildflowers, the dogwood blossoms, meadow-violets and budding fruit\r\ntrees. I felt the bursting cotton-bolls and fingered their soft fiber\r\nand fuzzy seeds; I felt the low soughing of the wind through the\r\ncornstalks, the silky rustling of the long leaves, and the indignant\r\nsnort of my pony, as we caught him in the pasture and put the bit in\r\nhis mouth--ah me! how well I remember the spicy, clovery smell of his\r\nbreath!\r\n\r\nSometimes I rose at dawn and stole into the garden while the heavy dew\r\nlay on the grass and flowers. Few know what joy it is to feel the roses\r\npressing softly into the hand, or the beautiful motion of the lilies\r\nas they sway in the morning breeze. Sometimes I caught an insect in the\r\nflower I was plucking, and I felt the faint noise of a pair of wings\r\nrubbed together in a sudden terror, as the little creature became aware\r\nof a pressure from without.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite haunt of mine was the orchard, where the fruit ripened\r\nearly in July. The large, downy peaches would reach themselves into my\r\nhand, and as the joyous breezes flew about the trees the apples tumbled\r\nat my feet. Oh, the delight with which I gathered up the fruit in my\r\npinafore, pressed my face against the smooth cheeks of the apples, still\r\nwarm from the sun, and skipped back to the house!\r\n\r\nOur favourite walk was to Keller\'s Landing, an old tumbledown\r\nlumber-wharf on the Tennessee River, used during the Civil War to\r\nland soldiers. There we spent many happy hours and played at learning\r\ngeography. I built dams of pebbles, made islands and lakes, and dug\r\nriver-beds, all for fun, and never dreamed that I was learning a lesson.\r\nI listened with increasing wonder to Miss Sullivan\'s descriptions of\r\nthe great round world with its burning mountains, buried cities, moving\r\nrivers of ice, and many other things as strange. She made raised maps in\r\nclay, so that I could feel the mountain ridges and valleys, and follow\r\nwith my fingers the devious course of rivers. I liked this, too; but the\r\ndivision of the earth into zones and poles confused and teased my mind.\r\nThe illustrative strings and the orange stick representing the poles\r\nseemed so real that even to this day the mere mention of temperate zone\r\nsuggests a series of twine circles; and I believe that if any one should\r\nset about it he could convince me that white bears actually climb the\r\nNorth Pole.\r\n\r\nArithmetic seems to have been the only study I did not like. From the\r\nfirst I was not interested in the science of numbers. Miss Sullivan\r\ntried to teach me to count by stringing beads in groups, and by\r\narranging kintergarten straws I learned to add and subtract. I never had\r\npatience to arrange more than five or six groups at a time. When I had\r\naccomplished this my conscience was at rest for the day, and I went out\r\nquickly to find my playmates.\r\n\r\nIn this same leisurely manner I studied zoology and botany.\r\n\r\nOnce a gentleman, whose name I have forgotten, sent me a collection of\r\nfossils--tiny mollusk shells beautifully marked, and bits of sandstone\r\nwith the print of birds\' claws, and a lovely fern in bas-relief. These\r\nwere the keys which unlocked the treasures of the antediluvian world for\r\nme. With trembling fingers I listened to Miss Sullivan\'s descriptions\r\nof the terrible beasts, with uncouth, unpronounceable names, which once\r\nwent tramping through the primeval forests, tearing down the branches\r\nof gigantic trees for food, and died in the dismal swamps of an unknown\r\nage. For a long time these strange creatures haunted my dreams, and this\r\ngloomy period formed a somber background to the joyous Now, filled with\r\nsunshine and roses and echoing with the gentle beat of my pony\'s hoof.\r\n\r\nAnother time a beautiful shell was given me, and with a child\'s surprise\r\nand delight I learned how a tiny mollusk had built the lustrous coil\r\nfor his dwelling place, and how on still nights, when there is no breeze\r\nstirring the waves, the Nautilus sails on the blue waters of the\r\nIndian Ocean in his "ship of pearl." After I had learned a great many\r\ninteresting things about the life and habits of the children of the\r\nsea--how in the midst of dashing waves the little polyps build the\r\nbeautiful coral isles of the Pacific, and the foraminifera have made the\r\nchalk-hills of many a land--my teacher read me "The Chambered Nautilus,"\r\nand showed me that the shell-building process of the mollusks is\r\nsymbolical of the development of the mind. Just as the wonder-working\r\nmantle of the Nautilus changes the material it absorbs from the water\r\nand makes it a part of itself, so the bits of knowledge one gathers\r\nundergo a similar change and become pearls of thought.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was the growth of a plant that furnished the text for a\r\nlesson. We bought a lily and set it in a sunny window. Very soon the\r\ngreen, pointed buds showed signs of opening. The slender, fingerlike\r\nleaves on the outside opened slowly, reluctant, I thought, to reveal\r\nthe loveliness they hid; once having made a start, however, the opening\r\nprocess went on rapidly, but in order and systematically. There was\r\nalways one bud larger and more beautiful than the rest, which pushed\r\nher outer, covering back with more pomp, as if the beauty in soft, silky\r\nrobes knew that she was the lily-queen by right divine, while her more\r\ntimid sisters doffed their green hoods shyly, until the whole plant was\r\none nodding bough of loveliness and fragrance.\r\n\r\nOnce there were eleven tadpoles in a glass globe set in a window full\r\nof plants. I remember the eagerness with which I made discoveries about\r\nthem. It was great fun to plunge my hand into the bowl and feel the\r\ntadpoles frisk about, and to let them slip and slide between my fingers.\r\nOne day a more ambitious fellow leaped beyond the edge of the bowl and\r\nfell on the floor, where I found him to all appearance more dead than\r\nalive. The only sign of life was a slight wriggling of his tail. But\r\nno sooner had he returned to his element than he darted to the bottom,\r\nswimming round and round in joyous activity. He had made his leap, he\r\nhad seen the great world, and was content to stay in his pretty glass\r\nhouse under the big fuchsia tree until he attained the dignity of\r\nfroghood. Then he went to live in the leafy pool at the end of the\r\ngarden, where he made the summer nights musical with his quaint\r\nlove-song.\r\n\r\nThus I learned from life itself. At the beginning I was only a little\r\nmass of possibilities. It was my teacher who unfolded and developed\r\nthem. When she came, everything about me breathed of love and joy and\r\nwas full of meaning. She has never since let pass an opportunity to\r\npoint out the beauty that is in everything, nor has she ceased trying in\r\nthought and action and example to make my life sweet and useful.\r\n\r\nIt was my teacher\'s genius, her quick sympathy, her loving tact which\r\nmade the first years of my education so beautiful. It was because she\r\nseized the right moment to impart knowledge that made it so pleasant\r\nand acceptable to me. She realized that a child\'s mind is like a shallow\r\nbrook which ripples and dances merrily over the stony course of its\r\neducation and reflects here a flower, there a bush, yonder a fleecy\r\ncloud; and she attempted to guide my mind on its way, knowing that like\r\na brook it should be fed by mountain streams and hidden springs, until\r\nit broadened out into a deep river, capable of reflecting in its placid\r\nsurface, billowy hills, the luminous shadows of trees and the blue\r\nheavens, as well as the sweet face of a little flower.\r\n\r\nAny teacher can take a child to the classroom, but not every teacher can\r\nmake him learn. He will not work joyously unless he feels that liberty\r\nis his, whether he is busy or at rest; he must feel the flush of victory\r\nand the heart-sinking of disappointment before he takes with a will the\r\ntasks distasteful to him and resolves to dance his way bravely through a\r\ndull routine of textbooks.\r\n\r\nMy teacher is so near to me that I scarcely think of myself apart from\r\nher. How much of my delight in all beautiful things is innate, and how\r\nmuch is due to her influence, I can never tell. I feel that her being is\r\ninseparable from my own, and that the footsteps of my life are in\r\nhers. All the best of me belongs to her--there is not a talent, or\r\nan aspiration or a joy in me that has not been awakened by her loving\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe first Christmas after Miss Sullivan came to Tuscumbia was a great\r\nevent. Every one in the family prepared surprises for me, but what\r\npleased me most, Miss Sullivan and I prepared surprises for everybody\r\nelse. The mystery that surrounded the gifts was my greatest delight and\r\namusement. My friends did all they could to excite my curiosity by hints\r\nand half-spelled sentences which they pretended to break off in the nick\r\nof time. Miss Sullivan and I kept up a game of guessing which taught\r\nme more about the use of language than any set lessons could have done.\r\nEvery evening, seated round a glowing wood fire, we played our guessing\r\ngame, which grew more and more exciting as Christmas approached.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve the Tuscumbia schoolchildren had their tree, to which\r\nthey invited me. In the centre of the schoolroom stood a beautiful\r\ntree ablaze and shimmering in the soft light, its branches loaded with\r\nstrange, wonderful fruit. It was a moment of supreme happiness. I danced\r\nand capered round the tree in an ecstasy. When I learned that there\r\nwas a gift for each child, I was delighted, and the kind people who had\r\nprepared the tree permitted me to hand the presents to the children. In\r\nthe pleasure of doing this, I did not stop to look at my own gifts; but\r\nwhen I was ready for them, my impatience for the real Christmas to begin\r\nalmost got beyond control. I knew the gifts I already had were not those\r\nof which friends had thrown out such tantalizing hints, and my teacher\r\nsaid the presents I was to have would be even nicer than these. I was\r\npersuaded, however, to content myself with the gifts from the tree and\r\nleave the others until morning.\r\n\r\nThat night, after I had hung my stocking, I lay awake a long time,\r\npretending to be asleep and keeping alert to see what Santa Claus would\r\ndo when he came. At last I fell asleep with a new doll and a white bear\r\nin my arms. Next morning it was I who waked the whole family with my\r\nfirst "Merry Christmas!" I found surprises, not in the stocking\r\nonly, but on the table, on all the chairs, at the door, on the very\r\nwindow-sill; indeed, I could hardly walk without stumbling on a bit of\r\nChristmas wrapped up in tissue paper. But when my teacher presented me\r\nwith a canary, my cup of happiness overflowed.\r\n\r\nLittle Tim was so tame that he would hop on my finger and eat candied\r\ncherries out of my hand. Miss Sullivan taught me to take all the care of\r\nmy new pet. Every morning after breakfast I prepared his bath, made his\r\ncage clean and sweet, filled his cups with fresh seed and water from the\r\nwell-house, and hung a spray of chickweed in his swing.\r\n\r\nOne morning I left the cage on the window-seat while I went to fetch\r\nwater for his bath. When I returned I felt a big cat brush past me as I\r\nopened the door. At first I did not realize what had happened; but when\r\nI put my hand in the cage and Tim\'s pretty wings did not meet my touch\r\nor his small pointed claws take hold of my finger, I knew that I should\r\nnever see my sweet little singer again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe next important event in my life was my visit to Boston, in May,\r\n1888. As if it were yesterday I remember the preparations, the departure\r\nwith my teacher and my mother, the journey, and finally the arrival\r\nin Boston. How different this journey was from the one I had made to\r\nBaltimore two years before! I was no longer a restless, excitable little\r\ncreature, requiring the attention of everybody on the train to keep\r\nme amused. I sat quietly beside Miss Sullivan, taking in with eager\r\ninterest all that she told me about what she saw out of the car window:\r\nthe beautiful Tennessee River, the great cotton-fields, the hills and\r\nwoods, and the crowds of laughing negroes at the stations, who waved to\r\nthe people on the train and brought delicious candy and popcorn balls\r\nthrough the car. On the seat opposite me sat my big rag doll, Nancy, in\r\na new gingham dress and a beruffled sunbonnet, looking at me out of\r\ntwo bead eyes. Sometimes, when I was not absorbed in Miss Sullivan\'s\r\ndescriptions, I remembered Nancy\'s existence and took her up in my arms,\r\nbut I generally calmed my conscience by making myself believe that she\r\nwas asleep.\r\n\r\nAs I shall not have occasion to refer to Nancy again, I wish to tell\r\nhere a sad experience she had soon after our arrival in Boston. She was\r\ncovered with dirt--the remains of mud pies I had compelled her to eat,\r\nalthough she had never shown any special liking for them. The laundress\r\nat the Perkins Institution secretly carried her off to give her a bath.\r\nThis was too much for poor Nancy. When I next saw her she was a formless\r\nheap of cotton, which I should not have recognized at all except for the\r\ntwo bead eyes which looked out at me reproachfully.\r\n\r\nWhen the train at last pulled into the station at Boston it was as if a\r\nbeautiful fairy tale had come true. The "once upon a time" was now; the\r\n"far-away country" was here.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely arrived at the Perkins Institution for the Blind when\r\nI began to make friends with the little blind children. It delighted me\r\ninexpressibly to find that they knew the manual alphabet. What joy to\r\ntalk with other children in my own language! Until then I had been like\r\na foreigner speaking through an interpreter. In the school where Laura\r\nBridgman was taught I was in my own country. It took me some time to\r\nappreciate the fact that my new friends were blind. I knew I could not\r\nsee; but it did not seem possible that all the eager, loving children\r\nwho gathered round me and joined heartily in my frolics were also blind.\r\nI remember the surprise and the pain I felt as I noticed that they\r\nplaced their hands over mine when I talked to them and that they read\r\nbooks with their fingers. Although I had been told this before, and\r\nalthough I understood my own deprivations, yet I had thought vaguely\r\nthat since they could hear, they must have a sort of "second sight,"\r\nand I was not prepared to find one child and another and yet another\r\ndeprived of the same precious gift. But they were so happy and contented\r\nthat I lost all sense of pain in the pleasure of their companionship.\r\n\r\nOne day spent with the blind children made me feel thoroughly at home in\r\nmy new environment, and I looked eagerly from one pleasant experience to\r\nanother as the days flew swiftly by. I could not quite convince myself\r\nthat there was much world left, for I regarded Boston as the beginning\r\nand the end of creation.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in Boston we visited Bunker Hill, and there I had my first\r\nlesson in history. The story of the brave men who had fought on the spot\r\nwhere we stood excited me greatly. I climbed the monument, counting the\r\nsteps, and wondering as I went higher and yet higher if the soldiers had\r\nclimbed this great stairway and shot at the enemy on the ground below.\r\n\r\nThe next day we went to Plymouth by water. This was my first trip on the\r\nocean and my first voyage in a steamboat. How full of life and motion\r\nit was! But the rumble of the machinery made me think it was thundering,\r\nand I began to cry, because I feared if it rained we should not be able\r\nto have our picnic out of doors. I was more interested, I think, in\r\nthe great rock on which the Pilgrims landed than in anything else in\r\nPlymouth. I could touch it, and perhaps that made the coming of the\r\nPilgrims and their toils and great deeds seem more real to me. I have\r\noften held in my hand a little model of the Plymouth Rock which a kind\r\ngentleman gave me at Pilgrim Hall, and I have fingered its curves, the\r\nsplit in the centre and the embossed figures "1620," and turned over in\r\nmy mind all that I knew about the wonderful story of the Pilgrims.\r\n\r\nHow my childish imagination glowed with the splendour of their\r\nenterprise! I idealized them as the bravest and most generous men that\r\never sought a home in a strange land. I thought they desired the freedom\r\nof their fellow men as well as their own. I was keenly surprised and\r\ndisappointed years later to learn of their acts of persecution that make\r\nus tingle with shame, even while we glory in the courage and energy that\r\ngave us our "Country Beautiful."\r\n\r\nAmong the many friends I made in Boston were Mr. William Endicott and\r\nhis daughter. Their kindness to me was the seed from which many pleasant\r\nmemories have since grown. One day we visited their beautiful home\r\nat Beverly Farms. I remember with delight how I went through their\r\nrose-garden, how their dogs, big Leo and little curly-haired Fritz with\r\nlong ears, came to meet me, and how Nimrod, the swiftest of the horses,\r\npoked his nose into my hands for a pat and a lump of sugar. I also\r\nremember the beach, where for the first time I played in the sand.\r\nIt was hard, smooth sand, very different from the loose, sharp sand,\r\nmingled with kelp and shells, at Brewster. Mr. Endicott told me about\r\nthe great ships that came sailing by from Boston, bound for Europe. I\r\nsaw him many times after that, and he was always a good friend to me;\r\nindeed, I was thinking of him when I called Boston "the City of Kind\r\nHearts."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nJust before the Perkins Institution closed for the summer, it was\r\narranged that my teacher and I should spend our vacation at Brewster,\r\non Cape Cod, with our dear friend, Mrs. Hopkins. I was delighted, for my\r\nmind was full of the prospective joys and of the wonderful stories I had\r\nheard about the sea.\r\n\r\nMy most vivid recollection of that summer is the ocean. I had always\r\nlived far inland and had never had so much as a whiff of salt air; but\r\nI had read in a big book called "Our World" a description of the ocean\r\nwhich filled me with wonder and an intense longing to touch the\r\nmighty sea and feel it roar. So my little heart leaped high with eager\r\nexcitement when I knew that my wish was at last to be realized.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I been helped into my bathing-suit than I sprang out upon\r\nthe warm sand and without thought of fear plunged into the cool water.\r\nI felt the great billows rock and sink. The buoyant motion of the water\r\nfilled me with an exquisite, quivering joy. Suddenly my ecstasy gave\r\nplace to terror; for my foot struck against a rock and the next instant\r\nthere was a rush of water over my head. I thrust out my hands to grasp\r\nsome support, I clutched at the water and at the seaweed which the waves\r\ntossed in my face. But all my frantic efforts were in vain. The waves\r\nseemed to be playing a game with me, and tossed me from one to another\r\nin their wild frolic. It was fearful! The good, firm earth had slipped\r\nfrom my feet, and everything seemed shut out from this strange,\r\nall-enveloping element--life, air, warmth and love. At last, however,\r\nthe sea, as if weary of its new toy, threw me back on the shore, and in\r\nanother instant I was clasped in my teacher\'s arms. Oh, the comfort\r\nof the long, tender embrace! As soon as I had recovered from my panic\r\nsufficiently to say anything, I demanded: "Who put salt in the water?"\r\n\r\nAfter I had recovered from my first experience in the water, I thought\r\nit great fun to sit on a big rock in my bathing-suit and feel wave after\r\nwave dash against the rock, sending up a shower of spray which quite\r\ncovered me. I felt the pebbles rattling as the waves threw their\r\nponderous weight against the shore; the whole beach seemed racked by\r\ntheir terrific onset, and the air throbbed with their pulsations. The\r\nbreakers would swoop back to gather themselves for a mightier leap, and\r\nI clung to the rock, tense, fascinated, as I felt the dash and roar of\r\nthe rushing sea!\r\n\r\nI could never stay long enough on the shore. The tang of the untainted,\r\nfresh and free sea air was like a cool, quieting thought, and the shells\r\nand pebbles and the seaweed with tiny living creatures attached to it\r\nnever lost their fascination for me. One day Miss Sullivan attracted\r\nmy attention to a strange object which she had captured basking in the\r\nshallow water. It was a great horseshoe crab--the first one I had ever\r\nseen. I felt of him and thought it very strange that he should carry\r\nhis house on his back. It suddenly occurred to me that he might make a\r\ndelightful pet; so I seized him by the tail with both hands and carried\r\nhim home. This feat pleased me highly, as his body was very heavy, and\r\nit took all my strength to drag him half a mile. I would not leave Miss\r\nSullivan in peace until she had put the crab in a trough near the well\r\nwhere I was confident he would be secure. But next morning I went to the\r\ntrough, and lo, he had disappeared! Nobody knew where he had gone, or\r\nhow he had escaped. My disappointment was bitter at the time; but little\r\nby little I came to realize that it was not kind or wise to force this\r\npoor dumb creature out of his element, and after awhile I felt happy in\r\nthe thought that perhaps he had returned to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nIn the autumn I returned to my Southern home with a heart full of joyous\r\nmemories. As I recall that visit North I am filled with wonder at the\r\nrichness and variety of the experiences that cluster about it. It\r\nseems to have been the beginning of everything. The treasures of a\r\nnew, beautiful world were laid at my feet, and I took in pleasure and\r\ninformation at every turn. I lived myself into all things. I was never\r\nstill a moment; my life was as full of motion as those little insects\r\nthat crowd a whole existence into one brief day. I met many people who\r\ntalked with me by spelling into my hand, and thought in joyous sympathy\r\nleaped up to meet thought, and behold, a miracle had been wrought! The\r\nbarren places between my mind and the minds of others blossomed like the\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nI spent the autumn months with my family at our summer cottage, on a\r\nmountain about fourteen miles from Tuscumbia. It was called Fern Quarry,\r\nbecause near it there was a limestone quarry, long since abandoned.\r\nThree frolicsome little streams ran through it from springs in the rocks\r\nabove, leaping here and tumbling there in laughing cascades wherever the\r\nrocks tried to bar their way. The opening was filled with ferns which\r\ncompletely covered the beds of limestone and in places hid the streams.\r\nThe rest of the mountain was thickly wooded. Here were great oaks and\r\nsplendid evergreens with trunks like mossy pillars, from the branches of\r\nwhich hung garlands of ivy and mistletoe, and persimmon trees, the\r\nodour of which pervaded every nook and corner of the wood--an illusive,\r\nfragrant something that made the heart glad. In places the wild\r\nmuscadine and scuppernong vines stretched from tree to tree, making\r\narbours which were always full of butterflies and buzzing insects. It\r\nwas delightful to lose ourselves in the green hollows of that tangled\r\nwood in the late afternoon, and to smell the cool, delicious odours that\r\ncame up from the earth at the close of day.\r\n\r\nOur cottage was a sort of rough camp, beautifully situated on the top of\r\nthe mountain among oaks and pines. The small rooms were arranged on each\r\nside of a long open hall. Round the house was a wide piazza, where the\r\nmountain winds blew, sweet with all wood-scents. We lived on the piazza\r\nmost of the time--there we worked, ate and played. At the back door\r\nthere was a great butternut tree, round which the steps had been built,\r\nand in front the trees stood so close that I could touch them and feel\r\nthe wind shake their branches, or the leaves twirl downward in the\r\nautumn blast.\r\n\r\nMany visitors came to Fern Quarry. In the evening, by the campfire, the\r\nmen played cards and whiled away the hours in talk and sport. They told\r\nstories of their wonderful feats with fowl, fish and quadruped--how\r\nmany wild ducks and turkeys they had shot, what "savage trout" they had\r\ncaught, and how they had bagged the craftiest foxes, outwitted the most\r\nclever \'possums and overtaken the fleetest deer, until I thought that\r\nsurely the lion, the tiger, the bear and the rest of the wild tribe\r\nwould not be able to stand before these wily hunters. "To-morrow to the\r\nchase!" was their good-night shout as the circle of merry friends broke\r\nup for the night. The men slept in the hall outside our door, and I\r\ncould feel the deep breathing of the dogs and the hunters as they lay on\r\ntheir improvised beds.\r\n\r\nAt dawn I was awakened by the smell of coffee, the rattling of guns,\r\nand the heavy footsteps of the men as they strode about, promising\r\nthemselves the greatest luck of the season. I could also feel the\r\nstamping of the horses, which they had ridden out from town and hitched\r\nunder the trees, where they stood all night, neighing loudly, impatient\r\nto be off. At last the men mounted, and, as they say in the old songs,\r\naway went the steeds with bridles ringing and whips cracking and hounds\r\nracing ahead, and away went the champion hunters "with hark and whoop\r\nand wild halloo!"\r\n\r\nLater in the morning we made preparations for a barbecue. A fire was\r\nkindled at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground, big sticks were laid\r\ncrosswise at the top, and meat was hung from them and turned on spits.\r\nAround the fire squatted negroes, driving away the flies with long\r\nbranches. The savoury odour of the meat made me hungry long before the\r\ntables were set.\r\n\r\nWhen the bustle and excitement of preparation was at its height, the\r\nhunting party made its appearance, struggling in by twos and threes, the\r\nmen hot and weary, the horses covered with foam, and the jaded hounds\r\npanting and dejected--and not a single kill! Every man declared that he\r\nhad seen at least one deer, and that the animal had come very close;\r\nbut however hotly the dogs might pursue the game, however well the\r\nguns might be aimed, at the snap of the trigger there was not a deer\r\nin sight. They had been as fortunate as the little boy who said he came\r\nvery near seeing a rabbit--he saw his tracks. The party soon forgot its\r\ndisappointment, however, and we sat down, not to venison, but to a tamer\r\nfeast of veal and roast pig.\r\n\r\nOne summer I had my pony at Fern Quarry. I called him Black Beauty, as I\r\nhad just read the book, and he resembled his namesake in every way, from\r\nhis glossy black coat to the white star on his forehead. I spent many of\r\nmy happiest hours on his back. Occasionally, when it was quite safe,\r\nmy teacher would let go the leading-rein, and the pony sauntered on or\r\nstopped at his sweet will to eat grass or nibble the leaves of the trees\r\nthat grew beside the narrow trail.\r\n\r\nOn mornings when I did not care for the ride, my teacher and I would\r\nstart after breakfast for a ramble in the woods, and allow ourselves\r\nto get lost amid the trees and vines, with no road to follow except\r\nthe paths made by cows and horses. Frequently we came upon impassable\r\nthickets which forced us to take a round about way. We always returned\r\nto the cottage with armfuls of laurel, goldenrod, ferns and gorgeous\r\nswamp-flowers such as grow only in the South.\r\n\r\nSometimes I would go with Mildred and my little cousins to gather\r\npersimmons. I did not eat them; but I loved their fragrance and enjoyed\r\nhunting for them in the leaves and grass. We also went nutting, and I\r\nhelped them open the chestnut burrs and break the shells of hickory-nuts\r\nand walnuts--the big, sweet walnuts!\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the mountain there was a railroad, and the children\r\nwatched the trains whiz by. Sometimes a terrific whistle brought us to\r\nthe steps, and Mildred told me in great excitement that a cow or a\r\nhorse had strayed on the track. About a mile distant there was a trestle\r\nspanning a deep gorge. It was very difficult to walk over, the ties were\r\nwide apart and so narrow that one felt as if one were walking on knives.\r\nI had never crossed it until one day Mildred, Miss Sullivan and I were\r\nlost in the woods, and wandered for hours without finding a path.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mildred pointed with her little hand and exclaimed, "There\'s\r\nthe trestle!" We would have taken any way rather than this; but it was\r\nlate and growing dark, and the trestle was a short cut home. I had to\r\nfeel for the rails with my toe; but I was not afraid, and got on\r\nvery well, until all at once there came a faint "puff, puff" from the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n"I see the train!" cried Mildred, and in another minute it would have\r\nbeen upon us had we not climbed down on the crossbraces while it rushed\r\nover our heads. I felt the hot breath from the engine on my face, and\r\nthe smoke and ashes almost choked us. As the train rumbled by, the\r\ntrestle shook and swayed until I thought we should be dashed to the\r\nchasm below. With the utmost difficulty we regained the track. Long\r\nafter dark we reached home and found the cottage empty; the family were\r\nall out hunting for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAfter my first visit to Boston, I spent almost every winter in the\r\nNorth. Once I went on a visit to a New England village with its frozen\r\nlakes and vast snow fields. It was then that I had opportunities such as\r\nhad never been mine to enter into the treasures of the snow.\r\n\r\nI recall my surprise on discovering that a mysterious hand had stripped\r\nthe trees and bushes, leaving only here and there a wrinkled leaf. The\r\nbirds had flown, and their empty nests in the bare trees were filled\r\nwith snow. Winter was on hill and field. The earth seemed benumbed by\r\nhis icy touch, and the very spirits of the trees had withdrawn to their\r\nroots, and there, curled up in the dark, lay fast asleep. All life\r\nseemed to have ebbed away, and even when the sun shone the day was\r\n\r\n     Shrunk and cold,\r\n     As if her veins were sapless and old,\r\n     And she rose up decrepitly\r\n     For a last dim look at earth and sea.\r\n\r\nThe withered grass and the bushes were transformed into a forest of\r\nicicles.\r\n\r\nThen came a day when the chill air portended a snowstorm. We rushed\r\nout-of-doors to feel the first few tiny flakes descending. Hour by hour\r\nthe flakes dropped silently, softly from their airy height to the earth,\r\nand the country became more and more level. A snowy night closed upon\r\nthe world, and in the morning one could scarcely recognize a feature\r\nof the landscape. All the roads were hidden, not a single landmark was\r\nvisible, only a waste of snow with trees rising out of it.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a wind from the northeast sprang up, and the flakes\r\nrushed hither and thither in furious melee. Around the great fire we sat\r\nand told merry tales, and frolicked, and quite forgot that we were in\r\nthe midst of a desolate solitude, shut in from all communication with\r\nthe outside world. But during the night the fury of the wind increased\r\nto such a degree that it thrilled us with a vague terror. The rafters\r\ncreaked and strained, and the branches of the trees surrounding the\r\nhouse rattled and beat against the windows, as the winds rioted up and\r\ndown the country.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after the beginning of the storm the snow ceased. The\r\nsun broke through the clouds and shone upon a vast, undulating\r\nwhite plain. High mounds, pyramids heaped in fantastic shapes, and\r\nimpenetrable drifts lay scattered in every direction.\r\n\r\nNarrow paths were shoveled through the drifts. I put on my cloak and\r\nhood and went out. The air stung my cheeks like fire. Half walking in\r\nthe paths, half working our way through the lesser drifts, we succeeded\r\nin reaching a pine grove just outside a broad pasture. The trees stood\r\nmotionless and white like figures in a marble frieze. There was no odour\r\nof pine-needles. The rays of the sun fell upon the trees, so that the\r\ntwigs sparkled like diamonds and dropped in showers when we touched\r\nthem. So dazzling was the light, it penetrated even the darkness that\r\nveils my eyes.\r\n\r\nAs the days wore on, the drifts gradually shrunk, but before they were\r\nwholly gone another storm came, so that I scarcely felt the earth under\r\nmy feet once all winter. At intervals the trees lost their icy covering,\r\nand the bulrushes and underbrush were bare; but the lake lay frozen and\r\nhard beneath the sun.\r\n\r\nOur favourite amusement during that winter was tobogganing. In places\r\nthe shore of the lake rises abruptly from the water\'s edge. Down these\r\nsteep slopes we used to coast. We would get on our toboggan, a boy\r\nwould give us a shove, and off we went! Plunging through drifts, leaping\r\nhollows, swooping down upon the lake, we would shoot across its gleaming\r\nsurface to the opposite bank. What joy! What exhilarating madness! For\r\none wild, glad moment we snapped the chain that binds us to earth, and\r\njoining hands with the winds we felt ourselves divine!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1890 that I learned to speak. The impulse to\r\nutter audible sounds had always been strong within me. I used to make\r\nnoises, keeping one hand on my throat while the other hand felt the\r\nmovements of my lips. I was pleased with anything that made a noise and\r\nliked to feel the cat purr and the dog bark. I also liked to keep my\r\nhand on a singer\'s throat, or on a piano when it was being played.\r\nBefore I lost my sight and hearing, I was fast learning to talk, but\r\nafter my illness it was found that I had ceased to speak because I could\r\nnot hear. I used to sit in my mother\'s lap all day long and keep my\r\nhands on her face because it amused me to feel the motions of her lips;\r\nand I moved my lips, too, although I had forgotten what talking was. My\r\nfriends say that I laughed and cried naturally, and for awhile I\r\nmade many sounds and word-elements, not because they were a means of\r\ncommunication, but because the need of exercising my vocal organs was\r\nimperative. There was, however, one word the meaning of which I still\r\nremembered, WATER. I pronounced it "wa-wa." Even this became less and\r\nless intelligible until the time when Miss Sullivan began to teach me.\r\nI stopped using it only after I had learned to spell the word on my\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nI had known for a long time that the people about me used a method of\r\ncommunication different from mine; and even before I knew that a deaf\r\nchild could be taught to speak, I was conscious of dissatisfaction with\r\nthe means of communication I already possessed. One who is entirely\r\ndependent upon the manual alphabet has always a sense of restraint,\r\nof narrowness. This feeling began to agitate me with a vexing,\r\nforward-reaching sense of a lack that should be filled. My thoughts\r\nwould often rise and beat up like birds against the wind, and I\r\npersisted in using my lips and voice. Friends tried to discourage this\r\ntendency, fearing lest it would lead to disappointment. But I persisted,\r\nand an accident soon occurred which resulted in the breaking down of\r\nthis great barrier--I heard the story of Ragnhild Kaata.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mrs. Lamson, who had been one of Laura Bridgman\'s teachers, and\r\nwho had just returned from a visit to Norway and Sweden, came to see me,\r\nand told me of Ragnhild Kaata, a deaf and blind girl in Norway who had\r\nactually been taught to speak. Mrs. Lamson had scarcely finished telling\r\nme about this girl\'s success before I was on fire with eagerness. I\r\nresolved that I, too, would learn to speak. I would not rest satisfied\r\nuntil my teacher took me, for advice and assistance, to Miss Sarah\r\nFuller, principal of the Horace Mann School. This lovely, sweet-natured\r\nlady offered to teach me herself, and we began the twenty-sixth of\r\nMarch, 1890.\r\n\r\nMiss Fuller\'s method was this: she passed my hand lightly over her face,\r\nand let me feel the position of her tongue and lips when she made a\r\nsound. I was eager to imitate every motion and in an hour had learned\r\nsix elements of speech: M, P, A, S, T, I. Miss Fuller gave me eleven\r\nlessons in all. I shall never forget the surprise and delight I felt\r\nwhen I uttered my first connected sentence, "It is warm." True, they\r\nwere broken and stammering syllables; but they were human speech. My\r\nsoul, conscious of new strength, came out of bondage, and was reaching\r\nthrough those broken symbols of speech to all knowledge and all faith.\r\n\r\nNo deaf child who has earnestly tried to speak the words which he has\r\nnever heard--to come out of the prison of silence, where no tone\r\nof love, no song of bird, no strain of music ever pierces the\r\nstillness--can forget the thrill of surprise, the joy of discovery\r\nwhich came over him when he uttered his first word. Only such a one\r\ncan appreciate the eagerness with which I talked to my toys, to stones,\r\ntrees, birds and dumb animals, or the delight I felt when at my call\r\nMildred ran to me or my dogs obeyed my commands. It is an unspeakable\r\nboon to me to be able to speak in winged words that need no\r\ninterpretation. As I talked, happy thoughts fluttered up out of my words\r\nthat might perhaps have struggled in vain to escape my fingers.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that I could really talk in this short time.\r\nI had learned only the elements of speech. Miss Fuller and Miss Sullivan\r\ncould understand me, but most people would not have understood one word\r\nin a hundred. Nor is it true that, after I had learned these elements,\r\nI did the rest of the work myself. But for Miss Sullivan\'s genius,\r\nuntiring perseverance and devotion, I could not have progressed as far\r\nas I have toward natural speech. In the first place, I laboured night\r\nand day before I could be understood even by my most intimate friends;\r\nin the second place, I needed Miss Sullivan\'s assistance constantly in\r\nmy efforts to articulate each sound clearly and to combine all sounds\r\nin a thousand ways. Even now she calls my attention every day to\r\nmispronounced words.\r\n\r\nAll teachers of the deaf know what this means, and only they can at all\r\nappreciate the peculiar difficulties with which I had to contend. In\r\nreading my teacher\'s lips I was wholly dependent on my fingers: I had\r\nto use the sense of touch in catching the vibrations of the throat, the\r\nmovements of the mouth and the expression of the face; and often this\r\nsense was at fault. In such cases I was forced to repeat the words or\r\nsentences, sometimes for hours, until I felt the proper ring in my own\r\nvoice. My work was practice, practice, practice. Discouragement and\r\nweariness cast me down frequently; but the next moment the thought that\r\nI should soon be at home and show my loved ones what I had accomplished,\r\nspurred me on, and I eagerly looked forward to their pleasure in my\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n"My little sister will understand me now," was a thought stronger than\r\nall obstacles. I used to repeat ecstatically, "I am not dumb now." I\r\ncould not be despondent while I anticipated the delight of talking to my\r\nmother and reading her responses from her lips. It astonished me to\r\nfind how much easier it is to talk than to spell with the fingers, and\r\nI discarded the manual alphabet as a medium of communication on my part;\r\nbut Miss Sullivan and a few friends still use it in speaking to me, for\r\nit is more convenient and more rapid than lip-reading.\r\n\r\nJust here, perhaps, I had better explain our use of the manual alphabet,\r\nwhich seems to puzzle people who do not know us. One who reads or\r\ntalks to me spells with his hand, using the single-hand manual alphabet\r\ngenerally employed by the deaf. I place my hand on the hand of the\r\nspeaker so lightly as not to impede its movements. The position of the\r\nhand is as easy to feel as it is to see. I do not feel each letter\r\nany more than you see each letter separately when you read. Constant\r\npractice makes the fingers very flexible, and some of my friends spell\r\nrapidly--about as fast as an expert writes on a typewriter. The mere\r\nspelling is, of course, no more a conscious act than it is in writing.\r\n\r\nWhen I had made speech my own, I could not wait to go home. At last\r\nthe happiest of happy moments arrived. I had made my homeward journey,\r\ntalking constantly to Miss Sullivan, not for the sake of talking, but\r\ndetermined to improve to the last minute. Almost before I knew it, the\r\ntrain stopped at the Tuscumbia station, and there on the platform stood\r\nthe whole family. My eyes fill with tears now as I think how my mother\r\npressed me close to her, speechless and trembling with delight, taking\r\nin every syllable that I spoke, while little Mildred seized my free\r\nhand and kissed it and danced, and my father expressed his pride and\r\naffection in a big silence. It was as if Isaiah\'s prophecy had been\r\nfulfilled in me, "The mountains and the hills shall break forth before\r\nyou into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their\r\nhands!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1892 was darkened by the one cloud in my childhood\'s\r\nbright sky. Joy deserted my heart, and for a long, long time I lived in\r\ndoubt, anxiety and fear. Books lost their charm for me, and even now the\r\nthought of those dreadful days chills my heart. A little story called\r\n"The Frost King," which I wrote and sent to Mr. Anagnos, of the Perkins\r\nInstitution for the Blind, was at the root of the trouble. In order to\r\nmake the matter clear, I must set forth the facts connected with this\r\nepisode, which justice to my teacher and to myself compels me to relate.\r\n\r\nI wrote the story when I was at home, the autumn after I had learned to\r\nspeak. We had stayed up at Fern Quarry later than usual. While we\r\nwere there, Miss Sullivan had described to me the beauties of the late\r\nfoliage, and it seems that her descriptions revived the memory of\r\na story, which must have been read to me, and which I must have\r\nunconsciously retained. I thought then that I was "making up a story,"\r\nas children say, and I eagerly sat down to write it before the ideas\r\nshould slip from me. My thoughts flowed easily; I felt a sense of joy in\r\nthe composition. Words and images came tripping to my finger ends, and\r\nas I thought out sentence after sentence, I wrote them on my braille\r\nslate. Now, if words and images come to me without effort, it is a\r\npretty sure sign that they are not the offspring of my own mind, but\r\nstray waifs that I regretfully dismiss. At that time I eagerly absorbed\r\neverything I read without a thought of authorship, and even now I cannot\r\nbe quite sure of the boundary line between my ideas and those I find in\r\nbooks. I suppose that is because so many of my impressions come to me\r\nthrough the medium of others\' eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nWhen the story was finished, I read it to my teacher, and I recall\r\nnow vividly the pleasure I felt in the more beautiful passages, and\r\nmy annoyance at being interrupted to have the pronunciation of a word\r\ncorrected. At dinner it was read to the assembled family, who were\r\nsurprised that I could write so well. Some one asked me if I had read it\r\nin a book.\r\n\r\nThis question surprised me very much; for I had not the faintest\r\nrecollection of having had it read to me. I spoke up and said, "Oh, no,\r\nit is my story, and I have written it for Mr. Anagnos."\r\n\r\nAccordingly I copied the story and sent it to him for his birthday. It\r\nwas suggested that I should change the title from "Autumn Leaves"\r\nto "The Frost King," which I did. I carried the little story to the\r\npost-office myself, feeling as if I were walking on air. I little\r\ndreamed how cruelly I should pay for that birthday gift.\r\n\r\nMr. Anagnos was delighted with "The Frost King," and published it in\r\none of the Perkins Institution reports. This was the pinnacle of my\r\nhappiness, from which I was in a little while dashed to earth. I had\r\nbeen in Boston only a short time when it was discovered that a story\r\nsimilar to "The Frost King," called "The Frost Fairies" by Miss Margaret\r\nT. Canby, had appeared before I was born in a book called "Birdie and\r\nHis Friends." The two stories were so much alike in thought and language\r\nthat it was evident Miss Canby\'s story had been read to me, and that\r\nmine was--a plagiarism. It was difficult to make me understand this; but\r\nwhen I did understand I was astonished and grieved. No child ever drank\r\ndeeper of the cup of bitterness than I did. I had disgraced myself;\r\nI had brought suspicion upon those I loved best. And yet how could it\r\npossibly have happened? I racked my brain until I was weary to recall\r\nanything about the frost that I had read before I wrote "The Frost\r\nKing"; but I could remember nothing, except the common reference to Jack\r\nFrost, and a poem for children, "The Freaks of the Frost," and I knew I\r\nhad not used that in my composition.\r\n\r\nAt first Mr. Anagnos, though deeply troubled, seemed to believe me. He\r\nwas unusually tender and kind to me, and for a brief space the shadow\r\nlifted. To please him I tried not to be unhappy, and to make myself as\r\npretty as possible for the celebration of Washington\'s birthday, which\r\ntook place very soon after I received the sad news.\r\n\r\nI was to be Ceres in a kind of masque given by the blind girls. How well\r\nI remember the graceful draperies that enfolded me, the bright autumn\r\nleaves that wreathed my head, and the fruit and grain at my feet and in\r\nmy hands, and beneath all the piety of the masque the oppressive sense\r\nof coming ill that made my heart heavy.\r\n\r\nThe night before the celebration, one of the teachers of the Institution\r\nhad asked me a question connected with "The Frost King," and I was\r\ntelling her that Miss Sullivan had talked to me about Jack Frost and\r\nhis wonderful works. Something I said made her think she detected in my\r\nwords a confession that I did remember Miss Canby\'s story of "The Frost\r\nFairies," and she laid her conclusions before Mr. Anagnos, although I\r\nhad told her most emphatically that she was mistaken.\r\n\r\nMr. Anagnos, who loved me tenderly, thinking that he had been deceived,\r\nturned a deaf ear to the pleadings of love and innocence. He believed,\r\nor at least suspected, that Miss Sullivan and I had deliberately stolen\r\nthe bright thoughts of another and imposed them on him to win his\r\nadmiration. I was brought before a court of investigation composed of\r\nthe teachers and officers of the Institution, and Miss Sullivan was\r\nasked to leave me. Then I was questioned and cross-questioned with what\r\nseemed to me a determination on the part of my judges to force me to\r\nacknowledge that I remembered having had "The Frost Fairies" read to\r\nme. I felt in every question the doubt and suspicion that was in\r\ntheir minds, and I felt, too, that a loved friend was looking at me\r\nreproachfully, although I could not have put all this into words. The\r\nblood pressed about my thumping heart, and I could scarcely speak,\r\nexcept in monosyllables. Even the consciousness that it was only a\r\ndreadful mistake did not lessen my suffering, and when at last I was\r\nallowed to leave the room, I was dazed and did not notice my teacher\'s\r\ncaresses, or the tender words of my friends, who said I was a brave\r\nlittle girl and they were proud of me.\r\n\r\nAs I lay in my bed that night, I wept as I hope few children have wept.\r\nI felt so cold, I imagined I should die before morning, and the thought\r\ncomforted me. I think if this sorrow had come to me when I was older,\r\nit would have broken my spirit beyond repairing. But the angel of\r\nforgetfulness has gathered up and carried away much of the misery and\r\nall the bitterness of those sad days.\r\n\r\nMiss Sullivan had never heard of "The Frost Fairies" or of the book\r\nin which it was published. With the assistance of Dr. Alexander Graham\r\nBell, she investigated the matter carefully, and at last it came out\r\nthat Mrs. Sophia C. Hopkins had a copy of Miss Canby\'s "Birdie and\r\nHis Friends" in 1888, the year that we spent the summer with her at\r\nBrewster. Mrs. Hopkins was unable to find her copy; but she has told me\r\nthat at that time, while Miss Sullivan was away on a vacation, she tried\r\nto amuse me by reading from various books, and although she could not\r\nremember reading "The Frost Fairies" any more than I, yet she felt\r\nsure that "Birdie and His Friends" was one of them. She explained the\r\ndisappearance of the book by the fact that she had a short time\r\nbefore sold her house and disposed of many juvenile books, such as\r\nold schoolbooks and fairy tales, and that "Birdie and His Friends" was\r\nprobably among them.\r\n\r\nThe stories had little or no meaning for me then; but the mere spelling\r\nof the strange words was sufficient to amuse a little child who could do\r\nalmost nothing to amuse herself; and although I do not recall a single\r\ncircumstance connected with the reading of the stories, yet I cannot\r\nhelp thinking that I made a great effort to remember the words, with the\r\nintention of having my teacher explain them when she returned. One thing\r\nis certain, the language was ineffaceably stamped upon my brain, though\r\nfor a long time no one knew it, least of all myself.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Sullivan came back, I did not speak to her about "The Frost\r\nFairies," probably because she began at once to read "Little Lord\r\nFauntleroy," which filled my mind to the exclusion of everything else.\r\nBut the fact remains that Miss Canby\'s story was read to me once, and\r\nthat long after I had forgotten it, it came back to me so naturally that\r\nI never suspected that it was the child of another mind.\r\n\r\nIn my trouble I received many messages of love and sympathy. All the\r\nfriends I loved best, except one, have remained my own to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nMiss Canby herself wrote kindly, "Some day you will write a great story\r\nout of your own head, that will be a comfort and help to many." But this\r\nkind prophecy has never been fulfilled. I have never played with words\r\nagain for the mere pleasure of the game. Indeed, I have ever since been\r\ntortured by the fear that what I write is not my own. For a long time,\r\nwhen I wrote a letter, even to my mother, I was seized with a sudden\r\nfeeling of terror, and I would spell the sentences over and over, to\r\nmake sure that I had not read them in a book. Had it not been for the\r\npersistent encouragement of Miss Sullivan, I think I should have given\r\nup trying to write altogether.\r\n\r\nI have read "The Frost Fairies" since, also the letters I wrote in which\r\nI used other ideas of Miss Canby\'s. I find in one of them, a letter to\r\nMr. Anagnos, dated September 29, 1891, words and sentiments exactly like\r\nthose of the book. At the time I was writing "The Frost King," and this\r\nletter, like many others, contains phrases which show that my mind was\r\nsaturated with the story. I represent my teacher as saying to me of the\r\ngolden autumn leaves, "Yes, they are beautiful enough to comfort us for\r\nthe flight of summer"--an idea direct from Miss Canby\'s story.\r\n\r\nThis habit of assimilating what pleased me and giving it out again as my\r\nown appears in much of my early correspondence and my first attempts at\r\nwriting. In a composition which I wrote about the old cities of Greece\r\nand Italy, I borrowed my glowing descriptions, with variations, from\r\nsources I have forgotten. I knew Mr. Anagnos\'s great love of antiquity\r\nand his enthusiastic appreciation of all beautiful sentiments about\r\nItaly and Greece. I therefore gathered from all the books I read every\r\nbit of poetry or of history that I thought would give him pleasure. Mr.\r\nAnagnos, in speaking of my composition on the cities, has said, "These\r\nideas are poetic in their essence." But I do not understand how he ever\r\nthought a blind and deaf child of eleven could have invented them. Yet\r\nI cannot think that because I did not originate the ideas, my little\r\ncomposition is therefore quite devoid of interest. It shows me that I\r\ncould express my appreciation of beautiful and poetic ideas in clear and\r\nanimated language.\r\n\r\nThose early compositions were mental gymnastics. I was learning, as all\r\nyoung and inexperienced persons learn, by assimilation and imitation,\r\nto put ideas into words. Everything I found in books that pleased me I\r\nretained in my memory, consciously or unconsciously, and adapted it.\r\nThe young writer, as Stevenson has said, instinctively tries to copy\r\nwhatever seems most admirable, and he shifts his admiration with\r\nastonishing versatility. It is only after years of this sort of practice\r\nthat even great men have learned to marshal the legion of words which\r\ncome thronging through every byway of the mind.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have not yet completed this process. It is certain that\r\nI cannot always distinguish my own thoughts from those I read,\r\nbecause what I read becomes the very substance and texture of my mind.\r\nConsequently, in nearly all that I write, I produce something which very\r\nmuch resembles the crazy patchwork I used to make when I first learned\r\nto sew. This patchwork was made of all sorts of odds and ends--pretty\r\nbits of silk and velvet; but the coarse pieces that were not pleasant to\r\ntouch always predominated. Likewise my compositions are made up of crude\r\nnotions of my own, inlaid with the brighter thoughts and riper opinions\r\nof the authors I have read. It seems to me that the great difficulty\r\nof writing is to make the language of the educated mind express our\r\nconfused ideas, half feelings, half thoughts, when we are little more\r\nthan bundles of instinctive tendencies. Trying to write is very much\r\nlike trying to put a Chinese puzzle together. We have a pattern in\r\nmind which we wish to work out in words; but the words will not fit the\r\nspaces, or, if they do, they will not match the design. But we keep\r\non trying because we know that others have succeeded, and we are not\r\nwilling to acknowledge defeat.\r\n\r\n"There is no way to become original, except to be born so," says\r\nStevenson, and although I may not be original, I hope sometime to\r\noutgrow my artificial, periwigged compositions. Then, perhaps, my own\r\nthoughts and experiences will come to the surface. Meanwhile I trust and\r\nhope and persevere, and try not to let the bitter memory of "The Frost\r\nKing" trammel my efforts.\r\n\r\nSo this sad experience may have done me good and set me thinking on some\r\nof the problems of composition. My only regret is that it resulted in\r\nthe loss of one of my dearest friends, Mr. Anagnos.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of "The Story of My Life" in the Ladies\' Home\r\nJournal, Mr. Anagnos has made a statement, in a letter to Mr. Macy, that\r\nat the time of the "Frost King" matter, he believed I was innocent. He\r\nsays, the court of investigation before which I was brought consisted\r\nof eight people: four blind, four seeing persons. Four of them, he says,\r\nthought I knew that Miss Canby\'s story had been read to me, and the\r\nothers did not hold this view. Mr. Anagnos states that he cast his vote\r\nwith those who were favourable to me.\r\n\r\nBut, however the case may have been, with whichever side he may have\r\ncast his vote, when I went into the room where Mr. Anagnos had so often\r\nheld me on his knee and, forgetting his many cares, had shared in my\r\nfrolics, and found there persons who seemed to doubt me, I felt that\r\nthere was something hostile and menacing in the very atmosphere, and\r\nsubsequent events have borne out this impression. For two years he seems\r\nto have held the belief that Miss Sullivan and I were innocent. Then he\r\nevidently retracted his favourable judgment, why I do not know. Nor did\r\nI know the details of the investigation. I never knew even the names of\r\nthe members of the "court" who did not speak to me. I was too excited\r\nto notice anything, too frightened to ask questions. Indeed, I could\r\nscarcely think what I was saying, or what was being said to me.\r\n\r\nI have given this account of the "Frost King" affair because it was\r\nimportant in my life and education; and, in order that there might be no\r\nmisunderstanding, I have set forth all the facts as they appear to me,\r\nwithout a thought of defending myself or of laying blame on any one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nThe summer and winter following the "Frost King" incident I spent with\r\nmy family in Alabama. I recall with delight that home-going. Everything\r\nhad budded and blossomed. I was happy. "The Frost King" was forgotten.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground was strewn with the crimson and golden leaves of autumn,\r\nand the musk-scented grapes that covered the arbour at the end of the\r\ngarden were turning golden brown in the sunshine, I began to write a\r\nsketch of my life--a year after I had written "The Frost King."\r\n\r\nI was still excessively scrupulous about everything I wrote. The thought\r\nthat what I wrote might not be absolutely my own tormented me. No one\r\nknew of these fears except my teacher. A strange sensitiveness prevented\r\nme from referring to the "Frost King"; and often when an idea flashed\r\nout in the course of conversation I would spell softly to her, "I am\r\nnot sure it is mine." At other times, in the midst of a paragraph I was\r\nwriting, I said to myself, "Suppose it should be found that all this was\r\nwritten by some one long ago!" An impish fear clutched my hand, so that\r\nI could not write any more that day. And even now I sometimes feel the\r\nsame uneasiness and disquietude. Miss Sullivan consoled and helped me in\r\nevery way she could think of; but the terrible experience I had passed\r\nthrough left a lasting impression on my mind, the significance of\r\nwhich I am only just beginning to understand. It was with the hope of\r\nrestoring my self-confidence that she persuaded me to write for the\r\nYouth\'s Companion a brief account of my life. I was then twelve years\r\nold. As I look back on my struggle to write that little story, it seems\r\nto me that I must have had a prophetic vision of the good that would\r\ncome of the undertaking, or I should surely have failed.\r\n\r\nI wrote timidly, fearfully, but resolutely, urged on by my teacher, who\r\nknew that if I persevered, I should find my mental foothold again and\r\nget a grip on my faculties. Up to the time of the "Frost King" episode,\r\nI had lived the unconscious life of a little child; now my thoughts were\r\nturned inward, and I beheld things invisible. Gradually I emerged from\r\nthe penumbra of that experience with a mind made clearer by trial and\r\nwith a truer knowledge of life.\r\n\r\nThe chief events of the year 1893 were my trip to Washington during\r\nthe inauguration of President Cleveland, and visits to Niagara and\r\nthe World\'s Fair. Under such circumstances my studies were constantly\r\ninterrupted and often put aside for many weeks, so that it is impossible\r\nfor me to give a connected account of them.\r\n\r\nWe went to Niagara in March, 1893. It is difficult to describe my\r\nemotions when I stood on the point which overhangs the American Falls\r\nand felt the air vibrate and the earth tremble.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange to many people that I should be impressed by the\r\nwonders and beauties of Niagara. They are always asking: "What does this\r\nbeauty or that music mean to you? You cannot see the waves rolling up\r\nthe beach or hear their roar. What do they mean to you?" In the most\r\nevident sense they mean everything. I cannot fathom or define their\r\nmeaning any more than I can fathom or define love or religion or\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1893, Miss Sullivan and I visited the World\'s Fair\r\nwith Dr. Alexander Graham Bell. I recall with unmixed delight those days\r\nwhen a thousand childish fancies became beautiful realities. Every day\r\nin imagination I made a trip round the world, and I saw many wonders\r\nfrom the uttermost parts of the earth--marvels of invention, treasuries\r\nof industry and skill and all the activities of human life actually\r\npassed under my finger tips.\r\n\r\nI liked to visit the Midway Plaisance. It seemed like the "Arabian\r\nNights," it was crammed so full of novelty and interest. Here was\r\nthe India of my books in the curious bazaar with its Shivas and\r\nelephant-gods; there was the land of the Pyramids concentrated in a\r\nmodel Cairo with its mosques and its long processions of camels; yonder\r\nwere the lagoons of Venice, where we sailed every evening when the city\r\nand the fountains were illuminated. I also went on board a Viking\r\nship which lay a short distance from the little craft. I had been on\r\na man-of-war before, in Boston, and it interested me to see, on this\r\nViking ship, how the seaman was once all in all--how he sailed and took\r\nstorm and calm alike with undaunted heart, and gave chase to whosoever\r\nreechoed his cry, "We are of the sea!" and fought with brains and\r\nsinews, self-reliant, self-sufficient, instead of being thrust into the\r\nbackground by unintelligent machinery, as Jack is to-day. So it always\r\nis--"man only is interesting to man."\r\n\r\nAt a little distance from this ship there was a model of the Santa\r\nMaria, which I also examined. The captain showed me Columbus\'s cabin and\r\nthe desk with an hour-glass on it. This small instrument impressed me\r\nmost because it made me think how weary the heroic navigator must have\r\nfelt as he saw the sand dropping grain by grain while desperate men were\r\nplotting against his life.\r\n\r\nMr. Higinbotham, President of the World\'s Fair, kindly gave me\r\npermission to touch the exhibits, and with an eagerness as insatiable\r\nas that with which Pizarro seized the treasures of Peru, I took in\r\nthe glories of the Fair with my fingers. It was a sort of tangible\r\nkaleidoscope, this white city of the West. Everything fascinated me,\r\nespecially the French bronzes. They were so lifelike, I thought they\r\nwere angel visions which the artist had caught and bound in earthly\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape of Good Hope exhibit, I learned much about the processes of\r\nmining diamonds. Whenever it was possible, I touched the machinery\r\nwhile it was in motion, so as to get a clearer idea how the stones were\r\nweighed, cut, and polished. I searched in the washings for a diamond and\r\nfound it myself--the only true diamond, they said, that was ever found\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nDr. Bell went everywhere with us and in his own delightful way described\r\nto me the objects of greatest interest. In the electrical building we\r\nexamined the telephones, autophones, phonographs, and other inventions,\r\nand he made me understand how it is possible to send a message on wires\r\nthat mock space and outrun time, and, like Prometheus, to draw fire from\r\nthe sky. We also visited the anthropological department, and I was much\r\ninterested in the relics of ancient Mexico, in the rude stone implements\r\nthat are so often the only record of an age--the simple monuments of\r\nnature\'s unlettered children (so I thought as I fingered them) that seem\r\nbound to last while the memorials of kings and sages crumble in dust\r\naway--and in the Egyptian mummies, which I shrank from touching. From\r\nthese relics I learned more about the progress of man than I have heard\r\nor read since.\r\n\r\nAll these experiences added a great many new terms to my vocabulary,\r\nand in the three weeks I spent at the Fair I took a long leap from the\r\nlittle child\'s interest in fairy tales and toys to the appreciation of\r\nthe real and the earnest in the workaday world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nBefore October, 1893, I had studied various subjects by myself in a more\r\nor less desultory manner. I read the histories of Greece, Rome and the\r\nUnited States. I had a French grammar in raised print, and as I already\r\nknew some French, I often amused myself by composing in my head short\r\nexercises, using the new words as I came across them, and ignoring rules\r\nand other technicalities as much as possible. I even tried, without\r\naid, to master the French pronunciation, as I found all the letters and\r\nsounds described in the book. Of course this was tasking slender powers\r\nfor great ends; but it gave me something to do on a rainy day, and\r\nI acquired a sufficient knowledge of French to read with pleasure\r\nLa Fontaine\'s "Fables," "Le Medecin Malgre Lui" and passages from\r\n"Athalie."\r\n\r\nI also gave considerable time to the improvement of my speech. I read\r\naloud to Miss Sullivan and recited passages from my favourite poets,\r\nwhich I had committed to memory; she corrected my pronunciation and\r\nhelped me to phrase and inflect. It was not, however, until October,\r\n1893, after I had recovered from the fatigue and excitement of my visit\r\nto the World\'s Fair, that I began to have lessons in special subjects at\r\nfixed hours.\r\n\r\nMiss Sullivan and I were at that time in Hulton, Pennsylvania, visiting\r\nthe family of Mr. William Wade. Mr. Irons, a neighbour of theirs, was\r\na good Latin scholar; it was arranged that I should study under him. I\r\nremember him as a man of rare, sweet nature and of wide experience.\r\nHe taught me Latin grammar principally; but he often helped me in\r\narithmetic, which I found as troublesome as it was uninteresting. Mr.\r\nIrons also read with me Tennyson\'s "In Memoriam." I had read many books\r\nbefore, but never from a critical point of view. I learned for the first\r\ntime to know an author, to recognize his style as I recognize the clasp\r\nof a friend\'s hand.\r\n\r\nAt first I was rather unwilling to study Latin grammar. It seemed absurd\r\nto waste time analyzing, every word I came across--noun, genitive,\r\nsingular, feminine--when its meaning was quite plain. I thought I might\r\njust as well describe my pet in order to know it--order, vertebrate;\r\ndivision, quadruped; class, mammalia; genus, felinus; species, cat;\r\nindividual, Tabby. But as I got deeper into the subject, I became more\r\ninterested, and the beauty of the language delighted me. I often amused\r\nmyself by reading Latin passages, picking up words I understood and\r\ntrying to make sense. I have never ceased to enjoy this pastime.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more beautiful, I think, than the evanescent fleeting\r\nimages and sentiments presented by a language one is just becoming\r\nfamiliar with--ideas that flit across the mental sky, shaped and tinted\r\nby capricious fancy. Miss Sullivan sat beside me at my lessons, spelling\r\ninto my hand whatever Mr. Irons said, and looking up new words for me. I\r\nwas just beginning to read Caesar\'s "Gallic War" when I went to my home\r\nin Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1894, I attended the meeting at Chautauqua of the\r\nAmerican Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf.\r\nThere it was arranged that I should go to the Wright-Humason School for\r\nthe Deaf in New York City. I went there in October, 1894, accompanied\r\nby Miss Sullivan. This school was chosen especially for the purpose\r\nof obtaining the highest advantages in vocal culture and training in\r\nlip-reading. In addition to my work in these subjects, I studied, during\r\nthe two years I was in the school, arithmetic, physical geography,\r\nFrench and German.\r\n\r\nMiss Reamy, my German teacher, could use the manual alphabet, and after\r\nI had acquired a small vocabulary, we talked together in German\r\nwhenever we had a chance, and in a few months I could understand almost\r\neverything she said. Before the end of the first year I read "Wilhelm\r\nTell" with the greatest delight. Indeed, I think I made more progress\r\nin German than in any of my other studies. I found French much more\r\ndifficult. I studied it with Madame Olivier, a French lady who did not\r\nknow the manual alphabet, and who was obliged to give her instruction\r\norally. I could not read her lips easily; so my progress was much slower\r\nthan in German. I managed, however, to read "Le Medecin Malgre Lui"\r\nagain. It was very amusing but I did not like it nearly so well as\r\n"Wilhelm Tell."\r\n\r\nMy progress in lip-reading and speech was not what my teachers and I had\r\nhoped and expected it would be. It was my ambition to speak like other\r\npeople, and my teachers believed that this could be accomplished; but,\r\nalthough we worked hard and faithfully, yet we did not quite reach our\r\ngoal. I suppose we aimed too high, and disappointment was therefore\r\ninevitable. I still regarded arithmetic as a system of pitfalls. I hung\r\nabout the dangerous frontier of "guess," avoiding with infinite\r\ntrouble to myself and others the broad valley of reason. When I was not\r\nguessing, I was jumping at conclusions, and this fault, in addition\r\nto my dullness, aggravated my difficulties more than was right or\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut although these disappointments caused me great depression at times,\r\nI pursued my other studies with unflagging interest, especially physical\r\ngeography. It was a joy to learn the secrets of nature: how--in the\r\npicturesque language of the Old Testament--the winds are made to blow\r\nfrom the four corners of the heavens, how the vapours ascend from the\r\nends of the earth, how rivers are cut out among the rocks, and mountains\r\noverturned by the roots, and in what ways man may overcome many forces\r\nmightier than himself. The two years in New York were happy ones, and I\r\nlook back to them with genuine pleasure.\r\n\r\nI remember especially the walks we all took together every day in\r\nCentral Park, the only part of the city that was congenial to me. I\r\nnever lost a jot of my delight in this great park. I loved to have\r\nit described every time I entered it; for it was beautiful in all its\r\naspects, and these aspects were so many that it was beautiful in a\r\ndifferent way each day of the nine months I spent in New York.\r\n\r\nIn the spring we made excursions to various places of interest. We\r\nsailed on the Hudson River and wandered about on its green banks, of\r\nwhich Bryant loved to sing. I liked the simple, wild grandeur of the\r\npalisades. Among the places I visited were West Point, Tarrytown, the\r\nhome of Washington Irving, where I walked through "Sleepy Hollow."\r\n\r\nThe teachers at the Wright-Humason School were always planning how they\r\nmight give the pupils every advantage that those who hear enjoy--how\r\nthey might make much of few tendencies and passive memories in the cases\r\nof the little ones--and lead them out of the cramping circumstances in\r\nwhich their lives were set.\r\n\r\nBefore I left New York, these bright days were darkened by the greatest\r\nsorrow that I have ever borne, except the death of my father. Mr. John\r\nP. Spaulding, of Boston, died in February, 1896. Only those who knew and\r\nloved him best can understand what his friendship meant to me. He, who\r\nmade every one happy in a beautiful, unobtrusive way, was most kind and\r\ntender to Miss Sullivan and me. So long as we felt his loving presence\r\nand knew that he took a watchful interest in our work, fraught with so\r\nmany difficulties, we could not be discouraged. His going away left a\r\nvacancy in our lives that has never been filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nIn October, 1896, I entered the Cambridge School for Young Ladies, to be\r\nprepared for Radcliffe.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a little girl, I visited Wellesley and surprised my friends\r\nby the announcement, "Some day I shall go to college--but I shall go\r\nto Harvard!" When asked why I would not go to Wellesley, I replied that\r\nthere were only girls there. The thought of going to college took root\r\nin my heart and became an earnest desire, which impelled me to enter\r\ninto competition for a degree with seeing and hearing girls, in the face\r\nof the strong opposition of many true and wise friends. When I left\r\nNew York the idea had become a fixed purpose; and it was decided that\r\nI should go to Cambridge. This was the nearest approach I could get to\r\nHarvard and to the fulfillment of my childish declaration.\r\n\r\nAt the Cambridge School the plan was to have Miss Sullivan attend the\r\nclasses with me and interpret to me the instruction given.\r\n\r\nOf course my instructors had had no experience in teaching any but\r\nnormal pupils, and my only means of conversing with them was reading\r\ntheir lips. My studies for the first year were English history, English\r\nliterature, German, Latin, arithmetic, Latin composition and occasional\r\nthemes. Until then I had never taken a course of study with the idea of\r\npreparing for college; but I had been well drilled in English by Miss\r\nSullivan, and it soon became evident to my teachers that I needed no\r\nspecial instruction in this subject beyond a critical study of the books\r\nprescribed by the college. I had had, moreover, a good start in French,\r\nand received six months\' instruction in Latin; but German was the\r\nsubject with which I was most familiar.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of these advantages, there were serious drawbacks to\r\nmy progress. Miss Sullivan could not spell out in my hand all that the\r\nbooks required, and it was very difficult to have textbooks embossed in\r\ntime to be of use to me, although my friends in London and Philadelphia\r\nwere willing to hasten the work. For a while, indeed, I had to copy\r\nmy Latin in braille, so that I could recite with the other girls. My\r\ninstructors soon became sufficiently familiar with my imperfect speech\r\nto answer my questions readily and correct mistakes. I could not make\r\nnotes in class or write exercises; but I wrote all my compositions and\r\ntranslations at home on my typewriter.\r\n\r\nEach day Miss Sullivan went to the classes with me and spelled into my\r\nhand with infinite patience all that the teachers said. In study hours\r\nshe had to look up new words for me and read and reread notes and books\r\nI did not have in raised print. The tedium of that work is hard to\r\nconceive. Frau Grote, my German teacher, and Mr. Gilman, the principal,\r\nwere the only teachers in the school who learned the finger alphabet to\r\ngive me instruction. No one realized more fully than dear Frau Grote how\r\nslow and inadequate her spelling was. Nevertheless, in the goodness of\r\nher heart she laboriously spelled out her instructions to me in special\r\nlessons twice a week, to give Miss Sullivan a little rest. But, though\r\neverybody was kind and ready to help us, there was only one hand that\r\ncould turn drudgery into pleasure.\r\n\r\nThat year I finished arithmetic, reviewed my Latin grammar, and read\r\nthree chapters of Caesar\'s "Gallic War." In German I read, partly with\r\nmy fingers and partly with Miss Sullivan\'s assistance, Schiller\'s "Lied\r\nvon der Glocke" and "Taucher," Heine\'s "Harzreise," Freytag\'s "Aus dem\r\nStaat Friedrichs des Grossen," Riehl\'s "Fluch Der Schonheit," Lessing\'s\r\n"Minna von Barnhelm," and Goethe\'s "Aus meinem Leben." I took the\r\ngreatest delight in these German books, especially Schiller\'s wonderful\r\nlyrics, the history of Frederick the Great\'s magnificent achievements\r\nand the account of Goethe\'s life. I was sorry to finish "Die Harzreise,"\r\nso full of happy witticisms and charming descriptions of vine-clad\r\nhills, streams that sing and ripple in the sunshine, and wild regions,\r\nsacred to tradition and legend, the gray sisters of a long-vanished,\r\nimaginative age--descriptions such as can be given only by those to whom\r\nnature is "a feeling, a love and an appetite."\r\n\r\nMr. Gilman instructed me part of the year in English literature. We\r\nread together, "As You Like It," Burke\'s "Speech on Conciliation with\r\nAmerica," and Macaulay\'s "Life of Samuel Johnson." Mr. Gilman\'s broad\r\nviews of history and literature and his clever explanations made my\r\nwork easier and pleasanter than it could have been had I only read\r\nnotes mechanically with the necessarily brief explanations given in the\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nBurke\'s speech was more instructive than any other book on a political\r\nsubject that I had ever read. My mind stirred with the stirring times,\r\nand the characters round which the life of two contending nations\r\ncentred seemed to move right before me. I wondered more and more, while\r\nBurke\'s masterly speech rolled on in mighty surges of eloquence, how it\r\nwas that King George and his ministers could have turned a deaf ear\r\nto his warning prophecy of our victory and their humiliation. Then I\r\nentered into the melancholy details of the relation in which the great\r\nstatesman stood to his party and to the representatives of the people. I\r\nthought how strange it was that such precious seeds of truth and wisdom\r\nshould have fallen among the tares of ignorance and corruption.\r\n\r\nIn a different way Macaulay\'s "Life of Samuel Johnson" was interesting.\r\nMy heart went out to the lonely man who ate the bread of affliction in\r\nGrub Street, and yet, in the midst of toil and cruel suffering of body\r\nand soul, always had a kind word, and lent a helping hand to the poor\r\nand despised. I rejoiced over all his successes, I shut my eyes to\r\nhis faults, and wondered, not that he had them, but that they had not\r\ncrushed or dwarfed his soul. But in spite of Macaulay\'s brilliancy\r\nand his admirable faculty of making the commonplace seem fresh and\r\npicturesque, his positiveness wearied me at times, and his frequent\r\nsacrifices of truth to effect kept me in a questioning attitude\r\nvery unlike the attitude of reverence in which I had listened to the\r\nDemosthenes of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAt the Cambridge school, for the first time in my life, I enjoyed the\r\ncompanionship of seeing and hearing girls of my own age. I lived with\r\nseveral others in one of the pleasant houses connected with the school,\r\nthe house where Mr. Howells used to live, and we all had the advantage\r\nof home life. I joined them in many of their games, even blind man\'s\r\nbuff and frolics in the snow; I took long walks with them; we discussed\r\nour studies and read aloud the things that interested us. Some of the\r\ngirls learned to speak to me, so that Miss Sullivan did not have to\r\nrepeat their conversation.\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, my mother and little sister spent the holidays with me,\r\nand Mr. Gilman kindly offered to let Mildred study in his school. So\r\nMildred stayed with me in Cambridge, and for six happy months we were\r\nhardly ever apart. It makes me most happy to remember the hours we spent\r\nhelping each other in study and sharing our recreation together.\r\n\r\nI took my preliminary examinations for Radcliffe from the 29th of June\r\nto the 3rd of July in 1897. The subjects I offered were Elementary and\r\nAdvanced German, French, Latin, English, and Greek and Roman history,\r\nmaking nine hours in all. I passed in everything, and received "honours"\r\nin German and English.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an explanation of the method that was in use when I took my\r\nexaminations will not be amiss here. The student was required to pass in\r\nsixteen hours--twelve hours being called elementary and four advanced.\r\nHe had to pass five hours at a time to have them counted. The\r\nexamination papers were given out at nine o\'clock at Harvard and brought\r\nto Radcliffe by a special messenger. Each candidate was known, not\r\nby his name, but by a number. I was No. 233, but, as I had to use a\r\ntypewriter, my identity could not be concealed.\r\n\r\nIt was thought advisable for me to have my examinations in a room by\r\nmyself, because the noise of the typewriter might disturb the other\r\ngirls. Mr. Gilman read all the papers to me by means of the manual\r\nalphabet. A man was placed on guard at the door to prevent interruption.\r\n\r\nThe first day I had German. Mr. Gilman sat beside me and read the paper\r\nthrough first, then sentence by sentence, while I repeated the words\r\naloud, to make sure that I understood him perfectly. The papers were\r\ndifficult, and I felt very anxious as I wrote out my answers on the\r\ntypewriter. Mr. Gilman spelled to me what I had written, and I made such\r\nchanges as I thought necessary, and he inserted them. I wish to say here\r\nthat I have not had this advantage since in any of my examinations. At\r\nRadcliffe no one reads the papers to me after they are written, and I\r\nhave no opportunity to correct errors unless I finish before the time is\r\nup. In that case I correct only such mistakes as I can recall in the few\r\nminutes allowed, and make notes of these corrections at the end of my\r\npaper. If I passed with higher credit in the preliminaries than in the\r\nfinals, there are two reasons. In the finals, no one read my work over\r\nto me, and in the preliminaries I offered subjects with some of which I\r\nwas in a measure familiar before my work in the Cambridge school; for at\r\nthe beginning of the year I had passed examinations in English, History,\r\nFrench and German, which Mr. Gilman gave me from previous Harvard\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilman sent my written work to the examiners with a certificate that\r\nI, candidate No. 233, had written the papers.\r\n\r\nAll the other preliminary examinations were conducted in the same\r\nmanner. None of them was so difficult as the first. I remember that the\r\nday the Latin paper was brought to us, Professor Schilling came in and\r\ninformed me I had passed satisfactorily in German. This encouraged me\r\ngreatly, and I sped on to the end of the ordeal with a light heart and a\r\nsteady hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWhen I began my second year at the Gilman school, I was full of hope\r\nand determination to succeed. But during the first few weeks I was\r\nconfronted with unforeseen difficulties. Mr. Gilman had agreed that that\r\nyear I should study mathematics principally. I had physics, algebra,\r\ngeometry, astronomy, Greek and Latin. Unfortunately, many of the books\r\nI needed had not been embossed in time for me to begin with the classes,\r\nand I lacked important apparatus for some of my studies. The classes I\r\nwas in were very large, and it was impossible for the teachers to give\r\nme special instruction. Miss Sullivan was obliged to read all the books\r\nto me, and interpret for the instructors, and for the first time in\r\neleven years it seemed as if her dear hand would not be equal to the\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for me to write algebra and geometry in class and solve\r\nproblems in physics, and this I could not do until we bought a braille\r\nwriter, by means of which I could put down the steps and processes of my\r\nwork. I could not follow with my eyes the geometrical figures drawn on\r\nthe blackboard, and my only means of getting a clear idea of them was\r\nto make them on a cushion with straight and curved wires, which had bent\r\nand pointed ends. I had to carry in my mind, as Mr. Keith says in his\r\nreport, the lettering of the figures, the hypothesis and conclusion, the\r\nconstruction and the process of the proof. In a word, every study had\r\nits obstacles. Sometimes I lost all courage and betrayed my feelings in\r\na way I am ashamed to remember, especially as the signs of my trouble\r\nwere afterward used against Miss Sullivan, the only person of all the\r\nkind friends I had there, who could make the crooked straight and the\r\nrough places smooth.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, however, my difficulties began to disappear. The\r\nembossed books and other apparatus arrived, and I threw myself into the\r\nwork with renewed confidence. Algebra and geometry were the only studies\r\nthat continued to defy my efforts to comprehend them. As I have said\r\nbefore, I had no aptitude for mathematics; the different points were\r\nnot explained to me as fully as I wished. The geometrical diagrams\r\nwere particularly vexing because I could not see the relation of the\r\ndifferent parts to one another, even on the cushion. It was not until\r\nMr. Keith taught me that I had a clear idea of mathematics.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to overcome these difficulties when an event occurred\r\nwhich changed everything.\r\n\r\nJust before the books came, Mr. Gilman had begun to remonstrate with\r\nMiss Sullivan on the ground that I was working too hard, and in spite\r\nof my earnest protestations, he reduced the number of my recitations. At\r\nthe beginning we had agreed that I should, if necessary, take five years\r\nto prepare for college, but at the end of the first year the success of\r\nmy examinations showed Miss Sullivan, Miss Harbaugh (Mr. Gilman\'s head\r\nteacher), and one other, that I could without too much effort complete\r\nmy preparation in two years more. Mr. Gilman at first agreed to this;\r\nbut when my tasks had become somewhat perplexing, he insisted that I was\r\noverworked, and that I should remain at his school three years longer. I\r\ndid not like his plan, for I wished to enter college with my class.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of November I was not very well, and did not go\r\nto school. Although Miss Sullivan knew that my indisposition was not\r\nserious, yet Mr. Gilman, on hearing of it, declared that I was breaking\r\ndown and made changes in my studies which would have rendered it\r\nimpossible for me to take my final examinations with my class. In the\r\nend the difference of opinion between Mr. Gilman and Miss Sullivan\r\nresulted in my mother\'s withdrawing my sister Mildred and me from the\r\nCambridge school.\r\n\r\nAfter some delay it was arranged that I should continue my studies under\r\na tutor, Mr. Merton S. Keith, of Cambridge. Miss Sullivan and I spent\r\nthe rest of the winter with our friends, the Chamberlins in Wrentham,\r\ntwenty-five miles from Boston.\r\n\r\nFrom February to July, 1898, Mr. Keith came out to Wrentham twice a\r\nweek, and taught me algebra, geometry, Greek and Latin. Miss Sullivan\r\ninterpreted his instruction.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1898, we returned to Boston. For eight months Mr. Keith gave\r\nme lessons five times a week, in periods of about an hour. He explained\r\neach time what I did not understand in the previous lesson, assigned\r\nnew work, and took home with him the Greek exercises which I had written\r\nduring the week on my typewriter, corrected them fully, and returned\r\nthem to me.\r\n\r\nIn this way my preparation for college went on without interruption.\r\nI found it much easier and pleasanter to be taught by myself than to\r\nreceive instruction in class. There was no hurry, no confusion. My tutor\r\nhad plenty of time to explain what I did not understand, so I got on\r\nfaster and did better work than I ever did in school. I still found more\r\ndifficulty in mastering problems in mathematics than I did in any other\r\nof my studies. I wish algebra and geometry had been half as easy as\r\nthe languages and literature. But even mathematics Mr. Keith made\r\ninteresting; he succeeded in whittling problems small enough to get\r\nthrough my brain. He kept my mind alert and eager, and trained it to\r\nreason clearly, and to seek conclusions calmly and logically, instead of\r\njumping wildly into space and arriving nowhere. He was always gentle and\r\nforbearing, no matter how dull I might be, and believe me, my stupidity\r\nwould often have exhausted the patience of Job.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th and 30th of June, 1899, I took my final examinations for\r\nRadcliffe College. The first day I had Elementary Greek and Advanced\r\nLatin, and the second day Geometry, Algebra and Advanced Greek.\r\n\r\nThe college authorities did not allow Miss Sullivan to read the\r\nexamination papers to me; so Mr. Eugene C. Vining, one of the\r\ninstructors at the Perkins Institution for the Blind, was employed to\r\ncopy the papers for me in American braille. Mr. Vining was a stranger\r\nto me, and could not communicate with me, except by writing braille. The\r\nproctor was also a stranger, and did not attempt to communicate with me\r\nin any way.\r\n\r\nThe braille worked well enough in the languages, but when it came to\r\ngeometry and algebra, difficulties arose. I was sorely perplexed, and\r\nfelt discouraged wasting much precious time, especially in algebra. It\r\nis true that I was familiar with all literary braille in common use in\r\nthis country--English, American, and New York Point; but the various\r\nsigns and symbols in geometry and algebra in the three systems are very\r\ndifferent, and I had used only the English braille in my algebra.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the examinations, Mr. Vining sent me a braille copy of\r\none of the old Harvard papers in algebra. To my dismay I found that it\r\nwas in the American notation. I sat down immediately and wrote to Mr.\r\nVining, asking him to explain the signs. I received another paper and a\r\ntable of signs by return mail, and I set to work to learn the notation.\r\nBut on the night before the algebra examination, while I was struggling\r\nover some very complicated examples, I could not tell the combinations\r\nof bracket, brace and radical. Both Mr. Keith and I were distressed and\r\nfull of forebodings for the morrow; but we went over to the college a\r\nlittle before the examination began, and had Mr. Vining explain more\r\nfully the American symbols.\r\n\r\nIn geometry my chief difficulty was that I had always been accustomed\r\nto read the propositions in line print, or to have them spelled into\r\nmy hand; and somehow, although the propositions were right before me, I\r\nfound the braille confusing, and could not fix clearly in my mind what\r\nI was reading. But when I took up algebra I had a harder time still.\r\nThe signs, which I had so lately learned, and which I thought I knew,\r\nperplexed me. Besides, I could not see what I wrote on my typewriter. I\r\nhad always done my work in braille or in my head. Mr. Keith had relied\r\ntoo much on my ability to solve problems mentally, and had not trained\r\nme to write examination papers. Consequently my work was painfully slow,\r\nand I had to read the examples over and over before I could form any\r\nidea of what I was required to do. Indeed, I am not sure now that I read\r\nall the signs correctly. I found it very hard to keep my wits about me.\r\n\r\nBut I do not blame any one. The administrative board of Radcliffe did\r\nnot realize how difficult they were making my examinations, nor did\r\nthey understand the peculiar difficulties I had to surmount. But if they\r\nunintentionally placed obstacles in my way, I have the consolation of\r\nknowing that I overcame them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nThe struggle for admission to college was ended, and I could now enter\r\nRadcliffe whenever I pleased. Before I entered college, however, it was\r\nthought best that I should study another year under Mr. Keith. It was\r\nnot, therefore, until the fall of 1900 that my dream of going to college\r\nwas realized.\r\n\r\nI remember my first day at Radcliffe. It was a day full of interest\r\nfor me. I had looked forward to it for years. A potent force within\r\nme, stronger than the persuasion of my friends, stronger even than\r\nthe pleadings of my heart, had impelled me to try my strength by the\r\nstandards of those who see and hear. I knew that there were obstacles\r\nin the way; but I was eager to overcome them. I had taken to heart the\r\nwords of the wise Roman who said, "To be banished from Rome is but to\r\nlive outside of Rome." Debarred from the great highways of knowledge,\r\nI was compelled to make the journey across country by unfrequented\r\nroads--that was all; and I knew that in college there were many bypaths\r\nwhere I could touch hands with girls who were thinking, loving and\r\nstruggling like me.\r\n\r\nI began my studies with eagerness. Before me I saw a new world opening\r\nin beauty and light, and I felt within me the capacity to know all\r\nthings. In the wonderland of Mind I should be as free as another. Its\r\npeople, scenery, manners, joys, tragedies should be living, tangible\r\ninterpreters of the real world. The lecture-halls seemed filled with the\r\nspirit of the great and the wise, and I thought the professors were\r\nthe embodiment of wisdom. If I have since learned differently, I am not\r\ngoing to tell anybody.\r\n\r\nBut I soon discovered that college was not quite the romantic lyceum\r\nI had imagined. Many of the dreams that had delighted my young\r\ninexperience became beautifully less and "faded into the light of common\r\nday." Gradually I began to find that there were disadvantages in going\r\nto college.\r\n\r\nThe one I felt and still feel most is lack of time. I used to have time\r\nto think, to reflect, my mind and I. We would sit together of an evening\r\nand listen to the inner melodies of the spirit, which one hears only in\r\nleisure moments when the words of some loved poet touch a deep, sweet\r\nchord in the soul that until then had been silent. But in college there\r\nis no time to commune with one\'s thoughts. One goes to college to learn,\r\nit seems, not to think. When one enters the portals of learning, one\r\nleaves the dearest pleasures--solitude, books and imagination--outside\r\nwith the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in\r\nthe thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I\r\nam improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a\r\nrainy day.\r\n\r\nMy studies the first year were French, German, history, English\r\ncomposition and English literature. In the French course I read some\r\nof the works of Corneille, Moliere, Racine, Alfred de Musset and\r\nSainte-Beuve, and in the German those of Goethe and Schiller. I reviewed\r\nrapidly the whole period of history from the fall of the Roman Empire\r\nto the eighteenth century, and in English literature studied critically\r\nMilton\'s poems and "Areopagitica."\r\n\r\nI am frequently asked how I overcome the peculiar conditions under which\r\nI work in college. In the classroom I am of course practically alone.\r\nThe professor is as remote as if he were speaking through a telephone.\r\nThe lectures are spelled into my hand as rapidly as possible, and much\r\nof the individuality of the lecturer is lost to me in the effort to keep\r\nin the race. The words rush through my hand like hounds in pursuit of a\r\nhare which they often miss. But in this respect I do not think I am much\r\nworse off than the girls who take notes. If the mind is occupied\r\nwith the mechanical process of hearing and putting words on paper at\r\npell-mell speed, I should not think one could pay much attention to the\r\nsubject under consideration or the manner in which it is presented.\r\nI cannot make notes during the lectures, because my hands are busy\r\nlistening. Usually I jot down what I can remember of them when I get\r\nhome. I write the exercises, daily themes, criticisms and hour-tests,\r\nthe mid-year and final examinations, on my typewriter, so that the\r\nprofessors have no difficulty in finding out how little I know. When\r\nI began the study of Latin prosody, I devised and explained to my\r\nprofessor a system of signs indicating the different meters and\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nI use the Hammond typewriter. I have tried many machines, and I find the\r\nHammond is the best adapted to the peculiar needs of my work. With this\r\nmachine movable type shuttles can be used, and one can have several\r\nshuttles, each with a different set of characters--Greek, French, or\r\nmathematical, according to the kind of writing one wishes to do on the\r\ntypewriter. Without it, I doubt if I could go to college.\r\n\r\nVery few of the books required in the various courses are printed\r\nfor the blind, and I am obliged to have them spelled into my hand.\r\nConsequently I need more time to prepare my lessons than other girls.\r\nThe manual part takes longer, and I have perplexities which they have\r\nnot. There are days when the close attention I must give to details\r\nchafes my spirit, and the thought that I must spend hours reading a\r\nfew chapters, while in the world without other girls are laughing and\r\nsinging and dancing, makes me rebellious; but I soon recover my buoyancy\r\nand laugh the discontent out of my heart. For, after all, every one who\r\nwishes to gain true knowledge must climb the Hill Difficulty alone, and\r\nsince there is no royal road to the summit, I must zigzag it in my own\r\nway. I slip back many times, I fall, I stand still, I run against the\r\nedge of hidden obstacles, I lose my temper and find it again and keep\r\nit better, I trudge on, I gain a little, I feel encouraged, I get more\r\neager and climb higher and begin to see the widening horizon. Every\r\nstruggle is a victory. One more effort and I reach the luminous cloud,\r\nthe blue depths of the sky, the uplands of my desire. I am not always\r\nalone, however, in these struggles. Mr. William Wade and Mr. E. E.\r\nAllen, Principal of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of\r\nthe Blind, get for me many of the books I need in raised print. Their\r\nthoughtfulness has been more of a help and encouragement to me than they\r\ncan ever know.\r\n\r\nLast year, my second year at Radcliffe, I studied English composition,\r\nthe Bible as English composition, the governments of America and Europe,\r\nthe Odes of Horace, and Latin comedy. The class in composition was the\r\npleasantest. It was very lively. The lectures were always interesting,\r\nvivacious, witty; for the instructor, Mr. Charles Townsend Copeland,\r\nmore than any one else I have had until this year, brings before you\r\nliterature in all its original freshness and power. For one short hour\r\nyou are permitted to drink in the eternal beauty of the old masters\r\nwithout needless interpretation or exposition. You revel in their fine\r\nthoughts. You enjoy with all your soul the sweet thunder of the Old\r\nTestament, forgetting the existence of Jahweh and Elohim; and you go\r\nhome feeling that you have had "a glimpse of that perfection in which\r\nspirit and form dwell in immortal harmony; truth and beauty bearing a\r\nnew growth on the ancient stem of time."\r\n\r\nThis year is the happiest because I am studying subjects that especially\r\ninterest me, economics, Elizabethan literature, Shakespeare under\r\nProfessor George L. Kittredge, and the History of Philosophy under\r\nProfessor Josiah Royce. Through philosophy one enters with sympathy\r\nof comprehension into the traditions of remote ages and other modes of\r\nthought, which erewhile seemed alien and without reason.\r\n\r\nBut college is not the universal Athens I thought it was. There one does\r\nnot meet the great and the wise face to face; one does not even feel\r\ntheir living touch. They are there, it is true; but they seem mummified.\r\nWe must extract them from the crannied wall of learning and dissect and\r\nanalyze them before we can be sure that we have a Milton or an Isaiah,\r\nand not merely a clever imitation. Many scholars forget, it seems to me,\r\nthat our enjoyment of the great works of literature depends more upon\r\nthe depth of our sympathy than upon our understanding. The trouble is\r\nthat very few of their laborious explanations stick in the memory. The\r\nmind drops them as a branch drops its overripe fruit. It is possible to\r\nknow a flower, root and stem and all, and all the processes of growth,\r\nand yet to have no appreciation of the flower fresh bathed in heaven\'s\r\ndew. Again and again I ask impatiently, "Why concern myself with these\r\nexplanations and hypotheses?" They fly hither and thither in my thought\r\nlike blind birds beating the air with ineffectual wings. I do not mean\r\nto object to a thorough knowledge of the famous works we read. I object\r\nonly to the interminable comments and bewildering criticisms that teach\r\nbut one thing: there are as many opinions as there are men. But when a\r\ngreat scholar like Professor Kittredge interprets what the master\r\nsaid, it is "as if new sight were given the blind." He brings back\r\nShakespeare, the poet.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, times when I long to sweep away half the things I am\r\nexpected to learn; for the overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it\r\nhas secured at the greatest cost. It is impossible, I think, to read in\r\none day four or five different books in different languages and treating\r\nof widely different subjects, and not lose sight of the very ends for\r\nwhich one reads. When one reads hurriedly and nervously, having in mind\r\nwritten tests and examinations, one\'s brain becomes encumbered with a\r\nlot of choice bric-a-brac for which there seems to be little use. At the\r\npresent time my mind is so full of heterogeneous matter that I almost\r\ndespair of ever being able to put it in order. Whenever I enter the\r\nregion that was the kingdom of my mind I feel like the proverbial bull\r\nin the china shop. A thousand odds and ends of knowledge come\r\ncrashing about my head like hailstones, and when I try to escape\r\nthem, theme-goblins and college nixies of all sorts pursue me, until\r\nI wish--oh, may I be forgiven the wicked wish!--that I might smash the\r\nidols I came to worship.\r\n\r\nBut the examinations are the chief bugbears of my college life. Although\r\nI have faced them many times and cast them down and made them bite the\r\ndust, yet they rise again and menace me with pale looks, until like Bob\r\nAcres I feel my courage oozing out at my finger ends. The days before\r\nthese ordeals take place are spent in cramming your mind with mystic\r\nformula and indigestible dates--unpalatable diets, until you wish that\r\nbooks and science and you were buried in the depths of the sea.\r\n\r\nAt last the dreaded hour arrives, and you are a favoured being indeed\r\nif you feel prepared, and are able at the right time to call to your\r\nstandard thoughts that will aid you in that supreme effort. It happens\r\ntoo often that your trumpet call is unheeded. It is most perplexing and\r\nexasperating that just at the moment when you need your memory and a\r\nnice sense of discrimination, these faculties take to themselves wings\r\nand fly away. The facts you have garnered with such infinite trouble\r\ninvariably fail you at a pinch.\r\n\r\n"Give a brief account of Huss and his work." Huss? Who was he and what\r\ndid he do? The name looks strangely familiar. You ransack your budget\r\nof historic facts much as you would hunt for a bit of silk in a rag-bag.\r\nYou are sure it is somewhere in your mind near the top--you saw it\r\nthere the other day when you were looking up the beginnings of the\r\nReformation. But where is it now? You fish out all manner of odds\r\nand ends of knowledge--revolutions, schisms, massacres, systems of\r\ngovernment; but Huss--where is he? You are amazed at all the things you\r\nknow which are not on the examination paper. In desperation you seize\r\nthe budget and dump everything out, and there in a corner is your\r\nman, serenely brooding on his own private thought, unconscious of the\r\ncatastrophe which he has brought upon you.\r\n\r\nJust then the proctor informs you that the time is up. With a feeling of\r\nintense disgust you kick the mass of rubbish into a corner and go home,\r\nyour head full of revolutionary schemes to abolish the divine right of\r\nprofessors to ask questions without the consent of the questioned.\r\n\r\nIt comes over me that in the last two or three pages of this chapter I\r\nhave used figures which will turn the laugh against me. Ah, here they\r\nare--the mixed metaphors mocking and strutting about before me, pointing\r\nto the bull in the china shop assailed by hailstones and the bugbears\r\nwith pale looks, an unanalyzed species! Let them mock on. The words\r\ndescribe so exactly the atmosphere of jostling, tumbling ideas I live\r\nin that I will wink at them for once, and put on a deliberate air to say\r\nthat my ideas of college have changed.\r\n\r\nWhile my days at Radcliffe were still in the future, they were encircled\r\nwith a halo of romance, which they have lost; but in the transition from\r\nromantic to actual I have learned many things I should never have known\r\nhad I not tried the experiment. One of them is the precious science of\r\npatience, which teaches us that we should take our education as we would\r\ntake a walk in the country, leisurely, our minds hospitably open to\r\nimpressions of every sort. Such knowledge floods the soul unseen with a\r\nsoundless tidal wave of deepening thought. "Knowledge is power."\r\nRather, knowledge is happiness, because to have knowledge--broad, deep\r\nknowledge--is to know true ends from false, and lofty things from low.\r\nTo know the thoughts and deeds that have marked man\'s progress is to\r\nfeel the great heart-throbs of humanity through the centuries; and if\r\none does not feel in these pulsations a heavenward striving, one must\r\nindeed be deaf to the harmonies of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nI have thus far sketched the events of my life, but I have not shown how\r\nmuch I have depended on books not only for pleasure and for the wisdom\r\nthey bring to all who read, but also for that knowledge which comes to\r\nothers through their eyes and their ears. Indeed, books have meant so\r\nmuch more in my education than in that of others, that I shall go back\r\nto the time when I began to read.\r\n\r\nI read my first connected story in May, 1887, when I was seven years\r\nold, and from that day to this I have devoured everything in the shape\r\nof a printed page that has come within the reach of my hungry finger\r\ntips. As I have said, I did not study regularly during the early years\r\nof my education; nor did I read according to rule.\r\n\r\nAt first I had only a few books in raised print--"readers" for\r\nbeginners, a collection of stories for children, and a book about the\r\nearth called "Our World." I think that was all; but I read them over\r\nand over, until the words were so worn and pressed I could scarcely\r\nmake them out. Sometimes Miss Sullivan read to me, spelling into my\r\nhand little stories and poems that she knew I should understand; but I\r\npreferred reading myself to being read to, because I liked to read again\r\nand again the things that pleased me.\r\n\r\nIt was during my first visit to Boston that I really began to read\r\nin good earnest. I was permitted to spend a part of each day in the\r\nInstitution library, and to wander from bookcase to bookcase, and take\r\ndown whatever book my fingers lighted upon. And read I did, whether I\r\nunderstood one word in ten or two words on a page. The words themselves\r\nfascinated me; but I took no conscious account of what I read. My mind\r\nmust, however, have been very impressionable at that period, for it\r\nretained many words and whole sentences, to the meaning of which I had\r\nnot the faintest clue; and afterward, when I began to talk and write,\r\nthese words and sentences would flash out quite naturally, so that my\r\nfriends wondered at the richness of my vocabulary. I must have read\r\nparts of many books (in those early days I think I never read any one\r\nbook through) and a great deal of poetry in this uncomprehending way,\r\nuntil I discovered "Little Lord Fauntleroy," which was the first book of\r\nany consequence I read understandingly.\r\n\r\nOne day my teacher found me in a corner of the library poring over\r\nthe pages of "The Scarlet Letter." I was then about eight years old. I\r\nremember she asked me if I liked little Pearl, and explained some of\r\nthe words that had puzzled me. Then she told me that she had a beautiful\r\nstory about a little boy which she was sure I should like better\r\nthan "The Scarlet Letter." The name of the story was "Little Lord\r\nFauntleroy," and she promised to read it to me the following summer. But\r\nwe did not begin the story until August; the first few weeks of my stay\r\nat the seashore were so full of discoveries and excitement that I forgot\r\nthe very existence of books. Then my teacher went to visit some friends\r\nin Boston, leaving me for a short time.\r\n\r\nWhen she returned almost the first thing we did was to begin the story\r\nof "Little Lord Fauntleroy." I recall distinctly the time and place when\r\nwe read the first chapters of the fascinating child\'s story. It was a\r\nwarm afternoon in August. We were sitting together in a hammock which\r\nswung from two solemn pines at a short distance from the house. We had\r\nhurried through the dish-washing after luncheon, in order that we might\r\nhave as long an afternoon as possible for the story. As we hastened\r\nthrough the long grass toward the hammock, the grasshoppers swarmed\r\nabout us and fastened themselves on our clothes, and I remember that\r\nmy teacher insisted upon picking them all off before we sat down, which\r\nseemed to me an unnecessary waste of time. The hammock was covered with\r\npine needles, for it had not been used while my teacher was away. The\r\nwarm sun shone on the pine trees and drew out all their fragrance. The\r\nair was balmy, with a tang of the sea in it. Before we began the story\r\nMiss Sullivan explained to me the things that she knew I should not\r\nunderstand, and as we read on she explained the unfamiliar words.\r\nAt first there were many words I did not know, and the reading was\r\nconstantly interrupted; but as soon as I thoroughly comprehended the\r\nsituation, I became too eagerly absorbed in the story to notice mere\r\nwords, and I am afraid I listened impatiently to the explanations that\r\nMiss Sullivan felt to be necessary. When her fingers were too tired\r\nto spell another word, I had for the first time a keen sense of my\r\ndeprivations. I took the book in my hands and tried to feel the letters\r\nwith an intensity of longing that I can never forget.\r\n\r\nAfterward, at my eager request, Mr. Anagnos had this story embossed,\r\nand I read it again and again, until I almost knew it by heart; and all\r\nthrough my childhood "Little Lord Fauntleroy" was my sweet and gentle\r\ncompanion. I have given these details at the risk of being tedious,\r\nbecause they are in such vivid contrast with my vague, mutable and\r\nconfused memories of earlier reading.\r\n\r\nFrom "Little Lord Fauntleroy" I date the beginning of my true interest\r\nin books. During the next two years I read many books at my home and on\r\nmy visits to Boston. I cannot remember what they all were, or in what\r\norder I read them; but I know that among them were "Greek Heroes," La\r\nFontaine\'s "Fables," Hawthorne\'s "Wonder Book," "Bible Stories," Lamb\'s\r\n"Tales from Shakespeare," "A Child\'s History of England" by Dickens,\r\n"The Arabian Nights," "The Swiss Family Robinson," "The Pilgrim\'s\r\nProgress," "Robinson Crusoe," "Little Women," and "Heidi," a beautiful\r\nlittle story which I afterward read in German. I read them in the\r\nintervals between study and play with an ever-deepening sense of\r\npleasure. I did not study nor analyze them--I did not know whether they\r\nwere well written or not; I never thought about style or authorship.\r\nThey laid their treasures at my feet, and I accepted them as we accept\r\nthe sunshine and the love of our friends. I loved "Little Women" because\r\nit gave me a sense of kinship with girls and boys who could see and\r\nhear. Circumscribed as my life was in so many ways, I had to look\r\nbetween the covers of books for news of the world that lay outside my\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI did not care especially for "The Pilgrim\'s Progress," which I think I\r\ndid not finish, or for the "Fables." I read La Fontaine\'s "Fables" first\r\nin an English translation, and enjoyed them only after a half-hearted\r\nfashion. Later I read the book again in French, and I found that, in\r\nspite of the vivid word-pictures, and the wonderful mastery of language,\r\nI liked it no better. I do not know why it is, but stories in which\r\nanimals are made to talk and act like human beings have never appealed\r\nto me very strongly. The ludicrous caricatures of the animals occupy my\r\nmind to the exclusion of the moral.\r\n\r\nThen, again, La Fontaine seldom, if ever, appeals to our highest moral\r\nsense. The highest chords he strikes are those of reason and self-love.\r\nThrough all the fables runs the thought that man\'s morality springs\r\nwholly from self-love, and that if that self-love is directed and\r\nrestrained by reason, happiness must follow. Now, so far as I can judge,\r\nself-love is the root of all evil; but, of course, I may be wrong, for\r\nLa Fontaine had greater opportunities of observing men than I am likely\r\never to have. I do not object so much to the cynical and satirical\r\nfables as to those in which momentous truths are taught by monkeys and\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\nBut I love "The Jungle Book" and "Wild Animals I Have Known." I feel\r\na genuine interest in the animals themselves, because they are real\r\nanimals and not caricatures of men. One sympathizes with their loves and\r\nhatreds, laughs over their comedies, and weeps over their tragedies. And\r\nif they point a moral, it is so subtle that we are not conscious of it.\r\n\r\nMy mind opened naturally and joyously to a conception of antiquity.\r\nGreece, ancient Greece, exercised a mysterious fascination over me. In\r\nmy fancy the pagan gods and goddesses still walked on earth and talked\r\nface to face with men, and in my heart I secretly built shrines to those\r\nI loved best. I knew and loved the whole tribe of nymphs and heroes\r\nand demigods--no, not quite all, for the cruelty and greed of Medea and\r\nJason were too monstrous to be forgiven, and I used to wonder why\r\nthe gods permitted them to do wrong and then punished them for their\r\nwickedness. And the mystery is still unsolved. I often wonder how\r\n\r\nGod can dumbness keep While Sin creeps grinning through His house of\r\nTime.\r\n\r\nIt was the Iliad that made Greece my paradise. I was familiar with the\r\nstory of Troy before I read it in the original, and consequently I had\r\nlittle difficulty in making the Greek words surrender their treasures\r\nafter I had passed the borderland of grammar. Great poetry, whether\r\nwritten in Greek or in English, needs no other interpreter than a\r\nresponsive heart. Would that the host of those who make the great\r\nworks of the poets odious by their analysis, impositions and laborious\r\ncomments might learn this simple truth! It is not necessary that one\r\nshould be able to define every word and give it its principal parts\r\nand its grammatical position in the sentence in order to understand and\r\nappreciate a fine poem. I know my learned professors have found greater\r\nriches in the Iliad than I shall ever find; but I am not avaricious. I\r\nam content that others should be wiser than I. But with all their wide\r\nand comprehensive knowledge, they cannot measure their enjoyment of that\r\nsplendid epic, nor can I. When I read the finest passages of the Iliad,\r\nI am conscious of a soul-sense that lifts me above the narrow, cramping\r\ncircumstances of my life. My physical limitations are forgotten--my\r\nworld lies upward, the length and the breadth and the sweep of the\r\nheavens are mine!\r\n\r\nMy admiration for the Aeneid is not so great, but it is none the\r\nless real. I read it as much as possible without the help of notes or\r\ndictionary, and I always like to translate the episodes that please me\r\nespecially. The word-painting of Virgil is wonderful sometimes; but his\r\ngods and men move through the scenes of passion and strife and pity and\r\nlove like the graceful figures in an Elizabethan mask, whereas in the\r\nIliad they give three leaps and go on singing. Virgil is serene and\r\nlovely like a marble Apollo in the moonlight; Homer is a beautiful,\r\nanimated youth in the full sunlight with the wind in his hair.\r\n\r\nHow easy it is to fly on paper wings! From "Greek Heroes" to the Iliad\r\nwas no day\'s journey, nor was it altogether pleasant. One could have\r\ntraveled round the word many times while I trudged my weary way through\r\nthe labyrinthine mazes of grammars and dictionaries, or fell into those\r\ndreadful pitfalls called examinations, set by schools and colleges for\r\nthe confusion of those who seek after knowledge. I suppose this sort of\r\nPilgrim\'s Progress was justified by the end; but it seemed interminable\r\nto me, in spite of the pleasant surprises that met me now and then at a\r\nturn in the road.\r\n\r\nI began to read the Bible long before I could understand it. Now it\r\nseems strange to me that there should have been a time when my spirit\r\nwas deaf to its wondrous harmonies; but I remember well a rainy Sunday\r\nmorning when, having nothing else to do, I begged my cousin to read me a\r\nstory out of the Bible. Although she did not think I should understand,\r\nshe began to spell into my hand the story of Joseph and his brothers.\r\nSomehow it failed to interest me. The unusual language and repetition\r\nmade the story seem unreal and far away in the land of Canaan, and I\r\nfell asleep and wandered off to the land of Nod, before the brothers\r\ncame with the coat of many colours unto the tent of Jacob and told their\r\nwicked lie! I cannot understand why the stories of the Greeks should\r\nhave been so full of charm for me, and those of the Bible so devoid\r\nof interest, unless it was that I had made the acquaintance of several\r\nGreeks in Boston and been inspired by their enthusiasm for the stories\r\nof their country; whereas I had not met a single Hebrew or Egyptian, and\r\ntherefore concluded that they were nothing more than barbarians, and the\r\nstories about them were probably all made up, which hypothesis explained\r\nthe repetitions and the queer names. Curiously enough, it never occurred\r\nto me to call Greek patronymics "queer."\r\n\r\nBut how shall I speak of the glories I have since discovered in the\r\nBible? For years I have read it with an ever-broadening sense of joy and\r\ninspiration; and I love it as I love no other book. Still there is much\r\nin the Bible against which every instinct of my being rebels, so much\r\nthat I regret the necessity which has compelled me to read it through\r\nfrom beginning to end. I do not think that the knowledge which I have\r\ngained of its history and sources compensates me for the unpleasant\r\ndetails it has forced upon my attention. For my part, I wish, with Mr.\r\nHowells, that the literature of the past might be purged of all that is\r\nugly and barbarous in it, although I should object as much as any one to\r\nhaving these great works weakened or falsified.\r\n\r\nThere is something impressive, awful, in the simplicity and terrible\r\ndirectness of the book of Esther. Could there be anything more dramatic\r\nthan the scene in which Esther stands before her wicked lord? She knows\r\nher life is in his hands; there is no one to protect her from his wrath.\r\nYet, conquering her woman\'s fear, she approaches him, animated by the\r\nnoblest patriotism, having but one thought: "If I perish, I perish; but\r\nif I live, my people shall live."\r\n\r\nThe story of Ruth, too--how Oriental it is! Yet how different is the\r\nlife of these simple country folks from that of the Persian capital!\r\nRuth is so loyal and gentle-hearted, we cannot help loving her, as she\r\nstands with the reapers amid the waving corn. Her beautiful, unselfish\r\nspirit shines out like a bright star in the night of a dark and cruel\r\nage. Love like Ruth\'s, love which can rise above conflicting creeds and\r\ndeep-seated racial prejudices, is hard to find in all the world.\r\n\r\nThe Bible gives me a deep, comforting sense that "things seen are\r\ntemporal, and things unseen are eternal."\r\n\r\nI do not remember a time since I have been capable of loving books that\r\nI have not loved Shakespeare. I cannot tell exactly when I began Lamb\'s\r\n"Tales from Shakespeare"; but I know that I read them at first with\r\na child\'s understanding and a child\'s wonder. "Macbeth" seems to have\r\nimpressed me most. One reading was sufficient to stamp every detail of\r\nthe story upon my memory forever. For a long time the ghosts and witches\r\npursued me even into Dreamland. I could see, absolutely see, the dagger\r\nand Lady Macbeth\'s little white hand--the dreadful stain was as real to\r\nme as to the grief-stricken queen.\r\n\r\nI read "King Lear" soon after "Macbeth," and I shall never forget the\r\nfeeling of horror when I came to the scene in which Gloster\'s eyes are\r\nput out. Anger seized me, my fingers refused to move, I sat rigid for\r\none long moment, the blood throbbing in my temples, and all the hatred\r\nthat a child can feel concentrated in my heart.\r\n\r\nI must have made the acquaintance of Shylock and Satan about the same\r\ntime, for the two characters were long associated in my mind. I remember\r\nthat I was sorry for them. I felt vaguely that they could not be good\r\neven if they wished to, because no one seemed willing to help them or\r\nto give them a fair chance. Even now I cannot find it in my heart to\r\ncondemn them utterly. There are moments when I feel that the Shylocks,\r\nthe Judases, and even the Devil, are broken spokes in the great wheel of\r\ngood which shall in due time be made whole.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that my first reading of Shakespeare should have left\r\nme so many unpleasant memories. The bright, gentle, fanciful plays--the\r\nones I like best now--appear not to have impressed me at first, perhaps\r\nbecause they reflected the habitual sunshine and gaiety of a child\'s\r\nlife. But "there is nothing more capricious than the memory of a child:\r\nwhat it will hold, and what it will lose."\r\n\r\nI have since read Shakespeare\'s plays many times and know parts of them\r\nby heart, but I cannot tell which of them I like best. My delight in\r\nthem is as varied as my moods. The little songs and the sonnets have a\r\nmeaning for me as fresh and wonderful as the dramas. But, with all my\r\nlove for Shakespeare, it is often weary work to read all the meanings\r\ninto his lines which critics and commentators have given them. I used\r\nto try to remember their interpretations, but they discouraged and vexed\r\nme; so I made a secret compact with myself not to try any more. This\r\ncompact I have only just broken in my study of Shakespeare under\r\nProfessor Kittredge. I know there are many things in Shakespeare, and\r\nin the world, that I do not understand; and I am glad to see veil after\r\nveil lift gradually, revealing new realms of thought and beauty.\r\n\r\nNext to poetry I love history. I have read every historical work that\r\nI have been able to lay my hands on, from a catalogue of dry facts and\r\ndryer dates to Green\'s impartial, picturesque "History of the English\r\nPeople"; from Freeman\'s "History of Europe" to Emerton\'s "Middle Ages."\r\nThe first book that gave me any real sense of the value of history was\r\nSwinton\'s "World History," which I received on my thirteenth birthday.\r\nThough I believe it is no longer considered valid, yet I have kept it\r\never since as one of my treasures. From it I learned how the races of\r\nmen spread from land to land and built great cities, how a few great\r\nrulers, earthly Titans, put everything under their feet, and with a\r\ndecisive word opened the gates of happiness for millions and closed them\r\nupon millions more: how different nations pioneered in art and\r\nknowledge and broke ground for the mightier growths of coming ages; how\r\ncivilization underwent as it were, the holocaust of a degenerate age,\r\nand rose again, like the Phoenix, among the nobler sons of the North;\r\nand how by liberty, tolerance and education the great and the wise have\r\nopened the way for the salvation of the whole world.\r\n\r\nIn my college reading I have become somewhat familiar with French and\r\nGerman literature. The German puts strength before beauty, and truth\r\nbefore convention, both in life and in literature. There is a vehement,\r\nsledge-hammer vigour about everything that he does. When he speaks, it\r\nis not to impress others, but because his heart would burst if he did\r\nnot find an outlet for the thoughts that burn in his soul.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there is in German literature a fine reserve which I like;\r\nbut its chief glory is the recognition I find in it of the redeeming\r\npotency of woman\'s self-sacrificing love. This thought pervades all\r\nGerman literature and is mystically expressed in Goethe\'s "Faust":\r\n\r\nAll things transitory But as symbols are sent. Earth\'s insufficiency\r\nHere grows to event. The indescribable Here it is done. The Woman Soul\r\nleads us upward and on!\r\n\r\nOf all the French writers that I have read, I like Moliere and Racine\r\nbest. There are fine things in Balzac and passages in Merimee which\r\nstrike one like a keen blast of sea air. Alfred de Musset is impossible!\r\nI admire Victor Hugo--I appreciate his genius, his brilliancy, his\r\nromanticism; though he is not one of my literary passions. But Hugo\r\nand Goethe and Schiller and all great poets of all great nations are\r\ninterpreters of eternal things, and my spirit reverently follows them\r\ninto the regions where Beauty and Truth and Goodness are one.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I have written too much about my book-friends, and yet I\r\nhave mentioned only the authors I love most; and from this fact one\r\nmight easily suppose that my circle of friends was very limited and\r\nundemocratic, which would be a very wrong impression. I like many\r\nwriters for many reasons--Carlyle for his ruggedness and scorn of\r\nshams; Wordsworth, who teaches the oneness of man and nature; I find an\r\nexquisite pleasure in the oddities and surprises of Hood, in Herrick\'s\r\nquaintness and the palpable scent of lily and rose in his verses; I like\r\nWhittier for his enthusiasms and moral rectitude. I knew him, and the\r\ngentle remembrance of our friendship doubles the pleasure I have in\r\nreading his poems. I love Mark Twain--who does not? The gods, too, loved\r\nhim and put into his heart all manner of wisdom; then, fearing lest he\r\nshould become a pessimist, they spanned his mind with a rainbow of love\r\nand faith. I like Scott for his freshness, dash and large honesty. I\r\nlove all writers whose minds, like Lowell\'s, bubble up in the sunshine\r\nof optimism--fountains of joy and good will, with occasionally a splash\r\nof anger and here and there a healing spray of sympathy and pity.\r\n\r\nIn a word, literature is my Utopia. Here I am not disfranchised. No\r\nbarrier of the senses shuts me out from the sweet, gracious discourse of\r\nmy book-friends. They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness.\r\nThe things I have learned and the things I have been taught seem of\r\nridiculously little importance compared with their "large loves and\r\nheavenly charities."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nI trust that my readers have not concluded from the preceding chapter on\r\nbooks that reading is my only pleasure; my pleasures and amusements are\r\nmany and varied.\r\n\r\nMore than once in the course of my story I have referred to my love of\r\nthe country and out-of-door sports. When I was quite a little girl, I\r\nlearned to row and swim, and during the summer, when I am at Wrentham,\r\nMassachusetts, I almost live in my boat. Nothing gives me greater\r\npleasure than to take my friends out rowing when they visit me. Of\r\ncourse, I cannot guide the boat very well. Some one usually sits in\r\nthe stern and manages the rudder while I row. Sometimes, however, I go\r\nrowing without the rudder. It is fun to try to steer by the scent of\r\nwatergrasses and lilies, and of bushes that grow on the shore. I use\r\noars with leather bands, which keep them in position in the oarlocks,\r\nand I know by the resistance of the water when the oars are evenly\r\npoised. In the same manner I can also tell when I am pulling against the\r\ncurrent. I like to contend with wind and wave. What is more exhilarating\r\nthan to make your staunch little boat, obedient to your will and muscle,\r\ngo skimming lightly over glistening, tilting waves, and to feel the\r\nsteady, imperious surge of the water!\r\n\r\nI also enjoy canoeing, and I suppose you will smile when I say that I\r\nespecially like it on moonlight nights. I cannot, it is true, see the\r\nmoon climb up the sky behind the pines and steal softly across the\r\nheavens, making a shining path for us to follow; but I know she is\r\nthere, and as I lie back among the pillows and put my hand in the water,\r\nI fancy that I feel the shimmer of her garments as she passes. Sometimes\r\na daring little fish slips between my fingers, and often a pond-lily\r\npresses shyly against my hand. Frequently, as we emerge from the shelter\r\nof a cove or inlet, I am suddenly conscious of the spaciousness of the\r\nair about me. A luminous warmth seems to enfold me. Whether it comes\r\nfrom the trees which have been heated by the sun, or from the water, I\r\ncan never discover. I have had the same strange sensation even in the\r\nheart of the city. I have felt it on cold, stormy days and at night. It\r\nis like the kiss of warm lips on my face.\r\n\r\nMy favourite amusement is sailing. In the summer of 1901 I visited Nova\r\nScotia, and had opportunities such as I had not enjoyed before to make\r\nthe acquaintance of the ocean. After spending a few days in Evangeline\'s\r\ncountry, about which Longfellow\'s beautiful poem has woven a spell of\r\nenchantment, Miss Sullivan and I went to Halifax, where we remained the\r\ngreater part of the summer. The harbour was our joy, our paradise. What\r\nglorious sails we had to Bedford Basin, to McNabb\'s Island, to York\r\nRedoubt, and to the Northwest Arm! And at night what soothing, wondrous\r\nhours we spent in the shadow of the great, silent men-of-war. Oh, it was\r\nall so interesting, so beautiful! The memory of it is a joy forever.\r\n\r\nOne day we had a thrilling experience. There was a regatta in the\r\nNorthwest Arm, in which the boats from the different warships were\r\nengaged. We went in a sail-boat along with many others to watch the\r\nraces. Hundreds of little sail-boats swung to and fro close by, and\r\nthe sea was calm. When the races were over, and we turned our faces\r\nhomeward, one of the party noticed a black cloud drifting in from the\r\nsea, which grew and spread and thickened until it covered the whole sky.\r\nThe wind rose, and the waves chopped angrily at unseen barriers. Our\r\nlittle boat confronted the gale fearlessly; with sails spread and ropes\r\ntaut, she seemed to sit upon the wind. Now she swirled in the billows,\r\nnow she sprang upward on a gigantic wave, only to be driven down with\r\nangry howl and hiss. Down came the mainsail. Tacking and jibbing,\r\nwe wrestled with opposing winds that drove us from side to side with\r\nimpetuous fury. Our hearts beat fast, and our hands trembled with\r\nexcitement, not fear, for we had the hearts of vikings, and we knew that\r\nour skipper was master of the situation. He had steered through many\r\na storm with firm hand and sea-wise eye. As they passed us, the large\r\ncraft and the gunboats in the harbour saluted and the seamen shouted\r\napplause for the master of the only little sail-boat that ventured out\r\ninto the storm. At last, cold, hungry and weary, we reached our pier.\r\n\r\nLast summer I spent in one of the loveliest nooks of one of the most\r\ncharming villages in New England. Wrentham, Massachusetts, is associated\r\nwith nearly all of my joys and sorrows. For many years Red Farm, by King\r\nPhilip\'s Pond, the home of Mr. J. E. Chamberlin and his family, was\r\nmy home. I remember with deepest gratitude the kindness of these dear\r\nfriends and the happy days I spent with them. The sweet companionship\r\nof their children meant much to me. I joined in all their sports and\r\nrambles through the woods and frolics in the water. The prattle of the\r\nlittle ones and their pleasure in the stories I told them of elf and\r\ngnome, of hero and wily bear, are pleasant things to remember. Mr.\r\nChamberlin initiated me into the mysteries of tree and wild-flower,\r\nuntil with the little ear of love I heard the flow of sap in the oak,\r\nand saw the sun glint from leaf to leaf. Thus it is that\r\n\r\n  Even as the roots, shut in the darksome earth,\r\n  Share in the tree-top\'s joyance, and conceive\r\n  Of sunshine and wide air and wing\xc3\xa9d things,\r\n  By sympathy of nature, so do I\r\n  have evidence of things unseen.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there is in each of us a capacity to comprehend the\r\nimpressions and emotions which have been experienced by mankind from the\r\nbeginning. Each individual has a subconscious memory of the green earth\r\nand murmuring waters, and blindness and deafness cannot rob him of this\r\ngift from past generations. This inherited capacity is a sort of sixth\r\nsense--a soul-sense which sees, hears, feels, all in one.\r\n\r\nI have many tree friends in Wrentham. One of them, a splendid oak, is\r\nthe special pride of my heart. I take all my other friends to see this\r\nking-tree. It stands on a bluff overlooking King Philip\'s Pond, and\r\nthose who are wise in tree lore say it must have stood there eight\r\nhundred or a thousand years. There is a tradition that under this tree\r\nKing Philip, the heroic Indian chief, gazed his last on earth and sky.\r\n\r\nI had another tree friend, gentle and more approachable than the great\r\noak--a linden that grew in the dooryard at Red Farm. One afternoon,\r\nduring a terrible thunderstorm, I felt a tremendous crash against the\r\nside of the house and knew, even before they told me, that the linden\r\nhad fallen. We went out to see the hero that had withstood so many\r\ntempests, and it wrung my heart to see him prostrate who had mightily\r\nstriven and was now mightily fallen.\r\n\r\nBut I must not forget that I was going to write about last summer in\r\nparticular. As soon as my examinations were over, Miss Sullivan and I\r\nhastened to this green nook, where we have a little cottage on one of\r\nthe three lakes for which Wrentham is famous. Here the long, sunny days\r\nwere mine, and all thoughts of work and college and the noisy city were\r\nthrust into the background. In Wrentham we caught echoes of what was\r\nhappening in the world--war, alliance, social conflict. We heard of the\r\ncruel, unnecessary fighting in the far-away Pacific, and learned of the\r\nstruggles going on between capital and labour. We knew that beyond the\r\nborder of our Eden men were making history by the sweat of their brows\r\nwhen they might better make a holiday. But we little heeded these\r\nthings. These things would pass away; here were lakes and woods and\r\nbroad daisy-starred fields and sweet-breathed meadows, and they shall\r\nendure forever.\r\n\r\nPeople who think that all sensations reach us through the eye and the\r\near have expressed surprise that I should notice any difference, except\r\npossibly the absence of pavements, between walking in city streets\r\nand in country roads. They forget that my whole body is alive to the\r\nconditions about me. The rumble and roar of the city smite the nerves of\r\nmy face, and I feel the ceaseless tramp of an unseen multitude, and the\r\ndissonant tumult frets my spirit. The grinding of heavy wagons on hard\r\npavements and the monotonous clangour of machinery are all the more\r\ntorturing to the nerves if one\'s attention is not diverted by the\r\npanorama that is always present in the noisy streets to people who can\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nIn the country one sees only Nature\'s fair works, and one\'s soul is not\r\nsaddened by the cruel struggle for mere existence that goes on in the\r\ncrowded city. Several times I have visited the narrow, dirty streets\r\nwhere the poor live, and I grow hot and indignant to think that good\r\npeople should be content to live in fine houses and become strong\r\nand beautiful, while others are condemned to live in hideous, sunless\r\ntenements and grow ugly, withered and cringing. The children who crowd\r\nthese grimy alleys, half-clad and underfed, shrink away from your\r\noutstretched hand as if from a blow. Dear little creatures, they crouch\r\nin my heart and haunt me with a constant sense of pain. There are men\r\nand women, too, all gnarled and bent out of shape. I have felt their\r\nhard, rough hands and realized what an endless struggle their existence\r\nmust be--no more than a series of scrimmages, thwarted attempts to do\r\nsomething. Their life seems an immense disparity between effort and\r\nopportunity. The sun and the air are God\'s free gifts to all we say, but\r\nare they so? In yonder city\'s dingy alleys the sun shines not, and the\r\nair is foul. Oh, man, how dost thou forget and obstruct thy brother man,\r\nand say, "Give us this day our daily bread," when he has none! Oh, would\r\nthat men would leave the city, its splendour and its tumult and its\r\ngold, and return to wood and field and simple, honest living! Then would\r\ntheir children grow stately as noble trees, and their thoughts sweet and\r\npure as wayside flowers. It is impossible not to think of all this when\r\nI return to the country after a year of work in town.\r\n\r\nWhat a joy it is to feel the soft, springy earth under my feet once\r\nmore, to follow grassy roads that lead to ferny brooks where I can bathe\r\nmy fingers in a cataract of rippling notes, or to clamber over a\r\nstone wall into green fields that tumble and roll and climb in riotous\r\ngladness!\r\n\r\nNext to a leisurely walk I enjoy a "spin" on my tandem bicycle. It is\r\nsplendid to feel the wind blowing in my face and the springy motion of\r\nmy iron steed. The rapid rush through the air gives me a delicious sense\r\nof strength and buoyancy, and the exercise makes my pulses dance and my\r\nheart sing.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is possible, my dog accompanies me on a walk or ride or\r\nsail. I have had many dog friends--huge mastiffs, soft-eyed spaniels,\r\nwood-wise setters and honest, homely bull terriers. At present the lord\r\nof my affections is one of these bull terriers. He has a long pedigree,\r\na crooked tail and the drollest "phiz" in dogdom. My dog friends seem\r\nto understand my limitations, and always keep close beside me when I\r\nam alone. I love their affectionate ways and the eloquent wag of their\r\ntails.\r\n\r\nWhen a rainy day keeps me indoors, I amuse myself after the manner of\r\nother girls. I like to knit and crochet; I read in the happy-go-lucky\r\nway I love, here and there a line; or perhaps I play a game or two of\r\ncheckers or chess with a friend. I have a special board on which I play\r\nthese games. The squares are cut out, so that the men stand in them\r\nfirmly. The black checkers are flat and the white ones curved on top.\r\nEach checker has a hole in the middle in which a brass knob can be\r\nplaced to distinguish the king from the commons. The chessmen are of\r\ntwo sizes, the white larger than the black, so that I have no trouble\r\nin following my opponent\'s maneuvers by moving my hands lightly over the\r\nboard after a play. The jar made by shifting the men from one hole to\r\nanother tells me when it is my turn.\r\n\r\nIf I happen to be all alone and in an idle mood, I play a game of\r\nsolitaire, of which I am very fond. I use playing cards marked in the\r\nupper right-hand corner with braille symbols which indicate the value of\r\nthe card.\r\n\r\nIf there are children around, nothing pleases me so much as to frolic\r\nwith them. I find even the smallest child excellent company, and I am\r\nglad to say that children usually like me. They lead me about and show\r\nme the things they are interested in. Of course the little ones cannot\r\nspell on their fingers; but I manage to read their lips. If I do not\r\nsucceed they resort to dumb show. Sometimes I make a mistake and do the\r\nwrong thing. A burst of childish laughter greets my blunder, and the\r\npantomime begins all over again. I often tell them stories or teach them\r\na game, and the winged hours depart and leave us good and happy.\r\n\r\nMuseums and art stores are also sources of pleasure and inspiration.\r\nDoubtless it will seem strange to many that the hand unaided by sight\r\ncan feel action, sentiment, beauty in the cold marble; and yet it is\r\ntrue that I derive genuine pleasure from touching great works of art.\r\nAs my finger tips trace line and curve, they discover the thought and\r\nemotion which the artist has portrayed. I can feel in the faces of gods\r\nand heroes hate, courage and love, just as I can detect them in living\r\nfaces I am permitted to touch. I feel in Diana\'s posture the grace and\r\nfreedom of the forest and the spirit that tames the mountain lion\r\nand subdues the fiercest passions. My soul delights in the repose and\r\ngracious curves of the Venus; and in Barre\'s bronzes the secrets of the\r\njungle are revealed to me.\r\n\r\nA medallion of Homer hangs on the wall of my study, conveniently low, so\r\nthat I can easily reach it and touch the beautiful, sad face with loving\r\nreverence. How well I know each line in that majestic brow--tracks of\r\nlife and bitter evidences of struggle and sorrow; those sightless eyes\r\nseeking, even in the cold plaster, for the light and the blue skies of\r\nhis beloved Hellas, but seeking in vain; that beautiful mouth, firm and\r\ntrue and tender. It is the face of a poet, and of a man acquainted with\r\nsorrow. Ah, how well I understand his deprivation--the perpetual night\r\nin which he dwelt--\r\n\r\nO dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon, Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse\r\nWithout all hope of day!\r\n\r\nIn imagination I can hear Homer singing, as with unsteady, hesitating\r\nsteps he gropes his way from camp to camp--singing of life, of love, of\r\nwar, of the splendid achievements of a noble race. It was a wonderful,\r\nglorious song, and it won the blind poet an immortal crown, the\r\nadmiration of all ages.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wonder if the hand is not more sensitive to the beauties of\r\nsculpture than the eye. I should think the wonderful rhythmical flow of\r\nlines and curves could be more subtly felt than seen. Be this as it may,\r\nI know that I can feel the heart-throbs of the ancient Greeks in their\r\nmarble gods and goddesses.\r\n\r\nAnother pleasure, which comes more rarely than the others, is going to\r\nthe theatre. I enjoy having a play described to me while it is being\r\nacted on the stage far more than reading it, because then it seems as if\r\nI were living in the midst of stirring events. It has been my privilege\r\nto meet a few great actors and actresses who have the power of so\r\nbewitching you that you forget time and place and live again in the\r\nromantic past. I have been permitted to touch the face and costume of\r\nMiss Ellen Terry as she impersonated our ideal of a queen; and there was\r\nabout her that divinity that hedges sublimest woe. Beside her stood Sir\r\nHenry Irving, wearing the symbols of kingship; and there was majesty of\r\nintellect in his every gesture and attitude and the royalty that subdues\r\nand overcomes in every line of his sensitive face. In the king\'s face,\r\nwhich he wore as a mask, there was a remoteness and inaccessibility of\r\ngrief which I shall never forget.\r\n\r\nI also know Mr. Jefferson. I am proud to count him among my friends. I\r\ngo to see him whenever I happen to be where he is acting. The first\r\ntime I saw him act was while at school in New York. He played "Rip Van\r\nWinkle." I had often read the story, but I had never felt the charm of\r\nRip\'s slow, quaint, kind ways as I did in the play. Mr. Jefferson\'s,\r\nbeautiful, pathetic representation quite carried me away with delight.\r\nI have a picture of old Rip in my fingers which they will never lose.\r\nAfter the play Miss Sullivan took me to see him behind the scenes, and\r\nI felt of his curious garb and his flowing hair and beard. Mr. Jefferson\r\nlet me touch his face so that I could imagine how he looked on waking\r\nfrom that strange sleep of twenty years, and he showed me how poor old\r\nRip staggered to his feet.\r\n\r\nI have also seen him in "The Rivals." Once while I was calling on him\r\nin Boston he acted the most striking parts of "The Rivals" for me. The\r\nreception-room where we sat served for a stage. He and his son seated\r\nthemselves at the big table, and Bob Acres wrote his challenge. I\r\nfollowed all his movements with my hands, and caught the drollery of his\r\nblunders and gestures in a way that would have been impossible had it\r\nall been spelled to me. Then they rose to fight the duel, and I followed\r\nthe swift thrusts and parries of the swords and the waverings of poor\r\nBob as his courage oozed out at his finger ends. Then the great actor\r\ngave his coat a hitch and his mouth a twitch, and in an instant I was in\r\nthe village of Falling Water and felt Schneider\'s shaggy head against my\r\nknee. Mr. Jefferson recited the best dialogues of "Rip Van Winkle," in\r\nwhich the tear came close upon the smile. He asked me to indicate as\r\nfar as I could the gestures and action that should go with the lines. Of\r\ncourse, I have no sense whatever of dramatic action, and could make only\r\nrandom guesses; but with masterful art he suited the action to the word.\r\nThe sigh of Rip as he murmurs, "Is a man so soon forgotten when he is\r\ngone?" the dismay with which he searches for dog and gun after his\r\nlong sleep, and his comical irresolution over signing the contract with\r\nDerrick--all these seem to be right out of life itself; that is, the\r\nideal life, where things happen as we think they should.\r\n\r\nI remember well the first time I went to the theatre. It was twelve\r\nyears ago. Elsie Leslie, the little actress, was in Boston, and Miss\r\nSullivan took me to see her in "The Prince and the Pauper." I shall\r\nnever forget the ripple of alternating joy and woe that ran through that\r\nbeautiful little play, or the wonderful child who acted it. After the\r\nplay I was permitted to go behind the scenes and meet her in her royal\r\ncostume. It would have been hard to find a lovelier or more lovable\r\nchild than Elsie, as she stood with a cloud of golden hair floating over\r\nher shoulders, smiling brightly, showing no signs of shyness or fatigue,\r\nthough she had been playing to an immense audience. I was only just\r\nlearning to speak, and had previously repeated her name until I could\r\nsay it perfectly. Imagine my delight when she understood the few words I\r\nspoke to her and without hesitation stretched her hand to greet me.\r\n\r\nIs it not true, then, that my life with all its limitations touches at\r\nmany points the life of the World Beautiful? Everything has its wonders,\r\neven darkness and silence, and I learn, whatever state I may be in,\r\ntherein to be content.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is true, a sense of isolation enfolds me like a cold mist\r\nas I sit alone and wait at life\'s shut gate. Beyond there is light,\r\nand music, and sweet companionship; but I may not enter. Fate, silent,\r\npitiless, bars the way. Fain would I question his imperious decree, for\r\nmy heart is still undisciplined and passionate; but my tongue will not\r\nutter the bitter, futile words that rise to my lips, and they fall back\r\ninto my heart like unshed tears. Silence sits immense upon my soul.\r\nThen comes hope with a smile and whispers, "There is joy in\r\nself-forgetfulness." So I try to make the light in others\' eyes my sun,\r\nthe music in others\' ears my symphony, the smile on others\' lips my\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nWould that I could enrich this sketch with the names of all those who\r\nhave ministered to my happiness! Some of them would be found written\r\nin our literature and dear to the hearts of many, while others would\r\nbe wholly unknown to most of my readers. But their influence, though it\r\nescapes fame, shall live immortal in the lives that have been sweetened\r\nand ennobled by it. Those are red-letter days in our lives when we meet\r\npeople who thrill us like a fine poem, people whose handshake is brimful\r\nof unspoken sympathy, and whose sweet, rich natures impart to our eager,\r\nimpatient spirits a wonderful restfulness which, in its essence, is\r\ndivine. The perplexities, irritations and worries that have absorbed us\r\npass like unpleasant dreams, and we wake to see with new eyes and hear\r\nwith new ears the beauty and harmony of God\'s real world. The solemn\r\nnothings that fill our everyday life blossom suddenly into bright\r\npossibilities. In a word, while such friends are near us we feel that\r\nall is well. Perhaps we never saw them before, and they may never cross\r\nour life\'s path again; but the influence of their calm, mellow natures\r\nis a libation poured upon our discontent, and we feel its healing touch,\r\nas the ocean feels the mountain stream freshening its brine.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked, "Do not people bore you?" I do not understand\r\nquite what that means. I suppose the calls of the stupid and curious,\r\nespecially of newspaper reporters, are always inopportune. I also\r\ndislike people who try to talk down to my understanding. They are like\r\npeople who when walking with you try to shorten their steps to suit\r\nyours; the hypocrisy in both cases is equally exasperating.\r\n\r\nThe hands of those I meet are dumbly eloquent to me. The touch of some\r\nhands is an impertinence. I have met people so empty of joy, that when\r\nI clasped their frosty finger tips, it seemed as if I were shaking hands\r\nwith a northeast storm. Others there are whose hands have sunbeams in\r\nthem, so that their grasp warms my heart. It may be only the clinging\r\ntouch of a child\'s hand; but there is as much potential sunshine in it\r\nfor me as there is in a loving glance for others. A hearty handshake or\r\na friendly letter gives me genuine pleasure.\r\n\r\nI have many far-off friends whom I have never seen. Indeed they are so\r\nmany that I have often been unable to reply to their letters; but I\r\nwish to say here that I am always grateful for their kind words, however\r\ninsufficiently I acknowledge them.\r\n\r\nI count it one of the sweetest privileges of my life to have known and\r\nconversed with many men of genius. Only those who knew Bishop Brooks can\r\nappreciate the joy his friendship was to those who possessed it. As a\r\nchild I loved to sit on his knee and clasp his great hand with one of\r\nmine, while Miss Sullivan spelled into the other his beautiful words\r\nabout God and the spiritual world. I heard him with a child\'s wonder\r\nand delight. My spirit could not reach up to his, but he gave me a real\r\nsense of joy in life, and I never left him without carrying away a fine\r\nthought that grew in beauty and depth of meaning as I grew. Once, when I\r\nwas puzzled to know why there were so many religions, he said: "There is\r\none universal religion, Helen--the religion of love. Love your Heavenly\r\nFather with your whole heart and soul, love every child of God as much\r\nas ever you can, and remember that the possibilities of good are greater\r\nthan the possibilities of evil; and you have the key to Heaven." And\r\nhis life was a happy illustration of this great truth. In his noble\r\nsoul love and widest knowledge were blended with faith that had become\r\ninsight. He saw\r\n\r\n     God in all that liberates and lifts,\r\n     In all that humbles, sweetens and consoles.\r\n\r\nBishop Brooks taught me no special creed or dogma; but he impressed upon\r\nmy mind two great ideas--the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of\r\nman, and made me feel that these truths underlie all creeds and forms of\r\nworship. God is love, God is our Father, we are His children; therefore\r\nthe darkest clouds will break and though right be worsted, wrong shall\r\nnot triumph.\r\n\r\nI am too happy in this world to think much about the future, except\r\nto remember that I have cherished friends awaiting me there in God\'s\r\nbeautiful Somewhere. In spite of the lapse of years, they seem so close\r\nto me that I should not think it strange if at any moment they should\r\nclasp my hand and speak words of endearment as they used to before they\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\nSince Bishop Brooks died I have read the Bible through; also some\r\nphilosophical works on religion, among them Swedenborg\'s "Heaven and\r\nHell" and Drummond\'s "Ascent of Man," and I have found no creed or\r\nsystem more soul-satisfying than Bishop Brooks\'s creed of love. I knew\r\nMr. Henry Drummond, and the memory of his strong, warm hand-clasp is\r\nlike a benediction. He was the most sympathetic of companions. He knew\r\nso much and was so genial that it was impossible to feel dull in his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nI remember well the first time I saw Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. He had\r\ninvited Miss Sullivan and me to call on him one Sunday afternoon. It was\r\nearly in the spring, just after I had learned to speak. We were shown\r\nat once to his library where we found him seated in a big armchair by an\r\nopen fire which glowed and crackled on the hearth, thinking, he said, of\r\nother days.\r\n\r\n"And listening to the murmur of the River Charles," I suggested.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied, "the Charles has many dear associations for me."\r\nThere was an odour of print and leather in the room which told me that\r\nit was full of books, and I stretched out my hand instinctively to find\r\nthem. My fingers lighted upon a beautiful volume of Tennyson\'s poems,\r\nand when Miss Sullivan told me what it was I began to recite:\r\n\r\nBreak, break, break On thy cold gray stones, O sea!\r\n\r\nBut I stopped suddenly. I felt tears on my hand. I had made my beloved\r\npoet weep, and I was greatly distressed. He made me sit in his armchair,\r\nwhile he brought different interesting things for me to examine, and\r\nat his request I recited "The Chambered Nautilus," which was then my\r\nfavorite poem. After that I saw Dr. Holmes many times and learned to\r\nlove the man as well as the poet.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful summer day, not long after my meeting with Dr. Holmes,\r\nMiss Sullivan and I visited Whittier in his quiet home on the Merrimac.\r\nHis gentle courtesy and quaint speech won my heart. He had a book of\r\nhis poems in raised print from which I read "In School Days." He was\r\ndelighted that I could pronounce the words so well, and said that he had\r\nno difficulty in understanding me. Then I asked many questions about the\r\npoem, and read his answers by placing my fingers on his lips. He said he\r\nwas the little boy in the poem, and that the girl\'s name was Sally, and\r\nmore which I have forgotten. I also recited "Laus Deo," and as I spoke\r\nthe concluding verses, he placed in my hands a statue of a slave from\r\nwhose crouching figure the fetters were falling, even as they fell from\r\nPeter\'s limbs when the angel led him forth out of prison. Afterward we\r\nwent into his study, and he wrote his autograph for my teacher ["With\r\ngreat admiration of thy noble work in releasing from bondage the mind of\r\nthy dear pupil, I am truly thy friend. john J. Whittier."] and expressed\r\nhis admiration of her work, saying to me, "She is thy spiritual\r\nliberator." Then he led me to the gate and kissed me tenderly on my\r\nforehead. I promised to visit him again the following summer, but he\r\ndied before the promise was fulfilled.\r\n\r\nDr. Edward Everett Hale is one of my very oldest friends. I have known\r\nhim since I was eight, and my love for him has increased with my years.\r\nHis wise, tender sympathy has been the support of Miss Sullivan and me\r\nin times of trial and sorrow, and his strong hand has helped us over\r\nmany rough places; and what he has done for us he has done for thousands\r\nof those who have difficult tasks to accomplish. He has filled the old\r\nskins of dogma with the new wine of love, and shown men what it is to\r\nbelieve, live and be free. What he has taught we have seen beautifully\r\nexpressed in his own life--love of country, kindness to the least of his\r\nbrethren, and a sincere desire to live upward and onward. He has been\r\na prophet and an inspirer of men, and a mighty doer of the Word, the\r\nfriend of all his race--God bless him!\r\n\r\nI have already written of my first meeting with Dr. Alexander Graham\r\nBell. Since then I have spent many happy days with him at Washington and\r\nat his beautiful home in the heart of Cape Breton Island, near Baddeck,\r\nthe village made famous by Charles Dudley Warner\'s book. Here in Dr.\r\nBell\'s laboratory, or in the fields on the shore of the great Bras d\'Or,\r\nI have spent many delightful hours listening to what he had to tell me\r\nabout his experiments, and helping him fly kites by means of which he\r\nexpects to discover the laws that shall govern the future air-ship. Dr.\r\nBell is proficient in many fields of science, and has the art of making\r\nevery subject he touches interesting, even the most abstruse theories.\r\nHe makes you feel that if you only had a little more time, you, too,\r\nmight be an inventor. He has a humorous and poetic side, too. His\r\ndominating passion is his love for children. He is never quite so happy\r\nas when he has a little deaf child in his arms. His labours in behalf of\r\nthe deaf will live on and bless generations of children yet to come; and\r\nwe love him alike for what he himself has achieved and for what he has\r\nevoked from others.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years I spent in New York I had many opportunities to\r\ntalk with distinguished people whose names I had often heard, but whom I\r\nhad never expected to meet. Most of them I met first in the house of my\r\ngood friend, Mr. Laurence Hutton. It was a great privilege to visit him\r\nand dear Mrs. Hutton in their lovely home, and see their library and\r\nread the beautiful sentiments and bright thoughts gifted friends had\r\nwritten for them. It has been truly said that Mr. Hutton has the faculty\r\nof bringing out in every one the best thoughts and kindest sentiments.\r\nOne does not need to read "A Boy I Knew" to understand him--the most\r\ngenerous, sweet-natured boy I ever knew, a good friend in all sorts of\r\nweather, who traces the footprints of love in the life of dogs as well\r\nas in that of his fellowmen.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hutton is a true and tried friend. Much that I hold sweetest, much\r\nthat I hold most precious, I owe to her. She has oftenest advised\r\nand helped me in my progress through college. When I find my work\r\nparticularly difficult and discouraging, she writes me letters that make\r\nme feel glad and brave; for she is one of those from whom we learn that\r\none painful duty fulfilled makes the next plainer and easier.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutton introduced me to many of his literary friends, greatest of\r\nwhom are Mr. William Dean Howells and Mark Twain. I also met Mr. Richard\r\nWatson Gilder and Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman. I also knew Mr. Charles\r\nDudley Warner, the most delightful of story-tellers and the most beloved\r\nfriend, whose sympathy was so broad that it may be truly said of him,\r\nhe loved all living things and his neighbour as himself. Once Mr. Warner\r\nbrought to see me the dear poet of the woodlands--Mr. John Burroughs.\r\nThey were all gentle and sympathetic and I felt the charm of their\r\nmanner as much as I had felt the brilliancy of their essays and poems.\r\nI could not keep pace with all these literary folk as they glanced from\r\nsubject to subject and entered into deep dispute, or made conversation\r\nsparkle with epigrams and happy witticisms. I was like little Ascanius,\r\nwho followed with unequal steps the heroic strides of Aeneas on his\r\nmarch toward mighty destinies. But they spoke many gracious words to me.\r\nMr. Gilder told me about his moonlight journeys across the vast desert\r\nto the Pyramids, and in a letter he wrote me he made his mark under his\r\nsignature deep in the paper so that I could feel it. This reminds me\r\nthat Dr. Hale used to give a personal touch to his letters to me by\r\npricking his signature in braille. I read from Mark Twain\'s lips one\r\nor two of his good stories. He has his own way of thinking, saying and\r\ndoing everything. I feel the twinkle of his eye in his handshake. Even\r\nwhile he utters his cynical wisdom in an indescribably droll voice, he\r\nmakes you feel that his heart is a tender Iliad of human sympathy.\r\n\r\nThere are a host of other interesting people I met in New York: Mrs.\r\nMary Mapes Dodge, the beloved editor of St. Nicholas, and Mrs. Riggs\r\n(Kate Douglas Wiggin), the sweet author of "Patsy." I received from them\r\ngifts that have the gentle concurrence of the heart, books containing\r\ntheir own thoughts, soul-illumined letters, and photographs that I love\r\nto have described again and again. But there is not space to mention\r\nall my friends, and indeed there are things about them hidden behind the\r\nwings of cherubim, things too sacred to set forth in cold print. It is\r\nwith hesitancy that I have spoken even of Mrs. Laurence Hutton.\r\n\r\nI shall mention only two other friends. One is Mrs. William Thaw, of\r\nPittsburgh, whom I have often visited in her home, Lyndhurst. She is\r\nalways doing something to make some one happy, and her generosity and\r\nwise counsel have never failed my teacher and me in all the years we\r\nhave known her.\r\n\r\nTo the other friend I am also deeply indebted. He is well known for the\r\npowerful hand with which he guides vast enterprises, and his wonderful\r\nabilities have gained for him the respect of all. Kind to every one, he\r\ngoes about doing good, silent and unseen. Again I touch upon the circle\r\nof honoured names I must not mention; but I would fain acknowledge his\r\ngenerosity and affectionate interest which make it possible for me to go\r\nto college.\r\n\r\nThus it is that my friends have made the story of my life. In a thousand\r\nways they have turned my limitations into beautiful privileges,\r\nand enabled me to walk serene and happy in the shadow cast by my\r\ndeprivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LETTERS(1887-1901)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LETTERS(1887-1901)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nHelen Keller\'s letters are important, not only as a supplementary\r\nstory of her life, but as a demonstration of her growth in\r\nthought and expression--the growth which in itself has made her\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThese letters are, however, not merely remarkable as the\r\nproductions of a deaf and blind girl, to be read with wonder and\r\ncuriosity; they are good letters almost from the first. The best\r\npassages are those in which she talks about herself, and gives\r\nher world in terms of her experience of it. Her views on the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes are not important, but most important\r\nare her accounts of what speech meant to her, of how she felt the\r\nstatues, the dogs, the chickens at the poultry show, and how she\r\nstood in the aisle of St. Bartholomew\'s and felt the organ\r\nrumble. Those are passages of which one would ask for more. The\r\nreason they are comparatively few is that all her life she has\r\nbeen trying to be "like other people," and so she too often\r\ndescribes things not as they appear to her, but as they appear to\r\none with eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nOne cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number\r\nof them. They are the exercises which have trained her to write.\r\nShe has lived at different times in different parts of the\r\ncountry, and so has been separated from most of her friends and\r\nrelatives. Of her friends, many have been distinguished people,\r\nto whom--not often, I think, at the sacrifice of spontaneity--she\r\nhas felt it necessary to write well. To them and to a few friends\r\nwith whom she is in closest sympathy she writes with intimate\r\nfrankness whatever she is thinking about. Her naive retelling of\r\na child\'s tale she has heard, like the story of "Little Jakey,"\r\nwhich she rehearses for Dr. Holmes and Bishop Brooks, is charming\r\nand her grave paraphrase of the day\'s lesson in geography or\r\nbotany, her parrot-like repetition of what she has heard, and her\r\nconscious display of new words, are delightful and instructive;\r\nfor they show not only what she was learning, but how, by putting\r\nit all into letters, she made the new knowledge and the new words\r\nher own.\r\n\r\nSo these selections from Miss Keller\'s correspondence are made\r\nwith two purposes--to show her development and to preserve the\r\nmost entertaining and significant passages from several hundred\r\nletters. Many of those written before 1892 were published in the\r\nreports of the Perkins Institution for the Blind. All letters up\r\nto that year are printed intact, for it is legitimate to be\r\ninterested in the degree of skill the child showed in writing,\r\neven to details of punctuation; so it is well to preserve a\r\nliteral integrity of reproduction. From the letters after the\r\nyear 1892 I have culled in the spirit of one making an anthology,\r\nchoosing the passages best in style and most important from the\r\npoint of view of biography. Where I have been able to collate the\r\noriginal letters I have preserved everything as Miss Keller wrote\r\nit, punctuation, spelling, and all. I have done nothing but\r\nselect and cut.\r\n\r\nThe letters are arranged in chronological order. One or two\r\nletters from Bishop Brooks, Dr. Holmes, and Whittier are put\r\nimmediately after the letters to which they are replies. Except\r\nfor two or three important letters of 1901, these selections\r\ncease with the year 1900. In that year Miss Keller entered\r\ncollege. Now that she is a grown woman, her mature letters should\r\nbe judged like those of any other person, and it seems best that\r\nno more of her correspondence be published unless she should\r\nbecome distinguished beyond the fact that she is the only\r\nwell-educated deaf and blind person in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  LETTERS (1887-1901)\r\n\r\n  Miss Sullivan began to teach Helen Keller on March 3rd, 1887.\r\n  Three months and a half after the first word was spelled into her\r\n  hand, she wrote in pencil this letter\r\n\r\n  TO HER COUSIN ANNA, MRS.

Two words are almost illegible,\r\n  and the angular print slants in every direction.\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER\r\n  [Huntsville, Alabama, July 12, 1887.]\r\n\r\n  Helen will write mother letter papa did give helen medicine\r\n  mildred will sit in swing mildred did kiss helen teacher did give\r\n  helen peach george is sick in bed george arm is hurt anna did\r\n  give helen lemonade dog did stand up.\r\n\r\n  conductor did punch ticket papa did give helen drink of water in\r\n  car\r\n\r\n  carlotta did give helen flowers anna will buy helen pretty new\r\n  hat helen will hug and kiss mother helen will come home\r\n  grandmother does love helen\r\n\r\n  good-by\r\n  [No signature.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  By the following September Helen shows improvement in fulness of\r\n  construction and more extended relations of thought.\r\n\r\n  TO THE BLIND GIRLS AT THE PERKINS INSTITUTION IN SOUTH BOSTON\r\n  [Tuscumbia, September, 1887.]\r\n\r\n  Helen will write little blind girls a letter Helen and teacher\r\n  will come to see little blind girls Helen and teacher will go in\r\n  steam car to boston Helen and blind girls will have fun blind\r\n  girls can talk on fingers Helen will see Mr anagnos Mr anagnos\r\n  will love and kiss Helen Helen will go to school with blind girls\r\n  Helen can read and count and spell and write like blind girls\r\n  mildred will not go to boston Mildred does cry prince and jumbo\r\n  will go to boston papa does shoot ducks with gun and ducks do\r\n  fall in water and jumbo and mamie do swim in water and bring\r\n  ducks out in mouth to papa Helen does play with dogs Helen does\r\n  ride on horseback with teacher Helen does give handee grass in\r\n  hand teacher does whip handee to go fast Helen is blind Helen\r\n  will put letter in envelope for blind girls     good-by\r\n  HELEN KELLER\r\n\r\n\r\n  A few weeks later her style is more nearly correct and freer in\r\n  movement. She improves in idiom, although she still omits\r\n  articles and uses the "did" construction for the simple past.\r\n  This is an idiom common among children.\r\n\r\n  TO THE BLIND GIRLS AT THE PERKINS INSTITUTION\r\n  [Tuscumbia, October 24, 1887.]\r\n\r\n  dear little blind girls\r\n\r\n  I will write you a letter I thank you for pretty desk I did write\r\n  to mother in memphis on it mother and mildred came home wednesday\r\n  mother brought me a pretty new dress and hat papa did go to\r\n  huntsville he brought me apples and candy I and teacher will come\r\n  to boston and see you nancy is my doll she does cry I do rock\r\n  nancy to sleep mildred is sick doctor will give her medicine to\r\n  make her well.

ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL\r\n  [Tuscumbia, November, 1887.]\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. Bell.\r\n  I am glad to write you a letter, Father will send you picture. I\r\n  and Father and aunt did go to see you in Washington. I did play\r\n  with your watch. I do love you. I saw doctor in Washington. He\r\n  looked at my eyes. I can read stories in my book.

Father will buy me lovely new watch. Cousin Anna gave me a\r\n  pretty doll. Her name is Allie.\r\n\r\n  Good-by,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  By the beginning of the next year her idioms are firmer. More\r\n  adjectives appear, including adjectives of colour. Although she\r\n  can have no sensuous knowledge of colour, she can use the words,\r\n  as we use most of our vocabulary, intellectually, with truth, not\r\n  to impression, but to fact. This letter is to a school-mate at\r\n  the Perkins Institution.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS SARAH TOMLINSON\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala. Jan. 2nd 1888.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sarah\r\n  I am happy to write to you this morning. I hope Mr. Anagnos is\r\n  coming to see me soon. I will go to Boston in June and I will buy\r\n  father gloves, and James nice collar, and Simpson cuffs. I saw\r\n  Miss Betty and her scholars. They had a pretty Christmas-tree,\r\n  and there were many pretty presents on it for little children. I\r\n  had a mug, and little bird and candy. I had many lovely things\r\n  for Christmas. Aunt gave me a trunk for Nancy and clothes. I went\r\n  to party with teacher and mother. We did dance and play and eat\r\n  nuts and candy and cakes and oranges and I did have fun with\r\n  little boys and girls. Mrs. Hopkins did send me lovely ring, I do\r\n  love her and little blind girls.\r\n\r\n  Men and boys do make carpets in mills. Wool grows on sheep. Men\r\n  do cut sheep\'s wool off with large shears, and send it to the\r\n  mill. Men and women do make wool cloth in mills.\r\n\r\n  Cotton grows on large stalks in fields.

I do love good girls.\r\n\r\n  Good-by\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The next two letters mention her visit in January to her\r\n  relatives in Memphis, Tennessee. She was taken to the cotton\r\n  exchange. When she felt the maps and blackboards she asked, "Do\r\n  men go to school?" She wrote on the blackboard the names of all\r\n  the gentlemen present. While at Memphis she went over one of the\r\n  large Mississippi steamers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO DR. EDWARD EVERETT HALE\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama, February 15th [1888].\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. Hale,\r\n  I am happy to write you a letter this morning.

Mr. Mayo has been to Duck Hill and he\r\n  brought sweet flowers home.\r\n\r\n  With much love and a kiss\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In this account of the picnic we get an illuminating glimpse of\r\n  Miss Sullivan\'s skill in teaching her pupil during play hours.\r\n  This was a day when the child\'s vocabulary grew.\r\n\r\n  TO MR. MICHAEL ANAGNOS\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala., May 3rd 1888.\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. Anagnos.--I am glad to write to you this morning,\r\n  because I love you very much. I was very happy to receive pretty\r\n  book and nice candy and two letters from you. I will come to see\r\n  you soon and will ask you many questions about countries and you\r\n  will love good child.\r\n\r\n  Mother is making me pretty new dresses to wear in Boston and I\r\n  will look lovely to see little girls and boys and you. Friday\r\n  teacher and I went to a picnic with little children. We played\r\n  games and ate dinner under the trees, and we found ferns and wild\r\n  flowers. I walked in the woods and learned names of many trees.\r\n  There are poplar and cedar and pine and oak and ash and hickory\r\n  and maple trees. They make a pleasant shade and the little birds\r\n  love to swing to and fro and sing sweetly up in the trees.\r\n  Rabbits hop and squirrels run and ugly snakes do crawl in the\r\n  woods. Geraniums and roses jasamines and japonicas are cultivated\r\n  flowers. I help mother and teacher water them every night before\r\n  supper.\r\n\r\n  Cousin Arthur made me a swing in the ash tree. Aunt Ev. has gone\r\n  to Memphis. Uncle Frank is here. He is picking strawberries for\r\n  dinner. Nancy is sick again, new teeth do make her ill. Adeline\r\n  is well and she can go to Cincinnati Monday with me. Aunt Ev.\r\n  will send me a boy doll, Harry will be Nancy\'s and Adeline\'s\r\n  brother. Wee sister is a good girl. I am tired now and I do want\r\n  to go down stairs. I send many kisses and hugs with letter.\r\n\r\n  Your darling child\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Toward the end of May Mrs. Keller, Helen, and Miss Sullivan\r\n  started for Boston. On the way they spent a few days in\r\n  Washington, where they saw Dr. Alexander Graham Bell and called\r\n  on President Cleveland. On May 26th they arrived in Boston and\r\n  went to the Perkins Institution; here Helen met the little blind\r\n  girls with whom she had corresponded the year before.\r\n\r\n  Early in July she went to Brewster, Massachusetts, and spent the\r\n  rest of the summer. Here occurred her first encounter with the\r\n  sea, of which she has since written.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS MARY C. MOORE\r\n  So. Boston, Mass. Sept. 1888\r\n\r\n  My dear Miss Moore\r\n  Are you very glad to receive a nice letter from your darling\r\n  little friend? I love you very dearly because you are my friend.\r\n  My precious little sister is quite well now. She likes to sit in\r\n  my little rocking-chair and put her kitty to sleep. Would you\r\n  like to see darling little Mildred? She is a very pretty baby.\r\n  Her eyes are very big and blue, and her cheeks are soft and round\r\n  and rosy and her hair is very bright and golden. She is very good\r\n  and sweet when she does not cry loud. Next summer Mildred will go\r\n  out in the garden with me and pick the big sweet strawberries and\r\n  then she will be very happy. I hope she will not eat too many of\r\n  the delicious fruit for they will make her very ill.\r\n\r\n  Sometime will you please come to Alabama and visit me? My uncle\r\n  James is going to buy me a very gentle pony and a pretty cart and\r\n  I shall be very happy to take you and Harry to ride. I hope Harry\r\n  will not be afraid of my pony. I think my father will buy me a\r\n  beautiful little brother some day. I shall be very gentle and\r\n  patient to my new little brother. When I visit many strange\r\n  countries my brother and Mildred will stay with grandmother\r\n  because they will be too small to see a great many people and I\r\n  think they would cry loud on the great rough ocean.\r\n\r\n  When Capt. Baker gets well he will take me in his big ship to\r\n  Africa. Then I shall see lions and tigers and monkeys. I will get\r\n  a baby lion and a white monkey and a mild bear to bring home. I\r\n  had a very pleasant time at Brewster. I went in bathing almost\r\n  every day and Carrie and Frank and little Helen and I had fun. We\r\n  splashed and jumped and waded in the deep water. I am not afraid\r\n  to float now. Can Harry float and swim? We came to Boston last\r\n  Thursday, and Mr. Anagnos was delighted to see me, and he hugged\r\n  and kissed me. The little girls are coming back to school next\r\n  Wednesday.\r\n\r\n  Will you please tell Harry to write me a very long letter soon?\r\n  When you come to Tuscumbia to see me I hope my father will have\r\n  many sweet apples and juicy peaches and fine pears and delicious\r\n  grapes and large water melons.\r\n\r\n  I hope you think about me and love me because I am a good little\r\n  child.\r\n\r\n  With much love and two kisses\r\n  From your little friend\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In this account of a visit to some friends, Helen\'s thought is\r\n  much what one would expect from an ordinary child of eight,\r\n  except perhaps her naive satisfaction in the boldness of the\r\n  young gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER\r\n  So. Boston, Mass, Sept. 24th [1888].\r\n\r\n  My dear Mother,\r\n  I think you will be very glad to know all about my visit to West\r\n  Newton. Teacher and I had a lovely time with many kind friends.\r\n  West Newton is not far from Boston and we went there in the steam\r\n  cars very quickly.\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Freeman and Carrie and Ethel and Frank and Helen came to\r\n  station to meet us in a huge carriage. I was delighted to see my\r\n  dear little friends and I hugged and kissed them. Then we rode\r\n  for a long time to see all the beautiful things in West Newton.\r\n  Many very handsome houses and large soft green lawns around them\r\n  and trees and bright flowers and fountains. The horse\'s name was\r\n  Prince and he was gentle and liked to trot very fast. When we\r\n  went home we saw eight rabbits and two fat puppies, and a nice\r\n  little white pony, and two wee kittens and a pretty curly dog\r\n  named Don. Pony\'s name was Mollie and I had a nice ride on her\r\n  back; I was not afraid, I hope my uncle will get me a dear little\r\n  pony and a little cart very soon.\r\n\r\n  Clifton did not kiss me because he does not like to kiss little\r\n  girls. He is shy. I am very glad that Frank and Clarence and\r\n  Robbie and Eddie and Charles and George were not very shy. I\r\n  played with many little girls and we had fun. I rode on Carrie\'s\r\n  tricicle and picked flowers and ate fruit and hopped and skipped\r\n  and danced and went to ride. Many ladies and gentlemen came to\r\n  see us. Lucy and Dora and Charles were born in China. I was born\r\n  in America, and Mr. Anagnos was born in Greece. Mr. Drew says\r\n  little girls in China cannot talk on their fingers but I think\r\n  when I go to China I will teach them. Chinese nurse came to see\r\n  me, her name was Asu. She showed me a tiny atze that very rich\r\n  ladies in China wear because their feet never grow large. Amah\r\n  means a nurse. We came home in horse cars because it was Sunday\r\n  and steam cars do not go often on Sunday. Conductors and\r\n  engineers do get very tired and go home to rest. I saw little\r\n  Willie Swan in the car and he gave me a juicy pear. He was six\r\n  years old. What did I do when I was six years old? Will you\r\n  please ask my father to come to train to meet teacher and me? I\r\n  am very sorry that Eva and Bessie are sick. I hope I can have a\r\n  nice party my birthday, and I do want Carrie and Ethel and Frank\r\n  and Helen to come to Alabama to visit me. Will Mildred sleep with\r\n  me when I come home.\r\n\r\n  With much love and thousand kisses.\r\n  From your dear little daughter.\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Her visit to Plymouth was in July. This letter, written three\r\n  months later, shows how well she remembered her first lesson in\r\n  history.\r\n\r\n  TO MR. MORRISON HEADY\r\n  South Boston, Mass. October 1st, 1888.\r\n\r\n  My dear uncle Morrie,--I think you will be very glad to receive a\r\n  letter from your dear little friend Helen. I am very happy to\r\n  write to you because I think of you and love you. I read pretty\r\n  stories in the book you sent me, about Charles and his boat, and\r\n  Arthur and his dream, and Rosa and the sheep.\r\n\r\n  I have been in a large boat. It was like a ship. Mother and\r\n  teacher and Mrs. Hopkins and Mr. Anagnos and Mr. Rodocanachi and\r\n  many other friends went to Plymouth to see many old things. I\r\n  will tell you a little story about Plymouth.\r\n\r\n  Many years ago there lived in England many good people, but the\r\n  king and his friends were not kind and gentle and patient with\r\n  good people, because the king did not like to have the people\r\n  disobey him. People did not like to go to church with the king;\r\n  but they did like to build very nice little churches for\r\n  themselves.\r\n\r\n  The king was very angry with the people and they were sorry and\r\n  they said, we will go away to a strange country to live and leave\r\n  very dear home and friends and naughty king. So, they put all\r\n  their things into big boxes, and said, Good-bye. I am sorry for\r\n  them because they cried much. When they went to Holland they did\r\n  not know anyone; and they could not know what the people were\r\n  talking about because they did not know Dutch. But soon they\r\n  learned some Dutch words; but they loved their own language and\r\n  they did not want little boys and girls to forget it and learn to\r\n  talk funny Dutch. So they said, We must go to a new country far\r\n  away and build schools and houses and churches and make new\r\n  cities. So they put all their things in boxes and said, Good-bye\r\n  to their new friends and sailed away in a large boat to find a\r\n  new country. Poor people were not happy for their hearts were\r\n  full of sad thoughts because they did not know much about\r\n  America. I think little children must have been afraid of a great\r\n  ocean for it is very strong and it makes a large boat rock and\r\n  then the little children would fall down and hurt their heads.\r\n  After they had been many weeks on the deep ocean where they could\r\n  not see trees or flowers or grass, but just water and the\r\n  beautiful sky, for ships could not sail quickly then because men\r\n  did not know about engines and steam. One day a dear little\r\n  baby-boy was born. His name was Peregrine White. I am very sorry\r\n  that poor little Peregrine is dead now. Every day the people went\r\n  upon deck to look out for land. One day there was a great shout\r\n  on the ship for the people saw the land and they were full of joy\r\n  because they had reached a new country safely. Little girls and\r\n  boys jumped and clapped their hands. They were all glad when they\r\n  stepped upon a huge rock. I did see the rock in Plymouth and a\r\n  little ship like the Mayflower and the cradle that dear little\r\n  Peregrine slept in and many old things that came in the\r\n  Mayflower. Would you like to visit Plymouth some time and see\r\n  many old things.\r\n\r\n  Now I am very tired and I will rest.\r\n\r\n  With much love and many kisses, from your little friend.\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The foreign words in these two letters, the first of which was\r\n  written during a visit to the kindergarten for the blind, she had\r\n  been told months before, and had stowed them away in her memory.\r\n  She assimilated words and practised with them, sometimes using\r\n  them intelligently, sometimes repeating them in a parrot-like\r\n  fashion. Even when she did not fully understand words or ideas,\r\n  she liked to set them down as though she did. It was in this way\r\n  that she learned to use correctly words of sound and vision which\r\n  express ideas outside of her experience. "Edith" is Edith Thomas.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. MICHAEL ANAGNOS\r\n  Roxbury, Mass. Oct. 17th, 1888.\r\n\r\n  Mon cher Monsieur Anagnos,\r\n\r\n  I am sitting by the window and the beautiful sun is shining on me\r\n  Teacher and I came to the kindergarten yesterday. There are\r\n  twenty seven little children here and they are all blind. I am\r\n  sorry because they cannot see much. Sometime will they have very\r\n  well eyes? Poor Edith is blind and deaf and dumb. Are you very\r\n  sad for Edith and me? Soon I shall go home to see my mother and\r\n  my father and my dear good and sweet little sister. I hope you\r\n  will come to Alabama to visit me and I will take you to ride in\r\n  my little cart and I think you will like to see me on my dear\r\n  little pony\'s back. I shall wear my lovely cap and my new riding\r\n  dress. If the sun shines brightly I will take you to see Leila\r\n  and Eva and Bessie. When I am thirteen years old I am going to\r\n  travel in many strange and beautiful countries. I shall climb\r\n  very high mountains in Norway and see much ice and snow. I hope I\r\n  will not fall and hurt my head I shall visit little Lord\r\n  Fauntleroy in England and he will be glad to show me his grand\r\n  and very ancient castle. And we will run with the deer and feed\r\n  the rabbits and catch the squirrels. I shall not be afraid of\r\n  Fauntleroy\'s great dog Dougal. I hope Fauntleroy take me to see a\r\n  very kind queen. When I go to France I will take French. A little\r\n  French boy will say, Parlez-vous Francais? and I will say, Oui,\r\n  Monsieur, vous avez un joli chapeau. Donnez moi un baiser. I hope\r\n  you will go with me to Athens to see the maid of Athens. She was\r\n  very lovely lady and I will talk Greek to her. I will say, se\r\n  agapo and, pos echete and I think she will say, kalos, and then I\r\n  will say chaere. Will you please come to see me soon and take me\r\n  to the theater? When you come I will say, Kale emera, and when\r\n  you go home I will say, Kale nykta. Now I am too tired to write\r\n  more. Je vous aime. Au revoir\r\n\r\n  From your darling little friend\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS EVELINA H. KELLER\r\n  [So. Boston, Mass. October 29, 1888.]\r\n\r\n  My dearest Aunt,--I am coming home very soon and I think you and\r\n  every one will be very glad to see my teacher and me. I am very\r\n  happy because I have learned much about many things. I am\r\n  studying French and German and Latin and Greek. Se agapo is\r\n  Greek, and it means I love thee. J\'ai une bonne petite soeur is\r\n  French, and it means I have a good little sister. Nous avons un\r\n  bon pere et une bonne mere means, we have a good father and a\r\n  good mother. Puer is boy in Latin, and Mutter is mother in\r\n  German. I will teach Mildred many languages when I come home.\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. SOPHIA C. HOPKINS\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala. Dec. 11th, 1888.\r\n\r\n  My dear Mrs. Hopkins:--\r\n  I have just fed my dear little pigeon. My brother Simpson gave it\r\n  to me last Sunday. I named it Annie, for my teacher. My puppy has\r\n  had his supper and gone to bed. My rabbits are sleeping, too; and\r\n  very soon I shall go to bed. Teacher is writing letters to her\r\n  friends. Mother and father and their friends have gone to see a\r\n  huge furnace. The furnace is to make iron. The iron ore is found\r\n  in the ground; but it cannot be used until it has been brought to\r\n  the furnace and melted, and all the dirt taken out, and just the\r\n  pure iron left. Then it is all ready to be manufactured into\r\n  engines, stoves, kettles and many other things.\r\n\r\n  Coal is found in the ground, too. Many years ago, before people\r\n  came to live on the earth, great trees and tall grasses and huge\r\n  ferns and all the beautiful flowers cover the earth. When the\r\n  leaves and the trees fell, the water and the soil covered them;\r\n  and then more trees grew and fell also, and were buried under\r\n  water and soil. After they had all been pressed together for many\r\n  thousands of years, the wood grew very hard, like rock, and then\r\n  it was all ready for people to burn. Can you see leaves and ferns\r\n  and bark on the coal? Men go down into the ground and dig out the\r\n  coal, and steam-cars take it to the large cities, and sell it to\r\n  people to burn, to make them warm and happy when it is cold out\r\n  of doors.\r\n\r\n  Are you very lonely and sad now? I hope you will come to see me\r\n  soon, and stay a long time.\r\n\r\n  With much love from your little friend\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS DELLA BENNETT\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala., Jan. 29, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My dear Miss Bennett:--I am delighted to write to you this\r\n  morning. We have just eaten our breakfast. Mildred is running\r\n  about downstairs. I have been reading in my book about\r\n  astronomers. Astronomer comes from the Latin word astra, which\r\n  means stars; and astronomers are men who study the stars, and\r\n  tell us about them. When we are sleeping quietly in our beds,\r\n  they are watching the beautiful sky through the telescope. A\r\n  telescope is like a very strong eye. The stars are so far away\r\n  that people cannot tell much about them, without very excellent\r\n  instruments. Do you like to look out of your window, and see\r\n  little stars? Teacher says she can see Venus from our window, and\r\n  it is a large and beautiful star. The stars are called the\r\n  earth\'s brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\n  There are a great many instruments besides those which the\r\n  astronomers use. A knife is an instrument to cut with. I think\r\n  the bell is an instrument, too. I will tell you what I know about\r\n  bells.\r\n\r\n  Some bells are musical and others are unmusical. Some are very\r\n  tiny and some are very large. I saw a very large bell at\r\n  Wellesley. It came from Japan. Bells are used for many purposes.\r\n  They tell us when breakfast is ready, when to go to school, when\r\n  it is time for church, and when there is a fire. They tell people\r\n  when to go to work, and when to go home and rest. The engine-bell\r\n  tells the passengers that they are coming to a station, and it\r\n  tells the people to keep out of the way. Sometimes very terrible\r\n  accidents happen, and many people are burned and drowned and\r\n  injured. The other day I broke my doll\'s head off; but that was\r\n  not a dreadful accident, because dolls do not live and feel, like\r\n  people. My little pigeons are well, and so is my little bird. I\r\n  would like to have some clay. Teacher says it is time for me to\r\n  study now. Good-bye.\r\n  With much love, and many kisses,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO DR. EDWARD EVERETT HALE\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama, February 21st, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My dear Mr. Hale,\r\n  I am very much afraid that you are thinking in your mind that\r\n  little Helen has forgotten all about you and her dear cousins.\r\n  But I think you will be delighted to receive this letter because\r\n  then you will know that I of[ten] think about you and I love you\r\n  dearly for you are my dear cousin. I have been at home a great\r\n  many weeks now. It made me feel very sad to leave Boston and I\r\n  missed all of my friends greatly, but of course I was glad to get\r\n  back to my lovely home once more. My darling little sister is\r\n  growing very fast. Sometimes she tries to spell very short words\r\n  on her small [fingers] but she is too young to remember hard\r\n  words. When she is older I will teach her many things if she is\r\n  patient and obedient. My teacher says, if children learn to be\r\n  patient and gentle while they are little, that when they grow to\r\n  be young ladies and gentlemen they will not forget to be kind and\r\n  loving and brave. I hope I shall be courageous always. A little\r\n  girl in a story was not courageous. She thought she saw little\r\n  elves with tall pointed [hats] peeping from between the bushes\r\n  and dancing down the long alleys, and the poor little girl was\r\n  terrified. Did you have a pleasant Christmas? I had many lovely\r\n  presents given to me. The other day I had a fine party. All of my\r\n  dear little friends came to see me. We played games, and ate\r\n  ice-cream and cake and fruit. Then we had great fun. The sun is\r\n  shining brightly to-day and I hope we shall go to ride if the\r\n  roads are dry. In a few days the beautiful spring will be here. I\r\n  am very glad because I love the warm sunshine and the fragrant\r\n  flowers. I think Flowers grow to make people happy and good. I\r\n  have four dolls now. Cedric is my little boy, he is named for\r\n  Lord Fauntleroy. He has big brown eyes and long golden hair and\r\n  pretty round cheeks. Ida is my baby. A lady brought her to me\r\n  from Paris. She can drink milk like a real baby. Lucy is a fine\r\n  young lady. She has on a dainty lace dress and satin slippers.\r\n  Poor old Nancy is growing old and very feeble. She is almost an\r\n  invalid. I have two tame pigeons and a tiny canary bird. Jumbo is\r\n  very strong and faithful. He will not let anything harm us at\r\n  night. I go to school every day I am studying reading, writing,\r\n  arithmetic, geography and language. My Mother and teacher send\r\n  you and Mrs. Hale their kind greetings and Mildred sends you a\r\n  kiss.\r\n  With much love and kisses, from your\r\n  Affectionate cousin\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  During the winter Miss Sullivan and her pupil were working at\r\n  Helen\'s home in Tuscumbia, and to good purpose, for by spring\r\n  Helen had learned to write idiomatic English. After May, 1889, I\r\n  find almost no inaccuracies, except some evident slips of the\r\n  pencil. She uses words precisely and makes easy, fluent\r\n  sentences.\r\n\r\n  TO MR. MICHAEL ANAGNOS\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala., May 18, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Mr. Anagnos:--You cannot imagine how delighted I was to\r\n  receive a letter from you last evening. I am very sorry that you\r\n  are going so far away. We shall miss you very, very much. I would\r\n  love to visit many beautiful cities with you. When I was in\r\n  Huntsville I saw Dr. Bryson, and he told me that he had been to\r\n  Rome and Athens and Paris and London. He had climbed the high\r\n  mountains in Switzerland and visited beautiful churches in Italy\r\n  and France, and he saw a great many ancient castles. I hope you\r\n  will please write to me from all the cities you visit. When you\r\n  go to Holland please give my love to the lovely princess\r\n  Wilhelmina. She is a dear little girl, and when she is old enough\r\n  she will be the queen of Holland. If you go to Roumania please\r\n  ask the good queen Elizabeth about her little invalid brother,\r\n  and tell her that I am very sorry that her darling little girl\r\n  died. I should like to send a kiss to Vittorio, the little prince\r\n  of Naples, but teacher says she is afraid you will not remember\r\n  so many messages. When I am thirteen years old I shall visit them\r\n  all myself.\r\n\r\n  I thank you very much for the beautiful story about Lord\r\n  Fauntleroy, and so does teacher.\r\n\r\n  I am so glad that Eva is coming to stay with me this summer. We\r\n  will have fine times together. Give Howard my love, and tell him\r\n  to answer my letter. Thursday we had a picnic. It was very\r\n  pleasant out in the shady woods, and we all enjoyed the picnic\r\n  very much.\r\n\r\n  Mildred is out in the yard playing, and mother is picking the\r\n  delicious strawberries. Father and Uncle Frank are down town.\r\n  Simpson is coming home soon. Mildred and I had our pictures taken\r\n  while we were in Huntsville. I will send you one.\r\n\r\n  The roses have been beautiful. Mother has a great many fine\r\n  roses. The La France and the Lamarque are the most fragrant; but\r\n  the Marechal Neil, Solfaterre, Jacqueminot, Nipheots, Etoile de\r\n  Lyon, Papa Gontier, Gabrielle Drevet and the Perle des Jardines\r\n  are all lovely roses.\r\n\r\n  Please give the little boys and girls my love. I think of them\r\n  every day and I love them dearly in my heart. When you come home\r\n  from Europe I hope you will be all well and very happy to get\r\n  home again. Do not forget to give my love to Miss Calliope\r\n  Kehayia and Mr. Francis Demetrios Kalopothakes.\r\n  Lovingly, your little friend,\r\n  HELEN ADAMS KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Like a good many of Helen Keller\'s early letters, this to her\r\n  French teacher is her re-phrasing of a story. It shows how much\r\n  the gift of writing is, in the early stages of its development,\r\n  the gift of mimicry.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS FANNIE S. MARRETT\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala., May 17, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Miss Marrett--I am thinking about a dear little girl, who\r\n  wept very hard. She wept because her brother teased her very\r\n  much. I will tell you what he did, and I think you will feel very\r\n  sorry for the little child. She had a most beautiful doll given\r\n  her. Oh, it was a lovely and delicate doll! but the little girl\'s\r\n  brother, a tall lad, had taken the doll, and set it up in a high\r\n  tree in the garden, and had run away. The little girl could not\r\n  reach the doll, and could not help it down, and therefore she\r\n  cried. The doll cried, too, and stretched out its arms from among\r\n  the green branches, and looked distressed. Soon the dismal night\r\n  would come--and was the doll to sit up in the tree all night, and\r\n  by herself? The little girl could not endure that thought. "I\r\n  will stay with you," said she to the doll, although she was not\r\n  at all courageous. Already she began to see quite plainly the\r\n  little elves in their tall pointed hats, dancing down the dusky\r\n  alleys, and peeping from between the bushes, and they seemed to\r\n  come nearer and nearer; and she stretched her hands up towards\r\n  the tree in which the doll sat and they laughed, and pointed\r\n  their fingers at her. How terrified was the little girl; but if\r\n  one has not done anything wrong, these strange little elves\r\n  cannot harm one. "Have I done anything wrong? Ah, yes!" said the\r\n  little girl. "I have laughed at the poor duck, with the red rag\r\n  tied round its leg. It hobbled, and that made me laugh; but it is\r\n  wrong to laugh at the poor animals!"\r\n\r\n  Is it not a pitiful story? I hope the father punished the naughty\r\n  little boy. Shall you be very glad to see my teacher next\r\n  Thursday? She is going home to rest, but she will come back to me\r\n  next autumn.\r\n  Lovingly, your little friend,\r\n  HELEN ADAMS KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS MARY E. RILEY\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala., May 27, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Miss Riley:--I wish you were here in the warm, sunny\r\n  south today. Little sister and I would take you out into the\r\n  garden, and pick the delicious raspberries and a few strawberries\r\n  for you. How would you like that? The strawberries are nearly all\r\n  gone. In the evening, when it is cool and pleasant, we would walk\r\n  in the yard, and catch the grasshoppers and butterflies. We would\r\n  talk about the birds and flowers and grass and Jumbo and Pearl.\r\n  If you liked, we would run and jump and hop and dance, and be\r\n  very happy. I think you would enjoy hearing the mocking-birds\r\n  sing. One sits on the twig of a tree, just beneath our window,\r\n  and he fills the air with his glad songs. But I am afraid you\r\n  cannot come to Tuscumbia; so I will write to you, and send you a\r\n  sweet kiss and my love. How is Dick? Daisy is happy, but she\r\n  would be happy ever if she had a little mate. My little children\r\n  are all well except Nancy, and she is quite feeble. My\r\n  grandmother and aunt Corinne are here. Grandmother is going to\r\n  make me two new dresses. Give my love to all the little girls,\r\n  and tell them that Helen loves them very, very much. Eva sends\r\n  love to all.\r\n\r\n  With much love and many kisses, from your affectionate little\r\n  friend,\r\n  HELEN ADAMS KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  During the summer Miss Sullivan was away from Helen for three\r\n  months and a half, the first separation of teacher and pupil.\r\n  Only once afterward in fifteen years was their constant\r\n  companionship broken for more than a few days at a time.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS ANNE MANSFIELD SULLIVAN\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala., August 7, 1889.\r\n\r\n  Dearest Teacher--I am very glad to write to you this evening, for\r\n  I have been thinking much about you all day. I am sitting on the\r\n  piazza, and my little white pigeon is perched on the back of my\r\n  chair, watching me write. Her little brown mate has flown away\r\n  with the other birds; but Annie is not sad, for she likes to stay\r\n  with me. Fauntleroy is asleep upstairs, and Nancy is putting Lucy\r\n  to bed. Perhaps the mocking bird is singing them to sleep. All\r\n  the beautiful flowers are in bloom now. The air is sweet with the\r\n  perfume of jasmines, heliotropes and roses. It is getting warm\r\n  here now, so father is going to take us to the Quarry on the 20th\r\n  of August. I think we shall have a beautiful time out in the\r\n  cool, pleasant woods. I will write and tell you all the pleasant\r\n  things we do. I am so glad that Lester and Henry are good little\r\n  infants. Give them many sweet kisses for me.\r\n\r\n  What was the name of the little boy who fell in love with the\r\n  beautiful star? Eva has been telling me a story about a lovely\r\n  little girl named Heidi. Will you please send it to me? I shall\r\n  be delighted to have a typewriter.\r\n\r\n  Little Arthur is growing very fast. He has on short dresses now.\r\n  Cousin Leila thinks he will walk in a little while. Then I will\r\n  take his soft chubby hand in mine, and go out in the bright\r\n  sunshine with him. He will pull the largest roses, and chase the\r\n  gayest butterflies. I will take very good care of him, and not\r\n  let him fall and hurt himself. Father and some other gentlemen\r\n  went hunting yesterday. Father killed thirty-eight birds. We had\r\n  some of them for supper, and they were very nice. Last Monday\r\n  Simpson shot a pretty crane. The crane is a large and strong\r\n  bird. His wings are as long as my arm, and his bill is as long as\r\n  my foot. He eats little fishes, and other small animals. Father\r\n  says he can fly nearly all day without stopping.\r\n\r\n  Mildred is the dearest and sweetest little maiden in the world.\r\n  She is very roguish, too. Sometimes, when mother does not know\r\n  it, she goes out into the vineyard, and gets her apron full of\r\n  delicious grapes. I think she would like to put her two soft arms\r\n  around your neck and hug you.\r\n\r\n  Sunday I went to church. I love to go to church, because I like\r\n  to see my friends.\r\n\r\n  A gentleman gave me a beautiful card. It was a picture of a mill,\r\n  near a beautiful brook. There was a boat floating on the water,\r\n  and the fragrant lilies were growing all around the boat. Not far\r\n  from the mill there was an old house, with many trees growing\r\n  close to it. There were eight pigeons on the roof of the house,\r\n  and a great dog on the step. Pearl is a very proud mother-dog\r\n  now. She has eight puppies, and she thinks there never were such\r\n  fine puppies as hers.\r\n\r\n  I read in my books every day. I love them very, very, very much.\r\n  I do want you to come back to me soon. I miss you so very, very\r\n  much. I cannot know about many things, when my dear teacher is\r\n  not here. I send you five thousand kisses, and more love than I\r\n  can tell. I send Mrs. H. much love and a kiss.\r\n  From your affectionate little pupil,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the fall Helen and Miss Sullivan returned to Perkins\r\n  Institution at South Boston.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS MILDRED KELLER\r\n  South Boston, Oct. 24, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My Precious Little Sister:--Good morning. I am going to send you\r\n  a birthday gift with this letter. I hope it will please you very\r\n  much, because it makes me happy to send it. The dress is blue\r\n  like your eyes, and candy is sweet just like your dear little\r\n  self. I think mother will be glad to make the dress for you, and\r\n  when you wear it you will look as pretty as a rose. The\r\n  picture-book will tell you all about many strange and wild\r\n  animals. You must not be afraid of them. They cannot come out of\r\n  the picture to harm you.\r\n\r\n  I go to school every day, and I learn many new things. At eight I\r\n  study arithmetic. I like that. At nine I go to the gymnasium with\r\n  the little girls and we have great fun. I wish you could be here\r\n  to play three little squirrels, and two gentle doves, and to make\r\n  a pretty nest for a dear little robin. The mocking bird does not\r\n  live in the cold north. At ten I study about the earth on which\r\n  we all live. At eleven I talk with teacher and at twelve I study\r\n  zoology. I do not know what I shall do in the afternoon yet.\r\n\r\n  Now, my darling little Mildred, good bye. Give father and mother\r\n  a great deal of love and many hugs and kisses for me. Teacher\r\n  sends her love too.\r\n  From your loving sister,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. WILLIAM WADE\r\n  South Boston, Mass., Nov. 20, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Mr. Wade:--I have just received a letter from my mother,\r\n  telling me that the beautiful mastiff puppy you sent me had\r\n  arrived in Tuscumbia safely. Thank you very much for the nice\r\n  gift. I am very sorry that I was not at home to welcome her; but\r\n  my mother and my baby sister will be very kind to her while her\r\n  mistress is away. I hope she is not lonely and unhappy. I think\r\n  puppies can feel very home-sick, as well as little girls. I\r\n  should like to call her Lioness, for your dog. May I? I hope she\r\n  will be very faithful,--and brave, too.\r\n\r\n  I am studying in Boston, with my dear teacher. I learn a great\r\n  many new and wonderful things. I study about the earth, and the\r\n  animals, and I like arithmetic exceedingly. I learn many new\r\n  words, too. EXCEEDINGLY is one that I learned yesterday. When I\r\n  see Lioness I will tell her many things which will surprise her\r\n  greatly. I think she will laugh when I tell her she is a\r\n  vertebrate, a mammal, a quadruped; and I shall be very sorry to\r\n  tell her that she belongs to the order Carnivora. I study French,\r\n  too. When I talk French to Lioness I will call her mon beau\r\n  chien. Please tell Lion that I will take good care of Lioness. I\r\n  shall be happy to have a letter from you when you like to write\r\n  to me.\r\n\r\n  From your loving little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n  P.S. I am studying at the Institution for the Blind.\r\n\r\n  H. A. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This letter is indorsed in Whittier\'s hand, "Helen A.\r\n  Keller--deaf dumb and blind--aged nine years." "Browns" is a\r\n  lapse of the pencil for "brown eyes."\r\n\r\n  TO JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER\r\n  Inst. for the Blind, So. Boston, Mass.,\r\n  Nov. 27, 1889.\r\n\r\n  Dear Poet,\r\n  I think you will be surprised to receive a letter from a little\r\n  girl whom you do not know, but I thought you would be glad to\r\n  hear that your beautiful poems make me very happy. Yesterday I\r\n  read "In School Days" and "My Playmate," and I enjoyed them\r\n  greatly. I was very sorry that the poor little girl with the\r\n  browns and the "tangled golden curls" died. It is very pleasant\r\n  to live here in our beautiful world. I cannot see the lovely\r\n  things with my eyes, but my mind can see them all, and so I am\r\n  joyful all the day long.\r\n\r\n  When I walk out in my garden I cannot see the beautiful flowers\r\n  but I know that they are all around me; for is not the air sweet\r\n  with their fragrance? I know too that the tiny lily-bells are\r\n  whispering pretty secrets to their companions else they would not\r\n  look so happy. I love you very dearly, because you have taught me\r\n  so many lovely things about flowers, and birds, and people. Now I\r\n  must say, good-bye. I hope [you] will enjoy the Thanksgiving very\r\n  much.\r\n\r\n  From your loving little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n  To Mr. John Greenleaf Whittier.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whittier\'s reply, to which there is a reference in the following\r\n  letter, has been lost.\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER\r\n  South Boston, Mass., Dec. 3, 1889.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Mother:--Your little daughter is very happy to write to\r\n  you this beautiful morning. It is cold and rainy here to-day.\r\n  Yesterday the Countess of Meath came again to see me. She gave me\r\n  a beautiful bunch of violets. Her little girls are named Violet\r\n  and May. The Earl said he should be delighted to visit Tuscumbia\r\n  the next time he comes to America. Lady Meath said she would like\r\n  to see your flowers, and hear the mocking-birds sing. When I\r\n  visit England they want me to come to see them, and stay a few\r\n  weeks. They will take me to see the Queen.\r\n\r\n  I had a lovely letter from the poet Whittier. He loves me. Mr.\r\n  Wade wants teacher and me to come and see him next spring. May we\r\n  go? He said you must feed Lioness from your hand, because she\r\n  will be more gentle if she does not eat with other dogs.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Wilson came to call on us one Thursday. I was delighted to\r\n  receive the flowers from home. They came while we were eating\r\n  breakfast, and my friends enjoyed them with me. We had a very\r\n  nice dinner on Thanksgiving day,--turkey and plum-pudding. Last\r\n  week I visited a beautiful art store. I saw a great many statues,\r\n  and the gentleman gave me an angel.\r\n\r\n  Sunday I went to church on board a great warship. After the\r\n  services were over the soldier-sailors showed us around. There\r\n  were four hundred and sixty sailors. They were very kind to me.\r\n  One carried me in his arms so that my feet would not touch the\r\n  water. They wore blue uniforms and queer little caps. There was a\r\n  terrible fire Thursday. Many stores were burned, and four men\r\n  were killed. I am very sorry for them. Tell father, please, to\r\n  write to me. How is dear little sister? Give her many kisses for\r\n  me. Now I must close. With much love, from your darling child,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER\r\n  So. Boston, Mass., Dec. 24, 1889\r\n\r\n  My dear Mother,\r\n  Yesterday I sent you a little Christmas box. I am very sorry that\r\n  I could not send it before so that you would receive it tomorrow,\r\n  but I could not finish the watch-case any sooner. I made all of\r\n  the gifts myself, excepting father\'s handkerchief. I wish I could\r\n  have made father a gift too, but I did not have sufficient time.\r\n  I hope you will like your watch-case, for it made me very happy\r\n  to make it for you. You must keep your lovely new montre in it.\r\n  If it is too warm in Tuscumbia for little sister to wear her\r\n  pretty mittens, she can keep them because her sister made them\r\n  for her. I imagine she will have fun with the little toy man.\r\n  Tell her to shake him, and then he will blow his trumpet. I thank\r\n  my dear kind father for sending me some money, to buy gifts for\r\n  my friends. I love to make everybody happy. I should like to be\r\n  at home on Christmas day. We would be very happy together. I\r\n  think of my beautiful home every day. Please do not forget to\r\n  send me some pretty presents to hang on my tree. I am going to\r\n  have a Christmas tree, in the parlor and teacher will hang all of\r\n  my gifts upon it. It will be a funny tree. All of the girls have\r\n  gone home to spend Christmas. Teacher and I are the only babies\r\n  left for Mrs. Hopkins to care for. Teacher has been sick in bed\r\n  for many days. Her throat was very sore and the doctor thought\r\n  she would have to go away to the hospital, but she is better now.\r\n  I have not been sick at all. The little girls are well too.\r\n  Friday I am going to spend the day with my little friends Carrie,\r\n  Ethel, Frank and Helen Freeman. We will have great fun I am sure.\r\n\r\n  Mr. and Miss Endicott came to see me, and I went to ride in the\r\n  carriage. They are going to give me a lovely present, but I\r\n  cannot guess what it will be. Sammy has a dear new brother. He is\r\n  very soft and delicate yet. Mr. Anagnos is in Athens now. He is\r\n  delighted because I am here. Now I must say, good-bye. I hope I\r\n  have written my letter nicely, but it is very difficult to write\r\n  on this paper and teacher is not here to give me better. Give\r\n  many kisses to little sister and much love to all. Lovingly\r\n  HELEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO DR. EDWARD EVERETT HALE\r\n  South Boston, Jan. 8, 1890.\r\n\r\n  My dear Mr. Hale:\r\n  The beautiful shells came last night. I thank you very much for\r\n  them. I shall always keep them, and it will make me very happy to\r\n  think that you found them, on that far away island, from which\r\n  Columbus sailed to discover our dear country. When I am eleven\r\n  years old it will be four hundred years since he started with the\r\n  three small ships to cross the great strange ocean. He was very\r\n  brave. The little girls were delighted to see the lovely shells.\r\n  I told them all I knew about them. Are you very glad that you\r\n  could make so many happy? I am. I should be very happy to come\r\n  and teach you the Braille sometime, if you have time to learn,\r\n  but I am afraid you are too busy. A few days ago I received a\r\n  little box of English violets from Lady Meath. The flowers were\r\n  wilted, but the kind thought which came with them was as sweet\r\n  and as fresh as newly pulled violets.\r\n\r\n  With loving greeting to the little cousins, and Mrs. Hale and a\r\n  sweet kiss for yourself,\r\n  From your little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This, the first of Helen\'s letters to Dr. Holmes, written soon\r\n  after a visit to him, he published in "Over the Teacups."\r\n  [Atlantic Monthly, May, 1890]\r\n\r\n  TO DR. OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES\r\n  South Boston, Mass., March 1, 1890.\r\n\r\n  Dear, Kind Poet:--I have thought of you many times since that\r\n  bright Sunday when I bade you good-bye; and I am going to write\r\n  you a letter, because I love you. I am sorry that you have no\r\n  little children to play with you sometimes; but I think you are\r\n  very happy with your books, and your many, many friends. On\r\n  Washington\'s birthday a great many people came here to see the\r\n  blind children; and I read for them from your poems, and showed\r\n  them some beautiful shells, which came from a little island near\r\n  Palos.\r\n\r\n  I am reading a very sad story, called "Little Jakey." Jakey was\r\n  the sweetest little fellow you can imagine, but he was poor and\r\n  blind. I used to think--when I was small, and before I could\r\n  read--that everybody was always happy, and at first it made me\r\n  very sad to know about pain and great sorrow; but now I know that\r\n  we could never learn to be brave and patient, if there were only\r\n  joy in the world.\r\n\r\n  I am studying about insects in zoology, and I have learned many\r\n  things about butterflies. They do not make honey for us, like the\r\n  bees, but many of them are as beautiful as the flowers they light\r\n  upon, and they always delight the hearts of little children. They\r\n  live a gay life, flitting from flower to flower, sipping the\r\n  drops of honeydew, without a thought for the morrow. They are\r\n  just like little boys and girls when they forget books and\r\n  studies, and run away to the woods and the fields, to gather wild\r\n  flowers, or wade in the ponds for fragrant lilies, happy in the\r\n  bright sunshine.\r\n\r\n  If my little sister comes to Boston next June, will you let me\r\n  bring her to see you? She is a lovely baby, and I am sure you\r\n  will love her.\r\n\r\n  Now I must tell my gentle poet good-bye, for I have a letter to\r\n  write home before I go to bed.\r\n  From your loving little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS SARAH FULLER [Miss Fuller gave Helen Keller her first\r\n  lesson in articulation. See Chapter IV, Speech.]\r\n  South Boston, Mass., April 3, 1890.\r\n\r\n  My dear Miss Fuller,\r\n  My heart is full of joy this beautiful morning, because I have\r\n  learned to speak many new words, and I can make a few sentences.\r\n  Last evening I went out in the yard and spoke to the moon. I\r\n  said, "O! moon come to me!" Do you think the lovely moon was glad\r\n  that I could speak to her? How glad my mother will be. I can\r\n  hardly wait for June to come I am so eager to speak to her and to\r\n  my precious little sister. Mildred could not understand me when I\r\n  spelled with my fingers, but now she will sit in my lap and I\r\n  will tell her many things to please her, and we shall be so happy\r\n  together. Are you very, very happy because you can make so many\r\n  people happy? I think you are very kind and patient, and I love\r\n  you very dearly. My teacher told me Tuesday that you wanted to\r\n  know how I came to wish to talk with my mouth. I will tell you\r\n  all about it, for I remember my thoughts perfectly. When I was a\r\n  very little child I used to sit in my mother\'s lap all the time,\r\n  because I was very timid, and did not like to be left by myself.\r\n  And I would keep my little hand on her face all the while,\r\n  because it amused me to feel her face and lips move when she\r\n  talked with people. I did not know then what she was doing, for I\r\n  was quite ignorant of all things. Then when I was older I learned\r\n  to play with my nurse and the little negro children and I noticed\r\n  that they kept moving their lips just like my mother, so I moved\r\n  mine too, but sometimes it made me angry and I would hold my\r\n  playmates\' mouths very hard. I did not know then that it was very\r\n  naughty to do so. After a long time my dear teacher came to me,\r\n  and taught me to communicate with my fingers and I was satisfied\r\n  and happy. But when I came to school in Boston I met some deaf\r\n  people who talked with their mouths like all other people, and\r\n  one day a lady who had been to Norway came to see me, and told me\r\n  of a blind and deaf girl [Ragnhild Kaata] she had seen in that\r\n  far away land who had been taught to speak and understand others\r\n  when they spoke to her. This good and happy news delighted me\r\n  exceedingly, for then I was sure that I should learn also. I\r\n  tried to make sounds like my little playmates, but teacher told\r\n  me that the voice was very delicate and sensitive and that it\r\n  would injure it to make incorrect sounds, and promised to take me\r\n  to see a kind and wise lady who would teach me rightly. That lady\r\n  was yourself. Now I am as happy as the little birds, because I\r\n  can speak and perhaps I shall sing too. All of my friends will be\r\n  so surprised and glad.\r\n  Your loving little pupil,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the Perkins Institution closed for the summer, Helen and\r\n  Miss Sullivan went to Tuscumbia. This was the first home-going\r\n  after she had learned to "talk with her mouth."\r\n\r\n  TO  REV. PHILLIPS BROOKS\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama, July 14, 1890.\r\n\r\n  My dear Mr. Brooks, I am very glad to write to you this beautiful\r\n  day because you are my kind friend and I love you, and because I\r\n  wish to know many things.   I have been at home three weeks, and\r\n  Oh, how happy I have been with dear mother and father and\r\n  precious little sister. I was very, very sad to part with all of\r\n  my friends in Boston, but I was so eager to see my baby sister I\r\n  could hardly wait for the train to take me home. But I tried very\r\n  hard to be patient for teacher\'s sake. Mildred has grown much\r\n  taller and stronger than she was when I went to Boston, and she\r\n  is the sweetest and dearest little child in the world. My parents\r\n  were delighted to hear me speak, and I was overjoyed to give them\r\n  such a happy surprise. I think it is so pleasant to make\r\n  everybody happy. Why does the dear Father in heaven think it best\r\n  for us to have very great sorrow sometimes? I am always happy and\r\n  so was Little Lord Fauntleroy, but dear Little Jakey\'s life was\r\n  full of sadness. God did not put the light in Jakey\'s eyes and he\r\n  was blind, and his father was not gentle and loving. Do you think\r\n  poor Jakey loved his Father in heaven more because his other\r\n  father was unkind to him? How did God tell people that his home\r\n  was in heaven? When people do very wrong and hurt animals and\r\n  treat children unkindly God is grieved, but what will he do to\r\n  them to teach them to be pitiful and loving? I think he will tell\r\n  them how dearly He loves them and that He wants them to be good\r\n  and happy, and they will not wish to grieve their father who\r\n  loves them so much, and they will want to please him in\r\n  everything they do, so they will love each other and do good to\r\n  everyone, and be kind to animals.\r\n\r\n  Please tell me something that you know about God. It makes me\r\n  happy to know much about my loving Father, who is good and wise.\r\n  I hope you will write to your little friend when you have time. I\r\n  should like very much to see you to-day Is the sun very hot in\r\n  Boston now? this afternoon if it is cool enough I shall take\r\n  Mildred for a ride on my donkey. Mr. Wade sent Neddy to me, and\r\n  he is the prettiest donkey you can imagine. My great dog Lioness\r\n  goes with us when we ride to protect us. Simpson, that is my\r\n  brother, brought me some beautiful pond lilies yesterday--he is a\r\n  very brother to me.\r\n\r\n  Teacher sends you her kind remembrances, and father and mother\r\n  also send their regards.\r\n  From your loving little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DR. BROOKS\'S REPLY\r\n  London, August 3, 1890.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Helen--I was very glad indeed to get your letter. It has\r\n  followed me across the ocean and found me in this magnificent\r\n  great city which I should like to tell you all about if I could\r\n  take time for it and make my letter long enough. Some time when\r\n  you come and see me in my study in Boston I shall be glad to talk\r\n  to you about it all if you care to hear.\r\n\r\n  But now I want to tell you how glad I am that you are so happy\r\n  and enjoying your home so very much. I can almost think I see you\r\n  with your father and mother and little sister, with all the\r\n  brightness of the beautiful country about you, and it makes me\r\n  very glad to know how glad you are.\r\n\r\n  I am glad also to know, from the questions which you ask me, what\r\n  you are thinking about. I do not see how we can help thinking\r\n  about God when He is so good to us all the time. Let me tell you\r\n  how it seems to me that we come to know about our heavenly\r\n  Father. It is from the power of love which is in our own hearts.\r\n  Love is at the soul of everything. Whatever has not the power of\r\n  loving must have a very dreary life indeed. We like to think that\r\n  the sunshine and the winds and the trees are able to love in some\r\n  way of their own, for it would make us know that they were happy\r\n  if we knew that they could love. And so God who is the greatest\r\n  and happiest of all beings is the most loving too. All the love\r\n  that is in our hearts comes from him, as all the light which is\r\n  in the flowers comes from the sun. And the more we love the more\r\n  near we are to God and His Love.\r\n\r\n  I told you that I was very happy because of your happiness.\r\n  Indeed I am. So are your Father and your Mother and your Teacher\r\n  and all your friends. But do you not think that God is happy too\r\n  because you are happy? I am sure He is. And He is happier than\r\n  any of us because He is greater than any of us, and also because\r\n  He not merely SEES your happiness as we do, but He also MADE it.\r\n  He gives it to you as the sun gives light and color to the rose.\r\n  And we are always most glad of what we not merely see our friends\r\n  enjoy, but of what we give them to enjoy. Are we not?\r\n\r\n  But God does not only want us to be HAPPY; He wants us to be\r\n  good. He wants that most of all. He knows that we can be really\r\n  happy only when we are good. A great deal of the trouble that is\r\n  in the world is medicine which is very bad to take, but which it\r\n  is good to take because it makes us better. We see how good\r\n  people may be in great trouble when we think of Jesus who was the\r\n  greatest sufferer that ever lived and yet was the best Being and\r\n  so, I am sure, the happiest Being that the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\n  I love to tell you about God. But He will tell you Himself by the\r\n  love which He will put into your heart if you ask Him. And Jesus,\r\n  who is His Son, but is nearer to Him than all of us His other\r\n  Children, came into the world on purpose to tell us all about our\r\n  Father\'s Love. If you read His words, you will see how full His\r\n  heart is of the love of God. "We KNOW that He loves us," He says.\r\n  And so He loved men Himself and though they were very cruel to\r\n  Him and at last killed Him, He was willing to die for them\r\n  because He loved them so. And, Helen, He loves men still, and He\r\n  loves us, and He tells us that we may love Him.\r\n\r\n  And so love is everything. And if anybody asks you, or if you ask\r\n  yourself what God is, answer, "God is Love." That is the\r\n  beautiful answer which the Bible gives.\r\n\r\n  All this is what you are to think of and to understand more and\r\n  more as you grow older. Think of it now, and let it make every\r\n  blessing brighter because your dear Father sends it to you.\r\n\r\n  You will come back to Boston I hope soon after I do. I shall be\r\n  there by the middle of September. I shall want you to tell me all\r\n  about everything, and not forget the Donkey.\r\n\r\n  I send my kind remembrance to your father and mother, and to your\r\n  teacher. I wish I could see your little sister.\r\n\r\n  Good Bye, dear Helen. Do write to me soon again, directing your\r\n  letter to Boston.\r\n  Your affectionate friend\r\n  PHILLIPS BROOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  DR. HOLMES\'S REPLY\r\n  To a letter which has been lost.\r\n\r\n  Beverly Farms, Mass., August 1, 1890.\r\n  My Dear Little Friend Helen:\r\n\r\n  I received your welcome letter several days ago, but I have so\r\n  much writing to do that I am apt to make my letters wait a good\r\n  while before they get answered.\r\n\r\n  It gratifies me very much to find that you remember me so kindly.\r\n  Your letter is charming, and I am greatly pleased with it. I\r\n  rejoice to know that you are well and happy. I am very much\r\n  delighted to hear of your new acquisition--that you "talk with\r\n  your mouth" as well as with your fingers. What a curious thing\r\n  SPEECH is! The tongue is so serviceable a member (taking all\r\n  sorts of shapes, just as is wanted),--the teeth, the lips, the\r\n  roof of the mouth, all ready to help, and so heap up the sound of\r\n  the voice into the solid bits which we call consonants, and make\r\n  room for the curiously shaped breathings which we call vowels!\r\n  You have studied all this, I don\'t doubt, since you have\r\n  practised vocal speaking.\r\n\r\n  I am surprised at the mastery of language which your letter\r\n  shows. It almost makes me think the world would get along as well\r\n  without seeing and hearing as with them. Perhaps people would be\r\n  better in a great many ways, for they could not fight as they do\r\n  now. Just think of an army of blind people, with guns and cannon!\r\n  Think of the poor drummers! Of what use would they and their\r\n  drumsticks be? You are spared the pain of many sights and sounds,\r\n  which you are only too happy in escaping. Then think how much\r\n  kindness you are sure of as long as you live. Everybody will feel\r\n  an interest in dear little Helen; everybody will want to do\r\n  something for her; and, if she becomes an ancient, gray-haired\r\n  woman, she is still sure of being thoughtfully cared for.\r\n\r\n  Your parents and friends must take great satisfaction in your\r\n  progress. It does great credit, not only to you, but to your\r\n  instructors, who have so broken down the walls that seemed to\r\n  shut you in that now your outlook seems more bright and cheerful\r\n  than that of many seeing and hearing children.\r\n\r\n  Good-bye, dear little Helen! With every kind wish from your\r\n  friend,\r\n  OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This letter was written to some gentlemen in Gardiner, Maine, who\r\n  named a lumber vessel after her.\r\n\r\n  TO MESSRS. BRADSTREET\r\n  Tuscumbia, Ala., July 14, 1890.\r\n\r\n  My Dear, Kind Friends:--I thank you very, very much for naming\r\n  your beautiful new ship for me. It makes me very happy to know\r\n  that I have kind and loving friends in the far-away State of\r\n  Maine. I did not imagine, when I studied about the forests of\r\n  Maine, that a strong and beautiful ship would go sailing all over\r\n  the world, carrying wood from those rich forests, to build\r\n  pleasant homes and schools and churches in distant countries. I\r\n  hope the great ocean will love the new Helen, and let her sail\r\n  over its blue waves peacefully. Please tell the brave sailors,\r\n  who have charge of the HELEN KELLER, that little Helen who stays\r\n  at home will often think of them with loving thoughts. I hope I\r\n  shall see you and my beautiful namesake some time.\r\n\r\n  With much love, from your little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n  To the Messrs. Bradstreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Helen and Miss Sullivan returned to the Perkins Institution early\r\n  in November.\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER\r\n  South Boston, Nov. 10, 1890.\r\n\r\n  My Dearest Mother:--My heart has been full of thoughts of you and\r\n  my beautiful home ever since we parted so sadly on Wednesday\r\n  night. How I wish I could see you this lovely morning, and tell\r\n  you all that has happened since I left home! And my darling\r\n  little sister, how I wish I could give her a hundred kisses! And\r\n  my dear father, how he would like to hear about our journey! But\r\n  I cannot see you and talk to you, so I will write and tell you\r\n  all that I can think of.\r\n\r\n  We did not reach Boston until Saturday morning. I am sorry to say\r\n  that our train was delayed in several places, which made us late\r\n  in reaching New York. When we got to Jersey City at six o\'clock\r\n  Friday evening we were obliged to cross the Harlem River in a\r\n  ferry-boat. We found the boat and the transfer carriage with much\r\n  less difficulty than teacher expected. When we arrived at the\r\n  station they told us that the train did not leave for Boston\r\n  until eleven o\'clock, but that we could take the sleeper at nine,\r\n  which we did. We went to bed and slept until morning. When we\r\n  awoke we were in Boston. I was delighted to get there, though I\r\n  was much disappointed because we did not arrive on Mr. Anagnos\'\r\n  birthday. We surprised our dear friends, however, for they did\r\n  not expect us Saturday; but when the bell rung Miss Marrett\r\n  guessed who was at the door, and Mrs. Hopkins jumped up from the\r\n  breakfast table and ran to the door to meet us; she was indeed\r\n  much astonished to see us. After we had had some breakfast we\r\n  went up to see Mr. Anagnos. I was overjoyed to see my dearest and\r\n  kindest friend once more. He gave me a beautiful watch. I have it\r\n  pinned to my dress. I tell everybody the time when they ask me. I\r\n  have only seen Mr. Anagnos twice. I have many questions to ask\r\n  him about the countries he has been travelling in. But I suppose\r\n  he is very busy now.\r\n\r\n  The hills in Virginia were very lovely. Jack Frost had dressed\r\n  them in gold and crimson. The view was most charmingly\r\n  picturesque. Pennsylvania is a very beautiful State. The grass\r\n  was as green as though it was springtime, and the golden ears of\r\n  corn gathered together in heaps in the great fields looked very\r\n  pretty. In Harrisburg we saw a donkey like Neddy. How I wish I\r\n  could see my own donkey and my dear Lioness! Do they miss their\r\n  mistress very much? Tell Mildred she must be kind to them for my\r\n  sake.\r\n\r\n  Our room is pleasant and comfortable.\r\n\r\n  My typewriter was much injured coming. The case was broken and\r\n  the keys are nearly all out. Teacher is going to see if it can be\r\n  fixed.\r\n\r\n  There are many new books in the library. What a nice time I shall\r\n  have reading them! I have already read Sara Crewe. It is a very\r\n  pretty story, and I will tell it to you some time. Now, sweet\r\n  mother, your little girl must say good-bye.\r\n\r\n  With much love to father, Mildred, you and all the dear friends,\r\n  lovingly your little daughter,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER\r\n  South Boston, Dec. 17, 1890.\r\n\r\n  Dear Kind Poet,\r\n  This is your birthday; that was the first thought which came into\r\n  my mind when I awoke this morning; and it made me glad to think I\r\n  could write you a letter and tell you how much your little\r\n  friends love their sweet poet and his birthday. This evening they\r\n  are going to entertain their friends with readings from your\r\n  poems and music. I hope the swift winged messengers of love will\r\n  be here to carry some of the sweet melody to you, in your little\r\n  study by the Merrimac. At first I was very sorry when I found\r\n  that the sun had hidden his shining face behind dull clouds, but\r\n  afterwards I thought why he did it, and then I was happy. The sun\r\n  knows that you like to see the world covered with beautiful white\r\n  snow and so he kept back all his brightness, and let the little\r\n  crystals form in the sky. When they are ready, they will softly\r\n  fall and tenderly cover every object. Then the sun will appear in\r\n  all his radiance and fill the world with light. If I were with\r\n  you to-day I would give you eighty-three kisses, one for each\r\n  year you have lived. Eighty-three years seems very long to me.\r\n  Does it seem long to you? I wonder how many years there will be\r\n  in eternity. I am afraid I cannot think about so much time. I\r\n  received the letter which you wrote to me last summer, and I\r\n  thank you for it. I am staying in Boston now at the Institution\r\n  for the Blind, but I have not commenced my studies yet, because\r\n  my dearest friend, Mr. Anagnos wants me to rest and play a great\r\n  deal.\r\n\r\n  Teacher is well and sends her kind remembrance to you. The happy\r\n  Christmas time is almost here! I can hardly wait for the fun to\r\n  begin! I hope your Christmas Day will be a very happy one and\r\n  that the New Year will be full of brightness and joy for you and\r\n  every one.\r\n  From your little friend\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  WHITTIER\'S REPLY\r\n\r\n  My Dear Young Friend--I was very glad to have such a pleasant\r\n  letter on my birthday. I had two or three hundred others and\r\n  thine was one of the most welcome of all. I must tell thee about\r\n  how the day passed at Oak Knoll. Of course the sun did not shine,\r\n  but we had great open wood fires in the rooms, which were all\r\n  very sweet with roses and other flowers, which were sent to me\r\n  from distant friends; and fruits of all kinds from California and\r\n  other places. Some relatives and dear old friends were with me\r\n  through the day. I do not wonder thee thinks eighty three years a\r\n  long time, but to me it seems but a very little while since I was\r\n  a boy no older than thee, playing on the old farm at Haverhill. I\r\n  thank thee for all thy good wishes, and wish thee as many. I am\r\n  glad thee is at the Institution; it is an excellent place. Give\r\n  my best regards to Miss Sullivan, and with a great deal of love I\r\n  am\r\n  Thy old friend,\r\n  JOHN G. WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tommy Stringer, who appears in several of the following letters,\r\n  became blind and deaf when he was four years old. His mother was\r\n  dead and his father was too poor to take care of him. For a while\r\n  he was kept in the general hospital at Allegheny. From here he\r\n  was to be sent to an almshouse, for at that time there was no\r\n  other place for him in Pennsylvania. Helen heard of him through\r\n  Mr. J. G. Brown of Pittsburgh, who wrote her that he had failed\r\n  to secure a tutor for Tommy. She wanted him brought to Boston,\r\n  and when she was told that money would be needed to get him a\r\n  teacher, she answered, "We will raise it." She began to solicit\r\n  contributions from her friends, and saved her pennies.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Alexander Graham Bell advised Tommy\'s friends to send him to\r\n  Boston, and the trustees of the Perkins Institution agreed to\r\n  admit him to the kindergarten for the blind.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile opportunity came to Helen to make a considerable\r\n  contribution to Tommy\'s education. The winter before, her dog\r\n  Lioness had been killed, and friends set to work to raise money\r\n  to buy Helen another dog. Helen asked that the contributions,\r\n  which people were sending from all over America and England, be\r\n  devoted to Tommy\'s education. Turned to this new use, the fund\r\n  grew fast, and Tommy was provided for. He was admitted to the\r\n  kindergarten on the sixth of April.\r\n\r\n  Miss Keller wrote lately, "I shall never forget the pennies sent\r\n  by many a poor child who could ill spare them, \'for little\r\n  Tommy,\' or the swift sympathy with which people from far and\r\n  near, whom I had never seen, responded to the dumb cry of a\r\n  little captive soul for aid."\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. GEORGE R. KREHL\r\n  Institution for the Blind,\r\n  South Boston, Mass., March 20, 1891.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Friend, Mr. Krehl:--I have just heard, through Mr. Wade,\r\n  of your kind offer to buy me a gentle dog, and I want to thank\r\n  you for the kind thought. It makes me very happy indeed to know\r\n  that I have such dear friends in other lands. It makes me think\r\n  that all people are good and loving. I have read that the English\r\n  and Americans are cousins; but I am sure it would be much truer\r\n  to say that we are brothers and sisters. My friends have told me\r\n  about your great and magnificent city, and I have read a great\r\n  deal that wise Englishmen have written. I have begun to read\r\n  "Enoch Arden," and I know several of the great poet\'s poems by\r\n  heart. I am eager to cross the ocean, for I want to see my\r\n  English friends and their good and wise queen. Once the Earl of\r\n  Meath came to see me, and he told me that the queen was much\r\n  beloved by her people, because of her gentleness and wisdom. Some\r\n  day you will be surprised to see a little strange girl coming\r\n  into your office; but when you know it is the little girl who\r\n  loves dogs and all other animals, you will laugh, and I hope you\r\n  will give her a kiss, just as Mr. Wade does. He has another dog\r\n  for me, and he thinks she will be as brave and faithful as my\r\n  beautiful Lioness. And now I want to tell you what the dog lovers\r\n  in America are going to do. They are going to send me some money\r\n  for a poor little deaf and dumb and blind child. His name is\r\n  Tommy, and he is five years old. His parents are too poor to pay\r\n  to have the little fellow sent to school; so, instead of giving\r\n  me a dog, the gentlemen are going to help make Tommy\'s life as\r\n  bright and joyous as mine. Is it not a beautiful plan? Education\r\n  will bring light and music into Tommy\'s soul, and then he cannot\r\n  help being happy.\r\n  From your loving little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  DR. OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES\r\n  [South Boston, Mass., April, 1891.]\r\n\r\n  Dear Dr. Holmes:--Your beautiful words about spring have been\r\n  making music in my heart, these bright April days. I love every\r\n  word of "Spring" and "Spring Has Come." I think you will be glad\r\n  to hear that these poems have taught me to enjoy and love the\r\n  beautiful springtime, even though I cannot see the fair, frail\r\n  blossoms which proclaim its approach, or hear the joyous warbling\r\n  of the home-coming birds. But when I read "Spring Has Come," lo!\r\n  I am not blind any longer, for I see with your eyes and hear with\r\n  your ears. Sweet Mother Nature can have no secrets from me when\r\n  my poet is near. I have chosen this paper because I want the\r\n  spray of violets in the corner to tell you of my grateful love. I\r\n  want you to see baby Tom, the little blind and deaf and dumb\r\n  child who has just come to our pretty garden. He is poor and\r\n  helpless and lonely now, but before another April education will\r\n  have brought light and gladness into Tommy\'s life. If you do\r\n  come, you will want to ask the kind people of Boston to help\r\n  brighten Tommy\'s whole life. Your loving friend,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  SIR JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS\r\n  Perkins Institution for the Blind,\r\n  South Boston, Mass., April 30, 1891.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Mr. Millais:--Your little American sister is going to\r\n  write you a letter, because she wants you to know how pleased she\r\n  was to hear you were interested in our poor little Tommy, and had\r\n  sent some money to help educate him. It is very beautiful to\r\n  think that people far away in England feel sorry for a little\r\n  helpless child in America. I used to think, when I read in my\r\n  books about your great city, that when I visited it the people\r\n  would be strangers to me, but now I feel differently. It seems to\r\n  me that all people who have loving, pitying hearts, are not\r\n  strangers to each other. I can hardly wait patiently for the time\r\n  to come when I shall see my dear English friends, and their\r\n  beautiful island home. My favourite poet has written some lines\r\n  about England which I love very much. I think you will like them\r\n  too, so I will try to write them for you.\r\n\r\n  "Hugged in the clinging billow\'s clasp,\r\n  From seaweed fringe to mountain heather,\r\n  The British oak with rooted grasp\r\n  Her slender handful holds together,\r\n  With cliffs of white and bowers of green,\r\n  And ocean narrowing to caress her,\r\n  And hills and threaded streams between,\r\n  Our little mother isle, God bless her!"\r\n\r\n  You will be glad to hear that Tommy has a kind lady to teach him,\r\n  and that he is a pretty, active little fellow. He loves to climb\r\n  much better than to spell, but that is because he does not know\r\n  yet what a wonderful thing language is. He cannot imagine how\r\n  very, very happy he will be when he can tell us his thoughts, and\r\n  we can tell him how we have loved him so long.\r\n\r\n  Tomorrow April will hide her tears and blushes beneath the\r\n  flowers of lovely May. I wonder if the May-days in England are as\r\n  beautiful as they are here.\r\n\r\n  Now I must say good-bye. Please think of me always as your loving\r\n  little sister,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  REV. PHILLIPS BROOKS\r\n  So. Boston, May 1, 1891.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Mr. Brooks:\r\n  Helen sends you a loving greeting this bright May-day. My teacher\r\n  has just told me that you have been made a bishop, and that your\r\n  friends everywhere are rejoicing because one whom they love has\r\n  been greatly honored. I do not understand very well what a\r\n  bishop\'s work is, but I am sure it must be good and helpful, and\r\n  I am glad that my dear friend is brave, and wise, and loving\r\n  enough to do it. It is very beautiful to think that you can tell\r\n  so many people of the heavenly Father\'s tender love for all His\r\n  children even when they are not gentle and noble as He wishes\r\n  them to be. I hope the glad news which you will tell them will\r\n  make their hearts beat fast with joy and love. I hope too, that\r\n  Bishop Brooks\' whole life will be as rich in happiness as the\r\n  month of May is full of blossoms and singing birds.\r\n  From your loving little friend,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Before a teacher was found for Tommy and while he was still in\r\n  the care of Helen and Miss Sullivan, a reception was held for him\r\n  at the kindergarten. At Helen\'s request Bishop Brooks made an\r\n  address. Helen wrote letters to the newspapers which brought many\r\n  generous replies. All of these she answered herself, and she made\r\n  public acknowledgment in letters to the newspapers. This letter\r\n  is to the editor of the Boston Herald, enclosing a complete list\r\n  of the subscribers. The contributions amounted to more than\r\n  sixteen hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN H. HOLMES\r\n  South Boston, May 13, 1891.\r\n  Editor of the Boston Herald:\r\n  My Dear Mr. Holmes:--Will you kindly print in the Herald, the\r\n  enclosed list? I think the readers of your paper will be glad to\r\n  know that so much has been done for dear little Tommy, and that\r\n  they will all wish to share in the pleasure of helping him. He is\r\n  very happy indeed at the kindergarten, and is learning something\r\n  every day. He has found out that doors have locks, and that\r\n  little sticks and bits of paper can be got into the key-hole\r\n  quite easily; but he does not seem very eager to get them out\r\n  after they are in. He loves to climb the bed-posts and unscrew\r\n  the steam valves much better than to spell, but that is because\r\n  he does not understand that words would help him to make new and\r\n  interesting discoveries. I hope that good people will continue to\r\n  work for Tommy until his fund is completed, and education has\r\n  brought light and music into his little life.\r\n  From your little friend,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO DR. OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES\r\n  South Boston, May 27, 1891.\r\n  Dear, Gentle Poet:--I fear that you will think Helen a very\r\n  troublesome little girl if she writes to you too often; but how\r\n  is she to help sending you loving and grateful messages, when you\r\n  do so much to make her glad? I cannot begin to tell you how\r\n  delighted I was when Mr. Anagnos told me that you had sent him\r\n  some money to help educate "Baby Tom." Then I knew that you had\r\n  not forgotten the dear little child, for the gift brought with it\r\n  the thought of tender sympathy. I am very sorry to say that Tommy\r\n  has not learned any words yet. He is the same restless little\r\n  creature he was when you saw him. But it is pleasant to think\r\n  that he is happy and playful in his bright new home, and by and\r\n  by that strange, wonderful thing teacher calls MIND, will begin\r\n  to spread its beautiful wings and fly away in search of\r\n  knowledge-land. Words are the mind\'s wings, are they not?\r\n\r\n  I have been to Andover since I saw you, and I was greatly\r\n  interested in all that my friends told me about Phillips Academy,\r\n  because I knew you had been there, and I felt it was a place dear\r\n  to you. I tried to imagine my gentle poet when he was a\r\n  school-boy, and I wondered if it was in Andover he learned the\r\n  songs of the birds and the secrets of the shy little woodland\r\n  children. I am sure his heart was always full of music, and in\r\n  God\'s beautiful world he must have heard love\'s sweet replying.\r\n  When I came home teacher read to me "The School-boy," for it is\r\n  not in our print.\r\n\r\n  Did you know that the blind children are going to have their\r\n  commencement exercises in Tremont Temple, next Tuesday afternoon?\r\n  I enclose a ticket, hoping that you will come. We shall all be\r\n  proud and happy to welcome our poet friend. I shall recite about\r\n  the beautiful cities of sunny Italy. I hope our kind friend Dr.\r\n  Ellis will come too, and take Tom in his arms.\r\n\r\n  With much love and a kiss, from your little friend,\r\n  HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO REV. PHILLIPS BROOKS\r\n  South Boston, June 8, 1891.\r\n  My dear Mr. Brooks,\r\n  I send you my picture as I promised, and I hope when you look at\r\n  it this summer your thoughts will fly southward to your happy\r\n  little friend. I used to wish that I could see pictures with my\r\n  hands as I do statues, but now I do not often think about it\r\n  because my dear Father has filled my mind with beautiful\r\n  pictures, even of things I cannot see. If the light were not in\r\n  your eyes, dear Mr. Brooks, you would understand better how happy\r\n  your little Helen was when her teacher explained to her that the\r\n  best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen nor\r\n  even touched, but just felt in the heart. Every day I find out\r\n  something which makes me glad. Yesterday I thought for the first\r\n  time what a beautiful thing motion was, and it seemed to me that\r\n  everything was trying to get near to God, does it seem that way\r\n  to you? It is Sunday morning, and while I sit here in the library\r\n  writing this letter you are teaching hundreds of people some of\r\n  the grand and beautiful things about their heavenly Father. Are\r\n  you not very, very happy? and when you are a Bishop you will\r\n  preach to more people and more and more will be made glad.\r\n  Teacher sends her kind remembrances, and I send you with my\r\n  picture my dear love.\r\n  From your little friend\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the Perkins Institution closed in June, Helen and her\r\n  teacher went south to Tuscumbia, where they remained until\r\n  December. There is a hiatus of several months in the letters,\r\n  caused by the depressing effect on Helen and Miss Sullivan of the\r\n  "Frost King" episode. At the time this trouble seemed very grave\r\n  and brought them much unhappiness. An analysis of the case has\r\n  been made elsewhere, and Miss Keller has written her account of\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MR. ALBERT H. MUNSELL\r\n  Brewster, Mar. 10, 1892.\r\n  My dear Mr. Munsell,\r\n  Surely I need not tell you that your letter was very welcome. I\r\n  enjoyed every word of it and wished that it was longer. I laughed\r\n  when you spoke of old Neptune\'s wild moods. He has, in truth,\r\n  behaved very strangely ever since we came to Brewster. It is\r\n  evident that something has displeased his Majesty but I cannot\r\n  imagine what it can be. His expression has been so turbulent that\r\n  I have feared to give him your kind message. Who knows! Perhaps\r\n  the Old Sea God as he lay asleep upon the shore, heard the soft\r\n  music of growing things--the stir of life in the earth\'s bosom,\r\n  and his stormy heart was angry, because he knew that his and\r\n  Winter\'s reign was almost at an end. So together the unhappy\r\n  monarch[s] fought most despairingly, thinking that gentle Spring\r\n  would turn and fly at the very sight of the havoc caused by their\r\n  forces. But lo! the lovely maiden only smiles more sweetly, and\r\n  breathes upon the icy battlements of her enemies, and in a moment\r\n  they vanish, and the glad Earth gives her a royal welcome. But I\r\n  must put away these idle fancies until we meet again. Please give\r\n  your dear mother my love. Teacher wishes me to say that she liked\r\n  the photograph very much and she will see about having some when\r\n  we return. Now, dear friend, Please accept these few words\r\n  because of the love that is linked with them.\r\n  Lovingly yours\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This letter was reproduced in facsimile in St. Nicholas, June,\r\n  1892. It is undated, but must have been written two or three\r\n  months before it was published.\r\n\r\n  To St. Nicholas\r\n  Dear St. Nicholas:\r\n\r\n  It gives me very great pleasure to send you my autograph because\r\n  I want the boys and girls who read St. Nicholas to know how blind\r\n  children write. I suppose some of them wonder how we keep the\r\n  lines so straight so I will try to tell them how it is done. We\r\n  have a grooved board which we put between the pages when we wish\r\n  to write. The parallel grooves correspond to lines and when we\r\n  have pressed the paper into them by means of the blunt end of the\r\n  pencil it is very easy to keep the words even. The small letters\r\n  are all made in the grooves, while the long ones extend above and\r\n  below them. We guide the pencil with the right hand, and feel\r\n  carefully with the forefinger of the left hand to see that we\r\n  shape and space the letters correctly. It is very difficult at\r\n  first to form them plainly, but if we keep on trying it gradually\r\n  becomes easier, and after a great deal of practice we can write\r\n  legible letters to our friends. Then we are very, very happy.\r\n  Sometime they may visit a school for the blind. If they do, I am\r\n  sure they will wish to see the pupils write.\r\n  Very sincerely your little friend\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In May, 1892, Helen gave a tea in aid of the kindergarten for the\r\n  blind. It was quite her own idea, and was given in the house of\r\n  Mrs. Mahlon D. Spaulding, sister of Mr. John P. Spaulding, one of\r\n  Helen\'s kindest and most liberal friends. The tea brought more\r\n  than two thousand dollars for the blind children.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  South Boston, May 9, 1892.\r\n  My dear Miss Carrie:--I was much pleased to receive your kind\r\n  letter. Need I tell you that I was more than delighted to hear\r\n  that you are really interested in the "tea"? Of course we must\r\n  not give it up. Very soon I am going far away, to my own dear\r\n  home, in the sunny south, and it would always make me happy to\r\n  think that the last thing which my dear friends in Boston did for\r\n  my pleasure was to help make the lives of many little sightless\r\n  children good and happy. I know that kind people cannot help\r\n  feeling a tender sympathy for the little ones, who cannot see the\r\n  beautiful light, or any of the wonderful things which give them\r\n  pleasure; and it seems to me that all loving sympathy must\r\n  express itself in acts of kindness; and when the friends of\r\n  little helpless blind children understand that we are working for\r\n  their happiness, they will come and make our "tea" a success, and\r\n  I am sure I shall be the happiest little girl in all the world.\r\n  Please let Bishop Brooks know our plans, so that he may arrange\r\n  to be with us. I am glad Miss Eleanor is interested. Please give\r\n  her my love. I will see you to-morrow and then we can make the\r\n  rest of our plans. Please give your dear aunt teacher\'s and my\r\n  love and tell her that we enjoyed our little visit very much\r\n  indeed.\r\n  Lovingly yours,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MR. JOHN P. SPAULDING\r\n  South Boston, May 11th, 1892.\r\n  My dear Mr. Spaulding:--I am afraid you will think your little\r\n  friend, Helen, very troublesome when you read this letter; but I\r\n  am sure you will not blame me when I tell you that I am very\r\n  anxious about something. You remember teacher and I told you\r\n  Sunday that I wanted to have a little tea in aid of the\r\n  kindergarten. We thought everything was arranged: but we found\r\n  Monday that Mrs. Elliott would not be willing to let us invite\r\n  more than fifty people, because Mrs. Howe\'s house is quite small.\r\n  I am sure that a great many people would like to come to the tea,\r\n  and help me do something to brighten the lives of little blind\r\n  children; but some of my friends say that I shall have to give up\r\n  the idea of having a tea unless we can find another house.\r\n  Teacher said yesterday, that perhaps Mrs. Spaulding would be\r\n  willing to let us have her beautiful house, and [I] thought I\r\n  would ask you about it. Do you think Mrs. Spaulding would help\r\n  me, if I wrote to her? I shall be so disappointed if my little\r\n  plans fail, because I have wanted for a long time to do something\r\n  for the poor little ones who are waiting to enter the\r\n  kindergarten. Please let me know what you think about the house,\r\n  and try to forgive me for troubling you so much.\r\n  Lovingly your little friend,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. EDWARD H. CLEMENT\r\n  South Boston, May 18th, 1892.\r\n  My dear Mr. Clement:--I am going to write to you this beautiful\r\n  morning because my heart is brimful of happiness and I want you\r\n  and all my dear friends in the Transcript office to rejoice with\r\n  me. The preparations for my tea are nearly completed, and I am\r\n  looking forward joyfully to the event. I know I shall not fail.\r\n  Kind people will not disappoint me, when they know that I plead\r\n  for helpless little children who live in darkness and ignorance.\r\n  They will come to my tea and buy light,--the beautiful light of\r\n  knowledge and love for many little ones who are blind and\r\n  friendless. I remember perfectly when my dear teacher came to me.\r\n  Then I was like the little blind children who are waiting to\r\n  enter the kindergarten. There was no light in my soul. This\r\n  wonderful world with all its sunlight and beauty was hidden from\r\n  me, and I had never dreamed of its loveliness. But teacher came\r\n  to me and taught my little fingers to use the beautiful key that\r\n  has unlocked the door of my dark prison and set my spirit free.\r\n\r\n  It is my earnest wish to share my happiness with others, and I\r\n  ask the kind people of Boston to help me make the lives of little\r\n  blind children brighter and happier.\r\n  Lovingly your little friend,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the end of June Miss Sullivan and Helen went home to\r\n  Tuscumbia.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama, July 9th 1892.\r\n\r\n  My dear Carrie--You are to look upon it as a most positive proof\r\n  of my love that I write to you to-day. For a whole week it has\r\n  been "cold and dark and dreary" in Tuscumbia, and I must confess\r\n  the continuous rain and dismalness of the weather fills me with\r\n  gloomy thoughts and makes the writing of letters, or any pleasant\r\n  employment, seem quite impossible. Nevertheless, I must tell you\r\n  that we are alive,--that we reached home safely, and that we\r\n  speak of you daily, and enjoy your interesting letters very much.\r\n  I had a beautiful visit at Hulton. Everything was fresh and\r\n  spring-like, and we stayed out of doors all day. We even ate our\r\n  breakfast out on the piazza. Sometimes we sat in the hammock, and\r\n  teacher read to me. I rode horseback nearly every evening and\r\n  once I rode five miles at a fast gallop. O, it was great fun! Do\r\n  you like to ride? I have a very pretty little cart now, and if it\r\n  ever stops raining teacher and I are going to drive every\r\n  evening. And I have another beautiful Mastiff--the largest one I\r\n  ever saw--and he will go along to protect us. His name is Eumer.\r\n  A queer name, is it not? I think it is Saxon. We expect to go to\r\n  the mountains next week. My little brother, Phillips, is not\r\n  well, and we think the clear mountain air will benefit him.\r\n  Mildred is a sweet little sister and I am sure you would love\r\n  her. I thank you very much for your photograph. I like to have my\r\n  friends\' pictures even though I cannot see them. I was greatly\r\n  amused at the idea of your writing the square hand. I do not\r\n  write on a Braille tablet, as you suppose, but on a grooved board\r\n  like the piece which I enclose. You could not read Braille; for\r\n  it is written in dots, not at all like ordinary letters. Please\r\n  give my love to Miss Derby and tell her that I hope she gave my\r\n  sweetest love to Baby Ruth. What was the book you sent me for my\r\n  birthday? I received several, and I do not know which was from\r\n  you. I had one gift which especially pleased me. It was a lovely\r\n  cape crocheted, for me, by an old gentleman, seventy-five years\r\n  of age. And every stitch, he writes, represents a kind wish for\r\n  my health and happiness. Tell your little cousins I think they\r\n  had better get upon the fence with me until after the election;\r\n  for there are so many parties and candidates that I doubt if such\r\n  youthful politicians would make a wise selection. Please give my\r\n  love to Rosy when you write, and believe me,\r\n  Your loving friend\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n  P.S. How do you like this type-written letter?\r\n  H. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. GROVER CLEVELAND\r\n  My dear Mrs. Cleveland,\r\n  I am going to write you a little letter this beautiful morning\r\n  because I love you and dear little Ruth very much indeed, and\r\n  also because I wish to thank you for the loving message which you\r\n  sent me through Miss Derby. I am glad, very glad that such a\r\n  kind, beautiful lady loves me. I have loved you for a long time,\r\n  but I did not think you had ever heard of me until your sweet\r\n  message came. Please kiss your dear little baby for me, and tell\r\n  her I have a little brother nearly sixteen months old. His name\r\n  is Phillips Brooks. I named him myself after my dear friend\r\n  Phillips Brooks. I send you with this letter a pretty book which\r\n  my teacher thinks will interest you, and my picture. Please\r\n  accept them with the love and good wishes of your friend,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama.\r\n  November fourth. [1892.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hitherto the letters have been given in full; from this point on\r\n  passages are omitted and the omissions are indicated.\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN HITZ\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama, Dec. 19, 1892.\r\n\r\n  My Dear Mr. Hitz,\r\n  I hardly know how to begin a letter to you, it has been such a\r\n  long time since your kind letter reached me, and there is so much\r\n  that I would like to write if I could. You must have wondered why\r\n  your letter has not had an answer, and perhaps you have thought\r\n  Teacher and me very naughty indeed. If so, you will be very sorry\r\n  when I tell you something. Teacher\'s eyes have been hurting her\r\n  so that she could not write to any one, and I have been trying to\r\n  fulfil a promise which I made last summer. Before I left Boston,\r\n  I was asked to write a sketch of my life for the Youth\'s\r\n  Companion. I had intended to write the sketch during my vacation:\r\n  but I was not well, and I did not feel able to write even to my\r\n  friends. But when the bright, pleasant autumn days came, and I\r\n  felt strong again I began to think about the sketch. It was some\r\n  time before I could plan it to suit me. You see, it is not very\r\n  pleasant to write all about one\'s self. At last, however, I got\r\n  something bit by bit that Teacher thought would do, and I set\r\n  about putting the scraps together, which was not an easy task:\r\n  for, although I worked some on it every day, I did not finish it\r\n  until a week ago Saturday. I sent the sketch to the Companion as\r\n  soon as it was finished; but I do not know that they will accept\r\n  it. Since then, I have not been well, and I have been obliged to\r\n  keep very quiet, and rest; but to-day I am better, and to-morrow\r\n  I shall be well again, I hope.\r\n\r\n  The reports which you have read in the paper about me are not\r\n  true at all. We received the Silent Worker which you sent, and I\r\n  wrote right away to the editor to tell him that it was a mistake.\r\n  Sometimes I am not well; but I am not a "wreck," and there is\r\n  nothing "distressing" about my condition.\r\n\r\n  I enjoyed your dear letter so much! I am always delighted when\r\n  anyone writes me a beautiful thought which I can treasure in my\r\n  memory forever. It is because my books are full of the riches of\r\n  which Mr. Ruskin speaks that I love them so dearly. I did not\r\n  realize until I began to write the sketch for the Companion, what\r\n  precious companions books have been to me, and how blessed even\r\n  my life has been: and now I am happier than ever because I do\r\n  realize the happiness that has come to me. I hope you will write\r\n  to me as often as you can. Teacher and I are always delighted to\r\n  hear from you. I want to write to Mr. Bell and send him my\r\n  picture. I suppose he has been too busy to write to his little\r\n  friend. I often think of the pleasant time we had all together in\r\n  Boston last spring.\r\n\r\n  Now I am going to tell you a secret. I think we, Teacher, and my\r\n  father and little sister, and myself, will visit Washington next\r\n  March!!! Then I shall see you, and dear Mr. Bell, and Elsie and\r\n  Daisy again! Would not it be lovely if Mrs. Pratt could meet us\r\n  there? I think I will write to her and tell her the secret\r\n  too....\r\n  Lovingly your little friend,\r\n\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n  P.S. Teacher says you want to know what kind of a pet I would\r\n  like to have. I love all living things,--I suppose everyone does;\r\n  but of course I cannot have a menagerie. I have a beautiful pony,\r\n  and a large dog. And I would like a little dog to hold in my lap,\r\n  or a big pussy (there are no fine cats in Tuscumbia) or a parrot.\r\n  I would like to feel a parrot talk, it would be so much fun! but\r\n  I would be pleased with, and love any little creature you send\r\n  me.\r\n  H. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama, February 18, 1893.\r\n  ...You have often been in my thoughts during these sad days,\r\n  while my heart has been grieving over the loss of my beloved\r\n  friend [Phillips Brooks died January 23, 1893], and I have wished\r\n  many times that I was in Boston with those who knew and loved him\r\n  as I did... he was so much of a friend to me! so tender and\r\n  loving always! I do try not to mourn his death too sadly. I do\r\n  try to think that he is still near, very near; but sometimes the\r\n  thought that he is not here, that I shall not see him when I go\r\n  to Boston,--that he is gone,--rushes over my soul like a great\r\n  wave of sorrow. But at other times, when I am happier, I do feel\r\n  his beautiful presence, and his loving hand leading me in\r\n  pleasant ways. Do you remember the happy hour we spent with him\r\n  last June when he held my hand, as he always did, and talked to\r\n  us about his friend Tennyson, and our own dear poet Dr. Holmes,\r\n  and I tried to teach him the manual alphabet, and he laughed so\r\n  gaily over his mistakes, and afterward I told him about my tea,\r\n  and he promised to come? I can hear him now, saying in his\r\n  cheerful, decided way, in reply to my wish that my tea might be a\r\n  success, "Of course it will, Helen. Put your whole heart in the\r\n  good work, my child, and it cannot fail." I am glad the people\r\n  are going to raise a monument to his memory....\r\n\r\n\r\n  In March Helen and Miss Sullivan went North, and spent the next\r\n  few months traveling and visiting friends.\r\n\r\n  In reading this letter about Niagara one should remember that\r\n  Miss Keller knows distance and shape, and that the size of\r\n  Niagara is within her experience after she has explored it,\r\n  crossed the bridge and gone down in the elevator. Especially\r\n  important are such details as her feeling the rush of the water\r\n  by putting her hand on the window. Dr. Bell gave her a down\r\n  pillow, which she held against her to increase the vibrations.\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER\r\n  South Boston, April 13, 1893.\r\n  ...Teacher, Mrs. Pratt and I very unexpectedly decided to take a\r\n  journey with dear Dr. Bell     Mr. Westervelt, a gentleman whom\r\n  father met in Washington, has a school for the deaf in Rochester.\r\n  We went there first....\r\n\r\n  Mr. Westervelt gave us a reception one afternoon. A great many\r\n  people came. Some of them asked odd questions. A lady seemed\r\n  surprised that I loved flowers when I could not see their\r\n  beautiful colors, and when I assured her I did love them, she\r\n  said, "no doubt you feel the colors with your fingers." But of\r\n  course, it is not alone for their bright colors that we love the\r\n  flowers.... A gentleman asked me what BEAUTY meant to my mind. I\r\n  must confess I was puzzled at first. But after a minute I\r\n  answered that beauty was a form of goodness--and he went away.\r\n\r\n  When the reception was over we went back to the hotel and teacher\r\n  slept quite unconscious of the surprise which was in store for\r\n  her. Mr. Bell and I planned it together, and Mr. Bell made all\r\n  the arrangements before we told teacher anything about it. This\r\n  was the surprise--I was to have the pleasure of taking my dear\r\n  teacher to see Niagara Falls!...\r\n\r\n  The hotel was so near the river that I could feel it rushing past\r\n  by putting my hand on the window. The next morning the sun rose\r\n  bright and warm, and we got up quickly for our hearts were full\r\n  of pleasant expectation.... You can never imagine how I felt when\r\n  I stood in the presence of Niagara until you have the same\r\n  mysterious sensations yourself. I could hardly realize that it\r\n  was water that I felt rushing and plunging with impetuous fury at\r\n  my feet. It seemed as if it were some living thing rushing on to\r\n  some terrible fate. I wish I could describe the cataract as it\r\n  is, its beauty and awful grandeur, and the fearful and\r\n  irresistible plunge of its waters over the brow of the precipice.\r\n  One feels helpless and overwhelmed in the presence of such a vast\r\n  force. I had the same feeling once before when I first stood by\r\n  the great ocean and felt its waves beating against the shore. I\r\n  suppose you feel so, too, when you gaze up to the stars in the\r\n  stillness of the night, do you not?... We went down a hundred and\r\n  twenty feet in an elevator that we might see the violent eddies\r\n  and whirlpools in the deep gorge below the Falls. Within two\r\n  miles of the Falls is a wonderful suspension bridge. It is thrown\r\n  across the gorge at a height of two hundred and fifty-eight feet\r\n  above the water and is supported on each bank by towers of solid\r\n  rock, which are eight hundred feet apart. When we crossed over to\r\n  the Canadian side, I cried, "God save the Queen!" Teacher said I\r\n  was a little traitor. But I do not think so. I was only doing as\r\n  the Canadians do, while I was in their country, and besides I\r\n  honor England\'s good queen.\r\n\r\n  You will be pleased, dear Mother, to hear that a kind lady whose\r\n  name is Miss Hooker is endeavoring to improve my speech. Oh, I do\r\n  so hope and pray that I shall speak well some day!...\r\n\r\n  Mr. Munsell spent last Sunday evening with us. How you would have\r\n  enjoyed hearing him tell about Venice! His beautiful\r\n  word-pictures made us feel as if we were sitting in the shadow of\r\n  San Marco, dreaming, or sailing upon the moonlit canal.... I hope\r\n  when I visit Venice, as I surely shall some day, that Mr. Munsell\r\n  will go with me. That is my castle in the air. You see, none of\r\n  my friends describe things to me so vividly and so beautifully as\r\n  he does....\r\n\r\n\r\n  Her visit to the World\'s Fair she described in a letter to Mr.\r\n  John P. Spaulding, which was published in St. Nicholas, and is\r\n  much like the following letter. In a prefatory note which Miss\r\n  Sullivan wrote for St. Nicholas, she says that people frequently\r\n  said to her, "Helen sees more with her fingers than we do with\r\n  our eyes." The President of the Exposition gave her this letter:\r\n\r\n  TO THE CHIEFS OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF\r\n  BUILDINGS AND EXHIBITS\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN--The bearer, Miss Helen Keller, accompanied by Miss\r\n  Sullivan, is desirous of making a complete inspection of the\r\n  Exposition in all Departments. She is blind and deaf, but is able\r\n  to converse, and is introduced to me as one having a wonderful\r\n  ability to understand the objects she visits, and as being\r\n  possessed of a high order of intelligence and of culture beyond\r\n  her years. Please favour her with every facility to examine the\r\n  exhibits in the several Departments, and extend to her such other\r\n  courtesies as may be possible.\r\n\r\n  Thanking you in advance for the same, I am, with respect,\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n  (signed) H. N. HIGINBOTHAM,\r\n  President.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  Hulton, Penn., August 17, 1893.\r\n\r\n  ...Every one at the Fair was very kind to me... Nearly all of the\r\n  exhibitors seemed perfectly willing to let me touch the most\r\n  delicate things, and they were very nice about explaining\r\n  everything to me. A French gentleman, whose name I cannot\r\n  remember, showed me the great French bronzes. I believe they gave\r\n  me more pleasure than anything else at the Fair: they were so\r\n  lifelike and wonderful to my touch. Dr. Bell went with us himself\r\n  to the electrical building, and showed us some of the historical\r\n  telephones. I saw the one through which Emperor Dom Pedro\r\n  listened to the words, "To be, or not to be," at the Centennial.\r\n  Dr. Gillett of Illinois took us to the Liberal Arts and Woman\'s\r\n  buildings. In the former I visited Tiffany\'s exhibit, and held\r\n  the beautiful Tiffany diamond, which is valued at one hundred\r\n  thousand dollars, and touched many other rare and costly things.\r\n  I sat in King Ludwig\'s armchair and felt like a queen when Dr.\r\n  Gillett remarked that I had many loyal subjects. At the Woman\'s\r\n  building we met the Princess Maria Schaovskoy of Russia, and a\r\n  beautiful Syrian lady. I liked them both very much. I went to the\r\n  Japanese department with Prof. Morse who is a well-known\r\n  lecturer. I never realized what a wonderful people the Japanese\r\n  are until I saw their most interesting exhibit. Japan must indeed\r\n  be a paradise for children to judge from the great number of\r\n  playthings which are manufactured there. The queer-looking\r\n  Japanese musical instruments, and their beautiful works of art\r\n  were interesting. The Japanese books are very odd. There are\r\n  forty-seven letters in their alphabets. Prof. Morse knows a great\r\n  deal about Japan, and is very kind and wise. He invited me to\r\n  visit his museum in Salem the next time I go to Boston. But I\r\n  think I enjoyed the sails on the tranquil lagoon, and the lovely\r\n  scenes, as my friends described them to me, more than anything\r\n  else at the Fair. Once, while we were out on the water, the sun\r\n  went down over the rim of the earth, and threw a soft, rosy light\r\n  over the White City, making it look more than ever like\r\n  Dreamland....\r\n\r\n  Of course, we visited the Midway Plaisance. It was a bewildering\r\n  and fascinating place. I went into the streets of Cairo, and rode\r\n  on the camel. That was fine fun. We also rode in the Ferris\r\n  wheel, and on the ice-railway, and had a sail in the\r\n  Whale-back....\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1893 a club was started in Tuscumbia, of which\r\n  Mrs. Keller was president, to establish a public library. Miss\r\n  Keller says:\r\n\r\n  "I wrote to my friends about the work and enlisted their\r\n  sympathy. Several hundred books, including many fine ones, were\r\n  sent to me in a short time, as well as money and encouragement.\r\n  This generous assistance encouraged the ladies, and they have\r\n  gone on collecting and buying books ever since, until now they\r\n  have a very respectable public library in the town."\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. CHARLES E. INCHES\r\n  Hulton, Penn., Oct. 21, 1893.\r\n  ...We spent September at home in Tuscumbia... and were all very\r\n  happy together.... Our quiet mountain home was especially\r\n  attractive and restful after the excitement and fatigue of our\r\n  visit to the World\'s Fair. We enjoyed the beauty and solitude of\r\n  the hills more than ever.\r\n\r\n  And now we are in Hulton, Penn. again where I am going to study\r\n  this winter with a tutor assisted by my dear teacher. I study\r\n  Arithmetic, Latin and literature. I enjoy my lessons very much.\r\n  It is so pleasant to learn about new things. Every day I find how\r\n  little I know, but I do not feel discouraged since God has given\r\n  me an eternity in which to learn more. In literature I am\r\n  studying Longfellow\'s poetry. I know a great deal of it by heart,\r\n  for I loved it long before I knew a metaphor from a synecdoche. I\r\n  used to say I did not like arithmetic very well, but now I have\r\n  changed my mind. I see what a good and useful study it is, though\r\n  I must confess my mind wanders from it sometimes! for, nice and\r\n  useful as arithmetic is, it is not as interesting as a beautiful\r\n  poem or a lovely story. But bless me, how time does fly. I have\r\n  only a few moments left in which to answer your questions about\r\n  the "Helen Keller" Public Library.\r\n\r\n  1. I think there are about 3,000 people in Tuscumbia, Ala., and\r\n  perhaps half of them are colored people. 2. At present there is\r\n  no library of any sort in the town. That is why I thought about\r\n  starting one. My mother and several of my lady friends said they\r\n  would help me, and they formed a club, the object of which is to\r\n  work for the establishment of a free public library in Tuscumbia.\r\n  They have now about 100 books and about $55 in money, and a kind\r\n  gentleman has given us land on which to erect a library building.\r\n  But in the meantime the club has rented a little room in a\r\n  central part of the town, and the books which we already have are\r\n  free to all. 3. Only a few of my kind friends in Boston know\r\n  anything about the library. I did not like to trouble them while\r\n  I was trying to get money for poor little Tommy, for of course it\r\n  was more important that he should be educated than that my people\r\n  should have books to read. 4. I do not know what books we have,\r\n  but I think it is a miscellaneous (I think that is the word)\r\n  collection....\r\n\r\n  P.S. My teacher thinks it would be more businesslike to say that\r\n  a list of the contributors toward the building fund will be kept\r\n  and published in my father\'s paper, the "North Alabamian."\r\n  H. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  Hulton, Penn., December 28, 1893.\r\n  ...Please thank dear Miss Derby for me for the pretty shield\r\n  which she sent me. It is a very interesting souvenir of Columbus,\r\n  and of the Fair White City; but I cannot imagine what discoveries\r\n  I have made,--I mean new discoveries. We are all discoverers in\r\n  one sense, being born quite ignorant of all things; but I hardly\r\n  think that is what she meant. Tell her she must explain why I am\r\n  a discoverer....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  DR. EDWARD EVERETT HALE\r\n  Hulton, Pennsylvania, January 14, [1894].\r\n  My dear Cousin: I had thought to write to you long before this in\r\n  answer to your kind letter which I was so glad to receive, and to\r\n  thank you for the beautiful little book which you sent me; but I\r\n  have been very busy since the beginning of the New Year. The\r\n  publication of my little story in the Youth\'s Companion has\r\n  brought me a large number of letters,--last week I received\r\n  sixty-one!--and besides replying to some of these letters, I have\r\n  many lessons to learn, among them Arithmetic and Latin; and, you\r\n  know, Caesar is Caesar still, imperious and tyrannical, and if a\r\n  little girl would understand so great a man, and the wars and\r\n  conquests of which he tells in his beautiful Latin language, she\r\n  must study much and think much, and study and thought require\r\n  time.\r\n\r\n  I shall prize the little book always, not only for its own value;\r\n  but because of its associations with you. It is a delight to\r\n  think of you as the giver of one of your books into which, I am\r\n  sure, you have wrought your own thoughts and feelings, and I\r\n  thank you very much for remembering me in such a very beautiful\r\n  way....\r\n\r\n\r\n  In February Helen and Miss Sullivan returned to Tuscumbia. They\r\n  spent the rest of the spring reading and studying. In the summer\r\n  they attended the meeting at Chautauqua of the American\r\n  Association for the Promotion of the Teaching of Speech to the\r\n  Deaf, where Miss Sullivan read a paper on Helen Keller\'s\r\n  education.\r\n\r\n  In the fall Helen and Miss Sullivan entered the Wright-Humason\r\n  School in New York, which makes a special of lip-reading and\r\n  voice-culture. The "singing lessons" were to strengthen her\r\n  voice. She had taken a few piano lessons at the Perkins\r\n  Institution. The experiment was interesting, but of course came\r\n  to little.\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  The Wright-Humason School.\r\n  42 West 76th St.\r\n  New York. Oct. 23, 1894.\r\n  ...The school is very pleasant, and bless you! it is quite\r\n  fashionable.... I study Arithmetic, English Literature and United\r\n  States History as I did last winter. I also keep a diary. I enjoy\r\n  my singing lessons with Dr. Humason more than I can say. I expect\r\n  to take piano lessons sometime....\r\n\r\n  Last Saturday our kind teachers planned a delightful trip to\r\n  Bedloe\'s Island to see Bartholdi\'s great statue of Liberty\r\n  enlightening the world.... The ancient cannon, which look\r\n  seaward, wear a very menacing expression; but I doubt if there is\r\n  any unkindness in their rusty old hearts.\r\n\r\n  Liberty is a gigantic figure of a woman in Greek draperies,\r\n  holding in her right hand a torch.... A spiral stairway leads\r\n  from the base of this pedestal to the torch. We climbed up to the\r\n  head which will hold forty persons, and viewed the scene on which\r\n  Liberty gazes day and night, and O, how wonderful it was! We did\r\n  not wonder that the great French artist thought the place worthy\r\n  to be the home of his grand ideal. The glorious bay lay calm and\r\n  beautiful in the October sunshine, and the ships came and went\r\n  like idle dreams; those seaward going slowly disappeared like\r\n  clouds that change from gold to gray; those homeward coming sped\r\n  more quickly like birds that seek their mother\'s nest....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  The Wright-Humason School.\r\n  New York, March 15, 1895.\r\n  ...I think I have improved a little in lip-reading, though I\r\n  still find it very difficult to read rapid speech; but I am sure\r\n  I shall succeed some day if I only persevere. Dr. Humason is\r\n  still trying to improve my speech. Oh, Carrie, how I should like\r\n  to speak like other people! I should be willing to work night and\r\n  day if it could only be accomplished. Think what a joy it would\r\n  be to all of my friends to hear me speak naturally!! I wonder why\r\n  it is so difficult and perplexing for a deaf child to learn to\r\n  speak when it is so easy for other people; but I am sure I shall\r\n  speak perfectly some time if I am only patient....\r\n\r\n  Although I have been so busy, I have found time to read a good\r\n  deal.... I have lately read "Wilhelm Tell" by Schiller, and "The\r\n  Lost Vestal."... Now I am reading "Nathan the Wise" by Lessing\r\n  and "King Arthur" by Miss Mulock.\r\n\r\n  ...You know our kind teachers take us to see everything which\r\n  they think will interest us, and we learn a great deal in that\r\n  delightful way. On George Washington\'s birthday we all went to\r\n  the Dog Show, and although there was a great crowd in the Madison\r\n  Square Garden, and despite the bewilderment caused by the variety\r\n  of sounds made by the dog-orchestra, which was very confusing to\r\n  those who could hear them, we enjoyed the afternoon very much.\r\n  Among the dogs which received the most attention were the\r\n  bulldogs. They permitted themselves startling liberties when any\r\n  one caressed them, crowding themselves almost into one\'s arms and\r\n  helping themselves without ceremony to kisses, apparently\r\n  unconscious of the impropriety of their conduct. Dear me, what\r\n  unbeautiful little beasts they are! But they are so good natured\r\n  and friendly, one cannot help liking them.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Humason, Teacher, and I left the others at the Dog Show and\r\n  went to a reception given by the "Metropolitan Club."... It is\r\n  sometimes called the "Millionaires\' Club." The building is\r\n  magnificent, being built of white marble; the rooms are large and\r\n  splendidly furnished; but I must confess, so much splendor is\r\n  rather oppressive to me; and I didn\'t envy the millionaires in\r\n  the least all the happiness their gorgeous surroundings are\r\n  supposed to bring them....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. KATE ADAMS KELLER\r\n  New York, March 31, 1895.\r\n  ...Teacher and I spent the afternoon at Mr. Hutton\'s, and had a\r\n  most delightful time!... We met Mr. Clemens and Mr. Howells\r\n  there! I had known about them for a long time; but I had never\r\n  thought that I should see them, and talk to them; and I can\r\n  scarcely realize now that this great pleasure has been mine! But,\r\n  much as I wonder that I, only a little girl of fourteen, should\r\n  come in contact with so many distinguished people, I do realize\r\n  that I am a very happy child, and very grateful for the many\r\n  beautiful privileges I have enjoyed. The two distinguished\r\n  authors were very gentle and kind, and I could not tell which of\r\n  them I loved best. Mr. Clemens told us many entertaining stories,\r\n  and made us laugh till we cried. I only wish you could have seen\r\n  and heard him! He told us that he would go to Europe in a few\r\n  days to bring his wife and his daughter, Jeanne, back to America,\r\n  because Jeanne, who is studying in Paris, has learned so much in\r\n  three years and a half that if he did not bring her home, she\r\n  would soon know more than he did. I think Mark Twain is a very\r\n  appropriate nom de plume for Mr. Clemens because it has a funny\r\n  and quaint sound, and goes well with his amusing writings, and\r\n  its nautical significance suggests the deep and beautiful things\r\n  that he has written. I think he is very handsome indeed....\r\n  Teacher said she thought he looked something like Paradeuski. (If\r\n  that is the way to spell the name.) Mr. Howells told me a little\r\n  about Venice, which is one of his favorite cities, and spoke very\r\n  tenderly of his dear little girl, Winnifred, who is now with God.\r\n  He has another daughter, named Mildred, who knows Carrie. I might\r\n  have seen Mrs. Wiggin, the sweet author of "Birds\' Christmas\r\n  Carol," but she had a dangerous cough and could not come. I was\r\n  much disappointed not to see her, but I hope I shall have that\r\n  pleasure some other time. Mr. Hutton gave me a lovely little\r\n  glass, shaped like a thistle, which belonged to his dear mother,\r\n  as a souvenir of my delightful visit. We also met Mr. Rogers...\r\n  who kindly left his carriage to bring us home.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the Wright-Humason School closed for the summer, Miss\r\n  Sullivan and Helen went South.\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  Tuscumbia, Alabama, July 29, 1895.\r\n  ...I am spending my vacation very quietly and pleasantly at my\r\n  beautiful, sunny home, with my loving parents, my darling little\r\n  sister and my small brother, Phillips   My precious teacher is\r\n  with me too, and so of course I am happy I read a little, walk a\r\n  little, write a little and play with the children a great deal,\r\n  and the days slip by delightfully!...\r\n\r\n  My friends are so pleased with the improvement which I made in\r\n  speech and lip-reading last year, that it has been decided best\r\n  for me to continue my studies in New York another year I am\r\n  delighted at the prospect, of spending another year in your great\r\n  city I used to think that I should never feel "at home" in New\r\n  York, but since I have made the acquaintance of so many people,\r\n  and can look back to such a bright and successful winter there, I\r\n  find myself looking forward to next year, and anticipating still\r\n  brighter and better times in the Metropolis\r\n\r\n  Please give my kindest love to Mr Hutton, and Mrs Riggs and Mr\r\n  Warner too, although I have never had the pleasure of knowing him\r\n  personally As I listen Venicewards, I hear Mr Hutton\'s pen\r\n  dancing over the pages of his new book It is a pleasant sound\r\n  because it is full of promise How much I shall enjoy reading it!\r\n\r\n  Please pardon me, my dear Mrs Hutton, for sending you a\r\n  typewritten letter across the ocean  I have tried several times\r\n  to write with a pencil on my little writing machine since I came\r\n  home; but I have found it very difficult to do so on account of\r\n  the heat  The moisture of my hand soils and blurs the paper so\r\n  dreadfully, that I am compelled to use my typewriter altogether\r\n  And it is not my "Remington" either, but a naughty little thing\r\n  that gets out of order on the slightest provocation, and cannot\r\n  be induced to make a period...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. WILLIAM THAW\r\n  New York, October 16, 1895.\r\n  Here we are once more in the great metropolis! We left Hulton\r\n  Friday night and arrived here Saturday morning. Our friends were\r\n  greatly surprised to see us, as they had not expected us before\r\n  the last of this month. I rested Saturday afternoon, for I was\r\n  very tired, and Sunday I visited with my schoolmates, and now\r\n  that I feel quite rested, I am going to write to you; for I know\r\n  you will want to hear that we reached New York safely. We had to\r\n  change cars at Philadelphia; but we did not mind it much. After\r\n  we had had our breakfast, Teacher asked one of the train-men in\r\n  the station if the New York train was made up. He said no, it\r\n  would not be called for about fifteen minutes; so we sat down to\r\n  wait; but in a moment the man came back and asked Teacher if we\r\n  would like to go to the train at once. She said we would, and he\r\n  took us way out on the track and put us on board our train. Thus\r\n  we avoided the rush and had a nice quiet visit before the train\r\n  started. Was that not very kind? So it always is. Some one is\r\n  ever ready to scatter little acts of kindness along our pathway,\r\n  making it smooth and pleasant...\r\n\r\n  We had a quiet but very pleasant time in Hulton. Mr. Wade is just\r\n  as dear and good as ever! He has lately had several books printed\r\n  in England for me, "Old Mortality," "The Castle of Otranto" and\r\n  "King of No-land."...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  New York, December 29, 1895.\r\n  ...Teacher and I have been very gay of late. We have seen our\r\n  kind friends, Mrs. Dodge, Mr. and Mrs. Hutton, Mrs. Riggs and her\r\n  husband, and met many distinguished people, among whom were Miss\r\n  Ellen Terry, Sir Henry Irving and Mr. Stockton! Weren\'t we very\r\n  fortunate? Miss Terry was lovely. She kissed Teacher and said, "I\r\n  do not know whether I am glad to see you or not; for I feel so\r\n  ashamed of myself when I think of how much you have done for the\r\n  little girl." We also met Mr. and Mrs. Terry, Miss Terry\'s\r\n  brother and his wife. I thought her beauty angellic, and oh, what\r\n  a clear, beautiful voice she had! We saw Miss Terry again with\r\n  Sir Henry in "King Charles the First," a week ago last Friday,\r\n  and after the play they kindly let me feel of them and get an\r\n  idea of how they looked. How noble and kingly the King was,\r\n  especially in his misfortunes! And how pretty and faithful the\r\n  poor Queen was! The play seemed so real, we almost forgot where\r\n  we were, and believed we were watching the genuine scenes as they\r\n  were acted so long ago. The last act affected us most deeply, and\r\n  we all wept, wondering how the executioner could have the heart\r\n  to tear the King from his loving wife\'s arms.\r\n\r\n  I have just finished reading "Ivanhoe." It was very exciting; but\r\n  I must say I did not enjoy it very much. Sweet Rebecca, with her\r\n  strong, brave spirit, and her pure, generous nature, was the only\r\n  character which thoroughly won my admiration. Now I am reading\r\n  "Stories from Scottish History," and they are very thrilling and\r\n  absorbing!...\r\n\r\n\r\n  The next two letters were written just after the death of Mr.\r\n  John P. Spaulding.\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. GEORGE H. BRADFORD\r\n  New York, February 4, 1896.\r\n  What can I say which will make you understand how much Teacher\r\n  and I appreciate your thoughtful kindness in sending us those\r\n  little souvenirs of the dear room where we first met the best and\r\n  kindest of friends? Indeed, you can never know all the comfort\r\n  you have given us. We have put the dear picture on the\r\n  mantel-piece in our room where we can see it every day, and I\r\n  often go and touch it, and somehow I cannot help feeling that our\r\n  beloved friend is very near to me.... It was very hard to take up\r\n  our school work again, as if nothing had happened; but I am sure\r\n  it is well that we have duties which must be done, and which take\r\n  our minds away for a time at least from our sorrow....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  New York, March 2nd, 1896.\r\n  ...We miss dear King John sadly. It was so hard to lose him, he\r\n  was the best and kindest of friends, and I do not know what we\r\n  shall do without him....\r\n\r\n  We went to a poultry-show... and the man there kindly permitted\r\n  us to feel of the birds. They were so tame, they stood perfectly\r\n  still when I handled them. I saw great big turkeys, geese,\r\n  guineas, ducks and many others.\r\n\r\n  Almost two weeks ago we called at Mr. Hutton\'s and had a\r\n  delightful time. We always do! We met Mr. Warner, the writer, Mr.\r\n  Mabie, the editor of the Outlook and other pleasant people. I am\r\n  sure you would like to know Mr. and Mrs. Hutton, they are so kind\r\n  and interesting. I can never tell you how much pleasure they have\r\n  given us.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Warner and Mr. Burroughs, the great lover of nature, came to\r\n  see us a few days after, and we had a delightful talk with them.\r\n  They were both very, very dear! Mr. Burroughs told me about his\r\n  home near the Hudson, and what a happy place it must be! I hope\r\n  we shall visit it some day. Teacher has read me his lively\r\n  stories about his boyhood, and I enjoyed them greatly. Have you\r\n  read the beautiful poem, "Waiting"? I know it, and it makes me\r\n  feel so happy, it has such sweet thoughts. Mr. Warner showed me a\r\n  scarf-pin with a beetle on it which was made in Egypt fifteen\r\n  hundred years before Christ, and told me that the beetle meant\r\n  immortality to the Egyptians because it wrapped itself up and\r\n  went to sleep and came out again in a new form, thus renewing\r\n  itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  New York, April 25, 1896.\r\n  ...My studies are the same as they were when I saw you, except\r\n  that I have taken up French with a French teacher who comes three\r\n  times a week. I read her lips almost exclusively, (she does not\r\n  know the manual alphabet) and we get on quite well. I have read\r\n  "Le Medecin Malgre Lui," a very good French comedy by Moliere,\r\n  with pleasure; and they say I speak French pretty well now, and\r\n  German also. Anyway, French and German people understand what I\r\n  am trying to say, and that is very encouraging. In voice-training\r\n  I have still the same old difficulties to contend against; and\r\n  the fulfilment of my wish to speak well seems O, so far away!\r\n  Sometimes I feel sure that I catch a faint glimpse of the goal I\r\n  am striving for, but in another minute a bend in the road hides\r\n  it from my view, and I am again left wandering in the dark! But I\r\n  try hard not to be discouraged. Surely we shall all find at last\r\n  the ideals we are seeking....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN HITZ\r\n  Brewster, Mass. July 15, 1896.\r\n  ...As to the book, I am sure I shall enjoy it very much when I am\r\n  admitted, by the magic of Teacher\'s dear fingers, into the\r\n  companionship of the two sisters who went to the Immortal\r\n  Fountain.\r\n\r\n  As I sit by the window writing to you, it is so lovely to have\r\n  the soft, cool breezes fan my cheek and to feel that the hard\r\n  work of last year is over! Teacher seems to feel benefitted by\r\n  the change too; for she is already beginning to look like her\r\n  dear old self. We only need you, dear Mr. Hitz, to complete our\r\n  happiness. Teacher and Mrs. Hopkins both say you must come as\r\n  soon as you can! We will try to make you comfortable.\r\n\r\n  Teacher and I spent nine days at Philadelphia. Have you ever been\r\n  at Dr. Crouter\'s Institution? Mr. Howes has probably given you a\r\n  full account of our doings. We were busy all the time; we\r\n  attended the meetings and talked with hundreds of people, among\r\n  whom were dear Dr. Bell, Mr. Banerji of Calcutta, Monsieur Magnat\r\n  of Paris with whom I conversed in French exclusively, and many\r\n  other distinguished persons. We had looked forward to seeing you\r\n  there, and so we were greatly disappointed that you did not come.\r\n  We think of you so, so often! and our hearts go out to you in\r\n  tenderest sympathy; and you know better than this poor letter can\r\n  tell you how happy we always are to have you with us! I made a\r\n  "speech" on July eighth, telling the members of the Association\r\n  what an unspeakable blessing speech has been to me, and urging\r\n  them to give every little deaf child an opportunity to learn to\r\n  speak. Every one said I spoke very well and intelligibly. After\r\n  my little "speech," we attended a reception at which over six\r\n  hundred people were present. I must confess I do not like such\r\n  large receptions; the people crowd so, and we have to do so much\r\n  talking; and yet it is at receptions like the one in Philadelphia\r\n  that we often meet friends whom we learn to love afterwards. We\r\n  left the city last Thursday night, and arrived in Brewster Friday\r\n  afternoon. We missed the Cape Cod train Friday morning, and so we\r\n  came down to Provincetown in the steamer Longfellow. I am glad we\r\n  did so; for it was lovely and cool on the water, and Boston\r\n  Harbor is always interesting.\r\n\r\n  We spent about three weeks in Boston, after leaving New York, and\r\n  I need not tell you we had a most delightful time. We visited our\r\n  good friends, Mr. and Mrs. Chamberlin, at Wrentham, out in the\r\n  country, where they have a lovely home. Their house stands near a\r\n  charming lake where we went boating and canoeing, which was great\r\n  fun. We also went in bathing several times. Mr. and Mrs.\r\n  Chamberlin celebrated the 17th of June by giving a picnic to\r\n  their literary friends. There were about forty persons present,\r\n  all of whom were writers and publishers. Our friend, Mr. Alden,\r\n  the editor of Harper\'s was there, and of course we enjoyed his\r\n  society very much....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER\r\n  Brewster, Mass., September 3, 1896.\r\n  ...I have been meaning to write to you all summer; there were\r\n  many things I wanted to tell you, and I thought perhaps you would\r\n  like to hear about our vacation by the seaside, and our plans for\r\n  next year; but the happy, idle days slipped away so quickly, and\r\n  there were so many pleasant things to do every moment, that I\r\n  never found time to clothe my thought in words, and send them to\r\n  you. I wonder what becomes of lost opportunities. Perhaps our\r\n  guardian angel gathers them up as we drop them, and will give\r\n  them back to us in the beautiful sometime when we have grown\r\n  wiser, and learned how to use them rightly. But, however this may\r\n  be, I cannot now write the letter which has lain in my thought\r\n  for you so long. My heart is too full of sadness to dwell upon\r\n  the happiness the summer has brought me. My father is dead. He\r\n  died last Saturday at my home in Tuscumbia, and I was not there.\r\n  My own dear loving father! Oh, dear friend, how shall I ever bear\r\n  it!...\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the first of October Miss Keller entered the Cambridge School\r\n  for Young Ladies, of which Mr. Arthur Gilman is Principal. The\r\n  "examinations" mentioned in this letter were merely tests given\r\n  in the school, but as they were old Harvard papers, it is evident\r\n  that in some subjects Miss Keller was already fairly well\r\n  prepared for Radcliffe.\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  37 Concord Avenue, Cambridge, Mass.\r\n  October 8, 1896.\r\n  ...I got up early this morning, so that I could write you a few\r\n  lines. I know you want to hear how I like my school. I do wish\r\n  you could come and see for yourself what a beautiful school it\r\n  is! There are about a hundred girls, and they are all so bright\r\n  and happy; it is a joy to be with them.\r\n\r\n  You will be glad to hear that I passed my examinations\r\n  successfully. I have been examined in English, German, French,\r\n  and Greek and Roman history. They were the entrance examinations\r\n  for Harvard College; so I feel pleased to think I could pass\r\n  them. This year is going to be a very busy one for Teacher and\r\n  myself. I am studying Arithmetic, English Literature, English\r\n  History, German, Latin, and advanced geography; there is a great\r\n  deal of preparatory reading required, and, as few of the books\r\n  are in raised print, poor Teacher has to spell them all out to\r\n  me; and that means hard work.\r\n\r\n  You must tell Mr. Howells when you see him, that we are living in\r\n  his house....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. WILLIAM THAW\r\n  37 Concord Avenue, Cambridge, Mass.,\r\n  December 2, 1896.\r\n  ...It takes me a long time to prepare my lessons, because I have\r\n  to have every word of them spelled out in my hand. Not one of the\r\n  textbooks which I am obliged to use is in raised print; so of\r\n  course my work is harder than it would be if I could read my\r\n  lessons over by myself. But it is harder for Teacher than it is\r\n  for me because the strain on her poor eyes is so great, and I\r\n  cannot help worrying about them. Sometimes it really seems as if\r\n  the task which we have set ourselves were more than we can\r\n  accomplish; but at other times I enjoy my work more than I can\r\n  say.\r\n\r\n  It is such a delight to be with the other girls, and do\r\n  everything that they do. I study Latin, German, Arithmetic and\r\n  English History, all of which I enjoy except Arithmetic. I am\r\n  afraid I have not a mathematical mind; for my figures always\r\n  manage to get into the wrong places!...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  Cambridge, Mass., May 3, 1897.\r\n  ...You know I am trying very hard to get through with the reading\r\n  for the examinations in June, and this, in addition to my regular\r\n  schoolwork keeps me awfully busy. But Johnson, and "The Plague"\r\n  and everything else must wait a few minutes this afternoon, while\r\n  I say, thank you, my dear Mrs. Hutton....\r\n\r\n  ...What a splendid time we had at the "Players\' Club." I always\r\n  thought clubs were dull, smoky places, where men talked politics,\r\n  and told endless stories, all about themselves and their\r\n  wonderful exploits: but now I see, I must have been quite\r\n  wrong....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN HITZ\r\n  Wrentham, Mass. July 9, 1897.\r\n  ...Teacher and I are going to spend the summer at Wrentham, Mass.\r\n  with our friends, the Chamberlins. I think you remember Mr.\r\n  Chamberlin, the "Listener" in the Boston Transcript. They are\r\n  dear, kind people....\r\n\r\n  But I know you want to hear about my examinations. I know that\r\n  you will be glad to hear that I passed all of them successfully.\r\n  The subjects I offered were elementary and advanced German,\r\n  French, Latin, English, and Greek and Roman History. It seems\r\n  almost too good to be true, does it not? All the time I was\r\n  preparing for the great ordeal, I could not suppress an inward\r\n  fear and trembling lest I should fail, and now it is an\r\n  unspeakable relief to know that I have passed the examinations\r\n  with credit. But what I consider my crown of success is the\r\n  happiness and pleasure that my victory has brought dear Teacher.\r\n  Indeed, I feel that the success is hers more than mine; for she\r\n  is my constant inspiration....\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the end of September Miss Sullivan and Miss Keller returned to\r\n  the Cambridge School, where they remained until early in\r\n  December. Then the interference of Mr. Gilman resulted in Mrs.\r\n  Keller\'s withdrawing Miss Helen and her sister, Miss Mildred,\r\n  from the school. Miss Sullivan and her pupil went to Wrentham,\r\n  where they worked under Mr. Merton S. Keith, an enthusiastic and\r\n  skilful teacher.\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  Wrentham, February 20, 1898.\r\n  ...I resumed my studies soon after your departure, and in a very\r\n  little while we were working as merrily as if the dreadful\r\n  experience of a month ago had been but a dream. I cannot tell you\r\n  how much I enjoy the country. It is so fresh, and peaceful and\r\n  free! I do think I could work all day long without feeling tired\r\n  if they would let me. There are so many pleasant things to\r\n  do--not always very easy things,--much of my work in Algebra and\r\n  Geometry is hard: but I love it all, especially Greek. Just\r\n  think, I shall soon finish my grammar! Then comes the "Iliad."\r\n  What an inexpressible joy it will be to read about Achilles, and\r\n  Ulysses, and Andromache and Athene, and the rest of my old\r\n  friends in their own glorious language! I think Greek is the\r\n  loveliest language that I know anything about. If it is true that\r\n  the violin is the most perfect of musical instruments, then Greek\r\n  is the violin of human thought.\r\n\r\n  We have had some splendid toboganning this month. Every morning,\r\n  before lesson-time, we all go out to the steep hill on the\r\n  northern shore of the lake near the house, and coast for an hour\r\n  or so. Some one balances the toboggan on the very crest of the\r\n  hill, while we get on, and when we are ready, off we dash down\r\n  the side of the hill in a headlong rush, and, leaping a\r\n  projection, plunge into a snow-drift and go swimming far across\r\n  the pond at a tremendous rate!...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  [Wrentham] April 12, 1898.\r\n  ...I am glad Mr. Keith is so well pleased with my progress. It is\r\n  true that Algebra and Geometry are growing easier all the time,\r\n  especially algebra; and I have just received books in raised\r\n  print which will greatly facilitate my work....\r\n\r\n  I find I get on faster, and do better work with Mr. Keith than I\r\n  did in the classes at the Cambridge School, and I think it was\r\n  well that I gave up that kind of work. At any rate, I have not\r\n  been idle since I left school; I have accomplished more, and been\r\n  happier than I could have been there....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  [Wrentham] May 29, 1898.\r\n  ...My work goes on bravely. Each day is filled to the brim with\r\n  hard study; for I am anxious to accomplish as much as possible\r\n  before I put away my books for the summer vacation. You will be\r\n  pleased to hear that I did three problems in Geometry yesterday\r\n  without assistance. Mr. Keith and Teacher were quite enthusiastic\r\n  over the achievement, and I must confess, I felt somewhat elated\r\n  myself. Now I feel as if I should succeed in doing something in\r\n  mathematics, although I cannot see why it is so very important to\r\n  know that the lines drawn from the extremities of the base of an\r\n  isosceles triangle to the middle points of the opposite sides are\r\n  equal! The knowledge doesn\'t make life any sweeter or happier,\r\n  does it? On the other hand, when we learn a new word, it is the\r\n  key to untold treasures....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER\r\n  Wrentham, Mass., June 7, 1898.\r\n  I am afraid you will conclude that I am not very anxious for a\r\n  tandem after all, since I have let nearly a week pass without\r\n  answering your letter in regard to the kind of wheel I should\r\n  like. But really, I have been so constantly occupied with my\r\n  studies since we returned from New York, that I have not had time\r\n  even to think of the fun it would be to have a bicycle! You see,\r\n  I am anxious to accomplish as much as possible before the long\r\n  summer vacation begins. I am glad, though, that it is nearly time\r\n  to put away my books; for the sunshine and flowers, and the\r\n  lovely lake in front of our house are doing their best to tempt\r\n  me away from my Greek and Mathematics, especially from the\r\n  latter! I am sure the daisies and buttercups have as little use\r\n  for the science of Geometry as I, in spite of the fact that they\r\n  so beautifully illustrate its principles.\r\n\r\n  But bless me, I mustn\'t forget the tandem! The truth is, I know\r\n  very little about bicycles. I have only ridden a "sociable,"\r\n  which is very different from the ordinary tandem. The "sociable"\r\n  is safer, perhaps, than the tandem; but it is very heavy and\r\n  awkward, and has a way of taking up the greater part of the road.\r\n  Besides, I have been told that "sociables" cost more than other\r\n  kinds of bicycles. My teacher and other friends think I could\r\n  ride a Columbia tandem in the country with perfect safety. They\r\n  also think your suggestion about a fixed handlebar a good one. I\r\n  ride with a divided skirt, and so does my teacher; but it would\r\n  be easier for her to mount a man\'s wheel than for me; so, if it\r\n  could be arranged to have the ladies\' seat behind, I think it\r\n  would be better....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY\r\n  Wrentham, September 11, 1898.\r\n  ...I am out of doors all the time, rowing, swimming, riding and\r\n  doing a multitude of other pleasant things. This morning I rode\r\n  over twelve miles on my tandem! I rode on a rough road, and fell\r\n  off three or four times, and am now awfully lame! But the weather\r\n  and the scenery were so beautiful, and it was such fun to go\r\n  scooting over the smoother part of the road, I didn\'t mind the\r\n  mishaps in the least.\r\n\r\n  I have really learned to swim and dive--after a fashion! I can\r\n  swim a little under water, and do almost anything I like, without\r\n  fear of getting drowned! Isn\'t that fine? It is almost no effort\r\n  for me to row around the lake, no matter how heavy the load may\r\n  be. So you can well imagine how strong and brown I am....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  12 Newbury Street, Boston,\r\n  October 23, 1898.\r\n  This is the first opportunity I have had to write to you since we\r\n  came here last Monday. We have been in such a whirl ever since we\r\n  decided to come to Boston; it seemed as if we should never get\r\n  settled. Poor Teacher has had her hands full, attending to\r\n  movers, and express-men, and all sorts of people. I wish it were\r\n  not such a bother to move, especially as we have to do it so\r\n  often!...\r\n\r\n  ...Mr. Keith comes here at half past three every day except\r\n  Saturday. He says he prefers to come here for the present. I am\r\n  reading the "Iliad," and the "Aeneid" and Cicero, besides doing a\r\n  lot in Geometry and Algebra. The "Iliad" is beautiful with all\r\n  the truth, and grace and simplicity of a wonderfully childlike\r\n  people while the "Aeneid" is more stately and reserved. It is\r\n  like a beautiful maiden, who always lived in a palace, surrounded\r\n  by a magnificent court; while the "Iliad" is like a splendid\r\n  youth, who has had the earth for his playground.\r\n\r\n  The weather has been awfully dismal all the week; but to-day is\r\n  beautiful, and our room floor is flooded with sunlight. By and by\r\n  we shall take a little walk in the Public Gardens. I wish the\r\n  Wrentham woods were round the corner! But alas! they are not, and\r\n  I shall have to content myself with a stroll in the Gardens.\r\n  Somehow, after the great fields and pastures and lofty\r\n  pine-groves of the country, they seem shut-in and conventional.\r\n  Even the trees seem citified and self-conscious. Indeed, I doubt\r\n  if they are on speaking terms with their country cousins! Do you\r\n  know, I cannot help feeling sorry for these trees with all their\r\n  fashionable airs? They are like the people whom they see every\r\n  day, who prefer the crowded, noisy city to the quiet and freedom\r\n  of the country. They do not even suspect how circumscribed their\r\n  lives are. They look down pityingly on the country-folk, who have\r\n  never had an opportunity "to see the great world." Oh my! if they\r\n  only realized their limitations, they would flee for their lives\r\n  to the woods and fields. But what nonsense is this! You will\r\n  think I\'m pining away for my beloved Wrentham, which is true in\r\n  one sense and not in another. I do miss Red Farm and the dear\r\n  ones there dreadfully; but I am not unhappy. I have Teacher and\r\n  my books, and I have the certainty that something sweet and good\r\n  will come to me in this great city, where human beings struggle\r\n  so bravely all their lives to wring happiness from cruel\r\n  circumstances. Anyway, I am glad to have my share in life,\r\n  whether it be bright or sad....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. WILLIAM THAW\r\n  Boston, December 6th, 1898.\r\n  My teacher and I had a good laugh over the girls\' frolic. How\r\n  funny they must have looked in their "rough-rider" costumes,\r\n  mounted upon their fiery steeds! "Slim" would describe them, if\r\n  they were anything like the saw-horses I have seen. What jolly\r\n  times they must have at--! I cannot help wishing sometimes that\r\n  I could have some of the fun that other girls have. How quickly I\r\n  should lock up all these mighty warriors, and hoary sages, and\r\n  impossible heroes, who are now almost my only companions; and\r\n  dance and sing and frolic like other girls! But I must not waste\r\n  my time wishing idle wishes; and after all my ancient friends are\r\n  very wise and interesting, and I usually enjoy their society very\r\n  much indeed. It is only once in a great while that I feel\r\n  discontented, and allow myself to wish for things I cannot hope\r\n  for in this life. But, as you know, my heart is usually brimful\r\n  of happiness. The thought that my dear Heavenly Father is always\r\n  near, giving me abundantly of all those things, which truly\r\n  enrich life and make it sweet and beautiful, makes every\r\n  deprivation seem of little moment compared with the countless\r\n  blessings I enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MRS. WILLIAM THAW\r\n  12 Newbury Street, Boston,\r\n  December 19th, 1898.\r\n  ...I realize now what a selfish, greedy girl I was to ask that my\r\n  cup of happiness should be filled to overflowing, without\r\n  stopping to think how many other people\'s cups were quite empty.\r\n  I feel heartily ashamed of my thoughtlessness. One of the\r\n  childish illusions, which it has been hardest for me to get rid\r\n  of, is that we have only to make our wishes known in order to\r\n  have them granted. But I am slowly learning that there is not\r\n  happiness enough in the world for everyone to have all that he\r\n  wants; and it grieves me to think that I should have forgotten,\r\n  even for a moment, that I already have more than my share, and\r\n  that like poor little Oliver Twist I should have asked for\r\n  "more."...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  12 Newberry Street, Boston.\r\n  December 22, [1898]\r\n  ...I suppose Mr. Keith writes you the work-a-day news. If so, you\r\n  know that I have finished all the geometry, and nearly all the\r\n  Algebra required for the Harvard examinations, and after\r\n  Christmas I shall begin a very careful review of both subjects.\r\n  You will be glad to hear that I enjoy Mathematics now. Why, I can\r\n  do long, complicated quadratic equations in my head quite easily,\r\n  and it is great fun! I think Mr. Keith is a wonderful teacher,\r\n  and I feel very grateful to him for having made me see the beauty\r\n  of Mathematics. Next to my own dear teacher, he has done more\r\n  than any one else to enrich and broaden my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  12 Newbury Street, Boston,\r\n  January 17, 1899.\r\n  ...Have you seen Kipling\'s "Dreaming True," or "Kitchener\'s\r\n  School?" It is a very strong poem and set me dreaming too. Of\r\n  course you have read about the "Gordon Memorial College," which\r\n  the English people are to erect at Khartoum. While I was thinking\r\n  over the blessings that would come to the people of Egypt through\r\n  this college, and eventually to England herself, there came into\r\n  my heart the strong desire that my own dear country should in a\r\n  similar way convert the terrible loss of her brave sons on the\r\n  "Maine" into a like blessing to the people of Cuba. Would a\r\n  college at Havana not be the noblest and most enduring monument\r\n  that could be raised to the brave men of the "Maine," as well as\r\n  a source of infinite good to all concerned? Imagine entering the\r\n  Havana harbor, and having the pier, where the "Maine" was\r\n  anchored on that dreadful night, when she was so mysteriously\r\n  destroyed, pointed out to you, and being told that the great,\r\n  beautiful building overlooking the spot was the "Maine Memorial\r\n  College," erected by the American people, and having for its\r\n  object the education both of Cubans and Spaniards! What a\r\n  glorious triumph such a monument would be of the best and highest\r\n  instincts of a Christian nation! In it there would be no\r\n  suggestion of hatred or revenge, nor a trace of the old-time\r\n  belief that might makes right. On the other hand, it would be a\r\n  pledge to the world that we intend to stand by our declaration of\r\n  war, and give Cuba to the Cubans, as soon as we have fitted them\r\n  to assume the duties and responsibilities of a self-governing\r\n  people....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN HITZ\r\n  12 Newbury Street, Boston,\r\n  February 3, 1899.\r\n  ...I had an exceedingly interesting experience last Monday. A\r\n  kind friend took me over in the morning to the Boston Art Museum.\r\n  She had previously obtained permission from General Loring, Supt.\r\n  of the Museum, for me to touch the statues, especially those\r\n  which represented my old friends in the "Iliad" and "Aeneid." Was\r\n  that not lovely? While I was there, General Loring himself came\r\n  in, and showed me some of the most beautiful statues, among which\r\n  were the Venus of Medici, the Minerva of the Parthenon, Diana, in\r\n  her hunting costume, with her hand on the quiver and a doe by her\r\n  side, and the unfortunate Laocoon and his two little sons,\r\n  struggling in the fearful coils of two huge serpents, and\r\n  stretching their arms to the skies with heart-rending cries. I\r\n  also saw Apollo Belvidere. He had just slain the Python and was\r\n  standing by a great pillar of rock, extending his graceful hand\r\n  in triumph over the terrible snake. Oh, he was simply beautiful!\r\n  Venus entranced me. She looked as if she had just risen from the\r\n  foam of the sea, and her loveliness was like a strain of heavenly\r\n  music. I also saw poor Niobe with her youngest child clinging\r\n  close to her while she implored the cruel goddess not to kill her\r\n  last darling. I almost cried, it was all so real and tragic.\r\n  General Loring kindly showed me a copy of one of the wonderful\r\n  bronze doors of the Baptistry of Florence, and I felt of the\r\n  graceful pillars, resting on the backs of fierce lions. So you\r\n  see, I had a foretaste of the pleasure which I hope some day to\r\n  have of visiting Florence. My friend said, she would sometime\r\n  show me the copies of the marbles brought away by Lord Elgin from\r\n  the Parthenon. But somehow, I should prefer to see the originals\r\n  in the place where Genius meant them to remain, not only as a\r\n  hymn of praise to the gods, but also as a monument of the glory\r\n  of Greece. It really seems wrong to snatch such sacred things\r\n  away from the sanctuary of the Past where they belong....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. WILLIAM WADE\r\n  Boston, February 19th, 1899.\r\n  Why, bless you, I thought I wrote to you the day after the\r\n  "Eclogues" arrived, and told you how glad I was to have them!\r\n  Perhaps you never got that letter. At any rate, I thank you, dear\r\n  friend, for taking such a world of trouble for me. You will be\r\n  glad to hear that the books from England are coming now. I\r\n  already have the seventh and eighth books of the "Aeneid" and one\r\n  book of the "Iliad," all of which is most fortunate, as I have\r\n  come almost to the end of my embossed text-books.\r\n\r\n  It gives me great pleasure to hear how much is being done for the\r\n  deaf-blind. The more I learn of them, the more kindness I find.\r\n  Why, only a little while ago people thought it quite impossible\r\n  to teach the deaf-blind anything; but no sooner was it proved\r\n  possible than hundreds of kind, sympathetic hearts were fired\r\n  with the desire to help them, and now we see how many of those\r\n  poor, unfortunate persons are being taught to see the beauty and\r\n  reality of life. Love always finds its way to an imprisoned soul,\r\n  and leads it out into the world of freedom and intelligence!\r\n\r\n  As to the two-handed alphabet, I think it is much easier for\r\n  those who have sight than the manual alphabet; for most of the\r\n  letters look like the large capitals in books; but I think when\r\n  it comes to teaching a deaf-blind person to spell, the manual\r\n  alphabet is much more convenient, and less conspicuous....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  12 Newbury Street, Boston,\r\n  March 5, 1899.\r\n  ...I am now sure that I shall be ready for my examinations in\r\n  June. There is but one cloud in my sky at present; but that is\r\n  one which casts a dark shadow over my life, and makes me very\r\n  anxious at times. My teacher\'s eyes are no better: indeed, I\r\n  think they grow more troublesome, though she is very brave and\r\n  patient, and will not give up. But it is most distressing to me\r\n  to feel that she is sacrificing her sight for me. I feel as if I\r\n  ought to give up the idea of going to college altogether: for not\r\n  all the knowledge in the world could make me happy, if obtained\r\n  at such a cost. I do wish, Mrs. Hutton, you would try to persuade\r\n  Teacher to take a rest, and have her eyes treated. She will not\r\n  listen to me.\r\n\r\n  I have just had some pictures taken, and if they are good, I\r\n  would like to send one to Mr. Rogers, if you think he would like\r\n  to have it. I would like so much to show him in some way how\r\n  deeply I appreciate all that he is doing for me, and I cannot\r\n  think of anything better to do.\r\n\r\n  Every one here is talking about the Sargent pictures. It is a\r\n  wonderful exhibition of portraits, they say. How I wish I had\r\n  eyes to see them! How I should delight in their beauty and color!\r\n  However, I am glad that I am not debarred from all pleasure in\r\n  the pictures. I have at least the satisfaction of seeing them\r\n  through the eyes of my friends, which is a real pleasure. I am so\r\n  thankful that I can rejoice in the beauties, which my friends\r\n  gather and put into my hands!\r\n\r\n  We are all so glad and thankful that Mr. Kipling did not die! I\r\n  have his "Jungle-Book" in raised print, and what a splendid,\r\n  refreshing book it is! I cannot help feeling as if I knew its\r\n  gifted author. What a real, manly, lovable nature his must be!...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO DR. DAVID H. GREER\r\n  12 Newbury Street, Boston,\r\n  May 8, 1899.\r\n  ...Each day brings me all that I can possibly accomplish, and\r\n  each night brings me rest, and the sweet thought that I am a\r\n  little nearer to my goal than ever before. My Greek progresses\r\n  finely. I have finished the ninth book of the "Iliad" and am just\r\n  beginning the "Odyssey." I am also reading the "Aeneid" and the\r\n  "Eclogues." Some of my friends tell me that I am very foolish to\r\n  give so much time to Greek and Latin; but I am sure they would\r\n  not think so, if they realized what a wonderful world of\r\n  experience and thought Homer and Virgil have opened up to me. I\r\n  think I shall enjoy the "Odyssey" most of all. The "Iliad" tells\r\n  of almost nothing but war, and one sometimes wearies of the clash\r\n  of spears and the din of battle; but the "Odyssey" tells of\r\n  nobler courage--the courage of a soul sore tried, but steadfast\r\n  to the end. I often wonder, as I read these splendid poems why,\r\n  at the same time that Homer\'s songs of war fired the Greeks with\r\n  valor, his songs of manly virtue did not have a stronger\r\n  influence upon the spiritual life of the people. Perhaps the\r\n  reason is, that thoughts truly great are like seeds cast into the\r\n  human mind, and either lie there unnoticed, or are tossed about\r\n  and played with, like toys, until, grown wise through suffering\r\n  and experience, a race discovers and cultivates them. Then the\r\n  world has advanced one step in its heavenward march.\r\n\r\n  I am working very hard just now. I intend to take my examinations\r\n  in June, and there is a great deal to be done, before I shall\r\n  feel ready to meet the ordeal....\r\n\r\n  You will be glad to hear that my mother, and little sister and\r\n  brother are coming north to spend this summer with me. We shall\r\n  all live together in a small cottage on one of the lakes at\r\n  Wrentham, while my dear teacher takes a much needed rest. She has\r\n  not had a vacation for twelve years, think of it, and all that\r\n  time she has been the sunshine of my life. Now her eyes are\r\n  troubling her a great deal, and we all think she ought to be\r\n  relieved, for a while, of every care and responsibility. But we\r\n  shall not be quite separated; we shall see each other every day,\r\n  I hope. And, when July comes, you can think of me as rowing my\r\n  dear ones around the lovely lake in the little boat you gave me,\r\n  the happiest girl in the world!...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  [Boston] May 28th [1899].\r\n  ...We have had a hard day. Mr. Keith was here for three hours\r\n  this afternoon, pouring a torrent of Latin and Greek into my poor\r\n  bewildered brain. I really believe he knows more Latin and Greek\r\n  Grammar than Cicero or Homer ever dreamed of! Cicero is splendid,\r\n  but his orations are very difficult to translate. I feel ashamed\r\n  sometimes, when I make that eloquent man say what sounds absurd\r\n  or insipid; but how is a school-girl to interpret such genius?\r\n  Why, I should have to be a Cicero to talk like a Cicero!...\r\n\r\n\r\n  Linnie Haguewood is a deaf-blind girl, one of the many whom Mr.\r\n  William Wade has helped. She is being educated by Miss Dora\r\n  Donald who, at the beginning of her work with her pupil, was\r\n  supplied by Mr. Hitz, Superintendent of the Volta Bureau, with\r\n  copies of all documents relating to Miss Sullivan\'s work with\r\n  Miss Keller.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. WILLIAM WADE\r\n  Wrentham, Mass., June 5, 1899.\r\n  ...Linnie Haguewood\'s letter, which you sent me some weeks ago,\r\n  interested me very much. It seemed to show spontaneity and great\r\n  sweetness of character. I was a good deal amused by what she said\r\n  about history. I am sorry she does not enjoy it; but I too feel\r\n  sometimes how dark, and mysterious and even fearful the history\r\n  of old peoples, old religions and old forms of government really\r\n  is.\r\n\r\n  Well, I must confess, I do not like the sign-language, and I do\r\n  not think it would be of much use to the deaf-blind. I find it\r\n  very difficult to follow the rapid motions made by the\r\n  deaf-mutes, and besides, signs seem a great hindrance to them in\r\n  acquiring the power of using language easily and freely. Why, I\r\n  find it hard to understand them sometimes when they spell on\r\n  their fingers. On the whole, if they cannot be taught\r\n  articulation, the manual alphabet seems the best and most\r\n  convenient means of communication. At any rate, I am sure the\r\n  deaf-blind cannot learn to use signs with any degree of facility.\r\n\r\n  The other day, I met a deaf Norwegian gentleman, who knows\r\n  Ragnhild Kaata and her teacher very well, and we had a very\r\n  interesting conversation about her. He said she was very\r\n  industrious and happy. She spins, and does a great deal of fancy\r\n  work, and reads, and leads a pleasant, useful life. Just think,\r\n  she cannot use the manual alphabet! She reads the lips well, and\r\n  if she cannot understand a phrase, her friends write it in her\r\n  hand, and in this way she converses with strangers. I cannot make\r\n  out anything written in my hand, so you see, Ragnhild has got\r\n  ahead of me in some things. I do hope I shall see her sometime...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  Wrentham, July 29, 1899.\r\n  ...I passed in all the subjects I offered, and with credit in\r\n  advanced Latin.... But I must confess, I had a hard time on the\r\n  second day of my examinations. They would not allow Teacher to\r\n  read any of the papers to me; so the papers were copied for me in\r\n  braille. This arrangement worked very well in the languages, but\r\n  not nearly so well in the Mathematics. Consequently, I did not do\r\n  so well as I should have done, if Teacher had been allowed to\r\n  read the Algebra and Geometry to me. But you must not think I\r\n  blame any one. Of course they did not realize how difficult and\r\n  perplexing they were making the examinations for me. How could\r\n  they--they can see and hear, and I suppose they could not\r\n  understand matters from my point of view....\r\n\r\n  Thus far my summer has been sweeter than anything I can remember.\r\n  My mother, and sister and little brother have been here five\r\n  weeks, and our happiness knows no bounds. Not only do we enjoy\r\n  being together; but we also find our little home most delightful.\r\n  I do wish you could see the view of the beautiful lake from our\r\n  piazza, the islands looking like little emerald peaks in the\r\n  golden sunlight, and the canoes flitting here and there, like\r\n  autumn leaves in the gentle breeze, and breathe in the peculiarly\r\n  delicious fragrance of the woods, which comes like a murmur from\r\n  an unknown clime. I cannot help wondering if it is the same\r\n  fragrance that greeted the Norsemen long ago, when, according to\r\n  tradition, they visited our shores--an odorous echo of many\r\n  centuries of silent growth and decay in flower and tree....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. SAMUEL RICHARD FULLER\r\n  Wrentham, October 20, 1899.\r\n  ...I suppose it is time for me to tell you something about our\r\n  plans for the winter. You know it has long been my ambition to go\r\n  to Radcliffe, and receive a degree, as many other girls have\r\n  done; but Dean Irwin of Radcliffe, has persuaded me to take a\r\n  special course for the present. She said I had already shown the\r\n  world that I could do the college work, by passing all my\r\n  examinations successfully, in spite of many obstacles. She showed\r\n  me how very foolish it would be for me to pursue a four years\'\r\n  course of study at Radcliffe, simply to be like other girls, when\r\n  I might better be cultivating whatever ability I had for writing.\r\n  She said she did not consider a degree of any real value, but\r\n  thought it was much more desirable to do something original than\r\n  to waste one\'s energies only for a degree. Her arguments seemed\r\n  so wise and practical, that I could not but yield. I found it\r\n  hard, very hard, to give up the idea of going to college; it had\r\n  been in my mind ever since I was a little girl; but there is no\r\n  use doing a foolish thing, because one has wanted to do it a long\r\n  time, is there?\r\n\r\n  But, while we were discussing plans for the winter, a suggestion\r\n  which Dr. Hale had made long ago flashed across Teacher\'s\r\n  mind--that I might take courses somewhat like those offered at\r\n  Radcliffe, under the instruction of the professors in these\r\n  courses. Miss Irwin seemed to have no objection to this proposal,\r\n  and kindly offered to see the professors and find out if they\r\n  would give me lessons. If they will be so good as to teach me and\r\n  if we have money enough to do as we have planned, my studies this\r\n  year will be English, English Literature of the Elizabethan\r\n  period, Latin and German....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN HITZ\r\n  138 Brattle St., Cambridge,\r\n  Nov. 11, 1899.\r\n  ...As to the braille question, I cannot tell how deeply it\r\n  distresses me to hear that my statement with regard to the\r\n  examinations has been doubted. Ignorance seems to be at the\r\n  bottom of all these contradictions. Why, you yourself seem to\r\n  think that I taught you American braille, when you do not know a\r\n  single letter in the system! I could not help laughing when you\r\n  said you had been writing to me in American braille--and there\r\n  you were writing your letter in English braille!\r\n\r\n  The facts about the braille examinations are as follows:\r\n\r\n  How I passed my Entrance Examinations for Radcliffe College.\r\n\r\n  On the 29th and 30th of June, 1899, I took my examinations for\r\n  Radcliffe College. The first day I had elementary Greek and\r\n  advanced Latin, and the second day Geometry, Algebra and advanced\r\n  Greek.\r\n\r\n  The college authorities would not permit Miss Sullivan to read\r\n  the examination papers to me; so Mr. Eugene C. Vining, one of the\r\n  instructors at the Perkins Institution for the Blind, was\r\n  employed to copy the papers for me in braille. Mr. Vining was a\r\n  perfect stranger to me, and could not communicate with me except\r\n  by writing in braille. The Proctor also was a stranger, and did\r\n  not attempt to communicate with me in any way; and, as they were\r\n  both unfamiliar with my speech, they could not readily understand\r\n  what I said to them.\r\n\r\n  However, the braille worked well enough in the languages; but\r\n  when it came to Geometry and Algebra, it was different. I was\r\n  sorely perplexed, and felt quite discouraged, and wasted much\r\n  precious time, especially in Algebra. It is true that I am\r\n  perfectly familiar with all literary braille--English, American,\r\n  and New York Point; but the method of writing the various signs\r\n  used in Geometry and Algebra in the three systems is very\r\n  different, and two days before the examinations I knew only the\r\n  English method. I had used it all through my school work, and\r\n  never any other system.\r\n\r\n  In Geometry, my chief difficulty was, that I had always been\r\n  accustomed to reading the propositions in Line Print, or having\r\n  them spelled into my hand; and somehow, although the propositions\r\n  were right before me, yet the braille confused me, and I could\r\n  not fix in my mind clearly what I was reading. But, when I took\r\n  up Algebra, I had a harder time still--I was terribly handicapped\r\n  by my imperfect knowledge of the notation. The signs, which I had\r\n  learned the day before, and which I thought I knew perfectly,\r\n  confused me. Consequently my work was painfully slow, and I was\r\n  obliged to read the examples over and over before I could form a\r\n  clear idea what I was required to do. Indeed, I am not sure now\r\n  that I read all the signs correctly, especially as I was much\r\n  distressed, and found it very hard to keep my wits about me....\r\n\r\n  Now there is one more fact, which I wish to state very plainly,\r\n  in regard to what Mr. Gilman wrote to you. I never received any\r\n  direct instruction in the Gilman School. Miss Sullivan always sat\r\n  beside me, and told me what the teachers said. I did teach Miss\r\n  Hall, my teacher in Physics, how to write the American braille,\r\n  but she never gave me any instruction by means of it, unless a\r\n  few problems written for practice, which made me waste much\r\n  precious time deciphering them, can be called instruction. Dear\r\n  Frau Grote learned the manual alphabet, and used to teach me\r\n  herself; but this was in private lessons, which were paid for by\r\n  my friends. In the German class Miss Sullivan interpreted to me\r\n  as well as she could what the teacher said.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps, if you would send a copy of this to the head of the\r\n  Cambridge School, it might enlighten his mind on a few subjects,\r\n  on which he seems to be in total darkness just now....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS MILDRED KELLER\r\n  138 Brattle Street, Cambridge,\r\n  November 26, 1899.\r\n  ...At last we are settled for the winter, and our work is going\r\n  smoothly. Mr. Keith comes every afternoon at four o\'clock, and\r\n  gives me a "friendly lift" over the rough stretches of road, over\r\n  which every student must go. I am studying English history,\r\n  English literature, French and Latin, and by and by I shall take\r\n  up German and English composition--let us groan! You know, I\r\n  detest grammar as much as you do; but I suppose I must go through\r\n  it if I am to write, just as we had to get ducked in the lake\r\n  hundreds of times before we could swim! In French Teacher is\r\n  reading "Columba" to me. It is a delightful novel, full of\r\n  piquant expressions and thrilling adventures, (don\'t dare to\r\n  blame me for using big words, since you do the same!) and, if you\r\n  ever read it, I think you will enjoy it immensely. You are\r\n  studying English history, aren\'t you. O but it\'s exceedingly\r\n  interesting! I\'m making quite a thorough study of the Elizabethan\r\n  period--of the Reformation, and the Acts of Supremacy and\r\n  Conformity, and the maritime discoveries, and all the big things,\r\n  which the "deuce" seems to have invented to plague innocent\r\n  youngsters like yourself!...\r\n\r\n  Now we have a swell winter outfit--coats, hats, gowns, flannels\r\n  and all. We\'ve just had four lovely dresses made by a French\r\n  dressmaker. I have two, of which one has a black silk skirt, with\r\n  a black lace net over it, and a waist of white poplin, with\r\n  turquoise velvet and chiffon, and cream lace over a satin yoke.\r\n  The other is woollen, and of a very pretty green. The waist is\r\n  trimmed with pink and green brocaded velvet, and white lace, I\r\n  think, and has double reefers on the front, tucked and trimmed\r\n  with velvet, and also a row of tiny white buttons. Teacher too\r\n  has a silk dress. The skirt is black, while the waist is mostly\r\n  yellow, trimmed with delicate lavender chiffon, and black velvet\r\n  bows and lace. Her other dress is purple, trimmed with purple\r\n  velvet, and the waist has a collar of cream lace. So you may\r\n  imagine that we look quite like peacocks, only we\'ve no\r\n  trains....\r\n\r\n  A week ago yesterday there was [a] great football game between\r\n  Harvard and Yale, and there was tremendous excitement here. We\r\n  could hear the yells of the boys and the cheers of the lookers-on\r\n  as plainly in our room as if we had been on the field. Colonel\r\n  Roosevelt was there, on Harvard\'s side; but bless you, he wore a\r\n  white sweater, and no crimson that we know of! There were about\r\n  twenty-five thousand people at the game, and, when we went out,\r\n  the noise was so terrific, we nearly jumped out of our skins,\r\n  thinking it was the din of war, and not of a football game that\r\n  we heard. But, in spite of all their wild efforts, neither side\r\n  was scored, and we all laughed and said, "Oh, well now the pot\r\n  can\'t call the kettle black!"...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  559 Madison Avenue, New York,\r\n  January 2, 1900.\r\n  ...We have been here a week now, and are going to stay with Miss\r\n  Rhoades until Saturday. We are enjoying every moment of our\r\n  visit, every one is so good to us. We have seen many of our old\r\n  friends, and made some new ones. We dined with the Rogers last\r\n  Friday, and oh, they were so kind to us! The thought of their\r\n  gentle courtesy and genuine kindness brings a warm glow of joy\r\n  and gratitude to my heart. I have seen Dr. Greer too. He has such\r\n  a kind heart! I love him more than ever. We went to St.\r\n  Bartholomew\'s Sunday, and I have not felt so much at home in a\r\n  church since dear Bishop Brooks died. Dr. Greer read so slowly,\r\n  that my teacher could tell me every word. His people must have\r\n  wondered at his unusual deliberation. After the service he asked\r\n  Mr. Warren, the organist to play for me. I stood in the middle of\r\n  the church, where the vibrations from the great organ were\r\n  strongest, and I felt the mighty waves of sound beat against me,\r\n  as the great billows beat against a little ship at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN HITZ\r\n  138 Brattle Street, Cambridge,\r\n  Feb. 3, 1900.\r\n  ...My studies are more interesting than ever. In Latin, I am\r\n  reading Horace\'s odes. Although I find them difficult to\r\n  translate, yet I think they are the loveliest pieces of Latin\r\n  poetry I have read or shall ever read. In French we have finished\r\n  "Colomba," and I am reading "Horace" by Corneille and La\r\n  Fontaine\'s fables, both of which are in braille. I have not gone\r\n  far in either; but I know I shall enjoy the fables, they are so\r\n  delightfully written, and give such good lessons in a simple and\r\n  yet attractive way. I do not think I have told you that my dear\r\n  teacher is reading "The Faery Queen" to me. I am afraid I find\r\n  fault with the poem as much as I enjoy it. I do not care much for\r\n  the allegories, indeed I often find them tiresome, and I cannot\r\n  help thinking that Spenser\'s world of knights, paynims, fairies,\r\n  dragons and all sorts of strange creatures is a somewhat\r\n  grotesque and amusing world; but the poem itself is lovely and as\r\n  musical as a running brook.\r\n\r\n  I am now the proud owner of about fifteen new books, which we\r\n  ordered from Louisville. Among them are "Henry Esmond," "Bacon\'s\r\n  Essays" and extracts from "English Literature." Perhaps next week\r\n  I shall have some more books, "The Tempest," "A Midsummer Night\'s\r\n  Dream" and possibly some selections from Green\'s history of\r\n  England. Am I not very fortunate?\r\n\r\n  I am afraid this letter savors too much of books--but really they\r\n  make up my whole life these days, and I scarcely see or hear of\r\n  anything else! I do believe I sleep on books every night! You\r\n  know a student\'s life is of necessity somewhat circumscribed and\r\n  narrow and crowds out almost everything that is not in books....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ACADEMIC BOARD OF RADCLIFFE COLLEGE\r\n  138 Brattle Street, Cambridge, Mass.,\r\n  May 5, 1900.\r\n  Dear Sir:\r\n  As an aid to me in determining my plans for study the coming\r\n  year, I apply to you for information as to the possibility of my\r\n  taking the regular courses in Radcliffe College.\r\n\r\n  Since receiving my certificate of admission to Radcliffe last\r\n  July, I have been studying with a private tutor, Horace,\r\n  Aeschylus, French, German, Rhetoric, English History, English\r\n  Literature and Criticism, and English composition.\r\n\r\n  In college I should wish to continue most, if not all of these\r\n  subjects. The conditions under which I work require the presence\r\n  of Miss Sullivan, who has been my teacher and companion for\r\n  thirteen years, as an interpreter of oral speech and as a reader\r\n  of examination papers. In college she, or possibly in some\r\n  subjects some one else, would of necessity be with me in the\r\n  lecture-room and at recitations. I should do all my written work\r\n  on a typewriter, and if a Professor could not understand my\r\n  speech, I could write out my answers to his questions and hand\r\n  them to him after the recitation.\r\n\r\n  Is it possible for the College to accommodate itself to these\r\n  unprecedented conditions, so as to enable me to pursue my studies\r\n  at Radcliffe? I realize that the obstacles in the way of my\r\n  receiving a college education are very great--to others they may\r\n  seem insurmountable; but, dear Sir, a true soldier does not\r\n  acknowledge defeat before the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  38 Brattle Street, Cambridge,\r\n  June 9, 1900.\r\n  ...I have not yet heard from the Academic Board in reply to my\r\n  letter; but I sincerely hope they will answer favorably. My\r\n  friends think it very strange that they should hesitate so long,\r\n  especially when I have not asked them to simplify my work in the\r\n  least, but only to modify it so as to meet the existing\r\n  circumstances. Cornell has offered to make arrangements suited to\r\n  the conditions under which I work, if I should decide to go to\r\n  that college, and the University of Chicago has made a similar\r\n  offer, but I am afraid if I went to any other college, it would\r\n  be thought that I did not pass my examinations for Radcliffe\r\n  satisfactorily....\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the fall Miss Keller entered Radcliffe College.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN HITZ\r\n  14 Coolidge Ave., Cambridge,\r\n  Nov. 26, 1900.\r\n  ...--has already communicated with you in regard to her and my\r\n  plan of establishing an institution for deaf and blind children.\r\n  At first I was most enthusiastic in its support, and I never\r\n  dreamed that any grave objections could be raised except indeed\r\n  by those who are hostile to Teacher, but now, after thinking most\r\n  SERIOUSLY and consulting my friends, I have decided that--\'s\r\n  plan is by no means feasible. In my eagerness to make it possible\r\n  for deaf and blind children to have the same advantages that I\r\n  have had, I quite forgot that there might be many obstacles in\r\n  the way of my accomplishing anything like what--proposed.\r\n\r\n  My friends thought we might have one or two pupils in our own\r\n  home, thereby securing to me the advantage of being helpful to\r\n  others without any of the disadvantages of a large school. They\r\n  were very kind; but I could not help feeling that they spoke more\r\n  from a business than a humanitarian point of view. I am sure they\r\n  did not quite understand how passionately I desire that all who\r\n  are afflicted like myself shall receive their rightful\r\n  inheritance of thought, knowledge and love. Still I could not\r\n  shut my eyes to the force and weight of their arguments, and I\r\n  saw plainly that I must abandon--\'s scheme as impracticable.\r\n  They also said that I ought to appoint an advisory committee to\r\n  control my affairs while I am at Radcliffe. I considered this\r\n  suggestion carefully, then I told Mr. Rhoades that I should be\r\n  proud and glad to have wise friends to whom I could always turn\r\n  for advice in all important matters. For this committee I chose\r\n  six, my mother, Teacher, because she is like a mother to me, Mrs.\r\n  Hutton, Mr. Rhoades, Dr. Greer and Mr. Rogers, because it is they\r\n  who have supported me all these years and made it possible for me\r\n  to enter college. Mrs. Hutton had already written to mother,\r\n  asking her to telegraph if she was willing for me to have other\r\n  advisers besides herself and Teacher. This morning we received\r\n  word that mother had given her consent to this arrangement. Now\r\n  it remains for me to write to Dr. Greer and Mr. Rogers....\r\n\r\n  We had a long talk with Dr. Bell. Finally he proposed a plan\r\n  which delighted us all beyond words. He said that it was a\r\n  gigantic blunder to attempt to found a school for deaf and blind\r\n  children, because then they would lose the most precious\r\n  opportunities of entering into the fuller, richer, freer life of\r\n  seeing and hearing children. I had had misgivings on this point;\r\n  but I could not see how we were to help it. However Mr. Bell\r\n  suggested that--and all her friends who are interested in her\r\n  scheme should organize an association for the promotion of the\r\n  education of the deaf and blind, Teacher and myself being\r\n  included of course. Under his plan they were to appoint Teacher\r\n  to train others to instruct deaf and blind children in their own\r\n  homes, just as she had taught me. Funds were to be raised for the\r\n  teachers\' lodgings and also for their salaries. At the same time\r\n  Dr. Bell added that I could rest content and fight my way through\r\n  Radcliffe in competition with seeing and hearing girls, while the\r\n  great desire of my heart was being fulfilled. We clapped our\r\n  hands and shouted;--went away beaming with pleasure, and\r\n  Teacher and I felt more light of heart than we had for sometime.\r\n  Of course we can do nothing just now; but the painful anxiety\r\n  about my college work and the future welfare of the deaf and\r\n  blind has been lifted from our minds. Do tell me what you think\r\n  about Dr. Bell\'s suggestion. It seems most practical and wise to\r\n  me; but I must know all that there is to be known about it before\r\n  I speak or act in the matter....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. JOHN D. WRIGHT\r\n  Cambridge, December 9, 1900.\r\n  Do you think me a villain and--I can\'t think of a word bad enough\r\n  to express your opinion of me, unless indeed horse-thief will\r\n  answer the purpose. Tell me truly, do you think me as bad as\r\n  that? I hope not; for I have thought many letters to you which\r\n  never got on paper, and I am delighted to get your good letter,\r\n  yes, I really was, and I intended to answer it immediately, but\r\n  the days slip by unnoticed when one is busy, and I have been VERY\r\n  busy this fall. You must believe that. Radcliffe girls are always\r\n  up to their ears in work. If you doubt it, you\'d better come and\r\n  see for yourself.\r\n\r\n  Yes, I am taking the regular college course for a degree. When I\r\n  am a B.A., I suppose you will not dare call me a villain! I am\r\n  studying English--Sophomore English, if you please, (though I\r\n  can\'t see that it is different from just plain English) German,\r\n  French and History. I\'m enjoying my work even more than I\r\n  expected to, which is another way of saying that I\'m glad I came.\r\n  It is hard, very hard at times; but it hasn\'t swamped me yet. No,\r\n  I am not studying Mathematics, or Greek or Latin either. The\r\n  courses at Radcliffe are elective, only certain courses in\r\n  English are prescribed. I passed off my English and advanced\r\n  French before I entered college, and I choose the courses I like\r\n  best. I don\'t however intend to give up Latin and Greek entirely.\r\n  Perhaps I shall take up these studies later; but I\'ve said\r\n  goodbye to Mathematics forever, and I assure you, I was delighted\r\n  to see the last of those horrid goblins! I hope to obtain my\r\n  degree in four years; but I\'m not very particular about that.\r\n  There\'s no great hurry, and I want to get as much as possible out\r\n  of my studies. Many of my friends would be well pleased if I\r\n  would take two or even one course a year, but I rather object to\r\n  spending the rest of my life in college....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. WILLIAM WADE\r\n  14 Coolidge Avenue, Cambridge,\r\n  December 9, 1900.\r\n  ...Since you are so much interested in the deaf and blind, I will\r\n  begin by telling you of several cases I have come across lately.\r\n  Last October I heard of an unusually bright little girl in Texas.\r\n  Her name is Ruby Rice, and she is thirteen years old, I think.\r\n  She has never been taught; but they say she can sew and likes to\r\n  help others in this sort of work. Her sense of smell is\r\n  wonderful. Why, when she enters a store, she will go straight to\r\n  the showcases, and she can also distinguish her own things. Her\r\n  parents are very anxious indeed to find a teacher for her. They\r\n  have also written to Mr. Hitz about her.\r\n\r\n  I also know a child at the Institution for the Deaf in\r\n  Mississippi. Her name is Maud Scott, and she is six years old.\r\n  Miss Watkins, the lady who has charge of her wrote me a most\r\n  interesting letter. She said that Maud was born deaf and lost her\r\n  sight when she was only three months old, and that when she went\r\n  to the Institution a few weeks ago, she was quite helpless. She\r\n  could not even walk and had very little use of her hands. When\r\n  they tried to teach her to string beads, her little hands fell to\r\n  her side. Evidently her sense of touch has not been developed,\r\n  and as yet she can walk only when she holds some one\'s hand; but\r\n  she seems to be an exceedingly bright child. Miss Watkins adds\r\n  that she is very pretty. I have written to her that when Maud\r\n  learns to read, I shall have many stories to send her. The dear,\r\n  sweet little girl, it makes my heart ache to think how utterly\r\n  she is cut off from all that is good and desirable in life. But\r\n  Miss Watkins seems to be just the kind of teacher she needs.\r\n\r\n  I was in New York not long ago and I saw Miss Rhoades, who told\r\n  me that she had seen Katie McGirr. She said the poor young girl\r\n  talked and acted exactly like a little child. Katie played with\r\n  Miss Rhoades\'s rings and took them away, saying with a merry\r\n  laugh, "You shall not have them again!" She could only understand\r\n  Miss Rhoades when she talked about the simplest things. The\r\n  latter wished to send her some books; but she could not find\r\n  anything simple enough for her! She said Katie was very sweet\r\n  indeed, but sadly in need of proper instruction. I was much\r\n  surprised to hear all this; for I judged from your letters that\r\n  Katie was a very precocious girl....\r\n\r\n  A few days ago I met Tommy Stringer in the railroad station at\r\n  Wrentham. He is a great, strong boy now, and he will soon need a\r\n  man to take care of him; he is really too big for a lady to\r\n  manage. He goes to the public school, I hear, and his progress is\r\n  astonishing, they say; but it doesn\'t show as yet in his\r\n  conversation, which is limited to "Yes" and "No."...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MR. CHARLES T. COPELAND\r\n  December 20, 1900.\r\n  My dear Mr. Copeland;\r\n  I venture to write to you because I am afraid that if I do not\r\n  explain why I have stopped writing themes, you will think I have\r\n  become discouraged, or perhaps that to escape criticism I have\r\n  beat a cowardly retreat from your class. Please do not think\r\n  either of these very unpleasant thoughts. I am not discouraged,\r\n  nor am I afraid. I am confident that I could go on writing themes\r\n  like those I have written, and I suppose I should get through the\r\n  course with fairly good marks; but this sort of literary\r\n  patch-work has lost all interest for me. I have never been\r\n  satisfied with my work; but I never knew what my difficulty was\r\n  until you pointed it out to me. When I came to your class last\r\n  October, I was trying with all my might to be like everybody\r\n  else, to forget as entirely as possible my limitations and\r\n  peculiar environment. Now, however, I see the folly of attempting\r\n  to hitch one\'s wagon to a star with harness that does not belong\r\n  to it.\r\n\r\n  I have always accepted other peoples experiences and observations\r\n  as a matter of course. It never occurred to me that it might be\r\n  worth while to make my own observations and describe the\r\n  experiences peculiarly my own. Henceforth I am resolved to be\r\n  myself, to live my own life and write my own thoughts when I have\r\n  any. When I have written something that seems to be fresh and\r\n  spontaneous and worthy of your criticisms, I will bring it to\r\n  you, if I may, and if you think it good, I shall be happy; but if\r\n  your verdict is unfavorable, I shall try again and yet again\r\n  until I have succeeded in pleasing you...\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO  MRS. LAURENCE HUTTON\r\n  14 Coolidge Avenue, Cambridge,\r\n  December 27, 1900.\r\n  ...So you read about our class luncheon in the papers? How in the\r\n  world do the papers find out everything, I wonder. I am sure no\r\n  reporter was present. I had a splendid time; the toasts and\r\n  speeches were great fun. I only spoke a few words, as I did not\r\n  know I was expected to speak until a few minutes before I was\r\n  called upon. I think I wrote you that I had been elected\r\n  Vice-President of the Freshman Class of Radcliffe.\r\n\r\n  Did I tell you in my last letter that I had a new dress, a real\r\n  party dress with low neck and short sleeves and quite a train? It\r\n  is pale blue, trimmed with chiffon of the same color. I have worn\r\n  it only once, but then I felt that Solomon in all his glory was\r\n  not to be compared with me! Anyway, he certainly never had a\r\n  dress like mine!...\r\n\r\n  A gentleman in Philadelphia has just written to my teacher about\r\n  a deaf and blind child in Paris, whose parents are Poles. The\r\n  mother is a physician and a brilliant woman, he says. This little\r\n  boy could speak two or three languages before he lost his hearing\r\n  through sickness, and he is now only about five years old. Poor\r\n  little fellow, I wish I could do something for him; but he is so\r\n  young, my teacher thinks it would be too bad to separate him from\r\n  his mother. I have had a letter from Mrs. Thaw with regard to the\r\n  possibility of doing something for these children. Dr. Bell\r\n  thinks the present census will show that there are more than a\r\n  thousand in the United States alone [The number of deaf-blind\r\n  young enough to be benefited by education is not so large as\r\n  this; but the education of this class of defectives has been\r\n  neglected.]; and Mrs. Thaw thinks if all my friends were to unite\r\n  their efforts, "it would be an easy matter to establish at the\r\n  beginning of this new century a new line upon which mercy might\r\n  travel," and the rescue of these unfortunate children could be\r\n  accomplished....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MR. WILLIAM WADE\r\n  Cambridge, February 2, 1901.\r\n  ...By the way, have you any specimens of English braille\r\n  especially printed for those who have lost their sight late in\r\n  life or have fingers hardened by long toil, so that their touch\r\n  is less sensitive than that of other blind people? I read an\r\n  account of such a system in one of my English magazines, and I am\r\n  anxious to know more about it. If it is as efficient as they say,\r\n  I see no reason why English braille should not be adopted by the\r\n  blind of all countries. Why, it is the print that can be most\r\n  readily adapted to many different languages. Even Greek can be\r\n  embossed in it, as you know. Then, too, it will be rendered still\r\n  more efficient by the "interpointing system," which will save an\r\n  immense amount of space and paper. There is nothing more absurd,\r\n  I think, than to have five or six different prints for the\r\n  blind....\r\n\r\n\r\n  This letter was written in response to a tentative offer from the\r\n  editor of The Great Round World to have the magazine published in\r\n  raised type for the blind, if enough were willing to subscribe.\r\n  It is evident that the blind should have a good magazine, not a\r\n  special magazine for the blind, but one of our best monthlies,\r\n  printed in embossed letters. The blind alone could not support\r\n  it, but it would not take very much money to make up the\r\n  additional expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To THE GREAT ROUND WORLD\r\n  Cambridge, Feb. 16, 1901.\r\n  The Great Round World,\r\n  New York City.\r\n  Gentlemen: I have only to-day found time to reply to your\r\n  interesting letter. A little bird had already sung the good news\r\n  in my ear; but it was doubly pleasant to have it straight from\r\n  you.\r\n\r\n  It would be splendid to have The Great Round World printed in\r\n  "language that can be felt." I doubt if any one who enjoys the\r\n  wondrous privilege of seeing can have any conception of the boon\r\n  such a publication as you contemplate would be to the sightless.\r\n  To be able to read for one\'s self what is being willed, thought\r\n  and done in the world--the world in whose joys and sorrows,\r\n  failures and successes one feels the keenest interest--that would\r\n  indeed be a happiness too deep for words. I trust that the effort\r\n  of The Great Round World to bring light to those who sit in\r\n  darkness will receive the encouragement and support it so richly\r\n  deserves.\r\n\r\n  I doubt, however, if the number of subscribers to an embossed\r\n  edition of The Great Round World would ever be large; for I am\r\n  told that the blind as a class are poor. But why should not the\r\n  friends of the blind assist The Great Round World, if necessary?\r\n  Surely there are hearts and hands ever ready to make it possible\r\n  for generous intentions to be wrought into noble deeds.\r\n\r\n  Wishing you godspeed in an undertaking that is very dear to my\r\n  heart, I am, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO MISS NINA RHOADES\r\n  Cambridge, Sept. 25, 1901.\r\n  ...We remained in Halifax until about the middle of August....\r\n  Day after day the Harbor, the warships, and the park kept us busy\r\n  thinking and feeling and enjoying.... When the Indiana visited\r\n  Halifax, we were invited to go on board, and she sent her own\r\n  launch for us. I touched the immense cannon, read with my fingers\r\n  several of the names of the Spanish ships that were captured at\r\n  Santiago, and felt the places where she had been pierced with\r\n  shells. The Indiana was the largest and finest ship in the\r\n  Harbor, and we felt very proud of her.\r\n\r\n  After we left Halifax, we visited Dr. Bell at Cape Breton. He has\r\n  a charming, romantic house on a mountain called Beinn Bhreagh,\r\n  which overlooks the Bras d\'Or Lake....\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bell told me many interesting things about his work. He had\r\n  just constructed a boat that could be propelled by a kite with\r\n  the wind in its favor, and one day he tried experiments to see if\r\n  he could steer the kite against the wind. I was there and really\r\n  helped him fly the kites. On one of them I noticed that the\r\n  strings were of wire, and having had some experience in bead\r\n  work, I said I thought they would break. Dr. Bell said "No!" with\r\n  great confidence, and the kite was sent up. It began to pull and\r\n  tug, and lo, the wires broke, and off went the great red dragon,\r\n  and poor Dr. Bell stood looking forlornly after it. After that he\r\n  asked me if the strings were all right and changed them at once\r\n  when I answered in the negative. Altogether we had great fun....\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO DR. EDWARD EVERETT HALE [Read by Dr. Hale at the celebration\r\n  of the centenary of Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, at Tremont Temple,\r\n  Boston, Nov. 11, 1901.]\r\n  Cambridge, Nov. 10, 1901.\r\n  My teacher and I expect to be present at the meeting tomorrow in\r\n  commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of Dr. Howe\'s\r\n  birth; but I very much doubt if we shall have an opportunity to\r\n  speak with you; so I am writing now to tell you how delighted I\r\n  am that you are to speak at the meeting, because I feel that you,\r\n  better than any one I know will express the heartfelt gratitude\r\n  of those who owe their education, their opportunities, their\r\n  happiness to him who opened the eyes of the blind and gave the\r\n  dumb lip language.\r\n\r\n  Sitting here in my study, surrounded by my books, enjoying the\r\n  sweet and intimate companionship of the great and the wise, I am\r\n  trying to realize what my life might have been, if Dr. Howe had\r\n  failed in the great task God gave him to perform. If he had not\r\n  taken upon himself the responsibility of Laura Bridgman\'s\r\n  education and led her out of the pit of Acheron back to her human\r\n  inheritance, should I be a sophomore at Radcliffe College\r\n  to-day--who can say? But it is idle to speculate about what might\r\n  have been in connection with Dr. Howe\'s great achievement.\r\n\r\n  I think only those who have escaped that death-in-life existence,\r\n  from which Laura Bridgman was rescued, can realize how isolated,\r\n  how shrouded in darkness, how cramped by its own impotence is a\r\n  soul without thought or faith or hope. Words are powerless to\r\n  describe the desolation of that prison-house, or the joy of the\r\n  soul that is delivered out of its captivity. When we compare the\r\n  needs and helplessness of the blind before Dr. Howe began his\r\n  work, with their present usefulness and independence, we realize\r\n  that great things have been done in our midst. What if physical\r\n  conditions have built up high walls about us? Thanks to our\r\n  friend and helper, our world lies upward; the length and breadth\r\n  and sweep of the heavens are ours!\r\n\r\n  It is pleasant to think that Dr. Howe\'s noble deeds will receive\r\n  their due tribute of affection and gratitude, in the city, which\r\n  was the scene of his great labors and splendid victories for\r\n  humanity.\r\n\r\n  With kind greetings, in which my teacher joins me, I am\r\n  Affectionately your friend,\r\n  HELEN KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE HON. GEORGE FRISBIE HOAR\r\n  Cambridge, Mass., November 25, 1901.\r\n  My Dear Senator Hoar:--\r\n  I am glad you liked my letter about Dr. Howe. It was written out\r\n  of my heart, and perhaps that is why it met a sympathetic\r\n  response in other hearts. I will ask Dr. Hale to lend me the\r\n  letter, so that I can make a copy of it for you.\r\n\r\n  You see, I use a typewriter--it is my right hand man, so to\r\n  speak. Without it I do not see how I could go to college. I write\r\n  all my themes and examinations on it, even Greek. Indeed, it has\r\n  only one drawback, and that probably is regarded as an advantage\r\n  by the professors; it is that one\'s mistakes may be detected at a\r\n  glance; for there is no chance to hide them in illegible writing.\r\n\r\n  I know you will be amused when I tell you that I am deeply\r\n  interested in politics. I like to have the papers read to me, and\r\n  I try to understand the great questions of the day; but I am\r\n  afraid my knowledge is very unstable; for I change my opinions\r\n  with every new book I read. I used to think that when I studied\r\n  Civil Government and Economics, all my difficulties and\r\n  perplexities would blossom into beautiful certainties; but alas,\r\n  I find that there are more tares than wheat in these fertile\r\n  fields of knowledge....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII: A SUPPLEMENTARY ACCOUNT OF HELEN KELLER\'S LIFE AND EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. The Writing of the Book\r\n\r\nIt is fitting that Miss Keller\'s "Story of My Life" should appear at\r\nthis time. What is remarkable in her career is already accomplished,\r\nand whatever she may do in the future will be but a relatively slight\r\naddition to the success which distinguishes her now. That success has\r\njust been assured, for it is her work at Radcliffe during the last two\r\nyears which has shown that she can carry her education as far as if\r\nshe were studying under normal conditions. Whatever doubts Miss Keller\r\nherself may have had are now at rest.\r\n\r\nSeveral passages of her autobiography, as it appeared in serial form,\r\nhave been made the subject of a grave editorial in a Boston newspaper,\r\nin which the writer regretted Miss Keller\'s apparent disillusionment in\r\nregard to the value of her college life. He quoted the passages in which\r\nshe explains that college is not the "universal Athens" she had hoped to\r\nfind, and cited the cases of other remarkable persons whose college life\r\nhad proved disappointing. But it is to be remembered that Miss Keller\r\nhas written many things in her autobiography for the fun of writing\r\nthem, and the disillusion, which the writer of the editorial took\r\nseriously, is in great part humorous. Miss Keller does not suppose her\r\nviews to be of great importance, and when she utters her opinions on\r\nimportant matters she takes it for granted that her reader will receive\r\nthem as the opinions of a junior in college, not of one who writes with\r\nthe wisdom of maturity. For instance, it surprised her that some people\r\nwere annoyed at what she said about the Bible, and she was amused that\r\nthey did not see, what was plain enough, that she had been obliged\r\nto read the whole Bible in a course in English literature, not as a\r\nreligious duty put upon her by her teacher or her parents.\r\n\r\nI ought to apologize to the reader and to Miss Keller for presuming\r\nto say what her subject matter is worth, but one more explanation is\r\nnecessary. In her account of her early education Miss Keller is not\r\ngiving a scientifically accurate record of her life, nor even of the\r\nimportant events. She cannot know in detail how she was taught, and her\r\nmemory of her childhood is in some cases an idealized memory of what\r\nshe has learned later from her teacher and others. She is less able to\r\nrecall events of fifteen years ago than most of us are to recollect our\r\nchildhood. That is why her teacher\'s records may be found to differ in\r\nsome particulars from Miss Keller\'s account.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Miss Keller wrote her story shows, as nothing else can\r\nshow, the difficulties she had to overcome. When we write, we can go\r\nback over our work, shuffle the pages, interline, rearrange, see how\r\nthe paragraphs look in proof, and so construct the whole work before\r\nthe eye, as an architect constructs his plans. When Miss Keller puts her\r\nwork in typewritten form, she cannot refer to it again unless some one\r\nreads it to her by means of the manual alphabet.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty is in part obviated by the use of her braille machine,\r\nwhich makes a manuscript that she can read; but as her work must be put\r\nultimately in typewritten form, and as a braille machine is somewhat\r\ncumbersome, she has got into the habit of writing directly on her\r\ntypewriter. She depends so little on her braille manuscript, that, when\r\nshe began to write her story more than a year ago and had put in\r\nbraille a hundred pages of material and notes, she made the mistake of\r\ndestroying these notes before she had finished her manuscript. Thus she\r\ncomposed much of her story on the typewriter, and in constructing it\r\nas a whole depended on her memory to guide her in putting together the\r\ndetached episodes, which Miss Sullivan read over to her.\r\n\r\nLast July, when she had finished under great pressure of work her final\r\nchapter, she set to work to rewrite the whole story. Her good friend,\r\nMr. William Wade, had a complete braille copy made for her from the\r\nmagazine proofs. Then for the first time she had her whole manuscript\r\nunder her finger at once. She saw imperfections in the arrangement of\r\nparagraphs and the repetition of phrases. She saw, too, that her story\r\nproperly fell into short chapters and redivided it.\r\n\r\nPartly from temperament, partly from the conditions of her work, she has\r\nwritten rather a series of brilliant passages than a unified narrative;\r\nin point of fact, several paragraphs of her story are short themes\r\nwritten in her English courses, and the small unit sometimes shows its\r\noriginal limits.\r\n\r\nIn rewriting the story, Miss Keller made corrections on separate\r\npages on her braille machine. Long corrections she wrote out on her\r\ntypewriter, with catch-words to indicate where they belonged. Then she\r\nread from her braille copy the entire story, making corrections as she\r\nread, which were taken down on the manuscript that went to the printer.\r\nDuring this revision she discussed questions of subject matter and\r\nphrasing. She sat running her finger over the braille manuscript,\r\nstopping now and then to refer to the braille notes on which she had\r\nindicated her corrections, all the time reading aloud to verify the\r\nmanuscript.\r\n\r\nShe listened to criticism just as any author listens to his friends or\r\nhis editor. Miss Sullivan, who is an excellent critic, made suggestions\r\nat many points in the course of composition and revision. One newspaper\r\nsuggested that Miss Keller had been led into writing the book and had\r\nbeen influenced to put certain things into it by zealous friends. As a\r\nmatter of fact, most of the advice she has received and heeded has led\r\nto excisions rather than to additions. The book is Miss Keller\'s and is\r\nfinal proof of her independent power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. PERSONALITY\r\n\r\nMark Twain has said that the two most interesting characters of the\r\nnineteenth century are Napoleon and Helen Keller. The admiration with\r\nwhich the world has regarded her is more than justified by what she has\r\ndone. No one can tell any great truth about her which has not already\r\nbeen written, and all that I can do is to give a few more facts about\r\nMiss Keller\'s work and add a little to what is known of her personality.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller is tall and strongly built, and has always had good health.\r\nShe seems to be more nervous than she really is, because she expresses\r\nmore with her hands than do most English-speaking people. One reason\r\nfor this habit of gesture is that her hands have been so long her\r\ninstruments of communication that they have taken to themselves the\r\nquick shiftings of the eye, and express some of the things that we say\r\nin a glance. All deaf people naturally gesticulate. Indeed, at one time\r\nit was believed that the best way for them to communicate was through\r\nsystematized gestures, the sign language invented by the Abbe de l\'Epee.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Keller speaks, her face is animated and expresses all the\r\nmodes of her thought--the expressions that make the features eloquent\r\nand give speech half its meaning. On the other hand she does not know\r\nanother\'s expression. When she is talking with an intimate friend,\r\nhowever, her hand goes quickly to her friend\'s face to see, as she says,\r\n"the twist of the mouth." In this way she is able to get the meaning of\r\nthose half sentences which we complete unconsciously from the tone of\r\nthe voice or the twinkle of the eye.\r\n\r\nHer memory of people is remarkable. She remembers the grasp of fingers\r\nshe has held before, all the characteristic tightening of the muscles\r\nthat makes one person\'s handshake different from that of another.\r\n\r\nThe trait most characteristic, perhaps, of Miss Keller (and also of Miss\r\nSullivan) is humour. Skill in the use of words and her habit of playing\r\nwith them make her ready with mots and epigrams.\r\n\r\nSome one asked her if she liked to study.\r\n\r\n"Yes," she replied, "but I like to play also, and I feel sometimes as if\r\nI were a music box with all the play shut up inside me."\r\n\r\nWhen she met Dr. Furness, the Shakespearean scholar, he warned her not\r\nto let the college professors tell her too many assumed facts about\r\nthe life of Shakespeare; all we know, he said, is that Shakespeare was\r\nbaptized, married, and died.\r\n\r\n"Well," she replied, "he seems to have done all the essential things."\r\n\r\nOnce a friend who was learning the manual alphabet kept making "g,"\r\nwhich is like the hand of a sign-post, for "h," which is made with two\r\nfingers extended. Finally Miss Keller told him to "fire both barrels."\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Jefferson was once explaining to Miss Keller what the bumps\r\non her head meant.\r\n\r\n"That," he said, "is your prize-fighting bump."\r\n\r\n"I never fight," she replied, "except against difficulties."\r\n\r\nMiss Keller\'s humour is that deeper kind of humour which is courage.\r\n\r\nThirteen years ago she made up her mind to learn to speak, and she gave\r\nher teacher no rest until she was allowed to take lessons, although wise\r\npeople, even Miss Sullivan, the wisest of them all, regarded it as an\r\nexperiment unlikely to succeed and almost sure to make her unhappy. It\r\nwas this same perseverance that made her go to college. After she had\r\npassed her examinations and received her certificate of admission,\r\nshe was advised by the Dean of Radcliffe and others not to go on. She\r\naccordingly delayed a year. But she was not satisfied until she had\r\ncarried out her purpose and entered college.\r\n\r\nHer life has been a series of attempts to do whatever other people do,\r\nand to do it as well. Her success has been complete, for in trying to\r\nbe like other people she has come most fully to be herself. Her\r\nunwillingness to be beaten has developed her courage. Where another\r\ncan go, she can go. Her respect for physical bravery is like\r\nStevenson\'s--the boy\'s contempt for the fellow who cries, with a touch\r\nof young bravado in it. She takes tramps in the woods, plunging through\r\nthe underbrush, where she is scratched and bruised; yet you could not\r\nget her to admit that she is hurt, and you certainly could not persuade\r\nher to stay at home next time.\r\n\r\nSo when people try experiments with her, she displays a sportsmanlike\r\ndetermination to win in any test, however unreasonable, that one may\r\nwish to put her to.\r\n\r\nIf she does not know the answer to a question, she guesses with\r\nmischievous assurance. Ask her the colour of your coat (no blind person\r\ncan tell colour), she will feel it and say "black." If it happens to be\r\nblue, and you tell her so triumphantly, she is likely to answer, "Thank\r\nyou. I am glad you know. Why did you ask me?"\r\n\r\nHer whimsical and adventuresome spirit puts her so much on her mettle\r\nthat she makes rather a poor subject for the psychological experimenter.\r\nMoreover, Miss Sullivan does not see why Miss Keller should be subjected\r\nto the investigation of the scientist, and has not herself made many\r\nexperiments. When a psychologist asked her if Miss Keller spelled on her\r\nfingers in her sleep, Miss Sullivan replied that she did not think\r\nit worth while to sit up and watch, such matters were of so little\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller likes to be part of the company. If any one whom she is\r\ntouching laughs at a joke, she laughs, too, just as if she had heard\r\nit. If others are aglow with music, a responding glow, caught\r\nsympathetically, shines in her face. Indeed, she feels the movements\r\nof Miss Sullivan so minutely that she responds to her moods, and so she\r\nseems to know what is going on, even though the conversation has not\r\nbeen spelled to her for some time. In the same way her response to music\r\nis in part sympathetic, although she enjoys it for its own sake.\r\n\r\nMusic probably can mean little to her but beat and pulsation. She cannot\r\nsing and she cannot play the piano, although, as some early experiments\r\nshow, she could learn mechanically to beat out a tune on the keys. Her\r\nenjoyment of music, however, is very genuine, for she has a tactile\r\nrecognition of sound when the waves of air beat against her. Part of her\r\nexperience of the rhythm of music comes, no doubt, from the vibration\r\nof solid objects which she is touching: the floor, or, what is more\r\nevident, the case of the piano, on which her hand rests. But she seems\r\nto feel the pulsation of the air itself. When the organ was played for\r\nher in St. Bartholomew\'s, the whole building shook with the great\r\npedal notes, but that does not altogether account for what she felt and\r\nenjoyed. The vibration of the air as the organ notes swelled made her\r\nsway in answer. Sometimes she puts her hand on a singer\'s throat to\r\nfeel the muscular thrill and contraction, and from this she gets genuine\r\npleasure. No one knows, however, just what her sensations are. It is\r\namusing to read in one of the magazines of 1895 that Miss Keller "has\r\na just and intelligent appreciation of different composers from having\r\nliterally felt their music, Schumann being her favourite." If she knows\r\nthe difference between Schumann and Beethoven, it is because she has\r\nread it, and if she has read it, she remembers it and can tell any one\r\nwho asks her.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller\'s effort to reach out and meet other people on their own\r\nintellectual ground has kept her informed of daily affairs. When her\r\neducation became more systematic and she was busy with books, it would\r\nhave been very easy for Miss Sullivan to let her draw into herself, if\r\nshe had been so inclined. But every one who has met her has given\r\nhis best ideas to her and she has taken them. If, in the course of a\r\nconversation, the friend next to her has ceased for some moments to\r\nspell into her hand, the question comes inevitably, "What are you\r\ntalking about?" Thus she picks up the fragments of the daily intercourse\r\nof normal people, so that her detailed information is singularly full\r\nand accurate. She is a good talker on the little occasional affairs of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMuch of her knowledge comes to her directly. When she is out walking she\r\noften stops suddenly, attracted by the odour of a bit of shrubbery. She\r\nreaches out and touches the leaves, and the world of growing things is\r\nhers, as truly as it is ours, to enjoy while she holds the leaves in her\r\nfingers and smells the blossoms, and to remember when the walk is done.\r\n\r\nWhen she is in a new place, especially an interesting place like\r\nNiagara, whoever accompanies her--usually, of course, Miss Sullivan--is\r\nkept busy giving her an idea of visible details. Miss Sullivan, who\r\nknows her pupil\'s mind, selects from the passing landscape essential\r\nelements, which give a certain clearness to Miss Keller\'s imagined\r\nview of an outer world that to our eyes is confused and overloaded with\r\nparticulars. If her companion does not give her enough details,\r\nMiss Keller asks questions until she has completed the view to her\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nShe does not see with her eyes, but through the inner faculty to serve\r\nwhich eyes were given to us. When she returns from a walk and tells some\r\none about it, her descriptions are accurate and vivid. A comparative\r\nexperience drawn from written descriptions and from her teacher\'s words\r\nhas kept her free from errors in her use of terms of sound and\r\nvision. True, her view of life is highly coloured and full of poetic\r\nexaggeration; the universe, as she sees it, is no doubt a little better\r\nthan it really is. But her knowledge of it is not so incomplete as one\r\nmight suppose. Occasionally she astonishes you by ignorance of some fact\r\nwhich no one happens to have told her; for instance, she did not know,\r\nuntil her first plunge into the sea, that it is salt. Many of the\r\ndetached incidents and facts of our daily life pass around and over her\r\nunobserved; but she has enough detailed acquaintance with the world to\r\nkeep her view of it from being essentially defective.\r\n\r\nMost that she knows at first hand comes from her sense of touch. This\r\nsense is not, however, so finely developed as in some other blind\r\npeople. Laura Bridgman could tell minute shades of difference in the\r\nsize of thread, and made beautiful lace. Miss Keller used to knit and\r\ncrochet, but she has had better things to do. With her varied powers and\r\naccomplishments, her sense of touch has not been used enough to develop\r\nit very far beyond normal acuteness. A friend tried Miss Keller one\r\nday with several coins. She was slower than he expected her to be in\r\nidentifying them by their relative weight and size. But it should be\r\nsaid she almost never handles money--one of the many sordid and petty\r\ndetails of life, by the way, which she has been spared.\r\n\r\nShe recognizes the subject and general intention of a statuette six\r\ninches high. Anything shallower than a half-inch bas-relief is a blank\r\nto her, so far as it expresses an idea of beauty. Large statues, of\r\nwhich she can feel the sweep of line with her whole hand, she knows in\r\ntheir higher esthetic value. She suggests herself that she can know\r\nthem better than we do, because she can get the true dimensions and\r\nappreciate more immediately the solid nature of a sculptured figure.\r\nWhen she was at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston she stood on a\r\nstep-ladder and let both hands play over the statues. When she felt a\r\nbas-relief of dancing girls she asked, "Where are the singers?" When\r\nshe found them she said, "One is silent." The lips of the singer were\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in her daily life that one can best measure the delicacy\r\nof her senses and her manual skill. She seems to have very little sense\r\nof direction. She gropes her way without much certainty in rooms where\r\nshe is quite familiar. Most blind people are aided by the sense of\r\nsound, so that a fair comparison is hard to make, except with other\r\ndeaf-blind persons. Her dexterity is not notable either in comparison\r\nwith the normal person, whose movements are guided by the eye, or, I am\r\ntold, with other blind people. She has practised no single constructive\r\ncraft which would call for the use of her hands. When she was twelve,\r\nher friend Mr. Albert H. Munsell, the artist, let her experiment with a\r\nwax tablet and a stylus. He says that she did pretty well and managed to\r\nmake, after models, some conventional designs of the outlines of leaves\r\nand rosettes. The only thing she does which requires skill with\r\nthe hands is her work on the typewriter. Although she has used the\r\ntypewriter since she was eleven years old, she is rather careful than\r\nrapid. She writes with fair speed and absolute sureness. Her manuscripts\r\nseldom contain typographical errors when she hands them to Miss Sullivan\r\nto read. Her typewriter has no special attachments. She keeps the\r\nrelative position of the keys by an occasional touch of the little\r\nfinger on the outer edge of the board.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller\'s reading of the manual alphabet by her sense of touch seems\r\nto cause some perplexity. Even people who know her fairly well have\r\nwritten in the magazines about Miss Sullivan\'s "mysterious telegraphic\r\ncommunications" with her pupil. The manual alphabet is that in use among\r\nall educated deaf people. Most dictionaries contain an engraving of the\r\nmanual letters. The deaf person with sight looks at the fingers of his\r\ncompanion, but it is also possible to feel them. Miss Keller puts her\r\nfingers lightly over the hand of one who is talking to her and gets the\r\nwords as rapidly as they can be spelled. As she explains, she is not\r\nconscious of the single letters or of separate words. Miss Sullivan and\r\nothers who live constantly with the deaf can spell very rapidly--fast\r\nenough to get a slow lecture, not fast enough to get every word of a\r\nrapid speaker.\r\n\r\nAnybody can learn the manual letters in a few minutes, use them slowly\r\nin a day, and in thirty days of constant use talk to Miss Keller or any\r\nother deaf person without realizing what his fingers are doing. If more\r\npeople knew this, and the friends and relatives of deaf children learned\r\nthe manual alphabet at once the deaf all over the world would be happier\r\nand better educated.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller reads by means of embossed print or the various kinds of\r\nbraille. The ordinary embossed book is made with roman letters, both\r\nsmall letters and capitals. These letters are of simple, square, angular\r\ndesign. The small letters are about three-sixteenths of an inch high,\r\nand are raised from the page the thickness of the thumbnail. The books\r\nare large, about the size of a volume of an encyclopedia. Green\'s "Short\r\nHistory of the English People" is in six large volumes. The books are\r\nnot heavy, because the leaves with the raised type do not lie close. The\r\ntime that one of Miss Keller\'s friends realizes most strongly that she\r\nis blind is when he comes on her suddenly in the dark and hears the\r\nrustle of her fingers across the page.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient print for the blind is braille, which has several\r\nvariations, too many, indeed--English, American, New York Point. Miss\r\nKeller reads them all. Most educated blind people know several, but it\r\nwould save trouble if, as Miss Keller suggests, English braille were\r\nuniversally adopted. The facsimile on page xv [omitted from etext] gives\r\nan idea of how the raised dots look. Each character (either a letter or\r\na special braille contraction) is a combination made by varying in place\r\nand number points in six possible positions. Miss Keller has a braille\r\nwriter on which she keeps notes and writes letters to her blind friends.\r\nThere are six keys, and by pressing different combinations at a stroke\r\n(as one plays a chord on the piano) the operator makes a character at a\r\ntime in a sheet of thick paper, and can write about half as rapidly\r\nas on a typewriter. Braille is especially useful in making single\r\nmanuscript copies of books.\r\n\r\nBooks for the blind are very limited in number. They cost a great deal\r\nto publish and they have not a large enough sale to make them profitable\r\nto the publisher; but there are several institutions with special funds\r\nto pay for embossed books. Miss Keller is more fortunate than most blind\r\npeople in the kindness of her friends who have books made especially for\r\nher, and in the willingness of gentlemen, like Mr. E. E. Allen of the\r\nPennsylvania Institute for the Instruction of the Blind, to print, as he\r\nhas on several occasions, editions of books that she has needed.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller does not as a rule read very fast, but she reads\r\ndeliberately, not so much because she feels the words less quickly than\r\nwe see then, as because it is one of her habits of mind to do things\r\nthoroughly and well. When a passage interests her, or she needs to\r\nremember it for some future use, she flutters it off swiftly on the\r\nfingers of her right hand. Sometimes this finger-play is unconscious.\r\nMiss Keller talks to herself absent-mindedly in the manual alphabet.\r\nWhen she is walking up or down the hall or along the veranda, her hands\r\ngo flying along beside her like a confusion of birds\' wings.\r\n\r\nThere is, I am told, tactile memory as well as visual and aural memory.\r\nMiss Sullivan says that both she and Miss Keller remember "in their\r\nfingers" what they have said. For Miss Keller to spell a sentence in the\r\nmanual alphabet impresses it on her mind just as we learn a thing from\r\nhaving heard it many times and can call back the memory of its sound.\r\n\r\nLike every deaf or blind person, Miss Keller depends on her sense of\r\nsmell to an unusual degree. When she was a little girl she smelled\r\neverything and knew where she was, what neighbour\'s house she was\r\npassing, by the distinctive odours. As her intellect grew she became\r\nless dependent on this sense. To what extent she now identifies objects\r\nby their odour is hard to determine. The sense of smell has fallen into\r\ndisrepute, and a deaf person is reluctant to speak of it. Miss Keller\'s\r\nacute sense of smell may account, however, in some part for that\r\nrecognition of persons and things which it has been customary to\r\nattribute to a special sense, or to an unusual development of the power\r\nthat we all seem to have of telling when some one is near.\r\n\r\nThe question of a special "sixth sense," such as people have ascribed.\r\nto Miss Keller, is a delicate one. This much is certain, she cannot have\r\nany sense that other people may not have, and the existence of a special\r\nsense is not evident to her or to any one who knows her. Miss Keller is\r\ndistinctly not a singular proof of occult and mysterious theories,\r\nand any attempt to explain her in that way fails to reckon with her\r\nnormality. She is no more mysterious and complex than any other person.\r\nAll that she is, all that she has done, can be explained directly,\r\nexcept such things in every human being as never can be explained. She\r\ndoes not, it would seem, prove the existence of spirit without matter,\r\nor of innate ideas, or of immortality, or anything else that any other\r\nhuman being does not prove. Philosophers have tried to find out what was\r\nher conception of abstract ideas before she learned language. If she had\r\nany conception, there is no way of discovering it now; for she cannot\r\nremember, and obviously there was no record at the time. She had no\r\nconception of God before she heard the word "God," as her comments very\r\nclearly show.\r\n\r\nHer sense of time is excellent, but whether it would have developed as\r\na special faculty cannot be known, for she has had a watch since she was\r\nseven years old.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller has two watches, which have been given her. They are, I\r\nthink, the only ones of their kind in America. The watch has on the back\r\ncover a flat gold indicator which can be pushed freely around from left\r\nto right until, by means of a pin inside the case, it locks with the\r\nhour hand and takes a corresponding position. The point of this gold\r\nindicator bends over the edge of the case, round which are set eleven\r\nraised points--the stem forms the twelfth. Thus the watch, an ordinary\r\nwatch with a white dial for the person who sees, becomes for a blind\r\nperson by this special attachment in effect one with a single raised\r\nhour hand and raised figures. Though there is less than half an inch\r\nbetween the points--a space which represents sixty minutes--Miss Keller\r\ntells the time almost exactly. It should be said that any double-case\r\nwatch with the crystal removed serves well enough for a blind person\r\nwhose touch is sufficiently delicate to feel the position of the hands\r\nand not disturb or injure them.\r\n\r\nThe finer traits of Miss Keller\'s character are so well known that one\r\nneeds not say much about them. Good sense, good humour, and imagination\r\nkeep her scheme of things sane and beautiful. No attempt is made by\r\nthose around her either to preserve or to break her illusions. When she\r\nwas a little girl, a good many unwise and tactless things that were\r\nsaid for her benefit were not repeated to her, thanks to the wise\r\nwatchfulness of Miss Sullivan. Now that she has grown up, nobody thinks\r\nof being less frank with her than with any other intelligent young\r\nwoman. What her good friend, Charles Dudley Warner, wrote about her in\r\nHarper\'s Magazine in 1896 was true then, and it remains true now:\r\n\r\n"I believe she is the purest-minded human ever in existence.... The\r\nworld to her is what her own mind is. She has not even learned\r\nthat exhibition on which so many pride themselves, of \'righteous\r\nindignation.\'\r\n\r\n"Some time ago, when a policeman shot dead her dog, a dearly loved daily\r\ncompanion, she found in her forgiving heart no condemnation for the\r\nman; she only said, \'If he had only known what a good dog she was, he\r\nwouldn\'t have shot her.\' It was said of old time, \'Lord forgive them,\r\nthey know not what they do!\'\r\n\r\n"Of course the question will arise whether, if Helen Keller had not\r\nbeen guarded from the knowledge of evil, she would have been what she\r\nis to-day.... Her mind has neither been made effeminate by the weak and\r\nsilly literature, nor has it been vitiated by that which is suggestive\r\nof baseness. In consequence her mind is not only vigorous, but it is\r\npure. She is in love with noble things, with noble thoughts, and with\r\nthe characters of noble men and women."\r\n\r\nShe still has a childlike aversion to tragedies. Her imagination is so\r\nvital that she falls completely under the illusion of a story, and lives\r\nin its world. Miss Sullivan writes in a letter of 1891:\r\n\r\n"Yesterday I read to her the story of \'Macbeth,\' as told by Charles\r\nand Mary Lamb. She was very greatly excited by it, and said: \'It is\r\nterrible! It makes me tremble!\' After thinking a little while, she\r\nadded, \'I think Shakespeare made it very terrible so that people would\r\nsee how fearful it is to do wrong.\'"\r\n\r\nOf the real world she knows more of the good and less of the evil than\r\nmost people seem to know. Her teacher does not harass her with the\r\nlittle unhappy things; but of the important difficulties they have\r\nbeen through, Miss Keller was fully informed, took her share of\r\nthe suffering, and put her mind to the problems. She is logical and\r\ntolerant, most trustful of a world that has treated her kindly.\r\n\r\nOnce when some one asked her to define "love," she replied, "Why, bless\r\nyou, that is easy; it is what everybody feels for everybody else."\r\n\r\n"Toleration," she said once, when she was visiting her friend Mrs.\r\nLaurence Hutton, "is the greatest gift of the mind; it requires the same\r\neffort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle."\r\n\r\nShe has a large, generous sympathy and absolute fairness of temper. So\r\nfar as she is noticeably different from other people she is less bound\r\nby convention. She has the courage of her metaphors and lets them take\r\nher skyward when we poor self-conscious folk would think them rather\r\ntoo bookish for ordinary conversation. She always says exactly what she\r\nthinks, without fear of the plain truth; yet no one is more tactful and\r\nadroit than she in turning an unpleasant truth so that it will do the\r\nleast possible hurt to the feelings of others. Not all the attention\r\nthat has been paid her since she was a child has made her take herself\r\ntoo seriously. Sometimes she gets started on a very solemn preachment.\r\nThen her teacher calls her an incorrigible little sermonizer, and she\r\nlaughs at herself. Often, however, her sober ideas are not to be laughed\r\nat, for her earnestness carries her listeners with her. There is never\r\nthe least false sententiousness in what she says. She means everything\r\nso thoroughly that her very quotations, her echoes from what she has\r\nread, are in truth original.\r\n\r\nHer logic and her sympathy are in excellent balance. Her sympathy is\r\nof the swift and ministering sort which, fortunately, she has found\r\nso often in other people. And her sympathies go further and shape her\r\nopinions on political and national movements. She was intensely pro-Boer\r\nand wrote a strong argument in favour of Boer independence. When she was\r\ntold of the surrender of the brave little people, her face clouded\r\nand she was silent a few minutes. Then she asked clear, penetrating\r\nquestions about the terms of the surrender, and began to discuss them.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Gilman and Mr. Keith, the teachers who prepared her for\r\ncollege, were struck by her power of constructive reasoning; and she was\r\nexcellent in pure mathematics, though she seems never to have enjoyed\r\nit much. Some of the best of her writing, apart from her fanciful\r\nand imaginative work, is her exposition in examinations and technical\r\nthemes, and in some letters which she found it necessary to write to\r\nclear up misunderstandings, and which are models of close thinking\r\nenforced with sweet vehemence.\r\n\r\nShe is an optimist and an idealist.\r\n\r\n"I hope," she writes in a letter, "that L---- isn\'t too practical, for\r\nif she is, I\'m afraid she\'ll miss a great deal of pleasure."\r\n\r\nIn the diary that she kept at the Wright-Humason School in New York she\r\nwrote on October 18, 1894, "I find that I have four things to learn in\r\nmy school life here, and indeed, in life--to think clearly without hurry\r\nor confusion, to love everybody sincerely, to act in everything with the\r\nhighest motives, and to trust in dear God unhesitatingly."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. EDUCATION\r\n\r\nIt is now sixty-five years since Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe knew that he\r\nhad made his way through Laura Bridgman\'s fingers to her intelligence.\r\nThe names of Laura Bridgman and Helen Keller will always be linked\r\ntogether, and it is necessary to understand what Dr. Howe did for his\r\npupil before one comes to an account of Miss Sullivan\'s work. For Dr.\r\nHowe is the great pioneer on whose work that of Miss Sullivan and other\r\nteachers of the deaf-blind immediately depends.\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Gridley Howe was born in Boston, November 10, 1801, and died\r\nin Boston, January 9, 1876. He was a great philanthropist, interested\r\nespecially in the education of all defectives, the feeble-minded, the\r\nblind, and the deaf. Far in advance of his time he advocated many public\r\nmeasures for the relief of the poor and the diseased, for which he was\r\nlaughed at then, but which have since been put into practice. As head\r\nof the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston, he heard of Laura\r\nBridgman and had her brought to the Institution on October 4, 1837.\r\n\r\nLaura Bridgman was born at Hanover, New Hampshire, December 21, 1829; so\r\nshe was almost eight years old when Dr. Howe began his experiments with\r\nher. At the age of twenty-six months scarlet fever left her without\r\nsight or hearing. She also lost her sense of smell and taste. Dr. Howe\r\nwas an experimental scientist and had in him the spirit of New England\r\ntranscendentalism with its large faith and large charities. Science and\r\nfaith together led him to try to make his way into the soul which he\r\nbelieved was born in Laura Bridgman as in every other human being.\r\nHis plan was to teach Laura by means of raised types. He pasted raised\r\nlabels on objects and made her fit the labels to the objects and the\r\nobjects to the labels. When she had learned in this way to associate\r\nraised words with things, in much the same manner, he says, as a dog\r\nlearns tricks, he began to resolve the words into their letter elements\r\nand to teach her to put together "k-e-y," "c-a-p." His success convinced\r\nhim that language can be conveyed through type to the mind of the\r\nblind-deaf child, who, before education, is in the state of the baby who\r\nhas not learned to prattle; indeed, is in a much worse state, for the\r\nbrain has grown in years without natural nourishment.\r\n\r\nAfter Laura\'s education had progressed for two months with the use only\r\nof raised letters, Dr. Howe sent one of his teachers to learn the manual\r\nalphabet from a deaf-mute. She taught it to Laura, and from that time on\r\nthe manual alphabet was the means of communicating with her.\r\n\r\nAfter the first year or two Dr. Howe did not teach Laura Bridgman\r\nhimself, but gave her over to other teachers, who under his direction\r\ncarried on the work of teaching her language.\r\n\r\nToo much cannot be said in praise of Dr. Howe\'s work. As an investigator\r\nhe kept always the scientist\'s attitude. He never forgot to keep\r\nhis records of Laura Bridgman in the fashion of one who works in\r\na laboratory. The result is, his records of her are systematic and\r\ncareful. From a scientific standpoint it is unfortunate that it was\r\nimpossible to keep such a complete record of Helen Keller\'s development.\r\nThis in itself is a great comment on the difference between Laura\r\nBridgman and Helen Keller. Laura always remained an object of curious\r\nstudy. Helen Keller became so rapidly a distinctive personality that she\r\nkept her teacher in a breathless race to meet the needs of her pupil,\r\nwith no time or strength to make a scientific study.\r\n\r\nIn some ways this is unfortunate. Miss Sullivan knew at the beginning\r\nthat Helen Keller would be more interesting and successful than Laura\r\nBridgman, and she expresses in one of her letters the need of keeping\r\nnotes. But neither temperament nor training allowed her to make her\r\npupil the object of any experiment or observation which did not help in\r\nthe child\'s development. As soon as a thing was done, a definite goal\r\npassed, the teacher did not always look back and describe the way she\r\nhad come. The explanation of the fact was unimportant compared to the\r\nfact itself and the need of hurrying on. There are two other reasons why\r\nMiss Sullivan\'s records are incomplete. It has always been a severe tax\r\non her eyes to write, and she was early discouraged from publishing data\r\nby the inaccurate use made of what she at first supplied.\r\n\r\nWhen she first wrote from Tuscumbia to Mr. Michael Anagnos, Dr. Howes\r\nson-in-law and his successor as Director of the Perkins Institution,\r\nabout her work with her pupil, the Boston papers began at once to\r\npublish exaggerated accounts of Helen Keller. Miss Sullivan protested.\r\nIn a letter dated April 10, 1887, only five weeks after she went to\r\nHelen Keller, she wrote to a friend:\r\n\r\n"--sent me a Boston Herald containing a stupid article about Helen. How\r\nperfectly absurd to say that Helen is \'already talking fluently!\' Why,\r\none might just as well say that a two-year-old child converses fluently\r\nwhen he says \'apple give,\' or \'baby walk go.\' I suppose if you included\r\nhis screaming, crowing, whimpering, grunting, squalling, with occasional\r\nkicks, in his conversation, it might be regarded as fluent--even\r\neloquent. Then it is amusing to read of the elaborate preparation I\r\nunderwent to fit me for the great task my friends entrusted to me. I am\r\nsorry that preparation didn\'t include spelling, it would have saved me\r\nsuch a lot of trouble."\r\n\r\nOn March 4, 1888, she writes in a letter:\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I am heartily glad that I don\'t know all that is being said and\r\nwritten about Helen and myself. I assure you I know quite enough. Nearly\r\nevery mail brings some absurd statement, printed or written. The truth\r\nis not wonderful enough to suit the newspapers; so they enlarge upon it\r\nand invent ridiculous embellishments. One paper has Helen demonstrating\r\nproblems in geometry by means of her playing blocks. I expect to hear\r\nnext that she has written a treatise on the origin and future of the\r\nplanets!"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1887, appeared the first report of the Director of the\r\nPerkins Institution, which deals with Helen Keller. For this report\r\nMiss Sullivan prepared, in reluctant compliance with the request of\r\nMr. Anagnos, an account of her work. This with the extracts from her\r\nletters, scattered through the report, is the first valid source of\r\ninformation about Helen Keller. Of this report Miss Sullivan wrote in a\r\nletter dated October 30, 1887:\r\n\r\n"Have you seen the paper I wrote for the \'report\'? Mr. Anagnos was\r\ndelighted with it. He says Helen\'s progress has been \'a triumphal march\r\nfrom the beginning,\' and he has many flattering things to say about\r\nher teacher. I think he is inclined to exaggerate; at all events, his\r\nlanguage is too glowing, and simple facts are set forth in such a manner\r\nthat they bewilder one. Doubtless the work of the past few months does\r\nseem like a triumphal march to him; but then people seldom see the\r\nhalting and painful steps by which the most insignificant success is\r\nachieved."\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Anagnos was the head of a great institution, what he said had\r\nmuch more effect than the facts in Miss Sullivan\'s account on which he\r\nbased his statements. The newspapers caught Mr. Anagnos\'s spirit and\r\nexaggerated a hundred-fold. In a year after she first went to Helen\r\nKeller, Miss Sullivan found herself and her pupil the centre of a\r\nstupendous fiction. Then the educators all over the world said their\r\nsay and for the most part did not help matters. There grew up a mass of\r\ncontroversial matter which it is amusing to read now. Teachers of the\r\ndeaf proved a priori that what Miss Sullivan had done could not be,\r\nand some discredit was reflected on her statements, because they were\r\nsurrounded by the vague eloquence of Mr. Anagnos. Thus the story of\r\nHelen Keller, incredible when told with moderation, had the misfortune\r\nto be heralded by exaggerated announcements, and naturally met either an\r\nignorant credulity or an incredulous hostility.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1888, another report of the Perkins Institution appeared\r\nwith a second paper by Miss Sullivan, and then nothing official was\r\npublished until November, 1891, when Mr. Anagnos issued the last Perkins\r\nInstitution report containing anything about Helen Keller. For this\r\nreport Miss Sullivan wrote the fullest and largest account she has\r\never written; and in this report appeared the "Frost King," which is\r\ndiscussed fully in a later chapter. Then the controversy waxed fiercer\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nFinding that other people seemed to know so much more about Helen Keller\r\nthan she did, Miss Sullivan kept silent and has been silent for ten\r\nyears, except for her paper in the first volta Bureau Souvenir of Helen\r\nKeller and the paper which, at Dr. Bell\'s request, she prepared in 1894\r\nfor the meeting at Chautauqua of the American Association to Promote the\r\nTeaching of Speech to the Deaf. When Dr. Bell and others tell her, what\r\nis certainly true from an impersonal point of view, that she owes it\r\nto the cause of education to write what she knows, she answers very\r\nproperly that she owes all her time and all her energies to her pupil.\r\n\r\nAlthough Miss Sullivan is still rather amused than distressed when some\r\none, even one of her friends, makes mistakes in published articles\r\nabout her and Miss Keller, still she sees that Miss Keller\'s book should\r\ninclude all the information that the teacher could at present furnish.\r\nSo she consented to the publication of extracts from letters which she\r\nwrote during the first year of her work with her pupil. These letters\r\nwere written to Mrs. Sophia C. Hopkins, the only person to whom Miss\r\nSullivan ever wrote freely. Mrs. Hopkins has been a matron at the\r\nPerkins Institution for twenty years, and during the time that Miss\r\nSullivan was a pupil there she was like a mother to her. In these\r\nletters we have an almost weekly record of Miss Sullivan\'s work. Some of\r\nthe details she had forgotten, as she grew more and more to generalize.\r\nMany people have thought that any attempt to find the principles in\r\nher method would be nothing but a later theory superimposed on Miss\r\nSullivan\'s work. But it is evident that in these letters she was making\r\na clear analysis of what she was doing. She was her own critic, and in\r\nspite of her later declaration, made with her modest carelessness, that\r\nshe followed no particular method, she was very clearly learning from\r\nher task and phrasing at the time principles of education of unique\r\nvalue not only in the teaching of the deaf but in the teaching of all\r\nchildren. The extracts from her letters and reports form an important\r\ncontribution to pedagogy, and more than justify the opinion of Dr.\r\nDaniel C. Gilman, who wrote in 1893, when he was President of Johns\r\nHopkins University:\r\n\r\n"I have just read... your most interesting account of the various steps\r\nyou have taken in the education of your wonderful pupil, and I hope you\r\nwill allow me to express my admiration for the wisdom that has guided\r\nyour methods and the affection which has inspired your labours."\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Anne Mansfield Sullivan was born at Springfield, Massachusetts.\r\nVery early in her life she became almost totally blind, and she entered\r\nthe Perkins Institution October 7, 1880, when she was fourteen years\r\nold. Later her sight was partially restored.\r\n\r\nMr. Anagnos says in his report of 1887: "She was obliged to begin her\r\neducation at the lowest and most elementary point; but she showed from\r\nthe very start that she had in herself the force and capacity which\r\ninsure success.... She has finally reached the goal for which she strove\r\nso bravely. The golden words that Dr. Howe uttered and the example that\r\nhe left passed into her thoughts and heart and helped her on the road\r\nto usefulness; and now she stands by his side as his worthy successor\r\nin one of the most cherished branches of his work.... Miss Sullivan\'s\r\ntalents are of the highest order."\r\n\r\nIn 1886 she graduated from the Perkins Institution. When Captain Keller\r\napplied to the director for a teacher, Mr. Anagnos recommended her. The\r\nonly time she had to prepare herself for the work with her pupil was\r\nfrom August, 1886, when Captain Keller wrote, to February, 1887. During\r\nthis time she read Dr. Howe\'s reports. She was further aided by the fact\r\nthat during the six years of her school life she had lived in the\r\nhouse with Laura Bridgman. It was Dr. Howe who, by his work with Laura\r\nBridgman, made Miss Sullivan\'s work possible: but it was Miss Sullivan\r\nwho discovered the way to teach language to the deaf-blind.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Miss Sullivan had to solve her problems\r\nunaided by previous experience or the assistance of any other teacher.\r\nDuring the first year of her work with Helen Keller, in which she taught\r\nher pupil language, they were in Tuscumbia; and when they came North\r\nand visited the Perkins Institution, Helen Keller was never a regular\r\nstudent there or subject to the discipline of the Institution. The\r\nimpression that Miss Sullivan educated Helen Keller "under the direction\r\nof Mr. Anagnos" is erroneous. In the three years during which at\r\nvarious times Miss Keller and Miss Sullivan were guests of the Perkins\r\nInstitution, the teachers there did not help Miss Sullivan, and Mr.\r\nAnagnos did not even use the manual alphabet with facility as a means\r\nof communication. Mr. Anagnos wrote in the report of the Perkins\r\nInstitution, dated November 27, 1888: "At my urgent request, Helen,\r\naccompanied by her mother and her teacher, came to the North in the\r\nlast week of May, and spent several months with us as our guests....\r\nWe gladly allowed her to use freely our library of embossed books, our\r\ncollection of stuffed animals, sea-shells, models of flowers and plants,\r\nand the rest of our apparatus for instructing the blind through the\r\nsense of touch. I do not doubt that she derived from them much pleasure\r\nand not a little profit. But whether Helen stays at home or makes\r\nvisits in other parts of the country, her education is always under\r\nthe immediate direction and exclusive control of her teacher. No one\r\ninterferes with Miss Sullivan\'s plans, or shares in her tasks. She\r\nhas been allowed entire freedom in the choice of means and methods for\r\ncarrying on her great work; and, as we can judge by the results, she\r\nhas made a most judicious and discreet use of this privilege. What\r\nthe little pupil has thus far accomplished is widely known, and her\r\nwonderful attainments command general admiration; but only those who\r\nare familiar with the particulars of the grand achievement know that the\r\ncredit is largely due to the intelligence, wisdom, sagacity, unremitting\r\nperseverance and unbending will of the instructress, who rescued the\r\nchild from the depths of everlasting night and stillness, and watched\r\nover the different phases of her mental and moral development with\r\nmaternal solicitude and enthusiastic devotion."\r\n\r\nHere follow in order Miss Sullivan\'s letters and the most important\r\npassages from the reports. I have omitted from each succeeding report\r\nwhat has already been explained and does not need to be repeated. For\r\nthe ease of the reader I have, with Miss Sullivan\'s consent, made the\r\nextracts run together continuously and supplied words of connection and\r\nthe resulting necessary changes in syntax, and Miss Sullivan has made\r\nslight changes in the phrasing of her reports and also of her letters,\r\nwhich were carelessly written. I have also italicized a few important\r\npassages. Some of her opinions Miss Sullivan would like to enlarge and\r\nrevise. That remains for her to do at another time. At present we have\r\nhere the fullest record that has been published. The first letter is\r\ndated March 6, 1887, three days after her arrival in Tuscumbia.\r\n\r\n...It was 6.30 when I reached Tuscumbia. I found Mrs. Keller and Mr.\r\nJames Keller waiting for me. They said somebody had met every train for\r\ntwo days. The drive from the station to the house, a distance of one\r\nmile, was very lovely and restful. I was surprised to find Mrs. Keller\r\na very young-looking woman, not much older than myself, I should think.\r\nCaptain Keller met us in the yard and gave me a cheery welcome and a\r\nhearty handshake. My first question was, "Where is Helen?" I tried with\r\nall my might to control the eagerness that made me tremble so that I\r\ncould hardly walk. As we approached the house I saw a child standing in\r\nthe doorway, and Captain Keller said, "There she is. She has known all\r\nday that some one was expected, and she has been wild ever since her\r\nmother went to the station for you." I had scarcely put my foot on the\r\nsteps, when she rushed toward me with such force that she would have\r\nthrown me backward if Captain Keller had not been behind me. She felt\r\nmy face and dress and my bag, which she took out of my hand and tried to\r\nopen. It did not open easily, and she felt carefully to see if there was\r\na keyhole. Finding that there was, she turned to me, making the sign\r\nof turning a key and pointing to the bag. Her mother interfered at this\r\npoint and showed Helen by signs that she must not touch the bag. Her\r\nface flushed, and when her mother attempted to take the bag from her,\r\nshe grew very angry. I attracted her attention by showing her my watch\r\nand letting her hold it in her hand. Instantly the tempest subsided, and\r\nwe went upstairs together. Here I opened the bag, and she went through\r\nit eagerly, probably expecting to find something to eat. Friends had\r\nprobably brought her candy in their bags, and she expected to find some\r\nin mine. I made her understand, by pointing to a trunk in the hall and\r\nto myself and nodding my head, that I had a trunk, and then made the\r\nsign that she had used for eating, and nodded again. She understood in a\r\nflash and ran downstairs to tell her mother, by means of emphatic signs,\r\nthat there was some candy in a trunk for her. She returned in a few\r\nminutes and helped me put away my things. It was too comical to see her\r\nput on my bonnet and cock her head first on one side, then on the other,\r\nand look in the mirror, just as if she could see. Somehow I had expected\r\nto see a pale, delicate child--I suppose I got the idea from Dr. Howe\'s\r\ndescription of Laura Bridgman when she came to the Institution. But\r\nthere\'s nothing pale or delicate about Helen. She is large, strong, and\r\nruddy, and as unrestrained in her movements as a young colt. She has\r\nnone of those nervous habits that are so noticeable and so distressing\r\nin blind children. Her body is well formed and vigorous, and Mrs. Keller\r\nsays she has not been ill a day since the illness that deprived her\r\nof her sight and hearing. She has a fine head, and it is set on her\r\nshoulders just right. Her face is hard to describe. It is intelligent,\r\nbut lacks mobility, or soul, or something. Her mouth is large and finely\r\nshaped. You see at a glance that she is blind. One eye is larger than\r\nthe other, and protrudes noticeably. She rarely smiles; indeed, I have\r\nseen her smile only once or twice since I came. She is unresponsive and\r\neven impatient of caresses from any one except her mother. She is very\r\nquick-tempered and wilful, and nobody, except her brother James, has\r\nattempted to control her. The greatest problem I shall have to solve is\r\nhow to discipline and control her without breaking her spirit. I shall\r\ngo rather slowly at first and try to win her love. I shall not attempt\r\nto conquer her by force alone; but I shall insist on reasonable\r\nobedience from the start. One thing that impresses everybody is Helen\'s\r\ntireless activity. She is never still a moment. She is here, there, and\r\neverywhere. Her hands are in everything; but nothing holds her attention\r\nfor long. Dear child, her restless spirit gropes in the dark. Her\r\nuntaught, unsatisfied hands destroy whatever they touch because they do\r\nnot know what else to do with things.\r\n\r\nShe helped me unpack my trunk when it came, and was delighted when\r\nshe found the doll the little girls sent her. I thought it a good\r\nopportunity to teach her her first word. I spelled "d-o-l-l" slowly in\r\nher hand and pointed to the doll and nodded my head, which seems to be\r\nher sign for possession. Whenever anybody gives her anything, she points\r\nto it, then to herself, and nods her head. She looked puzzled and felt\r\nmy hand, and I repeated the letters. She imitated them very well and\r\npointed to the doll. Then I took the doll, meaning to give it back to\r\nher when she had made the letters; but she thought I meant to take it\r\nfrom her, and in an instant she was in a temper, and tried to seize the\r\ndoll. I shook my head and tried to form the letters with her fingers;\r\nbut she got more and more angry. I forced her into a chair and held her\r\nthere until I was nearly exhausted. Then it occurred to me that it\r\nwas useless to continue the struggle--I must do something to turn the\r\ncurrent of her thoughts. I let her go, but refused to give up the doll.\r\nI went downstairs and got some cake (she is very fond of sweets). I\r\nshowed Helen the cake and spelled "c-a-k-e" in her hand, holding the\r\ncake toward her. Of course she wanted it and tried to take it; but\r\nI spelled the word again and patted her hand. She made the letters\r\nrapidly, and I gave her the cake, which she ate in a great hurry,\r\nthinking, I suppose, that I might take it from her. Then I showed her\r\nthe doll and spelled the word again, holding the doll toward her as I\r\nheld the cake. She made the letters "d-o-l"\' and I made the other "l"\r\nand gave her the doll. She ran downstairs with it and could not be\r\ninduced to return to my room all day.\r\n\r\nYesterday I gave her a sewing-card to do. I made the first row of\r\nvertical lines and let her feel it and notice that there were several\r\nrows of little holes. She began to work delightedly and finished the\r\ncard in a few minutes, and did it very neatly indeed. I thought I would\r\ntry another word; so I spelled "c-a-r-d." She made the "c-a," then\r\nstopped and thought, and making the sign for eating and pointing\r\ndownward she pushed me toward the door, meaning that I must go\r\ndownstairs for some cake. The two letters "c-a," you see, had reminded\r\nher of Fridays "lesson"--not that she had any idea that cake was the\r\nname of the thing, but it was simply a matter of association, I suppose.\r\nI finished the word "c-a-k-e" and obeyed her command. She was delighted.\r\nThen I spelled "d-o-l-l" and began to hunt for it. She follows with her\r\nhands every motion you make, and she knew that I was looking for the\r\ndoll. She pointed down, meaning that the doll was downstairs. I made\r\nthe signs that she had used when she wished me to go for the cake,\r\nand pushed her toward the door. She started forward, then hesitated a\r\nmoment, evidently debating within herself whether she would go or not.\r\nShe decided to send me instead. I shook my head and spelled "d-o-l-l"\r\nmore emphatically, and opened the door for her; but she obstinately\r\nrefused to obey. She had not finished the cake she was eating, and I\r\ntook it away, indicating that if she brought the doll I would give her\r\nback the cake. She stood perfectly still for one long moment, her face\r\ncrimson; then her desire for the cake triumphed, and she ran downstairs\r\nand brought the doll, and of course I gave her the cake, but could not\r\npersuade her to enter the room again.\r\n\r\nShe was very troublesome when I began to write this morning. She kept\r\ncoming up behind me and putting her hand on the paper and into the\r\nink-bottle. These blots are her handiwork. Finally I remembered the\r\nkindergarten beads, and set her to work stringing them. First I put on\r\ntwo wooden beads and one glass bead, then made her feel of the string\r\nand the two boxes of beads. She nodded and began at once to fill the\r\nstring with wooden beads. I shook my head and took them all off and made\r\nher feel of the two wooden beads and the one glass bead. She examined\r\nthem thoughtfully and began again. This time she put on the glass bead\r\nfirst and the two wooden ones next. I took them off and showed her that\r\nthe two wooden ones must go on first, then the glass bead. She had no\r\nfurther trouble and filled the string quickly, too quickly, in fact.\r\nShe tied the ends together when she had finished the string, and put the\r\nbeads round her neck. I did not make the knot large enough in the next\r\nstring, and the beads came off as fast as she put them on; but she\r\nsolved the difficulty herself by putting the string through a bead and\r\ntying it. I thought this very clever. She amused herself with the\r\nbeads until dinner-time, bringing the strings to me now and then for my\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nMy eyes are very much inflamed. I know this letter is very carelessly\r\nwritten. I had a lot to say, and couldn\'t stop to think how to express\r\nthings neatly. Please do not show my letter to any one. If you want to,\r\nyou may read it to my friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday P.M.\r\n\r\nI had a battle royal with Helen this morning. Although I try very hard\r\nnot to force issues, I find it very difficult to avoid them.\r\n\r\nHelen\'s table manners are appalling. She puts her hands in our plates\r\nand helps herself, and when the dishes are passed, she grabs them and\r\ntakes out whatever she wants. This morning I would not let her put\r\nher hand in my plate. She persisted, and a contest of wills followed.\r\nNaturally the family was much disturbed, and left the room. I locked\r\nthe dining-room door, and proceeded to eat my breakfast, though the food\r\nalmost choked me. Helen was lying on the floor, kicking and screaming\r\nand trying to pull my chair from under me. She kept this up for half an\r\nhour, then she got up to see what I was doing. I let her see that I was\r\neating, but did not let her put her hand in the plate. She pinched me,\r\nand I slapped her every time she did it. Then she went all round the\r\ntable to see who was there, and finding no one but me, she seemed\r\nbewildered. After a few minutes she came back to her place and began to\r\neat her breakfast with her fingers. I gave her a spoon, which she threw\r\non the floor. I forced her out of the chair and made her pick it up.\r\nFinally I succeeded in getting her back in her chair again, and held the\r\nspoon in her hand, compelling her to take up the food with it and put\r\nit in her mouth. In a few minutes she yielded and finished her breakfast\r\npeaceably. Then we had another tussle over folding her napkin. When she\r\nhad finished, she threw it on the floor and ran toward the door. Finding\r\nit locked, she began to kick and scream all over again. It was another\r\nhour before I succeeded in getting her napkin folded. Then I let her out\r\ninto the warm sunshine and went up to my room and threw myself on the\r\nbed exhausted. I had a good cry and felt better. I suppose I shall have\r\nmany such battles with the little woman before she learns the only two\r\nessential things I can teach her, obedience and love.\r\n\r\nGood-by, dear. Don\'t worry; I\'ll do my best and leave the rest to\r\nwhatever power manages that which we cannot. I like Mrs. Keller very\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTuscumbia, Alabama, March 11, 1887.\r\n\r\nSince I wrote you, Helen and I have gone to live all by ourselves in\r\na little garden-house about a quarter of a mile from her home, only a\r\nshort distance from Ivy Green, the Keller homestead. I very soon made up\r\nmy mind that I could do nothing with Helen in the midst of the family,\r\nwho have always allowed her to do exactly as she pleased. She has\r\ntyrannized over everybody, her mother, her father, the servants, the\r\nlittle darkies who play with her, and nobody had ever seriously disputed\r\nher will, except occasionally her brother James, until I came; and\r\nlike all tyrants she holds tenaciously to her divine right to do as she\r\npleases. If she ever failed to get what she wanted, it was because of\r\nher inability to make the vassals of her household understand what it\r\nwas. Every thwarted desire was the signal for a passionate outburst, and\r\nas she grew older and stronger, these tempests became more violent. As I\r\nbegan to teach her, I was beset by many difficulties. She wouldn\'t yield\r\na point without contesting it to the bitter end. I couldn\'t coax her\r\nor compromise with her. To get her to do the simplest thing, such as\r\ncombing her hair or washing her hands or buttoning her boots, it was\r\nnecessary to use force, and, of course, a distressing scene followed.\r\nThe family naturally felt inclined to interfere, especially her father,\r\nwho cannot bear to see her cry. So they were all willing to give in for\r\nthe sake of peace. Besides, her past experiences and associations were\r\nall against me. I saw clearly that it was useless to try to teach her\r\nlanguage or anything else until she learned to obey me. I have thought\r\nabout it a great deal, and the more I think, the more certain I am that\r\nobedience is the gateway through which knowledge, yes, and love, too,\r\nenter the mind of the child. As I wrote you, I meant to go slowly at\r\nfirst. I had an idea that I could win the love and confidence of my\r\nlittle pupil by the same means that I should use if she could see and\r\nhear. But I soon found that I was cut off from all the usual approaches\r\nto the child\'s heart. She accepted everything I did for her as a matter\r\nof course, and refused to be caressed, and there was no way of appealing\r\nto her affection or sympathy or childish love of approbation. She would\r\nor she wouldn\'t, and there was an end of it. Thus it is, we study, plan\r\nand prepare ourselves for a task, and when the hour for action arrives,\r\nwe find that the system we have followed with such labour and pride does\r\nnot fit the occasion; and then there\'s nothing for us to do but rely on\r\nsomething within us, some innate capacity for knowing and doing, which\r\nwe did not know we possessed until the hour of our great need brought it\r\nto light.\r\n\r\nI had a good, frank talk with Mrs. Keller, and explained to her how\r\ndifficult it was going to be to do anything with Helen under the\r\nexisting circumstances. I told her that in my opinion the child ought\r\nto be separated from the family for a few weeks at least--that she must\r\nlearn to depend on and obey me before I could make any headway. After a\r\nlong time Mrs. Keller said that she would think the matter over and\r\nsee what Captain Keller thought of sending Helen away with me. Captain\r\nKeller fell in with the scheme most readily and suggested that the\r\nlittle garden-house at the "old place" be got ready for us. He said that\r\nHelen might recognize the place, as she had often been there, but she\r\nwould have no idea of her surroundings, and they could come every day to\r\nsee that all was going well, with the understanding, of course, that she\r\nwas to know nothing of their visits. I hurried the preparations for our\r\ndeparture as much as possible, and here we are.\r\n\r\nThe little house is a genuine bit of paradise. It consists of one large\r\nsquare room with a great fireplace, a spacious bay-window, and a small\r\nroom where our servant, a little negro boy, sleeps. There is a piazza in\r\nfront, covered with vines that grow so luxuriantly that you have to part\r\nthem to see the garden beyond. Our meals are brought from the house,\r\nand we usually eat on the piazza. The little negro boy takes care of the\r\nfire when we need one, so I can give my whole attention to Helen.\r\n\r\nShe was greatly excited at first, and kicked and screamed herself into a\r\nsort of stupor, but when supper was brought she ate heartily and seemed\r\nbrighter, although she refused to let me touch her. She devoted herself\r\nto her dolls the first evening, and when it was bedtime she undressed\r\nvery quietly, but when she felt me get into bed with her, she jumped out\r\non the other side, and nothing that I could do would induce her to get\r\nin again. But I was afraid she would take cold, and I insisted that she\r\nmust go to bed. We had a terrific tussle, I can tell you. The struggle\r\nlasted for nearly two hours. I never saw such strength and endurance in\r\na child. But fortunately for us both, I am a little stronger, and quite\r\nas obstinate when I set out. I finally succeeded in getting her on the\r\nbed and covered her up, and she lay curled up as near the edge of the\r\nbed as possible.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she was very docile, but evidently homesick. She kept\r\ngoing to the door, as if she expected some one, and every now and then\r\nshe would touch her cheek, which is her sign for her mother, and shake\r\nher head sadly. She played with her dolls more than usual, and would\r\nhave nothing to do with me. It is amusing and pathetic to see Helen with\r\nher dolls. I don\'t think she has any special tenderness for them--I\r\nhave never seen her caress them; but she dresses and undresses them many\r\ntimes during the day and handles them exactly as she has seen her mother\r\nand the nurse handle her baby sister.\r\n\r\nThis morning Nancy, her favourite doll, seemed to have some difficulty\r\nabout swallowing the milk that was being administered to her in large\r\nspoonfuls; for Helen suddenly put down the cup and began to slap her on\r\nthe back and turn her over on her knees, trotting her gently and patting\r\nher softly all the time. This lasted for several minutes; then this mood\r\npassed, and Nancy was thrown ruthlessly on the floor and pushed to one\r\nside, while a large, pink-cheeked, fuzzy-haired member of the family\r\nreceived the little mother\'s undivided attention.\r\n\r\nHelen knows several words now, but has no idea how to use them, or that\r\neverything has a name. I think, however, she will learn quickly enough\r\nby and by. As I have said before, she is wonderfully bright and active\r\nand as quick as lightning in her movements.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 13, 1887.\r\n\r\nYou will be glad to hear that my experiment is working out finely. I\r\nhave not had any trouble at all with Helen, either yesterday or to-day.\r\nShe has learned three new words, and when I give her the objects, the\r\nnames of which she has learned, she spells them unhesitatingly; but she\r\nseems glad when the lesson is over.\r\n\r\nWe had a good frolic this morning out in the garden. Helen evidently\r\nknew where she was as soon as she touched the boxwood hedges, and made\r\nmany signs which I did not understand. No doubt they were signs for the\r\ndifferent members of the family at Ivy Green.\r\n\r\nI have just heard something that surprised me very much. It seems that\r\nMr. Anagnos had heard of Helen before he received Captain Keller\'s\r\nletter last summer. Mr. Wilson, a teacher at Florence, and a friend\r\nof the Kellers\', studied at Harvard the summer before and went to the\r\nPerkins Institution to learn if anything could be done for his friend\'s\r\nchild. He saw a gentleman whom he presumed to be the director, and told\r\nhim about Helen. He says the gentleman was not particularly interested,\r\nbut said he would see if anything could be done. Doesn\'t it seem strange\r\nthat Mr. Anagnos never referred to this interview?\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 20, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy heart is singing for joy this morning. A miracle has happened!\r\nThe light of understanding has shone upon my little pupil\'s mind, and\r\nbehold, all things are changed!\r\n\r\nThe wild little creature of two weeks ago has been transformed into\r\na gentle child. She is sitting by me as I write, her face serene and\r\nhappy, crocheting a long red chain of Scotch wool. She learned the\r\nstitch this week, and is very proud of the achievement. When she\r\nsucceeded in making a chain that would reach across the room, she patted\r\nherself on the arm and put the first work of her hands lovingly against\r\nher cheek. She lets me kiss her now, and when she is in a particularly\r\ngentle mood, she will sit in my lap for a minute or two; but she does\r\nnot return my caresses. The great step--the step that counts--has been\r\ntaken. The little savage has learned her first lesson in obedience, and\r\nfinds the yoke easy. It now remains my pleasant task to direct and mould\r\nthe beautiful intelligence that is beginning to stir in the child-soul.\r\nAlready people remark the change in Helen. Her father looks in at us\r\nmorning and evening as he goes to and from his office, and sees her\r\ncontentedly stringing her beads or making horizontal lines on her\r\nsewing-card, and exclaims, "How quiet she is!" When I came, her\r\nmovements were so insistent that one always felt there was something\r\nunnatural and almost weird about her. I have noticed also that she eats\r\nmuch less, a fact which troubles her father so much that he is anxious\r\nto get her home. He says she is homesick. I don\'t agree with him; but I\r\nsuppose we shall have to leave our little bower very soon.\r\n\r\nHelen has learned several nouns this week. "M-u-g" and "m-i-l-k," have\r\ngiven her more trouble than other words. When she spells "milk," she\r\npoints to the mug, and when she spells "mug," she makes the sign for\r\npouring or drinking, which shows that she has confused the words. She\r\nhas no idea yet that everything has a name.\r\n\r\nYesterday I had the little negro boy come in when Helen was having\r\nher lesson, and learn the letters, too. This pleased her very much and\r\nstimulated her ambition to excel Percy. She was delighted if he made\r\na mistake, and made him form the letter over several times. When he\r\nsucceeded in forming it to suit her, she patted him on his woolly head\r\nso vigorously that I thought some of his slips were intentional.\r\n\r\nOne day this week Captain Keller brought Belle, a setter of which he\r\nis very proud, to see us. He wondered if Helen would recognize her old\r\nplaymate. Helen was giving Nancy a bath, and didn\'t notice the dog at\r\nfirst. She usually feels the softest step and throws out her arms to\r\nascertain if any one is near her. Belle didn\'t seem very anxious to\r\nattract her attention. I imagine she has been rather roughly handled\r\nsometimes by her little mistress. The dog hadn\'t been in the room more\r\nthan half a minute, however, before Helen began to sniff, and dumped\r\nthe doll into the wash-bowl and felt about the room. She stumbled\r\nupon Belle, who was crouching near the window where Captain Keller was\r\nstanding. It was evident that she recognized the dog; for she put her\r\narms round her neck and squeezed her. Then Helen sat down by her and\r\nbegan to manipulate her claws. We couldn\'t think for a second what she\r\nwas doing; but when we saw her make the letters "d-o-l-l" on her own\r\nfingers, we knew that she was trying to teach Belle to spell.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 28, 1887.\r\n\r\nHelen and I came home yesterday. I am sorry they wouldn\'t let us\r\nstay another week; but I think I have made the most I could of the\r\nopportunities that were mine the past two weeks, and I don\'t expect that\r\nI shall have any serious trouble with Helen in the future. The back of\r\nthe greatest obstacle in the path of progress is broken. I think "no"\r\nand "yes," conveyed by a shake or a nod of my head, have become facts\r\nas apparent to her as hot and cold or as the difference between pain and\r\npleasure. And I don\'t intend that the lesson she has learned at the cost\r\nof so much pain and trouble shall be unlearned. I shall stand between\r\nher and the over-indulgence of her parents. I have told Captain and Mrs.\r\nKeller that they must not interfere with me in any way. I have done my\r\nbest to make them see the terrible injustice to Helen of allowing her to\r\nhave her way in everything, and I have pointed out that the processes of\r\nteaching the child that everything cannot be as he wills it, are apt to\r\nbe painful both to him and to his teacher. They have promised to let me\r\nhave a free hand and help me as much as possible. The improvement they\r\ncannot help seeing in their child has given them more confidence in me.\r\nOf course, it is hard for them. I realize that it hurts to see their\r\nafflicted little child punished and made to do things against her will.\r\nOnly a few hours after my talk with Captain and Mrs. Keller (and they\r\nhad agreed to everything), Helen took a notion that she wouldn\'t use\r\nher napkin at table. I think she wanted to see what would happen. I\r\nattempted several times to put the napkin round her neck; but each time\r\nshe tore it off and threw it on the floor and finally began to kick the\r\ntable. I took her plate away and started to take her out of the room.\r\nHer father objected and said that no child of his should be deprived of\r\nhis food on any account.\r\n\r\nHelen didn\'t come up to my room after supper, and I didn\'t see her again\r\nuntil breakfast-time. She was at her place when I came down. She had put\r\nthe napkin under her chin, instead of pinning it at the back, as was her\r\ncustom. She called my attention to the new arrangement, and when I did\r\nnot object she seemed pleased and patted herself. When she left the\r\ndining-room, she took my hand and patted it. I wondered if she was\r\ntrying to "make up." I thought I would try the effect of a little\r\nbelated discipline. I went back to the dining-room and got a napkin.\r\nWhen Helen came upstairs for her lesson, I arranged the objects on the\r\ntable as usual, except that the cake, which I always give her in bits\r\nas a reward when she spells a word quickly and correctly, was not there.\r\nShe noticed this at once and made the sign for it. I showed her the\r\nnapkin and pinned it round her neck, then tore it off and threw it on\r\nthe floor and shook my head. I repeated this performance several times.\r\nI think she understood perfectly well; for she slapped her hand two or\r\nthree times and shook her head. We began the lesson as usual. I gave\r\nher an object, and she spelled the name (she knows twelve now). After\r\nspelling half the words, she stopped suddenly, as if a thought had\r\nflashed into her mind, and felt for the napkin. She pinned it round her\r\nneck and made the sign for cake (it didn\'t occur to her to spell the\r\nword, you see). I took this for a promise that if I gave her some cake\r\nshe would be a good girl. I gave her a larger piece than usual, and she\r\nchuckled and patted herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 3, 1887.\r\n\r\nWe almost live in the garden, where everything is growing and blooming\r\nand glowing. After breakfast we go out and watch the men at work. Helen\r\nloves to dig and play in the dirt like any other child. This morning she\r\nplanted her doll and showed me that she expected her to grow as tall\r\nas I. You must see that she is very bright, but you have no idea how\r\ncunning she is.\r\n\r\nAt ten we come in and string beads for a few minutes. She can make a\r\ngreat many combinations now, and often invents new ones herself. Then I\r\nlet her decide whether she will sew or knit or crochet. She learned to\r\nknit very quickly, and is making a wash-cloth for her mother. Last week\r\nshe made her doll an apron, and it was done as well as any child of her\r\nage could do it. But I am always glad when this work is over for the\r\nday. Sewing and crocheting are inventions of the devil, I think. I\'d\r\nrather break stones on the king\'s highway than hem a handkerchief. At\r\neleven we have gymnastics. She knows all the free-hand movements and the\r\n"Anvil Chorus" with the dumb-bells. Her father says he is going to fit\r\nup a gymnasium for her in the pump-house; but we both like a good romp\r\nbetter than set exercises. The hour from twelve to one is devoted to\r\nthe learning of new words. BUT YOU MUSTN\'T THINK THIS IS THE ONLY TIME\r\nI SPELL TO HELEN; FOR I SPELL IN HER HAND EVERYTHING WE DO ALL DAY LONG,\r\nALTHOUGH SHE HAS NO IDEA AS YET WHAT THE SPELLING MEANS. After dinner I\r\nrest for an hour, and Helen plays with her dolls or frolics in the yard\r\nwith the little darkies, who were her constant companions before I came.\r\nLater I join them, and we make the rounds of the outhouses. We visit the\r\nhorses and mules in their stalls and hunt for eggs and feed the turkeys.\r\nOften, when the weather is fine, we drive from four to six, or go to see\r\nher aunt at Ivy Green or her cousins in the town. Helen\'s instincts are\r\ndecidedly social; she likes to have people about her and to visit her\r\nfriends, partly, I think, because they always have things she likes\r\nto eat. After supper we go to my room and do all sorts of things until\r\neight, when I undress the little woman and put her to bed. She sleeps\r\nwith me now. Mrs. Keller wanted to get a nurse for her, but I concluded\r\nI\'d rather be her nurse than look after a stupid, lazy negress. Besides,\r\nI like to have Helen depend on me for everything, AND I FIND IT MUCH\r\nEASIER TO TEACH HER THINGS AT ODD MOMENTS THAN AT SET TIMES.\r\n\r\nOn March 31st I found that Helen knew eighteen nouns and three verbs.\r\nHere is a list of the words. Those with a cross after them are words she\r\nasked for herself: DOLL, MUG, PIN, KEY, DOG, HAT, CUP, BOX, WATER, MILK,\r\nCANDY, EYE (X), FINGER (X), TOE (X), HEAD (X), CAKE, BABY, MOTHER, SIT,\r\nSTAND, WALK. On April 1st she learned the nouns KNIFE, FORK, SPOON,\r\nSAUCER, TEA, PAPA, BED, and the verb RUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 5, 1887.\r\n\r\nI must write you a line this morning because something very important\r\nhas happened. Helen has taken the second great step in her education.\r\nShe has learned that EVERYTHING HAS A NAME, AND THAT THE MANUAL ALPHABET\r\nIS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING SHE WANTS TO KNOW.\r\n\r\nIn a previous letter I think I wrote you that "mug" and "milk" had given\r\nHelen more trouble than all the rest. She confused the nouns with the\r\nverb "drink." She didn\'t know the word for "drink," but went through\r\nthe pantomime of drinking whenever she spelled "mug" or "milk." This\r\nmorning, while she was washing, she wanted to know the name for "water."\r\nWhen she wants to know the name of anything, she points to it and pats\r\nmy hand. I spelled "w-a-t-e-r" and thought no more about it until after\r\nbreakfast. Then it occurred to me that with the help of this new word\r\nI might succeed in straightening out the "mug-milk" difficulty. We went\r\nout to the pump-house, and I made Helen hold her mug under the spout\r\nwhile I pumped. As the cold water gushed forth, filling the mug, I\r\nspelled "w-a-t-e-r" in Helen\'s free hand. The word coming so close upon\r\nthe sensation of cold water rushing over her hand seemed to startle her.\r\nShe dropped the mug and stood as one transfixed. A new light came into\r\nher face. She spelled "water" several times. Then she dropped on the\r\nground and asked for its name and pointed to the pump and the trellis,\r\nand suddenly turning round she asked for my name. I spelled "Teacher."\r\nJust then the nurse brought Helen\'s little sister into the pump-house,\r\nand Helen spelled "baby" and pointed to the nurse. All the way back to\r\nthe house she was highly excited, and learned the name of every object\r\nshe touched, so that in a few hours she had adDED THIRTY NEW WORDS TO\r\nHER VOCABULARY. HERE ARE SOME OF THEM: DOOR, OPEN, SHUT, GIVE, GO, COME,\r\nand a great many more.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I didn\'t finish my letter in time to get it posted last night; so\r\nI shall add a line. Helen got up this morning like a radiant fairy. She\r\nhas flitted from object to object, asking the name of everything and\r\nkissing me for very gladness. Last night when I got in bed, she stole\r\ninto my arms of her own accord and kissed me for the first time, and I\r\nthought my heart would burst, so full was it of joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 10, 1887.\r\n\r\nI see an improvement in Helen day to day, almost from hour to hour.\r\nEverything must have a name now. Wherever we go, she asks eagerly for\r\nthe names of things she has not learned at home. She is anxious for her\r\nfriends to spell, and eager to teach the letters to every one she meets.\r\nShe drops the signs and pantomime she used before, as soon as she has\r\nwords to supply their place, and the acquirement of a new word affords\r\nher the liveliest pleasure. And we notice that her face grows more\r\nexpressive each day.\r\n\r\nI HAVE DECIDED NOT TO TRY TO HAVE REGULAR LESSONS FOR THE PRESENT. I AM\r\nGOING TO TREAT HELEN EXACTLY LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD. IT OCCURRED\r\nTO ME THE OTHER DAY THAT IT IS ABSURD TO REQUIRE A CHILD TO COME TO A\r\nCERTAIN PLACE AT A CERTAIN TIME AND RECITE CERTAIN LESSONS, WHEN HE HAS\r\nNOT YET ACQUIRED A WORKING VOCABULARY. I sent Helen away and sat down\r\nto think. I asked myself, "How does a normal child learn language?" The\r\nanswer was simple, "By imitation." The child comes into the world with\r\nthe ability to learn, and he learns of himself, provided he is supplied\r\nwith sufficient outward stimulus. He sees people do things, and he\r\ntries to do them. He hears others speak, and he tried to speak. BUT LONG\r\nBEFORE HE UTTERS HIS FIRST WORD, HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS SAID TO HIM. I\r\nhave been observing Helen\'s little cousin lately. She is about fifteen\r\nmonths old, and already understands a great deal. In response to\r\nquestions she points out prettily her nose, mouth, eye, chin, cheek,\r\near. If I say, "Where is baby\'s other ear?" she points it out correctly.\r\nIf I hand her a flower, and say, "Give it to mamma," she takes it to\r\nher mother. If I say, "Where is the little rogue?" she hides behind her\r\nmother\'s chair, or covers her face with her hands and peeps out at me\r\nwith an expression of genuine roguishness. She obeys many commands\r\nlike these: "Come," "Kiss," "Go to papa," "Shut the door," "Give me\r\nthe biscuit." But I have not heard her try to say any of these words,\r\nalthough they have been repeated hundreds of times in her hearing, and\r\nit is perfectly evident that she understands them. These observations\r\nhave given me a clue to the method to be followed in teaching Helen\r\nlanguage.I SHALL TALK INTO HER HAND AS WE TALK INTO THE BABY\'S EARS. I\r\nshall assume that she has the normal child\'s capacity of assimilation\r\nand imitation. I SHALL USE COMPLETE SENTENCES IN TALKING TO HER, and\r\nfill out the meaning with gestures and her descriptive signs when\r\nnecessity requires it; but I shall not try to keep her mind fixed on any\r\none thing. I shall do all I can to interest and stimulate it, and wait\r\nfor results.\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 24, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe new scheme works splendidly. Helen knows the meaning of more than\r\na hundred words now, and learns new ones daily without the slightest\r\nsuspicion that she is performing a most difficult feat. She learns\r\nbecause she can\'t help it, just as the bird learns to fly. But don\'t\r\nimagine that she "talks fluently." Like her baby cousin, she expresses\r\nwhole sentences by single words. "Milk," with a gesture means, "Give me\r\nmore milk." "Mother," accompanied by an inquiring look, means, "Were is\r\nmother?" "Go" means, "I want to go out." But when I spell into her hand,\r\n"Give me some bread," she hands me the bread, or if I say, "Get your hat\r\nand we will go to walk," she obeys instantly. The two words, "hat" and\r\n"walk" would have the same effect; BUT THE WHOLE SENTENCE, REPEATED MANY\r\nTIMES DURING THE DAY, MUST IN TIME IMPRESS ITSELF UPON THE BRAIN, AND BY\r\nAND BY SHE WILL USE IT HERSELF.\r\n\r\nWe play a little game which I find most useful in developing the\r\nintellect, and which incidentally answers the purpose of a language\r\nlesson. It is an adaptation of hide-the-thimble. I hide something, a\r\nball or a spool, and we hunt for it. When we first played this game two\r\nor three days ago, she showed no ingenuity at all in finding the object.\r\nShe looked in places where it would have been impossible to put the ball\r\nor the spool. For instance, when I hid the ball, she looked under her\r\nwriting-board. Again, when I hid the spool, she looked for it in a\r\nlittle box not more than an inch long; and she very soon gave up the\r\nsearch. Now I can keep up her interest in the game for an hour or\r\nlonger, and she shows much more intelligence, and often great ingenuity\r\nin the search. This morning I hid a cracker. She looked everywhere\r\nshe could think of without success, and was evidently in despair when\r\nsuddenly a thought struck her, and she came running to me and made me\r\nopen my mouth very wide, while she gave it a thorough investigation.\r\nFinding no trace of the cracker there, she pointed to my stomach and\r\nspelled "eat," meaning, "Did you eat it?"\r\n\r\nFriday we went down town and met a gentleman who gave Helen some candy,\r\nwhich she ate, except one small piece which she put in her apron pocket.\r\nWhen we reached home, she found her mother, and of her own accord said,\r\n"Give baby candy." Mrs. Keller spelled, "No--baby eat--no." Helen went\r\nto the cradle and felt of Mildred\'s mouth and pointed to her own teeth.\r\nMrs. Keller spelled "teeth." Helen shook her head and spelled "Baby\r\nteeth--no, baby eat--no," meaning of course, "Baby cannot eat because\r\nshe has no teeth."\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 8, 1887.\r\n\r\nNo, I don\'t want any more kindergarten materials. I used my little stock\r\nof beads, cards and straws at first because I didn\'t know what else to\r\ndo; but the need for them is past, for the present at any rate.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to suspect all elaborate and special systems of\r\neducation. They seem to me to be built up on the supposition that every\r\nchild is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think. Whereas, if\r\nthe child is left to himself, he will think more and better, if less\r\nshowily. Let him go and come freely, let him touch real things and\r\ncombine his impressions for himself, instead of sitting indoors at a\r\nlittle round table, while a sweet-voiced teacher suggests that he build\r\na stone wall with his wooden blocks, or make a rainbow out of strips of\r\ncoloured paper, or plant straw trees in bead flower-pots. Such teaching\r\nfills the mind with artificial associations that must be got rid\r\nof, before the child can develop independent ideas out of actual\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nHelen is learning adjectives and adverbs as easily as she learned nouns.\r\nThe idea always precedes the word. She had signs for SMALL and LARGE\r\nlong before I came to her. If she wanted a small object and was given a\r\nlarge one, she would shake her head and take up a tiny bit of the skin\r\nof one hand between the thumb and finger of the other. If she wanted to\r\nindicate something large, she spread the fingers of both hands as wide\r\nas she could, and brought them together, as if to clasp a big ball. The\r\nother day I substituted the words SMALL and LARGE for these signs, and\r\nshe at once adopted the words and discarded the signs. I can now tell\r\nher to bring me a large book or a small plate, to go upstairs slowly, to\r\nrun fast and to walk quickly. This morning she used the conjunction AND\r\nfor the first time. I told her to shut the door, and she added, "and\r\nlock."\r\n\r\nShe came tearing upstairs a few minutes ago in a state of great\r\nexcitement. I couldn\'t make out at first what it was all about. She kept\r\nspelling "dog--baby" and pointing to her five fingers one after another,\r\nand sucking them. My first thought was, one of the dogs has hurt\r\nMildred; but Helen\'s beaming face set my fears at rest. Nothing would\r\ndo but I must go somewhere with her to see something. She led the way to\r\nthe pump-house, and there in the corner was one of the setters with five\r\ndear little pups! I taught her the word "puppy" and drew her hand\r\nover them all, while they sucked, and spelled "puppies." She was much\r\ninterested in the feeding process, and spelled "mother-dog" and "baby"\r\nseveral times. Helen noticed that the puppies\' eyes were closed, and\r\nshe said, "Eyes--shut. Sleep--no," meaning, "The eyes are shut, but the\r\npuppies are not asleep." She screamed with glee when the little things\r\nsquealed and squirmed in their efforts to get back to their mother, and\r\nspelled, "Baby--eat large." I suppose her idea was "Baby eats much." She\r\npointed to each puppy, one after another, and to her five fingers, and I\r\ntaught her the word FIVE. Then she held up one finger and said "baby."\r\nI knew she was thinking of Mildred, and I spelled, "One baby and five\r\npuppies." After she had played with them a little while, the thought\r\noccurred to her that the puppies must have special names, like people,\r\nand she asked for the name of each pup. I told her to ask her father,\r\nand she said, "No--mother." She evidently thought mothers were more\r\nlikely to know about babies of all sorts. She noticed that one of the\r\npuppies was much smaller than the others, and she spelled "small,"\r\nmaking the sign at the same time, and I said "very small." She evidently\r\nunderstood that VERY was the name of the new thing that had come into\r\nher head; for all the way back to the house she used the word VERY\r\ncorrectly. One stone was "small," another was "very small." When she\r\ntouched her little sister, she said: "Baby--small. Puppy--very small."\r\nSoon after, she began to vary her steps from large to small, and little\r\nmincing steps were "very small." She is going through the house now,\r\napplying the new words to all kinds of objects.\r\n\r\nSince I have abandoned the idea of regular lessons, I find that Helen\r\nlearns much faster. I am convinced that the time spent by the teacher\r\nin digging out of the child what she has put into him, for the sake of\r\nsatisfying herself that it has taken root, is so much time thrown away.\r\nIT\'S MUCH BETTER, I THINK, TO ASSUME THAT THE CHILD IS DOING HIS PART,\r\nAND THAT THE SEED YOU HAVE SOWN WILL BEAR FRUIT IN DUE TIME. It\'s only\r\nfair to the child, anyhow, and it saves you much unnecessary trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 16, 1887.\r\n\r\nWe have begun to take long walks every morning, immediately after\r\nbreakfast. The weather is fine, and the air is full of the scent of\r\nstrawberries. Our objective point is Keller\'s Landing, on the Tennessee,\r\nabout two miles distant. We never know how we get there, or where we are\r\nat a given moment; but that only adds to our enjoyment, especially when\r\neverything is new and strange. Indeed, I feel as if I had never seen\r\nanything until now, Helen finds so much to ask about along the way. We\r\nchase butterflies, and sometimes catch one. Then we sit down under a\r\ntree, or in the shade of a bush, and talk about it. Afterwards, if it\r\nhas survived the lesson, we let it go; but usually its life and beauty\r\nare sacrificed on the altar of learning, though in another sense it\r\nlives forever; for has it not been transformed into living thoughts? It\r\nis wonderful how words generate ideas! Every new word Helen learns seems\r\nto carry with it necessity for many more. Her mind grows through its\r\nceaseless activity.\r\n\r\nKeller\'s Landing was used during the war to land troops, but has long\r\nsince gone to pieces, and is overgrown with moss and weeds. The solitude\r\nof the place sets one dreaming. Near the landing there is a beautiful\r\nlittle spring, which Helen calls "squirrel-cup," because I told her the\r\nsquirrels came there to drink. She has felt dead squirrels and rabbits\r\nand other wild animals, and is anxious to see a "walk-squirrel,"\r\nwhich interpreted, means, I think, a "live squirrel." We go home about\r\ndinner-time usually, and Helen is eager to tell her mother everything\r\nshe has seen. THIS DESIRE TO REPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD HER SHOWS A\r\nMARKED ADVANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER INTELLECT, AND IS AN INVALUABLE\r\nSTIMULUS TO THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGE. I ASK ALL HER FRIENDS TO\r\nENCOURAGE HER TO TELL THEM OF HER DOINGS, AND TO MANIFEST AS MUCH\r\nCURIOSITY AND PLEASURE IN HER LITTLE ADVENTURES AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN.\r\nThis gratifies the child\'s love of approbation and keeps up her interest\r\nin things. This is the basis of real intercourse. She makes many\r\nmistakes, of course, twists words and phrases, puts the cart before the\r\nhorse, and gets herself into hopeless tangles of nouns and verbs; but so\r\ndoes the hearing child. I am sure these difficulties will take care of\r\nthemselves. The impulse to tell is the important thing. I supply a word\r\nhere and there, sometimes a sentence, and suggest something which she\r\nhas omitted or forgotten. Thus her vocabulary grows apace, and the new\r\nwords germinate and bring forth new ideas; and they are the stuff out of\r\nwhich heaven and earth are made.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 22, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy work grows more absorbing and interesting every day. Helen is a\r\nwonderful child, so spontaneous and eager to learn. She knows about 300\r\nwords now and A GREAT MANY COMMON IDIOMS, and it is not three months yet\r\nsince she learned her first word. It is a rare privilege to watch\r\nthe birth, growth, and first feeble struggles of a living mind; this\r\nprivilege is mine; and moreover, it is given me to rouse and guide this\r\nbright intelligence.\r\n\r\nIf only I were better fitted for the great task! I feel every day more\r\nand more inadequate. My mind is full of ideas; but I cannot get them\r\ninto working shape. You see, my mind is undisciplined, full of skips\r\nand jumps, and here and there a lot of things huddled together in dark\r\ncorners. How I long to put it in order! Oh, if only there were some one\r\nto help me! I need a teacher quite as much as Helen. I know that the\r\neducation of this child will be the distinguishing event of my life, if\r\nI have the brains and perseverance to accomplish it. I have made up my\r\nmind about one thing: Helen must learn to use books--indeed, we must\r\nboth learn to use them, and that reminds me--will you please ask Mr.\r\nAnagnos to get me Perez\'s and Sully\'s Psychologies? I think I shall find\r\nthem helpful.\r\n\r\nWe have reading lessons every day. Usually we take one of the little\r\n"Readers" up in a big tree near the house and spend an hour or two\r\nfinding the words Helen already knows. WE MAKE A SORT OF GAME OF IT and\r\ntry to see who can find the words most quickly, Helen with her fingers,\r\nor I with my eyes, and she learns as many new words as I can explain\r\nwith the help of those she knows. When her fingers light upon words she\r\nknows, she fairly screams with pleasure and hugs and kisses me for joy,\r\nespecially if she thinks she has me beaten. It would astonish you to see\r\nhow many words she learns in an hour in this pleasant manner. Afterward\r\nI put the new words into little sentences in the frame, and sometimes it\r\nis possible to tell a little story about a bee or a cat or a little boy\r\nin this way. I can now tell her to go upstairs or down, out of doors\r\nor into the house, lock or unlock a door, take or bring objects, sit,\r\nstand, walk, run, lie, creep, roll, or climb. She is delighted with\r\naction-words; so it is no trouble at all to teach her verbs. She is\r\nalways ready for a lesson, and the eagerness with which she absorbs\r\nideas is very delightful. She is as triumphant over the conquest of a\r\nsentence as a general who has captured the enemy\'s stronghold.\r\n\r\nOne of Helen\'s old habits, that is strongest and hardest to correct, is\r\na tendency to break things. If she finds anything in her way, she flings\r\nit on the floor, no matter what it is: a glass, a pitcher, or even a\r\nlamp. She has a great many dolls, and every one of them has been broken\r\nin a fit of temper or ennui. The other day a friend brought her a new\r\ndoll from Memphis, and I thought I would see if I could make Helen\r\nunderstand that she must not break it. I made her go through the motion\r\nof knocking the doll\'s head on the table and spelled to her: "No,\r\nno, Helen is naughty. Teacher is sad," and let her feel the grieved\r\nexpression on my face. Then I made her caress the doll and kiss the hurt\r\nspot and hold it gently in her arms, and I spelled to her, "Good Helen,\r\nteacher is happy," and let her feel the smile on my face. She went\r\nthrough these motions several times, mimicking every movement, then she\r\nstood very still for a moment with a troubled look on her face, which\r\nsuddenly cleared, and she spelled, "Good Helen," and wreathed her face\r\nin a very large, artificial smile. Then she carried the doll upstairs\r\nand put it on the top shelf of the wardrobe, and she has not touched it\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nPlease give my kind regards to Mr. Anagnos and let him see my letter, if\r\nyou think best. I hear there is a deaf and blind child being educated at\r\nthe Baltimore Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 2, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe weather is scorching. We need rain badly. We are all troubled about\r\nHelen. She is very nervous and excitable. She is restless at night and\r\nhas no appetite. It is hard to know what to do with her. The doctor says\r\nher mind is too active; but how are we to keep her from thinking? She\r\nbegins to spell the minute she wakes up in the morning, and continues\r\nall day long. If I refuse to talk to her, she spells into her own hand,\r\nand apparently carries on the liveliest conversation with herself.\r\n\r\nI gave her my braille slate to play with, thinking that the mechanical\r\npricking of holes in the paper would amuse her and rest her mind. But\r\nwhat was my astonishment when I found that the little witch was writing\r\nletters! I had no idea she knew what a letter was. She has often\r\ngone with me to the post-office to mail letters, and I suppose I have\r\nrepeated to her things I wrote to you. She knew, too, that I sometimes\r\nwrite "letters to blind girls" on the slate; but I didn\'t suppose that\r\nshe had any clear idea what a letter was. One day she brought me a sheet\r\nthat she had punched full of holes, and wanted to put it in an envelope\r\nand take it to the post-office. She said, "Frank--letter." I asked\r\nher what she had written to Frank. She replied, "Much words. Puppy\r\nmotherdog--five. Baby--cry. Hot. Helen walk--no. Sunfire--bad.\r\nFrank--come. Helen--kiss Frank. Strawberries--very good."\r\n\r\nHelen is almost as eager to read as she is to talk. I find she grasps\r\nthe import of whole sentences, catching from the context the meaning\r\nof words she doesn\'t know; and her eager questions indicate the outward\r\nreaching of her mind and its unusual powers.\r\n\r\nThe other night when I went to bed, I found Helen sound asleep with a\r\nbig book clasped tightly in her arms. She had evidently been reading,\r\nand fallen asleep. When I asked her about it in the morning, she said,\r\n"Book--cry," and completed her meaning by shaking and other signs of\r\nfear. I taught her the word AFRAID, and she said: "Helen is not afraid.\r\nBook is afraid. Book will sleep with girl." I told her that the book\r\nwasn\'t afraid, and must sleep in its case, and that "girl" mustn\'t read\r\nin bed. She looked very roguish, and apparently understood that I saw\r\nthrough her ruse.\r\n\r\nI am glad Mr. Anagnos thinks so highly of me as a teacher. But "genius"\r\nand "originality" are words we should not use lightly. If, indeed, they\r\napply to me even remotely, I do not see that I deserve any laudation on\r\nthat account.\r\n\r\nAnd right here I want to say something which is for your ears alone.\r\nSomething within me tells me that I shall succeed beyond my dreams. Were\r\nit not for some circumstances that make such an idea highly improbable,\r\neven absurd, I should think Helen\'s education would surpass in interest\r\nand wonder Dr. Howe\'s achievement. I know that she has remarkable\r\npowers, and I believe that I shall be able to develop and mould them. I\r\ncannot tell how I know these things. I had no idea a short time ago how\r\nto go to work; I was feeling about in the dark; but somehow I know\r\nnow, and I know that I know. I cannot explain it; but when difficulties\r\narise, I am not perplexed or doubtful. I know how to meet them; I seem\r\nto divine Helen\'s peculiar needs. It is wonderful.\r\n\r\nAlready people are taking a deep interest in Helen. No one can see her\r\nwithout being impressed. She is no ordinary child, and people\'s interest\r\nin her education will be no ordinary interest. Therefore let us be\r\nexceedingly careful what we say and write about her. I shall write\r\nfreely to you and tell you everything, on one condition: It is this:\r\nyou must promise never to show my letters to any one. My beautiful Helen\r\nshall not be transformed into a prodigy if I can help it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 5, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe heat makes Helen languid and quiet. Indeed, the Tophetic weather\r\nhas reduced us all to a semi-liquid state. Yesterday Helen took off her\r\nclothes and sat in her skin all the afternoon. When the sun got round to\r\nthe window where she was sitting with her book, she got up impatiently\r\nand shut the window. But when the sun came in just the same, she came\r\nover to me with a grieved look and spelled emphatically: "Sun is bad\r\nboy. Sun must go to bed."\r\n\r\nShe is the dearest, cutest little thing now, and so loving! One day,\r\nwhen I wanted her to bring me some water, she said: "Legs very tired.\r\nLegs cry much."\r\n\r\nShe is much interested in some little chickens that are pecking their\r\nway into the world this morning. I let her hold a shell in her hand, and\r\nfeel the chicken "chip, chip." Her astonishment, when she felt the tiny\r\ncreature inside, cannot be put in a letter. The hen was very gentle, and\r\nmade no objection to our investigations. Besides the chickens, we have\r\nseveral other additions to the family--two calves, a colt, and a penful\r\nof funny little pigs. You would be amused to see me hold a squealing\r\npig in my arms, while Helen feels it all over, and asks countless\r\nquestions--questions not easy to answer either. After seeing the chicken\r\ncome out of the egg, she asked: "Did baby pig grow in egg? Where are\r\nmany shells?"\r\n\r\nHelen\'s head measures twenty and one-half inches, and mine measures\r\ntwenty-one and one-half inches. You see, I\'m only one inch ahead!\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 12, 1887.\r\n\r\nThe weather continues hot. Helen is about the same--pale and thin; but\r\nyou mustn\'t think she is really ill. I am sure the heat, and not\r\nthe natural, beautiful activity of her mind, is responsible for her\r\ncondition. Of course, I shall not overtax her brain. We are bothered a\r\ngood deal by people who assume the responsibility of the world when God\r\nis neglectful. They tell us that Helen is "overdoing," that her mind\r\nis too active (these very people thought she had no mind at all a few\r\nmonths ago!) and suggest many absurd and impossible remedies. But so far\r\nnobody seems to have thought of chloroforming her, which is, I\r\nthink, the only effective way of stopping the natural exercise of her\r\nfaculties. It\'s queer how ready people always are with advice in any\r\nreal or imaginary emergency, and no matter how many times experience has\r\nshown them to be wrong, they continue to set forth their opinions, as if\r\nthey had received them from the Almighty!\r\n\r\nI am teaching Helen the square-hand letters as a sort of diversion.\r\nIt gives her something to do, and keeps her quiet, which I think is\r\ndesirable while this enervating weather lasts. She has a perfect mania\r\nfor counting. She has counted everything in the house, and is now busy\r\ncounting the words in her primer. I hope it will not occur to her to\r\ncount the hairs of her head. If she could see and hear, I suppose\r\nshe would get rid of her superfluous energy in ways which would not,\r\nperhaps, tax her brain so much, although I suspect that the ordinary\r\nchild takes his play pretty seriously. The little fellow who whirls his\r\n"New York Flyer" round the nursery, making "horseshoe curves" undreamed\r\nof by less imaginative engineers, is concentrating his whole soul on his\r\ntoy locomotive.\r\n\r\nShe just came to say, with a worried expression, "Girl--not count\r\nvery large (many) words." I said, "No, go and play with Nancy." This\r\nsuggestion didn\'t please her, however; for she replied, "No. Nancy is\r\nvery sick." I asked what was the matter, and she said, "Much (many)\r\nteeth do make Nancy sick." (Mildred is teething.)\r\n\r\nI happened to tell her the other day that the vine on the fence was a\r\n"creeper." She was greatly amused, and began at once to find analogies\r\nbetween her movements and those of the plants. They run, creep, hop, and\r\nskip, bend, fall, climb, and swing; but she tells me roguishly that she\r\nis "walk-plant."\r\n\r\nHelen held some worsted for me last night while I wound it. Afterward\r\nshe began to swing round and round, spelling to herself all the time,\r\n"Wind fast, wind slow," and apparently enjoying her conceit very much.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 15, 1887.\r\n\r\nWe had a glorious thunder-tempest last night, and it\'s much cooler\r\nto-day. We all feel refreshed, as if we\'d had a shower-bath. Helen\'s as\r\nlively as a cricket. She wanted to know if men were shooting in the sky\r\nwhen she felt the thunder, and if the trees and flowers drank all the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 19, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy little pupil continues to manifest the same eagerness to learn as at\r\nfirst. Her every waking moment is spent in the endeavour to satisfy her\r\ninnate desire for knowledge, and her mind works so incessantly that we\r\nhave feared for her health. But her appetite, which left her a few weeks\r\nago, has returned, and her sleep seems more quiet and natural. She will\r\nbe seven years old the twenty-seventh of this month. Her height is\r\nfour feet one inch, and her head measures twenty and one-half inches in\r\ncircumference, the line being drawn round the head so as to pass over\r\nthe prominences of the parietal and frontal bones. Above this line the\r\nhead rises one and one-fourth inches.\r\n\r\nDuring our walks she keeps up a continual spelling, and delights to\r\naccompany it with actions such as skipping, hopping, jumping, running,\r\nwalking fast, walking slow, and the like. When she drops stitches she\r\nsays, "Helen wrong, teacher will cry." If she wants water she says,\r\n"Give Helen drink water." She knows four hundred words besides numerous\r\nproper nouns. In one lesson I taught her these words: BEDSTEAD,\r\nMATTRESS, SHEET, BLANKET, COMFORTER, SPREAD, PILLOW. The next day I\r\nfound that she remembered all but spread. The same day she had learned,\r\nat different times, the words: hOUSE, WEED, DUST, SWING, MOLASSES, FAST,\r\nSLOW, MAPLE-SUGAR and COUNTER, and she had not forgotten one of these\r\nlast. This will give you an idea of the retentive memory she possesses.\r\nShe can count to thirty very quickly, and can write seven of the\r\nsquare-hand letters and the words which can be made with them. She seems\r\nto understand about writing letters, and is impatient to "write Frank\r\nletter." She enjoys punching holes in paper with the stiletto, and I\r\nsupposed it was because she could examine the result of her work; but we\r\nwatched her one day, and I was much surprised to find that she imagined\r\nshe was writing a letter. She would spell "Eva" (a cousin of whom she\r\nis very fond) with one hand, then make believe to write it; then spell,\r\n"sick in bed," and write that. She kept this up for nearly an hour.\r\nShe was (or imagined she was) putting on paper the things which had\r\ninterested her. When she had finished the letter she carried it to her\r\nmother and spelled, "Frank letter," and gave it to her brother to\r\ntake to the post-office. She had been with me to take letters to the\r\npost-office.\r\n\r\nShe recognizes instantly a person whom she has once met, and spells the\r\nname. Unlike Laura Bridgman, she is fond of gentlemen, and we notice\r\nthat she makes friends with a gentleman sooner than with a lady.\r\n\r\nShe is always ready to share whatever she has with those about her,\r\noften keeping but very little for herself. She is very fond of dress\r\nand of all kinds of finery, and is very unhappy when she finds a hole in\r\nanything she is wearing. She will insist on having her hair put in curl\r\npapers when she is so sleepy she can scarcely stand. She discovered a\r\nhole in her boot the other morning, and, after breakfast, she went to\r\nher father and spelled, "Helen new boot Simpson (her brother) buggy\r\nstore man." One can easily see her meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 3, 1887.\r\n\r\nThere was a great rumpus downstairs this morning. I heard Helen\r\nscreaming, and ran down to see what was the matter. I found her in a\r\nterrible passion. I had hoped this would never happen again. She has\r\nbeen so gentle and obedient the past two months, I thought love had\r\nsubdued the lion; but it seems he was only sleeping. At all events,\r\nthere she was, tearing and scratching and biting Viney like some wild\r\nthing. It seems Viney had attempted to take a glass, which Helen was\r\nfilling with stones, fearing that she would break it. Helen resisted,\r\nand Viney tried to force it out of her hand, and I suspect that she\r\nslapped the child, or did something which caused this unusual outburst\r\nof temper. When I took her hand she was trembling violently, and began\r\nto cry. I asked what was the matter, and she spelled: "Viney--bad,"\r\nand began to slap and kick her with renewed violence. I held her hands\r\nfirmly until she became more calm.\r\n\r\nLater Helen came to my room, looking very sad, and wanted to kiss me. I\r\nsaid, "I cannot kiss naughty girl." She spelled, "Helen is good, Viney\r\nis bad." I said: "You struck Viney and kicked her and hurt her. You were\r\nvery naughty, and I cannot kiss naughty girl." She stood very still\r\nfor a moment, and it was evident from her face, which was flushed and\r\ntroubled, that a struggle was going on in her mind. Then she said:\r\n"Helen did (does) not love teacher. Helen do love mother. Mother will\r\nwhip Viney." I told her that she had better not talk about it any more,\r\nbut think. She knew that I was much troubled, and would have liked to\r\nstay near me; but I thought it best for her to sit by herself. At\r\nthe dinner-table she was greatly disturbed because I didn\'t eat, and\r\nsuggested that "Cook make tea for teacher." But I told her that my heart\r\nwas sad, and I didn\'t feel like eating. She began to cry and sob and\r\nclung to me.\r\n\r\nShe was very much excited when we went upstairs; so I tried to interest\r\nher in a curious insect called a stick-bug. It\'s the queerest thing I\r\never saw--a little bundle of fagots fastened together in the middle. I\r\nwouldn\'t believe it was alive until I saw it move. Even then it looked\r\nmore like a mechanical toy than a living creature. But the poor little\r\ngirl couldn\'t fix her attention. Her heart was full of trouble, and she\r\nwanted to talk about it. She said: "Can bug know about naughty girl? Is\r\nbug very happy?" Then, putting her arms round my neck, she said: "I am\r\n(will be) good to-morrow. Helen is (will be) good all days." I said,\r\n"Will you tell Viney you are very sorry you scratched and kicked her?"\r\nShe smiled and answered, "Viney (can) not spell words." "I will tell\r\nViney you are very sorry," I said. "Will you go with me and find Viney?"\r\nShe was very willing to go, and let Viney kiss her, though she didn\'t\r\nreturn the caress. She has been unusually affectionate since, and it\r\nseems to me there is a sweetness-a soul-beauty in her face which I have\r\nnot seen before.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 31, 1887.\r\n\r\nHelen\'s pencil-writing is excellent, as you will see from the enclosed\r\nletter, which she wrote for her own amusement. I am teaching her the\r\nbraille alphabet, and she is delighted to be able to make words herself\r\nthat she can feel.\r\n\r\nShe has now reached the question stage of her development. It is "what?"\r\n"why?" "when?" especially "why?" all day long, and as her intelligence\r\ngrows her inquiries become more insistent. I remember how unbearable I\r\nused to find the inquisitiveness of my friends\' children; but I know now\r\nthat these questions indicate the child\'s growing interest in the cause\r\nof things. The "why?" is the DOOR THROUGH WHICH HE ENTERS THE WORLD OF\r\nREASON AND REFLECTION. "How does carpenter know to build house?" "Who\r\nput chickens in eggs?" "Why is Viney black?" "Flies bite--why?" "Can\r\nflies know not to bite?" "Why did father kill sheep?" Of course she asks\r\nmany questions that are not as intelligent as these. Her mind isn\'t more\r\nlogical than the minds of ordinary children. On the whole, her questions\r\nare analogous to those that a bright three-year-old child asks; but her\r\ndesire for knowledge is so earnest, the questions are never tedious,\r\nthough they draw heavily upon my meager store of information, and tax my\r\ningenuity to the utmost.\r\n\r\nI had a letter from Laura Bridgman last Sunday. Please give her my\r\nlove, and tell her Helen sends her a kiss. I read the letter at the\r\nsupper-table, and Mrs. Keller exclaimed: "My, Miss Annie, Helen writes\r\nalmost as well as that now!" It is true.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 21, 1887.\r\n\r\nWe had a beautiful time in Huntsville. Everybody there was delighted\r\nwith Helen, and showered her with gifts and kisses. The first evening\r\nshe learned the names of all the people in the hotel, about twenty, I\r\nthink. The next morning we were astonished to find that she remembered\r\nall of them, and recognized every one she had met the night before. She\r\ntaught the young people the alphabet, and several of them learned to\r\ntalk with her. One of the girls taught her to dance the polka, and a\r\nlittle boy showed her his rabbits and spelled their names for her. She\r\nwas delighted, and showed her pleasure by hugging and kissing the little\r\nfellow, which embarrassed him very much.\r\n\r\nWe had Helen\'s picture taken with a fuzzy, red-eyed little poodle, who\r\ngot himself into my lady\'s good graces by tricks and cunning devices\r\nknown only to dogs with an instinct for getting what they want.\r\n\r\nShe has talked incessantly since her return about what she did in\r\nHuntsville, and we notice a very decided improvement in her ability\r\nto use language. Curiously enough, a drive we took to the top of Monte\r\nSano, a beautiful mountain not far from Huntsville, seems to have\r\nimpressed her more than anything else, except the wonderful poodle.\r\nShe remembers all that I told her about it, and in telling her mother\r\nREPEATED THE VERY WORDS AND PHRASES I HAD USED IN DESCRIBING IT TO HER.\r\nIn conclusion she asked her mother if she should like to see "very high\r\nmountain and beautiful cloudcaps." I hadn\'t used this expression. I\r\nsaid, "The clouds touch the mountain softly, like beautiful flowers."\r\nYou see, I had to use words and images with which she was familiar\r\nthrough the sense of touch. But it hardly seems possible that any mere\r\nwords should convey to one who has never seen a mountain the faintest\r\nidea of its grandeur; and I don\'t see how any one is ever to know what\r\nimpression she did receive, or the cause of her pleasure in what was\r\ntold her about it. All that we do know certainly is that she has a good\r\nmemory and imagination and the faculty of association.\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 28, 1887.\r\n\r\nI do wish things would stop being born! "New puppies," "new calves" and\r\n"new babies" keep Helen\'s interest in the why and wherefore of things at\r\nwhite heat. The arrival of a new baby at Ivy Green the other day was the\r\noccasion of a fresh outburst of questions about the origin of babies and\r\nlive things in general. "Where did Leila get new baby? How did doctor\r\nknow where to find baby? Did Leila tell doctor to get very small new\r\nbaby? Where did doctor find Guy and Prince?" (puppies) "Why is Elizabeth\r\nEvelyn\'s sister?" etc., etc. These questions were sometimes asked under\r\ncircumstances which rendered them embarrassing, and I made up my mind\r\nthat something must be done. If it was natural for Helen to ask such\r\nquestions, it was my duty to answer them. It\'s a great mistake, I think,\r\nto put children off with falsehoods and nonsense, when their growing\r\npowers of observation and discrimination excite in them a desire to know\r\nabout things. From the beginning, I HAVE MADE IT A PRACTICE TO ANSWER\r\nALL HELEN\'S QUESTIONS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY IN A WAY INTELLIGIBLE\r\nTO HER, and at the same time truthfully. "Why should I treat these\r\nquestions differently?" I asked myself. I decided that there was no\r\nreason, except my deplorable ignorance of the great facts that underlie\r\nour physical existence. It was no doubt because of this ignorance that\r\nI rushed in where more experienced angels fear to tread. There isn\'t\r\na living soul in this part of the world to whom I can go for advice in\r\nthis, or indeed, in any other educational difficulty. The only thing for\r\nme to do in a perplexity is to go ahead, and learn by making mistakes.\r\nBut in this case I don\'t think I made a mistake. I took Helen and my\r\nBotany, "How Plants Grow," up in the tree, where we often go to read and\r\nstudy, and I told her in simple words the story of plantlife. I reminded\r\nher of the corn, beans and watermelon-seed she had planted in the\r\nspring, and told her that the tall corn in the garden, and the beans and\r\nwatermelon vines had grown from those seeds. I explained how the earth\r\nkeeps the seeds warm and moist, until the little leaves are strong\r\nenough to push themselves out into the light and air where they can\r\nbreathe and grow and bloom and make more seeds, from which other\r\nbaby-plants shall grow. I drew an analogy between plant and animal-life,\r\nand told her that seeds are eggs as truly as hens\' eggs and birds\'\r\neggs--that the mother hen keeps her eggs warm and dry until the little\r\nchicks come out. I made her understand that all life comes from an egg.\r\nThe mother bird lays her eggs in a nest and keeps them warm until the\r\nbirdlings are hatched. The mother fish lays her eggs where she knows\r\nthey will be moist and safe, until it is time for the little fish to\r\ncome out. I told her that she could call the egg the cradle of life.\r\nThen I told her that other animals like the dog and cow, and human\r\nbeings, do not lay their eggs, but nourish their young in their own\r\nbodies. I had no difficulty in making it clear to her that if plants and\r\nanimals didn\'t produce offspring after their kind, they would cease to\r\nexist, and everything in the world would soon die. But the function of\r\nsex I passed over as lightly as possible. I did, however, try to give\r\nher the idea that love is the great continuer of life. The subject was\r\ndifficult, and my knowledge inadequate; but I am glad I didn\'t shirk\r\nmy responsibility; for, stumbling, hesitating, and incomplete as my\r\nexplanation was, it touched deep responsive chords in the soul of my\r\nlittle pupil, and the readiness with which she comprehended the great\r\nfacts of physical life confirmed me in the opinion that the child has\r\ndormant within him, when he comes into the world, all the experiences\r\nof the race. These experiences are like photographic negatives, until\r\nlanguage develops them and brings out the memory-images.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 4, 1887.\r\n\r\nHelen had a letter this morning from her uncle, Doctor Keller. He\r\ninvited her to come to see him at Hot Springs. The name Hot Springs\r\ninterested her, and she asked many questions about it. She knows about\r\ncold springs. There are several near Tuscumbia; one very large one\r\nfrom which the town got its name. "Tuscumbia" is the Indian for "Great\r\nSpring." But she was surprised that hot water should come out of the\r\nground. She wanted to know who made fire under the ground, and if it was\r\nlike the fire in stoves, and if it burned the roots of plants and trees.\r\n\r\nShe was much pleased with the letter, and after she had asked all the\r\nquestions she could think of, she took it to her mother, who was sewing\r\nin the hall, and read it to her. It was amusing to see her hold it\r\nbefore her eyes and spell the sentences out on her fingers, just as I\r\nhad done. Afterward she tried to read it to Belle (the dog) and Mildred.\r\nMrs. Keller and I watched the nursery comedy from the door. Belle was\r\nsleepy, and Mildred inattentive. Helen looked very serious, and, once\r\nor twice, when Mildred tried to take the letter, she put her hand away\r\nimpatiently. Finally Belle got up, shook herself, and was about to\r\nwalk away, when Helen caught her by the neck and forced her to lie down\r\nagain. In the meantime Mildred had got the letter and crept away with\r\nit. Helen felt on the floor for it, but not finding it there, she\r\nevidently suspected Mildred; for she made the little sound which is her\r\n"baby call." Then she got up and stood very still, as if listening with\r\nher feet for Mildred\'s "thump, thump." When she had located the sound,\r\nshe went quickly toward the little culprit and found her chewing the\r\nprecious letter! This was too much for Helen. She snatched the letter\r\nand slapped the little hands soundly. Mrs. Keller took the baby in her\r\narms, and when we had succeeded in pacifying her, I asked Helen, "What\r\ndid you do to baby?" She looked troubled, and hesitated a moment before\r\nanswering. Then she said: "Wrong girl did eat letter. Helen did slap\r\nvery wrong girl." I told her that Mildred was very small, and didn\'t\r\nknow that it was wrong to put the letter in her mouth.\r\n\r\n"I did tell baby, no, no, much (many) times," was Helen\'s reply.\r\n\r\nI said, "Mildred doesn\'t understand your fingers, and we must be very\r\ngentle with her."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n"Baby--not think. Helen will give baby pretty letter," and with that she\r\nran upstairs and brought down a neatly folded sheet of braille, on which\r\nshe had written some words, and gave it to Mildred, saying, "Baby can\r\neat all words."\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 18, 1887.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder you were surprised to hear that I was going to write\r\nsomething for the report. I do not know myself how it happened, except\r\nthat I got tired of saying "no," and Captain Keller urged me to do\r\nit. He agreed with Mr. Anagnos that it was my duty to give others\r\nthe benefit of my experience. Besides, they said Helen\'s wonderful\r\ndeliverance might be a boon to other afflicted children.\r\n\r\nWhen I sit down to write, my thoughts freeze, and when I get them on\r\npaper they look like wooden soldiers all in a row, and if a live one\r\nhappens along, I put him in a strait-jacket. It\'s easy enough, however,\r\nto say Helen is wonderful, because she really is. I kept a record of\r\neverything she said last week, and I found that she knows six hundred\r\nwords. This does not mean, however, that she always uses them correctly.\r\nSometimes her sentences are like Chinese puzzles; but they are the kind\r\nof puzzles children make when they try to express their half-formed\r\nideas by means of arbitrary language. She has the true language-impulse,\r\nand shows great fertility of resource in making the words at her command\r\nconvey her meaning.\r\n\r\nLately she has been much interested in colour. She found the word\r\n"brown" in her primer and wanted to know its meaning. I told her that\r\nher hair was brown, and she asked, "Is brown very pretty?" After we had\r\nbeen all over the house, and I had told her the colour of everything\r\nshe touched, she suggested that we go to the hen-houses and barns; but\r\nI told her she must wait until another day because I was very tired. We\r\nsat in the hammock; but there was no rest for the weary there. Helen\r\nwas eager to know "more colour." I wonder if she has any vague idea of\r\ncolour--any reminiscent impression of light and sound. It seems as if a\r\nchild who could see and hear until her nineteenth month must retain some\r\nof her first impressions, though ever so faintly. Helen talks a great\r\ndeal about things that she cannot know of through the sense of touch.\r\nShe asks many questions about the sky, day and night, the ocean and\r\nmountains. She likes to have me tell her what I see in pictures.\r\n\r\nBut I seem to have lost the thread of my discourse. "What colour is\r\nthink?" was one of the restful questions she asked, as we swung to and\r\nfro in the hammock. I told her that when we are happy our thoughts are\r\nbright, and when we are naughty they are sad. Quick as a flash she said,\r\n"My think is white, Viney\'s think is black." You see, she had an idea\r\nthat the colour of our thoughts matched that of our skin. I couldn\'t\r\nhelp laughing, for at that very moment Viney was shouting at the top of\r\nher voice:\r\n\r\n"I long to sit on dem jasper walls And see dem sinners stumble and\r\nfall!"\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 3, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy account for the report is finished and sent off. I have two copies,\r\nand will send you one; but you mustn\'t show it to anybody. It\'s Mr.\r\nAnagnos\'s property until it is published.\r\n\r\nI suppose the little girls enjoyed Helen\'s letter. She wrote it out of\r\nher own head, as the children say.\r\n\r\nShe talks a great deal about what she will do when she goes to Boston.\r\nShe asked the other day, "Who made all things and Boston?" She says\r\nMildred will not go there because "Baby does cry all days."\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 25, 1887.\r\n\r\nHelen wrote another letter to the little girls yesterday, and her father\r\nsent it to Mr. Anagnos. Ask him to let you see it. She has begun to use\r\nthe pronouns of her own accord. This morning I happened to say, "Helen\r\nwill go upstairs." She laughed and said, "Teacher is wrong. You will\r\ngo upstairs." This is another great forward step. Thus it always is.\r\nYesterday\'s perplexities are strangely simple to-day, and to-day\'s\r\ndifficulties become to-morrow\'s pastime.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of Helen\'s mind is beautiful to watch. I doubt if\r\nany teacher ever had a work of such absorbing interest. There must have\r\nbeen one lucky star in the heavens at my birth, and I am just beginning\r\nto feel its beneficent influence.\r\n\r\nI had two letters from Mr. Anagnos last week. He is more grateful for my\r\nreport than the English idiom will express. Now he wants a picture "of\r\ndarling Helen and her illustrious teacher, to grace the pages of the\r\nforthcoming annual report."\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober, 1887.\r\n\r\nYou have probably read, ere this, Helen\'s second letter to the little\r\ngirls. I am aware that the progress which she has made between the\r\nwriting of the two letters must seem incredible. Only those who are with\r\nher daily can realize the rapid advancement which she is making in the\r\nacquisition of language. You will see from her letter that she uses many\r\npronouns correctly. She rarely misuses or omits one in conversation. Her\r\npassion for writing letters and putting her thoughts upon paper grows\r\nmore intense. She now tells stories in which the imagination plays an\r\nimportant part. She is also beginning to realize that she is not like\r\nother children. The other day she asked, "What do my eyes do?" I told\r\nher that I could see things with my eyes, and that she could see them\r\nwith her fingers. After thinking a moment she said, "My eyes are bad!"\r\nthen she changed it into "My eyes are sick!"\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Sullivan\'s first report, which was published in the official report\r\nof the Perkins Institution for the year 1887, is a short summary of what\r\nis fully recorded in the letters. Here follows the last part, beginning\r\nwith the great day, April 5th, when Helen learned water.\r\n\r\nIn her reports Miss Sullivan speaks of "lessons" as if they came in\r\nregular order. This is the effect of putting it all in a summary.\r\n"Lesson" is too formal for the continuous daily work.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day I took her to the cistern. As the water gushed from the pump I\r\nspelled "w-a-t-e-r." Instantly she tapped my hand for a repetition, and\r\nthen made the word herself with a radiant face. Just then the nurse came\r\ninto the cistern-house bringing her little sister. I put Helen\'s hand\r\non the baby and formed the letters "b-a-b-y," which she repeated without\r\nhelp and with the light of a new intelligence in her face.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the house everything she touched had to be named for\r\nher, and repetition was seldom necessary. Neither the length of the\r\nword nor the combination of letters seems to make any difference to the\r\nchild. Indeed, she remembers HELIOTROPE and CHRYSANTHEMUM more readily\r\nthan she does shorter names. At the end of August she knew 625 words.\r\n\r\nThis lesson was followed by one on words indicative of place-relations.\r\nHer dress was put IN a trunk, and then ON it, and these prepositions\r\nwere spelled for her. Very soon she learned the difference between ON\r\nand IN, though it was some time before she could use these words in\r\nsentences of her own. Whenever it was possible she was made the actor in\r\nthe lesson, and was delighted to stand ON the chair, and to be put INTO\r\nthe wardrobe. In connection with this lesson she learned the names\r\nof the members of the family and the word IS. "Helen is in wardrobe,"\r\n"Mildred is in crib," "Box is on table," "Papa is on bed," are specimens\r\nof sentences constructed by her during the latter part of April.\r\n\r\nNext came a lesson on words expressive of positive quality. For the\r\nfirst lesson I had two balls, one made of worsted, large and soft, the\r\nother a bullet. She perceived the difference in size at once. Taking\r\nthe bullet she made her habitual sign for SMALL--that is, by pinching\r\na little bit of the skin of one hand. Then she took the other ball and\r\nmade her sign for LARGE by spreading both hands over it. I substituted\r\nthe adjectives LARGE and SMALL for those signs. Then her attention was\r\ncalled to the hardness of the one ball and the softness of the other,\r\nand she learned SOFT and HARD. A few minutes afterward she felt of her\r\nlittle sister\'s head and said to her mother, "Mildred\'s head is small\r\nand hard." Next I tried to teach her the meaning of FAST and SLOW. She\r\nhelped me wind some worsted one day, first rapidly and afterward slowly.\r\nI then said to her with the finger alphabet, "wind fast," or "wind\r\nslow," holding her hands and showing her how to do as I wished. The next\r\nday, while exercising, she spelled to me, "Helen wind fast," and began\r\nto walk rapidly. Then she said, "Helen wind slow," again suiting the\r\naction to the words.\r\n\r\nI now thought it time to teach her to read printed words. A slip on\r\nwhich was printed, in raised letters, the word BOX was placed on the\r\nobject, and the same experiment was tried with a great many articles,\r\nbut she did not immediately comprehend that the label-name represented\r\nthe thing. Then I took an alphabet sheet and put her finger on the\r\nletter A, at the same time making A with my fingers. She moved her\r\nfinger from one printed character to another as I formed each letter on\r\nmy fingers. She learned all the letters, both capital and small, in one\r\nday. Next I turned to the first page of the primer and made her touch\r\nthe word CAT, spelling it on my fingers at the same time. Instantly she\r\ncaught the idea, and asked me to find DOG and many other words. Indeed,\r\nshe was much displeased because I could not find her name in the\r\nbook. Just then I had no sentences in raised letters which she could\r\nunderstand; but she would sit for hours feeling each word in her book.\r\nWhen she touched one with which she was familiar, a peculiarly sweet\r\nexpression lighted her face, and we saw her countenance growing sweeter\r\nand more earnest every day. About this time I sent a list of the words\r\nshe knew to Mr. Anagnos, and he very kindly had them printed for her.\r\nHer mother and I cut up several sheets of printed words so that she\r\ncould arrange them into sentences. This delighted her more than anything\r\nshe had yet done; and the practice thus obtained prepared the way for\r\nthe writing lessons. There was no difficulty in making her understand\r\nhow to write the same sentences with pencil and paper which she made\r\nevery day with the slips, and she very soon perceived that she need not\r\nconfine herself to phrases already learned, but could communicate any\r\nthought that was passing through her mind. I put one of the writing\r\nboards used by the blind between the folds of the paper on the table,\r\nand allowed her to examine an alphabet of the square letters, such as\r\nshe was to make. I then guided her hand to form the sentence, "Cat does\r\ndrink milk." When she finished it she was overjoyed. She carried it to\r\nher mother, who spelled it to her.\r\n\r\nDay after day she moved her pencil in the same tracks along the grooved\r\npaper, never for a moment expressing the least impatience or sense of\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nAs she had now learned to express her ideas on paper, I next taught her\r\nthe braille system. She learned it gladly when she discovered that she\r\ncould herself read what she had written; and this still affords her\r\nconstant pleasure. For a whole evening she will sit at the table writing\r\nwhatever comes into her busy brain; and I seldom find any difficulty in\r\nreading what she has written.\r\n\r\nHer progress in arithmetic has been equally remarkable. She can add and\r\nsubtract with great rapidity up to the sum of one hundred; and she knows\r\nthe multiplication tables as far as the FIVES. She was working recently\r\nwith the number forty, when I said to her, "Make twos." She replied\r\nimmediately, "Twenty twos make forty." Later I said, "Make fifteen\r\nthrees and count." I wished her to make the groups of threes and\r\nsupposed she would then have to count them in order to know what\r\nnumber fifteen threes would make. But instantly she spelled the answer:\r\n"Fifteen threes make forty-five."\r\n\r\nOn being told that she was white and that one of the servants was black,\r\nshe concluded that all who occupied a similar menial position were of\r\nthe same hue; and whenever I asked her the colour of a servant she would\r\nsay "black." When asked the colour of some one whose occupation she did\r\nnot know she seemed bewildered, and finally said "blue."\r\n\r\nShe has never been told anything about death or the burial of the body,\r\nand yet on entering the cemetery for the first time in her life, with\r\nher mother and me, to look at some flowers, she laid her hand on our\r\neyes and repeatedly spelled "cry--cry." Her eyes actually filled with\r\ntears. The flowers did not seem to give her pleasure, and she was very\r\nquiet while we stayed there.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion while walking with me she seemed conscious of the\r\npresence of her brother, although we were distant from him. She spelled\r\nhis name repeatedly and started in the direction in which he was coming.\r\n\r\nWhen walking or riding she often gives the names of the people we meet\r\nalmost as soon as we recognize them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters take up the account again.\r\n\r\nNovember 13, 1887.\r\n\r\nWe took Helen to the circus, and had "the time of our lives"! The circus\r\npeople were much interested in Helen, and did everything they could to\r\nmake her first circus a memorable event. They let her feel the animals\r\nwhenever it was safe. She fed the elephants, and was allowed to climb\r\nup on the back of the largest, and sit in the lap of the "Oriental\r\nPrincess," while the elephant marched majestically around the ring. She\r\nfelt some young lions. They were as gentle as kittens; but I told her\r\nthey would get wild and fierce as they grew older. She said to the\r\nkeeper, "I will take the baby lions home and teach them to be mild." The\r\nkeeper of the bears made one big black fellow stand on his hind legs\r\nand hold out his great paw to us, which Helen shook politely. She\r\nwas greatly delighted with the monkeys and kept her hand on the star\r\nperformer while he went through his tricks, and laughed heartily when\r\nhe took off his hat to the audience. One cute little fellow stole her\r\nhair-ribbon, and another tried to snatch the flowers out of her hat. I\r\ndon\'t know who had the best time, the monkeys, Helen or the spectators.\r\nOne of the leopards licked her hands, and the man in charge of the\r\ngiraffes lifted her up in his arms so that she could feel their ears\r\nand see how tall they were. She also felt a Greek chariot, and the\r\ncharioteer would have liked to take her round the ring; but she was\r\nafraid of "many swift horses." The riders and clowns and rope-walkers\r\nwere all glad to let the little blind girl feel their costumes and\r\nfollow their motions whenever it was possible, and she kissed them all,\r\nto show her gratitude. Some of them cried, and the wild man of Borneo\r\nshrank from her sweet little face in terror. She has talked about\r\nnothing but the circus ever since. In order to answer her questions, I\r\nhave been obliged to read a great deal about animals. At present I feel\r\nlike a jungle on wheels!\r\n\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1887.\r\n\r\nI find it hard to realize that Christmas is almost here, in spite of the\r\nfact that Helen talks about nothing else. Do you remember what a happy\r\ntime we had last Christmas?\r\n\r\nHelen has learned to tell the time at last, and her father is going to\r\ngive her a watch for Christmas.\r\n\r\nHelen is as eager to have stories told her as any hearing child I ever\r\nknew. She has made me repeat the story of little Red Riding Hood so\r\noften that I believe I could say it backward. She likes stories that\r\nmake her cry--I think we all do, it\'s so nice to feel sad when you\'ve\r\nnothing particular to be sad about. I am teaching her little rhymes and\r\nverses, too. They fix beautiful thoughts in her memory. I think, too,\r\nthat they quicken all the child\'s faculties, because they stimulate\r\nthe imagination. Of course I don\'t try to explain everything. If I\r\ndid, there would be no opportunity for the play of fancy. TOO MUCH\r\nEXPLANATION DIRECTS THE CHILD\'S ATTENTION TO WORDS AND SENTENCES, SO\r\nTHAT HE FAILS TO GET THE THOUGHT AS A WHOLE. I do not think anyone can\r\nread, or talk for that matter, until he forgets words and sentences in\r\nthe technical sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1888.\r\n\r\nIt is a great thing to feel that you are of some use in the world,\r\nthat you are necessary to somebody. Helen\'s dependence on me for almost\r\neverything makes me strong and glad.\r\n\r\nChristmas week was a very busy one here, too. Helen is invited to all\r\nthe children\'s entertainments, and I take her to as many as I can.\r\nI want her to know children and to be with them as much as possible.\r\nSeveral little girls have learned to spell on their fingers and are very\r\nproud of the accomplishment. One little chap, about seven, was persuaded\r\nto learn the letters, and he spelled his name for Helen. She was\r\ndelighted, and showed her joy, by hugging and kissing him, much to his\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nSaturday the school-children had their tree, and I took Helen. It was\r\nthe first Christmas tree she had ever seen, and she was puzzled, and\r\nasked many questions. "Who made tree grow in house? Why? Who put many\r\nthings on tree?" She objected to its miscellaneous fruits and began to\r\nremove them, evidently thinking they were all meant for her. It was not\r\ndifficult, however, to make her understand that there was a present for\r\neach child, and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts\r\nto the children. There were several presents for herself. She placed\r\nthem in a chair, resisting all temptation to look at them until every\r\nchild had received his gifts. One little girl had fewer presents than\r\nthe rest, and Helen insisted on sharing her gifts with her. It was very\r\nsweet to see the children\'s eager interest in Helen, and their readiness\r\nto give her pleasure. The exercises began at nine, and it was one\r\no\'clock before we could leave. My fingers and head ached; but Helen was\r\nas fresh and full of spirit as when we left home.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner it began to snow, and we had a good frolic and an\r\ninteresting lesson about the snow. Sunday morning the ground was\r\ncovered, and Helen and the cook\'s children and I played snowball. By\r\nnoon the snow was all gone. It was the first snow I had seen here, and\r\nit made me a little homesick. The Christmas season has furnished many\r\nlessons, and added scores of new words to Helen\'s vocabulary.\r\n\r\nFor weeks we did nothing but talk and read and tell each other stories\r\nabout Christmas. Of course I do not try to explain all the new words,\r\nnor does Helen fully understand the little stories I tell her; but\r\nconstant repetition fixes the words and phrases in the mind, and little\r\nby little the meaning will come to her. I SEE NO SENSE IN "FAKING"\r\nCONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF TEACHING LANGUAGE. IT\'S STUPID AND\r\nDEADENING TO PUPIL AND TEACHER. TALK SHOULD BE NATURAL AND HAVE FOR ITS\r\nOBJECT AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS. If there is nothing in the child\'s mind to\r\ncommunicate, it hardly seems worth while to require him to write on the\r\nblackboard, or spell on his fingers, cut and dried sentences about\r\n"the cat," "the bird," "a dog." I HAVE TRIED FROM THE BEGINNING TO TALK\r\nNATURALLY TO HELEN AND TO TEACH HER TO TELL ME ONLY THINGS THAT INTEREST\r\nHER AND ASK QUESTIONS ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF FINDING OUT WHAT SHE WANTS TO\r\nKNOW. When I see that she is eager to tell me something, but is hampered\r\nbecause she does not know the words, I supply them and the necessary\r\nidioms, and we get along finely. The child\'s eagerness and interest\r\ncarry her over many obstacles that would be our undoing if we stopped to\r\ndefine and explain everything. What would happen, do you think, if some\r\none should try to measure our intelligence by our ability to define\r\nthe commonest words we use? I fear me, if I were put to such a test,\r\nI should be consigned to the primary class in a school for the\r\nfeeble-minded.\r\n\r\nIt was touching and beautiful to see Helen enjoy her first Christmas.\r\nOf course, she hung her stocking--two of them lest Santa Claus should\r\nforget one, and she lay awake for a long time and got up two or three\r\ntimes to see if anything had happened. When I told her that Santa Claus\r\nwould not come until she was asleep, she shut her eyes and said,\r\n"He will think girl is asleep." She was awake the first thing in the\r\nmorning, and ran to the fireplace for her stocking; and when she found\r\nthat Santa Claus had filled both stockings, she danced about for a\r\nminute, then grew very quiet, and came to ask me if I thought Santa\r\nClaus had made a mistake, and thought there were two little girls, and\r\nwould come back for the gifts when he discovered his mistake. The ring\r\nyou sent her was in the toe of the stocking, and when I told her you\r\ngave it to Santa Claus for her, she said, "I do love Mrs. Hopkins." She\r\nhad a trunk and clothes for Nancy, and her comment was, "Now Nancy will\r\ngo to party." When she saw the braille slate and paper, she said, "I\r\nwill write many letters, and I will thank Santa Claus very much." It was\r\nevident that every one, especially Captain and Mrs. Keller, was deeply\r\nmoved at the thought of the difference between this bright Christmas and\r\nthe last, when their little girl had no conscious part in the Christmas\r\nfestivities. As we came downstairs, Mrs. Keller said to me with tears in\r\nher eyes, "Miss Annie, I thank God every day of my life for sending you\r\nto us; but I never realized until this morning what a blessing you have\r\nbeen to us." Captain Keller took my hand, but could not speak. But\r\nhis silence was more eloquent than words. My heart, too, was full of\r\ngratitude and solemn joy.\r\n\r\nThe other day Helen came across the word grandfather in a little story\r\nand asked her mother, "Where is grandfather?" meaning her grandfather.\r\nMrs. Keller replied, "He is dead." "Did father shoot him?" Helen\r\nasked, and added, "I will eat grandfather for dinner." So far, her only\r\nknowledge of death is in connection with things to eat. She knows that\r\nher father shoots partridges and deer and other game.\r\n\r\nThis morning she asked me the meaning of "carpenter," and the question\r\nfurnished the text for the day\'s lesson. After talking about the various\r\nthings that carpenters make, she asked me, "Did carpenter make me?" and\r\nbefore I could answer, she spelled quickly, "No, no, photographer made\r\nme in Sheffield."\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest iron furnaces has been started in Sheffield, and\r\nwe went over the other evening to see them make a "run." Helen felt the\r\nheat and asked, "Did the sun fall?"\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 9, 1888.\r\n\r\nThe report came last night. I appreciate the kind things Mr. Anagnos has\r\nsaid about Helen and me; but his extravagant way of saying them rubs me\r\nthe wrong way. The simple facts would be so much more convincing! Why,\r\nfor instance, does he take the trouble to ascribe motives to me that I\r\nnever dreamed of? You know, and he knows, and I know, that my motive in\r\ncoming here was not in any sense philanthropic. How ridiculous it is to\r\nsay I had drunk so copiously of the noble spirit of Dr. Howe that I was\r\nfired with the desire to rescue from darkness and obscurity the little\r\nAlabamian! I came here simply because circumstances made it necessary\r\nfor me to earn my living, and I seized upon the first opportunity that\r\noffered itself, although I did not suspect nor did he, that I had any\r\nspecial fitness for the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 26, 1888.\r\n\r\nI suppose you got Helen\'s letter. The little rascal has taken it into\r\nher head not to write with a pencil. I wanted her to write to her Uncle\r\nFrank this morning, but she objected. She said: "Pencil is very tired in\r\nhead. I will write Uncle Frank braille letter." I said, "But Uncle Frank\r\ncannot read braille." "I will teach him," she said. I explained that\r\nUncle Frank was old, and couldn\'t learn braille easily. In a flash she\r\nanswered, "I think Uncle Frank is much (too) old to read very small\r\nletters." Finally I persuaded her to write a few lines; but she broke\r\nher pencil six times before she finished it. I said to her, "You are\r\na naughty girl." "No," she replied, "pencil is very weak." I think her\r\nobjection to pencil-writing is readily accounted for by the fact that\r\nshe has been asked to write so many specimens for friends and strangers.\r\nYou know how the children at the Institution detest it. It is irksome\r\nbecause the process is so slow, and they cannot read what they have\r\nwritten or correct their mistakes.\r\n\r\nHelen is more and more interested in colour. When I told her that\r\nMildred\'s eyes were blue, she asked, "Are they like wee skies?" A little\r\nwhile after I had told her that a carnation that had been given her was\r\nred, she puckered up her mouth and said, "Lips are like one pink."\r\nI told her they were tulips; but of course she didn\'t understand the\r\nword-play. I can\'t believe that the colour-impressions she received\r\nduring the year and a half she could see and hear are entirely lost.\r\nEverything we have seen and heard is in the mind somewhere. It may be\r\ntoo vague and confused to be recognizable, but it is there all the same,\r\nlike the landscape we lose in the deepening twilight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 10, 1888.\r\n\r\nWe got home last night. We had a splendid time in Memphis, but I didn\'t\r\nrest much. It was nothing but excitement from first to last--drives,\r\nluncheons, receptions, and all that they involve when you have an eager,\r\ntireless child like Helen on your hands. She talked incessantly. I don\'t\r\nknow what I should have done, had some of the young people not learned\r\nto talk with her. They relieved me as much as possible. But even then\r\nI can never have a quiet half hour to myself. It is always: "Oh, Miss\r\nSullivan, please come and tell us what Helen means," or "Miss Sullivan,\r\nwon\'t you please explain this to Helen? We can\'t make her understand."\r\nI believe half the white population of Memphis called on us. Helen was\r\npetted and caressed enough to spoil an angel; but I do not think it\r\nis possible to spoil her, she is too unconscious of herself, and too\r\nloving.\r\n\r\nThe stores in Memphis are very good, and I managed to spend all the\r\nmoney that I had with me. One day Helen said, "I must buy Nancy a very\r\npretty hat." I said, "Very well, we will go shopping this afternoon."\r\nShe had a silver dollar and a dime. When we reached the shop, I asked\r\nher how much she would pay for Nancy\'s hat. She answered promptly, "I\r\nwill pay ten cents." "What will you do with the dollar?" I asked. "I\r\nwill buy some good candy to take to Tuscumbia," was her reply.\r\n\r\nWe visited the Stock Exchange and a steamboat. Helen was greatly\r\ninterested in the boat, and insisted on being shown every inch of it\r\nfrom the engine to the flag on the flagstaff. I was gratified to read\r\nwhat the Nation had to say about Helen last week.\r\n\r\nCaptain Keller has had two interesting letters since the publication of\r\nthe "Report," one from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, and the other from Dr.\r\nEdward Everett Hale. Dr. Hale claims kinship with Helen, and seems very\r\nproud of his little cousin. Dr. Bell writes that Helen\'s progress is\r\nwithout a parallel in the education of the deaf, or something like that\r\nand he says many nice things about her teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 5, 1888.\r\n\r\nI did not have a chance to finish my letter yesterday. Miss Ev. came up\r\nto help me make a list of words Helen has learned. We have got as far\r\nas P, and there are 900 words to her credit. I had Helen begin a journal\r\nMarch 1st.[Most of this journal was lost. Fortunately, however, Helen\r\nKeller wrote so many letters and exercises that there is no lack of\r\nrecords of that sort.] I don\'t know how long she will keep it up. It\'s\r\nrather stupid business, I think. Just now she finds it great fun. She\r\nseems to like to tell all she knows. This is what Helen wrote Sunday:\r\n\r\n"I got up, washed my face and hands, combed my hair, picked three dew\r\nviolets for Teacher and ate my breakfast. After breakfast I played with\r\ndolls short. Nancy was cross. Cross is cry and kick. I read in my book\r\nabout large, fierce animals. Fierce is much cross and strong and very\r\nhungry. I do not love fierce animals. I wrote letter to Uncle James. He\r\nlives in Hotsprings. He is doctor. Doctor makes sick girl well. I do not\r\nlike sick. Then I ate my dinner. I like much icecream very much. After\r\ndinner father went to Birmingham on train far away. I had letter from\r\nRobert. He loves me. He said Dear Helen, Robert was glad to get a letter\r\nfrom dear, sweet little Helen. I will come to see you when the sun\r\nshines. Mrs. Newsum is Robert\'s wife. Robert is her husband. Robert and\r\nI will run and jump and hop and dance and swing and talk about birds and\r\nflowers and trees and grass and Jumbo and Pearl will go with us. Teacher\r\nwill say, We are silly. She is funny. Funny makes us laugh. Natalie is a\r\ngood girl and does not cry. Mildred does cry. She will be a nice girl in\r\nmany days and run and play with me. Mrs. Graves is making short dresses\r\nfor Natalie. Mr. Mayo went to Duckhill and brought home many sweet\r\nflowers. Mr. Mayo and Mr. Farris and Mr. Graves love me and Teacher.\r\nI am going to Memphis to see them soon, and they will hug and kiss\r\nme. Thornton goes to school and gets his face dirty. Boy must be very\r\ncareful. After supper I played romp with Teacher in bed. She buried me\r\nunder the pillows and then I grew very slow like tree out of ground.\r\nNow, I will go to bed. HELEN KELLER."\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 16, 1888.\r\n\r\nWe are just back from church. Captain Keller said at breakfast this\r\nmorning that he wished I would take Helen to church. The Presbytery\r\nwould be there in a body, and he wanted the ministers to see Helen. The\r\nSunday-school was in session when we arrived, and I wish you could have\r\nseen the sensation Helen\'s entrance caused. The children were so pleased\r\nto see her at Sunday-school, they paid no attention to their teachers,\r\nbut rushed out of their seats and surrounded us. She kissed them all,\r\nboys and girls, willing or unwilling. She seemed to think at first\r\nthat the children all belonged to the visiting ministers; but soon she\r\nrecognized some little friends among them, and I told her the ministers\r\ndidn\'t bring their children with them. She looked disappointed and said,\r\n"I\'ll send them many kisses." One of the ministers wished me to ask\r\nHelen, "What do ministers do?" She said, "They read and talk loud to\r\npeople to be good." He put her answer down in his note book. When it\r\nwas time for the church service to begin, she was in such a state of\r\nexcitement that I thought it best to take her away; but Captain Keller\r\nsaid, "No, she will be all right." So there was nothing to do but stay.\r\nIt was impossible to keep Helen quiet. She hugged and kissed me, and the\r\nquiet-looking divine who sat on the other side of her. He gave her his\r\nwatch to play with; but that didn\'t keep her still. She wanted to show\r\nit to the little boy in the seat behind us. When the communion service\r\nbegan, she smelt the wine, and sniffed so loud that every one in the\r\nchurch could hear. When the wine was passed to our neighbour, he was\r\nobliged to stand up to prevent her taking it away from him. I never was\r\nso glad to get out of a place as I was to leave that church! I tried\r\nto hurry Helen out-of-doors, but she kept her arm extended, and every\r\ncoat-tail she touched must needs turn round and give an account of the\r\nchildren he left at home, and receive kisses according to their number.\r\nEverybody laughed at her antics, and you would have thought they were\r\nleaving a place of amusement rather than a church. Captain Keller\r\ninvited some of the ministers to dinner. Helen was irrepressible. She\r\ndescribed in the most animated pantomime, supplemented by spelling, what\r\nshe was going to do in Brewster. Finally she got up from the table and\r\nwent through the motion of picking seaweed and shells, and splashing\r\nin the water, holding up her skirts higher than was proper under the\r\ncircumstances. Then she threw herself on the floor and began to swim\r\nso energetically that some of us thought we should be kicked out of our\r\nchairs! Her motions are often more expressive than any words, and she is\r\nas graceful as a nymph.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the days seem as interminable to you as they do to me. We\r\ntalk and plan and dream about nothing but Boston, Boston, Boston. I\r\nthink Mrs. Keller has definitely decided to go with us, but she will not\r\nstay all summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 15, 1888.\r\n\r\nDo you realize that this is the last letter I shall write to you for\r\na long, long time? The next word that you receive from me will be in a\r\nyellow envelope, and it will tell you when we shall reach Boston. I\r\nam too happy to write letters; but I must tell you about our visit to\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\nWe spent a delightful week with the "doctors." Dr. Keller met us in\r\nMemphis. Almost every one on the train was a physician, and Dr. Keller\r\nseemed to know them all. When we reached Cincinnati, we found the place\r\nfull of doctors. There were several prominent Boston physicians among\r\nthem. We stayed at the Burnet House. Everybody was delighted with Helen.\r\nAll the learned men marveled at her intelligence and gaiety. There\r\nis something about her that attracts people. I think it is her joyous\r\ninterest in everything and everybody.\r\n\r\nWherever she went she was the centre of interest. She was delighted\r\nwith the orchestra at the hotel, and whenever the music began she danced\r\nround the room, hugging and kissing every one she happened to touch. Her\r\nhappiness impressed all; nobody seemed to pity her. One gentleman said\r\nto Dr. Keller, "I have lived long and seen many happy faces; but I have\r\nnever seen such a radiant face as this child\'s before to-night." Another\r\nsaid, "Damn me! but I\'d give everything I own in the world to have\r\nthat little girl always near me." But I haven\'t time to write all the\r\npleasant things people said--they would make a very large book, and\r\nthe kind things they did for us would fill another volume. Dr. Keller\r\ndistributed the extracts from the report that Mr. Anagnos sent me, and\r\nhe could have disposed of a thousand if he had had them. Do you remember\r\nDr. Garcelon, who was Governor of Maine several years ago? He took us to\r\ndrive one afternoon, and wanted to give Helen a doll; but she said: "I\r\ndo not like too many children. Nancy is sick, and Adeline is cross, and\r\nIda is very bad." We laughed until we cried, she was so serious about\r\nit. "What would you like, then?" asked the Doctor. "Some beautiful\r\ngloves to talk with," she answered. The Doctor was puzzled. He had never\r\nheard of "talking-gloves"; but I explained that she had seen a glove\r\non which the alphabet was printed, and evidently thought they could be\r\nbought. I told him he could buy some gloves if he wished, and that I\r\nwould have the alphabet stamped on them.\r\n\r\nWe lunched with Mr. Thayer (your former pastor) and his wife. He asked\r\nme how I had taught Helen adjectives and the names of abstract ideas\r\nlike goodness and happiness. These same questions had been asked me\r\na hundred times by the learned doctors. It seems strange that people\r\nshould marvel at what is really so simple. Why, it is as easy to teach\r\nthe name of an idea, if it is clearly formulated in the child\'s mind, as\r\nto teach the name of an object. It would indeed be a herculean task to\r\nteach the words if the ideas did not already exist in the child\'s mind.\r\nIf his experiences and observations hadn\'t led him to the concepts,\r\nSMALL, LARGE, GOOD, BAD, SWEET, SOUR, he would have nothing to attach\r\nthe word-tags to.\r\n\r\nI, little ignorant I, found myself explaining to the wise men of the\r\nEast and the West such simple things as these: If you give a child\r\nsomething sweet, and he wags his tongue and smacks his lips and looks\r\npleased, he has a very definite sensation; and if, every time he has\r\nthis experience, he hears the word SWEET, or has it spelled into his\r\nhand, he will quickly adopt this arbitrary sign for his sensation.\r\nLikewise, if you put a bit of lemon on his tongue, he puckers up his\r\nlips and tries to spit it out; and after he has had this experience a\r\nfew times, if you offer him a lemon, he shuts his mouth and makes faces,\r\nclearly indicating that he remembers the unpleasant sensation. You label\r\nit SOUR, and he adopts your symbol. If you had called these sensations\r\nrespectively BLACK and WHITE, he would have adopted them as readily; but\r\nhe would mean by BLACK and WHITE the same things that he means by SWEET\r\nand SOUR. In the same way the child learns from many experiences to\r\ndifferentiate his feelings, and we name them for him--GOOD, BAD, GENTLE,\r\nROUGH, HAPPY, SAD. It is not the word, but the capacity to experience\r\nthe sensation that counts in his education.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis extract from one of Miss Sullivan\'s letters is added because it\r\ncontains interesting casual opinions stimulated by observing the methods\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe visited a little school for the deaf. We were very kindly received,\r\nand Helen enjoyed meeting the children. Two of the teachers knew the\r\nmanual alphabet, and talked to her without an interpreter. They were\r\nastonished at her command of language. Not a child in the school, they\r\nsaid, had anything like Helen\'s facility of expression, and some of them\r\nhad been under instruction for two or three years. I was incredulous\r\nat first; but after I had watched the children at work for a couple\r\nof hours, I knew that what I had been told was true, and I wasn\'t\r\nsurprised. In one room some little tots were standing before the\r\nblackboard, painfully constructing "simple sentences." A little girl\r\nhad written: "I have a new dress. It is a pretty dress. My mamma made my\r\npretty new dress. I love mamma." A curly-headed little boy was writing:\r\n"I have a large ball. I like to kick my large ball." When we entered the\r\nroom, the children\'s attention was riveted on Helen. One of them pulled\r\nme by the sleeve and said, "Girl is blind." The teacher was writing on\r\nthe blackboard: "The girl\'s name is Helen. She is deaf. She cannot see.\r\nWe are very sorry." I said: "Why do you write those sentences on the\r\nboard? Wouldn\'t the children understand if you talked to them\r\nabout Helen?" The teacher said something about getting the correct\r\nconstruction, and continued to construct an exercise out of Helen. I\r\nasked her if the little girl who had written about the new dress was\r\nparticularly pleased with her dress. "No," she replied, "I think not;\r\nbut children learn better if they write about things that concern them\r\npersonally." It seemed all so mechanical and difficult, my heart ached\r\nfor the poor little children. Nobody thinks of making a hearing child\r\nsay, "I have a pretty new dress," at the beginning. These children\r\nwere older in years, it is true, than the baby who lisps, "Papa kiss\r\nbaby--pretty," and fills out her meaning by pointing to her new dress;\r\nbut their ability to understand and use language was no greater.\r\n\r\nThere was the same difficulty throughout the school. In every classroom\r\nI saw sentences on the blackboard, which evidently had been written to\r\nillustrate some grammatical rule, or for the purpose of using words that\r\nhad previously been taught in the same, or in some other connection.\r\nThis sort of thing may be necessary in some stages of education; but it\r\nisn\'t the way to acquire language. NOTHING, I THINK, CRUSHES THE\r\nCHILD\'S IMPULSE TO TALK NATURALLY MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN THESE BLACKBOARD\r\nEXERCISES. The schoolroom is not the place to teach any young child\r\nlanguage, least of all the deaf child. He must be kept as unconscious as\r\nthe hearing child of the fact that he is learning words,AND HE SHOULD BE\r\nALLOWED TO PRATTLE ON HIS FINGERS, OR WITH HIS PENCIL, IN MONOSYLLABLES\r\nIF HE CHOOSES, UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HIS GROWING INTELLIGENCE DEMANDS THE\r\nSENTENCE. Language should not be associated in his mind with endless\r\nhours in school, with puzzling questions in grammar, or with anything\r\nthat is an enemy to joy. But I must not get into the habit of\r\ncriticizing other people\'s methods too severely. I may be as far from\r\nthe straight road as they.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Sullivan\'s second report brings the account down to October 1st,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past year Helen has enjoyed excellent health. Her eyes and\r\nears have been examined by specialists, and it is their opinion that she\r\ncannot have the slightest perception of either light or sound.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tell exactly to what extent the senses of smell and\r\ntaste aid her in gaining information respecting physical qualities; but,\r\naccording to eminent authority, these senses do exert a great influence\r\non the mental and moral development. Dugald Stewart says, "Some of the\r\nmost significant words relating to the human mind are borrowed from the\r\nsense of smell; and the conspicuous place which its sensations occupy in\r\nthe poetical language of all nations shows how easily and naturally they\r\nally themselves with the refined operations of the fancy and the moral\r\nemotions of the heart." Helen certainly derives great pleasure from\r\nthe exercise of these senses. On entering a greenhouse her countenance\r\nbecomes radiant, and she will tell the names of the flowers with which\r\nshe is familiar, by the sense of smell alone. Her recollections of the\r\nsensations of smell are very vivid. She enjoys in anticipation the\r\nscent of a rose or a violet; and if she is promised a bouquet of these\r\nflowers, a peculiarly happy expression lights her face, indicating that\r\nin imagination she perceives their fragrance, and that it is pleasant to\r\nher. It frequently happens that the perfume of a flower or the flavour\r\nof a fruit recalls to her mind some happy event in home life, or a\r\ndelightful birthday party.\r\n\r\nHer sense of touch has sensibly increased during the year, and has\r\ngained in acuteness and delicacy. Indeed, her whole body is so finely\r\norganized that she seems to use it as a medium for bringing herself\r\ninto closer relations with her fellow creatures. She is able not only to\r\ndistinguish with great accuracy the different undulations of the air and\r\nthe vibrations of the floor made by various sounds and motions, and to\r\nrecognize her friends and acquaintances the instant she touches their\r\nhands or clothing, but she also perceives the state of mind of those\r\naround her. It is impossible for any one with whom Helen is conversing\r\nto be particularly happy or sad, and withhold the knowledge of this fact\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\nShe observes the slightest emphasis placed upon a word in conversation,\r\nand she discovers meaning in every change of position, and in the varied\r\nplay of the muscles of the hand. She responds quickly to the gentle\r\npressure of affection, the pat of approval, the jerk of impatience, the\r\nfirm motion of command, and to the many other variations of the almost\r\ninfinite language of the feelings; and she has become so expert in\r\ninterpreting this unconscious language of the emotions that she is often\r\nable to divine our very thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn my account of Helen last year, I mentioned several instances where\r\nshe seemed to have called into use an inexplicable mental faculty; but\r\nit now seems to me, after carefully considering the matter, that this\r\npower may be explained by her perfect familiarity with the muscular\r\nvariations of those with whom she comes into contact, caused by their\r\nemotions. She has been forced to depend largely upon this muscular sense\r\nas a means of ascertaining the mental condition of those about her. She\r\nhas learned to connect certain movements of the body with anger, others\r\nwith joy, and others still with sorrow. One day, while she was out\r\nwalking with her mother and Mr. Anagnos, a boy threw a torpedo, which\r\nstartled Mrs. Keller. Helen felt the change in her mother\'s movements\r\ninstantly, and asked, "What are we afraid of?" On one occasion, while\r\nwalking on the Common with her, I saw a police officer taking a man\r\nto the station-house. The agitation which I felt evidently produced a\r\nperceptible physical change; for Helen asked, excitedly, "What do you\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\nA striking illustration of this strange power was recently shown while\r\nher ears were being examined by the aurists in Cincinnati. Several\r\nexperiments were tried, to determine positively whether or not she had\r\nany perception of sound. All present were astonished when she appeared\r\nnot only to hear a whistle, but also an ordinary tone of voice. She\r\nwould turn her head, smile, and act as though she had heard what was\r\nsaid. I was then standing beside her, holding her hand. Thinking that\r\nshe was receiving impressions from me, I put her hands upon the table,\r\nand withdrew to the opposite side of the room. The aurists then\r\ntried their experiments with quite different results. Helen remained\r\nmotionless through them all, not once showing the least sign that she\r\nrealized what was going on. At my suggestion, one of the gentlemen took\r\nher hand, and the tests were repeated. This time her countenance changed\r\nwhenever she was spoken to, but there was not such a decided lighting up\r\nof the features as when I had held her hand.\r\n\r\nIn the account of Helen last year it was stated that she knew nothing\r\nabout death, or the burial of the body; yet on entering a cemetery\r\nfor the first time in her life, she showed signs of emotion--her eyes\r\nactually filling with tears.\r\n\r\nA circumstance equally remarkable occurred last summer; but, before\r\nrelating it, I will mention what she now knows with regard to death.\r\nEven before I knew her, she had handled a dead chicken, or bird, or some\r\nother small animal. Some time after the visit to the cemetery before\r\nreferred to, Helen became interested in a horse that had met with an\r\naccident by which one of his legs had been badly injured, and she went\r\ndaily with me to visit him. The wounded leg soon became so much worse\r\nthat the horse was suspended from a beam. The animal groaned with pain,\r\nand Helen, perceiving his groans, was filled with pity. At last it\r\nbecame necessary to kill him, and, when Helen next asked to go and see\r\nhim, I told her that he was DEAD. This was the first time that she had\r\nheard the word. I then explained that he had been shot to relieve him\r\nfrom suffering, and that he was now BURIED--put into the ground. I am\r\ninclined to believe that the idea of his having been intentionally shot\r\ndid not make much impression upon her; but I think she did realize the\r\nfact that life was extinct in the horse as in the dead birds she had\r\ntouched, and also that he had been put into the ground. Since this\r\noccurrence, I have used the word DEAD whenever occasion required, but\r\nwith no further explanation of its meaning.\r\n\r\nWhile making a visit at Brewster, Massachusetts, she one day accompanied\r\nmy friend and me through the graveyard. She examined one stone after\r\nanother, and seemed pleased when she could decipher a name. She smelt of\r\nthe flowers, but showed no desire to pluck them; and, when I gathered\r\na few for her, she refused to have them pinned on her dress. When her\r\nattention was drawn to a marble slab inscribed with the name FLORENCE\r\nin relief, she dropped upon the ground as though looking for something,\r\nthen turned to me with a face full of trouble, and asked, "Were is poor\r\nlittle Florence?" I evaded the question, but she persisted. Turning to\r\nmy friend, she asked, "Did you cry loud for poor little Florence?" Then\r\nshe added: "I think she is very dead. Who put her in big hole?" As she\r\ncontinued to ask these distressing questions, we left the cemetery.\r\nFlorence was the daughter of my friend, and was a young lady at the time\r\nof her death; but Helen had been told nothing about her, nor did she\r\neven know that my friend had had a daughter. Helen had been given a bed\r\nand carriage for her dolls, which she had received and used like any\r\nother gift. On her return to the house after her visit to the cemetery,\r\nshe ran to the closet where these toys were kept, and carried them to\r\nmy friend, saying, "They are poor little Florence\'s." This was true,\r\nalthough we were at a loss to understand how she guessed it. A letter\r\nwritten to her mother in the course of the following week gave an\r\naccount of her impression in her own words:\r\n\r\n"I put my little babies to sleep in Florence\'s little bed, and I take\r\nthem to ride in her carriage. Poor little Florence is dead. She was very\r\nsick and died. Mrs. H. did cry loud for her dear little child. She got\r\nin the ground, and she is very dirty, and she is cold. Florence was very\r\nlovely like Sadie, and Mrs. H. kissed her and hugged her much. Florence\r\nis very sad in big hole. Doctor gave her medicine to make her well, but\r\npoor Florence did not get well. When she was very sick she tossed and\r\nmoaned in bed. Mrs. H. will go to see her soon."\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the activity of Helen\'s mind, she is a very natural\r\nchild. She is fond of fun and frolic, and loves dearly to be with other\r\nchildren. She is never fretful or irritable, and I have never seen her\r\nimpatient with her playmates because they failed to understand her.\r\nShe will play for hours together with children who cannot understand a\r\nsingle word she spells, and it is pathetic to watch the eager gestures\r\nand excited pantomime through which her ideas and emotions find\r\nexpression. Occasionally some little boy or girl will try to learn the\r\nmanual alphabet. Then it is beautiful to observe with what patience,\r\nsweetness, and perseverance Helen endeavours to bring the unruly fingers\r\nof her little friend into proper position.\r\n\r\nOne day, while Helen was wearing a little jacket of which she was very\r\nproud, her mother said: "There is a poor little girl who has no cloak\r\nto keep her warm. Will you give her yours?" Helen began to pull off the\r\njacket, saying, "I must give it to a poor little strange girl."\r\n\r\nShe is very fond of children younger than herself, and a baby invariably\r\ncalls forth all the motherly instincts of her nature. She will handle\r\nthe baby as tenderly as the most careful nurse could desire. It is\r\npleasant, too, to note her thoughtfulness for little children, and her\r\nreadiness to yield to their whims.\r\n\r\nShe has a very sociable disposition, and delights in the companionship\r\nof those who can follow the rapid motions of her fingers; but if left\r\nalone she will amuse herself for hours at a time with her knitting or\r\nsewing.\r\n\r\nShe reads a great deal. She bends over her book with a look of intense\r\ninterest, and as the forefinger of her left hand runs along the line,\r\nshe spells out the words with the other hand; but often her motions are\r\nso rapid as to be unintelligible even to those accustomed to reading the\r\nswift and varied movements of her fingers.\r\n\r\nEvery shade of feeling finds expression through her mobile features.\r\nHer behaviour is easy and natural, and it is charming because of its\r\nfrankness and evident sincerity. Her heart is too full of unselfishness\r\nand affection to allow a dream of fear or unkindness. She does not\r\nrealize that one can be anything but kind-hearted and tender. She is\r\nnot conscious of any reason why she should be awkward; consequently, her\r\nmovements are free and graceful.\r\n\r\nShe is very fond of all the living things at home, and she will not have\r\nthem unkindly treated. When she is riding in the carriage she will not\r\nallow the driver to use the whip, because, she says, "poor horses will\r\ncry." One morning she was greatly distressed by finding that one of the\r\ndogs had a block fastened to her collar. We explained that it was\r\ndone to keep Pearl from running away. Helen expressed a great deal of\r\nsympathy, and at every opportunity during the day she would find Pearl\r\nand carry the burden from place to place.\r\n\r\nHer father wrote to her last summer that the birds and bees were eating\r\nall his grapes. At first she was very indignant, and said the little\r\ncreatures were "very wrong"; but she seemed pleased when I explained to\r\nher that the birds and bees were hungry, and did not know that it was\r\nselfish to eat all the fruit. In a letter written soon afterward she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry that bumblebees and hornets and birds and large flies\r\nand worms are eating all of my father\'s delicious grapes. They like\r\njuicy fruit to eat as well as people, and they are hungry. They are not\r\nvery wrong to eat too many grapes because they do not know much."\r\n\r\nShe continues to make rapid progress in the acquisition of language\r\nas her experiences increase. While these were few and elementary, her\r\nvocabulary was necessarily limited; but, as she learns more of the world\r\nabout her, her judgment grows more accurate, her reasoning powers\r\ngrow stronger, more active and subtle, and the language by which she\r\nexpresses this intellectual activity gains in fluency and logic.\r\n\r\nWhen traveling she drinks in thought and language. Sitting beside her\r\nin the car, I describe what I see from the window--hills and valleys and\r\nthe rivers; cotton-fields and gardens in which strawberries, peaches,\r\npears, melons, and vegetables are growing; herds of cows and horses\r\nfeeding in broad meadows, and flocks of sheep on the hillside; the\r\ncities with their churches and schools, hotels and warehouses, and the\r\noccupations of the busy people. While I am communicating these things,\r\nHelen manifests intense interest; and, in default of words, she\r\nindicates by gestures and pantomime her desire to learn more of her\r\nsurroundings and of the great forces which are operating everywhere.\r\nIn this way, she learns countless new expressions without any apparent\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when Helen first grasped the idea that all objects have\r\nnames, and that these can be communicated by certain movements of the\r\nfingers, I have talked to her exactly as I should have done had she been\r\nable to hear, with only this exception, that I have addressed the words\r\nto her fingers instead of to her ears. Naturally, there was at first\r\na strong tendency on her part to use only the important words in a\r\nsentence. She would say: "Helen milk." I got the milk to show her that\r\nshe had used the correct word; but I did not let her drink it until she\r\nhad, with my assistance, made a complete sentence, as "Give Helen some\r\nmilk to drink." In these early lessons I encouraged her in the use of\r\ndifferent forms of expression for conveying the same idea. If she was\r\neating some candy, I said: "Will Helen please give teacher some candy?"\r\nor, "Teacher would like to eat some of Helen\'s candy," emphasizing the\r\n\'s. She very soon perceived that the same idea could be expressed in a\r\ngreat many ways. In two or three months after I began to teach her she\r\nwould say: "Helen wants to go to bed," or, "Helen is sleepy, and Helen\r\nwill go to bed."\r\n\r\nI am constantly asked the question, "How did you teach her the meaning\r\nof words expressive of intellectual and moral qualities?" I believe it\r\nwas more through association and repetition than through any explanation\r\nof mine. This is especially true of her earlier lessons, when her\r\nknowledge of language was so slight as to make explanation impossible.\r\n\r\nI always made it a practice to use the words descriptive of emotions,\r\nof intellectual or moral qualities and actions, in connection with the\r\ncircumstance which required these words. Soon after I became her teacher\r\nHelen broke her new doll, of which she was very fond. She began to cry.\r\nI said to her, "Teacher is SORRY." After a few repetitions she came to\r\nassociate the word with the feeling.\r\n\r\nThe word HAPPY she learned in the same way; ALSO, RIGHT, WRONG, GOOD,\r\nBAD, and other adjectives. The word LOVE she learned as other children\r\ndo--by its association with caresses.\r\n\r\nOne day I asked her a simple question in a combination of numbers, which\r\nI was sure she knew. She answered at random. I checked her, and she\r\nstood still, the expression of her face plainly showing that she was\r\ntrying to think. I touched her forehead, and spelled "t-h-i-n-k." The\r\nword, thus connected with the act, seemed to impress itself on her mind\r\nmuch as if I had placed her hand upon an object and then spelled its\r\nname. Since that time she has always used the word THINK.\r\n\r\nAt a later period I began to use such words as PERHAPS, SUPPOSE, EXPECT,\r\nFORGET, REMEMBER. If Helen asked, "Where is mother now?" I replied: "I\r\ndo not know. PERHAPS she is with Leila."\r\n\r\nShe is always anxious to learn the names of people we meet in the\r\nhorse-cars or elsewhere, and to know where they are going, and what they\r\nwill do. Conversations of this kind are frequent:\r\n\r\nHELEN. What is little boy\'s name?\r\n\r\nTEACHER. I do not know, for he is a little stranger; but PERHAPS his\r\nname is Jack.\r\n\r\nHELEN. Where is he going?\r\n\r\nTEACHER. He MAY BE going to the Common to have fun with other boys.\r\n\r\nHELEN. What will he play?\r\n\r\nTEACHER. I SUPPOSE he will play ball.\r\n\r\nHELEN. What are boys doing now?\r\n\r\nTEACHER. PERHAPS they are expecting Jack, and are waiting for him.\r\n\r\nAfter the words have become familiar to her, she uses them in\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember 26, [1888].\r\n\r\n"This morning teacher and I sat by the window and we saw a little boy\r\nwalking on the sidewalk. It was raining very hard and he had a very\r\nlarge umbrella to keep off the rain-drops.\r\n\r\n"I do not know how old he was but THINK he MAY HAVE BEEN six years old.\r\nPERHAPS his name was Joe. I do not know where he was going because he\r\nwas a little strange boy. But PERHAPS his mother sent him to a store\r\nto buy something for dinner. He had a bag in one hand. I SUPPOSE he was\r\ngoing to take it to his mother."\r\n\r\nIn teaching her the use of language, I have not confined myself to any\r\nparticular theory or system. I have observed the spontaneous movements\r\nof my pupil\'s mind, and have tried to follow the suggestions thus given\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nOwing to the nervousness of Helen\'s temperament, every precaution has\r\nbeen taken to avoid unduly exciting her already very active brain.\r\nThe greater part of the year has been spent in travel and in visits\r\nto different places, and her lessons have been those suggested by\r\nthe various scenes and experiences through which she has passed. She\r\ncontinues to manifest the same eagerness to learn as at first. It is\r\nnever necessary to urge her to study. Indeed, I am often obliged to coax\r\nher to leave an example or a composition.\r\n\r\nWhile not confining myself to any special system of instruction, I have\r\ntried to add to her general information and intelligence, to enlarge\r\nher acquaintance with things around her, and to bring her into easy and\r\nnatural relations with people. I have encouraged her to keep a diary,\r\nfrom which the following selection has been made:\r\n\r\n\r\n"March 22nd, 1888.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Anagnos came to see me Thursday. I was glad to hug and kiss him. He\r\ntakes care of sixty little blind girls and seventy little blind boys. I\r\ndo love them. Little blind girls sent me a pretty work-basket. I found\r\nscissors and thread, and needle-book with many needles in it, and\r\ncrochet hook and emery, and thimble, and box, and yard measure and\r\nbuttons, and pin-cushion. I will write little blind girls a letter to\r\nthank them. I will make pretty clothes for Nancy and Adeline and Allie.\r\nI will go to Cincinnati in May and buy another child. Then I will have\r\nfour children. New baby\'s name is Harry. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Mitchell\r\ncame to see us Sunday. Mr. Anagnos went to Louisville Monday to see\r\nlittle blind children. Mother went to Huntsville. I slept with father,\r\nand Mildred slept with teacher. I did learn about calm. It does mean\r\nquiet and happy. Uncle Morrie sent me pretty stories. I read about\r\nbirds. The quail lays fifteen or twenty eggs and they are white. She\r\nmakes her nest on the ground. The blue-bird makes her nest in a hollow\r\ntree and her eggs are blue. The robin\'s eggs are green. I learned a song\r\nabout spring. March, April, May are spring.\r\n\r\nNow melts the snow. The warm winds blow The waters flow And robin dear,\r\nIs come to show That Spring is here.\r\n\r\n\r\n"James killed snipes for breakfast. Little chickens did get very cold\r\nand die. I am sorry. Teacher and I went to ride on Tennessee River, in\r\na boat. I saw Mr. Wilson and James row with oars. Boat did glide swiftly\r\nand I put hand in water and felt it flowing.\r\n\r\n"I caught fish with hook and line and pole. We climbed high hill and\r\nteacher fell and hurt her head. I ate very small fish for supper. I did\r\nread about cow and calf. The cow loves to eat grass as well as girl does\r\nbread and butter and milk. Little calf does run and leap in field. She\r\nlikes to skip and play, for she is happy when the sun is bright and\r\nwarm. Little boy did love his calf. And he did say, I will kiss you,\r\nlittle calf, and he put his arms around calf\'s neck and kissed her. The\r\ncalf licked good boy\'s face with long rough tongue. Calf must not open\r\nmouth much to kiss. I am tired, and teacher does not want me to write\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nIn the autumn she went to a circus. While we were standing before\r\nhis cage the lion roared, and Helen felt the vibration of the air so\r\ndistinctly that she was able to reproduce the noise quite accurately.\r\n\r\nI tried to describe to her the appearance of a camel; but, as we were\r\nnot allowed to touch the animal, I feared that she did not get a correct\r\nidea of its shape. A few days afterward, however, hearing a commotion in\r\nthe schoolroom, I went in and found Helen on all fours with a pillow so\r\nstrapped upon her back as to leave a hollow in the middle, thus making a\r\nhump on either side. Between these humps she had placed her doll, which\r\nshe was giving a ride around the room. I watched her for some time as\r\nshe moved about, trying to take long strides in order to carry out the\r\nidea I had given her of a camel\'s gait. When I asked her what she was\r\ndoing, she replied, "I am a very funny camel."\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next two years neither Mr. Anagnos, who was in Europe for\r\na year, nor Miss Sullivan wrote anything about Helen Keller for\r\npublication. In 1892 appeared the Perkins Institution report for\r\n1891, containing a full account of Helen Keller, including many of her\r\nletters, exercises, and compositions. As some of the letters and the\r\nstory of the "Frost King" are published here, there is no need of\r\nprinting any more samples of Helen Keller\'s writing during the third,\r\nfourth and fifth years of her education. It was the first two years\r\nthat counted. From Miss Sullivan\'s part of this report I give her most\r\nimportant comments and such biographical matter as does not appear\r\nelsewhere in the present volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese extracts Mr. Anagnos took from Miss Sullivan\'s notes and\r\nmemoranda.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, while her pony and her donkey were standing side by side, Helen\r\nwent from one to the other, examining them closely. At last she paused\r\nwith her hand upon Neddy\'s head, and addressed him thus: "Yes, dear\r\nNeddy, it is true that you are not as beautiful as Black Beauty. Your\r\nbody is not so handsomely formed, and there is no proud look in your\r\nface, and your neck does not arch, Besides, your long ears make you look\r\na little funny. Of course, you cannot help it, and I love you just as\r\nwell as if you were the most beautiful creature in the world."\r\n\r\nHelen has been greatly interested in the story of "Black Beauty." To\r\nshow how quickly she perceives and associates ideas, I will give an\r\ninstance which all who have read the book will be able to appreciate. I\r\nwas reading the following paragraph to her:\r\n\r\n"The horse was an old, worn-out chestnut, with an ill-kept coat, and\r\nbones that showed plainly through it; the knees knuckled over, and the\r\nforelegs were very unsteady. I had been eating some hay, and the wind\r\nrolled a little lock of it that way, and the poor creature put out her\r\nlong, thin neck and picked it up, and then turned round and looked about\r\nfor more. There was a hopeless look in the dull eye that I could not\r\nhelp noticing, and then, as I was thinking where I had seen that horse\r\nbefore, she looked full at me and said, \'Black Beauty, is that you?\'"\r\n\r\nAt this point Helen pressed my hand to stop me. She was sobbing\r\nconvulsively. "It was poor Ginger," was all she could say at first.\r\nLater, when she was able to talk about it, she said: "Poor Ginger! The\r\nwords made a distinct picture in my mind. I could see the way Ginger\r\nlooked; all her beauty gone, her beautiful arched neck drooping, all the\r\nspirit gone out of her flashing eyes, all the playfulness gone out of\r\nher manner. Oh, how terrible it was! I never knew before that there\r\ncould be such a change in anything. There were very few spots of\r\nsunshine in poor Ginger\'s life, and the sadnesses were so many!" After a\r\nmoment she added, mournfully, "I fear some people\'s lives are just like\r\nGinger\'s."\r\n\r\nThis morning Helen was reading for the first time Bryant\'s poem, "Oh,\r\nmother of a mighty race!" I said to her, "Tell me, when you have read\r\nthe poem through, who you think the mother is." When she came to the\r\nline, "There\'s freedom at thy gates, and rest," she exclaimed: "It means\r\nAmerica! The gate, I suppose, is New York City, and Freedom is the great\r\nstatue of Liberty." After she had read "The Battlefield," by the same\r\nauthor, I asked her which verse she thought was the most beautiful. She\r\nreplied, "I like this verse best:\r\n\r\n\'Truth crushed to earth shall rise again; The eternal years of God\r\nare hers; But Error, wounded, writhes with pain, And dies among his\r\nworshipers.\'"\r\n\r\nShe is at once transported into the midst of the events of a story. She\r\nrejoices when justice wins, she is sad when virtue lies low, and\r\nher face glows with admiration and reverence when heroic deeds are\r\ndescribed. She even enters into the spirit of battle; she says, "I think\r\nit is right for men to fight against wrongs and tyrants."\r\n\r\n\r\nHere begins Miss Sullivan\'s connected account in the report of 1891:\r\n\r\nDuring the past three years Helen has continued to make rapid progress\r\nin the acquisition of language. She has one advantage over ordinary\r\nchildren, that nothing from without distracts her attention from her\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nBut this advantage involves a corresponding disadvantage, the danger of\r\nunduly severe mental application. Her mind is so constituted that she\r\nis in a state of feverish unrest while conscious that there is something\r\nthat she does not comprehend. I have never known her to be willing to\r\nleave a lesson when she felt that there was anything in it which she did\r\nnot understand. If I suggest her leaving a problem in arithmetic until\r\nthe next day, she answers, "I think it will make my mind stronger to do\r\nit now."\r\n\r\nA few evenings ago we were discussing the tariff. Helen wanted me to\r\ntell her about it. I said: "No. You cannot understand it yet." She was\r\nquiet for a moment, and then asked, with spirit: "How do you know that I\r\ncannot understand? I have a good mind! You must remember, dear teacher,\r\nthat Greek parents were very particular with their children, and they\r\nused to let them listen to wise words, and I think they understood\r\nsome of them." I have found it best not to tell her that she cannot\r\nunderstand, because she is almost certain to become excited.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I tried to show her how to build a tower with her blocks.\r\nAs the design was somewhat complicated, the slightest jar made the\r\nstructure fall. After a time I became discouraged, and told her I was\r\nafraid she could not make it stand, but that I would build it for her;\r\nbut she did not approve of this plan. She was determined to build the\r\ntower herself; and for nearly three hours she worked away, patiently\r\ngathering up the blocks whenever they fell, and beginning over again,\r\nuntil at last her perseverance was crowned with success. The tower stood\r\ncomplete in every part.\r\n\r\nUntil October, 1889, I had not deemed it best to confine Helen to any\r\nregular and systematic course of study. For the first two years of\r\nher intellectual life she was like a child in a strange country, where\r\neverything was new and perplexing; and, until she gained a knowledge\r\nof language, it was not possible to give her a definite course of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Helen\'s inquisitiveness was so great during these years\r\nthat it would have interfered with her progress in the acquisition of\r\nlanguage, if a consideration of the questions which were constantly\r\noccurring to her had been deferred until the completion of a lesson.\r\nIn all probability she would have forgotten the question, and a good\r\nopportunity to explain something of real interest to her would have\r\nbeen lost. Therefore it has always seemed best to me to teach anything\r\nwhenever my pupil needed to know it, whether it had any bearing on the\r\nprojected lesson or not, her inquiries have often led us far away from\r\nthe subject under immediate consideration.\r\n\r\nSince October, 1889, her work has been more regular and has included\r\narithmetic, geography, zoology, botany and reading.\r\n\r\nShe has made considerable progress in the study of arithmetic. She\r\nreadily explains the processes of multiplication, addition, subtraction,\r\nand division, and seems to understand the operations. She has nearly\r\nfinished Colburn\'s mental arithmetic, her last work being in improper\r\nfractions. She has also done some good work in written arithmetic. Her\r\nmind works so rapidly, that it often happens, that when I give her an\r\nexample she will give me the correct answer before I have time to write\r\nout the question. She pays little attention to the language used in\r\nstating a problem, and seldom stops to ask the meaning of unknown words\r\nor phrases until she is ready to explain her work. Once, when a question\r\npuzzled her very much, I suggested that we take a walk and then perhaps\r\nshe would understand it. She shook her head decidedly, and said: "My\r\nenemies would think I was running away. I must stay and conquer them\r\nnow," and she did.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual improvement which Helen has made in the past two years\r\nis shown more clearly in her greater command of language and in her\r\nability to recognize nicer shades of meaning in the use of words, than\r\nin any other branch of her education.\r\n\r\nNot a day passes that she does not learn many new words, nor are these\r\nmerely the names of tangible and sensible objects. For instance, she\r\none day wished to know the meaning of the following words: PHENOMENON,\r\nCOMPRISE, ENERGY, REPRODUCTION, EXTRAORDINARY, PERPETUAL and MYSTERY.\r\nSome of these words have successive steps of meaning, beginning with\r\nwhat is simple and leading on to what is abstract. It would have been a\r\nhopeless task to make Helen comprehend the more abstruse meanings of\r\nthe word MYSTERY, but she understood readily that it signified something\r\nhidden or concealed, and when she makes greater progress she will\r\ngrasp its more abstruse meaning as easily as she now does the simpler\r\nsignification. In investigating any subject there must occur at the\r\nbeginning words and phrases which cannot be adequately understood until\r\nthe pupil has made considerable advancement; yet I have thought it best\r\nto go on giving my pupil simple definitions, thinking that, although\r\nthese may be somewhat vague and provisional, they will come to one\r\nanother\'s assistance, and that what is obscure to-day will be plain\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nI regard my pupil as a free and active being, whose own spontaneous\r\nimpulses must be my surest guide. I have always talked to Helen exactly\r\nas I would talk to a seeing and hearing child, and I have insisted that\r\nother people should do the same. Whenever any one asks me if she will\r\nunderstand this or that word I always reply: "Never mind whether she\r\nunderstands each separate word of a sentence or not. She will guess the\r\nmeanings of the new words from their connection with others which are\r\nalready intelligible to her."\r\n\r\nIn selecting books for Helen to read, I have never chosen them with\r\nreference to her deafness and blindness. She always reads such books as\r\nseeing and hearing children of her age read and enjoy. Of course, in the\r\nbeginning it was necessary that the things described should be familiar\r\nand interesting, and the English pure and simple. I remember distinctly\r\nwhen she first attempted to read a little story. She had learned the\r\nprinted letters, and for some time had amused herself by making simple\r\nsentences, using slips on which the words were printed in raised\r\nletters; but these sentences had no special relation to one another. One\r\nmorning we caught a mouse, and it occurred to me, with a live mouse\r\nand a live cat to stimulate her interest, that I might arrange some\r\nsentences in such a way as to form a little story, and thus give her a\r\nnew conception of the use of language. So I put the following sentences\r\nin the frame, and gave it to Helen: "The cat is on the box. A mouse is\r\nin the box. The cat can see the mouse. The cat would like to eat the\r\nmouse. Do not let the cat get the mouse. The cat can have some milk,\r\nand the mouse can have some cake." The word THE she did not know, and\r\nof course she wished it explained. At that stage of her advancement it\r\nwould have been impossible to explain its use, and so I did not try, but\r\nmoved her finger on to the next word, which she recognized with a bright\r\nsmile. Then, as I put her hand upon puss sitting on the box, she made\r\na little exclamation of surprise, and the rest of the sentence became\r\nperfectly clear to her. When she had read the words of the second\r\nsentence, I showed her that there really was a mouse in the box. She\r\nthen moved her finger to the next line with an expression of eager\r\ninterest. "The cat can see the mouse." Here I made the cat look at the\r\nmouse, and let Helen feel the cat. The expression of the little girl\'s\r\ncountenance showed that she was perplexed. I called her attention to the\r\nfollowing line, and, although she knew only the three words, CAT, EAT\r\nand MOUSE, she caught the idea. She pulled the cat away and put her on\r\nthe floor, at the same time covering the box with the frame. When she\r\nread, "Do not let the cat get the mouse!" she recognized the negation\r\nin the sentence, and seemed to know that the cat must not get the mouse.\r\nGET and LET were new words. She was familiar with the words of the last\r\nsentence, and was delighted when allowed to act them out. By signs she\r\nmade me understand that she wished another story, and I gave her a book\r\ncontaining very short stories, written in the most elementary style. She\r\nran her fingers along the lines, finding the words she knew and\r\nguessing at the meaning of others, in a way that would convince the\r\nmost conservative of educators that a little deaf child, if given the\r\nopportunity, will learn to read as easily and naturally as ordinary\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that Helen\'s use of English is due largely to her\r\nfamiliarity with books. She often reads for two or three hours in\r\nsuccession, and then lays aside her book reluctantly. One day as we left\r\nthe library I noticed that she appeared more serious than usual, and\r\nI asked the cause. "I am thinking how much wiser we always are when we\r\nleave here than we are when we come," was her reply.\r\n\r\nWhen asked why she loved books so much, she once replied: "Because they\r\ntell me so much that is interesting about things I cannot see, and they\r\nare never tired or troubled like people. They tell me over and over what\r\nI want to know."\r\n\r\nWhile reading from Dickens\'s "Child\'s History of England," we came to\r\nthe sentence, "Still the spirit of the Britons was not broken." I asked\r\nwhat she thought that meant. She replied, "I think it means that the\r\nbrave Britons were not discouraged because the Romans had won so many\r\nbattles, and they wished all the more to drive them away." It would not\r\nhave been possible for her to define the words in this sentence; and yet\r\nshe had caught the author\'s meaning, and was able to give it in her own\r\nwords. The next lines are still more idiomatic, "When Suetonius left the\r\ncountry, they fell upon his troops and retook the island of Anglesea."\r\nHere is her interpretation of the sentence: "It means that when the\r\nRoman general had gone away, the Britons began to fight again; and\r\nbecause the Roman soldiers had no general to tell them what to do, they\r\nwere overcome by the Britons and lost the island they had captured."\r\n\r\nShe prefers intellectual to manual occupations, and is not so fond of\r\nfancy work as many of the blind children are; yet she is eager to join\r\nthem in whatever they are doing. She has learned to use the Caligraph\r\ntypewriter, and writes very correctly, but not rapidly as yet, having\r\nhad less than a month\'s practice.\r\n\r\nMore than two years ago a cousin taught her the telegraph alphabet by\r\nmaking the dots and dashes on the back of her hand with his finger.\r\nWhenever she meets any one who is familiar with this system, she is\r\ndelighted to use it in conversation. I have found it a convenient medium\r\nof communicating with Helen when she is at some distance from me, for it\r\nenables me to talk with her by tapping upon the floor with my foot. She\r\nfeels the vibrations and understands what is said to her.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that one so peculiarly endowed by nature as Helen, would,\r\nif left entirely to her own resources, throw some light upon such\r\npsychological questions as were not exhaustively investigated by Dr.\r\nHowe; but their hopes were not to be realized. In the case of Helen,\r\nas in that of Laura Bridgman, disappointment was inevitable. It is\r\nimpossible to isolate a child in the midst of society, so that he shall\r\nnot be influenced by the beliefs of those with whom he associates. In\r\nHelen\'s case such an end could not have been attained without depriving\r\nher of that intercourse with others, which is essential to her nature.\r\n\r\nIt must have been evident to those who watched the rapid unfolding of\r\nHelen\'s faculties that it would not be possible to keep her inquisitive\r\nspirit for any length of time from reaching out toward the unfathomable\r\nmysteries of life. But great care has been taken not to lead her\r\nthoughts prematurely to the consideration of subjects which perplex\r\nand confuse all minds. Children ask profound questions, but they often\r\nreceive shallow answers, or, to speak more correctly, they are quieted\r\nby such answers.\r\n\r\n"Were did I come from?" and "Where shall I go when I die?" were\r\nquestions Helen asked when she was eight years old. But the explanations\r\nwhich she was able to understand at that time did not satisfy, although\r\nthey forced her to remain silent, until her mind should begin to put\r\nforth its higher powers, and generalize from innumerable impressions\r\nand ideas which streamed in upon it from books and from her daily\r\nexperiences. Her mind sought for the cause of things.\r\n\r\nAs her observation of phenomena became more extensive and her vocabulary\r\nricher and more subtle, enabling her to express her own conceptions and\r\nideas clearly, and also to comprehend the thoughts and experiences of\r\nothers, she became acquainted with the limit of human creative power,\r\nand perceived that some power, not human, must have created the earth,\r\nthe sun, and the thousand natural objects with which she was perfectly\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nFinally she one day demanded a name for the power, the existence of\r\nwhich she had already conceived in her own mind.\r\n\r\nThrough Charles Kingsley\'s "Greek Heroes" she had become familiar with\r\nthe beautiful stories of the Greek gods and goddesses, and she must\r\nhave met with the words GOD, HEAVEN, SOUL, and a great many similar\r\nexpressions in books.\r\n\r\nShe never asked the meaning of such words, nor made any comment when\r\nthey occurred; and until February, 1889, no one had ever spoken to her\r\nof God. At that time, a dear relative who was also an earnest Christian,\r\ntried to tell her about God but, as this lady did not use words suited\r\nto the comprehension of the child, they made little impression upon\r\nHelen\'s mind. When I subsequently talked with her she said: "I have\r\nsomething very funny to tell you. A. says God made me and every one out\r\nof sand; but it must be a joke. I am made of flesh and blood and bone,\r\nam I not?" Here she examined her arm with evident satisfaction, laughing\r\nheartily to herself. After a moment she went on: "A. says God is\r\neverywhere, and that He is all love; but I do not think a person can\r\nbe made out of love. Love is only something in our hearts. Then A. said\r\nanother very comical thing. She says He (meaning God) is my dear father.\r\nIt made me laugh quite hard, for I know my father is Arthur Keller."\r\n\r\nI explained to her that she was not yet able to understand what had been\r\ntold her, and so easily led her to see that it would be better not to\r\ntalk about such things until she was wiser.\r\n\r\nShe had met with the expression Mother Nature in the course of her\r\nreading, and for a long time she was in the habit of ascribing to Mother\r\nNature whatever she felt to be beyond the power of man to accomplish.\r\nShe would say, when speaking of the growth of a plant, "Mother Nature\r\nsends the sunshine and the rain to make the trees and the grass and the\r\nflowers grow." The following extract from my notes will show what were\r\nher ideas at this time:\r\n\r\nHelen seemed a little serious after supper, and Mrs. H. asked her of\r\nwhat she was thinking. "I am thinking how very busy dear Mother Nature\r\nis in the springtime," she replied. When asked why, she answered:\r\n"Because she has so many children to take care of. She is the mother of\r\neverything; the flowers and trees and winds."\r\n\r\n"How does Mother Nature take care of the flowers?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"She sends the sunshine and rain to make them grow," Helen replied; and\r\nafter a moment she added, "I think the sunshine is Nature\'s warm smile,\r\nand the raindrops are her tears."\r\n\r\nLater she said: "I do not know if Mother Nature made me. I think my\r\nmother got me from heaven, but I do not know where that place is. I\r\nknow that daisies and pansies come from seeds which have been put in the\r\nground; but children do not grow out of the ground, I am sure. I have\r\nnever seen a plant-child! But I cannot imagine who made Mother Nature,\r\ncan you? I love the beautiful spring, because the budding trees and the\r\nblossoming flowers and the tender green leaves fill my heart with joy.\r\nI must go now to see my garden. The daisies and the pansies will think I\r\nhave forgotten them."\r\n\r\nAfter May, 1890, it was evident to me that she had reached a point where\r\nit was impossible to keep from her the religious beliefs held by those\r\nwith whom she was in daily contact. She almost overwhelmed me\r\nwith inquiries which were the natural outgrowth of her quickened\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nEarly in May she wrote on her tablet the following list of questions:\r\n\r\n"I wish to write about things I do not understand. Who made the earth\r\nand the seas, and everything? What makes the sun hot? Where was I before\r\nI came to mother? I know that plants grow from seeds which are in\r\nthe ground, but I am sure people do not grow that way. I never saw a\r\nchild-plant. Little birds and chickens come out of eggs. I have seen\r\nthem. What was the egg before it was an egg? Why does not the earth\r\nfall, it is so very large and heavy? Tell me something that Father\r\nNature does. May I read the book called the Bible? Please tell your\r\nlittle pupil many things when you have much time."\r\n\r\nCan any one doubt after reading these questions that the child who was\r\ncapable of asking them was also capable of understanding at least\r\ntheir elementary answers? She could not, of course, have grasped such\r\nabstractions as a complete answer to her questions would involve;\r\nbut one\'s whole life is nothing more than a continual advance in the\r\ncomprehension of the meaning and scope of such ideas.\r\n\r\nThroughout Helen\'s education I have invariably assumed that she can\r\nunderstand whatever it is desirable for her to know. Unless there had\r\nbeen in Helen\'s mind some such intellectual process as the questions\r\nindicate, any explanation of them would have been unintelligible to her.\r\nWithout that degree of mental development and activity which perceives\r\nthe necessity of superhuman creative power, no explanation of natural\r\nphenomena is possible.\r\n\r\nAfter she had succeeded in formulating the ideas which had been slowly\r\ngrowing in her mind, they seemed suddenly to absorb all her thoughts,\r\nand she became impatient to have everything explained. As we were\r\npassing a large globe a short time after she had written the questions,\r\nshe stopped before it and asked, "Who made the REAL world?" I replied,\r\n"No one knows how the earth, the sun, and all the worlds which we call\r\nstars came to be; but I will tell you how wise men have tried to account\r\nfor their origin, and to interpret the great and mysterious forces of\r\nnature."\r\n\r\nShe knew that the Greeks had many gods to whom they ascribed various\r\npowers, because they believed that the sun, the lightning, and a hundred\r\nother natural forces, were independent and superhuman powers. But after\r\na great deal of thought and study, I told her, men came to believe that\r\nall forces were manifestations of one power, and to that power they gave\r\nthe name GOD.\r\n\r\nShe was very still for a few minutes, evidently thinking earnestly. She\r\nthen asked, "Who made God?" I was compelled to evade her question, for\r\nI could not explain to her the mystery of a self-existent being. Indeed,\r\nmany of her eager questions would have puzzled a far wiser person than\r\nI am. Here are some of them: "What did God make the new worlds out of?"\r\n"Where did He get the soil, and the water, and the seeds, and the first\r\nanimals?" "Where is God?" "Did you ever see God?" I told her that God\r\nwas everywhere, and that she must not think of Him as a person, but\r\nas the life, the mind, the soul of everything. She interrupted me:\r\n"Everything does not have life. The rocks have not life, and they cannot\r\nthink." It is often necessary to remind her that there are infinitely\r\nmany things that the wisest people in the world cannot explain.\r\n\r\nNo creed or dogma has been taught to Helen, nor has any effort been made\r\nto force religious beliefs upon her attention. Being fully aware of my\r\nown incompetence to give her any adequate explanations of the mysteries\r\nwhich underlie the names of God, soul, and immortality, I have always\r\nfelt obliged, by a sense of duty to my pupil, to say as little as\r\npossible about spiritual matters. The Rt. Rev. Phillips Brooks has\r\nexplained to her in a beautiful way the fatherhood of God.\r\n\r\nShe has not as yet been allowed to read the Bible, because I do not see\r\nhow she can do so at present without getting a very erroneous conception\r\nof the attributes of God. I have already told her in simple language\r\nof the beautiful and helpful life of Jesus, and of His cruel death. The\r\nnarrative affected her greatly when first she listened to it.\r\n\r\nWhen she referred to our conversation again, it was to ask, "Why did not\r\nJesus go away, so that His enemies could not find Him?" She thought the\r\nmiracles of Jesus very strange. When told that Jesus walked on the sea\r\nto meet His disciples, she said, decidedly, "It does not mean WALKED, it\r\nmeans SWAM." When told of the instance in which Jesus raised the dead,\r\nshe was much perplexed, saying, "I did not know life could come back\r\ninto the dead body!"\r\n\r\nOne day she said, sadly: "I am blind and deaf. That is why I cannot see\r\nGod." I taught her the word INVISIBLE, and told her we could not see God\r\nwith our eyes, because He was a spirit; but that when our hearts were\r\nfull of goodness and gentleness, then we saw Him because then we were\r\nmore like Him.\r\n\r\nAt another time she asked, "What is a soul?" "No one knows what the soul\r\nis like," I replied; "but we know that it is not the body, and it is\r\nthat part of us which thinks and loves and hopes, and which Christian\r\npeople believe will live on after the body is dead." I then asked her,\r\n"Can you think of your soul as separate from your body?" "Oh, yes!" she\r\nreplied; "because last hour I was thinking very hard of Mr. Anagnos, and\r\nthen my mind,"--then changing the word--"my soul was in Athens, but my\r\nbody was here in the study." At this moment another thought seemed to\r\nflash through her mind, and she added, "But Mr. Anagnos did not speak\r\nto my soul." I explained to her that the soul, too, is invisible, or in\r\nother words, that it is without apparent form. "But if I write what my\r\nsoul thinks," she said, "then it will be visible, and the words will be\r\nits body."\r\n\r\nA long time ago Helen said to me, "I would like to live sixteen hundred\r\nyears." When asked if she would not like to live ALWAYS in a beautiful\r\ncountry called heaven, her first question was, "Where is heaven?" I was\r\nobliged to confess that I did not know, but suggested that it might be\r\non one of the stars. A moment after she said, "Will you please go first\r\nand tell me all about it?" and then she added, "Tuscumbia is a very\r\nbeautiful little town." It was more than a year before she alluded to\r\nthe subject again, and when she did return to it, her questions were\r\nnumerous and persistent. She asked: "Where is heaven, and what is it\r\nlike? Why cannot we know as much about heaven as we do about foreign\r\ncountries?" I told her in very simple language that there may be many\r\nplaces called heaven, but that essentially it was a condition--the\r\nfulfilment of the heart\'s desire, the satisfaction of its wants; and\r\nthat heaven existed wherever RIGHT was acknowledged, believed in, and\r\nloved.\r\n\r\nShe shrinks from the thought of death with evident dismay. Recently, on\r\nbeing shown a deer which had been killed by her brother, she was greatly\r\ndistressed, and asked sorrowfully, "Why must everything die, even the\r\nfleet-footed deer?" At another time she asked, "Do you not think we\r\nwould be very much happier always, if we did not have to die?" I said,\r\n"No; because, if there were no death, our world would soon be so crowded\r\nwith living creatures that it would be impossible for any of them to\r\nlive comfortably." "But," said Helen, quickly, "I think God could make\r\nsome more worlds as well as He made this one."\r\n\r\nWhen friends have told her of the great happiness which awaits her in\r\nanother life, she instantly asked: "How do you know, if you have not\r\nbeen dead?"\r\n\r\nThe literal sense in which she sometimes takes common words and idioms\r\nshows how necessary it is that we should make sure that she receives\r\ntheir correct meaning. When told recently that Hungarians were born\r\nmusicians, she asked in surprise, "Do they sing when they are born?"\r\nWhen her friend added that some of the pupils he had seen in Budapest\r\nhad more than one hundred tunes in their heads, she said, laughing, "I\r\nthink their heads must be very noisy." She sees the ridiculous quickly,\r\nand, instead of being seriously troubled by metaphorical language, she\r\nis often amused at her own too literal conception of its meaning.\r\n\r\nHaving been told that the soul was without form, she was much perplexed\r\nat David\'s words, "He leadeth my soul." "Has it feet? Can it walk? Is it\r\nblind?" she asked; for in her mind the idea of being led was associated\r\nwith blindness.\r\n\r\nOf all the subjects which perplex and trouble Helen, none distresses her\r\nso much as the knowledge of the existence of evil, and of the suffering\r\nwhich results from it. For a long time it was possible to keep this\r\nknowledge from her; and it will always be comparatively easy to prevent\r\nher from coming in personal contact with vice and wickedness. The fact\r\nthat sin exists, and that great misery results from it, dawned gradually\r\nupon her mind as she understood more and more clearly the lives and\r\nexperiences of those around her. The necessity of laws and penalties had\r\nto be explained to her. She found it very hard to reconcile the presence\r\nof evil in the world with the idea of God which had been presented to\r\nher mind.\r\n\r\nOne day she asked, "Does God take care of us all the time?" She was\r\nanswered in the affirmative. "Then why did He let little sister fall\r\nthis morning, and hurt her head so badly?" Another time she was asking\r\nabout the power and goodness of God. She had been told of a terrible\r\nstorm at sea, in which several lives were lost, and she asked, "Why did\r\nnot God save the people if He can do all things?"\r\n\r\nSurrounded by loving friends and the gentlest influences, as Helen\r\nhad always been, she has, from the earliest stage of her intellectual\r\nenlightenment, willingly done right. She knows with unerring instinct\r\nwhat is right, and does it joyously. She does not think of one wrong\r\nact as harmless, of another as of no consequence, and of another as not\r\nintended. To her pure soul all evil is equally unlovely.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese passages from the paper Miss Sullivan prepared for the meeting at\r\nChautauqua, in July, 1894, of the American Association to Promote the\r\nTeaching of Speech to the Deaf, contain her latest written account of\r\nher methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou must not imagine that as soon as Helen grasped the idea that\r\neverything had a name she at once became mistress of the treasury of\r\nthe English language, or that "her mental faculties emerged, full armed,\r\nfrom their then living tomb, as Pallas Athene from the head of Zeus,"\r\nas one of her enthusiastic admirers would have us believe. At first, the\r\nwords, phrases and sentences which she used in expressing her thoughts\r\nwere all reproductions of what we had used in conversation with her, and\r\nwhich her memory had unconsciously retained. And indeed, this is true\r\nof the language of all children. Their language is the memory of the\r\nlanguage they hear spoken in their homes. Countless repetition of the\r\nconversation of daily life has impressed certain words and phrases upon\r\ntheir memories, and when they come to talk themselves, memory supplies\r\nthe words they lisp. Likewise, the language of educated people is the\r\nmemory of the language of books.\r\n\r\nLanguage grows out of life, out of its needs and experiences. At first\r\nmy little pupil\'s mind was all but vacant. She had been living in a\r\nworld she could not realize. LANGUAGE and KNOWLEDGE are indissolubly\r\nconnected; they are interdependent. Good work in language presupposes\r\nand depends on a real knowledge of things. As soon as Helen grasped\r\nthe idea that everything had a name, and that by means of the manual\r\nalphabet these names could be transmitted from one to another, I\r\nproceeded to awaken her further interest in the OBJECTS whose names she\r\nlearned to spell with such evident joy. I NEVER TAUGHT LANGUAGE FOR THE\r\nPURPOSE OF TEACHING IT; but invariably used language as a medium for the\r\ncommunication of THOUGHT; thus the learning of language was\r\nCOINCIDENT with the acquisition of knowledge. In order to use language\r\nintelligently, one must have something to talk ABOUT, and having\r\nsomething to talk about is the result of having had experiences; no\r\namount of language training will enable our little children to use\r\nlanguage with ease and fluency unless they have something clearly in\r\ntheir minds which they wish to communicate, or unless we succeed in\r\nawakening in them a desire to know what is in the minds of others.\r\n\r\nAt first I did not attempt to confine my pupil to any system. I\r\nalways tried to find out what interested her most, and made that the\r\nstarting-point for the new lesson, whether it had any bearing on the\r\nlesson I had planned to teach or not. During the first two years of her\r\nintellectual life, I required Helen to write very little. In order to\r\nwrite one must have something to write about, and having something to\r\nwrite about requires some mental preparation. The memory must be stored\r\nwith ideas and the mind must be enriched with knowledge before writing\r\nbecomes a natural and pleasurable effort. Too often, I think, children\r\nare required to write before they have anything to say. Teach them to\r\nthink and read and talk without self-repression, and they will write\r\nbecause they cannot help it.\r\n\r\nHelen acquired language by practice and habit rather than by study\r\nof rules and definitions. Grammar with its puzzling array of\r\nclassifications, nomenclatures, and paradigms, was wholly discarded in\r\nher education. She learned language by being brought in contact with\r\nthe LIVING language itself; she was made to deal with it in everyday\r\nconversation, and in her books, and to turn it over in a variety of ways\r\nuntil she was able to use it correctly. No doubt I talked much more with\r\nmy fingers, and more constantly than I should have done with my mouth;\r\nfor had she possessed the use of sight and hearing, she would have been\r\nless dependent on me for entertainment and instruction.\r\n\r\nI believe every child has hidden away somewhere in his being noble\r\ncapacities which may be quickened and developed if we go about it in the\r\nright way; but we shall never properly develop the higher natures of\r\nour little ones while we continue to fill their minds with the so-called\r\nrudiments. Mathematics will never make them loving, nor will the\r\naccurate knowledge of the size and shape of the world help them to\r\nappreciate its beauties. Let us lead them during the first years to find\r\ntheir greatest pleasure in Nature. Let them run in the fields, learn\r\nabout animals, and observe real things. Children will educate themselves\r\nunder right conditions. They require guidance and sympathy far more than\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nI think much of the fluency with which Helen uses language is due to the\r\nfact that nearly every impression which she receives comes through the\r\nmedium of language. But after due allowance has been made for Helen\'s\r\nnatural aptitude for acquiring language, and for the advantage resulting\r\nfrom her peculiar environment, I think that we shall still find that the\r\nconstant companionship of good books has been of supreme importance in\r\nher education. It may be true, as some maintain, that language cannot\r\nexpress to us much beyond what we have lived and experienced; but I\r\nhave always observed that children manifest the greatest delight in\r\nthe lofty, poetic language which we are too ready to think beyond their\r\ncomprehension. "This is all you will understand," said a teacher to a\r\nclass of little children, closing the book which she had been reading\r\nto them. "Oh, please read us the rest, even if we won\'t understand it,"\r\nthey pleaded, delighted with the rhythm, and the beauty which they felt,\r\neven though they could not have explained it. It is not necessary that\r\na child should understand every word in a book before he can read with\r\npleasure and profit. Indeed, only such explanations should be given as\r\nare really essential. Helen drank in language which she at first could\r\nnot understand, and it remained in her mind until needed, when it fitted\r\nitself naturally and easily into her conversation and compositions.\r\nIndeed, it is maintained by some that she reads too much, that a great\r\ndeal of originative force is dissipated in the enjoyment of books;\r\nthat when she might see and say things for herself, she sees them only\r\nthrough the eyes of others, and says them in their language, but I am\r\nconvinced that original composition without the preparation of much\r\nreading is an impossibility. Helen has had the best and purest models\r\nin language constantly presented to her, and her conversation and her\r\nwriting are unconscious reproductions of what she has read. Reading,\r\nI think, should be kept independent of the regular school exercises.\r\nChildren should be encouraged to read for the pure delight of it. The\r\nattitude of the child toward his books should be that of unconscious\r\nreceptivity. The great works of the imagination ought to become a part\r\nof his life, as they were once of the very substance of the men who\r\nwrote them. It is true, the more sensitive and imaginative the mind is\r\nthat receives the thought-pictures and images of literature, the more\r\nnicely the finest lines are reproduced. Helen has the vitality of\r\nfeeling, the freshness and eagerness of interest, and the spiritual\r\ninsight of the artistic temperament, and naturally she has a more active\r\nand intense joy in life, simply as life, and in nature, books, and\r\npeople than less gifted mortals. Her mind is so filled with the\r\nbeautiful thoughts and ideals of the great poets that nothing seems\r\ncommonplace to her; for her imagination colours all life with its own\r\nrich hues.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion of such of Miss Sullivan\'s statements and\r\nexplanations as have been published before. Too much has been written by\r\npeople who do not know the problems of the deaf at first hand, and I\r\ndo not care to add much to it. Miss Keller\'s education, however, is so\r\nfundamentally a question of language teaching that it rather includes\r\nthe problems of the deaf than limits itself to the deaf alone. Teachers\r\ncan draw their own conclusions. For the majority of readers, who will\r\nnot approach Miss Keller\'s life from the educator\'s point of view, I\r\nwill summarize a few principal things in Miss Sullivan\'s methods.\r\n\r\nMiss Sullivan has begun where Dr. Howe left off. He invented the\r\ninstrument, the physical means of working, but the teaching of language\r\nis quite another thing from the mechanical means by which language may\r\nbe taught. By experiment, by studying other children, Miss Sullivan came\r\nupon the practical way of teaching language by the natural method. It\r\nwas for this "natural method" that Dr. Howe was groping, but he never\r\ngot to this idea, that a deaf child should not be taught each word\r\nseparately by definition, but should be given language by endless\r\nrepetition of language which it does not understand. And this is\r\nMiss Sullivan\'s great discovery. All day long in their play-time and\r\nwork-time Miss Sullivan kept spelling into her pupil\'s hand, and by that\r\nHelen Keller absorbed words, just as the child in the cradle absorbs\r\nwords by hearing thousands of them before he uses one and by associating\r\nthe words with the occasion of their utterance. Thus he learns that\r\nwords name things and actions and feelings. Now, that is the first\r\nprinciple in Miss Sullivan\'s method, one that had practical results, and\r\none which, so far as I can discover, had never been put in practice in\r\nthe education of a deaf child, not to say a deaf-blind child, until Miss\r\nSullivan tried it with Helen Keller. And the principle had never been\r\nformulated clearly until Miss Sullivan wrote her letters.\r\n\r\nThe second principle in her method (the numerical order is, of course,\r\narbitrary) is never to talk to the child about things distasteful or\r\nwearisome to him. In the first deaf school Miss Sullivan ever visited,\r\nthe teacher was busy at the blackboard telling the children by written\r\nwords something they did not want to know, while they were crowding\r\nround their visitor with wide-awake curiosity, showing there were a\r\nthousand things they did want to know. Why not, says Miss Sullivan, make\r\na language lesson out of what they were interested in?\r\n\r\nAkin to this idea of talking to the child about what interests him, is\r\nthe principle never to silence a child who asks questions, but to\r\nanswer the questions as truly as possible; for, says Miss Sullivan, the\r\nquestion is the door to the child\'s mind. Miss Sullivan never needlessly\r\nbelittled her ideas or expressions to suit the supposed state of the\r\nchild\'s intelligence. She urged every one to speak to Helen naturally,\r\nto give her full sentences and intelligent ideas, never minding whether\r\nHelen understood or not. Thus Miss Sullivan knew what so many people\r\ndo not understand, that after the first rudimentary definitions of\r\nHAT, CUP, GO, SIT, the unit of language, as the child learns it, is the\r\nsentence, which is also the unit of language in our adult experience.\r\nWe do not take in a sentence word by word, but as a whole. It is the\r\nproposition, something predicated about something, that conveys an\r\nidea. True, single words do suggest and express ideas; the child may\r\nsay simply "mamma" when he means "Where is mamma?" but he learns the\r\nexpression of the ideas that relate to mamma--he learns language--by\r\nhearing complete sentences. And though Miss Sullivan did not force\r\ngrammatical completeness upon the first finger-lispings of her pupil,\r\nyet when she herself repeated Helen\'s sentence, "mamma milk," she filled\r\nout the construction, completed the child\'s ellipsis and said, "Mamma\r\nwill bring Helen some milk."\r\n\r\nThus Miss Sullivan was working out a natural method, which is so simple,\r\nso lacking in artificial system, that her method seems rather to be a\r\ndestruction of method. It is doubtful if we should have heard of Helen\r\nKeller if Miss Sullivan had not been where there were other children. By\r\nwatching them, she learned to treat her pupil as nearly as possible like\r\nan ordinary child.\r\n\r\nThe manual alphabet was not the only means of presenting words to Helen\r\nKeller\'s fingers. Books supplemented, perhaps equaled in importance the\r\nmanual alphabet, as a means of teaching language. Helen sat poring over\r\nthem before she could read, not at first for the story, but to find\r\nwords she knew; and the definition of new words which is implied in\r\ntheir context, in their position with reference to words known, added to\r\nHelen\'s vocabulary. Books are the storehouse of language, and any child,\r\nwhether deaf or not, if he has his attention attracted in any way to\r\nprinted pages, must learn. He learns not by reading what he understands,\r\nbut by reading and remembering words he does not understand. And though\r\nperhaps few children will have as much precocious interest in books as\r\ndid Helen Keller, yet the natural curiosity of every healthy child may\r\nbe turned to printed pages, especially if the teacher is clever and\r\nplays a word game as Miss Sullivan did. Helen Keller is supposed to\r\nhave a special aptitude for languages. It is true rather that she has a\r\nspecial aptitude for thinking, and her leaning toward language is due to\r\nthe fact that language to her meant life. It was not a special subject,\r\nlike geography or arithmetic, but her way to outward things.\r\n\r\nWhen at the age of fourteen she had had but a few lessons in German, she\r\nread over the words of "Wilhelm Tell" and managed to get the story.\r\nOf grammar she knew nothing and she cared nothing for it. She got the\r\nlanguage from the language itself, and this is, next to hearing the\r\nlanguage spoken, the way for any one to get a foreign tongue, more vital\r\nand, in the end, easier than our schoolroom method of beginning with the\r\ngrammar. In the same way she played with Latin, learning not only from\r\nthe lessons her first Latin teacher gave her, but from going over and\r\nover the words of a text, a game she played by herself.\r\n\r\nMr. John D. Wright, one of her teachers at the Wright-Humason School,\r\nsays in a letter to me:\r\n\r\n"Often I found her, when she had a little leisure, sitting in her\r\nfavourite corner, in a chair whose arms supported the big volume\r\nprepared for the blind, and passing her finger slowly over the lines of\r\nMoliere\'s \'Le Medecin Malgre Lui,\' chuckling to herself at the\r\ncomical situations and humorous lines. At that time her actual working\r\nvocabulary in French was very small, but by using her judgment, as we\r\nlaughingly called the mental process, she could guess at the meanings\r\nof the words and put the sense together much as a child puzzles out a\r\nsliced object. The result was that in a few weeks she and I spent a most\r\nhilarious hour one evening while she poured out to me the whole story,\r\ndwelling with great gusto on its humour and sparkling wit. It was not a\r\nlesson, but only one of her recreations."\r\n\r\nSo Helen Keller\'s aptitude for language is her whole mental aptitude,\r\nturned to language because of its extraordinary value to her.\r\n\r\nThere have been many discussions of the question whether Helen Keller\'s\r\nachievements are due to her natural ability or to the method by which\r\nshe was taught.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a teacher with ten times Miss Sullivan\'s genius could\r\nnot have made a pupil so remarkable as Helen Keller out of a child born\r\ndull and mentally deficient. But it is also true that, with ten times\r\nher native genius, Helen Keller could not have grown to what she is, if\r\nshe had not been excellently taught from the very start, and especially\r\nat the start. And the fact remains that she was taught by a method of\r\nteaching language to the deaf the essential principles of which are\r\nclearly expressed in Miss Sullivan\'s letters, written while she was\r\ndiscovering the method and putting it successfully into practice. And\r\nit can be applied by any teacher to any healthy deaf child, and in\r\nthe broadest interpretation of the principles, can be applied to the\r\nteaching of language of all kinds to all children.\r\n\r\nIn the many discussions of this question writers seem to throw us from\r\none horn to another of a dilemma--either a born genius in Helen Keller,\r\nor a perfect method in the teacher. Both things may be true at once, and\r\nthere is another truth which makes the dilemma imperfect. Miss Sullivan\r\nis a person of extraordinary power. Her method might not succeed so\r\ncompletely in the hands of any one else. Miss Sullivan\'s vigorous,\r\noriginal mind has lent much of its vitality to her pupil. If Miss Keller\r\nis fond of language and not interested especially in mathematics, it is\r\nnot surprising to find Miss Sullivan\'s interests very similar. And this\r\ndoes not mean that Miss Keller is unduly dependent on her teacher. It is\r\ntold of her that, as a child of eight, when some one tried to interfere\r\nwith her, she sat sober a few moments, and, when asked what was the\r\ntrouble, answered, "I am preparing to assert my independence." Such an\r\naggressive personality cannot grow up in mere dependence even under\r\nthe guidance of a will like Miss Sullivan\'s. But Miss Sullivan by her\r\n"natural aptitude" has done for her pupil much that is not capable of\r\nanalysis and reduction to principle; she has given the inspiration which\r\nis in all close friendship, and which rather develops than limits\r\nthe powers of either person. Moreover, if Miss Keller is a "marvel\r\nof sweetness and goodness," if she has a love "of all things good and\r\nbeautiful," this implies something about the teacher who has lived with\r\nher for sixteen years.\r\n\r\nThere is, then, a good deal that Miss Sullivan has done for Miss Keller\r\nwhich no other teacher can do in just the same way for any one else. To\r\nhave another Helen Keller there must be another Miss Sullivan. To have\r\nanother, well-educated deaf and blind child, there need only be another\r\nteacher, living under favourable conditions, among plenty of external\r\ninterests, unseparated from her pupil allowed to have a free hand, and\r\nusing as many as she needs of the principles which Miss Sullivan has\r\nsaved her the trouble of finding out for herself, modifying and adding\r\nas she finds it necessary; and there must be a pupil in good health, of\r\ngood native powers, young enough not to have grown beyond recovery in\r\nignorance. Any deaf child or deaf and blind child in good health can be\r\ntaught. And the one to do it is the parent or the special teacher, not\r\nthe school. I know that this idea will be vigorously combated by those\r\nwho conduct schools for the deaf. To be sure, the deaf school is the\r\nonly thing possible for children educated by the State. But it is\r\nevident that precisely what the deaf child needs to be taught is what\r\nother children learn before they go to school at all. When Miss Sullivan\r\nwent out in the barnyard and picked up a little chicken and talked to\r\nHelen about it, she was giving a kind of instruction impossible inside\r\nfour walls, and impossible with more than one pupil at a time.\r\n\r\nSurely Dr. Howe is wrong when he says, "A teacher cannot be a child."\r\nThat is just what the teacher of the deaf child must be, a child ready\r\nto play and romp, and interested in all childish things.\r\n\r\nThe temptation to discuss, solely in the light of Helen Keller, the\r\nwhole matter of educating the deaf is a dangerous one, and one which I\r\nhave not taken particular care to avoid, because my opinions are of no\r\nauthority and I have merely tried to suggest problems and reinforce some\r\nof the main ideas expressed by Miss Sullivan, who is an authority. It is\r\na question whether Helen Keller\'s success has not led teachers to expect\r\ntoo much of other children, and I know of deaf-blind children who are\r\ndragged along by their teachers and friends, and become the subjects of\r\nglowing reports, which are pathetically untrue, because one sees behind\r\nthe reports how the children are tugged at to bring them somewhere near\r\nthe exaggerated things that are said about them.\r\n\r\nLet me sum up a few of the elements that made Helen Keller what she\r\nis. In the first place she had nineteen months\' experience of sight and\r\nsound. This meant some mental development. She had inherited vigour of\r\nbody and mind. She expressed ideas in signs before she learned language.\r\nMrs. Keller writes me that before her illness Helen made signs for\r\neverything, and her mother thought this habit the cause of her slowness\r\nin learning to speak. After the illness, when they were dependent on\r\nsigns, Helen\'s tendency to gesture developed. How far she could receive\r\ncommunications is hard to determine, but she knew much that was going\r\non around her. She recognized that others used their lips; she "saw" her\r\nfather reading a paper and when he laid it down she sat in his chair\r\nand held the paper before her face. Her early rages were an unhappy\r\nexpression of the natural force of character which instruction was to\r\nturn into trained and organized power.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, to a good subject that Miss Sullivan brought her\r\ndevotion and intelligence, and fearless willingness to experiment. Miss\r\nSullivan\'s methods were so good that even without the practical result,\r\nany one would recognize the truth of the teacher\'s ideas. Miss Sullivan\r\nhas in addition a vigorous personality. And finally all the conditions\r\nwere good for that first nature school, in which the teacher and pupil\r\nplayed together, exploring together and educating themselves, pupil and\r\nteacher inseparable.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller\'s later education is easy to understand and needs no further\r\nexplanation than she has given. Those interested may get on application\r\nto the Volta Bureau, Washington, D. C., the reports of the teachers who\r\nprepared her for college, Mr. Arthur Gilman of the Cambridge School for\r\nYoung Ladies, and Mr. Merton S. Keith.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. SPEECH\r\n\r\nThe two persons who have written authoritatively about Miss Keller\'s\r\nspeech and the way she learned it are Miss Sarah Fuller, of the Horace\r\nMann School for the Deaf in Boston, Massachusetts, who gave her the\r\nfirst lessons, and Miss Sullivan, who, by her unremitting discipline,\r\ncarried on the success of these first lessons.\r\n\r\nBefore I quote from Miss Sullivan\'s account, let me try to give some\r\nimpression of what Miss Keller\'s speech and voice qualities are at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nHer voice is low and pleasant to listen to. Her speech lacks variety and\r\nmodulation; it runs in a sing-song when she is reading aloud; and when\r\nshe speaks with fair degree of loudness, it hovers about two or three\r\nmiddle tones. Her voice has an aspirate quality; there seems always to\r\nbe too much breath for the amount of tone. Some of her notes are musical\r\nand charming. When she is telling a child\'s story, or one with pathos in\r\nit, her voice runs into pretty slurs from one tone to another. This\r\nis like the effect of the slow dwelling on long words, not quite well\r\nmanaged, that one notices in a child who is telling a solemn story.\r\n\r\nThe principal thing that is lacking is sentence accent and variety\r\nin the inflection of phrases. Miss Keller pronounces each word as\r\na foreigner does when he is still labouring with the elements of a\r\nsentence, or as children sometimes read in school when they have to pick\r\nout each word.\r\n\r\nShe speaks French and German. Her friend, Mr. John Hitz, whose native\r\ntongue is German, says that her pronunciation is excellent. Another\r\nfriend, who is as familiar with French as with English, finds her French\r\nmuch more intelligible than her English. When she speaks English she\r\ndistributes her emphasis as in French and so does not put sufficient\r\nstress on accented syllables. She says for example, "pro-vo-ca-tion,"\r\n"in-di-vi-du-al," with ever so little difference between the value of\r\nsyllables, and a good deal of inconsistency in the pronunciation of the\r\nsame word one day and the next. It would, I think, be hard to make her\r\nfeel just how to pronounce DICTIONARY without her erring either toward\r\nDICTIONAYRY or DICTION\'RY, and, of course the word is neither one nor\r\nthe other. For no system of marks in a lexicon can tell one how to\r\npronounce a word. The only way is to hear it, especially in a language\r\nlike English which is so full of unspellable, suppressed vowels and\r\nquasi-vowels.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller\'s vowels are not firm. Her AWFUL is nearly AWFIL. The\r\nwavering is caused by the absence of accent on FUL, for she pronounces\r\nFULL correctly.\r\n\r\nShe sometimes mispronounces as she reads aloud and comes on a word which\r\nshe happens never to have uttered, though she may have written it many\r\ntimes. This difficulty and some others may be corrected when she and\r\nMiss Sullivan have more time. Since 1894, they have been so much in\r\ntheir books that they have neglected everything that was not necessary\r\nto the immediate task of passing the school years successfully. Miss\r\nKeller will never be able, I believe, to speak loud without destroying\r\nthe pleasant quality and the distinctness of her words, but she can do\r\nmuch to make her speech clearer.\r\n\r\nWhen she was at the Wright-Humason School in New York, Dr. Humason tried\r\nto improve her voice, not only her word pronunciation, but the voice\r\nitself, and gave her lessons in tone and vocal exercises.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say whether or not Miss Keller\'s speech is easy to\r\nunderstand. Some understand her readily; others do not. Her friends grow\r\naccustomed to her speech and forget that it is different from that of\r\nany one else. Children seldom have any difficulty in understanding\r\nher; which suggests that her deliberate measured speech is like theirs,\r\nbefore they come to the adult trick of running all the words of a phrase\r\ninto one movement of the breath. I am told that Miss Keller speaks\r\nbetter than most other deaf people.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller has told how she learned to speak. Miss Sullivan\'s account\r\nin her address at Chautauqua, in July, 1894, at the meeting of The\r\nAmerican Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, is\r\nsubstantially like Miss Keller\'s in points of fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS SULLIVAN\'S ACCOUNT OF MISS KELLER\'S SPEECH\r\n\r\nIt was three years from the time when Helen began to communicate by\r\nmeans of the manual alphabet that she received her first lesson in the\r\nmore natural and universal medium of human intercourse--oral language.\r\nShe had become very proficient in the use of the manual alphabet, which\r\nwas her only means of communication with the outside world; through it\r\nshe had acquired a vocabulary which enabled her to converse freely,\r\nread intelligently, and write with comparative ease and correctness.\r\nNevertheless, the impulse to utter audible sounds was strong within\r\nher, and the constant efforts which I made to repress this instinctive\r\ntendency, which I feared in time would become unpleasant, were of no\r\navail. I made no effort to teach her to speak, because I regarded her\r\ninability to watch the lips of others as an insurmountable obstacle.\r\nBut she gradually became conscious that her way of communicating was\r\ndifferent from that used by those around her, and one day her thoughts\r\nfound expression. "How do the blind girls know what to say with their\r\nmouths? Why do you not teach me to talk like them? Do deaf children ever\r\nlearn to speak?" I explained to her that some deaf children were taught\r\nto speak, but that they could see their teachers\' mouths, and that that\r\nwas a very great assistance to them. But she interrupted me to say\r\nshe was very sure she could feel my mouth very well. Soon after this\r\nconversation, a lady came to see her and told her about the deaf and\r\nblind Norwegian child, Ragnhild Kaata, who had been taught to speak and\r\nunderstand what her teacher said to her by touching his lips with her\r\nfingers. She at once resolved to learn to speak, and from that day to\r\nthis she has never wavered in that resolution. She began immediately\r\nto make sounds which she called speaking, and I saw the necessity of\r\ncorrect instruction, since her heart was set upon learning to talk; and,\r\nfeeling my own incompetence to teach her, never having given the subject\r\nof articulation serious study, I went with my pupil for advice and\r\nassistance, to Miss Sarah Fuller. Miss Fuller was delighted with Helen\'s\r\nearnestness and enthusiasm, and at once began to teach her. In a few\r\nlessons she learned nearly all of the English sounds, and in less than a\r\nmonth she was able to articulate a great many words distinctly. From\r\nthe first she was not content to be drilled in single sounds, but was\r\nimpatient to pronounce words and sentences. The length of the word\r\nor the difficulty of the arrangement of the elements never seemed to\r\ndiscourage her. But, with all her eagerness and intelligence, learning\r\nto speak taxed her powers to the utmost. But there was satisfaction\r\nin seeing from day to day the evidence of growing mastery and the\r\npossibility of final success. And Helen\'s success has been more complete\r\nand inspiring than any of her friends expected, and the child\'s delight\r\nin being able to utter her thoughts in living and distinct speech is\r\nshared by all who witness her pleasure when strangers tell her that they\r\nunderstand her.\r\n\r\nI have been asked a great many times whether I think Helen will ever\r\nspeak naturally; that is, as other people speak. I am hardly prepared\r\nto decide that question, or even give an opinion regarding it. I believe\r\nthat I have hardly begun yet to know what is possible. Teachers of the\r\ndeaf often express surprise that Helen\'s speech is so good when she\r\nhas not received any regular instruction in speech since the first few\r\nlessons given her by Miss Fuller. I can only say in reply, "This is\r\ndue to habitual imitation and practice! practice! practice!" Nature has\r\ndetermined how the child shall learn to speak, and all we can do is to\r\naid him in the simplest, easiest way possible, by encouraging him to\r\nobserve and imitate the vibrations in the voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome further details appear in an earlier, more detailed account, which\r\nMiss Sullivan wrote for the Perkins Institution Report of 1891.\r\n\r\nI knew that Laura Bridgman had shown the same intuitive desire to\r\nproduce sounds, and had even learned to pronounce a few simple words,\r\nwhich she took great delight in using, and I did not doubt that Helen\r\ncould accomplish as much as this. I thought, however, that the advantage\r\nshe would derive would not repay her for the time and labour that such\r\nan experiment would cost.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the absence of hearing renders the voice monotonous and often\r\nvery disagreeable; and such speech is generally unintelligible except to\r\nthose familiar with the speaker.\r\n\r\nThe acquiring of speech by untaught deaf children is always slow and\r\noften painful. Too much stress, it seems to me, is often laid upon the\r\nimportance of teaching a deaf child to articulate--a process which may\r\nbe detrimental to the pupil\'s intellectual development. In the very\r\nnature of things, articulation is an unsatisfactory means of education;\r\nwhile the use of the manual alphabet quickens and invigorates mental\r\nactivity, since through it the deaf child is brought into close contact\r\nwith the English language, and the highest and most abstract ideas may\r\nbe conveyed to the mind readily and accurately. Helen\'s case proved it\r\nto be also an invaluable aid in acquiring articulation. She was already\r\nperfectly familiar with words and the construction of sentences, and\r\nhad only mechanical difficulties to overcome. Moreover, she knew what a\r\npleasure speech would be to her, and this definite knowledge of what\r\nshe was striving for gave her the delight of anticipation which made\r\ndrudgery easy. The untaught deaf child who is made to articulate does\r\nnot know what the goal is, and his lessons in speech are for a long time\r\ntedious and meaningless.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the process of teaching Helen to speak, it may be well\r\nto state briefly to what extent she had used the vocal organs before\r\nshe began to receive regular instruction in articulation. When she was\r\nstricken down with the illness which resulted in her loss of sight and\r\nhearing, at the age of nineteen months, she was learning to talk. The\r\nunmeaning babblings of the infant were becoming day by day conscious and\r\nvoluntary signs of what she felt and thought. But the disease checked\r\nher progress in the acquisition of oral language, and, when her\r\nphysical strength returned, it was found that she had ceased to speak\r\nintelligibly because she could no longer hear a sound. She continued\r\nto exercise her vocal organs mechanically, as ordinary children do. Her\r\ncries and laughter and the tones of her voice as she pronounced many\r\nword elements were perfectly natural, but the child evidently attached\r\nno significance to them, and with one exception they were produced not\r\nwith any intention of communicating with those around her, but from\r\nthe sheer necessity of exercising her innate, organic, and hereditary\r\nfaculty of expression. She always attached a meaning to the word water,\r\nwhich was one of the first sounds her baby lips learned to form, and it\r\nwas the only word which she continued to articulate after she lost her\r\nhearing. Her pronunciation of this gradually became indistinct, and\r\nwhen I first knew her it was nothing more than a peculiar noise.\r\nNevertheless, it was the only sign she ever made for water, and not\r\nuntil she had learned to spell the word with her fingers did she forget\r\nthe spoken symbol. The word water, and the gesture which corresponds to\r\nthe word good-by,seem to have been all that the child remembered of the\r\nnatural and acquired signs with which she had been familiar before her\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nAs she became acquainted with her surroundings through the sense of\r\nfeeling (I use the word in the broadest sense, as including all\r\ntactile impressions), she felt more and more the pressing necessity of\r\ncommunicating with those around her. Her little hands felt every object\r\nand observed every movement of the persons about her, and she was\r\nquick to imitate these movements. She was thus able to express her more\r\nimperative needs and many of her thoughts.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I became her teacher, she had made for herself upward\r\nof sixty signs, all of which were imitative and were readily understood\r\nby those who knew her. The only signs which I think she may have\r\ninvented were her signs for SMALL and LARGE. Whenever she wished for\r\nanything very much she would gesticulate in a very expressive manner.\r\nFailing to make herself understood, she would become violent. In the\r\nyears of her mental imprisonment she depended entirely upon signs, and\r\nshe did not work out for herself any sort of articulate language capable\r\nof expressing ideas. It seems, however, that, while she was still\r\nsuffering from severe pain, she noticed the movements of her mother\'s\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nWhen she was not occupied, she wandered restlessly about the house,\r\nmaking strange though rarely unpleasant sounds. I have seen her rock\r\nher doll, making a continuous, monotonous sound, keeping one hand on her\r\nthroat, while the fingers of the other hand noted the movements of\r\nher lips. This was in imitation of her mother\'s crooning to the baby.\r\nOccasionally she broke out into a merry laugh, and then she would reach\r\nout and touch the mouth of any one who happened to be near her, to see\r\nif he were laughing also. If she detected no smile, she gesticulated\r\nexcitedly, trying to convey her thought; but if she failed to make her\r\ncompanion laugh, she sat still for a few moments, with a troubled and\r\ndisappointed expression. She was pleased with anything which made a\r\nnoise. She liked to feel the cat purr; and if by chance she felt a dog\r\nin the act of barking, she showed great pleasure. She always liked to\r\nstand by the piano when some one was playing and singing. She kept one\r\nhand on the singer\'s mouth, while the other rested on the piano, and\r\nshe stood in this position as long as any one would sing to her, and\r\nafterward she would make a continuous sound which she called singing.\r\nThe only words she had learned to pronounce with any degree of\r\ndistinctness previous to March, 1890, were PAPA, MAMMA, BABY, SISTER.\r\nThese words she had caught without instruction from the lips of\r\nfriends. It will be seen that they contain three vowel and six consonant\r\nelements, and these formed the foundation for her first real lesson in\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first lesson she was able to pronounce distinctly the\r\nfollowing sounds: a, a", a^, e, i, o, c soft like s and hard like k,\r\ng hard, b, l, n, m, t, p, s, u, k, f and d. Hard consonants were, and\r\nindeed still are, very difficult for her to pronounce in connection with\r\none another in the same word; she often suppresses the one and changes\r\nthe other, and sometimes she replaces both by an analogous sound with\r\nsoft aspiration. The confusion between l and r was very noticeable in\r\nher speech at first. She would repeatedly use one for the other. The\r\ngreat difficulty in the pronunciation of the r made it one of the last\r\nelements which she mastered. The ch, sh and soft g also gave her much\r\ntrouble, and she does not yet enunciate them clearly. [The difficulties\r\nwhich Miss Sullivan found in 1891 are, in a measure, the difficulties\r\nwhich show in Miss Keller\'s speech today.]\r\n\r\nWhen she had been talking for less than a week, she met her friend, Mr.\r\nRodocanachi, and immediately began to struggle with the pronunciation of\r\nhis name; nor would she give it up until she was able to articulate the\r\nword distinctly. Her interest never diminished for a moment; and, in her\r\neagerness to overcome the difficulties which beset her on all sides, she\r\ntaxed her powers to the utmost, and learned in eleven lessons all of the\r\nseparate elements of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough appears in the accounts by Miss Keller\'s teacher to show the\r\nprocess by which she reads the lips with her fingers, the process by\r\nwhich she was taught to speak, and by which, of course, she can listen\r\nto conversation now. In reading the lips she is not so quick or so\r\naccurate as some reports declare. It is a clumsy and unsatisfactory way\r\nof receiving communication, useless when Miss Sullivan or some one else\r\nwho knows the manual alphabet is present to give Miss Keller the spoken\r\nwords of others. Indeed, when some friend is trying to speak to Miss\r\nKeller, and the attempt is not proving successful, Miss Sullivan usually\r\nhelps by spelling the lost words into Miss Keller\'s hand.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt had little difficulty last spring in making Miss\r\nKeller understand him, and especially requested Miss Sullivan not to\r\nspell into her hand. She got every word, for the President\'s speech is\r\nnotably distinct. Other people say they have no success in making Miss\r\nKeller "hear" them.\r\n\r\nA few friends to whom she is accustomed, like Mrs. A. C. Pratt, and Mr.\r\nJ. E. Chamberlin, can pass a whole day with her and tell her everything\r\nwithout the manual alphabet. The ability to read the lips helps Miss\r\nKeller in getting corrections of her pronunciation from Miss Sullivan\r\nand others, just as it was the means of her learning to speak at all,\r\nbut it is rather an accomplishment than a necessity.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that speech contributed in no way to her\r\nfundamental education, though without the ability to speak she could\r\nhardly have gone to higher schools and to college. But she knows better\r\nthan any one else what value speech has had for her. The following is\r\nher address at the fifth meeting of the American Association to\r\nPromote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, at Mt. Airy, Philadelphia,\r\nPennsylvania, July 8, 1896:\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF HELEN KELLER AT MT. AIRY\r\n\r\nIf you knew all the joy I feel in being able to speak to you to-day, I\r\nthink you would have some idea of the value of speech to the deaf, and\r\nyou would understand why I want every little deaf child in all this\r\ngreat world to have an opportunity to learn to speak. I know that much\r\nhas been said and written on this subject, and that there is a wide\r\ndifference of opinion among teachers of the deaf in regard to oral\r\ninstruction. It seems very strange to me that there should be this\r\ndifference of opinion; I cannot understand how any one interested in our\r\neducation can fail to appreciate the satisfaction we feel in being able\r\nto express our thoughts in living words. Why, I use speech constantly,\r\nand I cannot begin to tell you how much pleasure it gives me to do so.\r\nOf course I know that it is not always easy for strangers to understand\r\nme, but it will be by and by; and in the meantime I have the unspeakable\r\nhappiness of knowing that my family and friends rejoice in my ability\r\nto speak. My little sister and baby brother love to have me tell them\r\nstories in the long summer evenings when I am at home; and my mother\r\nand teacher often ask me to read to them from my favourite books. I also\r\ndiscuss the political situation with my dear father, and we decide the\r\nmost perplexing questions quite as satisfactorily to ourselves as if\r\nI could see and hear. So you see what a blessing speech is to me. It\r\nbrings me into closer and tenderer relationship with those I love, and\r\nmakes it possible for me to enjoy the sweet companionship of a great\r\nmany persons from whom I should be entirely cut off if I could not talk.\r\n\r\nI can remember the time before I learned to speak, and how I used to\r\nstruggle to express my thoughts by means of the manual alphabet--how my\r\nthoughts used to beat against my finger tips like little birds striving\r\nto gain their freedom, until one day Miss Fuller opened wide the\r\nprison-door and let them escape. I wonder if she remembers how eagerly\r\nand gladly they spread their wings and flew away. Of course, it was not\r\neasy at first to fly. The speech-wings were weak and broken, and had\r\nlost all the grace and beauty that had once been theirs; indeed, nothing\r\nwas left save the impulse to fly, but that was something. One can never\r\nconsent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar. But, nevertheless,\r\nit seemed to me sometimes that I could never use my speech-wings as God\r\nintended I should use them; there were so many difficulties in the way,\r\nso many discouragements; but I kept on trying, knowing that patience and\r\nperseverance would win in the end. And while I worked, I built the most\r\nbeautiful air-castles, and dreamed dreams, the pleasantest of which was\r\nof the time when I should talk like other people, and the thought of the\r\npleasure it would give my mother to hear my voice once more, sweetened\r\nevery effort and made every failure an incentive to try harder next\r\ntime. So I want to say to those who are trying to learn to speak and\r\nthose who are teaching them: Be of good cheer. Do not think of to-days\r\nfailures, but of the success that may come to-morrow. You have set\r\nyourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere,\r\nand you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles--a delight in climbing\r\nrugged paths, which you would perhaps never know if you did not sometime\r\nslip backward--if the road was always smooth and pleasant. Remember,\r\nno effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost.\r\nSometime, somewhere, somehow we shall find that which we seek. We shall\r\nspeak, yes, and sing, too, as God intended we should speak and sing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. LITERARY STYLE\r\n\r\nNo one can have read Miss Keller\'s autobiography without feeling that\r\nshe writes unusually fine English. Any teacher of composition knows that\r\nhe can bring his pupils to the point of writing without errors in syntax\r\nor in the choice of words. It is just this accuracy which Miss Keller\'s\r\nearly education fixes as the point to which any healthy child can be\r\nbrought, and which the analysis of that education accounts for. Those\r\nwho try to make her an exception not to be explained by any such\r\nanalysis of her early education, fortify their position by an appeal\r\nto the remarkable excellence of her use of language even when she was a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThis appeal is to a certain degree valid; for, indeed, those additional\r\nharmonies of language and beauties of thought which make style are the\r\ngifts of the gods. No teacher could have made Helen Keller sensitive\r\nto the beauties of language and to the finer interplay of thought which\r\ndemands expression in melodious word groupings.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the inborn gift of style can be starved or stimulated.\r\nNo innate genius can invent fine language. The stuff of which good style\r\nis made must be given to the mind from without and given skilfully. A\r\nchild of the muses cannot write fine English unless fine English has\r\nbeen its nourishment. In this, as in all other things, Miss Sullivan has\r\nbeen the wise teacher. If she had not had taste and an enthusiasm for\r\ngood English, Helen Keller might have been brought up on the "Juvenile\r\nLiterature," which belittles the language under pretense of being simply\r\nphrased for children; as if a child\'s book could not, like "Treasure\r\nIsland" or "Robinson Crusoe" or the "Jungle Book," be in good style.\r\n\r\nIf Miss Sullivan wrote fine English, the beauty of Helen Keller\'s\r\nstyle would, in part, be explicable at once. But the extracts from Miss\r\nSullivan\'s letters and from her reports, although they are clear and\r\naccurate, have not the beauty which distinguishes Miss Keller\'s English.\r\nHer service as a teacher of English is not to be measured by her own\r\nskill in composition. The reason why she read to her pupil so many good\r\nbooks is due, in some measure, to the fact that she had so recently\r\nrecovered her eyesight. When she became Helen Keller\'s teacher she was\r\njust awakening to the good things that are in books, from which she had\r\nbeen shut out during her years of blindness.\r\n\r\nIn Captain Keller\'s library she found excellent books, Lamb\'s "Tales\r\nfrom Shakespeare," and better still Montaigne. After the first year or\r\nso of elementary work she met her pupil on equal terms, and they read\r\nand enjoyed good books together.\r\n\r\nBesides the selection of good books, there is one other cause for\r\nMiss Keller\'s excellence in writing, for which Miss Sullivan deserves\r\nunlimited credit. That is her tireless and unrelenting discipline, which\r\nis evident in all her work. She never allowed her pupil to send off\r\nletters which contained offenses against taste, but made her write them\r\nover until they were not only correct, but charming and well phrased.\r\n\r\nAny one who has tried to write knows what Miss Keller owes to the\r\nendless practice which Miss Sullivan demanded of her. Let a teacher with\r\na liking for good style insist on a child\'s writing a paragraph over and\r\nover again until it is more than correct, and he will be training,\r\neven beyond his own power of expression, the power of expression in the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nHow far Miss Sullivan carried this process of refinement and selection\r\nis evident from the humorous comment of Dr. Bell, that she made her\r\npupil a little old woman, too widely different from ordinary children in\r\nher maturity of thought. When Dr. Bell said this he was arguing his own\r\ncase. For it was Dr. Bell who first saw the principles that underlie\r\nMiss Sullivan\'s method, and explained the process by which Helen Keller\r\nabsorbed language from books.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, a reason why Helen Keller writes good English, which\r\nlies in the very absence of sight and hearing. The disadvantages of\r\nbeing deaf and blind were overcome and the advantages remained. She\r\nexcels other deaf people because she was taught as if she were normal.\r\nOn the other hand, the peculiar value to her of language, which ordinary\r\npeople take for granted as a necessary part of them like their right\r\nhand, made her think about language and love it. Language was her\r\nliberator, and from the first she cherished it.\r\n\r\nThe proof of Miss Keller\'s early skill in the use of English, and the\r\nfinal comment on the excellence of this whole method of teaching,\r\nis contained in an incident, which, although at the time it seemed\r\nunfortunate, can no longer be regretted. I refer to the "Frost King"\r\nepisode, which I shall explain in detail. Miss Keller has given her\r\naccount of it, and the whole matter was discussed in the first Volta\r\nBureau Souvenir from which I quote at length:\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS SULLIVAN\'S ACCOUNT OF THE "FROST KING"\r\n\r\nHON. JOHN HITZ, Superintendent of the Volta Bureau, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: Since my paper was prepared for the second edition of the\r\nSouvenir "Helen Keller," some facts have been brought to my notice which\r\nare of interest in connection with the subject of the acquisition of\r\nlanguage by my pupil, and if it is not already too late for publication\r\nin this issue of the Souvenir, I shall be glad if I may have opportunity\r\nto explain them in detail.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be remembered that in my paper*, where allusion is made\r\nto Helen\'s remarkable memory, it is noted that she appears to retain in\r\nher mind many forms of expression which, at the time they are received,\r\nshe probably does not understand; but when further information is\r\nacquired, the language retained in her memory finds full or partial\r\nexpression in her conversation or writing, according as it proves of\r\ngreater or less value to her in the fitness of its application to the\r\nnew experience. Doubtless this is true in the case of every intelligent\r\nchild, and should not, perhaps, be considered worthy of especial mention\r\nin Helen\'s case, but for the fact that a child who is deprived of\r\nthe senses of sight and hearing might not be expected to be as gifted\r\nmentally as this little girl proves to be; hence it is quite possible\r\nwe may be inclined to class as marvelous many things we discover in the\r\ndevelopment of her mind which do not merit such an explanation.\r\n\r\n* In this paper Miss Sullivan says: "During this winter (1891-92) I went\r\nwith her into the yard while a light snow was falling, and let her feel\r\nthe falling flakes. She appeared to enjoy it very much indeed. As\r\nwe went in she repeated these words, \'Out of the cloud-folds of his\r\ngarments Winter shakes the snow.\' I inquired of her where she had read\r\nthis; she did not remember having read it, did not seem to know that\r\nshe had learned it. As I had never heard it, I inquired of several of\r\nmy friends if they recalled the words; no one seemed to remember it. The\r\nteachers at the Institution expressed the opinion that the description\r\ndid not appear in any book in raised print in that library; but one\r\nlady, Miss Marrett, took upon herself the task of examining books of\r\npoems in ordinary type, and was rewarded by finding the following lines\r\nin one of Longfellow\'s minor poems, entitled \'Snowflakes\':\r\n\r\n\'Out of the bosom of the air, Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,\r\nOver the woodlands brown and bare, Over the harvest-fields forsaken,\r\nSilent, and soft, and slow Descends the snow.\'\r\n\r\n"It would seem that Helen had learned and treasured the memory of this\r\nexpression of the poet, and this morning in the snow-storm had found its\r\napplication."\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hope that I may be pardoned if I appear to overestimate the\r\nremarkable mental capacity and power of comprehension and discrimination\r\nwhich my pupil possesses, I wish to add that, while I have always known\r\nthat Helen made great use of such descriptions and comparisons as appeal\r\nto her imagination and fine poetic nature, yet recent developments in\r\nher writings convince me of the fact that I have not in the past been\r\nfully aware to what extent she absorbs the language of her favourite\r\nauthors. In the early part of her education I had full knowledge of all\r\nthe books she read and of nearly all the stories which were read to her,\r\nand could without difficulty trace the source of any adaptations noted\r\nin her writing or conversation; and I have always been much pleased to\r\nobserve how appropriately she applies the expressions of a favourite\r\nauthor in her own compositions.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from a few of her published letters give evidence\r\nof how valuable this power of retaining the memory of beautiful language\r\nhas been to her. One warm, sunny day in early spring, when we were at\r\nthe North, the balmy atmosphere appears to have brought to her mind the\r\nsentiment expressed by Longfellow in "Hiawatha," and she almost sings\r\nwith the poet: "The ground was all aquiver with the stir of new life. My\r\nheart sang for very joy. I thought of my own dear home. I knew that in\r\nthat sunny land spring had come in all its splendour. \'All its birds and\r\nall its blossoms, all its flowers and all its grasses.\'"\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, in a letter to a friend, in which she makes mention\r\nof her Southern home, she gives so close a reproduction from a poem\r\nby one of her favourite authors that I will give extracts from Helen\'s\r\nletter and from the poem itself:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM HELEN\'S LETTER\r\n\r\n[The entire letter is published on pp. 245 and 246 of the Report of the\r\nPerkins Institution for 1891]\r\n\r\nThe blue-bird with his azure plumes, the thrush clad all in brown, the\r\nrobin jerking his spasmodic throat, the oriole drifting like a flake of\r\nfire, the jolly bobolink and his happy mate, the mocking-bird imitating\r\nthe notes of all, the red-bird with his one sweet trill, and the busy\r\nlittle wren, are all making the trees in our front yard ring with their\r\nglad song.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE POEM ENTITLED "SPRING" BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES\r\n\r\nThe bluebird, breathing from his azure plumes The fragrance borrowed\r\nfrom the myrtle blooms; The thrush, poor wanderer, dropping meekly down,\r\nClad in his remnant of autumnal brown; The oriole, drifting like a flake\r\nof fire Rent by a whirlwind from a blazing spire; The robin, jerking\r\nhis spasmodic throat, Repeats imperious, his staccato note; The\r\ncrack-brained bobolink courts his crazy mate, Poised on a bullrush tipsy\r\nwith his weight: Nay, in his cage the lone canary sings, Feels the soft\r\nair, and spreads his idle wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day of April she uses another expression from the same poem,\r\nwhich is more an adaptation than a reproduction: "To-morrow April will\r\nhide her tears and blushes beneath the flowers of lovely May."\r\n\r\nIn a letter to a friend at the Perkins Institution, dated May 17, 1889,\r\nshe gives a reproduction from one of Hans Christian Andersen\'s stories,\r\nwhich I had read to her not long before. This letter is published in the\r\nPerkins Institution Report (1891), p. 204. The original story was read\r\nto her from a copy of "Andersen\'s Stories," published by Leavitt & Allen\r\nBros., and may be found on p. 97 of Part I. in that volume.\r\n\r\nHer admiration for the impressive explanations which Bishop Brooks has\r\ngiven her of the Fatherhood of God is well known. In one of his letters,\r\nspeaking of how God in every way tells us of His love, he says, "I think\r\nhe writes it even upon the walls of the great house of nature which we\r\nlive in, that he is our Father." The next year at Andover she said: "It\r\nseems to me the world is full of goodness, beauty, and love; and how\r\ngrateful we must be to our heavenly Father, who has given us so much to\r\nenjoy! His love and care are written all over the walls of nature."\r\n\r\nIn these later years, since Helen has come in contact with so many\r\npersons who are able to converse freely with her, she has made the\r\nacquaintance of some literature with which I am not familiar; she has\r\nalso found in books printed in raised letters, in the reading of which I\r\nhave been unable to follow her, much material for the cultivation of\r\nthe taste she possesses for poetical imagery. The pages of the book she\r\nreads become to her like paintings, to which her imaginative powers give\r\nlife and colour. She is at once transported into the midst of the events\r\nportrayed in the story she reads or is told, and the characters and\r\ndescriptions become real to her; she rejoices when justice wins, and is\r\nsad when virtue goes unrewarded. The pictures the language paints on her\r\nmemory appear to make an indelible impression; and many times, when an\r\nexperience comes to her similar in character, the language starts forth\r\nwith wonderful accuracy, like the reflection from a mirror.\r\n\r\nHelen\'s mind is so gifted by nature that she seems able to understand\r\nwith only the faintest touch of explanation every possible variety\r\nof external relations. One day in Alabama, as we were gathering wild\r\nflowers near the springs on the hillsides, she seemed to understand for\r\nthe first time that the springs were surrounded by mountains, and she\r\nexclaimed: "The mountains are crowding around the springs to look at\r\ntheir own beautiful reflections!" I do not know where she obtained this\r\nlanguage, yet it is evident that it must have come to her from without,\r\nas it would hardly be possible for a person deprived of the visual sense\r\nto originate such an idea. In mentioning a visit to Lexington, Mass.,\r\nshe writes: "As we rode along we could see the forest monarchs bend\r\ntheir proud forms to listen to the little children of the woodlands\r\nwhispering their secrets. The anemone, the wild violet, the hepatica,\r\nand the funny little curled-up ferns all peeped out at us from beneath\r\nthe brown leaves." She closes this letter with, "I must go to bed, for\r\nMorpheus has touched my eyelids with his golden wand." Here again, I am\r\nunable to state where she acquired these expressions.\r\n\r\nShe has always seemed to prefer stories which exercise the imagination,\r\nand catches and retains the poetic spirit in all such literature; but\r\nnot until this winter have I been conscious that her memory absorbed the\r\nexact language to such an extent that she is herself unable to trace the\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThis is shown in a little story she wrote in October last at the home of\r\nher parents in Tuscumbia, which she called "Autumn Leaves." She was\r\nat work upon it about two weeks, writing a little each day, at her\r\nown pleasure. When it was finished, and we read it in the family, it\r\noccasioned much comment on account of the beautiful imagery, and we\r\ncould not understand how Helen could describe such pictures without the\r\naid of sight. As we had never seen or heard of any such story as this\r\nbefore, we inquired of her where she read it; she replied, "I did\r\nnot read it; it is my story for Mr. Anagnos\'s birthday." While I was\r\nsurprised that she could write like this, I was not more astonished than\r\nI had been many times before at the unexpected achievements of my little\r\npupil, especially as we had exchanged many beautiful thoughts on the\r\nsubject of the glory of the ripening foliage during the autumn of this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nBefore Helen made her final copy of the story, it was suggested to her\r\nto change its title to "The Frost King," as more appropriate to the\r\nsubject of which the story treated; to this she willingly assented. The\r\nstory was written by Helen in braille, as usual and copied by her in\r\nthe same manner, I then interlined the manuscript for the greater\r\nconvenience of those who desired to read it. Helen wrote a little\r\nletter, and, enclosing the manuscript, forwarded both by mail to Mr.\r\nAnagnos for his birthday.\r\n\r\nThe story was printed in the January number of the Mentor and, from a\r\nreview of it in the Goodson Gazette, I was startled to find that a very\r\nsimilar story had been published in 1873, seven years before Helen was\r\nborn. This story, "Frost Fairies," appeared in a book written by Miss\r\nMargaret T. Canby, entitled "Birdie and his Fairy Friends." The passages\r\nquoted from the two stories were so much alike in thought and expression\r\nas to convince me that Miss Canby\'s story must at some time have been\r\nread to Helen.\r\n\r\nAs I had never read this story, or even heard of the book, I inquired of\r\nHelen if she knew anything about the matter, and found she did not. She\r\nwas utterly unable to recall either the name of the story or the book.\r\nCareful examination was made of the books in raised print in the library\r\nof the Perkins Institution to learn if any extracts from this volume\r\ncould be found there; but nothing was discovered. I then concluded that\r\nthe story must have been read to her a long time ago, as her memory\r\nusually retains with great distinctness facts and impressions which have\r\nbeen committed to its keeping.\r\n\r\nAfter making careful inquiry, I succeeded in obtaining the information\r\nthat our friend, Mrs. S. C. Hopkins, had a copy of this book in 1888\r\nwhich was presented to her little daughter in 1873 or 1874. Helen and\r\nI spent the summer of 1888 with Mrs. Hopkins at her home in Brewster,\r\nMass., where she kindly relieved me a part of the time, of the care\r\nof Helen. She amused and entertained Helen by reading to her from a\r\ncollection of juvenile publications, among which was the copy of "Birdie\r\nand his Fairy Friends"; and, while Mrs. Hopkins does not remember\r\nthis story of "Frost Fairies," she is confident that she read to Helen\r\nextracts, if not entire stories, from this volume. But as she was not\r\nable to find her copy, and applications for the volume at bookstores in\r\nBoston, New York, Philadelphia, Albany, and other places resulted only\r\nin failure, search was instituted for the author herself. This became\r\na difficult task, as her publishers in Philadelphia had retired from\r\nbusiness many years ago; however, it was eventually discovered that her\r\nresidence is at Wilmington, Delaware, and copies of the second edition\r\nof the book, 1889, were obtained from her. She has since secured and\r\nforwarded to me a copy of the first edition.\r\n\r\nThe most generous and gratifying letters have been received from Miss\r\nCanby by Helen\'s friends, a few extracts from which are given:\r\n\r\nUnder date of February 24, 1892, after mentioning the order of the\r\npublication of the stories in the magazine, she writes:\r\n\r\n"All the stories were revised before publishing them in book form;\r\nadditions were made to the number as first published, I think, and some\r\nof the titles may have been changed."\r\n\r\nIn the same letter she writes:\r\n\r\n"I hope that you will be able to make her understand that I am glad she\r\nenjoyed my story, and that I hope the new book will give her pleasure\r\nby renewing her friendship with the Fairies. I shall write to her in a\r\nshort time. I am so much impressed with what I have learned of her that\r\nI have written a little poem entitled A Silent Singer, which I may send\r\nto her mother after a while. Can you tell me in what paper the article\r\nappeared accusing Helen of plagiarism, and giving passages from both\r\nstories? I should like much to see it, and to obtain a few copies if\r\npossible."\r\n\r\nUnder date of March 9, 1892, Miss Canby writes:\r\n\r\n"I find traces, in the Report which you so kindly sent me, of little\r\nHelen having heard other stories than that of \'Frost Fairies.\' On page\r\n132, in a letter, there is a passage which must have been suggested by\r\nmy story called \'The Rose Fairies\' (see pp. 13-16 of \'Birdie\') and on\r\npages 93 and 94 of the Report the description of a thunderstorm is very\r\nmuch like Birdie\'s idea of the same in the \'Dew Fairies\' on page 59 and\r\n60 of my book. What a wonderfully active and retentive mind that gifted\r\nchild must have! If she had remembered and written down accurately,\r\na short story, and that soon after hearing it, it would have been a\r\nmarvel; but to have heard the story once, three years ago, and in such\r\na way that neither her parents nor teacher could ever allude to it or\r\nrefresh her memory about it, and then to have been able to reproduce it\r\nso vividly, even adding some touches of her own in perfect keeping with\r\nthe rest, which really improve the original, is something that very few\r\ngirls of riper age, and with every advantage of sight, hearing, and even\r\ngreat talents for composition, could have done as well, if at all. Under\r\nthe circumstances, I do not see how any one can be so unkind as to call\r\nit a plagiarism; it is a wonderful feat of memory, and stands ALONE, as\r\ndoubtless much of her work will in future, if her mental powers grow and\r\ndevelop with her years as greatly as in the few years past. I have known\r\nmany children well, have been surrounded by them all my life, and love\r\nnothing better than to talk with them, amuse them, and quietly notice\r\ntheir traits of mind and character; but I do not recollect more than one\r\ngirl of Helen\'s age who had the love and thirst for knowledge, and the\r\nstore of literary and general information, and the skill in composition,\r\nwhich Helen possesses. She is indeed a \'Wonder-Child.\' Thank you very\r\nmuch for the Report, Gazette, and Helen\'s Journal. The last made me\r\nrealize the great disappointment to the dear child more than before.\r\nPlease give her my warm love, and tell her not to feel troubled about\r\nit any more. No one shall be allowed to think it was anything wrong; and\r\nsome day she will write a great, beautiful story or poem that will make\r\nmany people happy. Tell her there are a few bitter drops in every one\'s\r\ncup, and the only way is to take the bitter patiently, and the sweet\r\nthankfully. I shall love to hear of her reception of the book and how\r\nshe likes the stories which are new to her."\r\n\r\nI have now (March, 1892) read to Helen "The Frost Fairies," "The Rose\r\nFairies," and a portion of "The Dew Fairies," but she is unable to throw\r\nany light on the matter. She recognized them at once as her own stories,\r\nwith variations, and was much puzzled to know how they could have been\r\npublished before she was born! She thinks it is wonderful that two\r\npeople should write stories so much alike; but she still considers her\r\nown as original.\r\n\r\nI give below a portion of Miss Canby\'s story, "The Rose Fairies," and\r\nalso Helen\'s letter to Mr. Anagnos containing her "dream," so that the\r\nlikenesses and differences may be studied by those interested in the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE FAIRIES\r\n\r\n[From"Birdie and his Fairy Friends," by Margaret T. Canby]\r\n\r\nOne pleasant morning little Birdie might have been seen sitting quietly\r\non the grass-plat at the side of his mother\'s house, looking very\r\nearnestly at the rose-bushes.\r\n\r\nIt was quite early; great Mr. Sun, who is such an early riser in summer\r\ntime, had not been up very long; the birds were just beginning to chirp\r\ntheir "good-mornings" to each other; and as for the flowers, they were\r\nstill asleep. But Birdie was so busy all day, trotting about the house\r\nand garden, that he was always ready for HIS nest at night, before the\r\nbirds and flowers had thought of seeking THEIRS; and so it came to\r\npass that when Mr. Sun raised his head above the green woods and smiled\r\nlovingly upon the earth, Birdie was often the first to see him, and\r\nto smile back at him, all the while rubbing his eyes with his dimpled\r\nfists, until between smiling and rubbing, he was wide awake.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you think he did next! Why, the little rogue rolled into his\r\nmamma\'s bed, and kissed her eyelids, her cheeks, and her mouth, until\r\nshe began to dream that it was raining kisses; and at last she opened\r\nher eyes to see what it all meant, and found that it was Birdie, trying\r\nto "kiss her awake," as he said.\r\n\r\nShe loved her little boy very dearly, and liked to make him happy, and\r\nwhen he said, "Please dress me, dear mamma, and let me go out to play\r\nin the garden," she cheerfully consented; and, soon after, Birdie went\r\ndownstairs in his morning-dress of cool linen, and with his round face\r\nbright and rosy from its bath, and ran out on the gravel path to play,\r\nuntil breakfast was ready.\r\n\r\nHe stood still a moment to look about him, and think what he should do\r\nfirst. The fresh morning air blew softly in his face, as if to welcome\r\nhim and be his merry playmate; and the bright eye of Mr. Sun looked at\r\nhim with a warm and glowing smile; but Birdie soon walked on to find\r\nsomething to play with. As he came in sight of the rose-bushes that grew\r\nnear the side of the house, he suddenly clapped his hands, and with a\r\nlittle shout of joy stopped to look at them; they were all covered with\r\nlovely rosebuds. Some were red, some white, and others pale pink, and\r\nthey were just peeping out of the green leaves, as rosy-faced children\r\npeep out from their warm beds in wintertime before they are quite\r\nwilling to get up. A few days before, Birdie\'s papa had told him that\r\nthe green balls on the rose-bushes had beautiful flowers shut up within\r\nthem, but the little boy found it hard to believe, for he was so young\r\nthat he did not remember how pretty the roses had been the summer\r\nbefore. Now he found out that his father\'s words were true, for a few\r\ndays of warm weather had turned the green balls into rosebuds, and they\r\nwere SO beautiful that it was enough to make Birdie stand still before\r\nthem, his blue eyes dancing with delight and his little hands clasped\r\ntightly together.\r\n\r\nAfter awhile he went nearer, and looking closely at the buds, found that\r\nthey were folded up, leaf over leaf, as eyelids are folded over sleeping\r\neyes, so that Birdie thought they must be asleep. "Lazy roses, wake up,"\r\nsaid he, giving the branches a gentle shake; but only the dew fell off\r\nin bright drops, and the flowers were still shut up. At last Birdie\r\nremembered how he had awakened his mother with kisses, and thought he\r\nwould try the same plan with the roses; so he drew up his red lips until\r\nTHEY looked like a rosebud, too, and bending down a branch with a lovely\r\npink bud upon it, he kissed it softly two or three times.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the similarity in the language of the story to that in the letter\r\nceases.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELEN\'S LETTER TO MR. ANAGNOS\r\n\r\n(Written February 2 and 3, 1890.)\r\n\r\n[This letter was enclosed in another written in French, dated Le 1\r\nfevrier 1890.]\r\n\r\nMy Dear Mr. Anagnos: You will laugh when you open your little friend\'s\r\nletter and see all the queer mistakes she has made in French, but I\r\nthink you will be pleased to know that I can write even a short letter\r\nin French. It makes me very happy to please you and my dear teacher. I\r\nwish I could see your little niece Amelia. I am sure we should love each\r\nother. I hope you will bring some of Virginia Evanghelides\' poems home\r\nwith you, and translate them for me. Teacher and I have just returned\r\nfrom our walk. It is a beautiful day. We met a sweet little child. She\r\nwas playing on the pier with a wee brother. She gave me a kiss and then\r\nran away, because she was a shy little girl. I wonder if you would like\r\nto have me tell you a pretty dream which I had a long time ago when I\r\nwas a very little child? Teacher says it was a day-dream, and she thinks\r\nyou would be delighted to hear it. One pleasant morning in the beautiful\r\nspringtime, I thought I was sitting on the soft grass under my dear\r\nmother\'s window, looking very earnestly at the rose-bushes which were\r\ngrowing all around me. It was quite early, the sun had not been up very\r\nlong; the birds were just beginning to sing joyously. The flowers were\r\nstill asleep. They would not awake until the sun had smiled lovingly\r\nupon them. I was a very happy little child with rosy cheeks, and large\r\nblue eyes, and the most beautiful golden ringlets you can imagine. The\r\nfresh morning air blew gently in my face, as if to welcome me, and be my\r\nmerry playmate, and the sun looked at me with a warm and tender smile.\r\nI clapped my chubby hands for joy when I saw that the rose-bushes were\r\ncovered with lovely buds. Some were red, some white, and others were\r\ndelicate pink, and they were peeping out from between the green leaves\r\nlike beautiful little fairies. I had never seen anything so lovely\r\nbefore, for I was very young and I could not remember how pretty the\r\nroses had been the summer before. My little heart was filled with a\r\nsweet joy, and I danced around the rosebushes to show my delight.\r\nAfter a while I went very near to a beautiful white rose-bush which was\r\ncompletely covered with buds and sparkling with dewdrops; I bent down\r\none of the branches with a lovely pure white bud upon it, and kissed it\r\nsoftly many times; just then I felt two loving arms steal gently around\r\nme, and loving lips kissing my eyelids, my cheeks, and my mouth, until\r\nI began to think it was raining kisses; and at last I opened my eyes\r\nto see what it all meant, and found it was my precious mother, who was\r\nbending over me, trying to kiss me awake. Do you like my day-dream? If\r\nyou do, perhaps I will dream again for you some time.\r\n\r\nTeacher and all of your friends send you their love. I shall be so glad\r\nwhen you come home, for I greatly miss you. Please give my love to your\r\ngood Greek friends, and tell them that I shall come to Athens some day.\r\n\r\nLovingly your little friend and playmate, HELEN A. KELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n"The Frost Fairies" and "The Frost Kings" are given in full, as the\r\ndifferences are as important as the resemblances:\r\n\r\nThe Frost Fairies [From "Birdie and his Fairy Friends"] by Margaret T.\r\nCanby\r\n\r\nKing Frost, or Jack Frost as he is sometimes called, lives in a cold\r\ncountry far to the North; but every year he takes a journey over the\r\nworld in a car of golden clouds drawn by a strong and rapid steed called\r\n"North Wind." Wherever he goes he does many wonderful things; he builds\r\nbridges over every stream, clear as glass in appearance but often strong\r\nas iron; he puts the flowers and plants to sleep by one touch of his\r\nhand, and they all bow down and sink into the warm earth, until spring\r\nreturns; then, lest we should grieve for the flowers, he places at our\r\nwindows lovely wreaths and sprays of his white northern flowers,\r\nor delicate little forests of fairy pine-trees, pure white and very\r\nbeautiful. But his most wonderful work is the painting of the trees,\r\nwhich look, after his task is done, as if they were covered with the\r\nbrightest layers of gold and rubies; and are beautiful enough to comfort\r\nus for the flight of summer.\r\n\r\nI will tell you how King Frost first thought of this kind work, for it\r\nis a strange story. You must know that this King, like all other kings,\r\nhas great treasures of gold and precious stones in his palace; but,\r\nbeing a good-hearted old fellow, he does not keep his riches locked up\r\nall the time, but tries to do good and make others happy with them. He\r\nhas two neighbours, who live still farther north; one is King Winter, a\r\ncross and churlish old monarch, who is hard and cruel, and delights in\r\nmaking the poor suffer and weep; but the other neighbour is Santa Claus,\r\na fine, good-natured, jolly old soul, who loves to do good, and who\r\nbrings presents to the poor, and to nice little children at Christmas.\r\n\r\nWell, one day King Frost was trying to think of some good that he could\r\ndo with his treasure; and suddenly he concluded to send some of it to\r\nhis kind neighbour, Santa Claus, to buy presents of food and clothing\r\nfor the poor, that they might not suffer so much when King Winter went\r\nnear their homes. So he called together his merry little fairies, and\r\nshowing them a number of jars and vases filled with gold and precious\r\nstones, told them to carry those carefully to the palace of Santa Claus,\r\nand give them to him with the compliments of King Frost. "He will know\r\nhow to make good use of the treasure," added Jack Frost; then he told\r\nthe fairies not to loiter by the way, but to do his bidding quickly.\r\n\r\nThe fairies promised obedience and soon started on their journey,\r\ndragging the great glass jars and vases along, as well as they could,\r\nand now and then grumbling a little at having such hard work to do, for\r\nthey were idle fairies, and liked play better than work. At last they\r\nreached a great forest, and, being quite tired, they decided to rest\r\nawhile and look for nuts before going any further. But lest the treasure\r\nshould be stolen from them, they hid the jars among the thick leaves\r\nof the forest trees, placing some high up near the top, and others in\r\ndifferent parts of the various trees, until they thought no one could\r\nfind them.\r\n\r\nThen they began to wander about and hunt for nuts, and climb the trees\r\nto shake them down, and worked much harder for their own pleasure than\r\nthey had done for their master\'s bidding, for it is a strange truth that\r\nfairies and children never complain of the toil and trouble they take in\r\nsearch of amusement, although they often grumble when asked to work for\r\nthe good of others.\r\n\r\nThe frost fairies were so busy and so merry over their nutting frolic\r\nthat they soon forgot their errand and their king\'s command to go\r\nquickly; but, as they played and loitered in the forest until noon, they\r\nfound the reason why they were told to hasten; for although they had, as\r\nthey thought, hidden the treasure so carefully, they had not secured it\r\nfrom the power of Mr. Sun, who was an enemy of Jack Frost, and delighted\r\nto undo his work and weaken him whenever he could.\r\n\r\nHis bright eyes found out the jars of treasure among the trees, and as\r\nthe idle fairies left them there until noon, at which time Mr. Sun is\r\nthe strongest, the delicate glass began to melt and break, and before\r\nlong every jar and vase was cracked or broken, and the precious\r\ntreasures they contained were melting, too, and dripping slowly in\r\nstreams of gold and crimson over the trees and bushes of the forest.\r\n\r\nStill, for awhile, the frost fairies did not notice this strange\r\noccurrence, for they were down on the grass, so far below the tree-tops\r\nthat the wonderful shower of treasure was a long time in reaching\r\nthem; but at last one of them said, "Hark! I believe it is raining; I\r\ncertainly hear the falling drops." The others laughed, and told him that\r\nit seldom rained when the sun was shining; but as they listened they\r\nplainly heard the tinkling of many drops falling through the forest, and\r\nsliding from leaf to leaf until they reached the bramble-bushes beside\r\nthem, when, to their great dismay, they found that the RAIN-DROPS were\r\nMELTED RUBIES, which hardened on the leaves and turned them to bright\r\ncrimson in a moment. Then looking more closely at the trees around,\r\nthey saw that the treasure was all melting away, and that much of it was\r\nalready spread over the leaves of the oak trees and maples, which\r\nwere shining with their gorgeous dress of gold and bronze, crimson\r\nand emerald. It was very beautiful; but the idle fairies were too much\r\nfrightened at the mischief their disobedience had caused, to admire the\r\nbeauty of the forest, and at once tried to hide themselves among the\r\nbushes, lest King Frost should come and punish them.\r\n\r\nTheir fears were well founded, for their long absence had alarmed the\r\nking, and he had started out to look for his tardy servants, and just as\r\nthey were all hidden, he came along slowly, looking on all sides for the\r\nfairies. Of course, he soon noticed the brightness of the leaves, and\r\ndiscovered the cause, too, when he caught sight of the broken jars and\r\nvases from which the melted treasure was still dropping. And when he\r\ncame to the nut trees, and saw the shells left by the idle fairies and\r\nall the traces of their frolic, he knew exactly how they had acted,\r\nand that they had disobeyed him by playing and loitering on their way\r\nthrough the woods.\r\n\r\nKing Frost frowned and looked very angry at first, and his fairies\r\ntrembled for fear and cowered still lower in their hiding-places; but\r\njust then two little children came dancing through the wood, and though\r\nthey did not see King Frost or the fairies, they saw the beautiful\r\ncolour of the leaves, and laughed with delight, and began picking great\r\nbunches to take to their mother. "The leaves are as pretty as flowers,"\r\nsaid they; and they called the golden leaves "buttercups," and the red\r\nones "roses," and were very happy as they went singing through the wood.\r\n\r\nTheir pleasure charmed away King Frost\'s anger, and he, too, began to\r\nadmire the painted trees, and at last he said to himself, "My treasures\r\nare not wasted if they make little children happy. I will not be\r\noffended at my idle, thoughtless fairies, for they have taught me a new\r\nway of doing good." When the frost fairies heard these words they crept,\r\none by one, from their corners, and, kneeling down before their master,\r\nconfessed their fault, and asked his pardon. He frowned upon them for\r\nawhile, and scolded them, too, but he soon relented, and said he would\r\nforgive them this time, and would only punish them by making them carry\r\nmore treasure to the forest, and hide it in the trees, until all the\r\nleaves, with Mr. Sun\'s help, were covered with gold and ruby coats.\r\n\r\nThen the fairies thanked him for his forgiveness, and promised to work\r\nvery hard to please him; and the good-natured king took them all up in\r\nhis arms, and carried them safely home to his palace. From that time, I\r\nsuppose, it has been part of Jack Frost\'s work to paint the trees with\r\nthe glowing colours we see in the autumn; and if they are NOT covered\r\nwith gold and precious stones, I do not know how he makes them so\r\nbright; DO YOU?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Frost King by Helen A. Keller\r\n\r\nKing Frost lives in a beautiful palace far to the North, in the land of\r\nperpetual snow. The palace, which is magnificent beyond description, was\r\nbuilt centuries ago, in the reign of King Glacier. At a little distance\r\nfrom the palace we might easily mistake it for a mountain whose peaks\r\nwere mounting heavenward to receive the last kiss of the departing\r\nday. But on nearer approach we should discover our error. What we had\r\nsupposed to be peaks were in reality a thousand glittering spires.\r\nNothing could be more beautiful than the architecture of this\r\nice-palace. The walls are curiously constructed of massive blocks of ice\r\nwhich terminate in cliff-like towers. The entrance to the palace is at\r\nthe end of an arched recess, and it is guarded night and day by twelve\r\nsoldierly-looking white Bears.\r\n\r\nBut, children, you must make King Frost a visit the very first\r\nopportunity you have, and see for yourselves this wonderful palace. The\r\nold King will welcome you kindly, for he loves children, and it is his\r\nchief delight to give them pleasure.\r\n\r\nYou must know that King Frost, like all other kings, has great treasures\r\nof gold and precious stones; but as he is a generous old monarch, he\r\nendeavours to make a right use of his riches. So wherever he goes he\r\ndoes many wonderful works; he builds bridges over every stream, as\r\ntransparent as glass, but often as strong as iron; he shakes the forest\r\ntrees until the ripe nuts fall into the laps of laughing children; he\r\nputs the flowers to sleep with one touch of his hand; then, lest we\r\nshould mourn for the bright faces of the flowers, he paints the leaves\r\nwith gold and crimson and emerald, and when his task is done the trees\r\nare beautiful enough to comfort us for the flight of summer. I will tell\r\nyou how King Frost happened to think of painting the leaves, for it is a\r\nstrange story.\r\n\r\nOne day while King Frost was surveying his vast wealth and thinking what\r\ngood he could do with it, he suddenly bethought him of his jolly old\r\nneighbour, Santa Claus. "I will send my treasures to Santa Claus,"\r\nsaid the King to himself. "He is the very man to dispose of them\r\nsatisfactorily, for he knows where the poor and the unhappy live, and\r\nhis kind old heart is always full of benevolent plans for their relief."\r\nSo he called together the merry little fairies of his household and,\r\nshowing them the jars and vases containing his treasures, he bade them\r\ncarry them to the palace of Santa Claus as quickly as they could. The\r\nfairies promised obedience, and were off in a twinkling, dragging the\r\nheavy jars and vases along after them as well as they could, now and\r\nthen grumbling a little at having such a hard task, for they were idle\r\nfairies and loved to play better than to work. After awhile they came to\r\na great forest and, being tired and hungry, they thought they would rest\r\na little and look for nuts before continuing their journey. But thinking\r\ntheir treasure might be stolen from them, they hid the jars among the\r\nthick green leaves of the various trees until they were sure that no one\r\ncould find them. Then they began to wander merrily about searching for\r\nnuts, climbing trees, peeping curiously into the empty birds\' nests, and\r\nplaying hide and seek from behind the trees. Now, these naughty fairies\r\nwere so busy and so merry over their frolic that they forgot all about\r\ntheir errand and their master\'s command to go quickly, but soon they\r\nfound to their dismay why they had been bidden to hasten, for although\r\nthey had, as they supposed, hidden the treasure carefully, yet the\r\nbright eyes of King Sun had spied out the jars among the leaves, and\r\nas he and King Frost could never agree as to what was the best way of\r\nbenefiting the world, he was very glad of a good opportunity of playing\r\na joke upon his rather sharp rival. King Sun laughed softly to himself\r\nwhen the delicate jars began to melt and break. At length every jar and\r\nvase was cracked or broken, and the precious stones they contained were\r\nmelting, too, and running in little streams over the trees and bushes of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nStill the idle fairies did not notice what was happening, for they were\r\ndown on the grass, and the wonderful shower of treasure was a long time\r\nin reaching them; but at last they plainly heard the tinkling of many\r\ndrops falling like rain through the forest, and sliding from leaf to\r\nleaf until they reached the little bushes by their side, when to their\r\nastonishment they discovered that the rain-drops were melted rubies\r\nwhich hardened on the leaves, and turned them to crimson and gold in\r\na moment. Then looking around more closely, they saw that much of the\r\ntreasure was already melted, for the oaks and maples were arrayed in\r\ngorgeous dresses of gold and crimson and emerald. It was very beautiful,\r\nbut the disobedient fairies were too frightened to notice the beauty of\r\nthe trees. They were afraid that King Frost would come and punish\r\nthem. So they hid themselves among the bushes and waited silently for\r\nsomething to happen. Their fears were well founded, for their long\r\nabsence had alarmed the King, and he mounted North Wind and went out\r\nin search of his tardy couriers. Of course, he had not gone far when he\r\nnoticed the brightness of the leaves, and he quickly guessed the cause\r\nwhen he saw the broken jars from which the treasure was still dropping.\r\nAt first King Frost was very angry, and the fairies trembled and\r\ncrouched lower in their hiding-places, and I do not know what might have\r\nhappened to them if just then a party of boys and girls had not entered\r\nthe wood. When the children saw the trees all aglow with brilliant\r\ncolors they clapped their hands and shouted for joy, and immediately\r\nbegan to pick great bunches to take home. "The leaves are as lovely as\r\nthe flowers!" cried they, in their delight. Their pleasure banished the\r\nanger from King Frost\'s heart and the frown from his brow, and he, too,\r\nbegan to admire the painted trees. He said to himself, "My treasures are\r\nnot wasted if they make little children happy. My idle fairies and my\r\nfiery enemy have taught me a new way of doing good."\r\n\r\nWhen the fairies heard this, they were greatly relieved and came\r\nforth from their hiding-places, confessed their fault, and asked their\r\nmaster\'s forgiveness.\r\n\r\nEver since that time it has been King Frost\'s great delight to paint the\r\nleaves with the glowing colors we see in the autumn, and if they are not\r\ncovered with gold and precious stones I cannot imagine what makes them\r\nso bright, can you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the story of "The Frost Fairies" was read to Helen in the summer of\r\n1888, she could not have understood very much of it at that time, for\r\nshe had only been under instruction since March, 1887.\r\n\r\nCan it be that the language of the story had remained dormant in her\r\nmind until my description of the beauty of the autumn scenery in 1891\r\nbrought it vividly before her mental vision?\r\n\r\nI have made careful investigation among Helen\'s friends in Alabama and\r\nin Boston and its vicinity, but thus far have been unable to ascertain\r\nany later date when it could have been read to her.\r\n\r\nAnother fact is of great significance in this connection. "The Rose\r\nFairies" was published in the same volume with "The Frost Fairies," and,\r\ntherefore, was probably read to Helen at or about the same time.\r\n\r\nNow Helen, in her letter of February, 1890 (quoted above), alludes to\r\nthis story of Miss Canby\'s as a dream "WHICH I HAD A LONG TIME AGO WHEN\r\nI WAS A VERY LITTLE CHILD." Surely, a year and a half would appear "a\r\nlong time ago" to a little girl like Helen; we therefore have reason to\r\nbelieve that the stories must have been read to her at least as early as\r\nthe summer of 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELEN KELLER\'S OWN STATEMENT\r\n\r\n(The following entry made by Helen in her diary speaks for itself.)\r\n\r\n\'1892. January 30. This morning I took a bath, and when teacher came\r\nupstairs to comb my hair she told me some very sad news which made me\r\nunhappy all day. Some one wrote to Mr. Anagnos that the story which I\r\nsent him as a birthday gift, and which I wrote myself, was not my story\r\nat all, but that a lady had written it a long time ago. The person said\r\nher story was called "Frost Fairies." I am sure I never heard it. It\r\nmade us feel so bad to think that people thought we had been untrue and\r\nwicked. My heart was full of tears, for I love the beautiful truth with\r\nmy whole heart and mind.\r\n\r\n\'It troubles me greatly now. I do not know what I shall do. I never\r\nthought that people could make such mistakes. I am perfectly sure I\r\nwrote the story myself. Mr. Anagnos is much troubled. It grieves me to\r\nthink that I have been the cause of his unhappiness, but of course I did\r\nnot mean to do it.\r\n\r\n\'I thought about my story in the autumn, because teacher told me about\r\nthe autumn leaves while we walked in the woods at Fern Quarry. I thought\r\nfairies must have painted them because they are so wonderful, and\r\nI thought, too, that King Frost must have jars and vases containing\r\nprecious treasures, because I knew that other kings long ago had, and\r\nbecause teacher told me that the leaves were painted ruby, emerald,\r\ngold, crimson, and brown; so that I thought the paint must be melted\r\nstones. I knew that they must make children happy because they are\r\nso lovely, and it made me very happy to think that the leaves were so\r\nbeautiful and that the trees glowed so, although I could not see them.\r\n\r\n\'I thought everybody had the same thought about the leaves, but I do not\r\nknow now. I thought very much about the sad news when teacher went to\r\nthe doctor\'s; she was not here at dinner and I missed her.\'\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not feel that I can add anything more that will be of interest.\r\nMy own heart is too "full of tears" when I remember how my dear little\r\npupil suffered when she knew "that people thought we had been untrue and\r\nwicked," for I know that she does indeed "love the beautiful truth with\r\nher whole heart and mind."\r\n\r\nYours truly, ANNIE M. SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much appears in the Volta Bureau Souvenir. The following letter from\r\nMr. Anagnos is reprinted from the American Annals of the Deaf, April,\r\n1892:\r\n\r\nPERKINS INSTITUTION AND MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND SO. BOSTON,\r\nMarch 11, 1892. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ANNALS.\r\n\r\nSir: In compliance with your wishes I make the following statement\r\nconcerning Helen Keller\'s story of "King Frost." It was sent to me as a\r\nbirthday gift on November 7th, from Tuscumbia, Alabama. Knowing as well\r\nas I do Helen\'s extraordinary abilities I did not hesitate to accept\r\nit as her own work; nor do I doubt to-day that she is fully capable of\r\nwriting such a composition. Soon after its appearance in print I was\r\npained to learn, through the Goodson Gazette, that a portion of the\r\nstory (eight or nine passages) is either a reproduction or adaptation\r\nof Miss Margaret Canby\'s "Frost Fairies." I immediately instituted an\r\ninquiry to ascertain the facts in the case. None of our teachers or\r\nofficers who are accustomed to converse with Helen ever knew or heard\r\nabout Miss Canby\'s book, nor did the child\'s parents and relatives at\r\nhome have any knowledge of it. Her father, Captain Keller, wrote to me\r\nas follows on the subject:\r\n\r\n"I hasten to assure you that Helen could not have received any idea of\r\nthe story from any of her relations or friends here, none of whom can\r\ncommunicate with her readily enough to impress her with the details of a\r\nstory of that character."\r\n\r\nAt my request, one of the teachers in the girls\' department examined\r\nHelen in regard to the construction of the story. Her testimony is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n"I first tried to ascertain what had suggested to Helen\'s mind the\r\nparticular fancies which made her story seem like a reproduction of one\r\nwritten by Miss Margaret Canby. Helen told me that for a long time she\r\nhad thought of Jack Frost as a king, because of the many treasures which\r\nhe possessed. Such rich treasures must be kept in a safe place, and so\r\nshe had imagined them stored in jars and vases in one part of the royal\r\npalace. She said that one autumn day her teacher told her as they were\r\nwalking together in the woods, about the many beautiful colours of\r\nthe leaves, and she had thought that such beauty must make people very\r\nhappy, and very grateful to King Frost. I asked Helen what stories she\r\nhad read about Jack Frost. In answer to my question she recited a part\r\nof the poem called \'Freaks of the Frost,\' and she referred to a little\r\npiece about winter, in one of the school readers. She could not remember\r\nthat any one had ever read to her any stories about King Frost, but\r\nsaid she had talked with her teacher about Jack Frost and the wonderful\r\nthings he did."\r\n\r\nThe only person that we supposed might possibly have read the story to\r\nHelen was her friend, Mrs. Hopkins, whom she was visiting at the time\r\nin Brewster. I asked Miss Sullivan to go at once to see Mrs. Hopkins and\r\nascertain the facts in the matter. The result of her investigation\r\nis embodied in the printed note herewith enclosed. [This note is a\r\nstatement of the bare facts and an apology, which Mr. Anagnos inserted\r\nin his report of the Perkins Institute.]\r\n\r\nI have scarcely any doubt that Miss Canby\'s little book was read to\r\nHelen, by Mrs. Hopkins, in the summer of 1888. But the child has\r\nno recollection whatever of this fact. On Miss Sullivan\'s return to\r\nBrewster, she read to Helen the story of "Little Lord Fauntleroy,"\r\nwhich she had purchased in Boston for the purpose. The child was at once\r\nfascinated and absorbed with the charming story, which evidently made a\r\ndeeper impression upon her mind than any previously read to her, as\r\nwas shown in the frequent reference to it, both in her conversation and\r\nletters, for many months afterward. Her intense interest in Fauntleroy\r\nmust have buried all remembrance of "Frost Fairies," and when, more\r\nthan three years later, she had acquired a fuller knowledge and use\r\nof language, and was told of Jack Frost and his work, the seed so long\r\nburied sprang up into new thoughts and fancies. This may explain the\r\nreason why Helen claims persistently that "The Frost King" is her own\r\nstory. She seems to have some idea of the difference between original\r\ncomposition and reproduction. She did not know the meaning of the word\r\n"plagiarism" until quite recently, when it was explained to her. She is\r\nabsolutely truthful. Veracity is the strongest element of her character.\r\nShe was very much surprised and grieved when she was told that her\r\ncomposition was an adaptation of Miss Canby\'s story of "Frost Fairies."\r\nShe could not keep back her tears, and the chief cause of her pain\r\nseemed to be the fear lest people should doubt her truthfulness. She\r\nsaid, with great intensity of feeling, "I love the beautiful truth."\r\nA most rigid examination of the child of about two hours\' duration, at\r\nwhich eight persons were present and asked all sorts of questions with\r\nperfect freedom, failed to elicit in the least any testimony convicting\r\neither her teacher or any one else of the intention or attempt to\r\npractice deception.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts I cannot but think that Helen, while writing "The\r\nFrost King," was entirely unconscious of ever having had the story of\r\n"Frost Fairies" read to her, and that her memory has been accompanied\r\nby such a loss of associations that she herself honestly believed her\r\ncomposition to be original. This theory is shared by many persons who\r\nare perfectly well acquainted with the child and who are able to rise\r\nabove the clouds of a narrow prejudice.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely yours, M. ANAGNOS. Director of the Perkins Institution\r\nand Massachusetts School for the Blind.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe episode had a deadening effect on Helen Keller and on Miss Sullivan,\r\nwho feared that she had allowed the habit of imitation, which has in\r\ntruth made Miss Keller a writer, to go too far. Even to-day, when\r\nMiss Keller strikes off a fine phrase, Miss Sullivan says in humorous\r\ndespair, "I wonder where she got that?" But she knows now, since she has\r\nstudied with her pupil in college the problems of composition, under the\r\nwise advice of Mr. Charles T. Copeland, that the style of every writer\r\nand indeed, of every human being, illiterate or cultivated, is a\r\ncomposite reminiscence of all that he has read and heard. Of the sources\r\nof his vocabulary he is, for the most part, as unaware as he is of the\r\nmoment when he ate the food which makes a bit of his thumbnail. With\r\nmost of us the contributions from different sources are blended, crossed\r\nand confused. A child with but few sources may keep distinct what he\r\ndraws from each. In this case Helen Keller held almost intact in her\r\nmind, unmixed with other ideas, the words of a story which at the time\r\nit was read to her she did not fully understand. The importance of this\r\ncannot be overestimated. It shows how the child-mind gathers into itself\r\nwords it has heard, and how they lurk there ready to come out when\r\nthe key that releases the spring is touched. The reason that we do not\r\nobserve this process in ordinary children is, because we seldom observe\r\nthem at all, and because they are fed from so many sources that the\r\nmemories are confused and mutually destructive. The story of "The Frost\r\nKing" did not, however, come from Helen Keller\'s mind intact, but had\r\ntaken to itself the mould of the child\'s temperament and had drawn on\r\na vocabulary that to some extent had been supplied in other ways. The\r\nstyle of her version is in some respects even better than the style\r\nof Miss Canby\'s story. It has the imaginative credulity of a primitive\r\nfolktale; whereas Miss Canby\'s story is evidently told for children\r\nby an older person, who adopts the manner of a fairy tale and cannot\r\nconceal the mature mood which allows such didactic phrases as "Jack\r\nFrost as he is sometimes called," "Noon, at which time Mr. Sun is\r\nstrongest." Most people will feel the superior imaginative quality of\r\nHelen Keller\'s opening paragraph. Surely the writer must become as a\r\nlittle child to see things like that. "Twelve soldierly-looking white\r\nbears" is a stroke of genius, and there is beauty of rhythm throughout\r\nthe child\'s narrative. It is original in the same way that a poet\'s\r\nversion of an old story is original.\r\n\r\nThis little story calls into life all the questions of language and the\r\nphilosophy of style. Some conclusions may be briefly suggested.\r\n\r\nAll use of language is imitative, and one\'s style is made up of all\r\nother styles that one has met.\r\n\r\nThe way to write good English is to read it and hear it. Thus it is that\r\nany child may be taught to use correct English by not being allowed to\r\nread or hear any other kind. In a child, the selection of the better\r\nfrom the worse is not conscious; he is the servant of his word\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary man will never be rid of the fallacy that words obey\r\nthought, that one thinks first and phrases afterward. There must first,\r\nit is true, be the intention, the desire to utter something, but the\r\nidea does not often become specific, does not take shape until it is\r\nphrased; certainly an idea is a different thing by virtue of being\r\nphrased. Words often make the thought, and the master of words will say\r\nthings greater than are in him. A remarkable example is a paragraph from\r\nMiss Keller\'s sketch in the Youth\'s Companion. Writing of the moment\r\nwhen she learned that everything has a name, she says: "We met the nurse\r\ncarrying my little cousin; and teacher spelled \'baby.\' AND FOR THE FIRST\r\nTIME I was impressed with the smallness and helplessness of a little\r\nbaby, and mingled with the thought there was another one of myself, and\r\nI was glad I was myself, and not a baby." It was a word that created\r\nthese thoughts in her mind. So the master of words is master of thoughts\r\nwhich the words create, and says things greater than he could otherwise\r\nknow. Helen Keller writing "The Frost King" was building better than she\r\nknew and saying more than she meant.\r\n\r\nWhoever makes a sentence of words utters not his wisdom, but the wisdom\r\nof the race whose life is in the words, though they have never been\r\nso grouped before. The man who can write stories thinks of stories to\r\nwrite. The medium calls forth the thing it conveys, and the greater the\r\nmedium the deeper the thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe educated man is the man whose expression is educated. The substance\r\nof thought is language, and language is the one thing to teach the deaf\r\nchild and every other child. Let him get language and he gets the very\r\nstuff that language is made of, the thought and the experience of his\r\nrace. The language must be one used by a nation, not an artificial\r\nthing. Volapuk is a paradox, unless one has French or English or German\r\nor some other language that has grown up in a nation. The deaf child who\r\nhas only the sign language of De l\'Epee is an intellectual Philip Nolan,\r\nan alien from all races, and his thoughts are not the thoughts of an\r\nEnglishman, or a Frenchman, or a Spaniard. The Lord\'s prayer in signs is\r\nnot the Lord\'s prayer in English.\r\n\r\nIn his essay on style De Quincey says that the best English is to be\r\nfound in the letters of the cultivated gentlewoman, because she has\r\nread only a few good books and has not been corrupted by the style of\r\nnewspapers and the jargon of street, market-place, and assembly hall.\r\n\r\nPrecisely these outward circumstances account for Helen Keller\'s use of\r\nEnglish. In the early years of her education she had only good things to\r\nread; some were, indeed, trivial and not excellent in style, but not\r\none was positively bad in manner or substance. This happy condition\r\nhas obtained throughout her life. She has been nurtured on imaginative\r\nliterature, and she has gathered from it into her vigorous and tenacious\r\nmemory the style of great writers. "A new word opens its heart to me,"\r\nshe writes in a letter; and when she uses the word its heart is still\r\nopen. When she was twelve years old, she was asked what book she would\r\ntake on a long railroad journey. "Paradise Lost," she answered, and she\r\nread it on the train.\r\n\r\nUntil the last year or two she has not been master of her style,\r\nrather has her style been master of her. It is only since she has made\r\ncomposition a more conscious study that she has ceased to be the victim\r\nof the phrase; the lucky victim, fortunately, of the good phrase.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1892, she was encouraged to write a sketch of her life for the\r\nYouth\'s Companion, in the hope that it would reassure her and help her\r\nto recover from the effect of "The Frost King," she produced a piece\r\nof composition which is much more remarkable and in itself more\r\nentertaining at some points than the corresponding part of her story in\r\nthis book. When she came to retell the story in a fuller form, the echo\r\nwas still in her mind of the phrases she had written nine years before.\r\nYet she had not seen her sketch in the Youth\'s Companion since she wrote\r\nit, except two passages which Miss Sullivan read to her to remind her of\r\nthings she should say in this autobiography, and to show her, when her\r\nphrasing troubled her, how much better she did as a little girl.\r\n\r\nFrom the early sketch I take a few passages which seem to me, without\r\nmaking very much allowance for difference in time, almost as good as\r\nanything she has written since:\r\n\r\nI discovered the true way to walk when I was a year old, and during the\r\nradiant summer days that followed I was never still a minute....\r\n\r\nThen when my father came in the evening, I would run to the gate to meet\r\nhim, and he would take me up in his strong arms and put back the tangled\r\ncurls from my face and kiss me many times, saying, "What has my Little\r\nWoman been doing to-day?"\r\n\r\nBut the brightest summer has winter behind it. In the cold, dreary month\r\nof February, when I was nineteen months old, I had a serious illness.\r\nI still have confused memories of that illness. My mother sat beside my\r\nlittle bed and tried to soothe my feverish moans while in her troubled\r\nheart she prayed, "Father in Heaven, spare my baby\'s life!" But the\r\nfever grew and flamed in my eyes, and for several days my kind physician\r\nthought I would die.\r\n\r\nBut early one morning the fever left me as mysteriously and unexpectedly\r\nas it had come, and I fell into a quiet sleep. Then my parents knew I\r\nwould live, and they were very happy. They did not know for some time\r\nafter my recovery that the cruel fever had taken my sight and hearing;\r\ntaken all the light and music and gladness out of my little life.\r\n\r\nBut I was too young to realize what had happened. When I awoke and found\r\nthat all was dark and still, I suppose I thought it was night, and I\r\nmust have wondered why day was so long coming. Gradually, however, I got\r\nused to the silence and darkness that surrounded me, and forgot that it\r\nhad ever been day.\r\n\r\nI forgot everything that had been except my mother\'s tender love. Soon\r\neven my childish voice was stilled, because I had ceased to hear any\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nBut all was not lost! After all, sight and hearing are but two of the\r\nbeautiful blessings which God had given me. The most precious, the\r\nmost wonderful of His gifts was still mine. My mind remained clear and\r\nactive, "though fled fore\'er the light."\r\n\r\nAs soon as my strength returned, I began to take an interest in what the\r\npeople around me were doing. I would cling to my mother\'s dress as she\r\nwent about her household duties, and my little hands felt every object\r\nand observed every motion, and in this way I learned a great many\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a little older I felt the need of some means of communication\r\nwith those around me, and I began to make simple signs which my parents\r\nand friends readily understood; but it often happened that I was unable\r\nto express my thoughts intelligibly, and at such times I would give way\r\nto my angry feelings utterly....\r\n\r\nTeacher had been with me nearly two weeks, and I had learned eighteen\r\nor twenty words, before that thought flashed into my mind, as the sun\r\nbreaks upon the sleeping world; and in that moment of illumination the\r\nsecret of language was revealed to me, and I caught a glimpse of the\r\nbeautiful country I was about to explore.\r\n\r\nTeacher had been trying all the morning to make me understand that the\r\nmug and the milk in the mug had different names; but I was very dull,\r\nand kept spelling MILK for mug, and mug for milk until teacher must have\r\nlost all hope of making me see my mistake. At last she got up, gave\r\nme the mug, and led me out of the door to the pump-house. Some one was\r\npumping water, and as the cool fresh stream burst forth, teacher made me\r\nput my mug under the spout and spelled "w-a-t-e-r," Water!\r\n\r\nThat word startled my soul, and it awoke, full of the spirit of the\r\nmorning, full of joyous, exultant song. Until that day my mind had been\r\nlike a darkened chamber, waiting for words to enter and light the lamp,\r\nwhich is thought....\r\n\r\nI learned a great many words that day. I do not remember what they all\r\nwere; but I do know that MOTHER, FATHER, SISTER and TEACHER were among\r\nthem. It would have been difficult to find a happier little child than I\r\nwas that night as I lay in my crib and thought over the joy the day had\r\nbrought me, and for the first time longed for a new day to come.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I awoke with joy in my heart. Everything I touched\r\nseemed to quiver with life. It was because I saw everything with the\r\nnew, strange, beautiful sight which had been given me. I was never angry\r\nafter that because I understood what my friends said to me, and I was\r\nvery busy learning many wonderful things. I was never still during the\r\nfirst glad days of my freedom. I was continually spelling and acting\r\nout the words as I spelled them. I would run, skip, jump and swing, no\r\nmatter where I happened to be. Everything was budding and blossoming.\r\nThe honeysuckle hung in long garlands, deliciously fragrant, and\r\nthe roses had never been so beautiful before. Teacher and I lived\r\nout-of-doors from morning until night, and I rejoiced greatly in the\r\nforgotten light and sunshine found again....\r\n\r\nThe morning after our arrival I awoke bright and early. A beautiful\r\nsummer day had dawned, the day on which I was to make the acquaintance\r\nof a somber and mysterious friend. I got up, and dressed quickly and ran\r\ndownstairs. I met Teacher in the hall, and begged to be taken to the\r\nsea at once. "Not yet," she responded, laughing. "We must have breakfast\r\nfirst." As soon as breakfast was over we hurried off to the shore. Our\r\npathway led through low, sandy hills, and as we hastened on, I often\r\ncaught my feet in the long, coarse grass, and tumbled, laughing, in the\r\nwarm, shining sand. The beautiful, warm air was peculiarly fragrant, and\r\nI noticed it got cooler and fresher as we went on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we stopped, and I knew, without being told, the Sea was at my\r\nfeet. I knew, too, it was immense! awful! and for a moment some of the\r\nsunshine seemed to have gone out of the day. But I do not think I was\r\nafraid; for later, when I had put on my bathing-suit, and the little\r\nwaves ran up on the beach and kissed my feet, I shouted for joy, and\r\nplunged fearlessly into the surf. But, unfortunately, I struck my foot\r\non a rock and fell forward into the cold water.\r\n\r\nThen a strange, fearful sense of danger terrified me. The salt water\r\nfilled my eyes, and took away my breath, and a great wave threw me up on\r\nthe beach as easily as if I had been a little pebble. For several days\r\nafter that I was very timid, and could hardly be persuaded to go in the\r\nwater at all; but by degrees my courage returned, and almost before the\r\nsummer was over, I thought it the greatest fun to be tossed about by the\r\nsea-waves....\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the difference or the similarity in phrasing\r\nbetween the child\'s version and the woman\'s is the more remarkable. The\r\nearly story is simpler and shows less deliberate artifice, though even\r\nthen Miss Keller was prematurely conscious of style, but the art of the\r\nlater narrative, as in the passage about the sea, or the passage on the\r\nmedallion of Homer, is surely a fulfilment of the promise of the early\r\nstory. It was in these early days that Dr. Holmes wrote to her: "I am\r\ndelighted with the style of your letters. There is no affectation about\r\nthem, and as they come straight from your heart, so they go straight to\r\nmine."\r\n\r\nIn the years when she was growing out of childhood, her style lost its\r\nearly simplicity and became stiff and, as she says, "periwigged." In\r\nthese years the fear came many times to Miss Sullivan lest the success\r\nof the child was to cease with childhood. At times Miss Keller seemed\r\nto lack flexibility, her thoughts ran in set phrases which she seemed to\r\nhave no power to revise or turn over in new ways.\r\n\r\nThen came the work in college--original theme writing with new ideals\r\nof composition or at least new methods of suggesting those ideals.\r\nMiss Keller began to get the better of her old friendly taskmaster, the\r\nphrase. This book, her first mature experiment in writing, settles the\r\nquestion of her ability to write.\r\n\r\nThe style of the Bible is everywhere in Miss Keller\'s work, just as\r\nit is in the style of most great English writers. Stevenson, whom\r\nMiss Sullivan likes and used to read to her pupil, is another marked\r\ninfluence. In her autobiography are many quotations, chiefly from the\r\nBible and Stevenson, distinct from the context or interwoven with it,\r\nthe whole a fabric quite of her own design. Her vocabulary has all\r\nthe phrases that other people use, and the explanation of it, and the\r\nreasonableness of it ought to be evident by this time. There is no\r\nreason why she should strike from her vocabulary all words of sound and\r\nvision. Writing for other people, she should in many cases be true to\r\nouter fact rather than to her own experience. So long as she uses words\r\ncorrectly, she should be granted the privilege of using them freely, and\r\nnot be expected to confine herself to a vocabulary true to her lack of\r\nsight and hearing. In her style, as in what she writes about, we must\r\nconcede to the artist what we deny to the autobiographer. It should be\r\nexplained, too, that LOOK and SEE are used by the blind, and HEAR by the\r\ndeaf, for PERCEIVE; they are simple and more convenient words. Only\r\na literal person could think of holding the blind to PERCEPTION or\r\nAPPERCEPTION, when SEEING and LOOKING are so much easier, and have,\r\nmoreover, in the speech of all men the meaning of intellectual\r\nrecognition as well as recognition through the sense of sight. When Miss\r\nKeller examines a statue, she says in her natural idiom, as her fingers\r\nrun over the marble, "It looks like a head of Flora."\r\n\r\nIt is true, on the other hand, that in her descriptions, she is\r\nbest from the point of view of art when she is faithful to her own\r\nsensations; and this is precisely true of all artists.\r\n\r\nHer recent training has taught her to drop a good deal of her\r\nconventionality and to write about experiences in her life which are\r\npeculiar to her and which, like the storm in the wild cherry tree, mean\r\nmost and call for the truest phrasing. She has learned more and more to\r\ngive up the style she borrowed from books and tried to use, because she\r\nwanted to write like other people; she has learned that she is at her\r\nbest when she "feels" the lilies sway; lets the roses press into her\r\nhands and speaks of the heat which to her means light.\r\n\r\nMiss Keller\'s autobiography contains almost everything that she ever\r\nintended to publish. It seems worth while, however, to quote from some\r\nof her chance bits of writing, which are neither so informal as her\r\nletters nor so carefully composed as her story of her life. These\r\nextracts are from her exercises in her course in composition, where she\r\nshowed herself at the beginning of her college life quite without rival\r\namong her classmates. Mr. Charles T. Copeland, who has been for many\r\nyears instructor in English and Lecturer on English Literature at\r\nHarvard and Radcliffe, said to me: "In some of her work she has shown\r\nthat she can write better than any pupil I ever had, man or woman. She\r\nhas an excellent \'ear\' for the flow of sentences." The extracts follow:\r\n\r\nA few verses of Omar Khayyam\'s poetry have just been read to me, and I\r\nfeel as if I had spent the last half-hour in a magnificent sepulcher.\r\nYes, it is a tomb in which hope, joy and the power of acting nobly\r\nlie buried. Every beautiful description, every deep thought glides\r\ninsensibly into the same mournful chant of the brevity of life, of the\r\nslow decay and dissolution of all earthly things. The poet\'s bright,\r\nfond memories of love, youth and beauty are but the funeral torches\r\nshedding their light on this tomb, or to modify the image a little,\r\nthey are the flowers that bloom on it, watered with tears and fed by a\r\nbleeding heart. Beside the tomb sits a weary soul, rejoicing neither in\r\nthe joys of the past nor in the possibilities of the future, but seeking\r\nconsolation in forgetfulness. In vain the inspiring sea shouts to this\r\nlanguid soul, in vain the heavens strive with its weakness; it still\r\npersists in regretting and seeks a refuge in oblivion from the pangs\r\nof present woe. At times it catches some faint echo from the living,\r\njoyous, real world, a gleam of the perfection that is to be; and,\r\nthrilled out of its despondency, feels capable of working out a grand\r\nideal even "in the poor, miserable, hampered actual," wherein it is\r\nplaced; but in a moment the inspiration, the vision is gone, and\r\nthis great, much-suffering soul is again enveloped in the darkness of\r\nuncertainty and despair.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil. If\r\nthey would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow\r\nmen, the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui.\r\n\r\n\r\nI often think that beautiful ideas embarrass most people as much as\r\nthe company of great men. They are regarded generally as far more\r\nappropriate in books and in public discourses than in the parlor or at\r\nthe table. Of course I do not refer to beautiful sentiments, but to the\r\nhigher truths relating to everyday life. Few people that I know seem\r\never to pause in their daily intercourse to wonder at the beautiful bits\r\nof truth they have gathered during their years of study. Often when I\r\nspeak enthusiastically of something in history or in poetry, I receive\r\nno response, and I feel that I must change the subject and return to the\r\ncommonest topics, such as the weather, dressmaking, sports, sickness,\r\n"blues" and "worries." To be sure, I take the keenest interest in\r\neverything that concerns those who surround me; it is this very interest\r\nwhich makes it so difficult for me to carry on a conversation with some\r\npeople who will not talk or say what they think, but I should not be\r\nsorry to find more friends ready to talk with me now and then about the\r\nwonderful things I read. We need not be like "Les Femmes Savantes" but\r\nwe ought to have something to say about what we learn as well as about\r\nwhat we MUST do, and what our professors say or how they mark our\r\nthemes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day I took luncheon with the Freshman Class of Radcliffe. This was\r\nmy first real experience in college life, and a delightful experience\r\nit was! For the first time since my entrance into Radcliffe I had the\r\nopportunity to make friends with all my classmates, and the pleasure of\r\nknowing that they regarded me as one of themselves, instead of thinking\r\nof me as living apart and taking no interest in the everyday nothings\r\nof their life, as I had sometimes feared they did. I have often been\r\nsurprised to hear this opinion expressed or rather implied by girls of\r\nmy own age and even by people advanced in years. Once some one wrote to\r\nme that in his mind I was always "sweet and earnest," thinking only of\r\nwhat is wise, good and interesting--as if he thought I was one of those\r\nwearisome saints of whom there are only too many in the world! I always\r\nlaugh at these foolish notions, and assure my friends that it is much\r\nbetter to have a few faults and be cheerful and responsive in spite of\r\nall deprivations than to retire into one\'s shell, pet one\'s affliction,\r\nclothe it with sanctity, and then set one\'s self up as a monument of\r\npatience, virtue, goodness and all in all; but even while I laugh I feel\r\na twinge of pain in my heart, because it seems rather hard to me that\r\nany one should imagine that I do not feel the tender bonds which draw\r\nme to my young sisters--the sympathies springing from what we have in\r\ncommon--youth, hope, a half-eager, half-timid attitude towards the life\r\nbefore us and above all the royalty of maidenhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSainte-Beuve says, "Il vient un age peut-etre quand on n\'ecrit plus."\r\nThis is the only allusion I have read to the possibility that the\r\nsources of literature, varied and infinite as they seem now, may\r\nsometime be exhausted. It surprises me to find that such an idea has\r\ncrossed the mind of any one, especially of a highly gifted critic. The\r\nvery fact that the nineteenth century has not produced many authors\r\nwhom the world may count among the greatest of all time does not in my\r\nopinion justify the remark, "There may come a time when people cease to\r\nwrite."\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the fountains of literature are fed by two vast\r\nworlds, one of action, one of thought, by a succession of creations in\r\nthe one and of changes in the other. New experiences and events call\r\nforth new ideas and stir men to ask questions unthought of before, and\r\nseek a definite answer in the depths of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, if it is true that as many centuries must pass\r\nbefore the world becomes perfect as passed before it became what it\r\nis to-day, literature will surely be enriched incalculably by the\r\ntremendous changes, acquisitions and improvements that cannot fail\r\nto take place in the distant future. If genius has been silent for a\r\ncentury it has not been idle. On the contrary, it has been collecting\r\nfresh materials not only from the remote past, but also from the age of\r\nprogress and development, and perhaps in the new century there will\r\nbe outbursts of splendor in all the various branches of literature. At\r\npresent the world is undergoing a complete revolution, and in the\r\nmidst of falling systems and empires, conflicting theories and creeds,\r\ndiscoveries and inventions, it is a marvel how one can produce any great\r\nliterary works at all. This is an age of workers, not of thinkers. The\r\nsong to-day is:\r\n\r\nLet the dead past bury its dead, Act, act in the living present, Heart\r\nwithin and God overhead.\r\n\r\nA little later, when the rush and heat of achievement relax, we can\r\nbegin to expect the appearance of grand men to celebrate in glorious\r\npoetry and prose the deeds and triumphs of the last few centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to watch a plant grow, it is like taking part in\r\ncreation. When all outside is cold and white, when the little children\r\nof the woodland are gone to their nurseries in the warm earth, and the\r\nempty nests on the bare trees fill with snow, my window-garden glows and\r\nsmiles, making summer within while it is winter without. It is wonderful\r\nto see flowers bloom in the midst of a snow-storm! I have felt a bud\r\n"shyly doff her green hood and blossom with a silken burst of sound,"\r\nwhile the icy fingers of the snow beat against the window-panes. What\r\nsecret power, I wonder, caused this blossoming miracle? What mysterious\r\nforce guided the seedling from the dark earth up to the light, through\r\nleaf and stem and bud, to glorious fulfilment in the perfect flower? Who\r\ncould have dreamed that such beauty lurked in the dark earth, was latent\r\nin the tiny seed we planted? Beautiful flower, you have taught me to see\r\na little way into the hidden heart of things. Now I understand that the\r\ndarkness everywhere may hold possibilities better even than my hopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FREE TRANSLATION FROM HORACE BOOK II-18.\r\n\r\nI am not one of those on whom fortune deigns to smile. My house is not\r\nresplendent with ivory and gold; nor is it adorned with marble arches,\r\nresting on graceful columns brought from the quarries of distant\r\nAfrica. For me no thrifty spinners weave purple garments. I have not\r\nunexpectedly fallen heir to princely estates, titles or power; but I\r\nhave something more to be desired than all the world\'s treasures--the\r\nlove of my friends, and honorable fame, won by my own industry and\r\ntalents. Despite my poverty, it is my privilege to be the companion of\r\nthe rich and mighty. I am too grateful for all these blessings to wish\r\nfor more from princes, or from the gods. My little Sabine farm is dear\r\nto me; for here I spend my happiest days, far from the noise and strife\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nO, ye who live in the midst of luxury, who seek beautiful marbles for\r\nnew villas, that shall surpass the old in splendor, you never dream that\r\nthe shadow of death is hanging over your halls. Forgetful of the tomb,\r\nyou lay the foundation of your palaces. In your mad pursuit of pleasure\r\nyou rob the sea of its beach and desecrate hallowed ground. More even\r\nthan this, in your wickedness you destroy the peaceful homes of your\r\nclients! Without a touch of remorse you drive the father from his land,\r\nclasping to his bosom his household gods and his half-naked children.\r\n\r\nYou forget that death comes to the rich and the poor alike, and comes\r\nonce for all; but remember, Acheron could not be bribed by gold to ferry\r\nthe crafty Prometheus back to the sunlit world. Tantalus, too, great as\r\nhe was above all mortals, went down to the kingdom of the dead, never\r\nto return. Remember, too, that, although death is inexorable, yet he is\r\njust; for he brings retribution to the rich for their wickedness, and\r\ngives the poor eternal rest from their toil and sorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, the pranks that the nixies of Dreamland play on us while we sleep!\r\nMethinks "they are jesters at the Court of Heaven." They frequently take\r\nthe shape of daily themes to mock me; they strut about on the stage of\r\nSleep like foolish virgins, only they carry well-trimmed note-books\r\nin their hands instead of empty lamps. At other times they examine and\r\ncross-examine me in all the studies I have ever had, and invariably ask\r\nme questions as easy to answer as this: "What was the name of the first\r\nmouse that worried Hippopotamus, satrap of Cambridge under Astyagas,\r\ngrandfather of Cyrus the Great?" I wake terror-stricken with the words\r\nringing in my ears, "An answer or your life!"\r\n\r\nSuch are the distorted fancies that flit through the mind of one who is\r\nat college and lives as I do in an atmosphere of ideas, conceptions and\r\nhalf-thoughts, half-feelings which tumble and jostle each other until\r\none is almost crazy. I rarely have dreams that are not in keeping with\r\nwhat I really think and feel, but one night my very nature seemed to\r\nchange, and I stood in the eye of the world a mighty man and a terrible.\r\nNaturally I love peace and hate war and all that pertains to war; I see\r\nnothing admirable in the ruthless career of Napoleon, save its finish.\r\nNevertheless, in that dream the spirit of that pitiless slayer of men\r\nentered me! I shall never forget how the fury of battle throbbed in my\r\nveins--it seemed as if the tumultuous beating of my heart would stop my\r\nbreath. I rode a fiery hunter--I can feel the impatient toss of his head\r\nnow and the quiver that ran through him at the first roar of the cannon.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of the hill where I stood I saw my army surging over a\r\nsunlit plain like angry breakers, and as they moved, I saw the green of\r\nfields, like the cool hollows between billows. Trumpet answered trumpet\r\nabove the steady beat of drums and the rhythm of marching feet. I\r\nspurred my panting steed and waving my sword on high and shouting, "I\r\ncome! Behold me, warriors--Europe!" I plunged into the oncoming billows,\r\nas a strong swimmer dives into breakers, and struck, alas, \'tis true,\r\nthe bedpost!\r\n\r\nNow I rarely sleep without dreaming; but before Miss Sullivan came to\r\nme, my dreams were few and far between, devoid of thought or coherency,\r\nexcept those of a purely physical nature. In my dreams something was\r\nalways falling suddenly and heavily, and at times my nurse seemed to\r\npunish me for my unkind treatment of her in the daytime and return at an\r\nusurer\'s rate of interest my kickings and pinchings. I would wake with\r\na start or struggle frantically to escape from my tormentor. I was very\r\nfond of bananas, and one night I dreamed that I found a long string of\r\nthem in the dining-room, near the cupboard, all peeled and deliciously\r\nripe, and all I had to do was to stand under the string and eat as long\r\nas I could eat.\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Sullivan came to me, the more I learned, the oftener I\r\ndreamed; but with the waking of my mind there came many dreary fancies\r\nand vague terrors which troubled my sleep for a long time. I dreaded the\r\ndarkness and loved the woodfire. Its warm touch seemed so like a human\r\ncaress, I really thought it was a sentient being, capable of loving\r\nand protecting me. One cold winter night I was alone in my room. Miss\r\nSullivan had put out the light and gone away, thinking I was sound\r\nasleep. Suddenly I felt my bed shake, and a wolf seemed to spring on me\r\nand snarl in my face. It was only a dream, but I thought it real, and my\r\nheart sank within me. I dared not scream, and I dared not stay in bed.\r\nPerhaps this was a confused recollection of the story I had heard not\r\nlong before about Red Riding Hood. At all events, I slipped down from\r\nthe bed and nestled close to the fire which had not flickered out.\r\nThe instant I felt its warmth I was reassured, and I sat a long time\r\nwatching it climb higher and higher in shining waves. At last sleep\r\nsurprised me, and when Miss Sullivan returned she found me wrapped in a\r\nblanket by the hearth.\r\n\r\nOften when I dream, thoughts pass through my mind like cowled shadows,\r\nsilent and remote, and disappear. Perhaps they are the ghosts of\r\nthoughts that once inhabited the mind of an ancestor. At other times the\r\nthings I have learned and the things I have been taught, drop away, as\r\nthe lizard sheds its skin, and I see my soul as God sees it. There are\r\nalso rare and beautiful moments when I see and hear in Dreamland. What\r\nif in my waking hours a sound should ring through the silent halls\r\nof hearing? What if a ray of light should flash through the darkened\r\nchambers of my soul? What would happen, I ask many and many a time.\r\nWould the bow-and-string tension of life snap? Would the heart,\r\noverweighted with sudden joy, stop beating for very excess of happiness?\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF MY LIFE ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
