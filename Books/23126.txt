Farrar.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nThis famous book tells the story of a boy at a boarding school on the\r\nIsle of Man, which lies between England and Ireland, and within sight of\r\nScotland.  The boy succumbs to various forms of ill-behaviour, with\r\nillicit trips to a bar in the near-by town.  There are various scary\r\nepisodes.  Overcome with shame at something he has done Eric runs away\r\nto sea, which he finds so horrible an experience that when he is next in\r\nEngland he jumps ship, makes his way home, by now very ill, and dies.\r\n\r\nAuthor\'s Preface (Farrar was Headmaster of Marlborough College).\r\n\r\nThe story of `Eric\' was written with but one single object--the vivid\r\ninculcation of inward purity and moral purpose, by the history of a boy\r\nwho, in spite of the inherent nobleness of his disposition, falls into\r\nall folly and wickedness, until he has learnt to seek help from above. I\r\nam deeply thankful to know--from testimony public and private,\r\nanonymous and acknowledged--that this object has, by God\'s blessing,\r\nbeen fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe fact that new editions are still called for thirty-one years after\r\nits publication, shows, I trust, that the story has been found to be of\r\nreal use. I have not thought it right to alter in any way the style or\r\nstructure of the narrative, but I have so far revised it as to remove a\r\nfew of the minor blemishes. I trust that the book may continue to live\r\nso long--and so long only--as it may prove to be a source of moral\r\nbenefit to those who read it.\r\n\r\nApril 21, 1889.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\nERIC, OR LITTLE BY LITTLE, BY REV CANON F.W. FARRAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\n  Ah dear delights, that o\'er my soul\r\n  On memory\'s wing like shadows fly!\r\n  Ah flowers that Joy from Eden stole,\r\n  While Innocence stood laughing by.\r\n  _Coleridge_.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!" cried a young boy, as he capered vigorously\r\nabout, and clapped his hands.  "Father and mother will be home in a week\r\nnow, and then we shall stay here a little time, and _then_, and _then_,\r\nI shall go to school."\r\n\r\nThe last words were enunciated with immense importance, as he stopped\r\nhis impromptu dance before the chair where his sober cousin Fanny was\r\npatiently working at her crochet; but she did not look so much affected\r\nby the announcement as the boy seemed to demand, so he again exclaimed,\r\n"And then, Miss Fanny, I shall go to school."\r\n\r\n"Well, Eric," said Fanny, raising her matter-of-fact quiet face from her\r\nendless work, "I doubt, dear, whether you will talk of it with quite as\r\nmuch joy a year hence."\r\n\r\n"Oh ay, Fanny, that\'s just like you to say so; you\'re always talking and\r\nprophesying; but never mind, I\'m going to school, so, hurrah! hurrah!\r\nhurrah!" and he again began his capering,--jumping over the chairs,\r\ntrying to vault the tables, singing and dancing with an exuberance of\r\ndelight, till, catching a sudden sight of his little spaniel Flo, he\r\nsprang through the open window into the garden, and disappeared behind\r\nthe trees of the shrubbery; but Fanny still heard his clear, ringing,\r\nsilvery laughter, as he continued his games in the summer air.\r\n\r\nShe looked up from her work after he had gone, and sighed.  In spite of\r\nthe sunshine and balm of the bright weather, a sense of heaviness and\r\nforeboding oppressed her.  Everything looked smiling and beautiful, and\r\nthere was an almost irresistible contagion in the mirth of her young\r\ncousin, but still she could not help feeling sad.  It was not merely\r\nthat she would have to part with Eric, "but that bright boy," thought\r\nFanny, "what will become of him?  I have heard strange things of\r\nschools; oh, if he should be spoilt and ruined, what misery it would be.\r\nThose baby lips, that pure young heart, a year may work sad change in\r\ntheir words and thoughts!"  She sighed again, and her eyes glistened as\r\nshe raised them upwards, and breathed a silent prayer.\r\n\r\nShe loved the boy dearly, and had taught him from his earliest years.\r\nIn most things she found him an apt pupil.  Truthful, ingenuous, quick,\r\nhe would acquire almost without effort any subject that interested him,\r\nand a word was often enough to bring the impetuous blood to his cheeks,\r\nin a flush of pride or indignation.  He required the gentlest teaching,\r\nand had received it, while his mind seemed cast in such a mould of\r\nstainless honour, that he avoided most of the weaknesses to which\r\nchildren are prone.  But he was far from blameless.  He was proud to a\r\nfault; he well knew that few of his fellows had gifts like his, either\r\nof mind or person, and his fair face often showed a clear impression of\r\nhis own superiority.  His passion, too, was imperious, and though it\r\nalways met with prompt correction, his cousin had latterly found it\r\ndifficult to subdue.  She felt, in a word, that he was outgrowing her\r\nrule.  Beyond a certain age no boy of spirit can be safely guided by a\r\nwoman\'s hand alone.\r\n\r\nEric Williams was now twelve years old.  His father was a civilian in\r\nIndia, and was returning on furlough to England, after a long absence.\r\nEric had been born in India, but had been sent to England by his parents\r\nat an early age, in charge of a lady friend of his mother.  The parting,\r\nwhich had been agony to his father and mother, he was too young to feel;\r\nindeed the moment itself passed by without his being conscious of it.\r\nThey took him on board the ship, and, after a time, gave him a hammer\r\nand some nails to play with.  These had always been to him a supreme\r\ndelight, and while he hammered away, Mr and Mrs Williams, denying\r\nthemselves, for the child\'s sake, even one more tearful embrace, went\r\nashore in the boat and left him.  It was not till the ship sailed that\r\nhe was told he would not see them again for a long, long time.  Poor\r\nchild, his tears and cries were piteous when he first understood it; but\r\nthe sorrows of four years old are very transient, and before a week was\r\nover, little Eric felt almost reconciled to his position, and had become\r\nthe universal pet and plaything of every one on board, from Captain\r\nBroadland down to the cabin-boy, with whom he very soon struck up an\r\nacquaintance.  Yet twice a day at least his mirth would be checked as he\r\nlisped his little prayer, kneeling at Mrs Munro\'s knee, and asked God\r\n"to bless his dear, dear father and mother, and make him a good boy."\r\n\r\nWhen Eric arrived in England, he was entrusted to the care of a widowed\r\naunt, whose daughter, Fanny, had the main charge of his early teaching.\r\nAt first, the wayward little Indian seemed likely to form no accession\r\nto the quiet household, but he soon became its brightest ornament and\r\npride.  Everything was in his favour at the pleasant home of Mrs\r\nTrevor.  He was treated with motherly kindness and tenderness, yet\r\nfirmly checked when he went wrong.  From the first he had a well-spring\r\nof strength against temptation, in the long letters which every mail\r\nbrought from his parents; and all his childish affections were entwined\r\nround the fancied image of a brother born since he had left India.  In\r\nhis bedroom there hung a cherub\'s head, drawn in pencil by his mother,\r\nand this winged child was inextricably identified in his imagination\r\nwith his "little brother Vernon."  He loved it dearly, and whenever he\r\nwent astray, nothing weighed on his mind so strongly as the thought,\r\nthat if he were naughty he would teach little Vernon to be naughty too\r\nwhen he came home.\r\n\r\nAnd Nature also--wisest, gentlest, holiest of teachers--was with him in\r\nhis childhood.  Fairholm Cottage, where his aunt lived, was situated in\r\nthe beautiful Vale of Ayrton, and a clear stream ran through the valley\r\nat the bottom of Mrs Trevor\'s orchard.  Eric loved this stream, and was\r\nalways happy as he roamed by its side, or over the low green hills and\r\nscattered dingles which lent unusual loveliness to every winding of its\r\nwaters.  He was allowed to go about a good deal by himself, and it did\r\nhim good.  He grew up fearless and self-dependent, and never felt the\r\nwant of amusement.  The garden and orchard supplied him a theatre for\r\nendless games and romps, sometimes with no other companion than his\r\ncousin and his dog, and sometimes with the few children of his own age\r\nwhom he knew in the hamlet.  Very soon he forgot all about India; it\r\nonly hung like a distant golden haze on the horizon of his memory.  When\r\nasked if he remembered it, he would say thoughtfully, that in dreams and\r\nat some other times, he saw a little boy, with long curly hair, running\r\nabout in a flower-garden, near a great river, in a place where the air\r\nwas very bright.  But whether the little boy was himself or his brother\r\nVernon, whom he had never seen, he couldn\'t quite tell.\r\n\r\nBut, above all, it was happy for Eric that his training was religious\r\nand enlightened.  With Mrs Trevor and her daughter, religion was not a\r\nsystem but a habit--not a theory but a continued act of life.  All was\r\nsimple, sweet, and unaffected, about their charity and their devotions.\r\nThey loved God, and they did all the good they could to those around\r\nthem.  The floating gossip and ill-nature of the little village never\r\naffected them; it melted away insensibly in the presence of their\r\ncultivated minds; so that friendship with them was a bond of union among\r\nall, and from the vicar to the dairyman every one loved and respected\r\nthem, asked their counsel, and sought their sympathy.\r\n\r\nThey called themselves by no sectarian name, nor could they have told to\r\nwhat "party" they belonged.  They troubled themselves with no theories\r\nof education, but mingled gentle nurture with "wholesome neglect."\r\nThere was nothing exotic or constrained in the growth of Eric\'s\r\ncharacter.  He was not one of the angelically good children at all, and\r\nknew none of the phrases of which infant prodigies are supposed to be so\r\nfond.  But to be truthful, to be honest, to be kind, to be brave, these\r\nlessons had been taught him, and he never _quite_ forgot them; nor amid\r\nthe sorrows of after life did he ever quite lose the sense--learnt at\r\ndear quiet Fairholm--of a present loving God, of a tender and\r\nlong-suffering Father.\r\n\r\nAs yet he could be hardly said to know what school was.  He had been\r\nsent indeed to Mr Lawley\'s grammar school for the last half-year, and\r\nhad learned a few declensions in his Latin grammar.  But as Mr Lawley\r\nallowed his upper class to hear the little boys their lessons, Eric had\r\nmanaged to get on pretty much as he liked.  Only _once_ in the entire\r\nhalf-year had he said a lesson to the dreadful master himself, and of\r\ncourse it was a ruinous failure, involving some tremendous pulls of\r\nEric\'s hair, and making him tremble like a leaf.  Several things\r\ncombined to make Mr Lawley terrific to his imagination.  Ever since he\r\nwas quite little, he remembered hearing the howls which proceeded from\r\nthe "Latin-school" as he passed by, whilst some luckless youngster was\r\ngetting caned; and the reverend pedagogue was notoriously passionate.\r\nThen, again, he spoke so indistinctly with his deep gruff voice, that\r\nEric never could and never did understand a word he said, and this kept\r\nhim in a perpetual terror.\r\n\r\nOnce Mr Lawley had told him to go out, and see what time it was by the\r\nchurch clock.\r\n\r\nOnly hearing that he was to do something, too frightened to ask what it\r\nwas, and feeling sure that even if he did, he should not make out what\r\nthe master meant, Eric ran out, went straight to Mr Lawley\'s house,\r\nand, after having managed by strenuous jumps to touch the knocker,\r\ninformed the servant "that Mr Lawley wanted his man."\r\n\r\n"What man?" said the maid-servant, "the young man? or the butler? or is\r\nit the clerk?"\r\n\r\nHere was a puzzler! all Eric knew was, that he was in the habit of\r\nsending sometimes for one or other of these functionaries; but he was in\r\nfor it, so with a faltering voice he said "the young man" at hazard, and\r\nwent back to the Latin-school.\r\n\r\n"Why have you been so long?" roared Mr Lawley, as he timidly entered.\r\n\r\nFear entirely prevented Eric from hearing the exact question, so he\r\nanswered at random, "He\'s coming, sir."  The master seeing by his scared\r\nlook that something was wrong, waited to see what would turn up.\r\n\r\nSoon after in walked "the young man," and coming to the astonished Mr\r\nLawley, bowed, scraped, and said, "Master Williams said you sent for me,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"A mistake," growled the schoolmaster, turning on Eric a look which\r\nnearly petrified him; he quite expected a book at his head, or at best a\r\ngreat whack of the cane; but Mr Lawley had naturally a kind heart,\r\nsoured as it was, and pitying perhaps the child\'s white face, he\r\ncontented himself with the effects of his look.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth was, that poor Mr Lawley was a little wrong in the\r\nhead.  A scholar and a gentleman, early misfortunes and an imprudent\r\nmarriage had driven him to the mastership of the little country grammar\r\nschool; and here the perpetual annoyance caused to his refined mind by\r\nthe coarseness of clumsy or spiteful boys, had gradually unhinged his\r\nintellect.  Often did he tell the boys "that it was an easier life by\r\nfar to break stones by the roadside than to teach them;" and at last his\r\neccentricities became too obvious to be any longer overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe denouement of his history was a tragic one, and had come a few days\r\nbefore the time when our narrative opens.  It was a common practice\r\namong the Latin-school boys, as I suppose among all boys, to amuse\r\nthemselves by putting a heavy book on the top of a door left partially\r\najar, and to cry out, "Crown him!" as the first luckless youngster who\r\nhappened to come in received the book thundering on his head.  One day,\r\njust as the trap had been adroitly laid, Mr Lawley walked in\r\nunexpectedly.  The moment he entered the schoolroom, down came an\r\nAinsworth\'s Dictionary on the top of his hat, and the boy, concealed\r\nbehind the door, unconscious of who the victim was, enunciated with mock\r\ngravity, "Crown him, three cheers!"\r\n\r\nIt took Mr Lawley a second to raise from his eyebrows the battered hat,\r\nand recover from his confusion; the next instant he was springing after\r\nthe boy who had caused the mishap, and who, knowing the effects of the\r\nmaster\'s fury, fled with precipitation.  In one minute the offender was\r\ncaught, and Mr Lawley\'s heavy hand fell recklessly on his ears and\r\nback, until he screamed with terror.  At last, by a tremendous writhe,\r\nwrenching himself free, he darted towards the door, and Mr Lawley, too\r\nmuch tired to pursue, snatched his large gold watch out of his fob, and\r\nhurled it at the boy\'s retreating figure.  The watch flew through the\r\nair;--crash! it had missed its aim, and, striking the wall above the\r\nlintel, fell smashed into a thousand shivers.\r\n\r\nThe sound, the violence of the action, the sight of the broken watch,\r\nwhich was the gift of a cherished friend, instantly awoke the master to\r\nhis senses.  The whole school had seen it; they sate there pale and\r\nbreathless with excitement and awe.  The poor man could bear it no\r\nlonger.  He flung himself into his chair, hid his face with his hands,\r\nand burst into hysterical tears.  It was the outbreak of feelings long\r\npent-up.  In that instant all his life passed before him--its hopes, its\r\nfailures, its miseries, its madness.  "Yes!" he thought, "I am mad."\r\n\r\nRaising his head, he cried wildly, "Boys, go, I am mad!" and sank again\r\ninto his former position, rocking himself to and fro.  One by one the\r\nboys stole out, and he was left alone.  The end is soon told.  Forced to\r\nleave Ayrton, he had no means of earning his daily bread; and the weight\r\nof this new anxiety hastening the crisis, the handsome proud scholar\r\nbecame an inmate of the Brerely Lunatic Asylum.  A few years afterwards,\r\nEric heard that he was dead.  Poor broken human heart! may he rest in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nSuch was Eric\'s first school and schoolmaster.  But although he learnt\r\nlittle there, and gained no experience of the character of others or of\r\nhis own, yet there was one point about Ayrton Latin-School which he\r\nnever regretted.  It was the mixture there of all classes.  On those\r\nbenches gentlemen\'s sons sat side by side with plebeians, and no harm,\r\nbut only good, seemed to come from the intercourse.  The neighbouring\r\ngentry, most of whom had begun their education there, were drawn into\r\ncloser and kindlier union with their neighbours and dependants, from the\r\nfact of having been their associates in the days of their boyhood.  Many\r\na time afterwards, when Eric, as he passed down the streets,\r\ninterchanged friendly greetings with some young glazier or tradesman\r\nwhom he remembered at school, he felt glad that thus early he had learnt\r\npractically to despise the accidental and nominal differences which\r\nseparate man from man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nA NEW HOME.\r\n\r\n  Life hath its May, and all is joyous then\r\n  The woods are vocal, and the flowers breathe odour,\r\n  The very breeze hath mirth in\'t.\r\n  _Old Play_.\r\n\r\nAT last the longed-for yet dreaded day approached, and a letter informed\r\nthe Trevors that Mr and Mrs Williams would arrive at Southampton on\r\n5th July, and would probably reach Ayrton the evening after.  They\r\nparticularly requested that no one should come to meet them on their\r\nlanding.  "We shall reach Southampton," wrote Mrs Williams, "tired,\r\npale, and travel-stained, and had much rather see you first at Fairholm,\r\nwhere we shall be spared the painful constraint of a meeting in public.\r\nSo please expect our arrival at about seven in the evening."\r\n\r\nPoor Eric! although he had been longing for the time ever since the news\r\ncame, yet now he was too agitated for enjoyment.  Exertion and\r\nexpectation made him restless, and he could settle down to nothing all\r\nday, every hour of which hung most heavily on his hands.\r\n\r\nAt last the afternoon wore away, and a soft summer evening filled the\r\nsky with its gorgeous calm.  Far-off they caught the sound of wheels; a\r\ncarriage dashed up to the door, and the next moment Eric sprang into his\r\nmother\'s arms.\r\n\r\n"O mother! mother!"\r\n\r\n"My own darling, darling boy!"\r\n\r\nAnd as the pale sweet face of the mother met the bright and rosy\r\nchild-face, each of them was wet with a rush of unbidden tears.  In\r\nanother moment Eric had been folded to his father\'s heart, and locked in\r\nthe arms of his little brother Vernon.  Who shall describe the emotions\r\nof those few moments? they did not seem like earthly moments; they\r\nseemed to belong not to time, but to eternity.\r\n\r\nThe first evening of such a scene is too excited to be happy.  The\r\nlittle party at Fairholm retired early, and Eric was soon fast asleep\r\nwith his arm round his new-found brother\'s neck.\r\n\r\nQuiet steps entered the chamber, and noiselessly the father and mother\r\nsat down by the bedside of their children.  Earth could have shown no\r\nscene more perfect in its beauty than that which met their eyes.  The\r\npure moonlight flooded the little room, and showed distinctly the forms\r\nand countenances of the sleepers, whose soft regular breathing was the\r\nonly sound that broke the stillness of the July night.  The small\r\nshining flower-like faces, with their fair hair--the trustful loving\r\narms folded round each brother\'s neck--the closed lids and parted lips--\r\nmade an exquisite picture, and one never to be forgotten.  Side by side,\r\nwithout a word, the parents knelt down, and with eyes wet with tears of\r\njoyfulness, poured out their hearts in passionate prayer for their young\r\nand beloved boys.\r\n\r\nVery happily the next month glided away; a new life seemed opened to\r\nEric in the world of rich affections which had unfolded itself before\r\nhim.  His parents--above all, his mother--were everything that he had\r\nlonged for; and Vernon more than fulfilled to his loving heart the ideal\r\nof his childish fancy.  He was never tired of playing with and\r\npatronising his little brother, and their rambles by stream and hill\r\nmade those days appear the happiest he had ever spent.  Every evening\r\n(for having lived all his life at home, he had not yet laid aside the\r\nhabits of early childhood) he said his prayers by his mother\'s knee; and\r\nat the end of one long summer\'s day, when prayers were finished, and\r\nfull of life and happiness he lay down to sleep, "Oh, mother," he said,\r\n"I am so happy--I like to say my prayers when you are here."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my boy, and God loves to hear them."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t there some who never say prayers, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Very many, love, I fear."\r\n\r\n"How unhappy they must be!  _I_ shall _always_ love to say my prayers."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Eric, God grant that you may."\r\n\r\nAnd the fond mother hoped he always would.  But these words often came\r\nback to Eric\'s mind in later and less happy days--days when that gentle\r\nhand could no longer rest lovingly on his head--when those mild blue\r\neyes were dim with tears, and the poor boy, changed in heart and life,\r\noften flung himself down with an unreproaching conscience to prayer-less\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nIt had been settled that in another week Eric was to go to school in the\r\nIsle of Roslyn.  Mr Williams had hired a small house in the town of\r\nEllan, and intended to stay there for his year of furlough, at the end\r\nof which period Vernon was to be left at Fairholm, and Eric in the house\r\nof the head-master of the school.  Eric enjoyed the prospect of all\r\nthings, and he hardly fancied that Paradise itself could be happier than\r\na life at the sea-side with his father and mother and Vernon, combined\r\nwith the commencement of schoolboy dignity.  When the time for the\r\nvoyage came, his first glimpse of the sea, and the sensation of sailing\r\nover it with only a few planks between him and the deep waters, struck\r\nhim silent with admiring wonder.  It was a cloudless day; the line of\r\nblue sky melted into the line of blue wave, and the air was filled with\r\nsunlight.  At evening they landed, and the coach took them to Ellan.  On\r\nthe way Eric saw for the first time the strength of the hills, so that\r\nwhen they reached the town and took possession of their cottage, he was\r\ndumb with the inrush of new and marvellous impressions.\r\n\r\nNext morning he was awake early, and jumping out of bed, so as not to\r\ndisturb the sleeping Vernon, he drew up the window-blind, and gently\r\nopened the window.  A very beautiful scene burst on him, one destined to\r\nbe long mingled with all his most vivid reminiscences.  It had been too\r\ndark on their arrival the evening before to get any definite impression\r\nof their residence, so that this first glimpse of it filled him with\r\ndelighted surprise.  Not twenty yards below the garden, in front of the\r\nhouse, lay Ellan Bay, at that moment rippling with golden laughter in\r\nthe fresh breeze of sunrise.  On either side of the bay was a bold\r\nheadland, the one stretching out in a series of broken crags, the other\r\nterminating in a huge mass of rock, called from its shape The Stack.  To\r\nthe right lay the town, with its grey old castle, and the mountain\r\nstream running through it into the sea; to the left, high above the\r\nbeach, rose the crumbling fragment of a picturesque fort, behind which\r\ntowered the lofty buildings of Roslyn School.  Eric learnt the whole\r\nlandscape by heart, and thought himself a most happy boy to come to such\r\na place.  He fancied that he should never be tired of looking at the\r\nsea, and could not take his eyes off the great buoy that rolled about in\r\nthe centre of the bay, and flashed in the sunlight at every move.  He\r\nturned round full of hope and spirits, and, after watching for a few\r\nmoments the beautiful face of his sleeping brother, awoke him with\r\nboisterous mirth.\r\n\r\n"Now, Verny," he cried, as the little boy sprang eagerly out of bed,\r\n"don\'t look till I tell you," and putting his hands over Vernon\'s eyes,\r\nhe led him to the window.  Then he threw up the sash, and embodied all\r\nhis sensations in the one word--"There!"\r\n\r\nTo which apostrophe Vernon, after a long gaze, could make no other\r\nanswer than, "Oh, Eric! oh, I say!"\r\n\r\nThat day Eric was to have his first interview with Dr Rowlands.  The\r\nschool had already re-opened, and one of the boys passed by the window\r\nwhile they were breakfasting.  He looked very happy and engaging, and\r\nwas humming a tune as he strolled along.  Eric started up and gazed\r\nafter him with the most intense curiosity.  At that moment the\r\nunconscious schoolboy was to him the most interesting person in the\r\nwhole world, and he couldn\'t realise the fact that, before the day was\r\nover, he would be a Roslyn boy himself.  He very much wondered what sort\r\nof a fellow the boy was, and whether he should ever recognise him again,\r\nand make his acquaintance.  Yes, Eric, the thread of that boy\'s destiny\r\nis twined for many a day with yours; his name is Montagu, as you will\r\nknow very soon.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock Mr Williams started towards the school with his son.\r\nThe walk led them by the sea-side, over the sands, and past the ruin, at\r\nthe foot of which the waves broke at high tide.  At any other time Eric\r\nwould have been overflowing with life and wonder at the murmur of the\r\nripples, the sight of the ships in the bay or on the horizon, and the\r\nnumberless little shells, with their bright colours and sculptured\r\nshapes, which lay about the beach.  But now his mind was too full of a\r\nsingle anxiety; and when, after crossing a green playground, they stood\r\nby the head-master\'s door, his heart fluttered, and it required all his\r\nenergy to keep down the nervous trembling which shook him.\r\n\r\nMr Williams gave his card, and they were shown into Dr Rowlands\'s\r\nstudy.  He was a kind-looking gentlemanly man, and when he turned to\r\naddress Eric, after a few minutes\' conversation with his father, the boy\r\nfelt instantly reassured by the pleasant sincerity and frank courtesy of\r\nhis manner.  A short examination showed that Eric\'s attainments were\r\nvery slight as yet, and he was to be put in the lowest form of all,\r\nunder the superintendence of the Reverend Henry Gordon.  Dr Rowlands\r\nwrote a short note in pencil, and giving it to Eric, directed the\r\nservant to show him to Mr Gordon\'s schoolroom.\r\n\r\nThe bell had just done ringing when they had started for the school, so\r\nthat Eric knew that all the boys would be by this time assembled at\r\ntheir work, and that he should have to go alone into the middle of them.\r\nAs he walked after the servant through the long corridors and up the\r\nbroad stairs, he longed to make friends with him, so as, if possible, to\r\nfeel less lonely.  But he had only time to get out, "I say, what sort of\r\na fellow is Mr Gordon?"\r\n\r\n"Terrible strict, sir, I hear," said the man, touching his cap with a\r\ncomic expression, which didn\'t at all tend to enliven the future pupil.\r\n"That\'s the door," he continued, "and you\'ll have to give him the\r\nDoctor\'s note," and, pointing to a door at the end of the passage, he\r\nwalked off.\r\n\r\nEric stopped irresolutely.  The man had disappeared, and he was by\r\nhimself in the great silent building.  Afraid of the sound of his own\r\nfootsteps, he ran along the passage, and knocked timidly.  He heard a\r\nlow, a very low murmur in the room, but there was no answer.  He knocked\r\nagain a little louder; still no notice; then, overdoing it in his\r\nfright, he gave a very loud tap indeed.\r\n\r\n"Come in!" said a voice, which to the new boy sounded awful; but he\r\nopened the door, and entered.  As he came in every head was quickly\r\nraised, he heard a whisper of "New fellow," and the crimson flooded\r\nhis face, as he felt himself the cynosure of some forty\r\nintensely-inquisitive pairs of eyes.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a high airy room, with three large windows opening\r\ntowards the sea.  At one end was the master\'s throne, and facing it, all\r\ndown the room, were desks and benches, along which the boys were sitting\r\nat work.  Every one knows how very confusing it is to enter a strange\r\nroom full of strange people, and especially when you enter it from a\r\ndarker passage.  Eric felt dazzled, and not seeing the regular route to\r\nthe master\'s desk, went towards it between two of the benches.  As these\r\nwere at no great distance from each other, he stumbled against several\r\nlegs on his way, and felt pretty sure that they were put out on purpose\r\nto trip him, especially by one boy, who pretended to be much hurt, drew\r\nup his leg, and began rubbing it, ejaculating _sotto voce_, "Awkward\r\nlittle fool."\r\n\r\nIn this very clumsy way he had at last reached the desk, and presented\r\nhis missive.  The master\'s eye was on him, but all Eric had time to\r\nobserve was, that he looked rather stern, and had in his hand a book\r\nwhich he seemed to be studying with the deepest interest.  He glanced\r\nfirst at the note, and then looked full at the boy, as though determined\r\nto read his whole character by a single perusal of his face.\r\n\r\n"Williams, I suppose?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," said Eric, very low, still painfully conscious that all the\r\nboys were looking at him, as well as the master.\r\n\r\n"Very well, Williams, you are placed in the lowest form--the fourth.  I\r\nhope you will work well.  At present they are learning their Caesar.  Go\r\nand sit next to that boy," pointing towards the lower end of the room;\r\n"he will show you the lesson, and let you look over his book.  Barker,\r\nlet Williams look over you!"\r\n\r\nEric went and sat down at the end of a bench by the boy indicated.  He\r\nwas a rough-looking fellow with a shock head of black hair, and a very\r\ndogged look.  Eric secretly thought that he a very nice-looking specimen\r\nof Roslyn School.  However, he sate by him, and glanced at the Caesar\r\nwhich the boy shoved about a quarter of an inch in his direction.  But\r\nBarker didn\'t seem inclined to make any further advances, and presently\r\nEric asked in a whisper--\r\n\r\n"What\'s the lesson?"\r\n\r\nThe boy glanced at him, but took no further notice.\r\n\r\nEric repeated, "I say, what\'s the lesson?"\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, Barker stared at him, and grunted--\r\n\r\n"What\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Eric--I mean Williams."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t you say what you mean?"  Eric moved his foot impatiently\r\nat this ungracious reception; but as he seemed to have no redress, he\r\npulled the Caesar nearer towards him.\r\n\r\n"Drop that; \'tisn\'t yours."\r\n\r\nMr Gordon heard a whisper, and glanced that way.  "Silence!" he said,\r\nand Barker pretended to be deep in his work, while Eric, resigning\r\nhimself to his fate, looked about him.\r\n\r\nHe had plenty to occupy his attention in the faces round him.  He\r\nfurtively examined Mr Gordon, as he bent over his high desk, writing,\r\nbut couldn\'t make out the physiognomy.  There had been something\r\nreserved and imperious in the master\'s manner, yet he thought he should\r\nnot dislike him on the whole.  With the countenances of his future\r\nschool-fellows he was not altogether pleased, but there were one or two\r\nwhich thoroughly attracted him.  One boy, whose side face was turned\r\ntowards him as he sat on the bench in front, took his fancy\r\nparticularly, so, tired of doing nothing, he plucked up courage, and\r\nleaning forward, whispered, "Do lend me your Caesar for a few minutes."\r\nThe boy at once handed it to him with a pleasant smile, and as the\r\nlesson was marked, Eric had time to hurry over a few sentences, when Mr\r\nGordon\'s sonorous voice exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"Fourth-form, come up!"\r\n\r\nSome twenty of the boys went up, and stood in a large semicircle round\r\nthe desk.  Eric of course was placed last, and the lesson commenced.\r\n\r\n"Russell, begin," said the master; and immediately the boy who had\r\nhanded Eric his Caesar began reading a few sentences, and construed them\r\nvery creditably, only losing a place or two.  He had a frank open face,\r\nbright intelligent fearless eyes, and a very taking voice and manner.\r\nEric listened admiringly, and felt sure he should like him.\r\n\r\nBarker was put on next.  He bungled through the Latin in a grating,\r\nirresolute sort of way, with several false quantities, for each of which\r\nthe next boy took him up.  Then he began to construe;--a frightful\r\nconfusion of nominatives without verbs, accusatives translated as\r\nablatives, and adverbs turned into prepositions, ensued, and after a\r\nhopeless flounder, during which Mr Gordon left him entirely to himself,\r\nBarker came to a full stop; his catastrophe was so ludicrous, that Eric\r\ncould not help joining in the general titter.  Barker scowled.\r\n\r\n"As usual, Barker," said the master, with a curl of the lip.  "Hold out\r\nyour hand!"\r\n\r\nBarker did so, looking sullen defiance, and the cane immediately\r\ndescended on his open palm.  Six similar cuts followed, during which the\r\nform looked on, not without terror; and Barker, squeezing his hands\r\ntight together, went back to his seat.\r\n\r\n"Williams, translate the piece in which Barker has just failed."\r\n\r\nEric did as he was bid, and got through it pretty well.  He had now\r\nquite recovered his ordinary bearing, and spoke out clearly and without\r\nnervousness.  He afterwards won several places by answering questions,\r\nand at the end of the lesson was marked about half-way up the form.  The\r\nboys\' numbers were then taken down in the weekly register, and they went\r\nback to their seats.\r\n\r\nOn his desk Eric found a torn bit of paper, on which was clumsily\r\nscrawled, "I\'ll teach you to grin when I\'m turned, you young brute."\r\n\r\nThe paper seemed to fascinate his eyes.  He stared at it fixedly, and\r\naugured ominously of Barker\'s intentions, since that worthy obviously\r\nalluded to his having smiled in form, and chose to interpret it as an\r\nintentional provocation.  He felt that he was in for it, and that Barker\r\nmeant to pick a quarrel with him.  This puzzled and annoyed him, and he\r\nfelt very sad to have found an enemy already.\r\n\r\nWhile he was looking at the paper the great school-clock struck twelve;\r\nand the captain of the form getting up, threw open the folding doors of\r\nthe schoolroom.\r\n\r\n"You may go," said Mr Gordon; and leaving his seat, disappeared by a\r\ndoor at the farther end of the room.\r\n\r\nInstantly there was a rush for caps, and the boys poured out in a\r\nconfused and noisy stream, while at the same moment the other\r\nschoolrooms disgorged their inmates.  Eric naturally went out among the\r\nlast; but just as he was going to take his cap, Barker seized it, and\r\nflung it with a whoop to the end of the passage, where it was trampled\r\non by a number of the boys as they ran out.\r\n\r\nEric, gulping down his fury with a great effort, turned to his opponent,\r\nand said coolly, "Is that what you always do to new fellows?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, you bumptious young owl, it is, and that too;" and a tolerably\r\nsmart slap on the face followed--leaving a red mark on a cheek already\r\naflame with anger and indignation,--"should you like a little more?"\r\n\r\nHe was hurt and offended, but was too proud to cry.  "What\'s that for?"\r\nhe said, with flashing eyes.\r\n\r\n"For your conceit in laughing at me when I was caned."\r\n\r\nEric stamped.  "I did nothing of the kind, and you know it as well as I\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n"What?  I\'m a liar, am I?  Oh, we shall take this kind of thing out of\r\nyou, you young cub; take that;" and a heavier blow followed.\r\n\r\n"You brutal cowardly bully," shouted Eric; and in another moment he\r\nwould have sprung upon him.  It was lucky for him that he did not, for\r\nBarker was three years older than he, and very powerful.  Such an attack\r\nwould have been most unfortunate for him in every way.  But at this\r\ninstant some boys hearing the quarrel ran up, and Russell among them.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, Barker," said one; "what\'s up?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'m teaching this new fry to be less bumptious, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Shame!" said Russell, as he saw the mark on Eric\'s cheek; "what a\r\nfellow you are, Barker.  Why couldn\'t you let him alone for the first\r\nday at any rate?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you?  I\'ll kick you too if you say much."\r\n\r\n"Cave! cave!" whispered half a dozen voices, and instantly the knot of\r\nboys dispersed in every direction, as Mr Gordon was seen approaching.\r\nHe had caught a glimpse of the scene without understanding it, and\r\nseeing the new boy\'s red and angry face, he only said, as he passed by,\r\n"What, Williams! fighting already?  Take care."\r\n\r\nThis was the cruellest cut of all.  "So," thought Eric, "a nice\r\nbeginning! it seems both boys and masters are against me," and very\r\ndisconsolately he walked to pick up his cap.\r\n\r\nThe boys were all dispersed on the playground at different games, and as\r\nhe went home he was stopped perpetually, and had to answer the usual\r\nquestions, "What\'s your name?  Are you a boarder or a day scholar?  What\r\nform are you in?"  Eric expected all this, and it therefore did not\r\nannoy him.  Under any other circumstances, he would have answered\r\ncheerfully and frankly enough; but now he felt miserable at his\r\nmorning\'s rencontre, and his answers were short and sheepish, his only\r\ndesire being to get away as soon as possible.  It was an additional\r\nvexation to feel sure that his manner did not make a favourable\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nBefore he had got out of the playground, Russell ran up to him.  "I\'m\r\nafraid you won\'t like this, or think much of us, Williams," he said.\r\n"But never mind.  It\'ll only last a day or two, and the fellows are not\r\nso bad as they seem; except that Barker.  I\'m sorry you\'ve come across\r\nhim, but it can\'t be helped."\r\n\r\nIt was the first kind word he had had since the morning, and after his\r\ntroubles kindness melted him.  He felt half inclined to cry, and for a\r\nfew moments could say nothing in reply to Russell\'s soothing words.  But\r\nthe boy\'s friendliness went far to comfort him, and at last, shaking\r\nhands with him, he said--\r\n\r\n"Do let me speak to you sometimes, while I am a new boy, Russell."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Russell, laughing, "as much as ever you like.  And as\r\nBarker hates me pretty much as he seems inclined to hate you, we are in\r\nthe same box.  Good-bye."\r\n\r\nSo Eric left the field, and wandered home, like Calchas in the Iliad,\r\n"sorrowful by the side of the sounding sea."  Already the purple mantle\r\nhad fallen from his ideal of schoolboy life.  He got home later than\r\nthey expected, and found his parents waiting for him.  It was rather\r\ndisappointing to them to see his face so melancholy, when they expected\r\nhim to be full of animation and pleasure.  Mrs Williams drew her own\r\nconclusions from the red mark on his cheek, as well as the traces of\r\ntears welling to his eyes; but, like a wise mother, she asked nothing,\r\nand left the boy to tell his own story,--which in time he did, omitting\r\nall the painful part, speaking enthusiastically of Russell, and only\r\nadmitting that he had been a little teased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nBULLYING.\r\n\r\n  Give to the morn of life its natural blessedness.\r\n  _Wordsworth_.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that new boys are almost invariably ill-treated?  I have often\r\nfancied that there must be in boyhood a pseudo-instinctive cruelty, a\r\nsort of "wild trick of the ancestral savage," which no amount of\r\ncivilisation can entirely repress.  Certain it is, that to most boys the\r\nfirst term is a trying ordeal.  They are being tested and weighed.\r\nTheir place in the general estimation is not yet fixed, and the\r\nslightest circumstances are seized upon to settle the category, under\r\nwhich the boy is to be classed.  A few apparently trivial accidents of\r\nhis first few weeks at school often decide his position in the general\r\nregard for the remainder of his boyhood.  And yet these are not\r\naccidents; they are the slight indications which give an unerring proof\r\nof the general tendencies of his character and training.  Hence much of\r\nthe apparent cruelty with which new boys are treated is not exactly\r\nintentional.  At first, of course, as they can have no friends worth\r\nspeaking of; there are always plenty of coarse and brutal minds that\r\ntake a pleasure in their torment, particularly if they at once recognise\r\nany innate superiority to themselves.  Of this class was Barker.  He\r\nhated Eric at first sight, simply because his feeble mind could only\r\nrealise one idea about him, and that was the new boy\'s striking contrast\r\nwith his own imperfections.  Hence he left no means untried to vent on\r\nEric his low and mean jealousy.  He showed undisguised pleasure when he\r\nfell in form, and signs of disgust when he rose; he fomented every\r\nlittle source of disapproval or quarrelling which happened to arise\r\nagainst him; he never looked at him without a frown or a sneer; he\r\nwaited for him to kick and annoy him as he came out of, or went in to,\r\nthe schoolroom.  In fact, he did his very best to make the boy\'s life\r\nmiserable, and the occupation of hating him seemed in some measure to\r\nfill up the vacuity of an ill-conditioned and degraded mind.\r\n\r\nHatred is a most mysterious and painful phenomenon to the unhappy person\r\nwho is the object of it, and more especially if he have incurred it by\r\nno one assignable reason.  Why it happens that no heart can be so\r\ngenerous, no life so self-denying, no intentions so honourable and pure,\r\nas to shield a man from the enmity of his fellows, must remain a dark\r\nquestion for ever.  But certain it is, that to bear the undeserved\r\nmalignity of the evil-minded, to hear unmoved the sneers of the proud\r\nand the calumnies of the base, is one of the hardest lessons in life.\r\nAnd to Eric this opposition was peculiarly painful; he was utterly\r\nunprepared for it.  In his bright joyous life at Fairholm, in the little\r\nhe saw of the boys at the Latin-school, he had met with nothing but\r\nkindness and caresses, and the generous nobleness of his character had\r\nseemed to claim them as a natural element.  "And now, why," he asked\r\nimpatiently, "should this bulldog sort of fellow have set his whole aim\r\nto annoy, vex, and hurt me?"  Incapable himself of so mean a spirit of\r\njealousy at superior excellence, he could not make it out; but such was\r\nthe fact, and the very mysteriousness of it made it more intolerable to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nBut it must be admitted that he made matters worse by his own bursts of\r\npassion.  His was not the temper to turn the other cheek; but, brave and\r\nspirited as he was, he felt how utterly hopeless would be any attempt on\r\nhis part to repel force by force.  He would have tried some slight\r\nconciliation, but it was really impossible with such a boy as his enemy.\r\nBarker never gave him even so much as an indifferent look, much less a\r\ncivil word.  Eric loathed him, and the only good and happy part of the\r\nmatter to his own mind was, that conscientiously his only desire was to\r\nget rid of him, and be left alone, while he never cherished a particle\r\nof revenge.\r\n\r\nWhile every day Eric was getting on better in form, and winning himself\r\na very good position with the other boys, who liked his frankness, his\r\nmirth, his spirit, and cleverness, he felt this feud with Barker like a\r\ndark background to all his enjoyment.  He even had to manoeuvre daily\r\nhow to escape him, and violent scenes were of constant occurrence\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nEric could not, and would not, brook his bullying with silence.  His\r\nresentment was loud and stinging, and, Ishmaelite as Barker was, even\r\n_his_ phlegmatic temperament took fire when Eric shouted his fierce and\r\nuncompromising retorts in the hearing of the others.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Eric was on the best of terms with the rest of the form, and\r\nsuch of the other boys as he knew, although, at first, his position as a\r\nhome-boarder prevented his knowing many.  Besides Russell, there were\r\nthree whom he liked best, and respected most--Duncan, Montagu, and Owen.\r\nThey were very different boys, but all of them had qualities which well\r\ndeserved his esteem.  Duncan was the most boyish of boys, intensely full\r\nof fun, good nature, and vigour; with fair abilities, he never got on\r\nwell, because he could not be still for two minutes; and even if, in\r\nsome fit of sudden ambition, he got up high in the form, he was sure to\r\nbe put to the bottom again before the day was over, for trifling or\r\ntalking.  But out of school he was the soul of every game; whatever _he_\r\ntook up was sure to be done pleasantly, and no party of amusement was\r\never planned without endeavouring to secure him as one of the number.\r\n\r\nMontagu\'s chief merit was, that he was such a thorough little gentleman;\r\n"such a jolly little fellow," every one said of him.  Without being\r\nclever or athletic, he managed to do very fairly both at work and at the\r\ngames, and while he was too exclusive to make many _intimate_ friends,\r\neverybody liked walking about or talking with him.  Even Barker,\r\nblackguard as he was, seemed to be a little uneasy when confronted with\r\nMontagu\'s naturally noble and chivalrous bearing.  In nearly all\r\nrespects his influence was thoroughly good, and few boys were more\r\ngenerally popular.\r\n\r\nOwen, again, was a very different boy.  His merit was a ceaseless\r\ndiligence, in which it was doubtful whether ambition or\r\nconscientiousness had the greatest share.  Reserved and thoughtful,\r\nunfitted for or indifferent to most games, he was anything but a\r\nfavourite with the rest, and Eric rather respected than liked him.  When\r\nhe first came he had been one of the most natural butts for Barker\'s\r\ncraving ill-nature, and for a time he had been tremendously bullied.\r\nBut gradually his mental superiority asserted itself.  He took\r\neverything without tears and without passion, and this diminished the\r\npleasure of annoying him.  One day when Barker had given him an\r\nunprovoked kick, he quietly said--\r\n\r\n"Barker, next time you do that I\'ll tell Mr Gordon."\r\n\r\n"Sneak! do it if you dare."  And he kicked him again; but the moment\r\nafter he was sorry for it, for there was a dark look in Owen\'s eyes, as\r\nhe turned instantly into the door of the master\'s room, and laid a\r\nformal complaint against Barker for bullying.\r\n\r\nMr Gordon didn\'t like "telling," and he said so to Owen, without\r\nreserve.  An ordinary boy would have broken into a flood of explanations\r\nand palliations, but Owen simply bowed, and said nothing.  "He stood\r\nthere for justice," and he had counted the cost.  Strong-minded and\r\nclear-headed, he calculated correctly that the momentary dislike of his\r\nschool-fellows, with whom he well knew that he never could be popular,\r\nwould be less unbearable than Barker\'s villainous insults.  The\r\nconsequence was, that Mr Gordon caned Barker soundly, although, with\r\nsome injustice, he made no attempt to conceal that he did it\r\nunwillingly.\r\n\r\nOf course the fellows were very indignant with Owen for sneaking, as\r\nthey called it, and for a week or two he had the keen mortification of\r\nseeing "Owen is a sneak" written up all about the walls.  But he was too\r\nproud or too cold to make any defence till called upon, and bore it in\r\nsilence.  Barker threatened eternal vengeance, and the very day after\r\nhad seized Owen with the avowed intention of "half murdering him."  But\r\nbefore he could once strike him, Owen said in the most chill tone,\r\n"Barker, if you touch me, I shall go straight to Dr Rowlands."  The\r\nbully well knew that Owen never broke his word, but he could not govern\r\nhis rage, and first giving Owen a violent shake, he proceeded to thrash\r\nhim without limit or remorse.\r\n\r\nPale but unmoved, Owen got away, and walked straight to Dr Rowlands\'s\r\ndoor.  The thing was unheard of, and the boys were amazed at his\r\ntemerity, for the Doctor was to all their imaginations a regular _Deus\r\nex machina_.  That afternoon, again, Barker was publicly caned, with the\r\nthreat that the next offence would be followed by instant and public\r\nexpulsion.  This punishment he particularly dreaded, because he was\r\nintended for the army, and he well knew that it might ruin his\r\nprospects.  The consequence was, that Owen never suffered from him\r\nagain, although he daily received a shower of oaths and curses, which he\r\npassed over with silent contempt.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not recommend any boy to imitate Owen in this matter.  It is a\r\nfar better and braver thing to bear bullying with such a mixture of\r\nspirit and good-humour, as in time to disarm it.  But Owen was a\r\npeculiar boy, and remember he had _no_ redress.  He bore for a time,\r\nuntil he felt that he _must_ have the justice and defence, without which\r\nit would have been impossible for him to continue at Roslyn School.\r\n\r\nBut why, you ask, didn\'t he tell the monitors?  Unfortunately at Roslyn\r\nthe monitorial system was not established.  Although it was a school of\r\n250 boys, the sixth-form, with all their privileges, had no prerogative\r\nof authority.  They hadn\'t the least right to interfere, because no such\r\npower had been delegated to them, and therefore they felt themselves\r\nmerely on a par with the rest, except for such eminence as their\r\nintellectual superiority gave them.  The consequence was, that any\r\ninterference from them would have been of a simply individual nature,\r\nand was exerted very rarely.  It would have done Owen no more good to\r\ntell a sixth-form boy than to tell any other boy; and as he was not a\r\nfavourite, he was not likely to find any champion to fight his battles\r\nor maintain his just rights.\r\n\r\nAll this had happened before Eric\'s time, and he heard it from his best\r\nfriend Russell.  His heart clave to that boy.  They became friends at\r\nonce by a kind of electric sympathy; the first glance of each at the\r\nother\'s face prepared the friendship, and every day of acquaintance more\r\nfirmly cemented it.  Eric could not have had a better friend; not so\r\nclever as himself not so diligent as Owen, not so athletic as Duncan, or\r\nso fascinating as Montagu, Russell combined the best qualities of them\r\nall.  And, above all, he acted invariably from the highest principle; he\r\npresented that noblest of all noble spectacles--one so rare that many\r\nthink it impossible--the spectacle of an honourable, pure-hearted, happy\r\nboy, who, as his early years speed by, is ever growing in wisdom and\r\nstature, and favour with God and man.\r\n\r\n"Did that brute Barker ever bully you as he bullies me?" said Eric one\r\nday, as he walked on the sea-shore with his friend.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Russell.  "I slept in his dormitory when I first came, and\r\nhe has often made me so wretched that I have flung myself on my knees at\r\nnight in pretence of prayer, but really to get a little quiet time to\r\ncry like a child."\r\n\r\n"And when was it he left off at last?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you know, Upton in the fifth is my cousin, and very fond of me; he\r\nheard of it, though I didn\'t say anything about it, and told Barker that\r\nif ever he caught him at it, he would thrash him within an inch of his\r\nlife; and that frightened him for one thing.  Besides, Duncan, Montagu,\r\nand other friends of mine, began to cut him in consequence, so he\r\nthought it best to leave off."\r\n\r\n"How is it, Russell, that fellows stand by and let him do it?"\r\n\r\n"You see," said Russell, "Barker is an enormously strong fellow, and\r\nthat makes the younger chaps, whom he fags, look up to him as a great\r\nhero.  And there isn\'t one in our part of the school who can thrash him.\r\nBesides, people never do interfere, you know--at least not often.  I\r\nremember once seeing a street-row in London, at which twenty people\r\nstood by, and let a drunken beast of a husband strike his wife without\r\never stirring to defend her."\r\n\r\n"Well," sighed Eric, "I hope my day of deliverance will come soon, for I\r\ncan\'t stand it much longer, and `tell\' I won\'t, whatever Owen may do."\r\n\r\nEric\'s deliverance came very soon.  It was afternoon; the boys were\r\nplaying at different games in the green playground, and he was waiting\r\nfor his turn at rounders.  At this moment Barker lounged up, and calmly\r\nsnatching off Eric\'s cap, shied it over Dr Rowlands\'s garden-wall.\r\n"There, go and fetch that."\r\n\r\n"You blackguard," said Eric, standing irresolutely for a few minutes;\r\nand then with tears in his eyes began to climb the wall.  It was not\r\nvery high, but boys were peremptorily forbidden to get over it under any\r\ncircumstances, and Eric broke the rule not without trepidation.\r\nHowever, he dropped down on one of Mrs Rowlands\'s flower-beds, got his\r\ncap in a hurry, and clambered back undiscovered.\r\n\r\nHe thought this would have satisfied his tormentor for one day; but\r\nBarker was in a mischievous mood, so he again came up to Eric, and\r\ncalling out, "Who\'ll have a game at football?" again snatched the cap,\r\nand gave it a kick; Eric tried to recover it, but every time he came up\r\nBarker gave it a fresh kick, and finally kicked it into a puddle.\r\n\r\nEric stood still, trembling with rage, while his eyes lightened scorn\r\nand indignation.  "You hulking, stupid, cowardly bully,"--here Barker\r\nseized him, and every word brought a tremendous blow on the head; but\r\nblind with passion Eric went on--"you despicable bully, I won\'t touch\r\nthat cap again; you shall pick it up yourself.  Duncan, Russell, here!\r\ndo help me against this intolerable brute."\r\n\r\nSeveral boys ran up, but they were all weaker than Barker, who besides\r\nwas now in a towering fury, and kicked Eric unmercifully.\r\n\r\n"Leave him alone," shouted Duncan, seizing Barker\'s arm; "what a\r\nconfounded bully you are--always plaguing some one."\r\n\r\n"I shall do as I like; mind your own business," growled Barker, roughly\r\nshaking himself free from Duncan\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Barker, I\'ll never speak to you again from this day," said Montagu,\r\nturning on his heel, with a look of withering contempt.\r\n\r\n"What do I care? puppy, you want taking down too," was the reply, and\r\nsome more kicks at Eric followed.\r\n\r\n"Barker, I won\'t stand this any longer," said Russell, "so look out,"\r\nand grasping Barker by the collar, he dealt him a swinging blow on the\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe bully stood in amazement, and dropped Eric, who fell on the turf\r\nnearly fainting, and bleeding at the nose.  But now Russell\'s turn came,\r\nand in a moment Barker, who was twice his weight, had tripped him up,--\r\nwhen he found himself collared in an iron grasp.\r\n\r\nThere had been an unobserved spectator of the whole scene, in the person\r\nof Mr Williams himself, and it was his strong hand that now gripped\r\nBarker\'s shoulder.  He was greatly respected by the boys, who all knew\r\nhis tall handsome figure by sight, and he frequently stood a quiet and\r\npleased observer of their games.  The boys in the playground came\r\ncrowding round, and Barker in vain struggled to escape.  Mr Williams\r\nheld him firmly, and said in a calm voice, "I have just seen you treat\r\none of your school-fellows with the grossest violence.  It makes me\r\nblush for you, Roslyn boys," he continued, turning to the group that\r\nsurrounded him, "that you can even for a moment stand by unmoved, and\r\nsee such things done.  You know that you despise any one who tells a\r\nmaster, yet you allow this bullying to go on, and that, too, without any\r\nprovocation.  Now, mark; it makes no difference that the boy who has\r\nbeen hurt is my own son; I would have punished this scoundrel whoever it\r\nhad been, and I shall punish him now."  With these words, he lifted the\r\nriding-whip which he happened to be carrying, and gave Barker by far the\r\nseverest castigation he had ever undergone; the boys declared that Mr\r\nRowlands\'s "swishings" were nothing to it.  Mr Williams saw that the\r\noffender was a tough subject, and determined that he should not soon\r\nforget the punishment he then received.  He had never heard from Eric\r\nhow this boy had been treating him, but he had heard it from Russell,\r\nand now he had seen one of the worst specimens of it with his own eyes.\r\n\r\nHe therefore belaboured him till his sullen obstinacy gave way to a roar\r\nfor mercy, and promises never so to offend again.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis he flung the boy from him with a "phew" of disgust, and\r\nsaid, "I give nothing for your word; but if ever you do bully in this\r\nway again, and I see or hear of it, your present punishment shall be a\r\ntrifle to what I shall then administer.  At present, thank me for not\r\ninforming your master."  So saying, he made Barker pick up the cap, and,\r\nturning away, walked home with Eric leaning on his arm.\r\n\r\nBarker, too, carried himself off with the best grace he could; but it\r\ncertainly didn\'t mend matters when he heard numbers of fellows, even\r\nlittle boys, say openly, "I\'m so glad; serves you right."\r\n\r\nFrom that day Eric was never troubled with personal violence from Barker\r\nor any other boy.  But rancour smouldered deep in the mind of the\r\nbaffled tyrant, and, as we shall see hereafter, there are subtler means\r\nof making an enemy wretched than striking or kicking him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nCRIBBING.\r\n\r\n  Et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus.--Juvenal i. 15.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that Eric\'s year as a home-boarder was made up of\r\ndark experiences.  Roslyn had a very bright as well as a dark side and\r\nEric enjoyed it "to the finger-tips."  School-life, like all other life,\r\nis an April day of shower and sunshine.  Its joys may be more childish,\r\nits sorrows more trifling, than those of after years;--but they are more\r\nkeenly felt.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, although we know it to be a mere delusion, we all idealise and\r\nidolise our childhood.  The memory of it makes pleasant purple in the\r\ndistance, and as we look back on the sunlight of its blue far-off hills,\r\nwe forget how steep we sometimes found them.\r\n\r\nUpon Barker\'s discomfiture, which took place some three weeks after his\r\narrival, Eric liked the school more and more, and got liked by it more\r\nand more.  This might have been easily foreseen, for he was the type of\r\na thoroughly boyish nature in its more genial and honourable\r\ncharacteristics, and his round of acquaintances daily increased.  Among\r\nothers, a few of the sixth, who were also day-scholars, began to notice\r\nand walk home with him.  He looked on them as great heroes, and their\r\ncondescension much increased his dignity both in his own estimation and\r\nthat of his equals.\r\n\r\nNow, too, he began to ask some of his most intimate acquaintances to\r\nspend an evening with him sometimes at home.  This was a pleasure much\r\ncoveted, for no boy ever saw Mrs Williams without loving her, and they\r\nfelt themselves humanised by the friendly interest of a lady who\r\nreminded every boy of his own mother.  Vernon, too, now a lively and\r\nactive child of nine, was a great pet among them, so that every one\r\nliked Eric who "knew him at home."  A boy generally shows his best side\r\nat home; the softening shadows of a mother\'s tender influence play over\r\nhim, and tone down the roughnesses of boyish character.  Duncan, Montagu\r\nand Owen were special favourites in the home circle, and Mrs Williams\r\nfelt truly glad that her son had singled out friends who seemed, on the\r\nwhole, so desirable.  But Montagu and Russell were the most frequent\r\nvisitors, and the latter became almost like one of the family; he won so\r\nmuch on all their hearts that Mrs Williams was not surprised when Eric\r\nconfided to her one day that he loved Russell almost as well as he loved\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\nAs Christmas approached, the boys began to take a lively interest in the\r\nhalf-year\'s prizes, and Eric was particularly eager about them.  He had\r\nimproved wonderfully, and as both his father and mother prevented him\r\nfrom being idle, even had he been so inclined, he had soon shown that he\r\nwas one of the best in the form.  Two prizes were given half-yearly to\r\neach remove; one for "marks," indicating the boy who had generally been\r\nhighest throughout the half-year, and the other for the best proofs of\r\nproficiency in a special examination.  It was commonly thought in the\r\nform that Owen would get the first of these prizes, and Eric the other;\r\nand towards the approach of the examination, he threw his whole energy\r\ninto the desire to win.  The desire was not selfish.  Some ambition was\r\nof course natural; but he longed for the prize chiefly for the delight\r\nwhich he knew his success would cause at Fairholm, and still more to his\r\nown family.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week an untoward circumstance happened, which, while it\r\nincreased his popularity, diminished a good deal (as he thought) his\r\nchance of success.  The fourth-form were learning a Homer lesson, and\r\nBarker, totally unable to do it by his own resources, was trying to\r\nborrow a crib.  Eric, much to their mutual disgust, still sat next to\r\nhim in school, and would have helped him if he had chosen to ask; but he\r\nnever did choose, nor did Eric care to volunteer.  The consequence was,\r\nthat unless he could borrow a crib, he was invariably turned, and he was\r\nnow particularly anxious to get one, because the time was nearly up.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain idle, good-natured boy, named Llewellyn, who had\r\n"cribs" to every book they did, and who, with a pernicious _bonhommie_,\r\nlent them promiscuously to the rest, all of whom were only too glad to\r\navail themselves of the help, except the few at the top of the form, who\r\nfound it a slovenly way of learning the lesson, which was sure to get\r\nthem into worse difficulties than an honest attempt to master the\r\nmeaning for themselves.  Llewellyn sat at the farther end of the form in\r\nfront, so Barker scribbled in the fly-leaf of his book, "Please send us\r\nyour Homer crib," and got the book passed on to Llewellyn, who\r\nimmediately shoved his crib in Barker\'s direction.  The only danger of\r\nthe transaction being noticed was when the book was being handed from\r\none bench to another, and as Eric unluckily had an end seat, he had got\r\ninto trouble more than once.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, just as Graham, the last boy on the form in front,\r\nhanded Eric the crib, Mr Gordon happened to look up, and Eric, very\r\nnaturally anxious to screen another from trouble, popped the book under\r\nhis own Homer.\r\n\r\n"Williams, what are you doing?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir," said Eric, looking up innocently.\r\n\r\n"Bring me that book under your Homer."\r\n\r\nEric blushed, hesitated--but at last, amid a dead silence, took up the\r\nbook.  Mr Gordon looked at it for a minute, let it fall on the ground,\r\nand then, with an unnecessary affectation of disgust, took it up with\r\nthe tongs, and dropped it into the grate.  There was a titter round the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n"Silence!" thundered the master; "this is no matter for laughing.  So,\r\nsir, _this_ is the way you get up to the top of the form?"\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t using it, sir," said Eric.\r\n\r\n"Not using it.  Why, I saw you put it, open, under your Homer."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t mine, sir."\r\n\r\n"Then whose is it?"  Mr Gordon, motioning to Eric to pick up the book,\r\nlooked at the fly-leaf, but of course no name was there; in those days\r\nit was dangerous to write one\'s name in a translation.\r\n\r\nEric was silent.\r\n\r\n"Under the circumstances, Williams, I must punish you," said Mr Gordon.\r\n"Of course I am _bound_ to believe you, but the circumstances are very\r\nsuspicious.  You had no business with such a book at all.  Hold out your\r\nhand."\r\n\r\nAs yet Eric had never been caned.  It would have been easy for him in\r\nthis case to clear himself without mentioning names, but (very rightly)\r\nhe thought it unmanly to clamour about being punished, and he felt\r\nnettled at Mr Gordon\'s merely official belief of his word.  He knew\r\nthat he had his faults, but certainly want of honour was not among them.\r\nIndeed, there were only three boys out of the twenty in the form who\r\ndid not resort to modes of unfairness far worse than the use of cribs,\r\nand those three were--Russell, Owen, and himself; even Duncan, even\r\nMontagu, inured to it by custom, were not ashamed to read their lesson\r\noff a concealed book, or copy a date from a furtive piece of paper.\r\nThey would have been ashamed of it before they came to Roslyn School,\r\nbut the commonness of the habit had now made them blind or indifferent\r\nto its meanness.  It was peculiarly bad in the fourth-form, because the\r\nmaster treated them with implicit confidence, and being scrupulously\r\nhonourable himself, was unsuspicious of others.  He was therefore\r\nextremely indignant at this apparent discovery of an attempt to\r\noverreach him in a boy so promising and so much of a favourite as Eric\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\n"Hold out your hand," he repeated.\r\n\r\nEric did so, and the cane tingled sharply across his palm.  He could\r\nbear the pain well enough, but he was keenly alive to the disgrace; he,\r\na boy at the head of his form, to be caned in this way by a man who\r\ndidn\'t understand him, and unjustly too!  He mustered up an indifferent\r\nair, closed his lips tight, and determined to give no further signs.\r\nThe defiance of his look made Mr Gordon angry, and he inflicted in\r\nsuccession five hard cuts on either hand, each one of which was more\r\nexcruciating than the last.\r\n\r\n"Now, go to your seat."\r\n\r\nEric did go to his seat, with all his bad passions roused, and he walked\r\nin a jaunty and defiant kind of way, that made the master really grieve\r\nat the disgrace into which he had fallen.  But he instantly became a\r\nhero with the form, who unanimously called him a great brick for not\r\ntelling, and admired him immensely for bearing up without crying under\r\nso severe a punishment.  The punishment _was_ most severe, and for some\r\nweeks after there were dark weals visible across Eric\'s palm, which\r\nrendered the use of his hands painful.\r\n\r\n"Poor Williams," said Duncan, as they went out of school, "how very\r\nplucky of you not to cry."\r\n\r\n  "Vengeance deep brooding o\'er the _cane_\r\n  Had locked the source of softer woe\r\n  And burning pride and high disdain\r\n  Forbade the gentler tear to flow," said Eric, with a smile.\r\n\r\nBut he only bore up till he got home, and there, while he was telling\r\nhis father the occurrence, he burst into a storm of passionate tears,\r\nmingled with the fiercest invectives against Mr Gordon for his\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\n"Never mind, Eric," said his father; "only take care that you never get\r\na punishment _justly_, and I shall always be as proud of you as I am\r\nnow.  And don\'t cherish this resentment, my boy; it will only do you\r\nharm.  Try to forgive and forget."\r\n\r\n"But, father, Mr Gordon is so hasty.  I have indeed been rather a\r\nfavourite of his, yet now he shows that he has no confidence in me.  It\r\nis a great shame that he shouldn\'t believe my word.  I don\'t mind the\r\npain; but I shan\'t like him any more, and I\'m sure now I shan\'t get the\r\nexamination prize."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean, Eric, that he will be influenced by partiality in the\r\nmatter?"\r\n\r\n"No, father, not exactly; at least I dare say he won\'t _intend_ to be.\r\nBut it is unlucky to be on bad terms with a master, and I know I shan\'t\r\nwork so well."\r\n\r\nOn the whole the boy was right in thinking this incident a misfortune.\r\nAlthough he had nothing particular for which to blame himself, yet the\r\naffair had increased his pride, while it lowered his self-respect; and\r\nhe had an indistinct consciousness that the popularity in his form would\r\ndo him as much harm as the change of feeling in his master.  He grew\r\ncareless and dispirited, nor was it till in the very heat of the final\r\ncompetition that he felt his energies fully revived.\r\n\r\nHalf the form were as eager about the examination as the other half were\r\nindifferent; but none were more eager than Eric.  He was much hindered\r\nby Barker\'s unceasing attempt to copy his papers surreptitiously; and\r\nvery much disgusted at the shameless way in which many of the boys\r\n"cribbed" from books, and from each other, or used torn leaves concealed\r\nin their sleeves, or dates written on their wristbands and on their\r\nnails.  He saw how easily much of this might have been prevented; but\r\nMr Gordon was fresh at his work, and had not yet learned the practical\r\nlesson (which cost him many a qualm of sorrow and disgust), that to\r\ntrust young boys to any great extent is really to increase their\r\ntemptations.  He _did_ learn the lesson afterwards, and then almost\r\nentirely suppressed the practice, partly by increased vigilance, and\r\npartly by forbidding _any_ book to be brought into the room during the\r\ntime of examination.  But meanwhile much evil had been done by the\r\nhabitual abuse of his former confidence.\r\n\r\nI shall not linger over the examination.  At its close, the day before\r\nthe breaking up, the list was posted on the door of the great\r\nschoolroom, and most boys made an impetuous rush to see the result.  But\r\nEric was too nervous to be present at the hour when this was usually\r\ndone, and he had asked Russell to bring him the news.\r\n\r\nHe was walking up and down the garden, counting the number of steps he\r\ntook, counting the number of shrubs along each path, and devising every\r\nsort of means to beguile the time, when he heard hasty steps, and\r\nRussell burst in at the back gate, breathless with haste and bright with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah! old fellow!" he cried, seizing both Eric\'s hands; "I never felt\r\nso glad in my life," and he shook his friend\'s arms up and down,\r\nlaughing joyously.\r\n\r\n"Well! tell me," said Eric.\r\n\r\n"First, Owen and Williams aequales," said he; "you\'ve got head-remove,\r\nyou see, in spite of your forebodings, as I always said you would; and I\r\ncongratulate you with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"No?" said Eric, "have I really?--you\'re not joking?  Oh! hurrah!--I\r\nmust rush in and tell them," and he bounded off.\r\n\r\nIn a second he was back at Russell\'s side.  "What a selfish animal I am!\r\nWhere are you placed, Russell?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! magnificent; I\'m third--far higher than I expected."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad," said Eric.  "Come in with me and tell them.  I\'m\r\nhead-remove, mother," he shouted, springing into the parlour where his\r\nfather and mother sat.\r\n\r\nIn the lively joy that this announcement excited, Russell stood by for\r\nthe moment unheeded; and when Eric took him by the hand to tell them\r\nthat he was third, he hung his head, and a tear was in his eye.\r\n\r\n"Poor boy!  I\'m afraid you\'re disappointed," said Mrs Williams kindly,\r\ndrawing him to her side.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no! it\'s not _that_," said Russell hastily, as he lifted his\r\nswimming eyes to her face.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, Russell?" asked Eric, surprised.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing; don\'t ask me; I\'m only foolish to-day," and with a burst\r\nof sorrow he bent down, and hid his face.  Mrs Williams guessed the\r\nsource of his anguish, and soothed him tenderly; nor was she surprised\r\nwhen, as soon as his sobs would let him speak, he kissed her hand, and\r\nwhispered in a low tone, "It is but a year since I became an orphan."\r\n\r\n"Dearest child," she said, "I know how to sympathise with you.  But I am\r\nsure, my boy, that you have learnt to feel Who is the Father of the\r\nfatherless."\r\n\r\nRussell\'s eye brightened, but his only answer was a look of intelligence\r\nand gratitude, as he hastily dried his tears.\r\n\r\nGradually he grew calmer.  They made him stay to dinner and spend the\r\nrest of the day there, and by the evening he had recovered all his usual\r\nsprightliness.  Towards sunset he and Eric went for a stroll down the\r\nbay, and talked over the term and the examination.\r\n\r\nThey sat down on a green bank just beyond the beach, and watched the\r\ntide come in, while the sea-distance was crimson with the glory of\r\nevening.  The beauty and the murmur filled them with a quiet happiness,\r\nnot untinged with the melancholy thought of parting the next day.\r\n\r\nAt last Eric broke the silence.  "Russell, let me always call you Edwin,\r\nand call me Eric."\r\n\r\n"Very gladly, Eric.  Your coming here has made me so happy."  And the\r\ntwo boys squeezed each other\'s hands, and looked into each other\'s\r\nfaces, and silently promised that they would be loving friends for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND TERM.\r\n\r\n  Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil our vines; for our\r\n  vines have tender grapes.--Cant. ii. 15.\r\n\r\nThe second term at school is generally the great test of the strength of\r\na boy\'s principles and resolutions.  During the first term the novelty,\r\nthe loneliness, the dread of unknown punishments, the respect for\r\nauthorities, the desire to measure himself with his companions--all tend\r\nto keep him right and diligent.  But many of these incentives are\r\nremoved after the first brush of novelty, and many a lad who has given\r\ngood promise at first, turns out, after a short probation, idle or\r\nvicious, or indifferent.\r\n\r\nBut there was little comparative danger for Eric, so long as he\r\ncontinued to be a home-boarder, which was for another half-year.  On the\r\ncontrary, he was anxious to support in his new remove the prestige of\r\nhaving been head-boy; and as he still continued under Mr Gordon, he\r\nreally wished to turn over a new leaf in his conduct towards him, and\r\nrecover, if possible, his lost esteem.\r\n\r\nHis popularity was a fatal snare.  He enjoyed and was very proud of it,\r\nand was half inclined to be angry with Russell for not fully sharing his\r\nfeelings; but Russell had a far larger experience of school-life than\r\nhis new friend, and dreaded with all his heart lest "he should follow a\r\nmultitude to do evil."\r\n\r\nThe "cribbing," which had astonished and pained Eric at first, was more\r\nflagrant than even in the Upper-Fourth, and assumed a chronic form.  In\r\nall the Repetition lessons one of the boys used to write out in a large\r\nhand the passage to be learnt by heart, and dexterously pin it to the\r\nfront of Mr Gordon\'s desk.  There any boy who chose could read it off\r\nwith little danger of detection, and, as before, the only boys who\r\nrefused to avail themselves of this trickery were Eric, Russell, and\r\nOwen.\r\n\r\nEric did _not_ yield to it; never once did he suffer his eyes to glance\r\nat the paper when his turn to repeat came round.  But although this was\r\nthe case, he never spoke against the practice to the other boys, even\r\nwhen he lost places by it.  Nay more, he would laugh when any one told\r\nhim how he had escaped "skewing" (i.e. being turned) by reading it off;\r\nand he even went so far as to allow them to suppose that he wouldn\'t\r\nhimself object to take advantage of the master\'s unsuspicious\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n"I say, Williams," said Duncan, one morning as they strolled into the\r\nschool-yard, "do you know your Repetition?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Eric, "not very well; I haven\'t given more than ten minutes\r\nto it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, never mind it now; come and have a game at racquets.  Russell\r\nand Montagu have taken the court."\r\n\r\n"But I shall skew."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, you needn\'t, you know.  I\'ll take care to pin it upon the desk\r\nnear you."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t much care.  At any rate I\'ll chance it."  And off the\r\nboys ran to the racquet-court, Eric intending to occupy the last quarter\r\nof an hour before school-time in learning his lesson.  Russell and he\r\nstood the other two, and they were very well matched.  They had finished\r\ntwo splendid games, and each side had been victorious in turn, when\r\nDuncan, in the highest spirits, shouted, "Now, Russell, for the\r\nconqueror."\r\n\r\n"Get some one else in my place," said Russell; "I don\'t know my\r\nRepetition, and must cut and learn it."\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother the Repetition," said Montagu, "somebody\'s sure to write it\r\nout in school, and old Gordon\'ll never see."\r\n\r\n"You forget, Montagu, I don\'t deign to crib.  It isn\'t fair."\r\n\r\n"Oh ay, I forgot.  Well, after all, you\'re quite right; I only wish I\r\nwas as good."\r\n\r\n"What a capital fellow he is," continued Montagu, leaning on his racquet\r\nand looking after him, as Russell left the court.  "But I say, Williams,\r\nyou\'re not going too, are you?"\r\n\r\n"I think I must, I don\'t know half my lesson."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, I don\'t go; there\'s Llewellyn; he\'ll take Russell\'s place, and\r\nwe _must_ have the conquering game."\r\n\r\nAgain Eric yielded; and when the clock struck, he ran into school, hot,\r\nvexed with himself and certain to break down, just as Russell strolled\r\nin, whispering, "I\'ve had lots of time to get up the Horace, and know it\r\npat."\r\n\r\nStill he clung to the little thistledown of hope that he should have\r\nplenty of time to cram it before the form were called up.  But another\r\ntemptation waited him.  No sooner was he seated than Graham whispered,\r\n"Williams, it\'s your turn to write out the Horace; I did last time, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\nPoor Eric!  He was reaping the fruits of his desire to keep up\r\npopularity, which had prevented him from expressing a manly disapproval\r\nof the general cheating.  Everybody seemed to assume now that _he_ at\r\nany rate didn\'t think much of it, and he had never claimed his real\r\nright up to that time of asserting his innocence.  But this was a step\r\nfarther than he had ever gone before.  He drew back--\r\n\r\n"My _turn_, what do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you know as well as I do that we all write it out by turns."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say Owen or Russell ever wrote it out?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not; you wouldn\'t expect the saints to be guilty of such a\r\nthing, would you?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather not, Graham," he said, getting very red.\r\n\r\n"Well, that _is_ cowardly," answered Graham angrily; "then I suppose I\r\nmust do it myself."\r\n\r\n"Here, I\'ll do it," said Eric suddenly; "shy us the paper."\r\n\r\nHis conscience smote him bitterly.  In his silly dread of giving\r\noffence, he was doing what he heartily despised, and he felt most\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n"There," he said, pushing the paper from him in a pet; "I\'ve written it,\r\nand I\'ll have nothing more to do with it."\r\n\r\nJust as he finished, they were called up, and Barker, taking the paper,\r\nsucceeded in pinning it as usual on the front of the desk.  Eric had\r\nnever seen it done so carelessly and clumsily before, and firmly\r\nbelieved, what was indeed a fact, that Barker had done it badly on\r\npurpose, in the hope that it might be discovered, and so Eric be got\r\nonce more into a scrape.  He was in an agony of apprehension, and when\r\nput on, was totally unable to say a word of his Repetition.  But far as\r\nhe had yielded, he would not cheat like the rest; in this respect, at\r\nany rate, he would not give up his claim to chivalrous and stainless\r\nhonour; he kept his eyes resolutely turned away from the guilty paper,\r\nand even refused to repeat the words which were prompted in his ear by\r\nthe boys on each side.  Mr Gordon, after waiting a moment, said--\r\n\r\n"Why, sir, you know nothing about it; you can\'t have looked at it.  Go\r\nto the bottom, and write it out five times."\r\n\r\n"_Write it out_," thought Eric; "this is retribution, I suppose," and,\r\ncovered with shame and vexation, he took his place below the malicious\r\nBarker at the bottom of the form.\r\n\r\nIt happened that during the lesson the fire began to smoke, and Mr\r\nGordon told Owen to open the window for a moment.  No sooner was this\r\ndone than the mischievous whiff of sea-air which entered the room began\r\nto trifle and coquet with the pendulous half-sheet pinned in front of\r\nthe desk, causing thereby an unwonted little pattering crepitation.  In\r\nalarm, Duncan thoughtlessly pulled out the pin, and immediately the\r\npaper floated gracefully over Russell\'s head, as he sat at the top of\r\nthe form, and, after one or two gyrations, fluttered down in the centre\r\nof the room.\r\n\r\n"Bring me that piece of paper," said Mr Gordon, full of vague\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nSeveral boys moved uneasily, and Eric looked nervously round.\r\n\r\n"Did you hear? fetch me that half-sheet of paper."\r\n\r\nA boy picked it up, and handed it to him.  Mr Gordon held it for a full\r\nminute in his hands without a word, while vexation, deep disgust, and\r\nrising anger, struggled in his countenance.  At last, he suddenly turned\r\nfull on Eric, whose writing he recognised, and broke out--\r\n\r\n"So, sir! a second time caught in gross deceit.  I should not have\r\nthought it possible.  Your face and manners belie you.  You have lost my\r\nconfidence for ever.  I _despise_ you."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir," said the penitent Eric, "I never meant--"\r\n\r\n"Silence--you are detected, as cheats always will be.  I shall report\r\nyou to Dr Rowlands."\r\n\r\nThe next boy was put on, and broke down.  The same with the next, and\r\nthe next, and the next; Montagu, Graham, Llewellyn, Duncan, Barker, all\r\nhopeless failures; only two boys had said it right--Russell and Owen.\r\n\r\nMr Gordon\'s face grew blacker and blacker.  The deep undisguised pain\r\nwhich the discovery caused him was swallowed up in unbounded\r\nindignation.  "Deceitful, dishonourable boys," he exclaimed, "henceforth\r\nmy treatment of you shall be very different.  The whole form, except\r\nRussell and Owen, shall have an extra lesson every half-holiday; not one\r\nof the rest of you will I trust again.  I took you for gentlemen.  I was\r\nmistaken.  Go."  And so saying, he motioned them to their seats with\r\nimperious disdain.\r\n\r\nThey went, looking sheepish and ashamed.  Eric, deeply vexed, kept\r\ntwisting and untwisting a bit of paper, without raising his eyes, and\r\neven Barker thoroughly repented his short-sighted treachery; the rest\r\nwere silent and miserable.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock two boys lingered in the room to speak to Mr Gordon;\r\nthey were Eric Williams and Edwin Russell, but they were full of very\r\ndifferent feelings.\r\n\r\nEric stepped to the desk first.  Mr Gordon looked up.\r\n\r\n"You!  Williams, I wonder that you have the audacity to speak to me.\r\nGo--I have nothing to say to you."\r\n\r\n"But, sir, I want to tell you that--"\r\n\r\n"Your guilt is only too clear, Williams.  You will hear more of this.\r\nGo, I tell you."\r\n\r\nEric\'s passion overcame him; he stamped furiously on the ground, and\r\nburst out, "I _will_ speak, sir; you have been unjust to me for a long\r\ntime, but I will _not_ be--"\r\n\r\nMr Gordon\'s cane fell sharply across the boy\'s back; he stopped, glared\r\nfor a moment, and then saying, "Very well, sir!  I shall tell Dr\r\nRowlands that you strike before you hear me," he angrily left the room,\r\nand slammed the door violently behind him.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr Gordon had time to recover from his astonishment, Russell\r\nstood by him.\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy," said the master, softening in a moment, and laying his\r\nhand gently on Russell\'s head, "what have you to say?  You cannot tell\r\nhow I rejoice, amid the vexation and disgust that this has caused me, to\r\nfind that _you_ at least are honourable.  But I _knew_, Edwin, that I\r\ncould trust you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, I come to speak for Eric--for Williams."\r\n\r\nMr Gordon\'s brow darkened again and the storm gathered, as he\r\ninterrupted vehemently, "Not a word, Russell; not a word.  This is the\r\n_second_ time that he has wilfully deceived me; and this time he has\r\ninvolved others too in his base deceit."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir, you wrong him.  I can\'t think how he came to write the\r\npaper, but I _know_ that he did not and would not use it.  Didn\'t you\r\nsee yourself, sir, how he turned his head quite another way when he\r\nbroke down?"\r\n\r\n"It is very kind of you, Edwin, to defend him," said Mr Gordon coldly,\r\n"but at present, at any rate, I must not hear you.  Leave me; I feel\r\ndeeply vexed, and must have time to think over this disgraceful affair."\r\n\r\nRussell went away disconsolate, and met his friend striding up and down\r\nthe passage, waiting for Dr Rowlands to come out of the library.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Eric," he said, "how came you to write that paper?"\r\n\r\n"Why, Russell, I did feel very much ashamed, and I would have explained\r\nit, and said so; but that Gordon spites me so.  It is such a shame; I\r\ndon\'t feel now as if I cared one bit."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry you don\'t get on with him; but remember you have given him\r\nin this case good cause to suspect.  You never crib, Eric, I know, so I\r\ncan\'t help being sorry that you wrote the paper."\r\n\r\n"But then Graham asked me to do it, and called me cowardly because I\r\nrefused at first."\r\n\r\n"Ah, Eric," said Russell, "they will ask you to do worse things if you\r\nyield so easily.  I wouldn\'t say anything to Dr Rowlands about it, if I\r\nwere you."\r\n\r\nEric took the advice, and, full of mortification, went home.  He gave\r\nhis father a true and manly account of the whole occurrence, and that\r\nafternoon Mr Williams wrote a note of apology and explanation to Mr\r\nGordon.  Next time the form went up, Mr Gordon said, in his most\r\nfreezing tone, "Williams, at present I shall take no further notice of\r\nyour offence beyond including you in the extra lesson every\r\nhalf-holiday."\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Eric felt that he was marked and suspected, and\r\nthe feeling worked on him with the worst effects.  He grew more careless\r\nin work, and more trifling and indifferent in manner.  Several boys now\r\ngot above him in form whom he had easily surpassed before, and his\r\nenergies were for a time entirely directed to keeping that supremacy in\r\nthe games which he had won by his activity and strength.\r\n\r\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, toward the end of the summer term, and the\r\nboys were sauntering about in the green playground, or lying on the\r\nbanks reading and chatting.  Eric was with a little knot of his chief\r\nfriends, enjoying the sea-breeze as they sat on the grass.  At last the\r\nbell of the school chapel began to ring, and they went in to the\r\nafternoon service.  Eric usually sat with Duncan and Llewellyn,\r\nimmediately behind the benches allotted to chance visitors.  The bench\r\nin front of them happened on this afternoon to be occupied by some\r\nrather odd people, viz, an old man with long white hair,--and two ladies\r\nremarkably stout, who were dressed with much juvenility, although past\r\nmiddle age.  Their appearance immediately attracted notice, and no\r\nsooner had they taken their seats than Duncan and Llewellyn began to\r\ntitter.  The ladies\' bonnets, which were of white, trimmed with long\r\ngreen leaves and flowers, just peered over the top of the boys\' pew, and\r\nexcited much amusement; particularly when Duncan, in his irresistible\r\nsense of the ludicrous, began to adorn them with little bits of paper.\r\nBut Eric had not yet learnt to disregard the solemnity of the place, and\r\nthe sacred act in which they were engaged.  He tried to look away and\r\nattend to the service, and for a time he partially succeeded, although,\r\nseated as he was between the two triflers, who were perpetually\r\ntelegraphing to each other their jokes, he found it a difficult task,\r\nand secretly he began to be much tickled.\r\n\r\nAt last the sermon commenced, and Llewellyn, who had imprisoned a\r\ngrasshopper in a paper cage, suddenly let it hop out.  The first hop\r\ntook it to the top of the pew; the second perched it on the shoulder of\r\nthe stoutest lady.  Duncan and Llewellyn tittered louder, and even Eric\r\ncould not resist a smile.  But when the lady, feeling some irritation on\r\nher shoulder, raised her hand, and the grasshopper took a frightened\r\nleap into the centre of the green foliage which enwreathed her bonnet,\r\nnone of the three could stand it, and they burst into fits of laughter,\r\nwhich they tried in vain to conceal by bending down their heads and\r\ncramming their fists into their mouths.  Eric, having once given way,\r\nenjoyed the joke uncontrollably, and the lady made matters worse by her\r\nuneasy attempts to dislodge the unknown intruder, and discover the cause\r\nof the tittering, which she could not help hearing.  At last all three\r\nbegan to laugh so violently that several heads were turned in their\r\ndirection, and Dr Rowlands\'s stern eye caught sight of their levity.\r\nHe stopped short in his sermon, and for one instant transfixed them with\r\nhis indignant glance.  Quiet was instantly restored, and alarm reduced\r\nthem to the most perfect order, although the grasshopper still sat\r\nimperturbable among the artificial flowers.  Meanwhile the stout lady\r\nhad discovered that for some unknown reason she had been causing\r\nconsiderable amusement, and attributing it to intentional ridicule,\r\nlooked round, justly hurt.  Eric, with real shame, observed the pained\r\nuneasiness of her manner, and bitterly repented his share in the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nNext morning Dr Rowlands, in full academicals, sailed into the\r\nfourth-form room.  His entrance was the signal for every boy to rise,\r\nand after a word or two to Mr Gordon, he motioned them to be seated.\r\nEric\'s heart sank within him.\r\n\r\n"Williams, Duncan, and LLewellyn, stand out!" said the Doctor.  The\r\nboys, with downcast eyes and burning cheeks, stood before him.\r\n\r\n"I was sorry to notice," said he, "your shameful conduct in chapel\r\nyesterday afternoon.  As far as I could observe, you were making\r\nyourselves merry in that sacred place with the personal defects of\r\nothers.  The lessons you receive here must be futile indeed if they do\r\nnot teach you the duty of reverence to God, and courtesy to man.  It\r\ngives me special pain, Williams, to have observed that you, too, a boy\r\nhigh in your remove, were guilty of this most culpable levity.  You will\r\nall come to me at twelve o\'clock in the library."\r\n\r\nAt twelve o\'clock they each received a flogging.\r\n\r\nThe pain inflicted was not great, and Duncan and Llewellyn, who had got\r\ninto similar trouble before, cared very little for it, and went out\r\nlaughing to tell the number of swishes they had received to a little\r\ncrowd of boys who were lingering outside the library door.  But not so\r\nEric.  It was his _first_ flogging, and he felt it deeply.  To his proud\r\nspirit the disgrace was intolerable.  At that moment he hated Dr\r\nRowlands, he hated Mr Gordon, he hated his school-fellows, he hated\r\neverybody.  He had been flogged; the thought haunted him; he, Eric\r\nWilliams, had been forced to receive this most degrading corporal\r\npunishment.  He pushed fiercely through the knot of boys, and strode as\r\nquickly as he could along the playground, angry and impenitent.\r\n\r\nAt the gate Russell met him.  Eric felt the meeting inopportune; he was\r\nashamed to meet his friend, ashamed to speak to him, envious of him, and\r\njealous of his better reputation.  He wanted to pass him by without\r\nnotice, but Russell would not suffer this.  He came up to him and took\r\nhis arm affectionately.  The slightest allusion to his late disgrace\r\nwould have made Eric flame out into a passion; but Russell was too kind\r\nto allude to it then.  He talked as if nothing had happened, and tried\r\nto turn his friend\'s thoughts to more pleasant subjects.  Eric\r\nappreciated his kindness, but he was still sullen and fretful, and it\r\nwas not until they parted that his better feelings won the day.  But\r\nwhen Russell said to him, "Good-bye, Eric, and don\'t be down in the\r\nmouth," it was too much for him, and seizing Edwin\'s hand, he wrung it\r\nhard, and exclaimed impetuously--\r\n\r\n"How I wish I was like you, Edwin!  If all my friends were like you, I\r\nshould never get into these rows."\r\n\r\n"Nay, Eric," said Russell, "it\'s I who ought to envy you; you are no end\r\ncleverer and stronger, and you can\'t think how glad I am that we are\r\nfriends."\r\n\r\nThey parted by Mr Williams\'s door, and Russell walked home sad and\r\nthoughtful; but Eric, barely answering his brother\'s greeting, rushed up\r\nto his room, and, flinging himself on his bed, brooded alone over the\r\nremembrance of his disgrace.  Still nursing a fierce resentment, he felt\r\nsomething hard at his heart, and, as he prayed neither for help nor\r\nforgiveness, it was pride and rebellion, not penitence, that made him\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nHOME AFFECTIONS.\r\n\r\n  Keep the spell of home affection\r\n  Still alive in every heart;\r\n  May its power, with mild direction,\r\n  Draw our love from self apart,\r\n  Till thy children\r\n  Feel that thou their Father art.\r\n  _School Hymn_.\r\n\r\n"I have caught such a lot of pretty sea-anemones, Eric," said little\r\nVernon Williams, as his brother strolled in after morning school; "I\r\nwish you would come and look at them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t come now, Verny; I am going out to play cricket with some\r\nfellows directly."\r\n\r\n"But it won\'t take you a minute; do come."\r\n\r\n"What a little bore you are.  Where are the things?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind, Eric, if you don\'t want to look at them," said Vernon,\r\nhurt at his brother\'s rough manner.\r\n\r\n"First, you ask me to look, and then say `never mind,\'" said Eric\r\nimpatiently; "here, show me them."\r\n\r\nThe little boy brought a large saucer, round which the crimson\r\nsea-flowers were waving their long tentacula in the salt water.\r\n\r\n"Oh my; very pretty indeed.  But I must be off to cricket."\r\n\r\nVernon looked up at his brother sadly.\r\n\r\n"You aren\'t so kind to me, Eric, as you used to be."\r\n\r\n"What nonsense! and all because I don\'t admire those nasty red-jelly\r\nthings, which one may see on the shore by thousands any day.  What a\r\nlittle goose you are, Vernon."\r\n\r\nVernon made no reply, but was putting away his sea-anemones with a sigh,\r\nwhen in came Russell to fetch Eric to the cricket.\r\n\r\n"Well, Verny," he said, "have you been getting those pretty\r\nsea-anemones? come here and show me them.  Ah, I declare you\'ve got one\r\nof those famous white plumosa fellows among them.  What a lucky little\r\nchap you are!"\r\n\r\nVernon was delighted.\r\n\r\n"Mind you take care of them," said Russell.  "Where did you find them?"\r\n\r\n"I have been down the shore getting them."\r\n\r\n"And have you had a pleasant morning?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Russell, thank you.  Only it is rather dull being always by\r\nmyself, and Eric never comes with me now."\r\n\r\n"Hang Eric," said Russell playfully.  "Never mind, Verny; you and I will\r\ncut him, and go by ourselves."\r\n\r\nEric had stood by during the conversation, and the contrast of Russell\'s\r\nunselfish kindness with his own harsh want of sympathy struck him.  He\r\nthrew his arms round his brother\'s neck, and said, "We will both go with\r\nyou, Verny, next half-holiday."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, Eric," said his brother; and the two schoolboys ran out.\r\nBut when the next half-holiday came, warm and bright, with the promise\r\nof a good match that afternoon, Eric repented his promise, and left\r\nRussell to amuse his little brother, while he went off, as usual, to the\r\nplayground.\r\n\r\nThere was one silent witness of scenes like these, who laid them up\r\ndeeply in her heart.  Mrs Williams was not unobservant of the gradual\r\nbut steady falling off in Eric\'s character, and the first thing she\r\nnoticed was the blunting of his home affections.  When they first came\r\nto Roslyn, the boy used constantly to join his father and mother in\r\ntheir walks; but now he went seldom or never; and even if he did go, he\r\nseemed ashamed, while with them, to meet any of his school-fellows.  The\r\nspirit of false independence was awake and, growing in her darling son.\r\nThe bright afternoons they had spent together on the sunny shore, or\r\nseeking for sea-flowers among the lonely rocks of the neighbouring\r\nheadlands--the walks at evening and sunset among the hills, and the\r\nsweet counsel they had together, when the boy\'s character opened like a\r\nbud in the light and warmth of his mother\'s love--the long twilights\r\nwhen he would sit on a stool with his young head resting on her knees,\r\nand her loving hand in his fair hair--all these things were becoming to\r\nMrs Williams memories, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nIt was the trial of her life, and very sad to bear; the more so because\r\nthey were soon to be parted--certainly for years, perhaps for ever.  The\r\ntime was drawing nearer and nearer; it was now June, and Mr Williams\'s\r\nterm of furlough ended in two months.  The holidays at Roslyn were the\r\nmonths of July and August, and towards their close Mr and Mrs Williams\r\nintended to leave Vernon at Fairholm, and start for India--sending back\r\nEric by himself as a boarder in Dr Rowlands\'s house.\r\n\r\nAfter morning school, on fine days, the boys used to run straight down\r\nto the shore and bathe.  A bright and joyous scene it was.  They\r\nstripped off their clothes on the shingle that adjoined the beach, and\r\nthen, running along the sands, would swim out far into the bay till\r\ntheir heads looked like small dots glancing in the sunshine.  This year\r\nEric had learned to swim, and he enjoyed the bathing more than any other\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nOne day after they had dressed, Russell and he began to amuse themselves\r\non the sea-shore.  The little translucent pools left on the sands by the\r\nebbing tide always swarm with life, and the two boys found great fun in\r\nhunting audacious little crabs, or catching the shrimps that shuffled\r\nabout in the shallow water.  At last Eric picked up a piece of wood\r\nwhich he found lying on the beach, and said, "What do you say to coming\r\ncrab-fishing, Edwin? this bit of stick will do capitally to thrust\r\nbetween the rocks in the holes where they lie?"\r\n\r\nRussell agreed, and they started to the rocks of the Ness to seek a\r\nlikely place for their purpose.  The Ness was a mile off, but in the\r\nexcitement of their pleasure they were oblivious of time.\r\n\r\nThe Williamses, for the boys\' convenience, usually dined at one, but on\r\nthis day they waited half an hour for Eric.  Since, however, he didn\'t\r\nappear, they dined without him, supposing that he was accidentally\r\ndetained, and expecting him to come in every minute.  But two o\'clock\r\ncame, and no Eric; half-past two, and no Eric; three, but still no Eric.\r\nMrs Williams became seriously alarmed, and even her husband grew\r\nuneasy.\r\n\r\nVernon was watching for his brother at the window, and seeing Duncan\r\npass by, ran down to ask him, "If he knew where Eric was?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Duncan; "last time I saw him was on the shore.  We bathed\r\ntogether, and I remember his clothes were lying by mine when I dressed.\r\nBut I haven\'t seen him since.  If you like, we\'ll go and look for him.\r\nI daresay he\'s on the beach somewhere."\r\n\r\nBut they found no traces of him there; and when they returned with this\r\nintelligence, his mother got so agitated that it required all her\r\nhusband\'s firm gentleness to support her sinking spirits.  There was\r\nenough to cause anxiety, for Vernon repeatedly ran out to ask the boys\r\nwho were passing if they had seen his brother, and the answer always\r\nwas, that they had left him bathing in the sea.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our young friends, having caught several crabs, suddenly\r\nnoticed by the sun that it was getting late.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious, Edwin," said Eric, pulling out his watch, "it\'s\r\nhalf-past three; what have we been thinking of?  How frightened they\'ll\r\nbe at home," and running back as fast as they could, they reached the\r\nhouse at five o\'clock, and rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n"Eric, Eric," said Mrs Williams faintly, "where have you been? has\r\nanything happened to you, my child?"\r\n\r\n"No, mother, nothing.  I\'ve only been crab-fishing with Russell, and we\r\nforgot the time."\r\n\r\n"Thoughtless boy," said his father; "your mother has been in an agony\r\nabout you."\r\n\r\nEric saw her pale face and tearful eyes, and flung himself in her arms,\r\nand mother and son wept in a long embrace.  "Only two months," whispered\r\nMrs Williams, "and we shall leave you, dear boy, perhaps for ever.  Oh\r\ndo not forget your love for us in the midst of new companions."\r\n\r\nThe end of term arrived; this time Eric came out eighth only, instead of\r\nfirst, and therefore, on the prize-day, was obliged to sit among the\r\ncrowd of undistinguished boys.  He saw that his parents were\r\ndisappointed, and his own ambition was grievously mortified.  But he had\r\nfull confidence in his own powers, and made the strongest resolutions to\r\nwork hard the next half-year, when he had got out of "that Gordon\'s"\r\nclutches.\r\n\r\nThe Williamses spent the holidays at Fairholm, and now, indeed, in the\r\nprospect of losing them, Eric\'s feelings to his parents came out in all\r\ntheir strength.  Most happily the days glided by, and the father and\r\nmother used them wisely.  All their gentle influence, all their deep\r\naffection, were employed in leaving on the boy\'s heart lasting\r\nimpressions of godliness and truth.  He learnt to feel that their love\r\nwould encircle him for ever with its heavenly tenderness, and their pure\r\nprayers rise for him night and day to the throne of God.\r\n\r\nThe day of parting came, and most bitter and heart-rending it was.  In\r\nthe wildness of their passionate sorrow, Eric and Vernon seemed to hear\r\nthe sound of everlasting farewells.  It is God\'s mercy that ordains how\r\nseldom young hearts have to endure such misery.\r\n\r\nAt length it was over.  The last sound of wheels had died away; and\r\nduring those hours the hearts of parents and children felt the\r\nbitterness of death.  Mrs Trevor and Fanny, themselves filled with\r\ngrief, still used all their unselfish endeavours to comfort their dear\r\nboys.  Vernon, weary of crying, soon sank to sleep; but not so Eric.  He\r\nsat on a low stool, his face buried in his hands, breaking the stillness\r\nevery now and then with his convulsive sobs.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Aunty," he cried, "do you think I shall ever see them again?  I\r\nhave been so selfish, and so little grateful for all their love.  Oh, I\r\nwish I had thought at Roslyn how soon I was to lose them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, dearest," said Mrs Trevor, "I have no doubt we shall all meet\r\nagain soon.  Your father is only going for five years, you know, and\r\nthat will not seem very long.  And then they will be writing continually\r\nto us, and we to them.  Think, Eric, how gladdened their hearts will be\r\nto hear that you and Vernon are good boys, and getting on well."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I _will_ be a better boy, I _will_ indeed," said Eric; "I mean to\r\ndo great things, and they shall have nothing but good reports of me."\r\n\r\n"God helping you, dear," said his aunt, pushing back his hair from his\r\nforehead, and kissing it softly; "without His help, Eric, we are all\r\nweak indeed."\r\n\r\nShe sighed.  But how far deeper her sigh would have been had she known\r\nthe future.  Merciful is the darkness that shrouds it from human eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nERIC A BOARDER.\r\n\r\n  We were, fair queen,\r\n  Two lads that thought there was no more behind,\r\n  But such a day to-morrow as to-day,\r\n  And to be boy eternal.\r\n  _Winter\'s Tale_, i. 2.\r\n\r\nThe holidays were over.  Vernon was to have a tutor at Fairholm, and\r\nEric was to return alone, and be received into Dr Rowlands\'s house.\r\n\r\nAs he went on board the steam-packet, he saw numbers of the well-known\r\nfaces on deck, and merry voices greeted him.\r\n\r\n"Hullo, Williams! here you are at last," said Duncan, seizing his hand.\r\n"How have you enjoyed the holidays?  It\'s so jolly to see you again."\r\n\r\n"So you\'re coming as a boarder," said Montagu, "and to our noble house,\r\ntoo.  Mind you stick up for it, old fellow.  Come along, and let\'s watch\r\nwhether the boats are bringing any more fellows; we shall be starting in\r\na few minutes."\r\n\r\n"Ha! there\'s Russell," said Eric, springing to the gangway, and warmly\r\nshaking his friend\'s hand as he came on board.\r\n\r\n"Have your father and mother gone, Eric?" said Russell, after a few\r\nminutes\' talk.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Eric, turning away his head, and hastily brushing his eyes.\r\n"They are on their way back to India."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so sorry," said Russell; "I don\'t think any one has ever been so\r\nkind to me as they were."\r\n\r\n"And they loved you, Edwin, dearly, and told me almost the last thing\r\nthat they hoped we should always be friends.  Stop! they gave me\r\nsomething for you."  Eric opened his carpet-bag, and took out a little\r\nbox carefully wrapped up, which he gave to Russell.  It contained a\r\npretty silver watch, and inside the case was engraved--"Edwin Russell,\r\nfrom the mother of his friend Eric."\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s eyes glistened with joyful surprise.  "How good they are," he\r\nsaid; "I shall write and thank Mrs Williams directly we get to Roslyn."\r\n\r\nThey had a fine bright voyage, and arrived that night.  Eric, as a\r\nnewcomer, was ushered at once into Dr Rowlands\'s drawing-room, where\r\nthe head-master was sitting with his wife and children.  His greeting\r\nwas dignified, but not unkindly; and, on saying "good-night," he gave\r\nEric a few plain words of affectionate advice.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Eric hardly cared for advice.  He was full of life and\r\nspirits, brave, bright, impetuous, tingling with hope, in the very flush\r\nof boyhood.  He bounded down the stairs, and in another minute entered\r\nthe large room where all Dr Rowlands\'s boarders assembled, and where\r\nmost of them lived, except the few privileged sixth-form, and other boys\r\nwho had "studies."  A cheer greeted his entrance into the room.  By this\r\ntime most of the Rowlandites knew him, and were proud to have him among\r\ntheir number.  They knew that he was clever enough to get them credit in\r\nthe school, and, what was better still, that he would be a capital\r\naccession of strength to the cricket and football.  Except Barker, there\r\nwas not one who had not a personal liking for him, and on this occasion\r\neven Barker was gracious.\r\n\r\nThe room in which Eric found himself was large and high.  At one end was\r\na huge fireplace, and there was generally a throng of boys round the\r\ngreat iron fender, where, in cold weather, a little boy could seldom\r\nfind room.  The large windows opened on the green playground; and iron\r\nbars prevented any exit through them.  This large room, called "the\r\nboarders\' room," was the joint habitation of Eric and some thirty other\r\nboys; and at one side ran a range of shelves and drawers, where they\r\nkept their books and private property.  There the younger Rowlandites\r\nbreakfasted, dined, had tea, and, for the most part, lived.  Here, too,\r\nthey had to get through all such work as was not performed under direct\r\nsupervision.  How many and what varied scenes had not that room beheld!\r\nhad those dumb walls any feeling, what worlds of life and experience\r\nthey would have acquired!  If against each boy\'s name, as it was rudely\r\ncut on the oak panels, could have been also cut the fate that had\r\nbefallen him, the good that he had there learnt, the evil that he there\r\nhad suffered--what _noble_ histories would the records unfold of honour\r\nand success, of baffled temptations and hard-won triumphs; what _awful_\r\nhistories of hopes blighted and habits learned, of wasted talents and\r\nruined lives.\r\n\r\nThe routine of school-life was on this wise:--At half-past seven the\r\nboys came down to prayers, which were immediately followed by breakfast.\r\nAt nine they went into school, where they continued, with little\r\ninterruption, till twelve.  At one they dined, and, except on\r\nhalf-holidays, went into school again from two till five.  The lock-up\r\nbell rang at dusk; at six o\'clock they had tea--which was a repetition\r\nof breakfast, with leave to add to it whatever else they liked--and\r\nimmediately after sat down to "preparation," which lasted from seven\r\ntill nine.  During this time one of the masters was always in the room,\r\nwho allowed them to read amusing books or employ themselves in any other\r\nquiet way they liked, as soon as ever they had learnt their lessons for\r\nthe following day.  At nine Dr Rowlands came in and read prayers, after\r\nwhich the boys were dismissed to bed.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the dormitories was peculiar.  They were a suite of\r\nrooms, exactly the same size, each opening into the other; six on each\r\nside of a lavatory, which occupied the space between them, so that, when\r\nall the doors were open, you could see from one end of the whole range\r\nto the other.  The only advantage of this arrangement was, that one\r\nmaster walking up and down could keep all the boys in order while they\r\nwere getting into bed.  About a quarter of an hour was allowed for this\r\nprocess, and then the master went along the rooms putting out the\r\nlights.  A few of the "study-boys" were allowed to sit up till half-past\r\nten, and their bedrooms were elsewhere.  The consequence was, that in\r\nthese dormitories the boys felt perfectly secure from any interruption.\r\nThere were only two ways by which a master could get at them--one up the\r\ngreat staircase, and through the lavatory; the other by a door at the\r\nextreme end of the range, which led into Dr Rowlands\'s house, but was\r\ngenerally kept locked.\r\n\r\nIn each dormitory slept four or five boys, distributed by their order in\r\nthe school list, so that, in all the dormitories, there were nearly\r\nsixty; and of these a goodly number were, on Eric\'s arrival, collected\r\nin the boarders\' room, the rest being in their studies, or in the\r\nclassrooms, which some were allowed to use in order to prevent too great\r\na crowd in the room below.\r\n\r\nAt nine o\'clock the prayer-bell rang.  This was the signal for all the\r\nboarders to take their seats for prayers, each with an open Bible before\r\nhim; and when the school-servants had also come in, Dr Rowlands read a\r\nchapter, and offered up an extempore prayer.  While reading, he\r\ngenerally interspersed a few pointed remarks or graphic explanations,\r\nand Eric learnt much in this simple way.  The prayer, though short, was\r\nalways well suited to the occasion, and calculated to carry with it the\r\nattention of the worshippers.\r\n\r\nPrayers over, the boys noisily dispersed to their bedrooms, and Eric\r\nfound himself placed in a room immediately to the right of the lavatory,\r\noccupied by Duncan, Graham, Llewellyn, and two other boys named Ball and\r\nAttlay, all in the same form with himself.  They were all tired with\r\ntheir voyage and the excitement of coming back to school, so that they\r\ndid not talk much that night, and before long Eric was fast asleep,\r\ndreaming, dreaming, dreaming that he should have a very happy life at\r\nRoslyn School, and seeing himself win no end of distinctions, and make\r\nno end of new friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTAKING UP.\r\n\r\n  We are not worst at once; the course of evil\r\n  Begins so slowly, and from such slight source,\r\n  An infant\'s hand might stop the breach with clay;\r\n  But let the stream grow wider, and Philosophy,\r\n  Ay, and Religion too--may strive in vain\r\n  To stem the headlong current!\r\n  _Anon_.\r\n\r\nWith intense delight Eric heard it announced next morning, when the new\r\nschool list was read, that he had got his remove into the "Shell," as\r\nthe form was called which intervened between the fourth and the fifth.\r\nRussell, Owen, and Montagu also got their removes with him, but his\r\nother friends were left for the present in the form below.\r\n\r\nMr Rose, his new master, was in every respect a great contrast with Mr\r\nGordon.  He was not so brilliant in his acquirements, nor so vigorous in\r\nhis teaching, and therefore clever boys did not catch fire from him so\r\nmuch as from the fourth-form master.  But he was a far truer and deeper\r\nChristian; and, with no less scrupulous a sense of honour and\r\ndetestation of every form of moral obliquity, he never yielded to those\r\nstorms of passionate indignation which Mr Gordon found it impossible to\r\ncontrol.  Disappointed in early life, subjected to the deepest and most\r\npainful trials, Mr Rose\'s fine character had come out like gold from\r\nthe flame.  He now lived in and for the boys alone, and his whole life\r\nwas one long self-devotion to their service and interests.  The boys\r\nfelt this, and even the worst of them, in their worst moments, loved and\r\nhonoured Mr Rose.  But he was not seeking for gratitude, which he\r\nneither expected nor required; he asked no affection in return for his\r\nself-denials; he worked with a pure spirit of human and self-sacrificing\r\nlove, happy beyond all payment if ever he were instrumental in saving\r\none of his charge from evil, or turning one wanderer from the error of\r\nhis ways.\r\n\r\nHe was an unmarried man, and therefore took no boarders himself; but\r\nlived in the school buildings, and had the care of the boys in Dr\r\nRowlands\'s house.\r\n\r\nSuch was the master under whom Eric was now placed, and the boy was\r\nsadly afraid that an evil report would have reached his ears, and given\r\nhim already an unfavourable impression.  But he was soon happily\r\nundeceived.  Mr Rose at once addressed him with much kindness, and he\r\nfelt that, however bad he had been before, he would now have an\r\nopportunity to turn over a new leaf, and begin again a career of hope.\r\nHe worked admirably at first, and even beat, for the first week or two,\r\nhis old competitors, Owen and Russell.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Mr Rose took a deep interest in him.  Few could\r\nlook at the boy\'s bright blue eyes and noble face without doing so, and\r\nthe more when they knew that his father and mother were thousands of\r\nmiles away, leaving him alone in the midst of so many dangers.  Often\r\nthe master asked him, and Russell and Owen and Montagu, to supper with\r\nhim in the library, which gave them the privilege of sitting up later\r\nthan usual, and enjoying a more quiet and pleasant evening than was\r\npossible in the noisy rooms.  Boys and master were soon quite at home\r\nwith each other, and in this way Mr Rose had an opportunity of\r\ninstilling many a useful warning without the formality of regular\r\ndiscipline or stereotyped instruction.\r\n\r\nEric found the life of the "boarders\' room" far rougher than he had\r\nexpected.  Work was out of the question there, except during the hours\r\nof preparation, and the long dark winter evenings were often dull\r\nenough.  Sometimes, indeed, they would all join in some regular indoor\r\nboys\' game like "baste the bear," or "high-cockolorum"; or they would\r\nhave amusing "ghost-hunts," as they called them, after some dressed-up\r\nboy among the dark corridors and staircases.  This was good fun, but at\r\nother times they got tired of games, and could not get them up, and then\r\nnumbers of boys felt the idle time hang heavy on their hands.  When this\r\nwas the case, some of the worst sort, as might have been expected, would\r\nfill up their leisure with bullying or mischief.\r\n\r\nFor some time they had a form of diversion which disgusted and annoyed\r\nEric exceedingly.  On each of the long iron-bound deal tables were\r\nplaced two or three tallow candles in tin candlesticks, and this was the\r\nonly light the boys had.  Of course these candles often wanted snuffing,\r\nand as snuffers were sure to be thrown about and broken as soon as they\r\nwere brought into the room, the only resource was to snuff them with the\r\nfingers, at which all the boys became great adepts, from necessity.  One\r\nevening Barker, having snuffed the candle, suddenly and slyly put the\r\nsmouldering wick unnoticed on the head of a little quiet inoffensive\r\nfellow named Wright, who happened to be sitting next to him.  It went on\r\nsmouldering for some time without Wright\'s perceiving it, and at last\r\nBarker, highly delighted, exclaimed--"I see a chimney," and laughed.\r\n\r\nFour or five boys looked up, and very soon every one in the room had\r\nnoticed the trick except little Wright himself, who unconsciously toiled\r\non at the letter he was sending home.\r\n\r\nEric did not like this, but not wishing to come across Barker again,\r\nsaid nothing, and affected not to have observed.  But Russell said\r\nquietly, "There\'s something on your head, Wright," and the little boy,\r\nputting up his hand, hastily brushed off the horrid wick.\r\n\r\n"What a shame," he said, as it fell on his letter, and made a smudge.\r\n\r\n"Who told you to interfere?" said Barker, turning fiercely to Russell.\r\nRussell, as usual, took not the slightest notice of him, and Barker,\r\nafter a little more bluster, repeated the trick on another boy.  This\r\ntime Russell thought that every one might be on the look-out for\r\nhimself, and so went on with his work.  But when Barker again chanted\r\nmaliciously--\r\n\r\n"I see a chimney!" every boy who happened to be reading or writing,\r\nuneasily felt to discover whether this time he were himself the victim\r\nor no; and so things continued for half an hour.\r\n\r\nRidiculous and disgusting as this folly was, it became, when constantly\r\nrepeated, very annoying.  A boy could not sit down to any quiet work\r\nwithout constant danger of having some one creep up behind him and put\r\nthe offensive fragment of smoking snuff on his head; and neither Barker\r\nnor any of his little gang of imitators seemed disposed to give up their\r\nlow mischief.\r\n\r\nOne night, when the usual exclamation was made, Eric felt sure, from\r\nseeing several boys looking at him, that this time some one had been\r\ntreating him in the same way.  He indignantly shook his head, and sure\r\nenough the bit of wick dropped off.  Eric was furious, and, springing\r\nup, he shouted--\r\n\r\n"By Jove!  I _won\'t_ stand this any longer."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to sit it, then," said Barker.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was you who did it, was it?  Then take that!" and seizing one of\r\nthe tin candlesticks, Eric hurled it at Barker\'s head.  Barker dodged,\r\nbut the edge of it cut open his eyebrow as it whizzed by, and the blood\r\nflowed fast.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll kill you for that," said Barker, leaping at Eric, and seizing him\r\nby the hair.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll get killed yourself then, you brute," said Upton, Russell\'s\r\ncousin, a fifth-form boy, who had just come into the room--and he boxed\r\nBarker\'s ears as a premonitory admonition.  "But I say, young \'un,"\r\ncontinued he to Eric, "this kind of thing won\'t do, you know.  You\'ll\r\nget into rows if you shy candlesticks at fellows\' heads at that rate."\r\n\r\n"He has been making the room intolerable for the last month by his\r\nfilthy tricks," said Eric hotly; "some one must stop him, and I will\r\nsomehow, if no one else does."\r\n\r\n"It wasn\'t I who put the thing on your head, you passionate young fool,"\r\ngrowled Barker.\r\n\r\n"Who was it, then? how was I to know?  You began it."\r\n\r\n"You shut up, Barker," said Upton; "I\'ve heard of your ways before, and\r\nwhen I catch you at your tricks, I\'ll teach you a lesson.  Come up to my\r\nstudy, Williams, if you like."\r\n\r\nUpton was a fine sturdy fellow of eighteen, immensely popular in the\r\nschool for his prowess and good looks.  He hated bullying, and often\r\ninterfered to protect little boys, who accordingly idolised him, and did\r\nanything he told them very willingly.  He meant to do no harm, but he\r\ndid great harm.  He was full of misdirected impulses, and had a great\r\nnotion of being manly, which he thought consisted in a fearless\r\ndisregard of all school rules, and the performance of the wildest\r\ntricks.  For this reason he was never very intimate with his cousin\r\nRussell, whom he liked very much, but who was too scrupulous and\r\nindependent to please him.  Eric, on the other hand, was just the boy to\r\ntake his fancy, and to admire him in return; his life, strength, and\r\npluck made him a ready pupil in all schemes of mischief, and Upton, who\r\nhad often noticed him, would have been the first to shudder had he known\r\nhow far his example went to undermine all Eric\'s lingering good\r\nresolutions, and injure permanently the boy of whom he was so fond.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Eric was much in Upton\'s study, and constantly by his\r\nside in the playground.  In spite of their disparity in age and position\r\nin the school, they became sworn friends, though their friendship was\r\nbroken every now and then by little quarrels, which united them all the\r\nmore closely after they had not spoken to each other perhaps for a week.\r\n\r\n"Your, cousin Upton has `taken up\' Williams," said Montagu to Russell\r\none afternoon, as he saw the two strolling together on the beach, with\r\nEric\'s arm in Upton\'s.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am sorry for it."\r\n\r\n"So am I.  We shan\'t see so much of him now."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s not my only reason," answered Russell, who had a rare habit\r\nof always going straight to the point.\r\n\r\n"You mean you don\'t like the `taking up\' system."\r\n\r\n"No, Montagu; I used once to have fine theories about it.  I used to\r\nfancy that a big fellow would do no end of good to one lower in the\r\nschool, and that the two would stand to each other in the relation of\r\nknight to squire.  You know what the young knights were taught, Monty--\r\nto keep their bodies under, and bring them into subjection; to love God,\r\nand speak the truth always.  That sounds very grand and noble to me.\r\nBut when a big fellow takes up a little one, _you_ know pretty well that\r\n_those_ are not the kind of lessons he teaches."\r\n\r\n"No, Russell; you\'re quite right.  It\'s bad for a fellow in every way.\r\nFirst of all, it keeps him in an unnatural sort of dependence; then ten\r\nto one it makes him conceited, and prevents his character from really\r\ncoming out well.  And besides, the young chap generally gets paid out in\r\nkicks and abuse from the jealousy and contempt of the rest; and if his\r\nprotector happens to leave, or anything of that kind, woe betide him!"\r\n\r\n"No fear for Eric in that line, though," said Russell; "he can hold his\r\nown pretty well against any one.  And after all, he is a most jolly\r\nfellow.  I don\'t think even Upton would spoil him; it\'s chiefly the soft\r\nself-indulgent fellows, who are all straw and no iron, who get spoilt by\r\nbeing `taken up.\'"\r\n\r\nRussell was partly right.  Eric learned a great deal of harm from Upton,\r\nand the misapplied hero-worship led to bad results.  But he was too\r\nmanly a little fellow, and had too much self-respect, to sink into the\r\ndependent condition which usually grows on the foolish little boys who\r\nhave the misfortune to be "taken up."\r\n\r\nNor did he in the least drop his old friends, except Owen.  A coolness\r\ngrew up between the latter and Eric, not unmingled with a little mutual\r\ncontempt.  Eric sneered at Owen as a fellow who did nothing but grind\r\nall day long, and had no geniality in him; while Owen pitied the love of\r\npopularity which so often led Eric into delinquencies, which he himself\r\ndespised.  Owen had, indeed, but few friends in the school; the only boy\r\nwho knew him well enough to respect and like him thoroughly was Russell,\r\nwho found in him the only one who took the same high ground with\r\nhimself.  But Russell loved the good in every one, and was loved by all\r\nin return, and Eric he loved most of all, while he often mourned over\r\nhis increasing failures.\r\n\r\nOne day as the two were walking together in the green playground, Mr\r\nGordon passed by; and as the boys touched their caps, he nodded and\r\nsmiled pleasantly at Russell, but hardly noticed, and did not return\r\nEric\'s salute.  He had begun to dislike the latter more and more, and\r\nhad given him up altogether as one of the reprobates.  Barker, who\r\nhappened to pass at the same moment, received from him the same cold\r\nglance that Eric had done.\r\n\r\n"What a surly devil that is," said Eric, when he had passed; "did you\r\nsee how he purposely cut me?"\r\n\r\n"A surly...?  Oh, Eric, that\'s the first time I ever heard you swear."\r\n\r\nEric blushed.  He hadn\'t meant the word to slip out in Russell\'s\r\nhearing, though similar and worse expressions were common enough in his\r\ntalk with other boys.  But he didn\'t like to be reproved, even by\r\nRussell, and in the ready spirit of self-defence, he answered--\r\n\r\n"Pooh, Edwin, you don\'t call that swearing, do you?  You\'re so strict,\r\nso religious, you know.  I love you for it, but then, there are none\r\nlike you.  Nobody thinks anything of swearing here,--even of _real_\r\nswearing, you know."\r\n\r\nRussell was silent.\r\n\r\n"Besides, what can be the harm of it? it means nothing.  I was thinking\r\nthe other night, and I made out that you and Owen are the only two\r\nfellows here who don\'t swear."\r\n\r\nRussell still said nothing.\r\n\r\n"And, after all, I didn\'t swear; I only called that fellow a surly\r\ndevil."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush!  Eric, hush!" said Russell sadly.  "You wouldn\'t have said so\r\nhalf a year ago."\r\n\r\nEric knew what he meant.  The image of his father and mother rose before\r\nhim, as they sate far away in their lonely Indian home, thinking of him,\r\npraying for him, centring all their hopes in him.  In him!--and he knew\r\nhow many things he was daily doing and saying, which would cut them to\r\nthe heart.  He knew that all his moral consciousness was fast vanishing,\r\nand leaving him a bad and reckless boy.\r\n\r\nIn a moment all this passed through his mind.  He remembered how shocked\r\nhe had been at swearing at first; and even when it became too familiar\r\nto shock him, how he determined never to fall into the habit himself.\r\nThen he remembered how gradually it had become quite a graceful sound in\r\nhis ears--a sound of entire freedom and independence of moral restraint;\r\nan open casting off, as it were, of all authority, so that he had begun\r\nto admire it, particularly in Duncan, and, above all, in his new hero,\r\nUpton; and he recollected how, at last, an oath had one day slipped out\r\nsuddenly in his own words, and how strange it sounded to him, and how\r\nUpton smiled to hear it, though his own conscience had reproached him\r\nbitterly; but now that he had done it once, it became less dreadful, and\r\ngradually grew common enough, till even conscience hardly reminded him\r\nthat he was doing wrong.\r\n\r\nHe thought of all this, and hung his head.  Pride struggled with him for\r\na moment, but at length he answered, "Oh, Edwin, you\'re quite right, and\r\nI\'m all in the wrong as usual.  But I shall never be like you," he added\r\nin a low sad tone.\r\n\r\n"Dear Eric, don\'t think that I\'m always sermonising.  But I hope that I\r\nknow the difference between what\'s right and what\'s wrong, and do let me\r\nsay that you will be so much happier, if you try not to yield to all the\r\nbad things round us.  Remember, I know more of school than you."\r\n\r\nThe two boys strolled on silently.  That night Eric knelt at his\r\nbedside, and prayed as he had not done for many a long day.\r\n\r\nAnd here let those scoff who deny "the sinfulness of little sins"--but I\r\nremember the words of one who wrote, that:\r\n\r\n  The most childish thing which man can do,\r\n  Is yet a sin which Jesus never did\r\n  When Jesus was a child,--and yet a sin\r\n  For which in lowly pain he came to die\r\n  That for the _bravest_ sin that e\'er was praised\r\n  The King Eternal wore the crown of thorns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\n"DEAD FLIES," OR "YE SHALL BE AS GODS".\r\n\r\n  In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night.\r\n  Proverbs seven, 9.\r\n\r\nAt Roslyn, even in summer, the hour for going to bed was half-past nine.\r\nIt was hardly likely that so many boys, overflowing with turbulent\r\nlife, should lie down quietly, and get to sleep.  They never dreamt of\r\ndoing so.  Very soon after the masters were gone, the sconces were often\r\nrelighted, sometimes in separate dormitories, sometimes in all of them,\r\nand the boys amused themselves by reading novels or making a row.  They\r\nwould play various games about the bedrooms, vaulting or jumping over\r\nthe beds, running races in sheets, getting through the windows upon the\r\nroofs, to frighten the study-boys with sham ghosts, or playing the\r\nthousand other pranks which suggested themselves to the fertile\r\nimagination of fifteen.  But the favourite amusement was a bolstering\r\nmatch.  One room would challenge another, and stripping the covers off\r\ntheir bolsters, would meet in mortal fray.  A bolster well wielded,\r\nespecially when dexterously applied to the legs, is a very efficient\r\ninstrument to bring a boy to the ground; but it doesn\'t hurt very much,\r\neven when the blows fall on the head.  Hence these matches were\r\nexcellent trials of strength and temper, and were generally accompanied\r\nwith shouts of laughter, never ending until one side was driven back to\r\nits own room.  Many a long and tough struggle had Eric enjoyed, and his\r\nprowess was now so universally acknowledged, that his dormitory, Number\r\n7, was a match for any other, and far stronger in this warfare than most\r\nof the rest.  At bolstering.  Duncan was a perfect champion; his\r\nstrength and activity were marvellous, and his mirth uproarious.  Eric\r\nand Graham backed him up brilliantly; while Llewellyn and Attlay, with\r\nsturdy vigour, supported the skirmishers.  Ball, the sixth boy in Number\r\n7, was the only _faineant_ among them, though he did occasionally help\r\nto keep off the smaller fry.\r\n\r\nHappy would it have been for all of them if Ball had never been placed\r\nin Number 7; happier still if he had never come to Roslyn School.\r\nBackward in work, overflowing with vanity at his supposed good looks, of\r\nmean disposition and feeble intellect, he was the very worst specimen of\r\na boy that Eric had ever seen.  Not even Barker so deeply excited Eric\'s\r\nrepulsion and contempt.  And yet, since the affair of Upton, Barker and\r\nEric were declared enemies, and, much to the satisfaction of the latter,\r\nnever spoke to each other; but with Ball--much as he inwardly loathed\r\nhim--he was professedly and apparently on good terms.  His silly love of\r\nuniversal popularity made him accept and tolerate the society even of\r\nthis worthless boy.\r\n\r\nAny two boys talking to each other about Ball would probably profess to\r\nlike him "well enough," but if they were honest, they would generally\r\nend by allowing their contempt.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got a nice set in Number 7, haven\'t we?" said Duncan to Eric one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n"Capital.  Old Llewellyn\'s a stunner, and I like Attlay and Graham."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you like Ball, then?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; pretty well."\r\n\r\nThe two boys looked each other in the face, and then, like the\r\nconfidential augurs, burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n"You know you detest him," said Duncan.\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t.  He never did me any harm that I know of."\r\n\r\n"Hm!--well, _I_ detest him."\r\n\r\n"Well!" answered Eric, "on coming to think of it, so do I.  And yet he\'s\r\npopular enough in the school.  I wonder how that is."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not _really_ popular.  I\'ve often noticed that fellows pretty\r\ngenerally despise him, yet somehow don\'t like to say so."\r\n\r\n"Why do you dislike him, Duncan?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  Why do you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know either."\r\n\r\nNeither Eric nor Duncan meant this answer to be false, and yet if they\r\nhad taken the trouble to consider, they would have found out in their\r\nsecret souls the reasons of their dislike.\r\n\r\nBall had been to school before, and of this school he often bragged as\r\nthe acme of desirability and wickedness.  He was always telling boys\r\nwhat they did at "his old school," and he quite inflamed the minds of\r\nsuch as fell under his influence by marvellous tales of the wild and\r\nwilful things which he and his former school-fellows had done.  Many and\r\nmany a scheme of sin and mischief at Roslyn was suggested, planned, and\r\ncarried out, on the model of Ball\'s reminiscences of his previous life.\r\n\r\nHe had tasted more largely of the tree of the knowledge of evil than any\r\nother boy, and, strange to say, this was the secret why the general\r\nodium was never expressed.  He claimed his guilty experience so often as\r\na ground of superiority, that at last the claim was silently allowed.\r\nHe spoke from the platform of more advanced iniquity, and the others\r\nlistened first curiously, and then eagerly to his words.\r\n\r\n"Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."  Such was the temptation\r\nwhich assailed the other boys in dormitory Number 7; and Eric among the\r\nnumber.  Ball was the tempter.  Secretly, gradually, he dropped into\r\ntheir too willing ears the poison of his immorality.\r\n\r\nIn brief, this boy was cursed with a degraded and corrupting mind.\r\n\r\nI hurry over a part of my subject inconceivably painful; I hurry over\r\nit, but if I am to perform my self-imposed duty of giving a true\r\npicture, of what school-life _sometimes_ is, I must not pass it by\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThe first time that Eric heard indecent words in dormitory Number 7, he\r\nwas shocked beyond bound or measure.  Dark though it was, he felt\r\nhimself blushing scarlet to the roots of his hair, and then growing pale\r\nagain, while a hot dew was left upon his forehead.  Ball was the\r\nspeaker; but this time there was a silence, and the subject instantly\r\ndropped.  The others felt that a "new boy" was in the room; they did not\r\nknow how he would take it; they were unconsciously abashed.\r\n\r\nBesides, though they had themselves joined in such conversation before,\r\nthey did not love it, and, on the contrary, felt ashamed of yielding to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow, Eric, now or never!  Life and death, ruin and salvation, corruption\r\nand purity, are perhaps in the balance together, and the scale of your\r\ndestiny may hang on a single word of yours.  Speak out, boy!  Tell these\r\nfellows that unseemly words wound your conscience; tell them that they\r\nare ruinous, sinful, damnable; speak out and save yourself and the rest.\r\nVirtue is strong and beautiful, Eric, and vice is downcast in her awful\r\npresence.  Lose your purity of heart, Eric, and you have lost a jewel\r\nwhich the whole world, if it were "one entire and perfect chrysolite,"\r\ncannot replace.\r\n\r\nGood spirits guard that young boy, and give him grace in this his hour\r\nof trial!  Open his eyes that he may see the fiery horses and the fiery\r\nchariots of the angels who would defend him, and the dark array of\r\nspiritual foes who throng around his bed.  Point a pitying finger to the\r\nyawning abyss of shame, ruin, and despair that even now perhaps is being\r\ncleft under his feet.  Show him the garlands of the present and the\r\npast, withering at the touch of the Erinnys in the future.  In pity, in\r\npity, show him the canker which he is introducing into the sap of the\r\ntree of life, which shall cause its root to be hereafter as bitterness,\r\nand its blossom to go up as dust.\r\n\r\nBut the sense of sin was on Eric\'s mind.  How _could_ he speak? was not\r\nhis own language sometimes profane?  How--how could he profess to\r\nreprove another boy on the ground of morality, when he himself said and\r\ndid things less dangerous perhaps, but equally forbidden?\r\n\r\nFor half an hour, in an agony of struggle with himself, Eric lay silent.\r\nSince Ball\'s last words nobody had spoken.  They were going to sleep.\r\nIt was too late to speak now, Eric thought.  The moment passed by for\r\never; Eric had listened without objection to foul words, and the\r\nirreparable harm was done.\r\n\r\nHow easy it would have been to speak!  With the temptation, God had\r\nprovided also a way to escape.  Next time it came, it was far harder to\r\nresist, and it soon became, to men, impossible.\r\n\r\nAh, Eric, Eric! how little we know the moments which decide the\r\ndestinies of life.  We live on as usual.  The day is a common day, the\r\nhour a common hour.  We never thought twice about the change of\r\nintention which by one of the accidents--(accidents!)--of life\r\ndetermined for good or for evil, for happiness or misery, the colour of\r\nour remaining years.  The stroke of the pen was done in a moment which\r\nled unconsciously to our ruin; the word was uttered quite heedlessly on\r\nwhich turned for ever the decision of our weal or woe.\r\n\r\nEric lay silent.  The darkness was not broken by the flashing of an\r\nangel\'s wing, the stillness was not syllabled by the sound of an angel\'s\r\nvoice; but to his dying day Eric never forgot the moments which passed,\r\nuntil, weary and self-reproachful, he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning he awoke, restless and feverish.  He at once remembered\r\nwhat had passed.  Ball\'s words haunted him; he could not forget them;\r\nthey burnt within him like the flame of a moral fever.  He was moody and\r\npetulant, and for a time could hardly conceal his aversion.  Ah, Eric!\r\nmoodiness and petulance cannot save you, but prayerfulness would; one\r\nword, Eric, at the throne of grace--one prayer before you go down among\r\nthe boys, that God in His mercy would wash away, in the blood of His\r\ndear Son, your crimson stains, and keep your conscience and memory\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nThe boy knelt down for a few minutes, and repeated to himself a few\r\nformal words.  Had he stayed longer on his knees, he might have given\r\nway to a burst of penitence and supplication--but he heard Ball\'s\r\nfootstep, and getting up he ran downstairs to breakfast; so Eric did not\r\npray.\r\n\r\nConversations did not generally drop so suddenly in dormitory Number 7.\r\nOn the contrary, they generally flashed along in the liveliest way, till\r\nsome one said "good-night;" and then the boys turned off to sleep.  Eric\r\nknew this, and instantly conjectured that it was only a sort of respect\r\nfor him, and ignorance of the manner in which he would consider it, that\r\nprevented Duncan and the rest from taking any further notice of Ball\'s\r\nremark.  It was therefore no good disburdening his mind to any of them;\r\nbut he determined to speak about the matter to Russell in their next\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\nThey usually walked together on Sunday.  Dr Rowlands had discontinued\r\nthe odious and ridiculous custom of the younger boys taking their\r\nexercise under a master\'s inspection.  Boys are not generally fond of\r\nconstitutionals, so that on the half-holidays they almost entirely\r\nconfined their open-air exercise to the regular games, and many of them\r\nhardly left the playground boundaries once a week.  But on Sundays they\r\noften went walks, each with his favourite friend or companion.  When\r\nEric first came as a boarder, he invariably went with Russell on Sunday,\r\nand many a pleasant stroll they had taken together, sometimes\r\naccompanied by Duncan, Montagu, or Owen.  The latter, however, had\r\ndropped even this intercourse with Eric, who for the last few weeks had\r\nmore often gone with his new friend Upton.\r\n\r\n"Come a walk, boy," said Upton, as they left the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"Oh, excuse me to-day, Upton," said Eric, "I\'m going with your cousin."\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well," said Upton, in high dudgeon; and hoping to make Eric\r\njealous, he went a walk with Graham, whom he had "taken up" before he\r\nknew Williams.\r\n\r\nRussell was rather surprised when Eric came to him and said, "Come a\r\nstroll to Fort Island, Edwin--will you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Russell cheerfully; "why, we haven\'t seen each other for\r\nsome time lately!  I was beginning to fancy that you meant to drop me,\r\nEric."\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a smile and in a rallying tone, but Eric hung his head;\r\nfor the charge was true.  Proud of his popularity among all the school,\r\nand especially at his friendship with so leading a fellow as Upton, Eric\r\nhad _not_ seen much of his friend since their last conversation about\r\nswearing.  Indeed, conscious of failure, he felt sometimes uneasy in\r\nRussell\'s company.\r\n\r\nHe faltered, and answered humbly, "I hope you will never drop _me_,\r\nEdwin, whatever happens to me.  But I particularly want to speak to you\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nIn an instant Russell had twined his arm in Eric\'s as they turned\r\ntowards Fort Island; and Eric, with an effort, was just going to begin\r\nwhen they heard Montagu\'s voice calling after them--\r\n\r\n"I say, you fellows, where are you off to? may I come with you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, Monty, do," said Russell; "it will be quite like old times; now\r\nthat my cousin Horace has got hold of Eric, we have to sing `When shall\r\nwe three meet again?\'"\r\n\r\nRussell only spoke in fun; but, unintentionally, his words jarred in\r\nEric\'s heart.  He was silent and answered in monosyllables, so the walk\r\nwas provokingly dull.  At last they reached Fort Island, and sate down\r\nby the ruined chapel looking on the sea.\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s the row with you, old boy?" said Montagu, playfully shaking\r\nEric by the shoulder; "you\'re as silent as Zimmerman on Solitude, and as\r\ndoleful as Harvey on the Tombs.  I expect you\'ve been going through a\r\nselect course of Blair\'s Grave, Young\'s Night Thoughts, and Drelincourt\r\non Death."\r\n\r\nTo his surprise Eric\'s head was still bent, and, at last, he heard a\r\ndeep suppressed sigh.\r\n\r\n"My dear fellow, what is the matter with you?" said Russell,\r\naffectionately taking his hand; "surely you\'re not offended at my\r\nnonsense?"\r\n\r\nEric had not liked to speak while Montagu was by, but now he gulped down\r\nhis rising emotion, and briefly told them of Ball\'s vile words the night\r\nbefore.  They listened in silence.\r\n\r\n"I knew it must come, Eric," said Russell at last, "and I am so sorry\r\nyou didn\'t speak at the time."\r\n\r\n"Do the fellows ever talk in that way in either of your dormitories?"\r\nasked Eric.\r\n\r\n"No," said Russell.\r\n\r\n"Very little," said Montagu.\r\n\r\nA pause followed, during which all three plucked the grass and looked\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you," said Russell solemnly; "my father (he is dead now,\r\nyou know, Eric), when I was sent to school, warned me of this kind of\r\nthing.  I had been brought up in utter ignorance of such coarse\r\nknowledge as is forced upon one here, and with my reminiscences of home,\r\nI could not bear even that much of it which it was impossible to avoid.\r\nBut the very first time such talk was begun in my dormitory, I spoke\r\nout.  What I said I don\'t know, but I felt as if I was trampling on a\r\nslimy poisonous adder, and, at any rate, I showed such pain and distress\r\nthat the fellows dropped it at the time.  Since then I have absolutely\r\nrefused to stay in the room if ever such talk is begun.  So it never is\r\nnow, and I do think the fellows are very glad of it themselves."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Montagu, "I don\'t profess to look on it from the religious\r\nground, you know, but I thought it blackguardly, and in bad taste, and\r\nsaid so.  The fellow who began it threatened to kick me for a conceited\r\nlittle fool, but he didn\'t; and they hardly ever venture on that line\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"It is more than blackguardly, it is deadly," answered Russell; "my\r\nfather said it was the most fatal curse which could ever become rife in\r\na public school."\r\n\r\n"Why do masters never give us any help or advice on these matters?"\r\nasked Eric thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"In sermons they do.  Don\'t you remember Rowlands\'s sermon not two weeks\r\nago on Kibroth-Hattaavah?  But I for one think them quite right not to\r\nspeak to us privately on such subjects, unless we invite confidence.\r\nBesides, they cannot know that any boys talk in this way.  After all, it\r\nis only a very few of the worst who ever do."\r\n\r\nThey got up and walked home, but from day to day Eric put off performing\r\nthe duty which Russell had advised, viz.--a private request to Ball to\r\nabstain from his offensive communications, and an endeavour to enlist\r\nDuncan into his wishes.\r\n\r\nOne evening they were telling each other stories in Number 7.  Ball\'s\r\nturn came, and in his story the vile element again appeared.  For a\r\nwhile Eric said nothing, but as the strain grew worse, he made a faint\r\nremonstrance.\r\n\r\n"Shut up there, Williams," said Attlay, "and don\'t spoil the story."\r\n\r\n"Very well.  It\'s your own fault, and I shall shut my ears."\r\n\r\nHe did for a time, but a general laugh awoke him.  He pretended to be\r\nasleep, but he listened.  Iniquity of this kind was utterly new to him;\r\nhis curiosity was awakened; he no longer feigned indifference, and the\r\npoison of evil communication flowed deep into his veins.\r\n\r\nOh, young boys, if your eyes ever read these pages, pause and beware.\r\nThe knowledge of evil is ruin, and the continuance in it is moral death.\r\nThat little matter--that beginning of evil--it will be like the\r\nsnowflake detached by the breath of air from the mountain-top, which, as\r\nit rushes down, gains size and strength and impetus, till it has swollen\r\nto the mighty and irresistible avalanche that overwhelms garden and\r\nfield and village in a chaos of undistinguishable death.\r\n\r\nKibroth-Hattaavah!  Many and many a young Englishman has perished there!\r\nMany and many a happy English boy, the jewel of his mother\'s heart--\r\nbrave and beautiful and strong--lies buried there.  Very pale their\r\nshadows rise before us--the shadows of our young brothers who have\r\nsinned and suffered.  From the sea and the sod, from foreign graves and\r\nEnglish churchyards, they start up and throng around us in the paleness\r\nof their fall.  May every schoolboy who reads this page be warned by the\r\nwaving of their wasted hands, from that burning marle of passion where\r\nthey found nothing but shame and ruin, polluted affections, and an early\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nDORMITORY LIFE.\r\n\r\n  Aspasie trillistos epeluthe nux erebenne.--_Homer_.\r\n\r\nFor a few days after the Sunday walk narrated in the last chapter Upton\r\nand Eric cut each other dead.  Upton was angry at Eric\'s declining the\r\nhonour of his company, and Eric was piqued at Upton\'s unreasonableness.\r\nIn the "taking up" system, such quarrels were of frequent occurrence,\r\nand as the existence of a misunderstanding was generally indicated in\r\nthis very public way, the variations of good-will between such friends\r\ngenerally excited no little notice and amusement among the other boys.\r\nBut both Upton and Eric were too sensible to carry their differences so\r\nfar as others similarly circumstanced; each thoroughly enjoyed the\r\nother\'s company, and they generally seized an early opportunity for\r\neffecting a reconciliation, which united them more firmly than ever.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Eric had got over his little pique, he made the first\r\nadvances by writing a note to Upton, which he slipped under his study\r\ndoor, and which ran as follows--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Horace,--Don\'t let us quarrel about nothing.  Silly fellow, why\r\n  should you be angry with me because for once I wanted to go a walk\r\n  with Russell, who, by the bye, is twice as good a fellow as you?  I\r\n  shall expect you to make it up directly after prayers.--Yours, if you\r\n  are not silly, EW."\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, that as they came out from prayers Upton seized\r\nEric\'s hand, and slapped him on the back, after which they had a good\r\nlaugh over their own foolish fracas, and ran upstairs, chattering\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\n"There\'s to be an awful lark in the dormitories to-night," said Eric;\r\n"the Doctor\'s gone to a dinner-party, and we\'re going to have no end of\r\nfun."\r\n\r\n"Are you?  Well, if it gets amusing, come to my study and tell me, and\r\nI\'ll come and look on."\r\n\r\n"Very well; depend upon it I\'ll come."  And they parted at the foot of\r\nthe study stairs.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr Rose\'s night of duty.  He walked slowly up and down the range\r\nof dormitories until every boy seemed ready to get into bed, and then he\r\nput out all the candles.  So long as he was present the boys observed\r\nthe utmost quiet and decorum.  All continued quite orderly until he had\r\npassed away through the lavatory, and one of the boys, following him as\r\na scout, had seen the last glimmer of his candle disappear round the\r\ncorner at the foot of the great staircase, and heard the library door\r\nclose behind him.\r\n\r\nAfter that, particularly as Dr Rowlands was absent, the boys knew that\r\nthey were safe from disturbance, and the occupants of Number 7 were the\r\nfirst to stir.\r\n\r\n"Now for some fun," said Duncan, starting up, and, by way of initiative,\r\npitching his pillow at Eric\'s head.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll pay you out for that when I\'m ready," said Eric, laughing; "but\r\ngive us a match first."\r\n\r\nDuncan produced some vestas, and no sooner had they lighted their\r\ncandle, than several of the dormitory doors began to be thrown open, and\r\none after another all requested a light, which Duncan and Eric conveyed\r\nto them in a sort of emulous torch-race, so that at length all the\r\ntwelve dormitories had their sconces lit, and the boys began all sorts\r\nof amusement, some in their night-shirts, and others with their trousers\r\nslipped on.  Leap-frog was the prevalent game for a time, but at last\r\nGraham suggested theatricals, and they were agreed on.\r\n\r\n"But we\'re making a regular knock-me-down shindy," said Llewellyn;\r\n"somebody must keep cave."\r\n\r\n"Oh, old Rose is safe enough at his Hebrew in the library; no fear of\r\ndisturbing him if we were dancing hippopotami," answered Graham.\r\n\r\nBut it was generally considered safe to put some one at the top of the\r\nstairs, in case of an unexpected diversion in that direction, and little\r\nWright consented to go first.  He had only to leave the lavatory door\r\nopen, and stand at the top of the staircase, and he then commanded for a\r\ngreat distance the only avenue, in which danger was expected.  If any\r\nmaster\'s candle appeared in the hall, the boys had full three minutes\'\r\nwarning, and a single loudly-whispered "cave" would cause some one in\r\neach dormitory instantly to "dowse the glim," and shut the door; so that\r\nby the time of the adversary\'s arrival they would all be (of course)\r\nfast asleep in bed, some of them snoring in an alarming manner.\r\nWhatever noise the master might have heard, it would be impossible to\r\nfix it on any of the sleepers.\r\n\r\nSo at the top of the stairs stood little Wright, shoeless, and shivering\r\nin his night-gown, but keenly entering into the fun, and not unconscious\r\nof the dignity of his position.  Meanwhile the rest were getting up a\r\nscenic representation of Bombastes Furioso, arranging a stage, piling a\r\nlot of beds together for a theatre, and dressing up the actors in the\r\nmost fantastic apparel.\r\n\r\nThe impromptu Bombastes excited universal applause, and just at the end\r\nWright ran in through the lavatory.\r\n\r\n"I say," said the little fellow, "it\'s jolly cold standing at the top of\r\nthe stairs.  Won\'t some one relieve guard?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I will," answered Eric good-naturedly; "it\'s a shame that one\r\nfellow should have all the bother and none of the fun," and he ran to\r\ntake Wright\'s post.\r\n\r\nAfter watching a minute or two, he felt sure that there was no danger,\r\nand therefore ran up to Upton\'s study for a change.\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s up?" said the study-boy approvingly, as he glanced at\r\nEric\'s laughing eyes.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ve been having leap-frog, and then Bombastes Furioso.  But I\'m\r\nkeeping `cave\' now; only it\'s so cold that I thought I\'d run up to your\r\nstudy."\r\n\r\n"Little traitor; we\'ll shoot you for a deserting sentinel."\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" said Eric, "it\'s all serene; Rowley\'s out, and dear old Rose\'d\r\nnever dream of supposing us elsewhere than in the arms of Morpheus.\r\nBesides, the fellows are making less row now."\r\n\r\n"Well, look here! let\'s go and look on, and I\'ll tell you a dodge; put\r\none of the tin washing-basins against the iron door of the lavatory, and\r\nthen if any one comes he\'ll make clang enough to wake the dead; and\r\nwhile he\'s amusing himself with this, there\'ll be lots of time to\r\n`extinguish the superfluous abundance of the nocturnal illuminators.\'\r\nEh?"\r\n\r\n"Capital!" said Eric; "come along."\r\n\r\nThey went down and arranged the signal very artistically, leaving the\r\niron door ajar a little, and then neatly poising the large tin-basin on\r\nits edge, so as to lean against it.  Having extremely enjoyed this part\r\nof the proceedings, they went to look at the theatricals again, the boys\r\nbeing highly delighted at Upton\'s appearance among them.\r\n\r\nThey at once made Eric take a part in some very distant reminiscences of\r\nMacbeth, and corked his cheeks with whiskers and mustachios to make him\r\nresemble Banquo, his costume being completed by a girdle round his\r\nnight-shirt, consisting of a very fine crimson silk handkerchief, richly\r\nbroidered with gold, which had been brought to him from India, and which\r\nat first, in the innocence of his heart, he used to wear on Sundays,\r\nuntil it acquired the soubriquet of "the Dragon."  Duncan made a superb\r\nMacbeth.\r\n\r\nThey were doing the dagger-scene, which was put on the stage in a most\r\nnovel manner.  A sheet had been pinned from the top of the room, on one\r\nside of which stood a boy with a broken dinner-knife, the handle end of\r\nwhich he was pushing through a hole in the middle of the sheet at the\r\nshadow of Duncan on the other side.\r\n\r\nDuncan himself in an attitude of intensely-affected melodrama, was\r\nspouting--\r\n\r\n  "Is this a dagger which I see before me?\r\n  The handle towards me now? come, let me clutch thee."\r\n\r\nAnd he snatched convulsively at the handle of the protruded knife; but\r\nas soon as he nearly touched it, this end was immediately withdrawn and\r\nthe blade end substituted, which made the comic Macbeth instantly draw\r\nback again, and recommence his apostrophe.  This scene had tickled the\r\naudience immensely, and Duncan, amid shouts of laughter, was just\r\ndrawing the somewhat unwarrantable conclusion that it was:\r\n\r\n  "A dagger of the mind, a false creation."\r\n\r\nwhen a sudden grating, followed by a reverberated clang, produced a dead\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Cave," shouted Eric, and took a flying leap into his bed.  Instantly\r\nthere was a bolt in different directions; the sheet was torn down, the\r\ncandles dashed out, the beds shoved aside, and the dormitories at once\r\nplunged in profound silence, only broken by the heavy breathing of\r\nsleepers, when in strode--not Mr Rose or any of the under-masters--but\r\nDr Rowlands himself!\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment to survey the scene.  All the dormitory doors were\r\nwide open; the sheet which had formed the stage curtain lay torn on the\r\nfloor of Number 7; the beds in all the adjoining rooms were in the\r\nstrangest positions; and half-extinguished wicks still smouldered in\r\nseveral of the sconces.  Every boy was in bed, but the extraordinary way\r\nin which the bed-clothes were huddled about told an unmistakable tale.\r\n\r\nHe glanced quickly round, but the moment he had passed into Number 8 he\r\nheard a run, and, turning, just caught sight of Upton\'s figure vanishing\r\ninto the darkness of the lavatory, towards the study stairs.\r\n\r\nHe said not a word, but stalked hastily through all the dormitories,\r\nagain stopping at Number 7 on his return.  He heard nothing but the deep\r\nsnores of Duncan, and instantly fixed on him as a chief culprit.\r\n\r\n"Duncan!"\r\n\r\nNo reply; but calm stertorous music from Duncan\'s bed.\r\n\r\n"Duncan!" he said, still louder and more sternly; "you sleep soundly,\r\nsir, too soundly; get up directly," and he laid his hand on the boy\'s\r\narm.\r\n\r\n"Get away, you old donkey," said Duncan sleepily, "\'taint time to get up\r\nyet.  First bell hasn\'t rung."\r\n\r\n"Come, sir, this shamming will only increase your punishment," but the\r\nimperturbable Duncan stretched himself lazily, gave a great yawn, and\r\nthen awoke with such an admirably-feigned start at seeing Dr Rowlands,\r\nthat Eric, who had been peeping at the scene from over his bed-clothes,\r\nburst into an irresistible explosion of laughter.\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands swung round on his heel--\r\n\r\n"What!  Williams! get out of bed, sir, this instant."\r\n\r\nEric, forgetful of his disguise, sheepishly obeyed, but when he stood on\r\nthe floor, he looked so odd in his crimson girdle and corked cheeks,\r\nwith Dr Rowlands surveying him in intense astonishment, that the scene\r\nbecame overpoweringly ludicrous to Duncan, who now in his turn was\r\nconvulsed with a storm of laughter, faintly echoed in stifled titterings\r\nfrom other beds.\r\n\r\n"_Very_ good," said Dr Rowlands, now thoroughly angry; "you will hear\r\nof this to-morrow," and he walked away with a heavy step, stopping at\r\nthe lavatory door to restore the tin-basin to its proper place, and then\r\nmounting to the studies.\r\n\r\nStanding in the passage into which the studies opened, he knocked at one\r\nof the doors, and told a boy to summon all their occupants at once to\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the dormitory boys were aghast, and as soon as they heard the\r\nDoctor\'s retreating footsteps, began flocking in the dark to Number 7,\r\nnot daring to relight their candles.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious!" said Attlay, "only to think of Rowley appearing!  How\r\ncould he have twigged?"\r\n\r\n"He must have seen our lights in the window as he came home," said Eric.\r\n\r\n"I say, what a row that tin-basin dodge of yours made!  What a rage the\r\nDoctor will be in to-morrow!"\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you just catch it!" said Barker to Duncan, but intending the\r\nremark for Eric.\r\n\r\n"Just like your mean chaff," retorted Duncan.  "But I say, Williams," he\r\ncontinued, laughing, "you _did_ look so funny in the whiskers."\r\n\r\nAt this juncture they heard all the study-boys running downstairs to the\r\nlibrary, and, lost in conjecture, retired to their different rooms.\r\n\r\n"What do you think he\'ll do to us?" asked Eric.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," said Duncan uneasily; "flog us for one thing, that\'s\r\ncertain.  I\'m so sorry about that basin, Eric; but it\'s no good\r\nfretting.  We\'ve had our cake, and now we must pay for it, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nEric\'s cogitations began to be unpleasant, when the door opened, and\r\nsomebody stole noiselessly in.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?"\r\n\r\n"Upton.  I\'ve come to have a chat.  The Doctor\'s like a turkey-cock at\r\nthe sight of a red handkerchief.  Never saw him in such a rage."\r\n\r\n"Why, what\'s he been saying?" asked Eric, as Upton came and took a seat\r\non his bed.\r\n\r\n"Oh! he\'s been rowing us like six o\'clock," said Upton, "about `moral\r\nresponsibility,\' `abetting the follies of children,\' `forgetting our\r\nposition in the school,\' and I don\'t know what all; and he ended by\r\nasking who\'d been in the dormitories.  Of course, I confessed the soft\r\nimpeachment, whereon he snorted, `Ha!  I suspected so.  Very well, sir,\r\nyou don\'t know how to use a study; you shall be deprived of it till the\r\nend of term.\'"\r\n\r\n"Did he really, Horace?" said Eric.  "And it\'s all my doing that you\'ve\r\ngot into the scrape.  Do forgive me."\r\n\r\n"Bosh!  My dear fellow," said Upton, "it\'s twice as much my fault as\r\nyours; and, after all, it was only a bit of fun.  It\'s rather a bore\r\nlosing the study, certainly; but never mind, we shall see all the more\r\nof each other.  Good-night; I must be off."\r\n\r\nNext morning, prayers were no sooner over than Dr Rowlands said to the\r\nboys, "Stop!  I have a word to say to you."\r\n\r\n"I find that there was the utmost disorder in the dormitories yesterday\r\nevening.  All the candles were relighted at forbidden hours, and the\r\nnoise made was so great that it was heard through the whole building.  I\r\nam grieved that I cannot leave you, even for a few hours, without your\r\ntaking such advantage of my absence; and that the upper boys, so far\r\nfrom using their influence to prevent these infractions of discipline,\r\nseem inclined rather to join in them themselves.  On this occasion I\r\nhave punished Upton, by depriving him of a privilege which he has\r\nabused; and as I myself detected Duncan and Williams, they will be\r\nflogged in the library at twelve.  But I now come to the worst part of\r\nthe proceeding.  Somebody had been reckless enough to try and prevent\r\nsurprise by the dangerous expedient of putting a tin-basin against the\r\niron door.  The consequence was, that I was severely hurt, and _might_\r\nhave been seriously injured in entering the lavatory.  I must know the\r\nname of the delinquent."\r\n\r\nUpton and Eric immediately stood up.  Dr Rowlands looked surprised, and\r\nthere was an expression of grieved interest in Mr Rose\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the Doctor, "I shall speak to you both privately."\r\n\r\nTwelve o\'clock came, and Duncan and Eric received a severe caning.\r\nCorporal punishment, however necessary and desirable for some\r\ndispositions, always produced on Eric the worst effects.  He burned not\r\nwith remorse or regret, but with shame and violent indignation, and\r\nlistened, with an affectation of stubborn indifference, to Dr\r\nRowlands\'s warnings.  When the flogging was over, he almost rushed out\r\nof the room, to choke in solitude his sense of humiliation, nor would he\r\nsuffer any one for an instant to allude to his disgrace.  Dr Rowlands\r\nhad hinted that Upton was doing him no good; but he passionately\r\nresented the suggestion, and determined, with obstinate perversity, to\r\ncling more than ever to the boy whom he had helped to involve in the\r\nsame trouble with himself.\r\n\r\nAny attempt on the part of masters to interfere in the friendships of\r\nboys is usually unsuccessful.  The boy who has been warned against his\r\nnew acquaintance not seldom repeats to him the fact that Mr So-and-so\r\ndoesn\'t like seeing them together, and after that they fancy themselves\r\nbound in honour to show that they are not afraid of continuing their\r\nacquaintance.  It was not strange, therefore, that Eric and Upton were\r\nthrown more than ever into each other\'s society, and consequently that\r\nEric, while he improved daily in strength, activity, and prowess,\r\nneglected more and more his school duties and honourable ambitions.\r\n\r\nMr Rose sadly remarked the failure of promise in his character and\r\nabilities, and did all that could be done, by gentle firmness and\r\nunwavering kindness, to recall his pupil to a sense of duty.  One night\r\nhe sent for him to supper, and invited no one else.  During the evening\r\nhe drew out Eric\'s exercise, and compared it with those of Russell and\r\nOwen, who were now getting easily ahead of him in marks.  Eric\'s was\r\ncareless, hurried, and untidy; the other two were neat, spirited, and\r\npainstaking, and had, therefore, been marked much higher.  They\r\ndisplayed all the difference between conscientious and perfunctory work.\r\n\r\n"Your exercises _used_ to be far better--even incomparably better," said\r\nMr Rose; "what is the cause of this falling off?"\r\n\r\nEric was silent.\r\n\r\nMr Rose laid his hand gently on his head.  "I fear, my boy, you have\r\nnot been improving lately.  You have got into many scrapes, and are\r\nletting boys beat you in form who are far your inferiors in ability.\r\nThat is a very bad _sign_, Eric; in itself it is a discouraging fact,\r\nbut I fear it indicates worse evils.  You are wasting the golden hours,\r\nmy boy, that can never return.  I only hope and trust that no other\r\nchange for the worse is taking place in your character."\r\n\r\nAnd so he talked on till the boy\'s sorrow was undisguised.  "Come," he\r\nsaid gently, "let us kneel down together before we part."\r\n\r\nBoy and master knelt down humbly side by side, and, from a full heart,\r\nthe young man poured out his fervent petitions for the boy beside him.\r\nEric\'s soul seemed to catch a glow from his words, and he loved him as a\r\nbrother.  He rose from his knees full of the strongest resolutions, and\r\nearnestly promised amendment for the future.\r\n\r\nBut poor Eric did not yet know his own infirmity.  For a time, indeed,\r\nthere was a marked improvement; but daily life flowed on with its usual\r\nallurements, and when the hours of temptation came, his good intentions\r\nmelted away like the morning dew, so that, in a few more weeks, the\r\nprayer, and the vows that followed it, had been obliterated from his\r\nmemory without leaving any traces in his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nERIC IN COVENTRY.\r\n\r\n  And either greet him not,\r\n  Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more\r\n  Than if not looked on.\r\n  _Troilus and Cressida_, Act Three, Scene 3.\r\n\r\nUpton, expatriated from his study, was allowed to use one of the smaller\r\nclassrooms which were occupied during play-hours by those boys who were\r\ntoo high in the school for "the boarders\' room," and who were waiting to\r\nsucceed to the studies as they fell vacant.  There were three or four\r\nothers with him in this classroom, and although it was less pleasant\r\nthan his old quarters, it was yet far more comfortable than the\r\nPandemonium of the Shell and fourth-form boys.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, no boys were allowed to sit in any of the classrooms\r\nexcept their legitimate occupants.  The rule, however, was very\r\ngenerally overlooked, and hence Eric, always glad of an opportunity to\r\nescape from the company of Barker and his associates, became a constant\r\nfrequenter of his friend\'s new abode.  Here they used to make themselves\r\nvery comfortable.  Joining the rest, they would drink coffee or\r\nchocolate, and amuse themselves over the fire with _Punch_, or some\r\nwarlike novel in a green or yellow cover.  One of them very often read\r\naloud to the rest; and Eric, being both a good reader and a merry\r\nintelligent listener, soon became quite a favourite among the other\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nMr Rose had often seen him sitting there, and left him unmolested; but\r\nif ever Mr Gordon happened to come in and notice him, he invariably\r\nturned him out, and after the first offence or two, had several times\r\nset him an imposition.  This treatment gave fresh intensity to his now\r\ndeeply-seated disgust at his late master, and his expressions of\r\nindignation at "Gordon\'s spite" were loud and frequent.\r\n\r\nOne day Mr Gordon had accidentally come in, and found no one there but\r\nUpton and Eric; they were standing very harmlessly by the window, with\r\nUpton\'s arm resting kindly on Eric\'s shoulder, as they watched with\r\nadmiration the network of rippled sunbeams that flashed over the sea.\r\nUpton had just been telling Eric the splendid phrase, "anerhithmon\r\ngelasma ponton", which he had stumbled upon in an Aeschylus lesson that\r\nmorning, and they were trying which would hit on the best rendering of\r\nit.  Eric stuck up for the literal sublimity of "the innumerable\r\nlaughter of the sea," while Upton was trying to win him over to "the\r\nmany-twinkling smile of ocean."  They were enjoying the discussion, and\r\neach stoutly maintaining his own rendering, when Mr Gordon entered.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion he was particularly angry: he had an especial dislike\r\nof seeing the two boys together, because he fancied that the younger had\r\ngrown more than usually conceited and neglectful since he had been under\r\nthe fifth-form patronage; and he saw in Eric\'s presence there a new case\r\nof wilful disobedience.\r\n\r\n"Williams, here _again_!" he exclaimed sharply; "why, sir, you seem to\r\nsuppose that you may defy rules with impunity!  How often have I told\r\nyou that no one is allowed to sit here, except the regular occupants?"\r\n\r\nHis voice startled the two boys from their pleasant discussion.\r\n\r\n"No other master takes any notice of it, sir," said Upton.\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to do with other masters.  Williams, you will bring me\r\nthe fourth Georgic, written out by Saturday morning, for your repeated\r\ndisobedience.  Upton, I have a great mind to punish you also, for\r\ntempting him to come here."\r\n\r\nThis was a mistake on Mr Gordon\'s part, of which Upton took immediate\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n"I have no power to prevent it, sir, if he wishes it.  Besides," he\r\ncontinued with annoying blandness of tone, "it would be inhospitable;\r\nand I am too glad of his company."\r\n\r\nEric smiled; and Mr Gordon frowned.  "Williams, leave the room\r\ninstantly."\r\n\r\nThe boy obeyed slowly and doggedly.  "Mr Rose never interferes with me,\r\nwhen he sees me here," he said as he retreated.\r\n\r\n"Then I shall request Mr Rose to do so in future; your conceit and\r\nimpertinence are getting intolerable."\r\n\r\nEric only answered with a fiery glance; for of all charges the one which\r\na boy resents most is an accusation of conceit.  The next minute Upton\r\njoined him on the stairs, and Mr Gordon heard them laughing a little\r\nostentatiously, as they ran out into the playground together.  He went\r\naway full of strong contempt, and from that moment began to look on the\r\nfriends as two of the worst boys in the school.\r\n\r\nThis incident had happened on Thursday, which was a half-holiday, and\r\ninstead of being able to join in any of the games, Eric had to spend\r\nthat weary afternoon in writing away at the fourth Georgic; Upton\r\nstaying in a part of the time to help him a little, by dictating the\r\nlines to him--an occupation not unfrequently interrupted by storms of\r\nfurious denunciation against Mr Gordon\'s injustice and tyranny; Eric\r\nvowing, with the usual vagueness of schoolboy intention, "that he would\r\npay him out somehow yet."\r\n\r\nThe imposition was not finished that evening, and it again consumed some\r\nof the next day\'s leisure, part of it being written between schools in\r\nthe forbidden classroom.  Still it was not quite finished on Friday\r\nafternoon at six, when school ended, and Eric stayed a few minutes\r\nbehind the rest to scribble off the last ten lines; which done, he\r\nbanged down the lid of the desk, not locking it, and ran out.\r\n\r\nThe next morning an incident happened which involved considerable\r\nconsequences to some of the actors in my story.\r\n\r\nMr Rose and several other masters had not a schoolroom to themselves,\r\nlike Mr Gordon, but heard their forms in the great hall.  At one end of\r\nthis hall was a board used for the various school notices, to which\r\nthere were always affixed two or three pieces of paper containing\r\nannouncements about examinations and other matters of general interest.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning (when Eric was to give up his Georgic), the boys, as\r\nthey dropped into the hall for morning school, observed a new notice on\r\nthe board, and thronging round to see what it was, read these words,\r\nwritten on a half-sheet of paper attached by wafers to the board--\r\n\r\n"GORDON IS A SURLY DEVIL."\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, so completely novel an announcement took them all\r\nvery much by surprise, and they wondered who had been so audacious as to\r\nplay this trick.  But their wonder was cut short by the entrance of the\r\nmasters, and they all took their seats, without any one tearing down the\r\ndangerous paper.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the eye of the second master, Mr Ready, fell on the\r\npaper, and, going up, he read it, stood for a moment transfixed with\r\nastonishment, and then called Mr Rose.\r\n\r\nPointing to the inscription he said, "I think we had better leave that\r\nthere, Rose, exactly as it is, till Dr Rowlands has seen it.  Would you\r\nmind asking him to step in here?"\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture Eric came in, having been delayed by Mr Gordon,\r\nwhile he rigidly inspected the imposition.  As he took his seat,\r\nMontagu, who was next him, whispered--\r\n\r\n"I say, have you seen the notice-board?"\r\n\r\n"No.  Why?"\r\n\r\n"Why, some fellow has been writing up an opinion of Gordon not very\r\nfavourable."\r\n\r\n"And serve him right, too, brute!" said Eric, smarting with the memory\r\nof his imposition.\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'ll be no end of a row; you\'ll see."\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, Dr Rowlands came in with Mr Rose.  He read\r\nthe paper, frowned, pondered a moment, and then said to Mr Rose--\r\n\r\n"Would you kindly summon the lower-school into the hall?  As it would be\r\npainful to Mr Gordon to be present, you had better explain to him how\r\nmatters stand."\r\n\r\n"Hulloa! here\'s a rumpus!" whispered Montagu; "he never has the\r\nlower-school down for nothing."\r\n\r\nA noise was heard on the stairs, and in flocked the lower-school.  When\r\nthey had ranged themselves on the vacant forms, there was a dead silence\r\nand hush of expectation.\r\n\r\n"I have summoned you all together," said the Doctor, "on a most serious\r\noccasion.  This morning, on coming into the schoolroom, the masters\r\nfound that the notice-board had been abused for the purpose of writing\r\nup an insult to one of our number, which is at once coarse and wicked.\r\nAs only a few of you have seen it, it becomes my deeply painful duty to\r\ninform you of its purport; the words are these--`Gordon is a surly\r\ndevil.\'"  A _very_ slight titter followed this statement, which was\r\ninstantly succeeded by a sort of thrilling excitement; but Eric, when he\r\nheard the words, started perceptibly, and coloured as he caught\r\nMontagu\'s eye fixed on him.\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands continued--\r\n\r\n"I suppose this dastardly impertinence has been perpetrated by some boy\r\nout of a spirit of revenge.  I am perfectly amazed at the audacity and\r\nmeanness of the attempt, and it may be very difficult to discover the\r\nauthor of it.  But, depend upon it, discover him _we will_ at whatever\r\ncost.  Whoever the offender may be, and he must be listening to me at\r\nthis moment, let him be assured that he shall _not_ be unpunished.  His\r\nguilty secret shall be torn from him.  His punishment can only be\r\nmitigated by his instantly yielding himself up."\r\n\r\nNo one stirred, but during the latter part of this address Eric was so\r\nuneasy, and his cheek burned with such hot crimson, that several eyes\r\nwere upon him, and the suspicions of more than one boy were awakened.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said the head-master, "the guilty boy is not inclined to\r\nconfess.  Mark, then; if his name has not been given up to me by to-day\r\nweek, every indulgence to the school will be forfeited, the next whole\r\nholiday stopped, and the coming cricket-match prohibited."\r\n\r\n"The handwriting may be some clue," suggested Mr Ready.  "Would you\r\nhave any objection to my examining the note-books of the Shell?"\r\n\r\n"None at all.  The Shell boys are to show their books to Mr Ready\r\nimmediately."\r\n\r\nThe head-boy of the Shell collected the books, and took them to the\r\ndesk; the three masters glanced casually at about a dozen, and suddenly\r\nstopped at one.  Eric\'s heart beat loud, as he saw Mr Rose point\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n"We have discovered a handwriting which remarkably resembles that on the\r\nboard.  I give the offender one more chance of substituting confession\r\nfor detection."\r\n\r\nNo one stirred; but Montagu felt that his friend was trembling\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\n"Eric Williams, stand out in the room!"\r\n\r\nBlushing scarlet, and deeply agitated, the boy obeyed.\r\n\r\n"The writing on the notice is exactly like yours.  Do you know anything\r\nof this shameful proceeding?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir," he murmured in a low tone.\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing whatever, sir."\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands\'s look searched him through and through, and seemed to burn\r\ninto his heart.  He did not meet it, but hung his head.  The Doctor felt\r\ncertain from his manner that he was guilty.  He chained him to the spot\r\nwith his glance for a minute or two, and then said slowly, and with a\r\ndeep sigh--\r\n\r\n"Very well; I _hope_ you have spoken the truth, but whether you have or\r\nno, we shall soon discover.  The school, and especially the upper boys,\r\nwill remember what I have said.  I shall now tear down the insulting\r\nnotice, and put it into your hands, Avonley, as head of the school, that\r\nyou may make further inquiries."  He left the room, and the boys resumed\r\ntheir usual avocation till twelve o\'clock.  But poor Eric could hardly\r\nget through his ordinary pursuits; he felt sick and giddy, until\r\neverybody noticed his strange embarrassed manner and random answers.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had twelve o\'clock struck than the whole school broke up into\r\nknots of buzzing and eager talkers.\r\n\r\n"I wonder who did it," said a dozen voices at once.  "The writing was\r\nundoubtedly Williams\'s," suggested some.\r\n\r\n"And did you notice how red and pale he got when the Doctor spoke to\r\nhim, and how he hung his head?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and one knows how he hates Gordon."\r\n\r\n"Ay; by the bye, Gordon set him a Georgic only on Thursday, and he has\r\nbeen swearing at him ever since."\r\n\r\n"I noticed that he stayed in after all the rest last night," said Barker\r\npointedly.\r\n\r\n"Did he?  By Jove, that looks bad."\r\n\r\n"Has any one charged him with it?" asked Duncan.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered one of the group; "but he\'s as proud about it as\r\nLucifer, and is furious if you mention it to him.  He says we ought to\r\nknow him better than to think him capable of such a thing."\r\n\r\n"And quite right, too," said Duncan.  "If he did it, he\'s done something\r\ntotally unlike what one would have believed possible of him."\r\n\r\nThe various items of evidence were put together, and certainly they\r\nseemed to prove a strong case against Eric.  In addition to the\r\nprobabilities already mentioned, it was found that the ink used was of a\r\nviolet colour, and a peculiar kind, which Eric was known to patronise;\r\nand not only so, but the wafers with which the paper had been attached\r\nto the board were yellow, and exactly of the same size with some which\r\nEric was said to possess.  How the latter facts had been discovered,\r\nnobody exactly knew, but they began to be very generally whispered\r\nthroughout the school.\r\n\r\nIn short, the almost universal conviction among the boys proclaimed that\r\nhe was guilty, and many urged him to confess it at once, and save the\r\nschool from the threatened punishment.  But he listened to such\r\nsuggestions with the most passionate indignation.\r\n\r\n"What!" he said angrily, "tell a wilful lie to blacken my own innocent\r\ncharacter?  Never!"\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, they all begun to shun him.  Eric was put into\r\nCoventry.  Very few boys in the school still clung to him, and\r\nmaintained his innocence in spite of appearances, but they were the boys\r\nwhom he had most loved and valued, and they were most vigorous in his\r\ndefence.  They were Russell, Montagu, Duncan, Owen, and little Wright.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the Saturday, Upton had sought out Eric, and said, in\r\na very serious tone, "This is a bad business, Williams.  I cannot forget\r\nhow you have been abusing Gordon lately, and though I won\'t believe you\r\nguilty, yet you ought to explain."\r\n\r\n"What? even _you_, then, suspect me?" said Eric, bursting into proud and\r\nangry tears.  "Very well.  I shan\'t condescend to _deny_ it.  I won\'t\r\nspeak to you again till you have repented of mistrusting me," and he\r\nresolutely rejected all further overtures on Upton\'s part.\r\n\r\nHe was alone in his misery.  Some one, he perceived, had plotted to\r\ndestroy his character, and he saw too clearly how many causes of\r\nsuspicion told against him.  But it was very bitter to think that the\r\nwhole school could so readily suppose that he would do a thing which\r\nfrom his soul he abhorred.  "No," he thought; "bad I may be, but I\r\n_could_ not have done such a base and cowardly trick."\r\n\r\nNever in his life had he been so wretched.  He wandered alone to the\r\nrocks, and watched the waves dashing against them with the rising tide.\r\nThe tumult of the weather seemed to relieve and console the tumult of\r\nhis heart.  He drank in strength and defiance from the roar of the\r\nwaters, and climbed to their very edge along the rocks, where every\r\nfresh rush of the waves enveloped him in white swirls of cold salt\r\nspray.  The look of the green, rough, hungry sea harmonised with his\r\nfeelings, and he sat down and stared into it, to find relief from the\r\ntorment of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nAt last, with a deep sigh, he turned away to go back and meet the crowd\r\nof suspicious and unkindly companions, and brood alone over his sorrow\r\nin the midst of them.  He had not gone many steps when he caught sight\r\nof Russell in the distance.  His first impulse was to run away and\r\nescape; but Russell determined to stop him, and when he came up, said,\r\n"Dear Eric, I have sought you out on purpose to tell you that I don\'t\r\nsuspect you, and have never done so for a moment.  I know you too well,\r\nmy boy, and be sure that _I_ will always stick to you, even if the whole\r\nschool cut you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Edwin, I am _so_ wretched.  I needn\'t tell you that I am quite\r\ninnocent of this.  What have I done to be so suspected?  Why, even your\r\ncousin Upton won\'t believe me."\r\n\r\n"But he does, Eric," said Russell; "he told me so just now, and several\r\nothers said the same thing."\r\n\r\nA transient gleam passed over Eric\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I do so long for home again," he said.  "I hate this place.  Except\r\nyou, I have no friend."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say so, Eric.  This cloud will soon blow over.  Depend upon it,\r\nas the Doctor said, we shall discover the offender yet, and the fellows\r\nwill soon make you reparation for their false suspicions.  And you\r\n_have_ one friend, Eric," he continued, pointing reverently upwards.\r\n\r\nEric was overcome; he sat down on the grass, while intense pride and the\r\nconsciousness of innocence struggled with the burning sense of painful\r\ninjustice.  Russell sat silent and pitying beside him, till at last\r\nEric, with sudden energy, sprang to his feet, and said, "Now, Edwin!\r\nI\'ve been conquering my cowardice, thanks to you, so come along home.\r\nAfter all, the fellows are in the wrong, not I," and so saying he took\r\nRussell\'s arm, and walked across the playground with almost a haughty\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, Eric found three notes in his drawer.  One was from\r\nMr Gordon, and ran thus--\r\n\r\n  "I have little doubt, Williams, that you have done this act.  Believe\r\n  me, I feel no anger, only pity for you.  Come to me and confess, and I\r\n  promise, by every means in my power, to befriend and save you."\r\n\r\nThis note he read, and then, stamping on the floor, tore it up furiously\r\ninto twenty pieces, which he scattered about the room.\r\n\r\nAnother was from Mr Rose--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Eric--I _cannot, will_ not, believe you guilty, although\r\n  appearances look very black.  You have many faults, but I feel sure\r\n  that I cannot be mistaken in supposing you too noble-minded for a\r\n  revenge so petty and so mean.  Come to me, my boy, if I can help you\r\n  in any way.  I _trust you_, Eric, and will use every endeavour to\r\n  right you in the general estimation.  You are innocent; pray to God\r\n  for help under this cruel trial, and be sure that your character will\r\n  yet be cleared.--Affectionately yours, Walter Rose."\r\n\r\n  "P.S.--I can easily understand that just now you will like quiet; come\r\n  and sit with me in the library as much as you like."\r\n\r\nHe read this note two or three times with grateful emotion, and at that\r\nmoment would have died for Mr Rose.  The third note was from Owen, as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n  "Dear Williams--We have been cool to each other lately; naturally,\r\n  perhaps.  But yet I think that it will be some consolation to you to\r\n  be told, even by a rival, that I, for one, feel certain of your\r\n  innocence,--and, moreover, think that I can _prove_ it, as I will tell\r\n  you in time.  If you want company, I shall be delighted to have a\r\n  walk.--Yours truly, D.  Owen."\r\n\r\nThis note, too, brought much comfort to the poor boy\'s lonely and\r\npassionate heart.  He put it into his pocket, and determined at once to\r\naccept Mr Rose\'s kind offer of allowing him to sit for the present in\r\nthe library.\r\n\r\nThere were several boys in the room while he was reading his notes, but\r\nnone of them spoke to him, and he was too proud to notice them, or\r\ninterrupt the constrained silence.  As he went out he met Duncan and\r\nMontagu, who at once addressed him in the hearing of the rest.\r\n\r\n"Ha!  Williams," said Duncan, "we have been looking everywhere for you,\r\nold fellow.  Cheer up, you shall be cleared yet.  I for one, and Monty\r\nfor another, will maintain your innocence before the whole school."\r\n\r\nMontagu _said_ nothing, but Eric understood full well the trustful\r\nkindness of his pressure of the hand.  His heart was too full to speak,\r\nand he went on towards the library.\r\n\r\n"I wonder at your speaking to that fellow," said Ball, as the two\r\nnewcomers joined the group at the fireplace.\r\n\r\n"You will be yourself ashamed of having ever suspected him before long,"\r\nsaid Montagu warmly; "ay, the whole lot of you; and you are very unkind\r\nto condemn him before you are certain."\r\n\r\n"I wish you joy of your _friend_, Duncan," sneered Barker.\r\n\r\n"Friend?" said Duncan, firing up; "yes! he is my friend, and I\'m not\r\nashamed of him.  It would be well for the school if _all_ the fellows\r\nwere as honourable as Williams."\r\n\r\nBarker took the hint, and although he was too brazen to blush, thought\r\nit better to say no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL.\r\n\r\n  A plot, a plot, a plot, to ruin all.\r\n  _Tennyson, The Princess_.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday evening the head-boy reported to Dr Rowlands that the\r\nperpetrator of the offence had not been discovered, but that one boy was\r\nvery generally suspected, and on grounds that seemed plausible.  "I\r\nadmit," he added, "that from the little I know of him, he seems to me a\r\nvery unlikely sort of boy to do it."\r\n\r\n"I think," suggested the Doctor, "that the best way would be for you to\r\nhave a regular trial on the subject and hear the evidence.  Do you think\r\nthat you can be trusted to carry on the investigation publicly, with\r\ngood order and fairness?"\r\n\r\n"I think so, sir," said Avonley.\r\n\r\n"Very well.  Put up a notice, asking all the school to meet by\r\nthemselves in the boarders\' room to-morrow afternoon at three, and see\r\nwhat you can do among you."\r\n\r\nAvonley did as the Doctor suggested.  At first, when the boys assembled,\r\nthey seemed inclined to treat the matter as a joke, and were rather\r\ndisorderly; but Avonley briefly begged them, if they determined to have\r\na trial, to see that it was conducted sensibly; and by general consent\r\nhe was himself voted into the desk as president.  He then got up and\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"There must be no sham or nonsense about this affair.  Let all the boys\r\ntake their seats quietly down the room."\r\n\r\nThey did so, and Avonley asked, "Is Williams here?"\r\n\r\nLooking round, they discovered he was not.  Russell instantly went to\r\nthe library to fetch him, and told him what was going on.  He took\r\nEric\'s arm kindly as they entered, to show the whole school that he was\r\nnot ashamed of him, and Eric deeply felt the delicacy of his goodwill.\r\n\r\n"Are you willing to be tried, Williams," asked Avonley, "on the charge\r\nof having written the insulting paper about Mr Gordon?  Of course we\r\nknow very little how these kind of things ought to be conducted, but we\r\nwill see that everything done is open and above ground, and try to\r\nmanage it properly."\r\n\r\n"There is nothing I should like better," said Eric.\r\n\r\nHe had quite recovered his firm manly bearing.  A quiet conversation\r\nwith his dearly loved friend and master had reassured him in the\r\nconfidence of innocence, and though the colour on his cheeks had through\r\nexcitement sunk into two bright red spots, he looked wonderfully noble\r\nand winning as he stood before the boys in the centre of the room,\r\nmodest, and yet with the proud consciousness of innocence in his\r\nbearing.  His appearance caused a little reaction in his favour, and a\r\nmurmur of applause followed his answer.\r\n\r\n"Good," said Avonley; "who will prosecute on the part of the school?"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.  Nobody seemed to covet the office.\r\n\r\n"Very well; if no one is willing to prosecute, the charge drops."\r\n\r\n"I will do it," said Gibson, a Rowlandite, one of the study-boys at the\r\ntop of the fifth-form.  He was a clever fellow, and Eric liked the\r\nlittle he had seen of him.\r\n\r\n"Have you any objection, Williams, to the jury being composed of the\r\nsixth-form? or are there any names among them which you wish to\r\nchallenge?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Eric, glancing round indifferently.\r\n\r\n"Well, now, who will defend the accused?"\r\n\r\nAnother pause, and Upton got up.\r\n\r\n"No," said Eric at once.  "You were inclined to distrust me, Upton, and\r\nI will only be defended by somebody who never doubted my innocence."\r\n\r\nAnother pause followed, and then, blushing crimson, Russell got up.  "I\r\nam only a Shell boy," he said; "but if Eric doesn\'t mind trusting his\r\ncause to me, I will defend him since no other fifth-form fellow stirs."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Russell, I _wanted_ you to offer; I could wish no better\r\ndefender."\r\n\r\n"Will Owen, Duncan, and Montagu help me, if they can?" asked Russell.\r\n\r\n"Very willingly," they all three said, and went to take their seats by\r\nhim.  They conversed eagerly for a few minutes, seeming to make more\r\nthan one discovery during their discussion, and then declared themselves\r\nready.\r\n\r\n"All I have got to do," said Gibson rising, "is to bring before the\r\nschool the grounds for suspecting Williams, and all the evidence which\r\nmakes it probable that he is the offender.  Now, first of all, the thing\r\nmust have been done between Friday evening and Saturday morning; and\r\nsince the schoolroom door is generally locked soon after school, it was\r\nprobably done in the short interval between six and a quarter-past.  I\r\nshall now examine some witnesses."\r\n\r\nThe first boy called upon was Pietrie, who deposed that on Friday\r\nevening, when he left the room, having been detained a few minutes, the\r\nonly boy remaining in it was Williams.\r\n\r\nCarter, the school-servant, was then sent for, and deposed that he had\r\nmet Master Williams hastily running out of the room, when he went at a\r\nquarter-past six to lock the door.\r\n\r\nExamined by Gibson--\r\n\r\n"Was any boy in the room when you did lock the door?"\r\n\r\n"No one."\r\n\r\n"Did you meet any one else in the passage?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nCross-examined by Russell--\r\n\r\n"Do boys ever get into the room after the door is locked?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"By what means?"\r\n\r\n"Through the side windows."\r\n\r\n"That will do."\r\n\r\nRussell here whispered something to Duncan, who at once left the room,\r\nand on returning, after a few minutes\' absence, gave Russell a nod so\r\nfull of significance that, like Lord Burleigh\'s shake of the head, it\r\nseemed to speak whole volumes at once.\r\n\r\nBarker was next brought forward, and questioned by Gibson.\r\n\r\n"Do you know that Williams is in the habit of using a particular kind of\r\nink?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is of a violet colour, and has a peculiar smell."\r\n\r\n"Could you recognise anything written with it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nGibson here handed to Barker the paper which had caused so much trouble.\r\n\r\n"Is that the kind of ink?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Do you know the handwriting on that paper?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; it is Williams\'s hand."\r\n\r\n"How can you tell?"\r\n\r\n"He makes his r\'s in a curious way."\r\n\r\n"Turn the paper over.  Have you ever seen wafers of that kind before?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; Williams has a box of them in his desk."\r\n\r\n"Has any other boy, that you are aware of wafers like them?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\nCross-examined by Duncan--\r\n\r\n"_How_ do you know that Williams has wafers like those?"\r\n\r\n"I have seen him use them."\r\n\r\n"For what purpose?"\r\n\r\n"To fasten letters."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help remarking that you seem very well acquainted with what he\r\ndoes.  Several of those who know him best, and have seen him oftenest,\r\nnever heard of these wafers.  May I ask," he said, "if any one else in\r\nthe school will witness to having seen Williams use these wafers?"\r\n\r\nNo one spoke, and Barker, whose malice seemed to have been changed into\r\nuneasiness, sat down.\r\n\r\nUpton was the next witness.  Gibson began--\r\n\r\n"You have seen a good deal of Williams?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Upton, smiling.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever heard him express any opinions of Mr Gordon?"\r\n\r\n"Often."\r\n\r\n"Of what kind?"\r\n\r\n"Dislike and contempt," said Upton, amidst general laughter.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever heard him say anything which implied a desire to injure\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"The other day Mr Gordon gave him a Georgic as an imposition, and I\r\nheard Williams say that he would like to pay him out."\r\n\r\nThis last fact was new to the school, and excited a great sensation.\r\n\r\n"When did he say this?"\r\n\r\n"On Friday afternoon."\r\n\r\nUpton had given his evidence with great reluctance, although, being\r\nsimply desirous that the truth should come out, he concealed nothing\r\nthat he knew.  He brightened up a little when Russell rose to\r\ncross-examine him.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever known Williams do any mean act?"\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Do you consider him a boy _likely_ to have been guilty on this\r\noccasion?"\r\n\r\n"Distinctly the reverse.  I am convinced of his innocence."\r\n\r\nThe answer was given with vehement emphasis, and Eric felt greatly\r\nrelieved by it.\r\n\r\nOne or two other boys were then called on as witnesses to the great\r\nagitation which Eric had shown during the investigation in the\r\nschoolroom, and then Gibson, who was a sensible self-contained fellow,\r\nsaid, "I have now done my part.  I have shown that the accused had a\r\ngrudge against Mr Gordon at the time the thing was done, and had\r\nthreatened to be revenged on him; that he was the last boy in the room\r\nduring the time when the offence must have been committed; that the\r\nhandwriting is known to be like his, and that the ink and wafers\r\nemployed were such as he, and he only, was known to possess.  In\r\naddition to all this, his behaviour, when the matter was first publicly\r\nnoticed, was exactly such as coincides with the supposition of his\r\nguilt.  I think you will all agree in considering these grounds of\r\nsuspicion very strong; and leaving them to carry their full weight with\r\nyou, I close the case for the prosecution."\r\n\r\nThe school listened to Gibson\'s quiet unmoved formality with a kind of\r\ngrim and gloomy satisfaction, and when he had concluded, there were\r\nprobably few but Eric\'s own immediate friends who were not fully\r\nconvinced of his guilt, however sorry they might be to admit so\r\nunfavourable an opinion of a companion whom they all admired.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute or two Russell rose for the defence, and asked, "Has\r\nWilliams any objection to his desk being brought, and any of its\r\ncontents put in as evidence?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least; there is the key, and you will find it in my place in\r\nschool."\r\n\r\nThe desk was brought, but it was found to be already unlocked, and\r\nRussell looked at some of the note-paper which it contained.  He then\r\nrose--nervously at first, and with a deep blush lighting up his face,\r\nbut soon showing a warmth and sarcasm, which few expected from his\r\ngentle nature.\r\n\r\n"In spite of the evidence adduced," he began, "I think I can show that\r\nWilliams is not guilty.  It is quite true that he dislikes Mr Gordon,\r\nand would not object to any open way of showing it; it is quite true\r\nthat he used the expressions attributed to him, and that the ink and\r\nwafers are such as may be found in his desk, and that the handwriting is\r\nnot unlike his.  But is it probable that a boy intending to post up an\r\ninsult such as this, would do so in a manner and at a time so likely to\r\ninvolve him in immediate detection and certain punishment?  At any rate,\r\nhe would surely disguise his usual handwriting.  Now, I ask any one to\r\nlook at this paper, and tell me whether it is not clear, on the\r\ncontrary, that these letters were traced slowly and with care, as would\r\nbe the case with an elaborate attempt to imitate?"  Russell here handed\r\nthe paper to the jury, who again narrowly examined it.\r\n\r\n"Now, the evidence of Pietrie and Carter is of no use, because Carter\r\nhimself admitted that boys often enter the room by the window--a fact to\r\nwhich we shall have to allude again.\r\n\r\n"We admit the evidence about the ink and wafers.  But it is rather\r\nstrange that Barker should know about the wafers, since neither I, nor\r\nany other friend of Williams, often as we have sat by him when writing\r\nletters, have ever observed that he possessed any like them."\r\n\r\nSeveral boys began to look at Barker, who was sitting very ill at ease\r\non the corner of a form, in vain trying to appear unconcerned.\r\n\r\n"There is another fact which no one yet knows, but which I must mention.\r\nIt will explain Eric\'s--I mean Williams\'s--agitation when Dr Rowlands\r\nread out the words on that paper; and, confident of his innocence, I am\r\nindifferent to its appearing to tell against him.  I myself once heard\r\nEric--I beg pardon, I mean Williams," (he said, correcting himself with\r\na smile)--"use the very words written on that paper, and not only heard\r\nthem, but expostulated with him strongly for the use of them.  I need\r\nhardly say how very unlikely it is that, remembering this, he should\r\nthus publicly draw my suspicions on him, if he meant to insult Mr\r\nGordon undiscovered.  But, besides myself there was another boy who\r\naccidentally overheard that expression.  That boy was Barker.\r\n\r\n"I have to bring forward a new piece of evidence, which at least ought\r\nto go for something.  Looking at this half-sheet of note-paper, I see\r\nthat the printer\'s name on the stamp in the corner is `Graves, York.\'\r\nNow, I have just found that there is no paper at all like this in\r\nWilliams\'s desk; all the note-paper it contains is marked `Blakes,\r\nAyrton.\'\r\n\r\n"I might bring many witnesses to prove how very unlike Williams\'s\r\ngeneral character a trick of this kind would be.  But I am not going to\r\ndo this.  We think we know the real offender.  We have had one trial,\r\nand now demand another.  It is our painful duty (but depend upon it we\r\nshall not shirk it," he added with unusual passion) "to prove Williams\'s\r\ninnocence by proving another\'s guilt.  That other is a known enemy of\r\nmine, and of Montagu\'s, and of Owen\'s.  We therefore leave the charge of\r\nstating the case against him to Duncan, with whom he has never\r\nquarrelled."\r\n\r\nRussell sat down amid general applause; he had performed his task with a\r\nwonderful modesty and self-possession, which filled every one with\r\nadmiration, and Eric warmly pressed his hand.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the school was intensely excited, and Duncan, after a\r\nminute\'s pause, starting up, said--\r\n\r\n"Williams has allowed his desk to be brought in and examined.  Will\r\nBarker do the same?"  The culprit now saw at once that his plot to ruin\r\nEric was recoiling on himself.  He got up, swore and blustered at\r\nRussell, Duncan, and Montagu, and at first flatly refused to allow his\r\ndesk to be brought.  He was, however, forced to yield, and when opened,\r\nit was immediately seen that the note-paper it contained was identical\r\nwith that on which the words had been written.  At this he affected to\r\nbe perfectly unconcerned, and merely protested against what he called\r\nthe meanness of trying to fix the charge on him.\r\n\r\n"And what have you been doing the whole of the last day or two," asked\r\nGibson quietly, "but endeavouring to fix the charge on another?"\r\n\r\n"We have stronger evidence against you," said Duncan, confronting him\r\nwith an undaunted look, before which his insolence quailed.  "Russell,\r\nwill you call Graham?"\r\n\r\nGraham was called, and put on his honour.\r\n\r\n"You were in the sick-room on Friday evening?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did you see any one get in to the schoolroom through the side window?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a leading question," interrupted Barker.\r\n\r\n"Stuff!" said Graham contemptuously, not vouchsafing further reply to\r\nthe objection.  "I\'ll just tell you all I know.  I was sitting doing\r\nnothing in the sick-room, when I suddenly saw Barker clamber into the\r\nschoolroom by the window, which he left open.  I was looking on simply\r\nfrom curiosity, and saw him search Williams\'s desk, from which he took\r\nout something, I could not make out what.  He then went to his own desk,\r\nand wrote for about ten minutes, after which I observed him go up and\r\nstand by the notice-board.  When he had done this, he got out by the\r\nwindow again, and ran off."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t this strike you as extraordinary?"\r\n\r\n"No; I thought nothing more about it till some one told me in the\r\nsick-room about this row.  I then mentioned privately what I had seen,\r\nand it wasn\'t till I saw Duncan, half an hour ago, that I thought it\r\nworth while to make it generally known."\r\n\r\nDuncan turned an inquiring eye to Barker (who sat black and silent), and\r\nthen pulled out some bits of torn paper from his pocket, put them\r\ntogether, and called Owen to stand up.  Showing him the fragments of\r\npaper, he asked, "Have you ever seen these before?"\r\n\r\n"Yes.  On Saturday, when the boys left the schoolroom, I stayed behind\r\nto think a little over what had occurred, feeling convinced that\r\nWilliams was _not_ guilty, spite of appearances.  I was standing by the\r\nempty fireplace, when these bits of paper caught my eye.  I picked them\r\nup, and, after a great deal of trouble, fitted them together.  They are\r\ncovered apparently with failures in an attempt at forgery, viz, first,\r\n`Gordon is a sur--\' and then a stop as though the writer were\r\ndissatisfied, and several of the words written over again for practice,\r\nand then a number of r\'s made in the way that Williams makes them."\r\n\r\n"There you may stop," said Barker, stamping fiercely; "I did it all."\r\n\r\nA perfect yell of scorn and execration followed this announcement.\r\n\r\n"What! _you_ did it, and caused all this trouble, you ineffable\r\nblackguard!" shouted Upton, grasping him with one hand, while he struck\r\nhim with the other.\r\n\r\n"Stop!" said Avonley; "just see that he doesn\'t escape, while we decide\r\non his punishment."\r\n\r\nIt was very soon decided by the sixth-form that he should run the\r\ngauntlet of the school.  The boys instantly took out their\r\nhandkerchiefs, and knotted them tight.  They then made a double line\r\ndown each side of the corridor, and turned Barker loose.  He stood\r\nstock-still at one end while the fellows nearest him thrashed him\r\nunmercifully with the heavy knots.  At last the pain was getting severe,\r\nand he moved on, finally beginning to run.  Five times he was forced up\r\nand down the line, and five times did every boy in the line give him a\r\nblow, which, if it did not hurt much, at least spoke of no slight anger\r\nand contempt.  He was dogged and unmoved to the last, and then Avonley\r\nhauled him into the presence of Dr Rowlands.  He was put in a secure\r\nroom by himself, and the next morning was first flogged and then\r\npublicly expelled.  Thenceforth he disappears from the history of Roslyn\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that neither Eric nor his friends took any part in\r\nthis retributive act; indeed they tried (though in vain) to prevent it.\r\nThey sat together in the boarders\' room till it was over, engaged in\r\nexciting discussion of the recent events.  Most warmly did Eric thank\r\nthem for their trustfulness.  "Thank you," he said, "with all my heart,\r\nfor proving my innocence; but thank you, even more a great deal, for\r\nfirst believing it."\r\n\r\nUpton was the first to join them, and since he had but wavered for a\r\nmoment, he was soon warmly reconciled with Eric.  They had hardly shaken\r\nhands when the rest came flocking in.  "We have all been unjust," said\r\nAvonley; "let\'s make up for it as well as we can.  Three cheers for Eric\r\nWilliams!"\r\n\r\nThey gave not three, but a dozen, till they were tired; and meanwhile\r\nevery one was pressing round him, telling him how sorry they were for\r\nthe false suspicion, and doing all they could to show their regret for\r\nhis recent troubles.  His genial, boyish heart readily forgave them, and\r\nhis eyes shone with joy.  The delicious sensation of returning esteem\r\nmade him almost think it worth while to have undergone his trial.\r\n\r\nMost happily did he spend the remainder of that afternoon, and it was no\r\nsmall relief to all the Rowlandites in the evening to find themselves\r\nfinally rid of Barker, whose fate no one pitied, and whose name no one\r\nmentioned without disgust.  He had done more than any other boy to\r\nintroduce meanness, quarrelling, and vice, and the very atmosphere of\r\nthe rooms seemed healthier in his absence.  One boy only forgave him,\r\none boy only prayed for him, one boy only endeavoured to see him for one\r\nlast kind word.  That boy was Edwin Russell.\r\n\r\nAfter prayers, Mr Gordon, who had been at Dr Rowlands\'s to dinner,\r\napologised to Eric amply and frankly for his note, and did and said all\r\nthat could be done by an honourable man to repair the injury of an\r\nunjust doubt.  Eric felt his generous humility, and from thenceforth,\r\nthough they were never friends, he and Mr Gordon ceased to be enemies.\r\n\r\nThat night Mr Rose crowned his happiness by asking him and his\r\ndefenders to supper in the library.  A most bright and joyous evening\r\nthey passed, for they were in the highest spirits; and when the master\r\nbade them "good-night," he kindly detained Eric, and said to him, "Keep\r\nan innocent heart, my boy, and you need never fear trouble.  Only think\r\nif you had been guilty, and were now in Barker\'s place!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I _couldn\'t_ be guilty, sir," said Eric, gaily.\r\n\r\n"Not of such a fault, perhaps.  But," he added solemnly, "there are many\r\nkinds of temptation, Eric; many kinds.  And they are easy to fall into.\r\nYou will find it no light battle to resist them."\r\n\r\n"Believe me, sir, I will try," he answered with humility.\r\n\r\n"Jehovah-Nissi!" said Mr Rose.  "Let the Lord be your banner, Eric, and\r\nyou will win the victory.  God bless you."\r\n\r\nAnd as the boy\'s graceful figure disappeared through the door, Mr Rose\r\ndrew his arm-chair to the fire, and sat and meditated long.  He was\r\nimagining for Eric a sunny future--a future of splendid usefulness, of\r\nreciprocated affection, of brilliant fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURE AT THE STACK.\r\n\r\n  Ten cables from where green meadows\r\n  And quiet homes could be seen,\r\n  No greater space\r\n  From peril to peace;\r\n  But the savage sea between!\r\n  _Edwin Arnold_.\r\n\r\nThe Easter holidays at Roslyn lasted about ten days, and as most of the\r\nboys came from a distance, they usually spent them at school.  Many of\r\nthe ordinary rules were suspended during this time, and the boys were\r\nsupplied every day with pocket money; consequently the Easter holidays\r\npassed very pleasantly, and there was plenty of fun.\r\n\r\nIt was the great time for excursions all over the island, and the boys\r\nwould often be out the whole day long among the hills, or about the\r\ncoast.  Eric enjoyed the time particularly, and was in great request\r\namong all the boys.  He was now more gay and popular than ever, and felt\r\nas if nothing were wanting to his happiness.  But this brilliant\r\nprosperity was not good for him, and he felt continually that he cared\r\nfar less for the reproaches of conscience than he had done in the hours\r\nof his trial; sought far less for help from God than he had done when he\r\nwas lonely and neglected.\r\n\r\nHe always knew that his great safeguard was the affection of Russell.\r\nFor Edwin\'s sake, and for shame at the thought of Edwin\'s disapproval,\r\nhe abstained from many things into which he would otherwise have\r\ninsensibly glided in conformation to the general looseness of the school\r\nmorality.  But Russell\'s influence worked on him powerfully, and tended\r\nto counteract a multitude of temptations.\r\n\r\nAmong other undesirable lessons Upton had taught Eric to smoke; and he\r\nwas now one of those who often spent a part of their holidays in lurking\r\nabout with pipes in their mouths at places where they were unlikely to\r\nbe disturbed, instead of joining in some hearty and healthy game.  When\r\nhe began to "learn" smoking, he found it anything but pleasant; but a\r\nlittle practice had made him an adept, and he found a certain amount of\r\nenjoyable excitement in finding out cosy places by the river, where he\r\nand Upton might go and lounge for an hour to enjoy the forbidden luxury.\r\n\r\nIn reality, he, like most boys, at first disliked the habit; but it\r\nseemed a fine thing to do, and to some, at any rate, it was a refuge\r\nfrom vacuity.  Besides, they had a confused notion that there was\r\nsomething "manly" in it, and it derived an additional zest from the\r\nstringency of the rules adopted to put it down.\r\n\r\nSo a number of the boys smoked, and some few of them to such excess as\r\nseriously to injure their health, and form a habit which they could\r\nnever afterwards abandon.\r\n\r\nOne morning of the Easter holidays, Eric, Montagu, and Russell started\r\nfor an excursion down the coast to Rilby Head.  As they passed through\r\nEllan, Eric was deputed to go and buy Easter eggs and other provisions,\r\nas they did not mean to be back for dinner.  In about ten minutes he\r\ncaught up the other two, just as they were getting out of the town.\r\n\r\n"What an age you\'ve been, buying a few Easter eggs," said Russell,\r\nlaughing; "have you been waiting till the hens laid?"\r\n\r\n"No; they\'re not the _only_ things I\'ve got."\r\n\r\n"Well, but you might have got all the grub at the same shop."\r\n\r\n"Ay; but I\'ve procured a more refined article.  Guess what it is."\r\n\r\nThe two boys didn\'t guess, and Eric said, to enlighten them, "Will you\r\nhave a whiff, Monty?"\r\n\r\n"A whiff!  Oh!  I see you\'ve been wasting your tin on cigars--alias,\r\nrolled cabbage-leaves.  O fumose puer!"\r\n\r\n"Well, will you have one?"\r\n\r\n"If you like," said Montagu, wavering; "but I don\'t much care to smoke."\r\n\r\n"Well, _I_ shall, at any rate," said Eric, keeping off the wind with his\r\ncap, as he lighted a cigar, and began to puff.\r\n\r\nThey strolled on in silence; the smoking didn\'t promote conversation,\r\nand Russell thought that he had never seen his friend look so\r\nridiculous, and entirely unlike himself, as he did while strutting along\r\nwith the weed in his mouth.  The fact was, Eric didn\'t guess how much he\r\nwas hurting Edwin\'s feelings, and he was smoking more to "make things\r\nlook like the holidays," by a little bravado, than anything else.  But\r\nsuddenly he caught the expression of Russell\'s face, and instantly\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n"Oh, I forgot, Edwin; I know you don\'t like smoking," and he instantly\r\nflung the cigar over the hedge, being really rather glad to get rid of\r\nit.  With the cigar, he seemed to have flung away the affected manner he\r\ndisplayed just before, and the spirits of all three rose at once.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t that I don\'t _like_ smoking only, Eric, but I think it wrong--\r\nfor _us_ I mean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear fellow! surely there can\'t be any harm in it.  Why,\r\neverybody smokes."\r\n\r\n"It may be all very well for men, although I\'m not so sure of that.\r\nBut, at any rate, it does nothing but harm to growing boys.  You know\r\nyourself what harm it does in every way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s a mere school rule against it.  How can it be wrong?  Why, I\r\neven know clergymen who smoke."\r\n\r\nMontagu laughed.  "Well, clergymen ain\'t immaculate," said he; "but I\r\nhave seldom met a man yet who didn\'t tell you that he was _sorry_ he\'d\r\nacquired the habit."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure you won\'t thank that rascally cousin of mine for having taught\r\nyou," said Russell; "but seriously, isn\'t it a very moping way of\r\nspending the afternoon, to go and lie down behind some haystack, or in\r\nsome frowsy tumble-down barn, as you smokers do, instead of playing\r\nracquets or football?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s pleasant enough sometimes," said Eric, speaking rather against\r\nhis own convictions.\r\n\r\n"As for me, I\'ve pretty nearly left it off," said Montagu, "and I think\r\nRose convinced me that it was a mistake.  Not that he knows that I ever\r\ndid smoke.  I should be precious sorry if he did, for I know how he\r\ndespises it in boys.  Were you in school the other day when he caught\r\nPietrie and Booking?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, when Booking went up to have his exercise corrected, Rose smelt\r\nthat he had been smoking, and charged him with it.  Booking stoutly\r\ndenied it, but after he had told the most robust lies, Rose made him\r\nempty his pockets, and there, sure enough, were a pipe and a cigar-case\r\nhalf full!  You _should_ have heard how Rose thundered and lightened at\r\nhim for his lying, and then sent him to the Doctor.  I never saw him so\r\nterrific before."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say you were convinced it was wrong because Booking\r\nwas caught, and told lies--do you?  _Non sequitur_."\r\n\r\n"Stop--not so fast.  Very soon after Rose twigged Pietrie, who at once\r\nconfessed, and was caned.  I happened to be in the library when Rose\r\nsent for him, and Pietrie said mildly that `he didn\'t see the harm of\r\nit.\'  Rose smiled in his kind way, and said, `Don\'t see the _harm_ of\r\nit!  Do you see any good in it?\'\r\n\r\n"`No, sir.\'\r\n\r\n"`Well, isn\'t it forbidden?\'\r\n\r\n"`Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n"`And doesn\'t it waste your money?\'\r\n\r\n"`Yes, sir.\'\r\n\r\n"`And tempt you to break rules, and tell lies to screen yourself?\'\r\n\r\n"`Yes, sir,\' said Pietrie, looking unusually crestfallen.\r\n\r\n"`And don\'t your parents disapprove it?  And doesn\'t it throw you among\r\nsome of the worst boys, and get you into great troubles?  Silly fellow,\'\r\nhe said, pulling Pietrie\'s ear (as he sometimes does, you know), `don\'t\r\ntalk nonsense; and remember next time you\'re caught, I shall have you\r\npunished.\'  So off went Pietrie, _achreion idon_, as our friend Homer\r\nsays.  And your humble servant was convinced."\r\n\r\n"Well, well!" said Eric, laughing, "I suppose you\'re right.  At any\r\nrate, I give in.  Two to one ain\'t fair:--_pros duo oud\' Eraklon_, since\r\nyou\'re in a quoting humour."\r\n\r\nTalking in this way they got to Rilby Head, where they found plenty to\r\namuse them.  It was a splendid headland, rising bluff four hundred feet\r\nout of the sea, and presenting magnificent reaches of rock scenery on\r\nall sides.  The boys lay on the turf at the summit, and flung innocuous\r\nstones at the sea-gulls as they sailed far below them over the water and\r\nevery now and then pounced at some stray fish that came to the surface;\r\nor they watched the stately barques as they sailed by on the horizon,\r\nwondering at their cargo and destination; or chaffed the fisherman,\r\nwhose boats heaved on the waves at the foot of the promontory.  When\r\nthey were rested, they visited a copper-mine by the side of the Head,\r\nand filled their pockets with bits of bright quartz or red shining spar,\r\nwhich they found in plenty among the rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon they strolled towards home, determining to stop a\r\nlittle at the Stack on their way.  The Stack formed one of the\r\nextremities of Ellan Bay, and was a huge mass of isolated schist,\r\naccessible at low water, but entirely surrounded at high tide.  It was a\r\nvery favourite resort of Eric\'s, as the coast all about it was bold and\r\nromantic; and he often went there with Russell on a Sunday evening to\r\nwatch the long line of golden radiance slanting to them over the water\r\nfrom the setting sun--a sight which they agreed to consider one of the\r\nmost peaceful and mysteriously beautiful in nature.\r\n\r\nThey reached the Stack, and began to climb to its summit.  The sun was\r\njust preparing to set, and the west was gorgeous with red and gold.\r\n\r\n"We shan\'t see the line on the waters this evening," said Eric; "there\'s\r\ntoo much of a breeze.  But look, what a glorious sunset!"\r\n\r\n"It is indeed," said Russell; "it reminds me of what Rose said the other\r\nday; we were standing on the top of Brada, leaning against a heap of\r\nstones to keep off the north-easter, and Rose suddenly exclaimed, `Look,\r\nEdwin, how that crimson sunset burns itself away like a thought of\r\ndeath, judgment, and eternity, all in one!\'  I wonder what he meant?"\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be stormy to-morrow," said Montagu; "but come along, let\'s get to\r\nthe top; the wind\'s rising, and the waves will be rather grand."\r\n\r\n"Ay, we\'ll sit and watch them; and let\'s finish our grub; I\'ve got\r\nseveral eggs left, and I want to get them out of my pocket."\r\n\r\nThey devoured the eggs, and then stood enjoying the sight of the waves,\r\nwhich sometimes climbed up the rock almost to their feet, and then fell\r\nback, hissing and discomfited.  Suddenly they remembered that it was\r\ngetting late, and that they ought to get home for tea at seven.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" said Russell, looking at his watch, "it\'s half-past six.  We\r\nmust cut back as hard as we can.  By the bye, I hope the tide hasn\'t\r\nbeen coming in all this time."\r\n\r\n"My goodness!" said Montagu, with a violent start, "I\'m afraid it has,\r\nthough!  What asses we have been, with our waves and sunsets.  Let\'s set\r\noff as hard as we can pelt."\r\n\r\nImmediately they scrambled, by the aid of hands and knees, down the\r\nStack, and made their way for the belt of rock which joined it to the\r\nmainland; but to their horror, they at once saw that the tide had come\r\nin, and that a narrow gulf of sea already divided them from the shore.\r\n\r\n"There\'s only one way for it," said Eric; "if we\'re plucky, we can jump\r\nthat; but we mustn\'t wait till it gets worse.  A good jump will take us\r\n_nearly_ to the other side--far enough, at any rate, to let us flounder\r\nacross somehow."\r\n\r\nAs fast as they could they hurried along down to the place where the\r\nmomentarily increasing zone of water seemed as yet to be narrowest, and\r\nwhere the rocks on the other side were lower than those, on which they\r\nstood.  Their situation was by no means pleasant.  The wind had been\r\nrising more and more, and the waves dashed into this little channel with\r\nsuch violence, that to swim it would have been a most hazardous\r\nexperiment, particularly as they could not dive in from the ledge, on\r\nwhich they stood, from their ignorance of the depth of water.\r\n\r\nEric\'s courage supported the other two.  "There\'s no good _thinking_\r\nabout it," said he, "jump we _must_; the sooner the better.  We can but\r\nbe a little hurt at the worst.  Here, I\'ll set the example."\r\n\r\nHe drew back a step or two, and sprang out with all his force.  He was a\r\npractised and agile jumper, and, to their great relief he alighted near\r\nthe water\'s edge, on the other side, where, after slipping once or twice\r\non the wet and seaweed-covered rocks, he effected a safe landing, with\r\nno worse harm than a wetting up to the knees.\r\n\r\n"Now then, you two," he shouted; "no time to lose."\r\n\r\n"Will you jump first, Monty?" said Russell; "both of you are better\r\njumpers than I, and to tell the truth, I\'m rather afraid."\r\n\r\n"Then I won\'t leave you," said Montagu; "we\'ll both stay here."\r\n\r\n"And perhaps be drowned or starved for our pains.  No, Monty, _you_ can\r\nclear it, I\'ve no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t we try to swim it together, Edwin?"\r\n\r\n"Madness! look there."  And as he spoke, a huge furious wave swept down\r\nthe entire length of the gulf, by which he stood, roaring and surging\r\nalong till the whole water seethed, and tearing the seaweeds from their\r\nroots in the rock.\r\n\r\n"Now\'s your time," shouted Eric again.  "What _are_ you waiting for?\r\nFor God\'s sake, jump before another wave comes."\r\n\r\n"Monty, you _must_ jump now," said Russell, "if only to help me when I\r\ntry."\r\n\r\nMontagu went back as far as he could, which was only a few steps, and\r\nleapt wildly forward.  He lighted into deep water, nearly up to his\r\nneck, and at first tried in vain to secure a footing on the sharp\r\nslippery schist; but, after a complete ducking, he stumbled forwards\r\nvigorously, and in half a minute, Eric leaning out as far as he could,\r\ncaught his hand, and just pulled him to the other side in time to escape\r\nanother rush of tumultuous and angry foam.\r\n\r\n"Now, Edwin," they both shouted, "it\'ll be too late in another minute.\r\nJump for your life."\r\n\r\nRussell stood on the rock pale and irresolute.  Once or twice he\r\nprepared to spring, and stopped from fear at the critical instant.  In\r\ntruth, the leap was now most formidable; to clear it was hopeless; and\r\nthe fury of the rock-tormented waves rendered the prospect of a swim on\r\nthe other side terrible to contemplate.  Once in the grasp of one of\r\nthose billows, even a strong man must have been carried out of the\r\nnarrow channel, and hurled against the towering sweep of rocks which lay\r\nbeyond it.\r\n\r\n"O Edwin, Edwin--dear Edwin--do jump!" cried Eric with passionate\r\nexcitement.  "We will rush in for you."\r\n\r\nRussell now seemed to have determined on running the risk; he stepped\r\nback, ran to the edge, missed his footing, and, with a sharp cry of\r\npain, fell heavily forward into the water.  For an instant Eric and\r\nMontagu stood breathless,--but the next instant, they saw Russell\'s head\r\nemerge, and then another wave foaming madly by, made them run backwards\r\nfor their lives, and hid him from their view.  When it had passed, they\r\nsaw him clinging with both hands, in the desperate instinct of\r\nself-preservation, to a projecting bit of rock, by the aid of which he\r\ngradually dragged himself out of the water, and grasping at crevices or\r\nbits of seaweed, slowly and painfully reached the ledge on which they\r\nhad stood before they took the leap.  He presented a pitiable spectacle;\r\nhis face, pale as death, was dabbled with blood; his head drooped on his\r\nbreast; his clothes were torn, and streamed with the salt water; his cap\r\nwas gone, and the wet hair, which he seemed too exhausted to push aside,\r\nhung in heavy masses over his forehead and eyes.  He was evidently\r\ndizzy, and in pain; and they noticed that he only seemed to use one\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nWhile he was regaining the ledge, neither of the boys spoke, lest their\r\nvoices should startle him, and make him fall; but now they both cried\r\nout, "Are you hurt, Edwin?"\r\n\r\nHe did not answer, but supported his pale face on one hand, while he put\r\nthe other to his head, from which the blood was flowing fast.\r\n\r\n"O Edwin, for the love of God, try once more," said Montagu; "you will\r\ndie if you spend the night on that rock."\r\n\r\nThey could not catch the reply, and called again.  The wind and waves\r\nwere both rising fast, and it was only by listening intently, that they\r\ncaught the faint words, "I can\'t, my leg is hurt."  Besides, they both\r\nsaw that a jump was no longer possible; the channel was more than double\r\nthe width which it had been when Eric leaped, and from the rapid ascent\r\nof the rocks on both sides, it was now far out of depth.\r\n\r\n"O God, what can we do?" said Montagu, bursting into tears.  "We can\r\nnever save him, and all but the very top of the Stack is covered at high\r\ntide."\r\n\r\nEric had not lost his presence of mind, "Cheer up, Edwin," he shouted,\r\n"I _will_ get back to you somehow.  If I fail, crawl up to the top\r\nagain."\r\n\r\nAgain the wind carried away the reply, and Russell had sunk back on the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n"Monty," said Eric, "just watch for a minute or two.  When I have got\r\nacross, run to Ellan as hard as you can tear, and tell them that we are\r\ncut off by the tide on the Stack.  They\'ll bring round the lifeboat.\r\nIt\'s our only chance."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" asked Montagu, terrified.  "Why, Eric, it\'s\r\ndeath to attempt swimming that.  Good heavens!"  And he drew Eric back\r\nhastily, as another vast swell of water came rolling along, shaking its\r\nwhite curled mane, like a sea-monster bent on destruction.\r\n\r\n"Monty, it\'s no use," said Eric, hastily tearing off his jacket and\r\nwaistcoat; "I\'m not going to let Russell die on that ledge of rock.  I\r\nshall try to reach him, whatever happens to me.  Here; I want to keep\r\nthese things dry.  Be on the look-out; if I get across, fling them over\r\nto me if you can, and then do as I told you."\r\n\r\nHe turned round; the wave had just spent its fury, and knowing that his\r\nonly chance was to swim over before another came, he plunged in, and\r\nstruck out like a man.  He was a strong and expert swimmer, and as yet\r\nthe channel was not more than a dozen yards across.  He dashed over with\r\nthe speed and strength of despair, and had just time to clutch the rocks\r\non the other side before the next mighty swirl of the tide swept up in\r\nits white and tormented course.  In another minute he was on the ledge\r\nby Russell\'s side.\r\n\r\nHe lifted him tenderly, and called to Montagu for the dry clothes.\r\nMontagu tied them skilfully with his neck-handkerchief round a fragment\r\nof rock, adding his own wet jacket to the bundle, and then flung it\r\nover.  Eric wrapped up his friend in the clothes, and once more shouted\r\nto Montagu to go on his errand.  For a short time the boy lingered,\r\nreluctant to leave them.  Then he started off at a run.  Looking back\r\nafter a few minutes, he caught, through the gathering dusk, his last\r\nglimpse of the friends in their perilous situation.  Eric was seated\r\nsupporting Russell across his knees.  When he saw Montagu turn, he waved\r\nhis cap over his head as a signal of encouragement, and then began to\r\ncarry Edwin higher up the rock for safety.  It soon grew too dark to\r\ndistinguish them, and Montagu at full speed flew to Ellan, which was a\r\nmile off.  When he got to the harbour he told some sailors of the\r\ndanger, in which his friends were, and then ran on to the school.  It\r\nwas now eight o\'clock, and quite dark.  Tea was over, and lock-up time\r\nlong past, when he stood wet through, excited, breathless, and without\r\ncap or jacket, at Dr Rowlands\'s door.\r\n\r\n"Good gracious!  Master Montagu," said the servant; "what\'s the matter;\r\nhave you been robbed?"\r\n\r\nHe pushed the girl aside, and ran straight to Dr Rowlands\'s study.\r\n"Oh, sir!" he exclaimed, bursting in, "Eric and Russell are on the\r\nStack, cut off by the tide."\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands started up hastily.  "What! on this stormy night?  Have you\r\nraised the alarm?"\r\n\r\n"I told the lifeboat people, sir, and then ran on."\r\n\r\n"I will set off myself at once," said the Doctor, seizing his hat.\r\n"But, my poor boy, how pale and ill you look, and you are wet through\r\ntoo.  You had better change your clothes at once, or go to bed."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, sir," said Montagu pleadingly; "do take me with you."\r\n\r\n"Very well; but you must change first, or you may suffer in consequence.\r\nMake all haste, and directly you are dressed, a cup of tea shall be\r\nready for you down here, and we will start."\r\n\r\nMontagu was off in an instant, and only stopped on his way to tell\r\nDuncan and the others of the danger which threatened their companions.\r\nThe absence of the three boys from tea and lock-up had already excited\r\ngeneral surmise, and Montagu\'s appearance, jacketless and wet, at the\r\ndoor of the boarders\' room, at once attracted a group round him.  He\r\nrapidly told them how things stood, and, hastening off, left them nearly\r\nas much agitated as himself.  In a very short time he presented himself\r\nagain before Dr Rowlands, and when he had with difficulty swallowed the\r\ncup of tea, they sallied out.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch dark, and only one or two stars were seen at intervals\r\nstruggling through the ragged masses of cloud.  The wind howled in\r\nfitful gusts, and as their road led by the sea-side, Montagu shuddered\r\nto hear how rough and turbulent the sea was, even on the sands.  He\r\nstumbled once or twice, and then the Doctor kindly drew his trembling\r\narm through his own, and made him describe the whole occurrence, while\r\nthe servant went on in front with the lantern.  When Montagu told how\r\nEric had braved the danger of reaching his friend at the risk of his\r\nlife, Dr Rowlands\'s admiration was unbounded.  "Fine lad!" he\r\nexclaimed, with enthusiasm; "I shall find it hard to believe any evil of\r\nhim after this."\r\n\r\nThey reached Ellan, and went to the boathouse.\r\n\r\n"Have you put out the lifeboat?" said Dr Rowlands anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Ill luck, sir," said one of the sailors, touching his cap; "the\r\nlifeboat went to a wreck at Port Vash two days ago, and she hasn\'t been\r\nbrought round again yet."\r\n\r\n"Indeed! but I do trust you have sent out another boat to try and save\r\nthose poor boys."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been trying, sir, and a boat has just managed to start; but in a\r\nsea like that it\'s very dangerous, and it\'s so dark and gusty that I\r\ndoubt it\'s no use, so I expect they\'ll put back."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor sighed deeply.  "Don\'t alarm any other people," he said; "it\r\nwill merely raise a crowd to no purpose.  Here, George," he continued to\r\nthe servant, "give me the lantern; I will go with this boy to the Stack;\r\nyou follow us with ropes, and order a carriage from the King\'s Head.\r\nTake care to bring anything with you that seems likely to be useful."\r\n\r\nMontagu and Dr Rowlands again started, and with difficulty made their\r\nway through the storm to the shore opposite the Stack.  Here they raised\r\nthe lantern and shouted; but the wind was now screaming with such\r\nviolence that they were not sure that they heard any answering shout.\r\nTheir eyes, accustomed to the darkness, could just make out the huge\r\nblack outline of the Stack rising from the yeast of boiling waves, and\r\nenveloped every moment in blinding sheets of spray.  On the top of it\r\nMontagu half thought that he saw something, but he was not sure.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, there is yet hope," said the Doctor, with difficulty making\r\nhis young companion catch his words amid the uproar of the elements; "if\r\nthey can but keep warm in their wet clothes, we may perhaps rescue them\r\nbefore morning."\r\n\r\nAgain he shouted to cheer them with his strong voice, and Montagu joined\r\nhis clear ringing tones to the shout.  This time they fancied that in\r\none of the pauses of the wind they heard a faint cheer returned.  Never\r\nwas sound more welcome, and as they paced up and down they shouted at\r\nintervals, and held up the lantern, to show the boys that friends and\r\nhelp were near.\r\n\r\nEric heard them.  When Montagu left, he had carried Russell to the\r\nhighest point of the rock, and there, with gentle hands and soothing\r\nwords, made him as comfortable as he could.  He wrapped him in every\r\npiece of dry clothing he could find, and supported his head, heedless of\r\nthe blood which covered him.  Very faintly Russell thanked him, and\r\npressed his hand; but he moaned with pain continually, and at last\r\nfainted away.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wind rose higher, and the tide gained on the rocks, and\r\nthe sacred darkness came down.  At first Eric could think of nothing but\r\nstorm and sea.  Cold, and cruel, and remorseless, the sea beat up,\r\ndrenching them to the skin continually with its clammy spray; and the\r\nstorm shrieked round them pitilessly, and flung about the wet hair on\r\nEric\'s bare head, and forced him to plant himself firmly, lest the rage\r\nof the gusts should hurl them from their narrow resting-place.  The\r\ndarkness made everything more fearful, for his eyes could distinguish\r\nnothing but the gulfs of black water glistening here and there with\r\nhissing foam, and he shuddered as his ears caught the unearthly noises\r\nthat came to him in the mingled scream of weltering tempest and plangent\r\nwave.  It was fearful to be isolated on the black rent rock, and see the\r\nwaves gaining on them, higher, higher, higher, every moment; and he was\r\nin ceaseless terror lest they should be swept away by the violence of\r\nthe breakers.  "At least," thought he, as he looked down and saw that\r\nthe ledge on which they had been standing had long been covered with\r\ndeep and agitated waves--"at least I have tried to save Edwin\'s life."\r\nAnd he bravely made up his mind to keep up heart and hope, and to\r\nweather the comfortless night as best he could.\r\n\r\nAnd then his thoughts turned to Russell, who was still unconscious; and\r\nstooping down he folded his arms around the boy\'s breast.  He felt\r\n_then_ how deeply he loved him, how much he owed him; and no mother\r\ncould have nursed a child more tenderly than he did his fainting friend.\r\nRussell\'s head rested on his breast, and the soft hair, tangled with\r\nwelling blood, stained his clothes.  Eric feared that he would die, his\r\nfainting-fit continued so long, and from the helpless way in which one\r\nof his legs trailed on the ground, he felt sure that he had received\r\nsome dangerous hurt.\r\n\r\nAt last Russell stirred and groaned.  "Where am I?" he said, and half\r\nopened his eyes; he started up frightened, and fell back heavily.  He\r\nsaw only the darkness; felt only the fierce wind and salt mist; heard\r\nonly the relentless fury of the blast.  Memory had no time to wake, and\r\nhe screamed and fainted once more.\r\n\r\nPoor Eric knew not what to do but to shelter him to the best of his\r\npower; and when he showed any signs of consciousness again, he bent over\r\nhim, and said, "Don\'t you remember, Edwin?  We\'re quite safe.  I\'m with\r\nyou, and Monty\'s gone for help."\r\n\r\n"Oh!  I daren\'t jump," sobbed Russell; "O mother, I shall be drowned.\r\nSave me! save me!  I\'m so glad they\'re safe, mother; but my leg hurts\r\nso."  And he moaned again.  He was delirious.\r\n\r\n"How cold it is, and wet too! where\'s Eric? are we bathing?--run along,\r\nwe shall be late.  But stop, you\'re smoking.  Dear Eric, don\'t smoke.\r\nPoor fellow, I\'m afraid he\'s getting spoilt, and learning bad ways.  Oh\r\nsave him."  And as he wandered on, he repeated a prayer for Eric, which\r\nevidently had been often on his lips.\r\n\r\nEric was touched to the heart\'s core, and in one rapid lightning-like\r\nglance, his memory revealed to him the faultful past, in all its\r\nsorrowfulness.  And _he_ too prayed wildly for help both for soul and\r\nbody.  Alone on the crag, with the sea tumbling and plashing round them,\r\ngrowing and gaining so much on their place of refuge, that his terror\r\nbegan to summon up the image of certain death; alone, wet, hungry, and\r\nexhausted, with the wounded and delirious boy, whose life depended on\r\nhis courage, he prayed as he had never prayed before, and seemed to grow\r\ncalmer by his prayer, and to feel God nearer him than ever he had done\r\nin the green cricket-field, or the safe dormitories of Roslyn School.\r\n\r\nA shout startled him.  Lights on the water heaved up and down, now\r\ndisappearing, and now lifted high, and at intervals there came the sound\r\nof voices and the plash of irregular oars.  Thank God! help was near;\r\nthey were coming in a boat to save them.\r\n\r\nBut the lights grew more distant; he saw them disappearing towards the\r\nharbour.  Yes; it was of no use; no boat could live in the surf at the\r\nfoot of the Stack cliffs, and the sailors had given it up in despair.\r\nHis heart sank again, all the more for its glimpse of hope, and his\r\nstrength began to give way.  Russell\'s delirium continued, and he grew\r\ntoo frightened even to pray.\r\n\r\nA light from the land.  The sound of shouts--yes, he could be sure of\r\nit; it was Dr Rowlands\'s voice and Montagu\'s.  He got convinced of\r\nthis, and summoned all his strength to shout in return.  The light kept\r\nmoving up and down on the shore, not a hundred yards off.  His fear\r\nvanished; they were no longer alone.  The first moment that the tide\r\nsuffered any one to reach them they would be rescued.  His mind grew\r\ncalm again, and he determined to hold up for Russell\'s sake until help\r\nshould come; and every now and then, to make it feel less lonely, he\r\nanswered the shouts which came from the friendly voices in the fitful\r\npauses of the storm.\r\n\r\nBut Dr Rowlands and Montagu paced up and down, and the master soothed\r\nthe boy\'s fears, and talked to him so kindly, so gently, that Montagu\r\nbegan to wonder if this really could be the awful head-master, whose\r\nwarm strong hand he was grasping, and who was comforting him as a father\r\nmight.  What a depth of genuine human kindness that stern exterior\r\nconcealed!  And every now and then, when the storm blew loudest, the\r\nDoctor would stand still for a moment, and offer up a short intense\r\nprayer or ejaculation, that help and safety might come to his beloved\r\ncharge in their exposure and peril.\r\n\r\nSix or seven hours passed away; at last the wind began to sink, and the\r\nsea to be less violent.  The tide was on the turn.  The carriage drove\r\nup with more men and lights, and the thoughtful servant brought with him\r\nthe school surgeon, Dr Underhay.  Long and anxiously did they watch the\r\nebbing tide, and when it had gone out sufficiently to allow of two stout\r\nplanks being fastened securely to the rocks and laid across the channel,\r\nan active sailor ventured over with a light, and in a few moments stood\r\nby Eric\'s side.  Eric saw him coming, but was too weak and numb to move;\r\nand when the sailor lifted up the unconscious Russell from his knees,\r\nEric was too much exhausted even to speak.  The man returned for him,\r\nand lifting him on his back, crossed the plank once more in safety.\r\nThen he carried Russell first and Eric afterwards to the carriage, where\r\nDr Underhay had taken care to have everything likely to revive and\r\nsustain them.  They were driven rapidly to the school, and the Doctor\r\nraised to God tearful eyes of gratitude as the boys were taken to the\r\nrooms prepared for them.  Mrs Rowlands was anxiously awaiting their\r\narrival, and the noise of wheels was the signal for twenty heads to be\r\nput through the dormitory windows, with many an anxious inquiry, "Are\r\nthey safe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank God!" called Dr Rowlands; "so now, boys, shut the windows,\r\nand get to sleep."\r\n\r\nRussell was carefully undressed, and put to bed in the Doctor\'s own\r\nhouse, and the wound in his head was dressed.  Eric and Montagu had beds\r\nprovided them in another room by themselves, away from the dormitories;\r\nthe room was bright and cheerful with a blazing fire, and looked like\r\nhome; and when the two boys had drunk some warm wine, and cried for\r\nweariness and joy, they sank to sleep after their dangers and fatigues,\r\nand slept the deep, calm, dreamless sleep of tired children.\r\n\r\nSo ended the perilous adventure of that eventful night of the Easter\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SILVER CORD BROKEN.\r\n\r\n  Calm on the bosom of thy God,\r\n  Fair spirit rest thee now!\r\n  E\'en while with us thy footsteps trod,\r\n  His seal was on thy brow.\r\n  _Mrs Hemans_.\r\n\r\nThey did not awake till noon.  Montagu opened his eyes, and at first\r\ncould not collect his thoughts, as he saw the carpeted little room, the\r\nbright fire, and the housekeeper seated in her arm-chair before it.  But\r\nturning his head he caught a glimpse of Eric, who was still asleep, and\r\nhe then remembered all.  He sprang out of bed, refreshed and perfectly\r\nwell, and the sound of his voice woke Eric; but Eric was still languid\r\nand weak, and did not get up that day, nor was he able to go to work\r\nagain for some days; but he was young and strong, and his vigorous\r\nconstitution soon threw off the effects of this fast and exposure.\r\n\r\nTheir first inquiry was for Edwin.  The nurse shook her head sadly.  "He\r\nis very dangerously ill."\r\n\r\n"Is he?" said they both anxiously.  And then they preserved a deep\r\nsilence; and when Montagu, who immediately began to dress, knelt down to\r\nsay his prayers, Eric, though unable to get up, knelt also over his\r\npillow, and the two felt that their young earnest prayers were mingling\r\nfor the one who seemed to have been taken while they were left.\r\n\r\nThe reports grew darker and darker about Edwin.  At first it was thought\r\nthat the blow on his head was dangerous, and that the exposure to wet,\r\ncold, fear, and hunger had permanently weakened his constitution; and\r\nwhen his youth seemed to be triumphing over these dangers, another\r\nbecame more threatening.  His leg never mended; he had both sprained the\r\nknee badly, and given the tibia an awkward twist, so that the least\r\nmotion was agony to him.\r\n\r\nIn his fever he was constantly delirious.  No one was allowed to see\r\nhim, though many of the boys tried to do so, and many were the earnest\r\ninquiries for him day by day.  It then became more fully apparent than\r\never, that, although Edwin was among them without being _of_ them, no\r\nboy in the school was more deeply honoured and fondly loved than he.\r\nEven the elastic spirits of boyhood could not quite throw off the shadow\r\nof gloom which his illness cast over the school.\r\n\r\nVery tenderly they nursed him.  All that human kindness could do was\r\ndone for him by the stranger hands.  And yet not all; poor Edwin had no\r\nfather, no mother, hardly any relatives.  His only aunt, Mrs Upton,\r\nwould have come to nurse him, but she was an invalid, and he was often\r\nleft alone in his delirium and agony.\r\n\r\nAlone, yet not alone.  There was One with him--always in his thoughts,\r\nalways leading, guiding, blessing him unseen--not deserting the hurt\r\nlamb of His flock; one who was once a boy Himself, and who, when He was\r\na boy, did His Father\'s business, and was subject unto His parents in\r\nthe obscure home of the despised village.  Alone! nay, to them whose\r\neyes were opened, the room of sickness and pain was thronged and\r\nbeautiful with angelic presences.\r\n\r\nOften did Eric, and Upton, and Montagu talk of their loved friend.\r\nEric\'s life seemed absorbed in the thought of him, and in passionate,\r\nunspeakable longings for his recovery.  Now he valued more than ever the\r\nhappy hours which he had spent with him; their games, and communings,\r\nand walks, and Russell\'s gentle influence, and brave kindly rebukes.\r\nYet he must not even see him, must not smooth his pillow, must not\r\nwhisper one word of soothing to him in his anguish; he could only pray\r\nfor him, and that he did with a depth of hope.\r\n\r\nAt last Upton, in virtue of his relationship, was allowed to visit him.\r\nHis delirium had become more unfrequent, but he could not yet even\r\nrecognise his cousin, and the visits to the sick-room were so sad and\r\nuseless, that Upton forbore.  "And yet you should hear him talk in his\r\ndelirium," he said to Eric; "not one evil word, or bad thought, or\r\nwicked thing, ever escapes him.  I\'m afraid, Eric, it would hardly be so\r\nwith you or me."\r\n\r\n"No," said Eric, in a low and humble tone; and guilty conscience brought\r\nthe deep colour, wave after wave of crimson, into his cheeks.\r\n\r\n"And he talks with such affection of you, Eric.  He speaks sometimes of\r\nall of us very gently; but you seem to be always in his thoughts, and\r\nevery now and then he prays for you quite unconsciously."\r\n\r\nEric turned his head to brush away a tear.  "When do you think I shall\r\nbe allowed to see him?"\r\n\r\n"Not just yet, I fear."\r\n\r\nAfter a week or two of most anxious suspense, Russell\'s mind ceased to\r\nwander, but the state of his sprain gave more cause for alarm.  Fresh\r\nadvice was called in, and it was decided that the leg must be amputated.\r\n\r\nWhen Eric was told this, he burst into passionate complaints.  "Only\r\nthink, Monty, isn\'t it hard, isn\'t it cruel?  When we see our brave,\r\nbright Edwin again he will be a cripple."  Eric hardly understood that\r\nhe was railing at the providence of a merciful God.\r\n\r\nThe day for the operation came.  When it was over, poor Russell seemed\r\nto amend, and the removal of the perpetual pain gave him relief.  They\r\nwere all deeply moved at his touching resignation; no murmur, no cry\r\nescaped him; no words but the sweetest thanks for every little office of\r\nkindness done to him.  A few days after, he asked Dr Underhay, "if he\r\nmight see Eric?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my boy," said the Doctor kindly, "he, and one or two others of\r\nyour particular friends may see you if you like, provided you don\'t\r\nexcite yourself too much.  I trust that you will get better now."\r\n\r\nSo Eric and Montagu were told by Dr Rowlands that at six they might go\r\nand see their friend.  "Be sure," he added, "that you don\'t startle or\r\nexcite him."\r\n\r\nThey promised, and after school on that beautiful evening of early\r\nsummer they went to the sick-room door.  Stopping, they held their\r\nbreath, and knocked very gently.  Yes! it was the well-known voice which\r\ngave the answer, but it was faint and low.  Full of awe, they softly\r\nopened the door, which admitted them into the presence of the dear\r\ncompanion whom they had not seen for so long.  Since then it seemed as\r\nthough gulfs far deeper than the sea had been flowing between him and\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFull of awe, and hand in hand, they entered the room on tiptoe--the\r\ndarkened room where Russell was.  What a hush and oppression there\r\nseemed to them at first in the dim, silent chamber; what an awfulness in\r\nall the appliances which showed how long and deeply their schoolfellow\r\nhad suffered.  But all this vanished directly they caught sight of his\r\nface.  There he lay, so calm, and weak, and still, with his bright,\r\nearnest eyes turned towards them as though to see whether any of their\r\naffection for him had ceased or been forgotten!\r\n\r\nIn an instant they were kneeling in silence by the bed with bowed\r\nforeheads; and the sick boy tenderly put his hands on their heads, and\r\npushed his thin white fingers through their hair, and looked at them\r\ntearfully without a word, till they hid their faces with their hands,\r\nand broke into deep suppressed sobs of compassion.\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, hush!" he said, as he felt their tears dropping on his hands;\r\n"dear Eric, dear Monty, why should you cry so for me?  I am very happy."\r\n\r\nBut they caught the outline of his form as he lay on the bed, and had\r\nnow for the first time realised that he was a cripple for life; and as\r\nthe throng of memories came on them--memories of his skill and fame at\r\ncricket, and racquets, and football--of their sunny bathes together in\r\nsea and river, and all their happy holiday wanderings--they could not\r\nrestrain their emotion, and wept uncontrollably.  Neither of them could\r\nspeak a word, or break the holy silence; and as he patted their heads\r\nand cheeks, his own tears flowed fast in sympathy and self-pity.  But he\r\nfelt the comforting affection which they could not utter; he felt it in\r\nhis loneliness, and it did him good.\r\n\r\nThe nurse broke in upon the scene, which she feared would agitate Edwin\r\ntoo much; and with red eyes and heavy hearts the boys left, only\r\nwhispering, "We will come again to-morrow, Edwin!"\r\n\r\nThey came the next day and many days, and got to talk quite cheerfully\r\nwith him, and read to him.  They loved this occupation more than any\r\ngame, and devoted themselves to it.  The sorrow of the sick-room more\r\nthan repaid them for the glad life without, when they heard Russell\'s\r\nsimple and heartfelt thanks.  "Ah! how good of you, dear fellows," he\r\nwould say, "to give up the merry playground for a wretched cripple," and\r\nhe would smile cheerfully to show that his trial had not made him weary\r\nof life.  Indeed, he often told them that he believed they felt for him\r\nmore than he did himself.\r\n\r\nOne day Eric brought him a little bunch of primroses and violets.  He\r\nseemed much better, and Eric\'s spirits were high with the thoughts and\r\nhopes of the coming holidays.  "There, Edwin," he said, as the boy\r\ngratefully and eagerly took the flowers, "don\'t they make you glad?\r\nThey are one of our _three_ signs, you know, of the approaching\r\nholidays.  One sign was the first sight of the summer steamer going\r\nacross the bay; another was May eve, when these island-fellows light big\r\ngorse fires all over the mountains, and throw yellow marsh-lilies at\r\ntheir doors to keep off the fairies.  Do you remember, Eddy, gathering\r\nsome last May eve, and sitting out in the playground till sunset,\r\nwatching the fires begin to twinkle on Cronck-Irey and Barrule for miles\r\naway?  What a jolly talk we had that evening about the holidays; but my\r\nfather and mother were here then, you know, and we were all going to\r\nFairholm.  But the third sign--the first primrose and violet--was always\r\nthe happiest, as well as quite the earliest.  You can\'t think how I\r\n_grabbed_ at the first primrose this year; I found it by a cave on the\r\nNess.  And though these are rather the last than the first, yet I knew\r\nyou\'d like them, Eddy, so I hunted for them everywhere.  And how much\r\nbetter you\'re looking too; such shining eyes, and, yes I positively\r\ndeclare, quite a ruddy cheek like your old one.  You\'ll soon be out\r\namong us again, that\'s clear--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly: he had been rattling on just in the merry way that\r\nRussell now most loved to hear, but, as he was talking, he caught the\r\ntouch of sadness on Russell\'s face, and saw his long, abstracted, eager\r\nlook at the flowers.\r\n\r\n"Dear fellow, you\'re not worse, are you?" he said quickly.  "What a fool\r\nI am to chatter so; it makes you ill."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Eric, talk on; you can\'t think how I love to hear you.  Oh, how\r\nvery beautiful these primroses are!  Thank you for bringing them."  And\r\nhe again fixed on them the eager dreamy look which had startled Eric--as\r\nthough he were learning their colour and shape by heart.\r\n\r\n"I wish I hadn\'t brought them though," said Eric; "they are filling your\r\nmind with regrets.  But, Eddy, you\'ll be well by the holidays--a month\r\nhence, you know--or else I shouldn\'t have talked so gladly about them."\r\n\r\n"No, Eric," said Russell sadly, "these dear flowers are the last spring\r\nblossoms that I shall see--_here_ at least.  Yes, I will keep them, for\r\nyour sake, Eric, till I die."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t talk so," said Eric, shocked and flustered; "why, everybody\r\nknows and says that you\'re getting better."\r\n\r\nRussell smiled and shook his head.  "No, Eric, I shall die.  There stop,\r\ndear fellow, don\'t cry," said he, raising his hands quietly to Eric\'s\r\nface; "isn\'t it better for me so?  I own it seemed sad at first to leave\r\nthis bright world and the sea--yes, even that cruel sea," he continued,\r\nsmiling; "and to leave Roslyn, and Upton, and Monty, and, above all, to\r\nleave _you_, Eric, whom I love best in all the world.  Yes, remember,\r\nI\'ve no home, Eric, and no prospects.  There was nothing to be sorry for\r\nin this, so long as God gave me health and strength; but health went for\r\never into those waves at the Stack, where you saved my life, dear\r\ngallant Eric; and what could I do now?  It doesn\'t look so happy to\r\n_halt_ through life.  O Eric, Eric, I am young, but I am dying--dying,\r\nEric," he said solemnly, "my brother--let me call you brother--I have no\r\nnear relations, you know, to fill up the love in my yearning heart, but\r\nI _do_ love _you_.  I wish you were my brother," he said, as Eric took\r\nhis hand between both his own.  "There, that comforts me; I feel as if I\r\n_were_ a child again, and had a brother; and I _shall_ be a child again\r\nsoon, Eric, in the courts of a Father\'s house."\r\n\r\nEric could not speak.  These words startled him he never dreamt\r\n_recently_ of Russell\'s death, but had begun to reckon on his recovery,\r\nand now life seemed darker to him than ever.\r\n\r\nBut Russell was pressing the flowers to his lips.\r\n\r\n"The grass withereth," he murmured, "the flower fadeth, and the glory of\r\nhis beauty perisheth; but--but the word of the Lord endureth for ever."\r\nAnd here he too burst into natural tears, and Eric pressed his hand,\r\nwith more than a brother\'s fondness, to his heart.\r\n\r\n"O Eddy, Eddy, my heart is full," he said, "too full to speak to you.\r\nLet me read to you," and with his arm round Russell\'s neck, he sat down\r\nbeside his pillow, and read to him about the "pure river of water of\r\nlife, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the\r\nLamb."  At first sobs choked his voice, but it gathered firmness as he\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\n"In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was\r\nthere the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded\r\nher fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing\r\nof the nations.\r\n\r\n"And there shall be no more curse,"--and here the reader\'s musical voice\r\nrose into deeper and steadier sweetness--"but the throne of God and of\r\nthe Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him; and they\r\nshall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads."\r\n\r\n"And they shall see his face," murmured Russell, "_and they shall see\r\nhis face_."  Eric paused and looked at him; a sort of rapture seemed to\r\nbe lighted in his eyes, as though they saw heavenly things, and his\r\ncountenance was like an angel\'s to look upon.  Eric closed the book\r\nreverently, and gazed.\r\n\r\n"And now pray for me, Eric, will you?"  Eric knelt down, but no prayer\r\nwould come; his breast swelled, and his heart beat fast, but emotion\r\nprevented him from uttering a word.  But Russell laid his hand on his\r\nhead and prayed.\r\n\r\n"O gracious Lord God, look down, merciful Father, on us, two erring,\r\nweak, sinful boys; look down and bless us, Lord, for the love Thou\r\nbearest unto Thy children.  One Thou art taking; Lord, take me to the\r\ngreen pastures of Thy home, where no curse is; and one remains--O Lord\r\nbless him with the dew of Thy blessing; lead and guide him, and keep him\r\nfor ever in Thy fear and love, that he may continue Thine for ever, and\r\nhereafter we may meet together among the redeemed, in the immortal glory\r\nof the resurrection.  Hear us, O Father, for Thy dear Son\'s sake.  Amen!\r\nAmen!"\r\n\r\nThe childlike, holy, reverent voice ceased, and Eric rose.  One long\r\nbrotherly kiss he printed on Russell\'s forehead, and, full of sorrowful\r\nforebodings, bade him good-night.\r\n\r\nHe asked Dr Underhay whether his fears were correct.  "Yes," he said,\r\n"he may die at any time; he _must_ die soon.  It is even best that he\r\nshould; besides the loss of a limb, that blow on the head would\r\ncertainly affect the brain and the intellect if he lived."\r\n\r\nEric shuddered--a long cold shudder.\r\n\r\nThe holidays drew on; for Russell\'s sake, and at his earnest wish, Eric\r\nhad worked harder than he ever did before.  All his brilliant abilities,\r\nall his boyish ambition, were called into exercise; and to the delight\r\nof every one, he gained ground rapidly, and seemed likely once more to\r\ndispute the palm with Owen.  No one rejoiced more in this than Mr Rose,\r\nand he often gladdened Russell\'s heart by telling him about it; for\r\nevery day he paid a long visit to the sick boy\'s room, which refreshed\r\nand comforted them both.\r\n\r\nIn other respects too, Eric seemed to be turning over a new leaf.  He\r\nand Upton, by common consent, had laid aside smoking, and every bad\r\nhabit or disobedient custom which would have grieved the dying boy whom\r\nthey both loved so well.  And although Eric\'s popularity, after the\r\nromantic Stack adventure, and his chivalrous daring, was at its very\r\nzenith,--although he had received a medal and flattering letter from the\r\nHumane Society, who had been informed of the transaction by Dr\r\nRowlands,--although his success, both physical and intellectual, was\r\nhigher than ever,--yet the dread of the great loss he was doomed to\r\nsuffer, and the friendship which was to be snapped, overpowered every\r\nother feeling, and his heart was ennobled and purified by contact with\r\nhis suffering friend.\r\n\r\nIt was a June evening, and he and Russell were alone; he had drawn up\r\nthe blind, and through the open window the summer breeze, pure from the\r\nsea and fragrant from the garden, was blowing refreshfully into the sick\r\nboy\'s room.  Russell was very, very happy.  No doubt, no fear assailed\r\nhim all was peace and trustfulness.  Long and earnestly that evening did\r\nhe talk to Eric, and implore him to shun evil ways, striving to lead him\r\ngently to that love of God which was his only support and refuge now.\r\nTearfully and humbly Eric listened, and every now and then the sufferer\r\nstopped to pray aloud.\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Eric," he said, "I am tired, _so_ tired.  I hope we shall\r\nmeet again; I shall give you my desk and all my books, Eric, except a\r\nfew for Horace, Owen, Duncan, and Monty.  And my watch, that dear watch\r\nyour mother, _my_ mother, gave me, I shall leave to Rose as a\r\nremembrance of us both.  Good-night, dear old boy."\r\n\r\nA little before ten that night Eric was again summoned with Upton and\r\nMontagu to Russell\'s bedside.  He was sinking fast; and as he had but a\r\nshort time to live, he expressed a desire to see them, though he could\r\nsee no others.\r\n\r\nThey came, and were amazed to see how bright, how beautiful, the dying\r\nboy looked.  They received his last farewells--he would die that night.\r\nSweetly he blessed them, and made them promise to avoid all evil, and\r\nread the Bible, and pray to God.  But he had only strength to speak at\r\nintervals.  Mr Rose, too, was there; it seemed as though he held the\r\nboy by the hand, as fearlessly now, yea, joyously, he entered the waters\r\nof the dark river.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I should _so_ like to stay with you, Monty, Horace, dear, dear\r\nEric, but God calls me.  I am going--a long way--to my father and\r\nmother--and to the light.  I shall not be a cripple there--nor be in\r\npain."  His words grew slow and difficult.  "God bless you, dear\r\nfellows; God bless you, dear Eric; I am going--to God."\r\n\r\nHe sighed very gently; there was a slight sound in his throat, and he\r\nwas dead.  The gentle, holy, pure spirit of Edwin Russell had passed\r\ninto the presence of its Saviour and its God.  O happy and blameless\r\nboy, no fairer soul has ever stood in the light of the rainbow-circled\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nA terrible scene of boyish anguish followed, as they bent over the\r\nlifeless brow.  But quietly, calmly, Mr Rose checked them, and they\r\nknelt down with streaming eyes while he prayed.\r\n\r\nThey rose a little calmer, and as they turned back again and again to\r\ntake one last fond look at the pale yet placid face, Mr Rose said in a\r\nsolemn tone--\r\n\r\n  "For ever with the Lord,\r\n  Amen so let it be\r\n  Life from the dead is in that word,\r\n  And Immortality."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE, CHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nHOME AGAIN.\r\n\r\n  O far beyond the waters\r\n  The fickle feet may roam,\r\n  But they find no light so pure and bright\r\n  As the one fair star of home;\r\n  The star of tender hearts, lady,\r\n  That glows in an English home.\r\n\r\nThat night, when Eric returned to his dormitory, full of grief, and\r\nweighed down with the sense of desolation and mystery, the other boys\r\nwere silent from sympathy in his sorrow.  Duncan and Llewellyn both knew\r\nand loved Russell themselves, and they were awestruck to hear of his\r\ndeath; they asked some of the particulars, but Eric was not calm enough\r\nto tell them that evening.  The one sense of infinite loss agitated him,\r\nand he indulged his paroxysms of emotion unrestrained, yet silently.\r\nReader, if ever the life has been cut short which you most dearly loved,\r\nif ever you have been made to feel absolutely lonely in the world, then,\r\nand then only, will you appreciate the depth of his affliction.\r\n\r\nBut, like all affliction, it purified and sanctified.  To Eric, as he\r\nrested his aching head on a pillow wet with tears, and vainly sought for\r\nthe sleep whose blessing he had never learned to prize before, how\r\nodious seemed all the vice which he had seen and partaken in since he\r\nbecame an inmate of that little room.  How his soul revolted with\r\ninfinite disgust from the language which he had heard, and the open\r\nglorying in sin of which he had so often been a witness.  The stain and\r\nthe shame of sin fell heavier than ever on his heart; it rode on his\r\nbreast like a nightmare; it haunted his fancy with visions of guilty\r\nmemory, and shapes of horrible regret.  The ghosts of buried misdoings,\r\nwhich he had thought long-lost in the mists of recollection, started up\r\nmenacingly from their forgotten graves, and made him shrink with a sense\r\nof their awful reality.  Behind him, like a wilderness, lay years which\r\nthe locust had eaten; the entrusted hours which had passed away, and\r\nbeen reckoned to him as they passed.\r\n\r\nAnd the thought of Russell mingled with all--Russell, as he fondly\r\nimaged him now, glorified with the glory of heaven, crowned, and in\r\nwhite robes, and with a palm in his hand.  Yes, he had walked and talked\r\nwith one of the Holy Ones.  Had Edwin\'s death quenched his human\r\naffections, and altered his human heart?  If not, might not he be there\r\neven now, leaning over his friend with the beauty of his invisible\r\npresence?  The thought startled him, and seemed to give an awful lustre\r\nto the moonbeam which fell into the room.  No! he could not endure such\r\na presence now, with his weak conscience and corrupted heart; and Eric\r\nhid his head under the clothes, and shut his eyes.\r\n\r\nOnce more the pang of separation entered like iron into his soul.\r\nShould he ever meet Russell again?  What if _he_ had died instead of\r\nEdwin, where would he have been?  "Oh no! no!" he murmured aloud, as the\r\nterrible thought came over him of his own utter unfitness for death, and\r\nthe possibility that he might never never again hear the beloved\r\naccents, or gaze on the cherished countenance of his school friend.\r\n\r\nIn this tumult of accusing thoughts he fell asleep; but that night the\r\ndew of blessing did not fall for him on the fields of sleep.  He was\r\nfrightened by unbidden dreams, in all of which his conscience obtruded\r\non him his sinfulness, and his affection called up the haunting\r\nlineaments of the dear dead face.  He was wandering down a path, at the\r\nend of which Russell stood with beckoning hand inviting him earnestly to\r\njoin him there; he saw his bright ingenuous smile, and heard, as of old,\r\nhis joyous words, and he hastened to meet him; when suddenly the\r\nboy-figure disappeared, and in its place he saw the stern brow, and\r\ngleaming garments, and drawn flaming sword of the Avenger.  And then he\r\nwas in a great wood alone, and wandering, when the well-known voice\r\ncalled his name, and entreated him to turn from that evil place; and he\r\nlonged to turn,--but, whenever he tried, ghostly hands seemed to wave\r\nhim back again, and irresistible cords to drag him into the dark forest,\r\namid the sound of mocking laughs.  Then he was sinking, sinking, sinking\r\ninto a gulf, deep and darker even than the inner darkness of a\r\nsin-desolated heart; sinking, helplessly, hopelessly, everlastingly;\r\nwhile far away, like a star, stood the loved figure in light infinitely\r\nabove him, and with pleading hands implored his deliverance, but could\r\nnot prevail; and Eric was still sinking, sinking infinitely, when the\r\nagony awoke him with a violent start and stifled scream.\r\n\r\nHe could sleep no longer.  Whenever he closed his eyes he saw the pale,\r\ndead, holy features of Edwin, and at last he fancied that he was praying\r\nbeside his corpse, praying to be more like _him_, who lay there so white\r\nand calm; sorrowing beside it, sorrowing that he had so often rejected\r\nhis kind warnings, and pained his affectionate heart.  So Eric began\r\nagain to make good resolutions about all his future life.  Ah! how often\r\nhe had done so before, and how often they had failed.  He had not yet\r\nlearned the lessons which David learned by sad experience: "Then I said,\r\nit is mine own infirmity, _but I will remember the years of the right\r\nhand of the Most High_."\r\n\r\nThat, too, was an eventful night for Montagu.  He had grown of late far\r\nmore thoughtful than before; under Edwin\'s influence he had been laying\r\naside, one by one, the careless sins of school-life, and his tone was\r\nnobler and manlier than it had ever been.  Montagu had never known or\r\nheard much about godliness; his father, a gentleman, a scholar, and a\r\nman of the world, had trained him in the principles of refinement and\r\ngood taste, and given him a high standard of conventional honour; but he\r\npassed through life lightly, and had taught his son to do the same.\r\nPossessed of an ample fortune, which Montagu was to inherit, he troubled\r\nhimself with none of the deep mysteries of life, and:\r\n\r\n  Pampered the coward heart\r\n  With feelings all too delicate for use\r\n  Nursing in some delicious solitude\r\n  His dainty loves and slothful sympathies.\r\n\r\nBut Montagu in Edwin\'s sick-room and by his death-bed; in the terrible\r\nstorm at the Stack, and by contact with Dr Rowlands\'s earnestness, and\r\nMr Rose\'s deep, unaffected, sorrow-mingled piety; by witnessing Eric\'s\r\nfailures and recoveries; and by beginning to take in his course the same\r\nheartfelt interest which Edwin taught him--Montagu, in consequence of\r\nthese things, had begun to see another side of life, which awoke all his\r\ndormant affections and profoundest reasonings.  It seemed as though, for\r\nthe first time, he began to catch some of\r\n\r\n  The still sad music of humanity,\r\n\r\nand to listen with deep eagerness to the strain.  Hitherto, to be well\r\ndressed, handsome, agreeable, rich, and popular, had been to him a\r\nrealised ideal of life; but now he awoke to higher and worthier aims;\r\nand once, when Russell, whose intelligent interest in his work exceeded\r\nthat of any other boy, had pointed out to him that solemn\r\nquestion--[Here appears a three-line Greek quotation] he had entered\r\ninto its meaning with wonderful vividness.  So that, without losing any\r\nof that winning gracefulness of address which made him so great a\r\nfavourite with the school, it became evident to all that he combined\r\nwith it a touching earnestness.  Sometimes when he read the Bible to\r\nEdwin he began to wonder at his past ignorance and selfishness, and\r\nhumbly hope for better things.  All that night of death he had truer\r\ncomfort than Eric--for he cast his cares on God; more calm than Eric--\r\nfor he fixed his hopes on the Son of God; greater strength granted him\r\nthan Eric--because he had learned not to rely upon his own; less fear\r\nand torment than Eric--because he laid the burden of his sins before the\r\ncross, and, as a child, believed in their forgiveness for His sake who\r\ndied thereon.\r\n\r\nThe holidays were approaching.  Eric, to escape as much as possible from\r\nhis sorrow, plunged into the excitement of working for the examination,\r\nand rapidly made up for lost ground.  He now spent most of his time with\r\nthe best of his friends, particularly Montagu, Owen, and Upton; for\r\nUpton, like himself, had been much sobered by sorrow at their loss.\r\nThis time he came out _second_ in his form, and gained more than one\r\nprize.  This was his first glimpse of real delight since Russell\'s\r\ndeath; and when the prize-day came, and he stood with his companions in\r\nthe flower-decorated room, and went up amid universal applause to take\r\nhis prize-books, and receive a few words of compliment from the governor\r\nwho took the chair, he felt almost happy, and keenly entered into the\r\npleasure which his success caused, as well as into the honours won by\r\nhis friends.  One outward sign only remained of his late bereavement--\r\nhis mourning dress.  All the prize-boys wore rosebuds or lilies of the\r\nvalley in their button-holes on the occasion, but on this day Eric would\r\nnot wear them.  Little Wright, who was a great friend of theirs, had\r\nbrought some as a present both to Eric and Montagu, as they stood\r\ntogether on the prize-day morning; they took them with thanks, and, as\r\ntheir eyes met, they understood each other\'s thought.\r\n\r\n"No," said Eric to Wright, "we won\'t wear these to-day, although we have\r\nboth got prizes.  Come along; I know what we will do with them."\r\n\r\nThey all three walked together to the little green quiet churchyard,\r\nwhere, by his own request, Edwin had been buried.  Many a silent visit\r\nhad the friends paid to that grave, on which the turf was now green\r\nagain and the daisies had begun to blossom.  A stone had recently been\r\nplaced to mark the spot, and they read--\r\n\r\nSacred To The Memory of\r\n\r\nEdwin Russell\r\n\r\nAn Orphan Boy\r\n\r\nDied At Roslyn School, May 1847,\r\n\r\nAged Fifteen Years.\r\n\r\n_Is it well with the child?  It is well_.\r\n\r\n                                                         I Kings iv. 26.\r\nThe three boys stood by the grave in silence and sorrow for a time.\r\n\r\n"He would have been the gladdest at our success, Monty," said Eric; "let\r\nus leave the signs of it upon his grave."\r\n\r\nAnd, with reverent hand, scattering over that small mound the choice\r\nrosebuds and fragrant lilies with their green leaves, they turned away\r\nwithout another word.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the great piles of corded boxes which crowded the\r\npassage were put on the coach, and the boys, gladly leaving the deserted\r\nbuilding, drove in every sort of vehicle to the steamer.  What joyous,\r\ntriumphant mornings those were!  How the heart exulted and bounded with\r\nthe sense of life and pleasure, and how universal was the gladness and\r\ngood-humour of every one.  Never were voyages so merry as those of the\r\nsteamer that day, and even the "good-byes" that had to be said at\r\nSouthpool were lightly borne.  From thence the boys quickly scattered to\r\nthe different railways, and the numbers of those who were travelling\r\ntogether got thinner and thinner as the distance increased.  Wright and\r\none or two others went nearly all the way with Eric, and when he got\r\ndown at the little roadside station, from whence started the branch rail\r\nto Ayrton, he bade them a merry and affectionate farewell.  The branch\r\ntrain soon started, and in another hour he would be at Fairholm.\r\n\r\nIt was not till then that his home feelings woke in all their intensity.\r\nHe had not been there for a year.  At Roslyn the summer holidays were\r\nnine weeks, and the holidays at Christmas and Easter were short, so that\r\nit had not been worth while to travel so far as Fairholm, and Eric had\r\nspent his Christmas with friends in another part of the island.  But now\r\nhe was once more to see dear Fairholm, and his aunt, his cousin Fanny,\r\nand above all, his little brother.  His heart was beating fast with joy,\r\nand his eyes sparkling with pleasure and excitement.  As he thrust his\r\nhead out of the window, each well-remembered landmark gave him the\r\ndelicious sensation of meeting again an old friend.  "Ah! there\'s the\r\nwhite bridge, and there\'s the canal, and the stile; and _there_ runs the\r\nriver, and there\'s Velvet Lawn.  Hurrah! here we are."  And springing\r\nout of the train before it had well stopped, he had shaken hands\r\nheartily with the old coachman, who was expecting him, and jumped up\r\ninto the carriage in a moment.\r\n\r\nThrough the lanes he knew so well, by whose hedgerows he had so often\r\nplucked sorrel and wild roses; past the old church with its sleeping\r\nchurchyard; through the quiet village, where every ten yards he met old\r\nacquaintances who looked pleased to see him, and whom he greeted with\r\nglad smiles and nods of recognition; past the Latin-school, from which\r\ncame murmurs and voices as of yore (what a man he felt himself now by\r\ncomparison!)--by the old Roman camp, where he had imagined such heroic\r\nthings when he was a little child; through all the scenes so rich with\r\nthe memories and associations of his happy childhood, they flew along;\r\nand now they had entered the avenue, and Eric was painfully on the\r\nlook-out.\r\n\r\nYes! there they were all three--Mrs Trevor, and Fanny, and Vernon, on\r\nthe mound at the end of the avenue; and the younger ones ran to meet\r\nhim.  It was a joyous meeting; he gave Fanny a hearty kiss, and put his\r\narm round Vernon\'s neck, and then held him in front to have a look at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"How tall you\'ve grown, Verny, and how well you look," he said, gazing\r\nproudly at him; and indeed the boy was a brother to be justly proud of.\r\nAnd Vernon quite returned the admiration as he saw the healthy glow of\r\nEric\'s features, and what a tall strong boy he had grown to be.\r\n\r\nAnd so they quickly joined Mrs Trevor, who embraced her nephew with a\r\nmother\'s love; and, amid all that nameless questioning of delightful\r\ntrifles, that "blossoming vein" of household talk, which gives such an\r\nincommunicable charm to the revisiting of home, they all three turned\r\ninto the house, where Eric, hungry with his travels, enjoyed at leisure\r\nthe "jolly spread" prepared for him, luxurious beyond anything he had\r\nseen for his last year at school.  When he and Vernon went up to their\r\nroom at night--the same little room in which they slept on the night\r\nwhen they first had met--they marked their heights on the door again,\r\nwhich showed Eric that in the last year he had grown two inches, a fact\r\nwhich he pointed out to Vernon with no little exultation.  And then they\r\nwent to bed, and to a sleep over which brooded the indefinite sensation\r\nof a great unknown joy;--that rare heavenly sleep which only comes once\r\nor twice or thrice in life, on occasions such as this.\r\n\r\nHe was up early next morning, and, opening his window, leaned out with\r\nhis hands among the green vine-leaves which encircled it.  The garden\r\nlooked beautiful as ever, and he promised himself an early enjoyment of\r\nthose currants which hung in ruby clusters over the walls.  Everything\r\nwas bathed in the dewy balm of summer morning, and he felt very happy\r\nas, with his little spaniel frisking round him, he visited the great\r\nNewfoundland in his kennel, and his old pet the pony in the stable.  He\r\nhad barely finished his rounds when breakfast was ready, and he once\r\nmore met the home circle from which he had been separated for a year.\r\nAnd yet over all his happiness hung a sense of change and half\r\nmelancholy; they were not changed, but _he_ was changed.\r\n\r\nMrs Trevor, and Fanny, and Vernon were the same as ever, but over _him_\r\nhad come an alteration of feeling and circumstance; an unknown or\r\nhalf-known _something_ which cast a shadow between them and him, and\r\nsometimes made him half shrink and start as he met their loving looks.\r\nCan no schoolboy, who reads his history, understand and explain the\r\nfeeling which I mean?\r\n\r\nBy that mail he wrote to his father and mother an account of Russell\'s\r\ndeath, and he felt that they would guess why the letter was so blurred.\r\n"But," he wrote, "I have some friends still; especially Mr Rose among\r\nthe masters, and Monty and Upton among the boys.  Monty you know; he is\r\nmore like Edwin than any other boy, and I like him very much.  You\r\ndidn\'t know Upton, but I am a great deal with him, though he is much\r\nolder than I am.  He is a fine handsome fellow, and one of the most\r\npopular in the school.  I hope you will know him some day."\r\n\r\nThe very next morning Eric received a letter which he at once recognised\r\nto be in Upton\'s handwriting.  He eagerly tore off the envelope, and\r\nread--\r\n\r\n  "My Dearest Eric--I have got bad news to tell you, at least I feel it\r\n  to be bad news for me, and I flatter myself that you will feel it to\r\n  be bad news for you.  In short, I am going to leave Roslyn, and\r\n  probably we shall never meet there again.  The reason is, I have had a\r\n  cadetship given me, and I am to sail for India in September.  I have\r\n  already written to the school to tell them to pack up and send me all\r\n  my books and clothes.\r\n\r\n  "I feel leaving very much; it has made me quite miserable.  I wanted\r\n  to stay at school another year at least; and I will honestly tell you,\r\n  Eric, one reason; I\'m very much afraid that I\'ve done you, and Graham,\r\n  and other fellows no good; and I wanted, if I possibly could, to undo\r\n  the harm I had done.  Poor Edwin\'s death opened my eyes to a good many\r\n  things, and now I\'d give all I have never to have taught or encouraged\r\n  you in wrong things.  Unluckily it\'s too late;--only, I hope that you\r\n  already see, as I do, that the things I mean lead to evil far greater\r\n  than we ever used to dream of.\r\n\r\n  "Good-bye now, old fellow!  Do write to me soon, and forgive me, and\r\n  believe me ever--Your most affectionate, Horace Upton.\r\n\r\n  "P.S.--Is that jolly little Vernon going back to school with you this\r\n  time?  I remember seeing him running about the shore with my poor\r\n  cousin when you were a home-boarder, and thinking what a nice little\r\n  chap he looked.  I hope you\'ll look after him as a brother should, and\r\n  keep him out of mischief."\r\n\r\nEric folded the letter sadly, and put it into his pocket; he didn\'t\r\noften show them his school letters, because, like this one, they often\r\ncontained allusions to things which he did not like his aunt to know.\r\nThe thought of Upton\'s leaving made him quite unhappy, and he wrote him\r\na long letter by that post, indignantly denying the supposition that his\r\nfriendship had ever done him anything but good.\r\n\r\nThe postscript about Vernon suggested a thought that had been often in\r\nhis mind.  He could not but shudder in himself, when he thought of that\r\nbright little brother of his being initiated in the mysteries of evil\r\nwhich he himself had learnt, and sinking like himself into slow\r\ndegeneracy of heart and life.  It often puzzled and perplexed him, and\r\nat last he determined to open his heart, partially at least, in a letter\r\nto Mr Rose.  The master fully understood his doubts, and wrote him the\r\nfollowing reply--\r\n\r\n  "My Dear Eric--I have just received your letter about your brother\r\n  Vernon, and I think that it does you honour.  I will briefly give you\r\n  my own opinion.\r\n\r\n  "You mean, no doubt, that, from your own experience, you fear that\r\n  Vernon will hear at school many things which will shock his modesty,\r\n  and much language which is evil and blasphemous; you fear that he will\r\n  meet with many bad examples, and learn to look on God and godliness in\r\n  a way far different from that to which he has been accustomed at home.\r\n  You fear, in short, that he must pass through the same painful\r\n  temptations to which you have yourself been subjected; to which,\r\n  perhaps, you have even succumbed.\r\n\r\n  "Well, Eric, this is all true.  Yet, knowing this, I say, by all means\r\n  let Vernon come to Roslyn.  The innocence of mere ignorance is a poor\r\n  thing; it _cannot_, under any circumstances, be permanent, nor is it\r\n  at all valuable as a foundation of character.  The true preparation\r\n  for life, the true basis of a manly character, is not to have been\r\n  ignorant of evil, but to have known it and avoided it; not to have\r\n  been sheltered from temptation, but to have passed through it and\r\n  overcome it by God\'s help.  Many have drawn exaggerated pictures of\r\n  the lowness of public school morality; the best answer is to point to\r\n  the good and splendid men that have been trained in public schools,\r\n  and who lose no opportunity of recurring to them with affection.  It\r\n  is quite possible to be _in_ the little world of school-life, and yet\r\n  not _of_ it.  The ruin of human souls can never be achieved by enemies\r\n  from without unless they be aided by traitors from within.  Remember\r\n  our lost friend; the peculiar lustre of his piety was caused by the\r\n  circumstances, under which he was placed.  He often told me before his\r\n  last hour, that he rejoiced to have been at Roslyn; that he had\r\n  experienced there much real happiness, and derived in every way\r\n  lasting good.\r\n\r\n  "I hope you have been enjoying your holidays, and that you will come\r\n  back with the `spell of home affection\' alive in your heart.  I shall\r\n  rejoice to make Vernon\'s acquaintance, and will do for him all I can.\r\n  Bring him with you to me in the library as soon as you arrive.--Ever,\r\n  dear Eric,\r\n\r\n  "Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n  "Walter Rose."\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nARDIEL.\r\n\r\nPhtheirousin ethe chresth\' omiliai kakai.--_Menander_.\r\n\r\nA year had passed since the events narrated in the last chapter, and had\r\nbrought with it many changes.\r\n\r\nTo Eric the changes were not for good.\r\n\r\nThe memories of Russell were getting dim; the resolutions made during\r\nhis friend\'s illness had vanished; the bad habits laid aside after his\r\ndeath had been resumed.  All this took place very gradually; there were\r\nmany inward struggles, much occasional remorse, but the struggles by\r\ndegrees grew weaker, and remorse lost its sting, and Eric Williams soon\r\nlearned again to follow the multitude to do evil.\r\n\r\nHe was now sixteen years old, and high in the fifth-form, and, besides\r\nthis, he was captain of the school eleven.  In work he had fallen off,\r\nand no one now expected the fulfilment of that promise of genius which\r\nhe had given them when he first came.  But in all school sports he had\r\nimproved, and was the acknowledged leader and champion in matters\r\nrequiring boldness and courage; his popularity made him giddy; favour of\r\nman led to forgetfulness of God; and even a glance at his countenance\r\nshowed a self-sufficiency and arrogance which ill became the refinement\r\nof his features, and ill replaced the ingenuous modesty of former days.\r\n\r\nAnd Vernon Williams was no longer a new boy.  The worst had happened to\r\nhim, which Eric in his better moments could have feared.  He had fallen\r\ninto thoroughly bad hands, and Eric, who should have been his natural\r\nguardian and guide, began to treat him with indifference, and scarcely\r\never had any affectionate intercourse with him.  It is by no means\r\nunfrequent that brothers at school see but little of each other, and\r\nfollow their several pursuits, and choose their various companions, with\r\nsmall regard to the relationship between them.\r\n\r\nYet Eric could not overlook or be blind to the fact, that Vernon\'s chief\r\nfriend or leader was the most undesirable whom he could have chosen.  It\r\nwas a new boy named Brigson.  This boy had been expelled from one of the\r\nmost ill-managed schools in Ireland, although, of course, the fact had\r\nbeen treacherously concealed from the authorities at Roslyn; and now he\r\nwas let loose, without warning or caution, among the Roslyn boys.\r\nBetter for them if their gates had been open to the pestilence! the\r\npestilence could but have killed the body, but this boy--this fore-front\r\nfighter in the devil\'s battle--did much to ruin many an immortal soul.\r\nHe systematically, from the very first, called evil good, and good evil,\r\nput bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.  He openly threw aside the\r\nadmission of any one moral obligation.  Never did some of the Roslyn\r\nboys, to their dying day, forget the deep, intolerable, unfathomable\r\nflood of moral turpitude and iniquity which he bore with him; a flood,\r\nwhich seemed so irresistible, that the influence of such boys as Montagu\r\nand Owen to stay its onrush seemed as futile as the weight of a feather\r\nto bar the fury of a mountain stream.  Eric might have done much, Duncan\r\nmight have done much, to aid the better cause had they tried; but they\r\nresisted at first but faintly, and then not at all, until they too were\r\nswept away in the broadening tide of degeneracy and sin.\r\n\r\nBig, burly, and strong, though much younger than he looked (if he stated\r\nhis age correctly, which I doubt), Brigson, being low in the school,\r\nnaturally became the bully and the leader of all the lower forms--the\r\nbully if they opposed him, the leader if they accepted his guidance.  A\r\nlittle army of small boys attended him, and were ever ready for the\r\nschemes of mischief to which he deliberately trained them, until they\r\ngrew almost as turbulent, as disobedient, and as wicked as himself.  He\r\ntaught both by precept and example, that towards masters neither honour\r\nwas to be recognised, nor respect to be considered due.  To cheat them,\r\nto lie to them, to annoy them in every possible way--to misrepresent\r\ntheir motives, mimic their defects, and calumniate their actions--was\r\nthe conduct which he inaugurated towards them; and for the time that he\r\ncontinued at Roslyn the whole lower-school was a Pandemonium of evil\r\npassions and despicable habits.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the little boys became more or less amenable to his\r\ninfluence, and among them Vernon Williams.  Had Eric done his duty, this\r\nwould never have been; but he was half ashamed to be often with his\r\nbrother, and disliked to find him so often creeping to his side.  He\r\nflattered himself that in this feeling he was only anxious that Vernon\r\nshould grow spirited and independent; but, had he examined himself, he\r\nwould have found selfishness at the bottom of it.  Once or twice his\r\nmanner showed harshness to Vernon, and his young brother both observed\r\nand resented it.  Montagu and others noticed him for Eric\'s sake; but,\r\nbeing in the same form with Brigson, Vernon was thrown much with him,\r\nand feeling, as he did, deserted and lonely, he was easily caught by the\r\nascendency of his physical strength and reckless daring.  Before three\r\nmonths were over, he became, to Eric\'s intolerable disgust, a ringleader\r\nin the band of troublesome scapegraces, whose increasing numbers were\r\nthe despair of all who had the interest of the school at heart.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Owen was now head of the school, and from his\r\nconstitutional want of geniality, he was so little of a boy that he had\r\nno sympathy with the others, and little authority over them.  He simply\r\nkept aloof, holding his own way, and retiring into his own tastes and\r\npursuits, and the society of one or two congenial spirits in the school,\r\nso as in no way to come in contact with the spreading corruption.\r\n\r\nMontagu, now Owen\'s chief friend, was also in the sixth, and fearlessly\r\nexpressed at once his contempt for Brigson, and his dread of the evil he\r\nwas effecting.  Had the monitorial system existed, that contagion could\r\nhave been effectually checked; but, as it was, brute force had unlimited\r\nauthority.  Ill indeed are those informed who raise a cry, and join in\r\nthe ignorant abuse of that noble safeguard of English schools.  Any who\r\nhave had personal and intimate experience of how schools work _with_ it\r\nand _without_ it, know what a Palladium it is of happiness and morality;\r\nhow it prevents bullying, upholds manliness, is the bulwark of\r\ndiscipline, and makes boys more earnest and thoughtful, often at the\r\nmost critical periods of their lives, by enlisting all their sympathies\r\nand interests on the side of the honourable and the just.\r\n\r\nBrigson knew at a glance whom he had most to fear; Ball, Attlay,\r\nLlewellyn, Graham, all tolerated or even approved of him.  Owen did not\r\ncome in his way, so he left him unmolested.  To Eric and Duncan he was\r\nscrupulously civil, and by flattery and deference managed to keep\r\napparently on excellent terms with them.  Eric pretended to be ignorant\r\nof the harm he was bringing about, and in answer to the indignant and\r\nmeasureless invectives of Montagu and others, professed to see in\r\nBrigson a very good fellow.\r\n\r\nBrigson hated Montagu, because he read on his features the unvarying\r\nglance of undisguised contempt.  He dared not come across him openly,\r\nsince Montagu was so high in the school; and besides, though much the\r\nbigger of the two, Brigson was decidedly afraid of him.  But he chose\r\nsly methods of perpetual annoyance.  He nicknamed him "Rosebud," he\r\ntalked at him whenever he had an opportunity; he poisoned the minds of\r\nthe gang of youngsters against him; he spread malicious reports about\r\nhim; he diminished his popularity, and embittered his feelings, by every\r\nsecret and underhand means which lay in his power.\r\n\r\nOne method of torment was most successful.  As a study-boy, Montagu did\r\nnot come to bed till an hour later than the lower part of the school,\r\nand Brigson taught some of the little fellows to play all kinds of\r\ntricks to his bed and room, so that when he came down, it was with the\r\ncertainty of finding everything in confusion.  Sometimes his bed would\r\nbe turned right on end, and he would have to put it to the ground and\r\nremake it before he could lie down.  Sometimes all the furniture in the\r\nroom would be thrown about in different corners, with no trace of the\r\noffender.  Sometimes he would find all sorts of things put inside the\r\nbed itself.  The intolerable part of the vexation was, to be certain\r\nthat this was done at Brigson\'s instigation, or by his own hand, without\r\nhaving the means of convicting or preventing him.  Poor Monty grew very\r\nsad at heart, and this perpetual dastardly annoyance weighed the more\r\nheavily on his spirits, from its being of a kind which peculiarly grated\r\non his refined taste, and his natural sense of what was gentlemanly and\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nOne night, coming down, as usual, in melancholy dread, he saw a light\r\nunder the door of his room.  It struck him that he was earlier than\r\nusual, and he walked up quickly and noiselessly.  There they were at it.\r\nThe instant he entered, there was a rush through the opposite door, and\r\nhe felt convinced that one of the retreating figures was Brigson\'s.  In\r\na second he had sprung across the room, so as to prevent the rest from\r\nrunning, and with heaving breast and flashing eyes, glared at the\r\nintruders as they stood there, sheepish and afraid.\r\n\r\n"What!" he said angrily; "so you are the fellows who have had the\r\ncowardice to annoy me thus, night after night, for weeks; you miserable,\r\ndegraded young animals!" and he looked at the four or five who had not\r\nmade their escape.  "What and _you_ among them," he said with a start,\r\nas he caught the eye of Vernon Williams.  "Oh, this is too bad."  His\r\ntone showed the deepest sorrow and vexation, and for a moment he said no\r\nmore.  Instantly Vernon was by him.\r\n\r\n"_Do_ forgive me, _do_ forgive me, Montagu," he said; "I really didn\'t\r\nknow it teased you so much."\r\n\r\nBut Montagu shook him off, and at once recovered himself.  "Wretched\r\nboys! let me see what you have been doing to-night.  Oh, as usual," he\r\nsaid, glancing at the complete disorder which they had been effecting.\r\n"Ha! but what is this?  So Brigson has introduced another vile secret\r\namong you.  Well, he shall rue it!" and he pointed to some small, almost\r\ninvisible flakes of a whitish substance, scattered here and there over\r\nhis pillow.  It was a kind of powder which, if once it touched the skin,\r\ncaused the most violent and painful irritation.\r\n\r\n"By heavens, this is _too_ bad!" he exclaimed, stamping his foot with\r\nanger.  "What have I ever done to you young blackguards, that you should\r\ntreat me thus?  Have I ever been a bully?  Have I ever harmed one of\r\nyou?  And _you_, too, Vernon Williams!"\r\n\r\nThe little boy trembled and looked ashamed under his glance of sorrow\r\nand scorn.\r\n\r\n"Well, I _know_ who has put you up to this; but you shall not escape so.\r\nI shall thrash you every one."\r\n\r\nVery quietly he suited the action to the word, sparing none.  They took\r\nit patiently enough, conscious of richly deserving it; and when it was\r\nover, Vernon said, "Forgive me, Montagu.  I am very sorry, and will\r\nnever do so again."  Montagu, without deigning a reply, motioned them to\r\ngo, and then sat down, full of grief, on his bed.  But the outrage was\r\nnot over for that night, and no sooner had he put out the light than he\r\nbecame painfully aware that several boys were stealing into the room,\r\nand the next moment he felt a bolster fall on his head.  He was out of\r\nbed in an instant, and with a few fierce and indignant blows, had\r\nscattered the crowd of his cowardly assailants, and driven them away.  A\r\nnumber of fellows had set on him in the dark--on _him_ of all others.\r\nOh, what a change must have happened in the school that this should be\r\npossible!  He felt that the contagion of Brigson\'s baseness had spread\r\nfar indeed.\r\n\r\nHe fought like a lion, and several of the conspirators had reason to\r\nrepent their miscalculation in assaulting so spirited an antagonist.\r\nBut this did not content him; his blood was up, and he determined to\r\nattack the evil at its source.  He strode through his discomfited\r\nenemies straight into Brigson\'s room, struck a match, and said,\r\n"Brigson, get out of bed this instant."\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" grunted Brigson, pretending to be only just awake.\r\n\r\n"None of that, you blackguard!  Will you take a thrashing?"\r\n\r\n"No!" roared Brigson, "I should think not."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, take _that_!" he shouted, striking him in the face.\r\n\r\nThe fight that followed was very short.  In a single round Montagu had\r\nutterly thrashed, and stricken to the earth, and forced to beg for\r\nmercy, his cumbrous and brutal opponent.  He seemed to tower above him\r\nwith a magnificent superiority, and there was a self-controlled passion\r\nabout him which gave tremendous energy to every blow.  Brigson was\r\nutterly dashed, confounded, and cowed, and took without a word the\r\nparting kick of contempt which Montagu bestowed on him.\r\n\r\n"There," he said to the fellows, who had thronged in from all the\r\ndormitories at the first hint of a fight, "I, a sixth-form fellow, have\r\ncondescended to thrash that base coward there, whom all you miserable\r\nlower boys have been making an idol and hero of, and from whom you have\r\nbeen so readily learning every sort of blackguardly and debasing trick.\r\nBut let me tell you and your hero, that if any of you dare to annoy or\r\nlift a finger at me again, you shall do it at your peril.  I despise you\r\nall; there is hardly one gentlemanly or honourable fellow left among you\r\nsince that fellow Brigson has come here; yes, I despise you, and you\r\nknow that you deserve it."  And every one of them _did_ shrink before\r\nhis just and fiery rebuke.\r\n\r\nThe scene was not over when the door suddenly opened, and Mr Rose\r\nappeared.  He stood amazed to see Montagu there in his night-shirt, the\r\nboys all round, and Brigson standing over a basin, washing his nose,\r\nwhich was bleeding profusely.\r\n\r\nMontagu instantly stepped up to him.  "You can trust me, sir; may I ask\r\nyou kindly to say nothing of this?  I have been thrashing some one that\r\ndeserved it, and teaching these fellows a lesson."\r\n\r\nMr Rose saw and allowed for his excited manner.  "I can trust you," he\r\nsaid, "Montagu, and shall take no further notice of this irregularity.\r\nAnd now get instantly to your beds."\r\n\r\nBut Montagu, slipping on his clothes, went straight up to the studies,\r\nand called the upper boys together.  He briefly told them what had\r\noccurred, and they rejoiced greatly, binding themselves for the future\r\nto check, if they could, by all fair means, Brigson\'s pernicious\r\ninfluence and abominable example.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late now; the mischief was done.\r\n\r\n"O Eric," said Montagu, "why did you not make a stand against all this\r\nbefore?  Your own brother was one of them."\r\n\r\n"Little wretch.  I\'ll kick him well for it," said Eric.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" said Montagu, "that\'ll do no good.  Try rather to look after\r\nhim a little more."\r\n\r\n"I hope _you_ will forgive him, and try and rescue him."\r\n\r\n"I will do what I can," said Montagu coldly.\r\n\r\nEric sighed, and they parted.\r\n\r\nMontagu had hoped that after this, Eric would at least break off all\r\nopen connection with Brigson; and, indeed, Eric had meant to do so.  But\r\nthat personage kept carefully out of his way until the first burst of\r\nindignation against him had subsided, and after a time began to address\r\nEric as if nothing had happened.  Meanwhile he had completely regained\r\nhis ascendency over the lower part of the school, which was not\r\ndifficult, because they were wincing under Montagu\'s contempt, and\r\nmingled no little dislike with it; a dislike which all are too apt to\r\nfeel towards those whose very presence and moral superiority are a tacit\r\nrebuke of their own failings.  But while Montagu was hated, Eric was at\r\nthe zenith of popular favour, a favour which Brigson ostentatiously\r\nencouraged.  He was openly flattered and caressed, and if ever he got a\r\nlarge score at cricket, it was chalked triumphantly over the walls.  All\r\nthis he was weak enough to enjoy immensely, and it was one of the\r\nreasons why he did not wish to risk his popularity by breaking with\r\nBrigson.  So, after a little constraint and coldness, he began to stand\r\nin much the same relation to him as before.\r\n\r\nThe best disposed of the upper boys disliked all this very much, and the\r\nsixth and fifth forms began to be split up into two main parties--the\r\none headed by Eric, and, to a much less degree, by Duncan, who devoted\r\nthemselves to the games and diversions of the school, and troubled\r\nthemselves comparatively little about anything else; the other headed by\r\nMontagu, who took the lead in intellectual pursuits, and endeavoured, by\r\nevery means in their power, to counteract the pernicious effects of the\r\nspreading immorality.\r\n\r\nAnd so at Roslyn, owing mainly to the wickedness of one depraved boy,\r\nand the weak fear of man which actuated others, all was disunion,\r\nmisery, and deterioration.  The community which had once been peaceful,\r\nhappy, and united, was filled with violent jealousy and heart-burnings;\r\nevery boy\'s hand seemed to be against his neighbour; lying, bad\r\nlanguage, dishonesty, grew fearfully rife, and the few who, like Owen\r\nand Montagu, remained uncontaminated by the general mischief, walked\r\nalone and despondent amid their uncongenial and degraded school-fellows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nWILDNEY.\r\n\r\n  That punishment\'s the best to hear\r\n  That follows soonest on the sin,\r\n  And guilt\'s a game where losers fare\r\n  Better than those who seem to win.\r\n  _Cov.  Patmore_.\r\n\r\nAT the beginning of this quarter, Eric and Duncan had succeeded to one\r\nof the studies, and Owen shared with Montagu the one which adjoined it.\r\n\r\nLatterly the small boys, in the universal spirit of disobedience, had\r\nfrequented the studies a good deal, but it was generally understood that\r\nno study-boy might ask any one to be a regular visitor to his room\r\nwithout the leave of its other occupant.\r\n\r\nSo one evening Duncan said to Eric, "Do you know little Wildney?"\r\n\r\n"You mean that jolly fearless-looking little fellow, with the great\r\nblack eyes, who came at the beginning of the quarter?  No, I don\'t know\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Well he\'s a very nice little fellow; a regular devil."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" said Eric, laughing, "I shall bring out a new\r\nDuncan-dictionary, in which _Kerkokepovuchos_ equals `very nice little\r\nfellow.\'"\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said Duncan; "you know well enough what I mean; I mean he\'s not\r\none of your white-faced, lily-hearted new boys, but has lots of fun in\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Well, what of him?"\r\n\r\n"Have you any objection to my asking him to sit in the study when he\r\nlikes?"\r\n\r\n"Not the least in the world."\r\n\r\n"Very well, I\'ll go and fetch him now.  But wouldn\'t you like to ask\r\nyour brother Vernon to come in too, whenever he\'s inclined?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Eric, "I don\'t care.  He does come every now and then."\r\n\r\nDuncan went to fetch Wildney, and while he was gone, Eric was thinking\r\n_why_ he didn\'t give Vernon the free run of his study.  He would not\r\nadmit to himself the true reason, which was, that he had too much ground\r\nto fear that his example would do his brother no good.\r\n\r\nEric soon learned to like Wildney, who was a very bright, engaging,\r\nspirited boy, with a dash of pleasant impudence about him which took\r\nEric\'s fancy.  He had been one of the most mischievous of the lower\r\nfellows, but, although clever, did little or nothing in school, and was\r\nin the worst repute with the masters.  Until he was "taken up" by Eric,\r\nhe had been a regular little hero among his compeers, because he was\r\ngame for any kind of mischief, and, in the new tone of popular morality,\r\nhis fearless disregard of rules made him the object of general\r\nadmiration.  From this time, however, he was much in the studies, and\r\nunhappily carried with him to those upper regions the temptation to\r\nworse and more injurious follies than had yet penetrated there.\r\n\r\nIt was an ill day for General Wildney when he sent his idolised little\r\nson to Roslyn; it was an ill day for Eric when Duncan first asked the\r\nchild to frequent their study.\r\n\r\nIt was past nine at night, and the lower-school had gone to bed, but\r\nthere was Wildney quietly sitting by the study are, while Duncan was\r\ndoing some Arnold\'s verses for him to be shown up next day.\r\n\r\n"Bother these verses," said Duncan, "I shall have a whiff.  Do you mind,\r\nEric?"\r\n\r\n"No; not at all."\r\n\r\n"Give me a weed too," said Wildney.\r\n\r\n"What! young \'un--you don\'t mean to say you smoke?" asked Eric, in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I, though? let me show you.  Why, a whole lot of us went and\r\nsmoked two or three pipes by Riverbend only yesterday."\r\n\r\n"Phew!" said Eric; "then I suppose I must smoke too to keep you in\r\ncountenance," and he took a cigar.  It was the first time he had touched\r\none since the day at the Stack.  The remembrance made him gloomy and\r\nsilent.  "Tempora mutantur," thought he, "nos et mutamur in illis."\r\n\r\n"Why, how glum you are," said Wildney, patting him on the head.\r\n\r\n"Oh no!" said Eric, shaking off unpleasant memories.  "Look," he\r\ncontinued, pointing out of the window to change the subject, "what a\r\nglorious night it is!  Nothing but stars, stars, stars."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Duncan, yawning, "this smoking makes one very thirsty.  I\r\nwish I\'d some beer."\r\n\r\n"Well, why shouldn\'t we get some?" said Wildney; "it would be very\r\njolly."\r\n\r\n"Get some!  What! at this time of night?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; I\'ll go now, if you like, to Ellan, and be back before ten."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense," said Eric; "it ain\'t worth while."\r\n\r\n"I believe you think I\'m afraid," said Wildney, laughing, and looking at\r\nEric with his dark eyes; "and what\'s more, I believe _you\'re_ afraid."\r\n\r\n"Little whippersnapper!" said Eric, colouring, "as if I was afraid to do\r\nanything you dare do.  I\'ll go with you at once, if you like."\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of?" asked Duncan; "I don\'t care twopence about\r\nthe beer, and I hope you won\'t go."\r\n\r\n"But I will, though," said Eric, a little nettled that Wildney, of all\r\npeople, should think him wanting in pluck.\r\n\r\n"But how will you get out?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, _I\'ll_ show you a dodge there," said Wildney.  "Come along.  Have\r\nyou a dark lantern?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I\'ll get Llewellyn\'s."\r\n\r\n"Come along, then."\r\n\r\nSo the little boy of twelve took the initiative, and, carrying the dark\r\nlantern, initiated the two study-boys of sixteen into a secret which had\r\nlong been known to the lower part of the school.\r\n\r\n"Ibant obscuri dubia sub luce."  He led them quietly down stairs, stole\r\nwith them noiselessly past the library door, and took them to a window\r\nin the passage, where a pane was broken.\r\n\r\n"Could you get through that?" he whispered to Eric, "if we broke away\r\nthe rest of the glass?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know.  But then, there\'s the bar outside."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll manage that.  But will you go and peep through the key-hole of\r\nthe library, and see who\'s there, Duncan?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Duncan bluntly, "no key-holes for me."\r\n\r\n"Hush! then _I_ will," and he glided away, while Eric, as quietly as he\r\ncould, broke away the glass until it was all removed.\r\n\r\n"There\'s only old Stupid," whispered he, irreverently designating an\r\nunder-master named Harley, "and he\'s asleep before the fire.  Now, then,\r\njust lift me up, Eric, will you?"\r\n\r\nEric lifted him, and he removed the nails which fastened the end of the\r\nbar.  They looked secure enough, and were nails an inch long driven into\r\nthe mortar; but they had been successfully loosened, and only wanted a\r\nlittle pull to bring them out.  In one minute Wildney had unfastened and\r\npushed down one end of the bar.  He then got through the broken pane and\r\ndropped down outside.  Eric followed with some little difficulty, for\r\nthe aperture would only just admit his passage; and Duncan, going back\r\nto the study, anxiously awaited their return.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright moonlight night, and the autumn air was pleasant and\r\ncool.  But Eric\'s first thought, as he dropped on to the ground, was one\r\nof shame that he should suffer his new friend, a mere child, so easily\r\nto tempt him into disobedience and sin.  He had hardly thought till then\r\nof what their errand was to be, but now he couldn\'t help so strongly\r\ndisapproving of it, that he was half inclined to turn back.  He did not,\r\nhowever, dare to suggest this, lest Wildney should charge him with\r\ncowardice, and betray it to the rest.  Besides, the adventure had its\r\nown excitement, the stars looked splendid, and the stolen waters were\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\n"I hope we shan\'t be seen crossing the playground," said Wildney.  "My\r\neye, shouldn\'t we catch it!"\r\n\r\nHe was obviously beginning to be afraid; so Eric assumed an air of\r\nnonchalance, and played the part of protector.\r\n\r\n"Here, take my arm," he said; and as Wildney grasped it tight, instead\r\nof feeling angry and ashamed at having been misled by one so much his\r\njunior, Eric felt strongly drawn towards him by community of danger and\r\ninterest.  Reaching Ellan, it suddenly struck him that he did not know\r\nwhere they were going to buy the beer.  He asked Wildney.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I see you\'re not half up to snuff," said Wildney, whose courage had\r\nrisen; "I\'ll show you."\r\n\r\nHe led to a little low public-house, whence tipsy songs were booming,\r\nand tapped at a side door three times.  As they looked in they saw some\r\nsailors boozing in a dirty taproom, and enveloped in tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nThe side door was opened, and a cunning man held up a light to see who\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, Billy," said Wildney confidentially, "all serene; give us two\r\nbottles of beer--on tick, you know."\r\n\r\n"Yessir--d\'reckly," said the man, with a hateful twinkle of the eyes.\r\n"So you\'re out for a spree," he continued, winking in a knowing way.\r\n"Won\'t you walk into the back parlour while I get them?"  And he showed\r\nthem into a dingy horrid room behind the house, stale with smoke, and\r\nbegrimed with dust.\r\n\r\nEric was silent and disgusted, but Wildney seemed quite at home.  The\r\nman soon returned with the beer.  "Wouldn\'t you like a glass of summat\r\nnow, young gen\'leman?" he asked in an insinuating way.\r\n\r\n"No, Billy! don\'t jabber--we must be off.  Here, open the door."\r\n\r\n"Stop, I\'ll pay," said Eric.  "What\'s the damage?"\r\n\r\n"Three shilling, sir," said the man.  "Glad to see a new customer, sir."\r\nHe pocketed the money and showed them out, standing to look after them\r\nwith a malicious leer as they disappeared, and jerking his left thumb\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"Faugh!" said Eric, taking a long breath as they got out again into the\r\nmoonlight, "what a poisonous place!  Good gracious, Charlie, who\r\nintroduced you there?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t think much of going _there_," said Wildney carelessly; "we\r\ngo every week almost."\r\n\r\n"We! who?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Brigson and a lot of us.  We have a club there which we call `the\r\nAnti-muffs,\' and that\'s our smoking-room."\r\n\r\n"And is that horrid beast the landlord?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; he was an old school-servant, and there\'s no harm in him that I\r\nknow of."\r\n\r\nBut Eric only "phewed" again two or three times, and thought of Montagu.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Wildney clutched him by the arm, and pulled him into the deep\r\nshadow of a porch, whispering in a low tone, "Look!"\r\n\r\nUnder a lamp-post directly opposite them, stood Mr Rose.  He had heard\r\nvoices and footsteps a moment before, and, puzzled at their sudden\r\ncessation in the noiseless street, he was looking round.\r\n\r\n"We must run for it," whispered Wildney hastily, as Mr Rose approached\r\nthe porch; and the two boys took to their heels, and scampered away as\r\nhard as they could, Eric helping on Wildney by taking his hand, and\r\nneither of them looking behind.  They heard Mr Rose following them at\r\nfirst, but soon distanced him, and reached a place where two roads met,\r\neither of which would lead to the school.\r\n\r\n"We won\'t go by the road; I know a short cut by the fields.  What fun!"\r\nsaid Wildney, laughing.\r\n\r\n"What an audacious little monkey you are; you know all sorts of dodges,"\r\nsaid Eric.\r\n\r\nThey had no time to talk, but with a speed winged by fear got to the\r\nschool, sprang on the buttress beneath the window, effected their\r\nentrance, and vanished after replacing the bar--Eric to his study, and\r\nWildney to his dormitory.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a go!" said the latter, as they ran up stairs.  "I\'ve smashed\r\none of the beer bottles in getting through the window, and my trousers\r\nare deluged with the stuff."\r\n\r\nThey had hardly separated when Mr Rose\'s step was heard on the stairs.\r\nHe was just returning from a dinner-party, when the sight of two boys\r\nand the sound of their voices startled him in the street, and their\r\nsudden disappearance made him sure that they were Roslyn boys,\r\nparticularly when they began to run.  He strongly suspected that he\r\nrecognised Wildney as one of them, and therefore made straight for his\r\ndormitory, which he entered, just as that worthy had thrust the\r\nbeer-stained trousers under his bed.  Mr Rose walked up quietly to his\r\nbedside, and observed that he was not asleep, and that he still had half\r\nhis clothes on.  He was going away when he saw a little bit of the\r\ntrousers protruding under the mattress, and giving a pull, out they came\r\nwringing wet with the streams of beer.  He could not tell at first what\r\nthis imported, but a fragment of the bottle fell out of the pocket with\r\na crash on the floor, and he then discovered.  Taking no notice of\r\nWildney\'s pretended sleep, he said quietly, "Come to me before breakfast\r\nto-morrow, Wildney," and went down stairs.\r\n\r\nEric came in soon after, and found the little fellow vainly attempting\r\nto appear indifferent as he related to his admiring auditors the night\'s\r\nadventure; being evidently rather proud of the "Eric and I," which he\r\nintroduced every now and then into his story.\r\n\r\n"Has he twigged you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And me?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know; we shall see to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"I hope not," said Eric; "I\'m sorry for you, Charlie."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t be cured, must be endured," said Wildney.\r\n\r\n"Well, good-night! and don\'t lose heart."\r\n\r\nEric went back to Duncan in the study, and they finished the other\r\nbottle of beer between them, though without much enjoyment, because they\r\nwere full of surmises as to the extent of the discovery, and the nature\r\nof the punishment.\r\n\r\nEric went in to tell Montagu of their escapade.\r\n\r\nHe listened very coldly, and said, "Well, Eric, it would serve you right\r\nto be caught.  What business have you to be going out at night at the\r\ninvitation of contemptible small fry, like this little Wildney?"\r\n\r\n"I beg you won\'t speak of any friend of mine in those terms," said Eric,\r\ndrawing up haughtily.\r\n\r\n"I hope you don\'t call a bad little boy like Wildney, who\'d be no credit\r\nto any one, _your_ friend, Eric?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do though.  He\'s one of the pluckiest, finest, most promising\r\nfellows in the lower-school."\r\n\r\n"How I begin to hate that word plucky," said Montagu; "it\'s made the\r\nexcuse here for everything that\'s wrong, base, and unmanly.  It seems to\r\nme it\'s infinitely more `plucky\' just now to do your duty and not be\r\nashamed of it."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve certainly required _that_ kind of pluck to bear you up lately,\r\nMonty," said Owen, looking up from his books.\r\n\r\n"Pluck!" said Montagu scornfully; "you seem to me to think it consists\r\nin lowering yourself down to the level of that odious Brigson, and\r\njoining hand and glove with the dregs of the school."\r\n\r\n"Dregs of the school!  Upon my word, you\'re cool, to speak of any of my\r\nassociates in that way," said Eric, now thoroughly angry.\r\n\r\n"Associates!" retorted Montagu hotly; "pretty associates!  How do you\r\nexpect anything good to go on, when fellows high in the school like you\r\nhave such dealings with the refined honourable Brigson, and the\r\nexemplary intellectual Wildney?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a couple of confounded muffs!" shouted Eric, banging the door\r\nand flinging into his own study again without further reply.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you been a little hard on him, considering the row he\'s in?"\r\nasked Owen.\r\n\r\nMontagu\'s head was resting on his hand as he bent over the table.\r\n"Perhaps I have, indeed.  But who could help it, Owen, in the present\r\nstate of things?  Yes, you\'re right," he said, after a pause; "_this_\r\nwasn\'t the time to speak.  I\'ll go and talk to him again.  But how\r\nutterly changed he is!"\r\n\r\nHe found Eric on the stairs going down to bed with an affectation of\r\nnoise and gaiety.  He ran after him, and said--\r\n\r\n"Forgive me my passion and sarcasm, Williams.  You know I am apt to\r\nexpress myself strongly."  He could not trust himself to say more, but\r\nheld out his hand.\r\n\r\nEric got red, and hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Come, Eric, it isn\'t _wholly_ my fault, is it, that we are not so warm\r\nto each other as we were when--"\r\n\r\n"O Monty, Monty!" said Eric, softened by the allusion; and he warmly\r\ngrasped his friend\'s proffered hand.\r\n\r\n"O Eric!"\r\n\r\nThe two shook hands in silence, and as they left each other they felt\r\nthat while things continued thus their friendship could not last.  It\r\nwas a sad thought for both.\r\n\r\nNext morning Wildney received a severe flogging, but gained great\r\nreputation by not betraying his companion, and refusing to drop the\r\nleast hint as to their means of getting out, or their purpose in\r\nvisiting Ellan.  So the secret of the bar remained undiscovered, and\r\nwhen any boy wanted to get out at night--(unhappily the trick now became\r\ncommon enough)--he had only to break a pane of glass in that particular\r\nwindow, which, as it was in the passage, often remained unmended and\r\nundiscovered for weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter the flogging, Mr Rose said shortly to Eric, "I want to speak to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s heart misgave him as they entered the familiar library.\r\n\r\n"I think I suspect who was Wildney\'s companion."\r\n\r\nEric was silent.\r\n\r\n"I have no proof, and shall not therefore act on vague suspicion; but\r\nthe boy whom I _do_ suspect is one whose course lately has given me the\r\ndeepest pain; one who has violated all the early promise he gave; one\r\nwho seems to be going farther and farther astray, and sacrificing all\r\nmoral principle to the ghost of a fleeting and most despicable\r\npopularity--to the approval of those whom he cannot himself approve."\r\n\r\nEric still silent.\r\n\r\n"Whatever you do _yourself_ Williams,"--(it was the first time for two\r\nyears that Mr Rose had called him "Williams," and he winced a\r\nlittle)--"whatever you do _yourself_ Williams, rests with _you_; but\r\nremember it is a ten-thousandfold heavier and more accursed crime to set\r\nstumbling-blocks in the way of others, and abuse your influence to cause\r\nany of Christ\'s little ones to perish."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t the tempter, however," thought Eric, still silent;--it was the\r\nsilence of pride and unwilling conviction.\r\n\r\n"Well, you seem hardened, and give no sign.  Believe me, Williams, I\r\ngrieve for you, and that bitterly.  My interest in you is no less warm,\r\nthough my affection for you cannot be the same.  You may go."\r\n\r\n"Another friend alienated, and oh, how true a one!  He has not asked me\r\nto see him once this term," thought Eric sadly; but a shout of pleasure\r\ngreeted him directly he joined the football in the playground, and half\r\nconsoled, he hoped Mr Rose had heard it, and understood that it was\r\nmeant for the boy whom he had just been rebuking.  "Well, after all," he\r\nthought, "I have _some_ friends still."\r\n\r\nYes, friends, such as they were!  Except Duncan, hardly one boy whom he\r\nreally respected ever walked with him now.  Even little Wright, one of\r\nthe very few lower boys who had risen superior to Brigson\'s temptations,\r\nseemed to keep clear of him as much as he could: and in absolute\r\nvacuity, he was obliged to associate with fellows like Attlay, and\r\nGraham, and Llewellyn, and Ball.\r\n\r\nEven with Ball!  All Eric\'s repugnance for this boy seemed to have\r\nevaporated; they were often together, and, to all appearance, were sworn\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nEric did not shrink now from such conversation as was pursued unchecked\r\nin his presence by nearly every one; nay, worse, it had lost its horror,\r\nand he was neither afraid nor ashamed to join in it himself.  This\r\nplague-spot had fretted more deeply than any other into the heart of the\r\nschool morality, and the least boys seemed the greatest proficients in\r\nunbaring, without a blush, its hideous ugliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\n"THE JOLLY HERRING."\r\n\r\n  Velut unda supervenit undam.--_Horace_.\r\n\r\n"The Anti-muffs request the honour of Eric Williams\'s company to a\r\nspread they are going to have to-morrow evening at half-past four, in\r\ntheir smoking-room."\r\n\r\nA note to this effect was put into Eric\'s hands with much _empressement_\r\nby after prayers.  He read it when he got into his study, and hardly\r\nknew whether to be pleased or disgusted at it.\r\n\r\nHe tossed it to Duncan, and said, "What shall I do?"\r\n\r\nDuncan turned up his nose, and chucked the note into the fire.\r\n\r\n"I\'d give them that answer, and no other."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Because, Eric," said Duncan, with more seriousness than was usual with\r\nhim, "I can\'t help thinking things have gone too far lately."\r\n\r\n"How do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'m no saint myself, Heaven knows; but I do think that the\r\nfellows are worse now than I have ever known them--far worse.  Your\r\nfriend Brigson reigns supreme out of the studies; he has laid down a law\r\nthat _no work_ is to be done down stairs ever under any pretence, and\r\nit\'s only by getting into one of the studies that good little chaps like\r\nWright can get on at all.  Even in the classrooms there\'s so much row\r\nand confusion that the mere thought of work is ridiculous."\r\n\r\n"Well, there\'s no great harm in a little noise, if that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t all.  The talk of nearly the whole school is getting most\r\nblackguardly; shamelessly so.  Only yesterday Wildney was chatting with\r\nVernon up here (you were out, or Vernon would not have been here) while\r\nI was reading; they didn\'t seem to mind me, and I\'m sure you\'d have been\r\nvexed to the heart if you\'d heard how they talked to each other.  At\r\nlast I couldn\'t stand it any longer, and bouncing up, I boxed both their\r\nears smartly, and kicked them down stairs."\r\n\r\nAs Eric said nothing, Duncan continued, "And I wish it ended in talk,\r\nbut--"\r\n\r\n"But I believe you\'re turning Owenite.  Why, bless me, we\'re only\r\nschoolboys; it\'ll be lots of time to turn saint some other day."\r\n\r\nEric was talking at random, and in the spirit of opposition.  "You don\'t\r\nwant to make the whole school such a muffish set as the Rosebuds, do\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\nThere was something of assumed bravado in Eric\'s whole manner which\r\njarred on Duncan exceedingly.  "Do as you like," he said curtly, and\r\nwent into another study.\r\n\r\nImmediately after came a rap at the door, and in walked Wildney, as he\r\noften did after the rest were gone to bed, merely slipping his trousers\r\nover his night-shirt, and running up to the studies.\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll come to the Anti-muffs, won\'t you?" he said.\r\n\r\n"To that pestilential place again?--not I."\r\n\r\nWildney looked offended.  "Not after we\'ve all asked you?  The fellows\r\nwon\'t half like your refusing."\r\n\r\nHe had touched Eric\'s weak point.\r\n\r\n"Do come," he said, looking up in Eric\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Confound it all," answered Eric, hastily.  "Yes, I\'ve no friends, I\'ll\r\ncome, Charlie.  Anything to please you, boy."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a brick.  Then I shall cut down and tell the fellows.  They\'ll\r\nbe no end glad.  No friends! what bosh! why, all the school like you."\r\nAnd he scampered off, leaving Eric ill at ease.\r\n\r\nDuncan didn\'t re-enter the study that evening.\r\n\r\nThe next day, about half-past four, Eric found himself on the way to\r\nEllan.  As he was starting, Ball caught him up and said--\r\n\r\n"Are you going to the Anti-muffs?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; why? are you going too?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; do you mind our going together?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all."\r\n\r\nIn fact, Eric was very glad of some one--no matter who--to keep him in\r\ncountenance, for he felt considerably more than half ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nThey went to "The Jolly Herring," as the pot-house was called, and\r\npassed through the dingy beery taproom into the back parlour, to which\r\nEric had already been introduced by Wildney.  About a dozen boys were\r\nassembled, and there was a great clapping as the two newcomers entered.\r\nA long table was laid down the room, which was regularly spread for\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n"Now then, Billy; make haste with the goose," called Brigson.  "I vote,\r\nboys, that Eric Williams takes the chair."\r\n\r\n"Hear! hear!" said half a dozen; and Eric, rather against his will,\r\nfound himself ensconced at the end of the table, with Brigson and Ball\r\non either hand.  The villainous low-foreheaded man, whom they called\r\nBilly, soon brought in a tough goose at one end of the table, and some\r\nfowls at the other; and they fell to, doing ample justice to the _dais\r\neise_, while Billy waited on them.  There was immense uproar during the\r\ndinner, every one eating as fast, and talking as loud, as he could.\r\n\r\nThe birds soon vanished, and were succeeded by long roly-poly puddings,\r\nwhich the boys called Goliahs; and they, too, rapidly disappeared.\r\nMeanwhile beer was circling only too plentifully.\r\n\r\n"Now for the dessert, Billy," called several voices; and that worthy\r\nproceeded to put on the table some figs, cakes, oranges, and four black\r\nbottles of wine.  There was a general grab for these dainties, and one\r\nboy shouted, "I say, I\'ve had no wine."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s all gone.  We must get some brandy--it\'s cheaper," said\r\nBrigson; and accordingly some brandy was brought in, which the boys\r\ndiluted with hot water, and soon despatched.\r\n\r\n"Here! before you\'re all done swilling," said Brigson, "I\'ve got a\r\nhealth: `Confound muffs and masters, and success to the antis.\'"\r\n\r\n"And their chairman," suggested Wildney.\r\n\r\n"And their chairman, the best fellow in the school," added Brigson.\r\n\r\nThe health was drunk with due clamour, and Eric (ridiculous and\r\nmeaningless as he thought the toast) got up to thank them.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not going to spout," he said; "but boys must be boys, and there\'s\r\nno harm in a bit of fun, I for one have enjoyed it, and am much obliged\r\nto you for asking me; and now I call for a song."\r\n\r\n"Wildney!  Wildney\'s song," called several.\r\n\r\nWildney had a good voice, and struck up without the least bashfulness--\r\n\r\n  "Come, landlord, fill the flowing bowl\r\n  Until it does run over\r\n  Come, landlord, fill, etc."\r\n\r\n"Now," he said, "join in the chorus!"  The boys, all more or less\r\nexcited, joined in heartily and uproariously--\r\n\r\n  "For to-night we\'ll merry merry be!\r\n  For to-night we\'ll merry merry be!\r\n  For to-night we\'ll merry merry be!\r\n  To-morrow we\'ll be sober!"\r\n\r\nWhile Wildney sang, Eric had time to think.  As he glanced round the\r\nroom at the flushed faces of the boys, some of whom he could not\r\nrecognise in the dusky atmosphere, a qualm of disgust and shame passed\r\nover him.  Several of them were smoking, and, with Ball and Brigson\r\nheading the line on each side of the table, he could not help observing\r\nwhat a bad set they looked.  The remembrance of Russell came back to\r\nhim.  Oh, if Edwin could have known that he was in such company at such\r\na place!  And by the door stood Billy, watching them all like an evil\r\nspirit, with a leer of saturnine malice on his evil face.\r\n\r\nBut the bright little Wildney, unconscious of Eric\'s bitter thoughts,\r\nsang on with overflowing mirth.\r\n\r\nAs Eric looked at him, shining out like a sunbeam among the rest, he\r\nfelt something like blood-guiltiness on his soul, when he felt that he\r\nwas sanctioning the young boy\'s presence in that degraded assemblage.\r\n\r\nWildney meanwhile was just beginning the next verse, when he was\r\ninterrupted by a general cry of "Cave, cave."  In an instant the room\r\nwas in confusion; some one dashed the candles upon the floor, the table\r\nwas overturned with a mighty crash, and plates, glasses, and bottles\r\nrushed on to the ground in shivers.  Nearly every one bolted for the\r\ndoor, which led through the passage into the street; and in their\r\nheadlong flight and selfishness, they stumbled over each other, and\r\nprevented all egress, several being knocked down and bruised in the\r\ncrush.  Others made for the taproom; but, as they opened the door\r\nleading into it, there stood Mr Ready and Mr Gordon! and as it was\r\nimpossible to pass without being seen, they made no further attempt at\r\nescape.  All this was the work of a minute.  Entering the back parlour,\r\nthe two masters quickly took down the names of full half the boys who,\r\nin the suddenness of the surprise, had been unable to make their exit.\r\n\r\nAnd Eric?\r\n\r\nThe instant that the candles were knocked over, he felt Wildney seize\r\nhis hand, and whisper, "This way; all serene;" following, he groped his\r\nway in the dark to the end of the room, where Wildney, shoving aside a\r\ngreen baize curtain, noiselessly opened a door, which at once led them\r\ninto a little garden.  There they both crouched down under a lilac tree\r\nbeside the house, and listened intently.\r\n\r\nThere was no need for this precaution; their door remained unsuspected,\r\nand in five minutes the coast was clear.  Creeping into the house again,\r\nthey whistled, and Billy coming in, told them that the masters had gone,\r\nand all was safe.\r\n\r\n"Glad ye\'re not twigged, gen\'lemen," he said; "but there\'ll be a pretty\r\nsight of damage for all this glass and plates."\r\n\r\n"Shut up with your glass and plates," said Wildney.  "Here, Eric, we\r\nmust cut for it again."\r\n\r\nIt was the dusk of a winter evening when they got out from the close\r\nroom into the open-air, and they had to consider which way they would\r\nchoose to avoid discovery.  They happened to choose the wrong, but\r\nescaped by dint of hard running, and Wildney\'s old short cut.  As they\r\nran they passed several boys (who, having been caught, were walking home\r\nleisurely), and managed to get back undiscovered, when they both\r\nanswered their names quite innocently at the roll-call, immediately\r\nafter lock-up.\r\n\r\n"What lucky dogs you are to get off," said many boys to them.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it\'s precious lucky for me," said Wildney.  "If I\'d been caught at\r\nthis kind of thing a second time, I should have got something worse than\r\na swishing."\r\n\r\n"Well it\'s all through you I escaped," said Eric, "you knowing little\r\nscamp."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of it, Eric," said Wildney, in his fascinating way, "since it\r\nwas all through me you went.  It\'s rather too hazardous though; we must\r\nmanage better another time."\r\n\r\nDuring tea-time Eric was silent, as he felt pretty sure that none of the\r\nsixth-form or other study-boys would particularly sympathise with his\r\nlate associates.  Since the previous evening he had been cool with\r\nDuncan, and the rest had long rather despised him as a boy who\'d do\r\nanything to be popular; so he sat there silent, looking as disdainful as\r\nhe could, and not touching the tea, for which he felt disinclined after\r\nthe recent potations.  But the contemptuous exterior hid a\r\nself-reproving heart, and he felt how far more worthy Owen and Montagu\r\nwere than he.  How gladly would he have changed places with them; how\r\nmuch he would have given to recover some of their forfeited esteem.\r\n\r\nThe master on duty was Mr Rose, and after tea he left the room for a\r\nfew minutes while the tables were cleared for "preparation," and the\r\nboys were getting out their books and exercises.  All the study and\r\nclassroom boys were expected to go away during this interval; but Eric,\r\nnot noticing Mr Rose\'s entrance, sat gossiping with Wildney about the\r\ndinner and its possible consequences to the school.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting on the desk carelessly, with one leg over the other, and\r\nbending down towards Wildney.  He had just told him that he looked like\r\na regular little sunbeam in the smoking-room of "The Jolly Herring," and\r\nWildney was pretending to be immensely offended by the simile.\r\n\r\n"Hush! no more talking," said Mr Rose, who did everything very gently\r\nand quietly.  Eric heard him, but he was inclined to linger, and had\r\nalways received such mild treatment from Mr Rose, that he didn\'t think\r\nhe would take much notice of the delay.  For the moment he did not, so\r\nWildney began to chatter again.\r\n\r\n"All study-boys to leave the room," said Mr Rose.\r\n\r\nEric just glanced round and moved slightly; he might have gone away, but\r\nthat he caught a satirical look in Wildney\'s eye, and besides wanted to\r\nshow off a little indifference to his old master, with whom he had had\r\nno intercourse since their last-mentioned conversation.\r\n\r\n"Williams, go away instantly; what do you mean by staying after I have\r\ndismissed you?" said Mr Rose sternly.\r\n\r\nEvery one knew what a favourite Eric had once been, so this speech\r\ncreated a slight titter.  The boy heard it just as he was going out of\r\nthe room, and it annoyed him, and called to arms all his proud and\r\ndogged obstinacy.  Pretending to have forgotten something, he walked\r\nconceitedly back to Wildney, and whispered to him, "I shan\'t go if he\r\nchooses to speak like that."\r\n\r\nA red flush passed over Mr Rose\'s cheek; he took two strides to Eric,\r\nand laid the cane sharply once across his back.\r\n\r\nEric was not quite himself, or he would not have acted as he had done.\r\nHis potations, though not deep, had, with the exciting events of the\r\nevening, made his head giddy, and the stroke of the cane, which he had\r\nnot felt now for two years, roused him to madness.  He bounded up,\r\nsprang towards Mr Rose, and almost before he knew what he was about,\r\nhad wrenched the cane out of his hands, twisted it violently in the\r\nmiddle until it broke, and flung one of the pieces furiously into the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nFor one instant, boy and master--Eric Williams and Mr Rose--stood\r\nfacing each other amid breathless silence, the boy panting and\r\npassionate, with his brain swimming, and his heart on fire; the master\r\npale, grieved, amazed beyond measure, but perfectly self-collected.\r\n\r\n"After that exhibition," said Mr Rose, with cold and quiet dignity,\r\n"you had better leave the room."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I had," answered Eric bitterly; "there\'s your cane."  And,\r\nflinging the other fragment at Mr Rose\'s head, he strode blindly out of\r\nthe room, sweeping books from the table, and overturning several boys in\r\nhis way.  He then banged the door with all his force, and rushed up into\r\nhis study.\r\n\r\nDuncan was there, and, remarking his wild look and demeanour, asked,\r\nafter a moment\'s awkward silence, "Is anything the matter, Williams?"\r\n\r\n"Williams!" echoed Eric with a scornful laugh; "yes, that\'s always the\r\nway with a fellow when he\'s in trouble.  I always know what\'s coming\r\nwhen you begin to leave off calling me by my Christian name."\r\n\r\n"Very well, then," said Duncan good-humouredly, "what\'s the matter,\r\nEric?"\r\n\r\n"Matter?" answered Eric, pacing up and down the little room with an\r\nangry to-and-fro like a caged wild beast, and kicking everything which\r\ncame in his way; "matter? hang you all, you are all turning against me,\r\nbecause you are a set of muffs, and--"\r\n\r\n"Take care!" said Duncan; but suddenly he caught Eric\'s look, and\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ve been breaking Rose\'s cane over his head, because he had the\r\nimpudence to touch me with it, and--"\r\n\r\n"Eric, you\'re not yourself to-night," said Duncan, interrupting, but\r\nspeaking in the kindest tone; and taking Eric\'s hand, he looked him\r\nsteadily in the face.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met; the boy\'s false self once more slipped off.  By a strong\r\neffort he repressed the rising passion which the fumes of drink had\r\ncaused, and flinging himself on his chair, refused to speak again, or\r\neven to go down stairs when the prayer-bell rang.\r\n\r\nSeeing that in his present mood there was nothing to be done with him,\r\nDuncan, instead of returning to the study, went after prayers into\r\nMontagu\'s, and talked with him over the recent events, of which the\r\nboys\' minds were all full.\r\n\r\nBut Eric sat lonely, sulky, and miserable, in his study, doing nothing,\r\nand when Montagu came in to visit him, felt inclined to resent his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n"So," he said, looking up at the ceiling, "another saint come to cast a\r\nstone at me!  Well!  I suppose I must be resigned," he continued,\r\ndropping his cheek on his hand again; "only don\'t let the sermon be\r\nlong."\r\n\r\nBut Montagu took no notice of his sardonic harshness, and seated himself\r\nby his side, though Eric pettishly pushed him away.\r\n\r\n"Come, Eric," said Montagu, taking the hand which was repelling him; "I\r\nwon\'t be repulsed in this way.  Look at me.  What? won\'t you even look?\r\nO Eric, one wouldn\'t have fancied this in past days, when we were so\r\nmuch together with one who is dead.  It\'s a long long time since we\'ve\r\neven alluded to him, but _I_ shall never forget those happy days."\r\n\r\nEric heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not come to reproach you.  You don\'t give me a friend\'s right to\r\nreprove.  But still, Eric, for your own sake, dear fellow, I can\'t help\r\nbeing sorry for all this.  I did hope you\'d have broken with Brigson\r\nafter the thrashing I gave him for the foul way, in which he treated me.\r\nI don\'t think you _can_ know the mischief he is doing."\r\n\r\nThe large tears began to soften the fire of Eric\'s eye.  "Ah!" he said,\r\n"it\'s all of no use; you\'re all giving me the cold shoulder, and I\'m\r\ngoing to the bad, that\'s the long and short of it."\r\n\r\n"O Eric! for your own sake, for your parents\' sake, for the school\'s\r\nsake, for all your real friends\' sake, don\'t talk in that bitter,\r\nhopeless way.  You are too fine a fellow to be made the tool or the\r\npatron of the boys who lead, while they seem to follow you.  I _do_ hope\r\nyou\'ll join us even yet in resisting them."\r\n\r\nEric had laid his head on the table, which shook with his emotion.  "I\r\ncan\'t talk, Monty," he said, in an altered tone; "but leave me now; and\r\nif you like, we will have a walk to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Most willingly, Eric."  And, again warmly pressing his hand, Montagu\r\nreturned to his own study.\r\n\r\nSoon after, there came a timid knock at Eric\'s door.  He expected\r\nWildney as usual; a little before, he had been looking out for him, and\r\nhoping he would come, but he didn\'t want to see him now, so he answered\r\nrather peevishly, "Come in; but I don\'t want to be bothered to-night."\r\n\r\nNot Wildney, but Vernon appeared at the door.  "May I come in? not if it\r\nbothers you, Eric," he said gently.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Verny, I didn\'t know it was you; I thought it would be Wildney.\r\nYou _never_ come now."\r\n\r\nThe little boy came in, and his pleading look seemed to say, "Whose\r\nfault is that?"\r\n\r\n"Come here, Verny," and Eric drew him towards him, and put him on his\r\nknee, while the tears trembled large and luminous in the child\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time for many a long day that the brothers had been\r\nalone together, the first time for many a long day that any acts of\r\nkindness had passed between them.  Both seemed to remember this, and, at\r\nthe same time, to remember home, and their absent parents, and their\r\nmother\'s prayers, and all the quiet half-forgotten vista of innocent\r\npleasures, and sacred relationships, and holy affections.  And why did\r\nthey see each other so little at school?  Their consciences told them\r\nboth that either wished to conceal from the other his wickedness and\r\nforgetfulness of God.\r\n\r\nThey wept together; and once more, as they had not done since they were\r\nchildren, each brother put his arm round the other\'s neck.  And\r\nremorseful Eric could not help being amazed, how, in his cruel,\r\nheartless selfishness, he had let that fair child go so far far astray;\r\nleft him as a prey to such boys as were his companions in the\r\nlower-school.\r\n\r\n"Eric, did you know I was caught to-night at the dinner?"\r\n\r\n"You!" said Eric, with a start and a deep blush.  "Good heavens!  I\r\ndidn\'t notice you, and should not have dreamt of coming, if I\'d known\r\nyou were there.  Oh, Vernon, forgive me for setting you such a bad\r\nexample."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I was there, and I was caught."\r\n\r\n"Poor boy! but never mind; there are such a lot that you can\'t get much\r\ndone to you."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t _that_ I care for; I\'ve been flogged before, you know.  But--\r\nmay I say something?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Vernon, anything you like."\r\n\r\n"Well, then,--oh, Eric!  I\'m _so so_ sorry that you did that to Mr Rose\r\nto-night.  All the fellows are praising you up, of course; but I could\r\nhave cried to see it, and I did.  I wouldn\'t have minded if it had been\r\nanybody but Rose."\r\n\r\n"But why?"\r\n\r\n"Because, Eric, he\'s been so good, so kind to both of us.  You\'ve often\r\ntold me about him, you know, at Fairholm, and he\'s done such lots of\r\nkind things to me.  And only to-night, when he heard I was caught, he\r\nsent for me to the library, and spoke so firmly, yet so gently, about\r\nthe wickedness of going to such low places, and about so young a boy as\r\nI am learning to drink, and the ruin of it--and--and--" His voice was\r\nchoked by sobs for a time,--"and then he knelt down and prayed for me,\r\nso as I have never heard any one pray but mother; and do you know, Eric,\r\nit was strange, but I thought, I _did_ hear our mother\'s voice praying\r\nfor me too, while he prayed, and--" He tried in vain to go on; but\r\nEric\'s conscience continued for him; "and just as he had ceased doing\r\nthis for one brother, the other brother, for whom he has often done the\r\nsame, treated him with coarseness, violence, and insolence."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am utterly wretched, Verny.  I hate myself.  And to think that\r\nwhile I\'m like this they are yet loving and praising me at home.  And, O\r\nVerny, I was so sorry to hear from Duncan how you were talking the other\r\nday."\r\n\r\nVernon hid his face on Eric\'s shoulder; and as his brother stooped over\r\nhim and folded him to his heart, they cried in silence, for there seemed\r\nno more to say, until, wearied with sorrow, the younger fell asleep and\r\nthen Eric carried him tenderly down stairs, and laid him, still half\r\nsleeping, upon his bed.\r\n\r\nHe laid him down, and looked at him as he slumbered.  The other boys had\r\nnot been disturbed by their noiseless entrance, and he sat down on his\r\nbrother\'s bed to think, shading off the light of the candle with his\r\nhand.  It was rarely now that Eric\'s thoughts were so rich with the\r\nmemories of childhood, and sombre with the consciousness of sin, as they\r\nwere that night, while he gazed on his brother Vernon\'s face.  He did\r\nnot know what made him look so long and earnestly; an indistinct sorrow,\r\nan unconjectured foreboding, passed over his mind, like the shadow of a\r\nsummer cloud.  Vernon was now slumbering deeply; his soft bright hair\r\nfell over his forehead, and his head nestled in the pillow; but there\r\nwas an expression of uneasiness on his sleeping features, and the long\r\neyelashes were still wet with tears.\r\n\r\n"Poor child," thought Eric; "dear little Vernon: and he is to be\r\nflogged, perhaps birched, to-morrow."\r\n\r\nHe went off sadly to bed, and hardly once remembered that _he_ too would\r\ncome in for very severe and certain punishment the next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nMR ROSE AND BRIGSON.\r\n\r\n  Raro antecedentem scelestum\r\n  Deseruit pede Poena claudo.\r\n  _Horace_.\r\n\r\nAfter prayers the next morning Dr Rowlands spoke to his boarders on the\r\nprevious day\'s discovery, and in a few forcible vivid words, set before\r\nthem the enormity of the offence.  He ended by announcing that the boys\r\nwho were caught would be birched,--"except the elder ones, who will\r\nbring me one hundred lines every hour of the half-holidays till further\r\nnotice.  There are some," he said.  "I am well aware, who, though\r\npresent yesterday, were not detected.  I am sorry for it for _their_\r\nsakes; they will be more likely to sin again.  In cases like this,\r\npunishment is a blessing, and impunity a burden."  On leaving the room\r\nhe bade Eric follow him into his study.  Eric obeyed, and stood before\r\nthe head-master with downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n"Williams," he said, "I have had a great regard for you, and felt a deep\r\ninterest in you from the day I first saw you, and knew your excellent\r\nparents.  At one time I had conceived great hopes of your future course,\r\nand your abilities seemed likely to blossom into excellent fruit.  But\r\nyou fell off greatly, and grew idle and careless.  At last an event\r\nhappened, in which for a time you acted worthily of yourself; and which\r\nseemed to arouse you from your negligence and indifference.  All my\r\nhopes in you revived; but as I continued to watch your course (more\r\nclosely perhaps than you supposed), I observed with pain that those\r\nhopes must be again disappointed.  It needs but a glance at your\r\ncountenance to be sure that you are not so upright or right-minded a boy\r\nas you were two years ago.  I can judge only from your outward course;\r\nbut I deeply fear, Williams--I deeply fear, that in _other_ respects\r\nalso you are going the down-hill road.  And what am I to think now,\r\nwhen, on the _same_ morning, you and your little brother _both_ come\r\nbefore me for such serious and heavy faults?  I cannot free you from\r\nblame even for _his_ misdoings, for you are his natural guardian here; I\r\nam only glad that you were not involved with him in that charge."\r\n\r\n"Let _me_ bear the punishment, sir, instead of him," said Eric, by a\r\nsudden impulse; "for I misled him, and was there myself."\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands paced the room in deep sorrow.  "You, Williams! on the\r\nverge of the sixth-form.  Alas!  I fear, from this, that the state of\r\nthings among you is even worse than I had supposed."\r\n\r\nEric again hung his head.\r\n\r\n"No; you have confessed the sin voluntarily, and therefore at present I\r\nshall not notice it; only, let me entreat you to beware.  But I must\r\nturn to the other matter.  What excuse have you for your intolerable\r\nconduct to Mr Rose, who, as I know, has shown you from the first the\r\nmost unusual and disinterested kindness?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot defend myself, sir.  I was excited, and could not control my\r\npassion."\r\n\r\n"Then you must sit down here, and write an apology, which I shall make\r\nyou read aloud before the whole school at twelve to-day."\r\n\r\nEric, with trembling hand, wrote his apology, and Dr Rowlands glanced\r\nat it.  "That will do," he said; "I am glad you take a right view of the\r\nmatter.  Come to me again at twelve."\r\n\r\nAt twelve all the school were assembled, and Eric, pale and miserable,\r\nfollowed the Doctor into the great schoolroom.  The masters stood at one\r\nend of the room, and among them Mr Rose, who, however, appeared an\r\nindifferent and uninterested spectator of the transaction.  Every glance\r\nwas fixed on Eric, and every one pitied him.\r\n\r\n"We are assembled," said Dr Rowlands, "for an act of justice.  One of\r\nyour number has insulted a master publicly, and is ashamed of his\r\nconduct, and has himself written the apology which he will read.  I had\r\nintended to add a still severer punishment, but Mr Rose has earnestly\r\nbegged me not to do so, and I have succumbed to his wishes.  Williams,\r\nread your apology."\r\n\r\nThere was a dead hush, and Eric tried once or twice in vain to utter a\r\nword.  At last, by a spasmodic effort, he regained his voice, and read,\r\nbut in so low and nervous a tone, that not even those nearest him heard\r\nwhat he was saying.\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands took the paper from him.  "Owing," he said, "to a very\r\nnatural and pardonable emotion, the apology has been read in such a way\r\nthat you could not have understood it.  I will therefore read it myself.\r\nIt is to this effect--`I, Eric Williams, beg humbly and sincerely to\r\napologise for my passionate and ungrateful insult to Mr Rose.\'"\r\n\r\n"You will understand that he was left quite free to choose his own\r\nexpressions; and as he has acknowledged his shame and compunction for\r\nthe act, I trust that none of you will be tempted to elevate him into a\r\nhero, for a folly which he himself so much regrets.  This affair--as I\r\nshould wish all bad deeds to be after they have once been punished--will\r\nnow be forgiven, and I hope forgotten."\r\n\r\nThey left the room and dispersed, and Eric fancied that all shunned and\r\nlooked coldly on his degradation.  But not so: Montagu came, and taking\r\nhis arm in the old friendly way, went a walk with him.  It was a\r\nconstrained and silent walk, and they were both glad when it was over,\r\nalthough Montagu did all he could to show that he loved Eric no less\r\nthan before.  Still it was weeks since they had been much together, and\r\nthey had far fewer things in common now than they used to have before.\r\nEric\'s sprightliness, once the delight of all his friends, was now\r\nrarely exhibited, except in the company of Wildney and Graham.\r\n\r\n"I\'m so wretched, Monty," said Eric at last; "do you think Rose despises\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"I am _sure_ of the contrary.  Won\'t you go to him, Eric, and say all\r\nyou feel?"\r\n\r\n"Heigh ho!  I shall never get right again.  Oh, to recover the last two\r\nyears!"\r\n\r\n"You can redeem them, Eric, by a wiser present.  Let the same words\r\ncomfort you that have often brought hope to me--`I will restore the\r\nyears which the locust hath eaten.\'"\r\n\r\nThey reached the school-door, and Eric went straight to the library.\r\nMr Rose was there alone.  He received him kindly, as usual, and Eric\r\nwent up to the fireplace where he was standing.  They had often stood by\r\nthat library fire on far different terms.\r\n\r\n"Forgive me, sir," was all Eric could say, as the tears rushed to his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n"Freely, my boy," said Mr Rose sadly.  "I wish you could feel how fully\r\nI forgive you; but," he added, laying his hand for the last time on\r\nEric\'s head, "you have far more, Eric, to forgive yourself.  I will not\r\ntalk to you, Eric; it would be little good, I fear; but you little know\r\nhow much I pity and tremble for you."\r\n\r\nWhile these scenes were being enacted with Eric, a large group was\r\ncollected round the fireplace in the boarders\' room, and many tongues\r\nwere loudly discussing the recent events.\r\n\r\nAlas for gratitude!  There was not a boy in that group to whom Mr Rose\r\nhad not done many an act of kindness; and to most of them far more than\r\nthey ever knew.  Many a weary hour had he toiled for them in private,\r\nwhen his weak frame was harassed by suffering; many a sleepless night\r\nhad he wrestled for them in prayer, when, for their sakes, his own many\r\ntroubles were laid aside.  Work on, Walter Rose, and He who seeth in\r\nsecret will reward you openly! but expect no gratitude from those for\r\nwhose salvation you, like the great tender-hearted apostle, would almost\r\nbe ready to wish yourself accursed.\r\n\r\nNearly every one in that noisy group was abusing Mr Rose.  It had long\r\nbeen Brigson\'s cue to do so; he derided him on every opportunity, and\r\ndelighted to represent him as hypocritical and insincere.  Even his weak\r\nhealth was the subject of Brigson\'s coarse ridicule, and the bad boy\r\npaid in deep hatred the natural tribute which vice must ever accord to\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n"You see how he turns on his pets if they offend him," said Brigson;\r\n"why, even that old beast Gordon isn\'t as bad."\r\n\r\n"Yes; while poor Eric was reading, Rose reminded me of Milton\'s\r\nserpent," observed Ball sententiously--\r\n\r\n  "Hope elevates, and joy\r\n  Brightens his crest."\r\n\r\n"He-e-ar! he-e-ar!" said Pietrie; "_vide_ the last fifth-form\r\nRepetition."\r\n\r\n"I expect Eric won\'t see everything so much _couleur de rose_ now, as\r\nthe French frog hath it," remarked Graham.\r\n\r\n"Turn him out for his bad pun," said Wildney.\r\n\r\n"That means you\'re jealous of it, old fellow," answered Graham.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say either you or he _rose_ in my estimation in consequence,"\r\nsaid Wildney, chuckling, as he dodged away to escape Graham\'s pursuit.\r\n\r\n"It was too bad to stand by and triumph, certainly," observed Llewellyn.\r\n\r\n"I say, you fellows," remonstrated the sober little Wright, who, with\r\nVernon, was sitting reading a book at one of the desks, "all that isn\'t\r\nfair.  I\'m sure you all saw how really sorry Rose looked about it; and\r\nhe said, you know, that it was merely for the sake of school discipline\r\nthat he put the matter in Rowlands\'s hands."\r\n\r\n"Discipline be hanged," shouted Brigson; "we\'ll have our revenge on him\r\nyet, discipline or no."\r\n\r\n"I hope you won\'t though," said Vernon; "I know Eric will be sorry if\r\nyou do."\r\n\r\n"The more muff he.  We shall do as we like."\r\n\r\n"Well, I shall tell him; and I\'m sure he\'ll ask you not.  You know how\r\noften he tries to stick up for Rose."\r\n\r\n"If you say a word more," said Brigson, unaccustomed to being opposed\r\namong his knot of courtiers, "I\'ll kick you out of the room; you and\r\nthat wretched little fool there with you."\r\n\r\n"You may do as you like," answered Wright quietly; "but you won\'t go on\r\nlike this long, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nBrigson tried to seize him, but failing, contented himself with flinging\r\na big coal at him as he ran out of the room, which narrowly missed his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"I have it," said Brigson; "that little donkey\'s given me an idea.\r\nWe\'ll _crust_ Rose to-night."\r\n\r\n"To crust," gentle reader, means to pelt an obnoxious person with\r\ncrusts.\r\n\r\n"Capital," said some of the worst boys present, "we will."\r\n\r\n"Well, who\'ll take part?"\r\n\r\nNo one offered.  "What! are we all turning sneaks and cowards?  Here,\r\nWildney, won\'t you? you were abusing Rose just now."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I will," said Wildney, but with no great alacrity.  "You\'ll not\r\nhave done till you\'ve got us all expelled, I believe."\r\n\r\n"Fiddlestick-end! and what if we are? besides, he can\'t expel half the\r\nschool."\r\n\r\nFirst two or three more offered, and then a whole lot, gaining courage\r\nby numbers.  So the plot was regularly laid.  Pietrie and Graham were to\r\nput out the lights at each end of one table immediately after tea, and\r\nWildney and Booking at the other, when the study fellows had gone out.\r\nThere would then be only Mr Rose\'s candle burning, and the two middle\r\ncandles, which in so large a room would just give enough light for their\r\npurpose.  Then all the conspirators were to throng around the door, and\r\nfrom it aim their crusts at Mr Rose\'s head.  Not nearly so many would\r\nhave volunteered to join, but that they fancied Mr Rose was too gentle\r\nto take up the matter with vigour, and they were encouraged in their\r\nproject by his quiet leniency towards Eric the night before.  It was\r\nagreed that no study-boy should be told of the intention, lest any of\r\nthem should interfere.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of many beat fast at tea that night as they observed that\r\nnumbers of boys, instead of eating all their bread, were cutting off the\r\ncrusts, and breaking them into good-sized bits.\r\n\r\nTea finished, Mr Rose said grace, and then sat down quietly reading in\r\nhis desk.  The signal agreed on was the (accidental) dropping of a plate\r\nby Brigson.  The study-boys left the room.\r\n\r\nCrash!--down fell a plate on the floor, breaking to pieces in the fall.\r\n\r\nInstantly the four candles went out, and there was a hurried movement\r\ntowards the door, and a murmur of voices.\r\n\r\n"Now then," said Brigson, in a loud whisper; "what a wretched set you\r\nare!  Here goes!"\r\n\r\nThe master, surprised at the sudden gloom and confusion, had just looked\r\nup, unable to conjecture what was the matter.  Brigson\'s crust caught\r\nhim a sharp rap on the forehead as he moved.\r\n\r\nIn an instant he started up, and ten or twelve more crusts flew by or\r\nhit him on the head as he strode out of the desk towards the door.\r\nDirectly he stirred, there was a rush of boys into the passage, and if\r\nhe had once lost his judgment or temper, worse harm might have followed.\r\nBut he did not.  Going to the door, he said, "Preparation will be in\r\nfive minutes; every boy not then in his place will be punished."\r\n\r\nDuring that five minutes the servants had cleared away the tea, full of\r\nwonder; but Mr Rose paced up and down the room, taking no notice of any\r\none.  Immediately after, all the boys were in their places, with their\r\nbooks open before them, and in the thrilling silence you might have\r\nheard a pin drop.  Every one felt that Mr Rose was master of the\r\noccasion, and awaited his next step in terrified suspense.\r\n\r\nThey all perceived how thoroughly they had mistaken their subject.  The\r\nringleaders would have given all they had to be well out of the scrape.\r\nMr Rose ruled by kindness, but he never suffered his will to be\r\ndisputed for an instant.  He governed with such consummate tact, that\r\nthey hardly felt it to be government at all, and hence arose their\r\nstupid miscalculation.  But he felt that the time was now come to assert\r\nhis paramount authority, and determined to do so at once and for ever.\r\n\r\n"Some of you have mistaken me," he said, in a voice so strong and stern\r\nthat it almost startled them.  "The silly display of passion in one boy\r\nyesterday has led you to presume that you may trifle with me.  You are\r\nwrong.  For Williams\'s sake, as a boy who has, or at least once _had_,\r\nsomething noble in him, I left that matter in the Doctor\'s hands.  I\r\nshall _not_ do so to-night.  Which of you put out the candles?"\r\n\r\nDead silence.  A pause.\r\n\r\n"Which of you had the audacity to throw pieces of bread at me?"\r\n\r\nStill silence.\r\n\r\n"I warn you that I _will_ know, and it will be far worse for all the\r\nguilty if I do not know at once."  There was unmistakable decision in\r\nthe tone.\r\n\r\n"Very well.  I know many boys who were _not_ guilty, because I saw them\r\nin parts of the room where to throw was impossible.  I shall now _ask_\r\nall the rest, one by one, if they took any part in this.  And beware of\r\ntelling me a lie."\r\n\r\nThere was an uneasy sensation in the room, and several boys began to\r\nwhisper aloud, "Brigson!  Brigson!"  The whisper grew louder, and Mr\r\nRose heard it.  He turned on Brigson indignantly, and said--\r\n\r\n"They call your name; stand out!"\r\n\r\nThe awkward, big, ungainly boy, with his repulsive countenance, shambled\r\nout of his place into the middle of the room.  Mr Rose swept him with\r\none flashing glance.  "_That_ is the boy," thought he to himself, "who\r\nhas been like an ulcer to this school.  These boys shall have a good\r\nlook at their hero."  It was but recently that Mr Rose knew all the\r\nharm which Brigson had been doing, though he had discovered, almost from\r\nthe first, what _sort_ of character he had.\r\n\r\nSo Brigson stood out in the room, and as they looked at him, many a boy\r\ncursed him in their hearts.  And it was _that_ fellow, that stupid,\r\nclumsy, base compound of meanness and malice, that had ruled like a king\r\namong them.  Faugh!\r\n\r\n"They call your name!  Do you know anything of this?"\r\n\r\n"No!" said Brigson: "I\'ll swear I\'d nothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"Oh-h-h-h!"--the long, intense, deep-drawn expression of disgust and\r\ncontempt ran round the room.\r\n\r\n"You have told me a lie!" said Mr Rose slowly, and with strong\r\ncontempt.  "No words can express my loathing for your false and\r\ndishonourable conduct.  Nor shall your lie save you, as you shall find\r\nimmediately.  Still you shall escape if you can or dare to deny it\r\nagain.  I repeat my question--Were you engaged in this?"\r\n\r\nHe fixed his full, piercing eye on the culprit, whom it seemed to scorch\r\nand wither.  Brigson winced back, and said nothing.  "As I thought,"\r\nsaid Mr Rose.\r\n\r\n"Not one boy only, but many were engaged.  I shall call you up one by\r\none to answer me.  Wildney, come here."\r\n\r\nThe boy walked in front of the desk.\r\n\r\n"Were you one of those who threw?"\r\n\r\nWildney, full as he was of dangerous and deadly faults, was no coward,\r\nand not a liar.  He knew, or at least feared, that this new scrape might\r\nbe fatal to him, but raising his dark and glistening eyes to Mr Rose,\r\nhe said penitently--\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t throw, sir, but I _did_ put out one of the candles that it\r\nmight be done."\r\n\r\nThe contrast with Brigson was very great; the dark cloud hung a little\r\nless darkly on Mr Rose\'s forehead, and there was a very faint murmur of\r\napplause.\r\n\r\n"Good stand back.  Pietrie, come up."\r\n\r\nPietrie, too, confessed, and indeed all the rest of the plotters except\r\nBooking.  Mr Rose\'s lip curled with scorn as he heard the exclamation\r\nwhich his denial caused; but he suffered him to sit down.\r\n\r\nWhen Wright\'s turn came to be asked, Mr Rose said--"No!  I shall not\r\neven ask you, Wright.  I know well that your character is too good to be\r\ninvolved in such an attempt."\r\n\r\nThe boy bowed humbly, and sat down.  Among the last questioned was\r\nVernon Williams, and Mr Rose seemed anxious for his answer.\r\n\r\n"No," he said at once,--and seemed to wish to add something.\r\n\r\n"Go on," said Mr Rose encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir!  I only wanted to say that I hope you won\'t think Eric knew of\r\nthis.  He would have hated it, sir, more even than I do."\r\n\r\n"Good," said Mr Rose; "I am sure of it.  And now," turning to the\r\noffenders, "I shall teach you never to dare again to be guilty of such\r\npresumption and wickedness as to-night.  I shall punish you according to\r\nmy notion of your degrees of guilt.  Brigson, bring me a cane from that\r\ndesk."\r\n\r\nHe brought it.\r\n\r\n"Hold out your hand."\r\n\r\nThe cane fell, and instantly split up from top to bottom.  Mr Rose\r\nlooked at it, for it was new that morning.\r\n\r\n"Ha!  I see; more mischief; there is a hair in it."\r\n\r\nThe boys were too much frightened to smile at the complete success of\r\nthe trick.\r\n\r\n"Who did this?  I must be told at once."\r\n\r\n"I did, sir," said Wildney, stepping forward.\r\n\r\n"Ha! very well," said Mr Rose, while, in spite of his anger, a smile\r\nhovered at the corner of his lips.  "Go and borrow me a cane from Mr\r\nHarley."\r\n\r\nWhile he went there was unbroken silence.\r\n\r\n"Now, sir," said he to Brigson, "I shall flog you."  Corporal punishment\r\nwas avoided with the bigger boys, and Brigson had never undergone it\r\nbefore.  At the first stroke he writhed and yelled; at the second he\r\nretreated, twisting like a serpent, and blubbering like a baby; at the\r\nthird he flung himself on his knees, and as the strokes fell fast,\r\nclasped Mr Rose\'s arm, and implored and besought for mercy.\r\n\r\n"_Miserable_ coward," said Mr Rose, throwing into the word such ringing\r\nscorn that no one who heard it ever forgot it.  He indignantly shook the\r\nboy off, and caned him till he rolled on the floor, losing every\r\nparticle of self-control, and calling out, "The devil--the devil--the\r\ndevil!"  ("invoking his patron saint," as Wildney maliciously observed).\r\n\r\n"There! cease to blaspheme, and get up," said the master, blowing out a\r\ncloud of fiery indignation.  "There, sir.  Retribution comes at last,\r\nleaden-footed but iron-handed.  A long catalogue of sins is visited on\r\nyou to-day, and not only on your shrinking body, but on your conscience\r\ntoo, if you have one left.  Let those red marks betoken that your reign\r\nis ended.  Liar and tempter, you have led boys into the sins which you\r\nthen meanly deny!  And now, you boys, _there_ in that coward, who cannot\r\neven endure his richly-merited punishment, see the boy whom you have\r\nsuffered to be your _leader_ for well-nigh six months!"\r\n\r\n"Now, sir,"--again he turned upon Brigson--"that flogging shall be\r\nrepeated with interest on your next offence.  At present you will take\r\neach boy on your back while I cane him.  It is fit that they should see\r\nwhere _you_ lead them to."\r\n\r\nTrembling violently, and cowed beyond description, he did as he was bid.\r\nNo other boy cried, or even winced; a few sharp cuts was all which Mr\r\nRose gave them, and even they grew fewer each time, for he was tired,\r\nand displeased to be an executioner.\r\n\r\n"And now," he said, "since that disgusting but necessary scene is over,\r\n_never_ let me have to repeat it again."  But his authority was\r\nestablished like a rock from that night forward.  No one ever ventured\r\nto dispute it again, or forgot that evening.  Mr Rose\'s noble moral\r\ninfluence gained tenfold strength from the respect and wholesome fear\r\nthat he then inspired.\r\n\r\nBut, as he said, Brigson\'s reign was over.  Looks of the most\r\nunmitigated disgust and contempt were darted at him, as he sat alone and\r\nshunned at the end of the table; and the boys seemed now to loathe and\r\nnauseate the golden calf they had been worshipping.  He had not done\r\nblubbering even yet, when the prayer-bell rang.  No sooner had Mr Rose\r\nleft the room than Wildney, his dark eyes sparkling with rage, leaped on\r\nthe table, and shouted--\r\n\r\n"Three groans, hoots, and hisses for a liar and a coward," a sign of\r\nexecration which he was the first to lead off; and which the boys echoed\r\nlike a storm.\r\n\r\nAstonished at the tumult, Mr Rose reappeared at the door.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'re not hissing you, sir," said Wildney excitedly; "we\'re all\r\nhissing at lying and cowardice."\r\n\r\nMr Rose thought the revulsion of feeling might do good, and he was\r\nstriding out again without a word when--\r\n\r\n"Three times three for Mr Rose," sang out Wildney.\r\n\r\nNever did a more hearty or spontaneous cheer burst from the lips and\r\nlungs of fifty boys than that.  The news had spread like wildfire to the\r\nstudies, and the other boys came flocking in during the uproar, to join\r\nin it heartily.  Cheer after cheer rang out like a sound of silver\r\nclarions from the clear boy-voices; and in the midst of the excited\r\nthrong stood Eric and Montagu, side by side, hurrahing more lustily than\r\nall the rest.\r\n\r\nBut Mr Rose, in the library, was on his knees, with moving lips and\r\nlifted hands.  He coveted the popular applause as little as he had\r\ndreaded the popular opposition; and the evening\'s painful experiences\r\nhad taught him anew the bitter lesson to expect no gratitude, and hope\r\nfor no reward, but simply, and contentedly, and unmurmuringly, to work\r\non in God\'s vineyard so long as life and health should last.\r\n\r\nBrigson\'s brazen forehead bore him through the disgrace which would have\r\ncrushed another.  But still he felt that his position at Roslyn could\r\nnever be what it had been before, and he therefore determined to leave\r\nat once.  By grossly calumniating the school, he got his father to\r\nremove him, and announced, to every one\'s great delight, that he was\r\ngoing in a fortnight.  On his last day, by way of bravado, he smashed\r\nand damaged as much of the school property as he could, a proceeding\r\nwhich failed to gain him any admiration, and merely put his father to\r\nruinous expense.\r\n\r\nThe day after his exposure Eric had cut him dead, without the least\r\npretence of concealment; an example pretty generally followed throughout\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Brigson went up to Eric and hissed in his ear, "You cut\r\nme, curse you; but, _never fear, I\'ll be revenged on you yet_."\r\n\r\n"Do your worst," answered Eric contemptuously; "and never speak to me\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nRIPPLES.\r\n\r\n  Our echoes roll from soul to soul,\r\n  And live for ever and for ever.\r\n  _Tennyson_.\r\n\r\nOwen and Montagu were walking by Silverburn, and talking over the\r\naffairs of the school.  During their walk they saw Wright and Vernon\r\nWilliams in front of them.\r\n\r\n"I am so glad to see those two together," said Montagu; "I really think\r\nWright is one of the best little fellows in the school, and he\'ll be the\r\nsaving of Vernon.  He\'s already persuaded him to leave off smoking and\r\nother bad things, and has got him to work a little harder, and turn over\r\na new leaf altogether."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Owen; "I\'ve seen a marvellous improvement in little\r\nWilliams lately.  I think that Duncan gave him a rough lesson the other\r\nnight which did him good, and dear old Rose too has been leading him by\r\nthe hand; but the best thing is that, through Wright, he sees less of\r\nEric\'s _friend_, that young scapegrace Wildney."\r\n\r\n"Yes; that little wretch has a good deal to answer for.  What a pity\r\nthat Eric spoils him so, or rather suffers himself to be spoilt by him.\r\nI\'m glad Vernon\'s escaped his influence now: he\'s too fine a nature to\r\nbe made as bad as the general run of them.  What a brilliant little\r\nfellow he is; just like his brother."\r\n\r\n"Just like what his brother _was_," said Owen; "his face, like his mind,\r\nhas suffered lately."\r\n\r\n"Too true," answered Montagu, with a sigh; "and yet, cool as we now are\r\nin our outward intercourse, he little knows how I love him, and yearn\r\nfor the Eric I once knew--Eric the fair-haired, as Russell and I used\r\nsometimes to call him in fun.  Would to God poor Russell had lived, and\r\nthen I believe that he wouldn\'t have gone so far wrong."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think there\'s another chance for him now that--that--what name\r\nis bad enough for that Brigson?--is gone."\r\n\r\n"I hope so.  But,"--he added after a pause--"his works do follow him.\r\nLook there!"  He took a large stone and threw it into the Silverburn\r\nstream; there was a great splash, and the ever-widening circles of blue\r\nripple broke the surface of the water, dying away one by one in the\r\nsedges on the bank.  "There," he said, "see how long those ripples last,\r\nand how numerous they are."\r\n\r\nOwen understood him.  "Poor Eric!  What a gleam of new hope there was in\r\nhim after Russell\'s death!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for a time," said Montagu; "heigh ho!  I fear we shall never be\r\nwarm friends again.  We can\'t be while he goes on as he is doing.  And\r\nyet I love him."\r\n\r\nA sudden turn of the stream brought them to the place called Riverbend.\r\n\r\n"If you want a practical comment on what we\'ve been talking about,\r\nyou\'ll see it there," said Montagu.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a party of boys, four or five, all lying on a pleasant\r\ngrass bank, smoking pipes.  Prominent among them was Eric, stretched at\r\nease, and looking up at the clouds, towards which curled the puffed\r\nfumes of his meerschaum, a gift of Wildney\'s.  That worthy was beside\r\nhim similarly employed.\r\n\r\nThe two sixth-form boys hoped to pass by unobserved, as they did not\r\nwish for a rencontre with our hero under such circumstances.  But they\r\nsaw Wildney pointing to them, and, from the fits of laughter which\r\nfollowed his remarks, they had little doubt that they were the subject\r\nof the young gentleman\'s wit.  This is never a pleasant sensation; but\r\nthey observed that Eric made a point of not looking their way, and went\r\non in silence.\r\n\r\n"How very sad!" said Montagu.\r\n\r\n"How very contemptible!" said Owen.  "Harfagher among his subjects!"\r\n\r\n"Did you observe what they were doing?"\r\n\r\n"Smoking?"\r\n\r\n"Worse than that a good deal.  They were doing something which, if Eric\r\ndoesn\'t take care, will one day be his ruin."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I saw them drinking.  I have little doubt it was brandy."\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!"\r\n\r\n"It is getting a common practice with some fellows.  One of the ripples,\r\nyou see, of Brigson\'s influence."\r\n\r\nBefore they got home they caught up Wright and Vernon, and walked in\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve been talking," said Wright, "about a bad matter.  Vernon here\r\nsays that there\'s no good working for a prize in his form, because the\r\ncribbing\'s so atrocious.  Indeed, it\'s very nearly as bad in my form.\r\nIt always is under Gordon; he _can\'t_ understand fellows doing\r\ndishonourable things."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a great bore in the weekly examinations," said Vernon; "every now\r\nand then Gordon will even leave the room for a few minutes, and then out\r\ncome dozens of books."\r\n\r\n"Well, Wright," said Montagu, "if that happens again next examination,\r\nI\'d speak out about it."\r\n\r\n"How?"\r\n\r\n"Why, I\'d get every fellow who disapproves of it to give me his name,\r\nand get up and read the list, and say that you at least have pledged\r\nyourselves not to do it."\r\n\r\n"Humph!  I don\'t know how that would answer.  They\'d half kill me for\r\none thing."\r\n\r\n"Never mind; do your duty.  I wish I\'d such an opportunity, if only to\r\nshow how sorry I am for my own past unfairness."\r\n\r\nAnd so talking, the four went in, and the two elder went to their study.\r\n\r\nIt was too true that drinking had become a common vice at Roslyn School.\r\nAccordingly, when Eric came in with Wildney about half an hour after,\r\nOwen and Montagu heard them talk about ordering some brandy, and then\r\narrange to have a "jollification," as they called it, that evening.\r\n\r\nThey got the brandy through "Billy."  One of Brigson\'s most cursed\r\nlegacies to the school was the introduction of this man to a nefarious\r\nintercourse with the boys.  His character was so well-known that it had\r\nlong been forbidden, under the strictest penalty, for any boy ever to\r\nspeak to him; yet, strange to say, they seemed to take a pleasure in\r\ndoing so, and just now particularly, it was thought a fine thing, a sign\r\nof "pluck" and "anti-muffishness," to be on familiar and intimate terms\r\nwith that degraded and villainous scoundrel.\r\n\r\nDuncan had made friends again with Eric; but he did not join him in his\r\nescapades and excesses, and sat much in other studies.  He had not been\r\naltogether a good boy, but yet there was a sort of rough honesty and\r\ngood sense in him which preserved him from the worst and most dangerous\r\nfailings, and his character had been gradually improving as he mounted\r\nhigher in the school.  He was getting steadier, more diligent, more\r\nthoughtful, more manly; he was passing through that change so frequent\r\nin boys as they grow older, to which Eric was so sad an exception.\r\nAccordingly Duncan, though sincerely fond of Eric, had latterly\r\ndisapproved vehemently of his proceedings, and had therefore taken to\r\nsnubbing his old friend Wildney, in whose favour Eric seemed to have an\r\ninfatuation, and who was the means of involving him in every kind of\r\nimpropriety and mischief.  So that night Duncan, hearing of what was\r\nintended, sat in the next study, and Eric, with Ball, Wildney, Graham,\r\nand Pietrie, had the room to themselves.  Several of them were lower\r\nboys still, but they came up to the studies after bed-time, according to\r\nWildney\'s almost nightly custom.\r\n\r\nA little pebble struck the study window.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" said Wildney, clapping his hands, "here\'s the grub."\r\n\r\nThey opened the window and looked out.  Billy was there, and they let\r\ndown to him a long piece of cord, to which he attached a basket, and,\r\nafter bidding them "Good-night, and a merry drink," retired.  No sooner\r\nhad they shut the window, than he grimaced as usual towards them, and\r\nshook his fist in a sort of demoniacal exultation, muttering, "Oh, I\'ll\r\nhave you all under my thumb yet, you fine young fools!"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the unconscious boys had opened the basket, and spread its\r\ncontents on the table.  They were bread, butter, a large dish of\r\nsausages, a tart, beer, and, alas! a bottle of brandy.\r\n\r\nThey soon got very noisy, and at last uproarious.  The snatches of\r\nsongs, peals of laughter, and rattle of plates at last grew so loud that\r\nthe other study-boys were afraid lest one of the masters should come up\r\nand catch the revellers.  All of them heard every word that was spoken\r\nby Eric and his party, as the walls between the rooms were very thin;\r\nand very objectionable much of the conversation was.\r\n\r\n"This _won\'t_ do," said Duncan emphatically, after a louder burst of\r\nmerriment than usual; "those fellows are getting drunk; I can tell it to\r\na certainty from the confused and random way, in which some of them are\r\ntalking."\r\n\r\n"We\'d better go in and speak to them," said Montagu; "at any rate,\r\nthey\'ve no right to disturb us all night.  Will you come?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll join you," said Owen; "though I\'m afraid my presence won\'t do you\r\nmuch good."\r\n\r\nThe three boys went to the door of Eric\'s study and their knock could\r\nnot at first be heard for the noise.  When they went in they found a\r\nscene of reckless disorder; books were scattered about, plates and\r\nglasses lay broken on the floor, beer was spilt on all sides, and there\r\nwas an intolerable smell of brandy.\r\n\r\n"If you fellows don\'t take care," said Duncan sharply, "Rose or\r\nsomebody\'ll be coming up and catching you.  It\'s ten now."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you?" answered Graham, with an insolent look.\r\n\r\n"It\'s something to me that you nice young men have been making such a\r\nrow that none of the rest of us can hear our own voices, and that\r\nbetween you you\'ve made this study in such a mess that I can\'t endure\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said Pietrie; "we\'re all getting such saints, that one can\'t\r\nhave the least bit of spree nowadays."\r\n\r\n"Spree!" burst in Montagu indignantly; "fine spree--to make sots of\r\nyourselves with spirits; fine spree to--"\r\n\r\n"Amen!" said Wildney, who was perched on the back of a chair; and he\r\nturned up his eyes and clasped his hands with a mock-heroic air.\r\n\r\n"There, Williams," continued Montagu, pointing to the\r\nmischievous-looking little boy; "see that spectacle, and be ashamed of\r\nyourself, if you can.  That\'s what you lead boys to!  Are you anxious to\r\nbecome the teacher of drunkenness?"\r\n\r\nIn truth, there was good ground for his sorrowful apostrophe, for the\r\nscene was very painful to a high-minded witness.\r\n\r\nThey hardly understood the look on Eric\'s countenance; he had been\r\ntaking far more than was good for him; his eyes sparkled fiercely, and\r\nthough as yet he said nothing, he seemed to be resenting the intrusion\r\nin furious silence.\r\n\r\n"How much longer is this interesting lecture to last?" asked Ball, with\r\nhis usual insufferable tone; "for I want to finish my brandy."\r\n\r\nMontagu rather looked as if he intended to give the speaker a box on the\r\near; but he was just deciding that he wasn\'t worth the trouble, when\r\nWildney, who had been grimacing all the time, burst into a fit of\r\nsatirical laughter.\r\n\r\n"Here, Wildney," said Graham; "just hand me _The Whole Duty of Man_, or\r\nsomething of that sort, from the shelf, will you?  That\'s a brick."\r\n\r\n"Certainly.  Let\'s see; Watts\'s Hymns; _I_ bag those for myself," said\r\nWildney; "they\'ll just suit--"\r\n\r\n  "How doth the little--"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s turn out these impudent lower-school fellows," said Montagu,\r\nspeaking to Duncan.  "Here! you go first," he said, seizing Wildney by\r\nthe arm, and giving him a swing, which, as he was by no means steady on\r\nhis legs, brought him sprawling to the ground, and sent Watts\'s Hymns\r\nflying open-leaved under the table.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, I won\'t stand this any longer," shouted Eric, springing up\r\nferociously.  "What on earth do you mean by daring to come in like this?\r\nDo you hear?"\r\n\r\nMontagu took no sort of notice of his threatening gesture, for he was\r\nlooking to see if Wildney was hurt, and finding he was not, proceeded to\r\ndrag him out, struggling and kicking frantically.\r\n\r\n"Drop me, you fellow, drop me, I say.  I won\'t go for you," cried\r\nWildney, clinging tight to a chair.  "Eric, why do you let him bully\r\nme?"\r\n\r\n"You let him go this minute," repeated Eric hoarsely.\r\n\r\n"I shall do no such thing.  You don\'t know what you\'re about."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t I?  Well then, take _that_, to show whether I do or no!"  And\r\nsuddenly leaning forward, he struck Montagu a violent back-handed blow\r\non the mouth.\r\n\r\nEverybody saw it, everybody heard it; and it instantly astounded them\r\ninto silence.  That Montagu should have been so struck in public, and\r\nthat by Eric--by a boy who had been his schoolfellow for three years\r\nnow, and whose whole life seemed bound to him by so many associations;\r\nit was strange and sad indeed.\r\n\r\nMontagu sprang straight upright; for an instant he took one stride\r\ntowards his striker with lifted hand and lightening eyes, while the\r\nblood started to his lips in consequence of the blow.  But he stopped\r\nsuddenly, and his hand fell to his side; by a strong effort of\r\nself-control he contrived to master himself; and sitting down quite\r\nquietly on a chair, he put his white handkerchief to his wounded mouth,\r\nand took it away stained with blood.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke; and rising with quiet dignity, he went back into his study\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Duncan; "you may all do as you like; only I heartily\r\nhope now you will be caught.  Come, Owen."\r\n\r\n"O Williams," said Owen, "you are changed indeed, to treat your best\r\nfriend so."\r\n\r\nBut Eric was excited with drink, and the slave of every evil passion at\r\nthat moment.  "Serve him right," he said; "what business has he to\r\ninterfere with what I choose to do?"\r\n\r\nThere was no more noise that night.  Wildney and the rest slunk off\r\nashamed and frightened, and Eric, leaving his candle flaring on the\r\ntable, went down to his bedroom, where he was very sick.  He had neither\r\nstrength nor spirit to undress, and flung himself into bed just as he\r\nwas.  When they heard that he was gone, Owen and Duncan (for Montagu was\r\nsilent and melancholy) went into his study, put out the candle, and only\r\njust cleared away, to the best of their power, the traces of the\r\ncarouse, when Dr Rowlands came up stairs on his usual nightly rounds.\r\nThey had been lighting brown paper to take away the fumes of the brandy,\r\nand the Doctor asked them casually the cause of the smell of burning.\r\nNeither of them answered, and seeing Owen there, in whom he placed\r\nimplicit trust, the Doctor thought no more about it.\r\n\r\nEric awoke with a bad headache, and a sense of shame and sickness.  When\r\nhe got up he felt most wretched; and while washing he thought to\r\nhimself, "Ah! that I could thus wash away the memory of last night!"  Of\r\ncourse, after what had occurred, Eric and Montagu were no longer on\r\nspeaking terms, and miserable as poor Eric felt when he saw how his blow\r\nhad bruised and disfigured his friend\'s face, he made no advances.  He\r\nlonged, indeed, from his inmost heart, to be reconciled to him; but\r\nfeeling that he had done grievous wrong, he dreaded a repulse, and his\r\npride would not suffer him to run the risk.  So he pretended to feel no\r\nregret, and, supported by his late boon companions, represented the\r\nmatter as occurring in the defence of Wildney, whom Montagu was\r\nbullying.\r\n\r\nMontagu, too, was very miserable; but he felt that, although ready to\r\nforgive Eric, he could not, in common self-respect, take the first step\r\nto a reconciliation; indeed, he rightly thought that it was not for\r\nEric\'s good that he should do so.\r\n\r\n"You and Williams appear never to speak to each other now," said Mr\r\nRose.  "I am sorry for it, Monty; I think you are the only boy who has\r\nany influence over him."\r\n\r\n"I fear you are mistaken, sir, in that.  Little Wildney has much more."\r\n\r\n"Wildney?" asked Mr Rose, in sorrowful surprise.  "Wildney more\r\ninfluence than _you_?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Ah, that our poor Edwin had lived!"\r\n\r\nSo, with a sigh, Walter Rose and Harry Montagu buried their friendship\r\nfor Eric until happier days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nERIC AND MONTAGU.\r\n\r\n  And constancy lives in realms above;\r\n  And life is thorny; and youth is vain;\r\n  And to be wroth with one we love\r\n  Doth work like madness in the brain.\r\n\r\n  Each spoke words of high disdain,\r\n  And insult to his heart\'s best brother.\r\n  _Coleridge\'s Christabel_.\r\n\r\nWright had not forgotten Montagu\'s advice, and had endeavoured to get\r\nthe names of boys who weren\'t afraid to scout publicly the disgrace of\r\ncheating in form.  But he could only get one name promised him--the name\r\nof Vernon Williams; and feeling how little could be gained by using it,\r\nhe determined to spare Vernon the trial, and speak, if he spoke at all,\r\non his own responsibility.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the cribbing at the next weekly examination was well-nigh\r\nuniversal, and when Mr Gordon went out to fetch something he had\r\nforgotten, merely saying, "I trust to your honour not to abuse my\r\nabsence," books and papers were immediately pulled out with the coolest\r\nand most unblushing indifference.\r\n\r\nThis was the time for Wright to deliver his conscience; he had counted\r\nthe cost, and, rightly or wrongly, considering it to be his duty, he had\r\ndecided that speak he would.  He well knew that his interference would\r\nbe attributed to jealousy, meanness, sneaking, and every kind of wrong\r\nmotive, since he was himself one of the greatest sufferers from the\r\nprevalent dishonesty; but still he had come to the conclusion that he\r\n_ought_ not to draw back, and therefore he bravely determined that he\r\nwould make his protest, whatever happened.\r\n\r\nSo, very nervously, he rose and said, "I want to tell you all that I\r\nthink this cheating very wrong and blackguardly.  I don\'t mind losing by\r\nit myself; but if Vernon Williams loses the prize in the lower-fourth,\r\nand any one gets it by copying, I\'ve made up my mind to tell Gordon."\r\n\r\nHis voice trembled a little at first, but he spoke fast, and acquired\r\nfirmness as he went on.  Absolute astonishment and curiosity had held\r\nthe boys silent with amazement, but by the end of this sentence they had\r\nrecovered themselves, and a perfect burst of derision and indignation\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see if _that\'ll_ cut short his oration," said Wildney, throwing a\r\nbook at his head, which was instantly followed by others from all\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n"My word! we\'ve had nothing but lectures lately," said Booking.  "Horrid\r\nlittle Owenite saint."\r\n\r\n"Saint!--sneak, you mean.  I\'ll teach him," growled Pietrie, and jumping\r\nup, he belaboured Wright\'s head with the Latin Grammar out of which he\r\nhad just been cribbing.\r\n\r\nThe whole room was in confusion and hubbub, during which Wright sat\r\nstock-still, quietly enduring without bowing to the storm.\r\n\r\nOnly one boy sympathised with him, but he did so deeply--poor little\r\npenitent Vernon.  He felt his position hard because Wright had alluded\r\nso prominently to him, and he knew how much he must be misconstrued but\r\nhe had his brother\'s spirit, and would not shrink.  Amid the tumult he\r\ngot up in his seat, and they heard his pleasant childish voice saying\r\nboldly, "I hope Wright won\'t tell; but he\'s the best fellow in the room,\r\nand cribbing _is_ a shame, as he says."\r\n\r\nWhat notice would have been taken of this speech is doubtful, for at the\r\ncritical moment Mr Gordon reappeared, and the whispered cave caused\r\ninstantaneous quiet.\r\n\r\nPoor Wright awaited with some dread the end of school; and many an angry\r\nkick and blow he got, though he disarmed malice by the spirit and\r\nheroism with which he endured them.  The news of his impudence spread\r\nlike wildfire, and not five boys in the school approved of what he had\r\ndone, while most of them were furious at his ill-judged threat of\r\ninforming Mr Gordon.  There was a general agreement to thrash him after\r\nroll-call that afternoon.\r\n\r\nEric had lately taken a violent dislike to Wright, though he had been\r\nfond of him in better days.  He used to denounce him as a disagreeable\r\nand pragmatical little muff, and was as loud as any of them in\r\ncondemning his announced determination to "sneak."  Had he known that\r\nWright had acted under Montagu\'s well-meant, though rather mistaken\r\nadvice, he might have abstained from having anything more to do with the\r\nmatter, but now he promised to kick Wright himself after the four\r\no\'clock bell.\r\n\r\nFour o\'clock came; the names were called; the master left the room.\r\nWright, who perfectly knew what was threatened, stood there pale but\r\nfearless.  His indifferent look was an additional annoyance to Eric, who\r\nwalked up to him carelessly, and boxing his ears, though without hurting\r\nhim, said contemptuously, "Conceited little sneak."\r\n\r\nMontagu had been told of the intended kicking, and had determined even\r\nsingle-handed to prevent it.  He did _not_, however, expect that Eric\r\nwould have taken part in it, and was therefore unprepared.  The colour\r\nrushed into his cheeks; he went up, took Wright quietly by the hand, and\r\nsaid with firm determination, "No one in the school shall touch Wright\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"What? no one! just hark to that," said Graham; "I suppose he thinks\r\nhimself cock of the school."\r\n\r\nEric quite misunderstood Montagu\'s proceeding; he took it for a public\r\nchallenge.  All the Rowlandites were round, and to yield would have\r\nlooked like cowardice.  Above all, his evil genius Wildney was by, and\r\nsaid, "How very nice!  I say, Eric, you and I will have to get _The\r\nWhole Duty of Man_ again."\r\n\r\nA threatening circle had formed round Montagu, but his closed lips and\r\nflushing brow and dilated nostrils betrayed a spirit which made them\r\nwaver, and his noble face glowed with a yet nobler expression in the\r\nconsciousness of an honourable cause, as he quietly repeated, "No one\r\nshall touch you, Wright."\r\n\r\n"They _will_, though," said Eric instantly; "_I_ will, for one, and I\r\nshould like to see you prevent me."  And so saying he gave Wright\r\nanother slight blow.\r\n\r\nMontagu dropped Wright\'s hand, and said slowly, "Eric Williams, I have\r\ntaken one unexpected blow from you without a word, and bear the marks of\r\nit yet.  It is time to show that it was _not_ through cowardice that I\r\ndid not return it.  Will you fight?"\r\n\r\nThe answer was not prompt by any means, though every one in the school\r\nknew that Eric was not afraid.  So sure was he of this, that, for the\r\nsake of "auld lang syne," he would probably have declined to fight with\r\nMontagu had it been left to his own impulses.\r\n\r\n"I have been in the wrong, Montagu, more than once," he answered\r\nfalteringly, "and we have been friends--"\r\n\r\nBut it was the object of many of the worst boys that the two should\r\nfight--not only that they might see the fun, but that Montagu\'s\r\nauthority, which stood in their way, might be flung aside.  So Booking\r\nwhispered in an audible voice--\r\n\r\n"Faith! he\'s showing the white feather."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a liar!" flung in Eric; and turning to Montagu, he said, "There!\r\nI\'ll fight you this moment."\r\n\r\nInstantly they had stripped off their coats and prepared for action.  A\r\nring of excited boys crowded round them.  Fellows of sixteen, like\r\nMontagu and Eric, rarely fight, because their battles have usually been\r\ndecided in their earlier schooldays; and it was also but seldom that two\r\nboys so strong, active, and prominent (above all, so high in the school)\r\ntook this method of settling their differences.\r\n\r\nThe fight began, and at first the popular favour was entirely on the\r\nside of Eric, while Montagu found few or none to back him.  But he\r\nfought with a fire and courage which soon won applause; and as Eric, on\r\nthe other hand, was random and spiritless, the cry was soon pretty\r\nfairly divided between them.\r\n\r\nAfter a sharp round they paused for breath, and Owen, who had been a\r\nsilent and disgusted spectator of such a combat between boys of such\r\nhigh standing, said with much feeling--\r\n\r\n"This is not a very creditable affair, Montagu."\r\n\r\n"It is necessary," was Montagu\'s laconic reply.  Among other boys who\r\nhad left the room before the fracas had taken place was Vernon Williams,\r\nwho shrank away to avoid the pain of seeing his new friend Wright\r\nbullied and tormented.  But curiosity soon took him back, and he came in\r\njust as the second round began.  At first he only saw a crowd of boys in\r\nthe middle of the room, but jumping on a desk, he had a full view of\r\nwhat was going on.\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous hubbub of voices, and Eric, now thoroughly roused\r\nby the remarks he overheard, and especially by Wildney\'s whisper that\r\n"he was letting himself be licked," was exerting himself with more\r\nvigour and effect.  It was anything but a pleasant sight; the faces of\r\nthe combatants were streaked with blood and sweat, and as the miserable\r\ngang of lower-school boys backed them on with eager shouts of--"Now\r\nEric, now Eric."  "Now Montagu, go it sixth-form," etcetera, both of\r\nthem fought under a sense of deep disgrace, increased by the\r\nrecollections which they shared in common.\r\n\r\nAll this Vernon marked in a moment, and, filled with pain and vexation,\r\nhe said in a voice which, though low, could be heard amid all the\r\nuproar, "O Eric, Eric, fighting with Montagu!"  There was reproach and\r\nsorrow in the tone, which touched more than one boy there, for Vernon,\r\nspite of the recent change in him, could not but continue a popular\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\n"Shut up there, you little donkey," shouted one or two, looking back at\r\nhim for a moment.\r\n\r\nBut Eric heard the words, and knew that it was his brother\'s voice.  The\r\nthought rushed on him how degraded his whole position was, and how\r\ndifferent it might have been.  He felt that he was utterly in the wrong,\r\nand Montagu altogether in the right; and from that moment his blows once\r\nmore grew feeble and ill-directed.  When they again stopped to take\r\nrest, the general shout for Montagu showed that he was considered to\r\nhave the best of it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m getting so tired of this," muttered Eric, during the pause.\r\n\r\n"Why, you\'re fighting like a regular muff," said Graham; "you\'ll have to\r\nacknowledge yourself thrashed in a minute."\r\n\r\n"That I\'ll _never_ do," he said, once more firing up.  Just as the third\r\nround began, Duncan came striding in, for Owen, who had left the room,\r\ntold him what was going on.  He had always been a leading fellow, and\r\nquite recently his influence had several times been exerted in the right\r\ndirection, and he was very much looked up to by all the boys alike, good\r\nor bad.  He determined, for the credit of the sixth, that the fight\r\nshould not go on, and bursting into the ring, with his strong shoulders\r\nhe hurled on each side the boys who stood in his way, and struck down\r\nthe lifted arms of the fighters.\r\n\r\n"You _shan\'t_ fight," he said doggedly, thrusting himself between them;\r\n"so there\'s an end of it.  If you do, you\'ll both have to fight me\r\nfirst."\r\n\r\n"Shame!" said several of the boys, and the cry was caught up by Ball and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"Shame, is it?" said Duncan, and his lip curled with scorn.  "There\'s\r\nonly one way to argue with you fellows.  Ball, if you or any other boy\r\nrepeat that word, I\'ll thrash him.  Here, Monty, come away from this\r\ndisgraceful scene."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sick enough of it," said Montagu, "and am ready to stop if Williams\r\nis,--provided no one touches Wright."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sick of it too," said Eric sullenly.\r\n\r\n"Then you two shall shake hands," said Duncan.\r\n\r\nFor one instant--an instant which he regretted till the end of his\r\nlife--Montagu drew himself up and hesitated.  He had been deeply\r\nwronged, deeply provoked, and no one could blame him for the momentary\r\nfeeling; but Eric had observed the gesture, and his passionate pride\r\ntook the alarm.  "It\'s come to this then," he thought; "Montagu doesn\'t\r\nthink me good enough to be shaken hands with."\r\n\r\n"Pish!" he said aloud, in a tone of sarcasm; "it may be an awful honour\r\nto shake hands with such an immaculate person as Montagu, but I\'m not\r\nproud on the subject," and he turned away.\r\n\r\nMontagu\'s hesitation was but momentary, and without a particle of anger\r\nor indignation he sorrowfully held out his hand.  It was too late; that\r\nmoment had done the mischief, and it was now Eric\'s turn coldly to\r\nwithdraw.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t think me worthy of your friendship, and what\'s the good of\r\ngrasping hands if we don\'t do it with cordial hearts?"\r\n\r\nMontagu\'s lip trembled, but he said nothing, and quietly putting on his\r\ncoat, motioned back the throng of boys with a sweep of his arm, and left\r\nthe room with Duncan.\r\n\r\n"Come along, Wright," he said.\r\n\r\n"Nay, leave him," said Eric, with a touch of remorse.  "Much as you\r\nthink me beneath you, I have honour enough to see that no one hurts\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nThe group of boys gradually dispersed, but one or two remained with\r\nEric, although he was excessively wearied by their observations.\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t fight half like yourself," said Wildney.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you tell why?  I had the wrong side to fight for."  And getting\r\nup abruptly, he left the room, to be alone in his study, and bathe his\r\nswollen and aching face.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Vernon joined him, and at the mere sight of him Eric\r\nturned away in shame.  That evening with Vernon in the study, after the\r\ndinner at "The Jolly Herring," had revived all his really warm affection\r\nfor his little brother; and as he could no longer conceal the line he\r\ntook in the school, they had been often together since then; and Eric\'s\r\nmoral obliquity was not so great as to prevent him from feeling--deep\r\njoy at the change for the better in Vernon\'s character.\r\n\r\n"Verny, Verny," he said, as the boy came up and affectionately took his\r\nhand, "it was you that lost me that fight."\r\n\r\n"Oh, but, Eric, you were fighting with Montagu.  Don\'t you remember the\r\ndays, Eric," he continued, "when we were home-boarders, and how kind\r\nMonty used to be to me even then, and how mother liked him, and thought\r\nhim quite your truest friend, except poor Russell?"\r\n\r\n"I do indeed.  I didn\'t think then that it would come to this."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always been _so_ sorry," said Vernon, "that I joined the fellows\r\nin playing him tricks.  I can\'t think how I came to do it, except that\r\nI\'ve done such lots of bad things here.  But he\'s forgiven and forgotten\r\nthat long ago, and is very kind to me now."\r\n\r\nIt was true; but Eric didn\'t know that half the kindness which Montagu\r\nshowed to his brother was shown solely for _his_ sake.\r\n\r\n"Do you know, I\'ve thought of a plan for making you two friends again?\r\nI\'ve written to Aunt Trevor to ask him to Fairholm with us next\r\nholidays."\r\n\r\n"Oh, have you?  Good Verny!  Yes; _there_ we might be friends.  Perhaps\r\nthere," he added, half to himself, "I might be more like what I was in\r\nbetter days."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s a long time to look forward to.  Easter hasn\'t come yet," said\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\nSo the two young boys proposed; but God had disposed it otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n  Et motae ad Lunam trepidabis arundinis umbram.  _Juvenal_ x. 21.\r\n\r\n"How awfully dull it is, Charlie," said Eric, a few weeks before Easter,\r\nas he sat with Wildney in his study one holiday afternoon.\r\n\r\n"Yes; too late for football, too early for cricket."  And Wildney\r\nstretched himself and yawned.\r\n\r\n"I suppose this is what they call ennui," said Eric again, after a\r\npause.  "What\'s to be done, Sunbeam?"\r\n\r\n"You _shan\'t_ call me that, Eric the fair-haired; you _shan\'t_ call me\r\nthat, so there\'s an end of it," said Wildney, hitting him on the arm.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Charlie, don\'t call _me_ that either; it is a name that--never\r\nmind; only don\'t--that\'s a good fellow."\r\n\r\n"By the bye, Eric, I\'ve just remembered to-morrow\'s my birthday, and\r\nI\'ve got a parcel coming this afternoon full of grub from home.  Let\'s\r\ngo and see if it\'s come."\r\n\r\n"Capital!  We will."\r\n\r\nSo Eric and Wildney started off to the coach-office, where they found\r\nthe hamper, and ordered it to be brought at once to the school, and\r\ncarried up to Eric\'s study.\r\n\r\nOn opening it they found it rich in dainties, among which were a pair of\r\nfowls and a large plum-cake.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" said Wildney; "you were talking of nothing to do; I vote we\r\nhave a carouse to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Very well; only let\'s have it _before_ prayers, because we so nearly\r\ngot caught last time."\r\n\r\n"Ay, and let it be in one of the classrooms, Eric; not up here, lest we\r\nhave another incursion of the `Rosebuds.\'  I shall have to cut\r\npreparation, but that don\'t matter.  It\'s Harley\'s night, and old Stupid\r\nwill never twig."\r\n\r\n"Well, whom shall we ask?" said Eric.\r\n\r\n"Old Llewellyn for one," said Wildney.  "We haven\'t seen him for an age,\r\nand he\'s getting too lazy even for a bit of fun."\r\n\r\n"Good; and Graham?" suggested Eric.  He and Wildney regarded their\r\npossessions so much as common property, that he hadn\'t the least\r\ndelicacy in mentioning the boys whom he wanted to invite.\r\n\r\n"Yes; Graham\'s a jolly bird; and Ball?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no objection; and Pietrie?"\r\n\r\n"Well; and your brother Vernon?"\r\n\r\n"No!" said Eric emphatically.  "At any rate I won\'t lead _him_ into\r\nmischief any more."\r\n\r\n"Attlay, then; and what do you say to Booking?"\r\n\r\n"No, again," said Eric; "he\'s a blackguard."\r\n\r\n"I wonder you haven\'t mentioned Duncan," said Wildney.\r\n\r\n"Duncan! why, my good fellow, you might as well ask Owen, or even old\r\nRose at once.  Bless you, Charlie, he\'s a great deal too correct to come\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"Well; we\'ve got six already, that\'s quite enough."\r\n\r\n"Yes; but two fowls isn\'t enough for six hungry boys."\r\n\r\n"No, it isn\'t," said Wildney.  He thought a little, and then, clapping\r\nhis hands, danced about, and said, "Are you game for a _regular_ lark,\r\nEric?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; anything to make it less dull.  I declare.  I\'ve very nearly been\r\ntaking to work again to fill up the time."\r\n\r\nEric often talked now of work in this slighting way, partly as an excuse\r\nfor the low places in form, to which he was gradually sinking.\r\nEverybody knew that had he properly exerted his abilities he was capable\r\nof beating almost any boy; so, to quiet his conscience, he professed to\r\nridicule diligence as an unboyish piece of muffishness, and was never\r\nslow to sneer at the "grinders," as he contemptuously called all those\r\nwho laid themselves out to win school distinctions.\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha!" said Wildney, "that\'s rather good!  No, Eric, it\'s too late\r\nfor you to turn `grinder\' now.  I might as well think of doing it myself\r\nand I\'ve never been higher than five from lag in my form yet."\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you?  But what\'s the regular lark you hinted at?"\r\n\r\n"First of all, I hope you won\'t think the _lark_ less larky because it\'s\r\nconnected with _pigeons_," said Wildney.\r\n\r\n"Ridiculous little Sphinx!  What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, we\'ll go and seize the Gordonites\' pigeons, and make another dish\r\nof them."\r\n\r\n"Seize the Gordonites\' pigeons!  Why, when do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"To-night."\r\n\r\nEric gave a long whistle.  "But wouldn\'t it be stea--stea--?"\r\n\r\n"Stealing?" said Wildney, with a loud laugh.  "Pooh! `_convey_ the wise\r\nit call.\'"\r\n\r\nBut Eric still looked serious.  "Why, my dear old boy," continued\r\nWildney, "the Gordonites\'ll be the first to laugh at the trick when we\r\ntell them of it next morning, as of course we will do.  There, now,\r\ndon\'t look grumpy.  I shall cut away and arrange it with Graham, and\r\ntell you the whole dodge ready prepared to-night at bed-time."\r\n\r\nAfter lights were put out, Wildney came up to the study according to\r\npromise, and threw out hints about the proposed plan.  He didn\'t tell it\r\nplainly, because Duncan was there, but Duncan caught quite enough to\r\nguess that some night excursion was intended, and said, when Wildney had\r\ngone--\r\n\r\n"Take my advice, and have nothing to do with this, Eric."\r\n\r\nEric had grown very touchy lately about advice, particularly from any\r\nfellow of his own standing; and after the checks he had recently\r\nreceived, a coolness had sprung up between him and nearly all the\r\nstudy-boys, which made him more than ever inclined to assert his\r\nindependence, and defy and thwart them in every way.\r\n\r\n"Keep your advice to yourself; Duncan, till it\'s asked for," he answered\r\nroughly.  "You\'ve done nothing but _advise_ lately, and I\'m rather sick\r\nof it."\r\n\r\n"Comme vous voulez," replied Duncan, with a shrug.  "Gang your own gait;\r\nI\'ll have nothing more to do with trying to stop you since you _will_\r\nruin yourself."\r\n\r\nNothing more was said in the study that evening, and when Eric went down\r\nhe didn\'t even bid Duncan good-night.\r\n\r\n"Charlie," he said, as he stole on tiptoe into Wildney\'s dormitory.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" whispered Wildney, "the other fellows are asleep.  Come and sit\r\nby my bedside, and I\'ll tell you what we are going to do."\r\n\r\nEric went and sat by him, and he sat up in his bed.  "First of all,\r\n_you\'re_ to keep awake till twelve to-night," he whispered; "old\r\nRowley\'ll have gone round by that time, and it\'ll be all safe.  Then\r\ncome and awake me again, and I\'ll watch till one, Pietrie till two, and\r\nGraham till three.  Then Graham\'ll awake us all, and we\'ll dress."\r\n\r\n"Very well.  But how will you get the key of the lavatory?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll manage that," said Wildney, chuckling.  "But come again and\r\nawake me at twelve, will you?"\r\n\r\nEric went to his room and lay down, but he didn\'t take off his clothes,\r\nfor fear he should go to sleep.  Dr Rowlands came round as usual at\r\neleven, and then Eric closed his eyes for a few minutes, till the\r\nhead-master had disappeared.  After that he lay awake thinking for an\r\nhour, but his thoughts weren\'t very pleasant.\r\n\r\nAt twelve he went and awoke Wildney.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel very sleepy.  Shall I sit with you for your hour,\r\nCharlie?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, do!  I should like it of all things.  But douse the glim there; we\r\nshan\'t want it, and it might give the alarm."\r\n\r\n"All right."\r\n\r\nSo Eric went and sat by his dangerous little friend, and they talked in\r\nlow voices until they heard the great school-clock strike one.  They\r\nthen woke Pietrie, and Eric went off to bed again.\r\n\r\nAt three Graham awoke him, and dressing hastily, he joined the others in\r\nthe lavatory.\r\n\r\n"Now I\'m going to get the key," said Wildney, "and mean to feel very\r\npoorly for the purpose."\r\n\r\nLaughing quietly, he went up to the door of Mr Harley\'s bedroom, which\r\nopened out of the lavatory, and knocked.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nHe knocked a little louder.\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\nLouder still.\r\n\r\n"Bother the fellow," said Wildney; "he sleeps like a grampus.  Won\'t one\r\nof you try to wake him?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Graham; "\'tain\'t dignified."\r\n\r\n"Well, I must try again."  But it seemed no use knocking, and Wildney at\r\nlast, in a fit of impatience, thumped a regular tattoo on the bedroom\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?" said the startled voice of Mr Harley.\r\n\r\n"Only me, sir!" answered Wildney, in a mild and innocent way.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?"\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, I want the key of the lavatory.  I want to see the doctor.\r\nI\'m indisposed," said Wildney again, in a tone of such disciplined\r\nsuavity, that the others shook with laughing.\r\n\r\nMr Harley opened the door about an inch, and peered out suspiciously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, you must go and awake Mr Rose.  I don\'t happen to have the\r\nkey to-night."  And so saying, he shut the door.\r\n\r\n"Phew!  Here\'s a go!" said Wildney, recovering immediately.  "It\'ll\r\nnever do to awake old Rose.  He\'d smell a rat in no time."\r\n\r\n"I have it," said Pietrie.  "I\'ve got an old nail, with which I believe\r\nI can open the lock quite simply.  Let\'s try."\r\n\r\n"Quietly and quick, then," said Eric.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes he had silently shot back the lock with the old nail, and\r\nthe boys were on the landing.\r\n\r\nThey carried their shoes in their hands, ran noiselessly down stairs,\r\nand went to the same window at which Eric and Wildney had got out\r\nbefore.  Wildney had taken care beforehand to break the pane and move\r\naway the glass, so they had only to loosen the bar and slip through one\r\nby one.\r\n\r\nIt was cold and very dark, and as on the March morning they stood out in\r\nthe playground, all four would rather have been safely and harmlessly in\r\nbed.  But the novelty and the excitement of the enterprise bore them up,\r\nand they started off quickly for the house at which Mr Gordon and his\r\npupils lived, which was about half a mile from the school.  They went\r\narm in arm to assure each other a little, for at first in their fright\r\nthey were inclined to take every post and tree for a man in ambush, and\r\nto hear a recalling voice in every sound of cold wind and murmuring\r\nwave.\r\n\r\nNot far from Mr Gordon\'s was a carpenter\'s shop, and outside of this\r\nthere was generally a ladder standing.  They had arranged to carry this\r\nladder with them (as it was only a short one), climb the low garden-wall\r\nwith it, and then place it against the house, immediately under the\r\ndovecot which hung by the first-story windows.  Wildney, as the lightest\r\nof the four, was to take the birds, while the others held the ladder.\r\n\r\nSlanting it so that it should be as far from the side of the window as\r\npossible, Wildney ascended and thrust both hands into the cot.  He\r\nsucceeded in seizing a pigeon with each hand, but in doing so threw the\r\nother birds into a state of such alarm that they fluttered about in the\r\nwildest manner, and the moment his hands were withdrawn, flew out with a\r\ngreat flapping of hurried wings.\r\n\r\nThe noise they made alarmed the plunderer, and he hurried down the\r\nladder as fast as he could.  He handed the pigeons to the others, who\r\ninstantly wrung their necks.\r\n\r\n"I\'m nearly sure I heard somebody stir," said Wildney; "we haven\'t been\r\nhalf quiet enough.  Here! let\'s crouch down in this corner."\r\n\r\nAll four shrank up as close to the wall as they could, and held their\r\nbreath.  Someone was certainly stirring, and at last they heard the\r\nwindow open.\r\n\r\nA head was thrust out, and Mr Gordon\'s voice asked sternly--\r\n\r\n"Who\'s there?"\r\n\r\nHe seemed at once to have caught sight of the ladder, and made an\r\nendeavour to reach it; but though he stretched out his arm at full\r\nlength he could not manage to do so.\r\n\r\n"We must cut for it," said Eric; "it\'s quite too dark for him to see who\r\nwe are, or even to notice that we are boys."\r\n\r\nThey moved the ladder to the wall, and sprang over, one after the other,\r\nas fast as they could.  Eric was last, and just as he got on the top of\r\nthe wall he heard the back door open, and some one run out into the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\n"Run for your lives," said Eric hurriedly; "it\'s Gordon, and he\'s\r\nraising the alarm."\r\n\r\nThey heard footsteps following them, and an occasional shout of\r\n"Thieves! thieves!"\r\n\r\n"We must separate and run different ways, or we\'ve no chance of escape.\r\nWe\'d better turn towards the town to put them off the right scent," said\r\nEric again.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t leave me," pleaded Wildney; "you know I can\'t run very fast."\r\n\r\n"No, Charlie, I won\'t," and grasping his hand, Eric hurried him over the\r\nstile and through the fields as fast as he could, while Pietrie and\r\nGraham took the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nSome one (they did not know who it was, but suspected it to be Mr\r\nGordon\'s servant-man) was running after them, and they could distinctly\r\nhear his footsteps, which seemed to be half a field distant.  He carried\r\na light and they heard him panting.  They were themselves tired, and in\r\nthe utmost trepidation; the usually courageous Wildney was trembling all\r\nover, and his fear communicated itself to Eric.  Horrible visions of a\r\ntrial for burglary, imprisonment in the castle jail, and perhaps\r\ntransportation, presented themselves to their excited imaginations, as\r\nthe sound of the footsteps came nearer and nearer; "I can\'t run any\r\nfarther, Eric," said Wildney.  "What shall we do? don\'t leave me, for\r\nHeaven\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"Not I, Charlie.  We must hide the minute we get t\'other side of this\r\nhedge."\r\n\r\nThey scrambled over the gate, and plunged into the thickest part of a\r\nplantation close by, lying down on the ground behind some bushes, and\r\nkeeping as still as they possibly could, taking care to cover over their\r\nwhite collars.\r\n\r\nThe pursuer reached the gate, and no longer hearing footsteps in front\r\nof him, he paused.  He went a little distance up the hedge on both\r\nsides, and held up his light, but did not detect the cowering boys, and\r\nat last giving up the search in despair, went slowly home.  They heard\r\nhim plodding back over the field, and it was not until the sound of his\r\nfootsteps had died away, that Eric cautiously broke cover, and looked\r\nover the hedge.  He saw the man\'s light gradually getting more distant,\r\nand said, "All right now, Charlie.  We must make the best of our way\r\nhome."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure he\'s gone?" said Wildney, who had not yet recovered from\r\nhis fright.\r\n\r\n"Quite; come along.  I only hope Pietrie and Graham ain\'t caught."\r\n\r\nThey got back about half-past four, and climbed in unheard and\r\nundetected through the window pane.  They then stole upstairs with\r\nbeating hearts, and sate in Eric\'s room to wait for the other two.  To\r\ntheir great relief they heard them enter the lavatory about ten minutes\r\nafter.\r\n\r\n"Were you twigged?" asked Wildney eagerly.\r\n\r\n"No," said Graham; precious near it though.  Old Gordon and some men\r\nwere after us, but at last we doubled rather neatly, and escaped them.\r\nIt\'s all serene, and we shan\'t be caught.  But it\'s a precious long time\r\nbefore I run such a risk again for a brace of rubbishing pigeons.\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'d best to bed now," said Eric; "and to my thinking, we should\r\nbe wise to keep a quiet tongue in our heads about this affair."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we had better tell _no one_."  They agreed, and went off to bed\r\nagain.  So, next morning, they all four got up quite as if nothing had\r\nhappened, and made no allusion to the preceding night, although they\r\ncould not help chuckling inwardly a little when the Gordonites came to\r\nmorning school, brimful of a story about their house having been\r\nattacked in the night by thieves, who after bagging some pigeons, had\r\nbeen chevied by Gordon and the servants.  Wildney professed immense\r\ninterest in the incident, and asked many questions, which showed that\r\nthere was not a shadow of suspicion in any one\'s mind as to the real\r\nculprits.\r\n\r\nCarter, the school-servant, didn\'t seem to have noticed that the\r\nlavatory door was unlocked, and Mr Harley never alluded again to his\r\ndisturbance in the night.  So the theft of the pigeons remained\r\nundiscovered, and remains so till this day.  If any old Roslyn boy reads\r\nthis veracious history, he will doubtless be astounded to hear that the\r\nburglars on that memorable night were Eric, Pietrie, Graham, and\r\nWildney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nSOWING THE WIND.\r\n\r\n  Praepediuntur\r\n  Crura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet mens,\r\n  Nant oculi.\r\n  _Lucretius_, Three, 417.\r\n\r\nNext evening when preparation began, Pietrie and Graham got everything\r\nready for the carouse in their classroom.  Wildney, relying on the\r\nchance of names not being called over (which was only done in case any\r\none\'s absence was observed), had absented himself altogether from the\r\nboarders\' room, and helped busily to spread the table for the banquet.\r\nThe cook had roasted for them the fowls and pigeons, and Billy had\r\nbrought an ample supply of beer and some brandy for the occasion.  A\r\nlittle before eight o\'clock everything was ready, and Eric, Attlay, and\r\nLlewellyn were summoned to join the rest.\r\n\r\nThe fowls, pigeons, and beer had soon vanished, and the boys were in the\r\nhighest spirits.  Eric\'s reckless gaiety was kindled by Wildney\'s\r\nfrolicsome vivacity and Graham\'s sparkling wit; they were all six in a\r\nroar of perpetual laughter at some fresh sally of fun elicited by the\r\nmore phlegmatic natures of Attlay or Llewellyn, and the dainties of\r\nWildney\'s parcel were accompanied by draughts of brandy and water, which\r\nwere sometimes exchanged for potations of the raw liquor.  It was not\r\nthe first time, be it remembered, that the members of that young party\r\nhad been present at similar scenes, and even the scoundrel Billy was\r\nastonished, and occasionally alarmed, at the quantities of spirits and\r\nother inebriating drinks that of late had found their way to the\r\nstudies.  The disgraceful and deadly habit of tippling had already told\r\nphysically on both Eric and Wildney.  The former felt painfully that he\r\nwas losing his clear-headedness, and that his intellectual tastes were\r\ngetting not only blunted but destroyed; and while he perceived in\r\nhimself the terrible effects of his sinful indulgence, he saw them still\r\nmore indisputably in the gradual coarseness which seemed to be\r\nspreading, like a grey lichen, over the countenance, the mind, and the\r\nmanners of his younger companion.  Sometimes the vision of a Nemesis\r\nbreaking in fire out of his darkened future, terrified his guilty\r\nconscience in the watches of the night; and the conviction of some\r\nfearful Erinnys, some discovery dawning out of the night of his\r\nundetected sins, made his heart beat fast with agony and fear.  But he\r\nfancied it too late to repent.  He strangled the half-formed resolutions\r\nas they rose, and trusted to the time when, by leaving school, he should\r\nescape, as he idly supposed, the temptations to which he had yielded.\r\nMeanwhile, the friends who would have rescued him had been alienated by\r\nhis follies, and the principles which might have preserved him had been\r\neradicated by his guilt.  He had long flung away the shield of prayer\r\nand the helmet of holiness, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the\r\nword of God; and now, unarmed and helpless, Eric stood alone, a mark for\r\nthe fiery arrows of his enemies, while, through the weakened inlet of\r\nevery corrupted sense, temptation rushed in upon him perpetually and\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nAs the classroom they had selected was in a remote part of the building,\r\nthere was little immediate chance of detection.  So the laughter of the\r\nparty grew louder and sillier; the talk more foolish and random; the\r\nmerriment more noisy and meaningless.  But still most of them mingled\r\nsome sense of caution with their enjoyment, and warned Eric and Wildney\r\nmore than once that they must look out, and not take too much that night\r\nfor fear of being caught.  But it was Wildney\'s birthday, and Eric\'s\r\nboyish mirth, suppressed by his recent troubles, was blazing out\r\nunrestrained.  In the riot of their feasting the caution had been\r\nutterly neglected, and the two boys were far from being sober when the\r\nsound of the prayer-bell ringing through the great hall startled them\r\ninto momentary consciousness.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" shouted Graham, springing up; "there\'s the prayer-bell;\r\nI\'d no notion it was so late.  Here, let\'s shove these brandy bottles\r\nand things into the cupboards and drawers, and then we must run down."\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose.  The least muddled of the party had cleared\r\nthe room in a moment, and then addressed themselves to the more\r\ndifficult task of trying to quiet Eric and Wildney, and conduct them\r\nsteadily into the prayer-room.\r\n\r\nWildney\'s seat was near the door, so there was little difficulty in\r\ngetting him to his place comparatively unobserved.  Llewellyn took him\r\nby the arm, and after a little stumbling helped him safely to his seat,\r\nwhere he assumed a look of preternatural gravity.  But Eric sat near the\r\nhead of the first table, not far from Dr Rowlands\'s desk, and none of\r\nthe others had to go to that part of the room.  Graham grasped his arm\r\ntight, led him carefully down stairs, and, as they were reaching the\r\ndoor, said to him, in a most earnest and imploring tone--\r\n\r\n"Do try and walk sensibly to your place, Eric, or we shall all be\r\ncaught."\r\n\r\nIt was rather late when they got down.  Everybody was quietly seated,\r\nand most of the Bibles were already open, although the Doctor had not\r\nyet come in.  Consequently, the room was still, and the entrance of\r\nGraham and Eric after the rest attracted general notice.  Eric had just\r\nsense enough to try and assume his ordinary manner; but he was too giddy\r\nwith the fumes of drink to walk straight or act naturally.\r\n\r\nVernon was sitting next to Wright, and stared at his brother with great\r\neyes and open lips.  He was not the only observer.\r\n\r\n"Wright," whispered he in a timid voice; "just see how Eric walks.  What\r\ncan be the matter with him?  Good gracious, he must be ill!" he said,\r\nstarting up, as Eric suddenly made a great stagger to one side, and\r\nnearly fell in the attempt to recover himself.\r\n\r\nWright pulled the little boy down with a firm hand.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" he whispered; "take no notice; he\'s been drinking, Verny, and I\r\nfear he\'ll be caught."\r\n\r\nVernon instantly sat down, and turned deadly pale.  He thought, and he\r\nhad hoped, that since the day at "The Jolly Herring" his brother had\r\nabandoned all such practices, for Eric had been most careful to conceal\r\nfrom him the worst of his failings.  And now he trembled violently with\r\nfear for his discovery, and horror at his disgraceful condition.\r\n\r\nThe sound of Eric\'s unsteady footsteps had made Mr Rose quickly raise\r\nhis head; but at the same moment Duncan hastily made room for the boy on\r\nthe seat beside him, and held out his hand to assist him.  It was not\r\nEric\'s proper place; but Mr Rose, after one long glance of\r\nastonishment, looked down at his book again, and said nothing.\r\n\r\nIt made other hearts besides Vernon\'s ache to see the unhappy boy roll\r\nto his place in that helpless way.\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands came in and prayers commenced.\r\n\r\nWhen they were finished, the names were called, and Eric, instead of\r\nquietly answering his "adsum," as he should have done, stood up, with a\r\nfoolish look, and said, "Yes, sir."  The head-master looked at him for a\r\nminute; the boy\'s glassy eyes and jocosely stupid appearance told an\r\nunmistakable tale; but Dr Rowlands only remarked, "Williams, you don\'t\r\nlook well.  You had better go at once to bed."\r\n\r\nIt was hopeless for Eric to attempt getting along without help so Duncan\r\nat once got up, took him by the arm, and with much difficulty (for Eric\r\nstaggered at every step) conducted him to his bedroom, where he left him\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\nWildney\'s condition was also too evident; and Mr Rose, while walking up\r\nand down the dormitories, had no doubt left on his mind that both Eric\r\nand Wildney had been drinking.  But he made no remarks to them, and\r\nmerely went to the Doctor, to talk over the steps which were to be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n"I shall summon the school," said Dr Rowlands, "on Monday, and by that\r\ntime we will decide on the punishment.  Expulsion, I fear, is the only\r\ncourse open to us."\r\n\r\n"Is not that a _very_ severe line to take?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps; but the offence is of the worst character.  I must consider\r\nthe matter."\r\n\r\n"Poor Williams!" sighed Mr Rose, as he left the room.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the miserable Sunday that followed was spent by Eric and\r\nhis companions in vain inquiries and futile restlessness.  It seemed\r\nclear that two of them at least were detected, and they were\r\ninexpressibly wretched with anxiety and suspense.  Wildney, who had to\r\nstay in bed, was even more depressed; his head ached violently, and he\r\nwas alone with his own terrified thoughts.  He longed for the morrow,\r\nthat at least he might have the poor consolation of knowing his fate.\r\nNo one came near him all day.  Eric wished to do so, but as he could not\r\nhave visited the room without express leave, the rest dissuaded him from\r\nasking, lest he should excite further suspicion.  His apparent neglect\r\nmade poor Wildney even more unhappy, for Wildney loved Eric as much as\r\nit was possible for his volatile mind to love any one; and it seemed\r\nhard to be deserted in the moment of disgrace and sorrow by so close a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nAt school the next morning the various masters read out to their forms a\r\nnotice from Dr Rowlands, that the whole school were to meet at ten in\r\nthe great schoolroom.  The object of the summons was pretty clearly\r\nunderstood; and few boys had any doubt that it had reference to the\r\ndrinking on Saturday night.  Still nothing had been _said_ on the\r\nsubject as yet; and every guilty heart among those 250 boys beat fast\r\nlest _his_ sin too should have been discovered, and he should be called\r\nout for some public and heavy punishment.\r\n\r\nThe hour arrived.  The boys, thronging into the great schoolroom, took\r\ntheir places according to their respective forms.  The masters in their\r\ncaps and gowns were all seated on a small semicircular bench at the\r\nupper end of the room, and in the centre of them, before a small table,\r\nsate Dr Rowlands.\r\n\r\nThe sound of whispering voices sank to a dead and painful hush.  The\r\nblood was tingling consciously in many cheeks, and not even a breath\r\ncould be heard in the deep expectation of that anxious and solemn\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands spread before him the list of the school, and said, "I\r\nshall first read out the names of the boys in the first-fifth and\r\nupper-fourth forms."\r\n\r\nThis was done to ascertain formally whether the boys were present, on\r\nwhose account the meeting was convened; and it at once told Eric and\r\nWildney that _they_ were the boys to be punished, and that the others\r\nhad escaped.\r\n\r\nThe names were called over, and an attentive observer might have told,\r\nfrom the sound of the boys\' voices as they answered, which of them were\r\nafflicted with a troubled conscience.\r\n\r\nAnother slight pause and breathless hush.\r\n\r\n"Eric Williams and Charles Wildney, stand forward."\r\n\r\nThe boys obeyed.  From his place in the fifth, where he was sitting with\r\nhis head propped on his hand, Eric rose and advanced; and Wildney, from\r\nthe other end of the room, where the younger boys sat, getting up, came\r\nand stood by his side.\r\n\r\nBoth of them fixed their eyes on the ground, whence they never once\r\nraised them; and in the deadly pallor of their haggard faces you could\r\nscarcely have recognised the joyous high-spirited friends, whose laugh\r\nand shout had often rung so merrily through the playground, and woke the\r\nechoes of the rocks along the shore.  Every eye was on them, and they\r\nwere conscious of it, though they could not see it--painfully conscious\r\nof it, so that they wished the very ground to yawn beneath their feet\r\nfor the moment and swallow up their shame.  Companionship in disgrace\r\nincreased the suffering; had either of them been alone, he would have\r\nbeen less acutely sensible to the trying nature of his position; but\r\nthat they, so different in their ages and position in the school, should\r\nthus have their friendship and the results of it blazoned, or rather\r\nbranded, before their friends and enemies, added keenly to the misery\r\nthey felt.  So with eyes bent on the floor, Eric and Charlie awaited\r\ntheir sentence.\r\n\r\n"Williams and Wildney," said Dr Rowlands in a solemn voice, of which\r\nevery articulation thrilled to the heart of every hearer, "you have been\r\ndetected in a sin most disgraceful and most dangerous.  On Saturday\r\nnight you were both drinking, and you were guilty of such gross excess,\r\nthat you were neither of you in a fit state to appear among your\r\ncompanions--least of all to appear among them at the hour of prayer.  I\r\nshall not waste many words on an occasion like this; only I trust that\r\nthose of your school-fellows who saw you staggering and rolling into the\r\nroom on Saturday evening in a manner so unspeakably shameful and\r\ndegrading, will learn from that melancholy sight the lesson which the\r\nSpartans taught their children by exhibiting a drunkard before them--the\r\nlesson of the brutalising and fearful character of this most ruinous\r\nvice.  Eric Williams and Charles Wildney, your punishment will be public\r\nexpulsion, for which you will prepare this very evening.  I am unwilling\r\nthat for a single day, either of you--especially the elder of you--\r\nshould linger, so as possibly to contaminate others with the danger of\r\nso pernicious an example."\r\n\r\nSuch a sentence was wholly unexpected; it took boys and masters equally\r\nby surprise.  The announcement of it caused an uneasy sensation, which\r\nwas evident to all present, though no one spoke a word; but Dr Rowlands\r\ntook no notice of it, and only said to the culprits--\r\n\r\n"You may return to your seats."\r\n\r\nThe two boys found their way back instinctively, they hardly knew how.\r\nThey seemed confounded and thunderstruck by their sentence, and the\r\npainful accessories of its publicity.  Eric leaned over the desk with\r\nhis head resting on a book, too stunned even to think; and Wildney\r\nlooked straight before him, with his eyes fixed in a stupid and\r\nunobservant stare.\r\n\r\nForm by form the school dispersed, and the moment he was liberated Eric\r\nsprang away from the boys, who would have spoken to him, and rushed\r\nwildly to his study, where he locked the door.  In a moment, however, he\r\nre-opened it, for he heard Wildney\'s step, and, after admitting him,\r\nlocked it once more.\r\n\r\nWithout a word Wildney, who looked very pale, flung his arms round\r\nEric\'s neck, and, unable to bear up any longer, burst into a flood of\r\ntears.  Both of them felt relief in giving the reins to their sorrow,\r\nand silently satiating the anguish of their hearts.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my father! my father!" sobbed Wildney at length, "what will he say?\r\nHe will disown me, I know; he is so stern always with me when he thinks\r\nI bring disgrace on him."\r\n\r\nEric thought of Fairholm, and of his own far-distant parents, and of the\r\npang which _his_ disgrace would cause their loving hearts; but he could\r\nsay nothing, and only stroked Wildney\'s dark hair again and again with a\r\nsoothing hand.\r\n\r\nThey sat there long, hardly knowing how the time passed; Eric could not\r\nhelp thinking how very very different their relative positions might\r\nhave been; how, while he might have been aiding and ennobling the young\r\nboy beside him, he had alternately led and followed him into wickedness\r\nand disgrace.  His heart was full of misery and bitterness, and he felt\r\nalmost indifferent to all the future, and weary of his life.\r\n\r\nA loud knocking at the door disturbed them.  It was Carter, the\r\nschool-servant.\r\n\r\n"You must pack up to go this evening, young gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"Oh no! no! no!" exclaimed Wildney; "I _cannot_ be sent away like this.\r\nIt would break my father\'s heart.  Eric, _do_ come and entreat Dr\r\nRowlands to forgive us only this once."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Eric, starting up with sudden energy; "he _shall_ forgive\r\nus--_you_ at any rate.  I will not leave him till he does.  Cheer up,\r\nCharlie, cheer up, and come along."\r\n\r\nFilled with an irresistible impulse, he pushed Carter aside, and sprang\r\ndown stairs three steps at a time, with Wildney following him.  They\r\nwent straight for the Doctor\'s study, and without waiting for the answer\r\nto their knock at the door, Eric walked up to Dr Rowlands, who sate\r\nthinking in his arm-chair by the fire, and burst out passionately, "Oh,\r\nsir, forgive us, forgive us this once."\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was completely taken by surprise, so sudden was the\r\nintrusion, and so intense was the boy\'s manner.  He remained silent a\r\nmoment from astonishment, and then said with asperity--\r\n\r\n"Your offence is one of the most dangerous possible.  There could be no\r\nmore perilous example for the school, than the one you have been\r\nsetting, Williams.  Leave the room," he added with an authoritative\r\ngesture; "my mind is made up."\r\n\r\nBut Eric was too excited to be overawed by the master\'s manner; an\r\nimperious passion blinded him to all ordinary considerations, and,\r\nheedless of the command, he broke out again--\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, try me but once, _only_ try me.  I promise you most faithfully\r\nthat I will never again commit the sin.  Oh, sir, do, do trust me, and I\r\nwill be responsible for Wildney too."\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands, seeing that in Eric\'s present mood he must and would be\r\nheard, unless he were ejected by actual force, began to pace silently up\r\nand down the room in perplexed and anxious thought; at last he stopped\r\nand turned over the pages of a thick school register, and found Eric\'s\r\nname.\r\n\r\n"It is not your first offence, Williams, even of this very kind.  That\r\nmost seriously aggravates your fault."\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir! give us one more chance to mend.  Oh, I feel that I _could_ do\r\nsuch great things, if you will but be merciful, and give me time to\r\nchange.  Oh, I entreat you, sir, to forgive us only this once, and I\r\nwill never ask again.  Let us bear _any_ other punishment but this.  Oh,\r\nsir," he said, approaching the Doctor in an imploring attitude, "spare\r\nus this one time for the sake of our friends."\r\n\r\nThe head-master made no reply for a time, but again paced the room in\r\nsilence.  He was touched, and seemed hardly able to restrain his\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n"It was my deliberate conclusion to expel you, Williams.  I must not\r\nweakly yield to entreaty.  You must go."\r\n\r\nEric wrung his hands in agony.  "Oh, sir, then if you must do so, expel\r\nme only, and not Charlie.  _I_ can bear it, but do not let me ruin him\r\nalso.  Oh, I implore you, sir, for the love of God, do, do forgive him!\r\nIt is I who have misled him," and he flung himself on his knees, and\r\nlifted his hands entreatingly towards the Doctor.\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands looked at him--at his blue eyes drowned with tears, his\r\nagitated gesture, his pale, expressive face, full of passionate\r\nsupplication.  He looked at Wildney too, who stood trembling with a look\r\nof painful and miserable suspense, and occasionally added his wild word\r\nof entreaty, or uttered sobs more powerful still, that seemed to come\r\nfrom the depth of his heart.  He was shaken in his resolve, wavered for\r\na moment, and then once more looked at the register.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he said, after a long pause, "here is an entry which shall save\r\nyou this time.  I find written here against your name, `April 3.  Risked\r\nhis life in the endeavour to save Edwin Russell at the Stack.\'  That one\r\ngood and noble deed shall be the proof that you are capable of better\r\nthings.  It may be weak perhaps--I know that it will be called weak--and\r\nI do not feel certain that I am doing right; but if I err it shall be on\r\nthe side of mercy.  I shall change expulsion into some other punishment.\r\nYou may go."\r\n\r\nWildney\'s face lighted up as suddenly and joyously as when a ray of\r\nsunlight gleams for an instant out of a dark cloud.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you, thank you, sir," he exclaimed, drying his eyes, and\r\npouring into the words a world of expression, which it was no light\r\npleasure to have heard.  But Eric spoke less impulsively, and while the\r\ntwo boys were stammering out their deep gratitude, a timid hand knocked\r\nat the door, and Vernon entered.\r\n\r\n"I have come, sir, to speak for poor Eric," he said in a voice low and\r\ntrembling with emotion, as, with downcast eyes, he modestly approached\r\ntowards Dr Rowlands, not even observing the presence of the others in\r\nthe complete absorption of his feelings.  He stood in a sorrowful\r\nattitude, not venturing to look up, and his hand played nervously with\r\nthe ribbon of his straw hat.\r\n\r\n"I have just forgiven him, my little boy," said the Doctor kindly,\r\npatting his stooping head; "there he is, and he has been speaking for\r\nhimself."\r\n\r\n"O Eric, I am so, so glad, I don\'t know what to say for joy.  O Eric,\r\nthank God that you are not to be expelled," and Vernon went to his\r\nbrother and embraced him with the deepest affection.\r\n\r\nDr Rowlands watched the scene with moist eyes.  He was generally a man\r\nof prompt decision, and he well knew that he would incur by this act the\r\ncharge of vacillation.  It was a noble self-denial in him to be willing\r\nto do so, but it would have required an iron heart to resist such\r\nearnest supplications, and he was more than repaid when he saw how much\r\nanguish he had removed by yielding to their entreaties.\r\n\r\nOnce more humbly expressing their gratitude, the boys retired.\r\n\r\nThey did not know that other influences had been also exerted in their\r\nfavour, which, although ineffectual at the time, had tended to alter the\r\nDoctor\'s intention.  Immediately after school Mr Rose had been strongly\r\nendeavouring to change the Doctor\'s mind, and had dwelt forcibly on all\r\nthe good points in Eric\'s character, and the promise of his earlier\r\ncareer.  And Montagu had gone with Owen and Duncan to beg that the\r\nexpulsion might be commuted into some other punishment.  They had failed\r\nto convince him; but perhaps, had they not thus exerted themselves, Dr\r\nRowlands might have been unshaken, though he could not be unmoved, by\r\nVernon\'s gentle intercession and Eric\'s passionate prayers.\r\n\r\nWildney, full of joy, and excited by the sudden revulsion of feeling,\r\nonly shook Eric\'s hands with all his might, and then darted out into the\r\nplayground to announce the happy news.  The boys all flocked round him,\r\nand received the intelligence with unmitigated pleasure.  Among them all\r\nthere was not one who did not rejoice that Eric and Wildney were yet to\r\ncontinue of their number.\r\n\r\nBut the two brothers returned to the study, and there, sorrowful in his\r\npenitence, with his heart still aching with remorse, Eric sat down on a\r\nchair facing the window, and drew Vernon to his side.  The sun was\r\nsetting behind the purple hills, flooding the green fields and silver\r\nsea with the crimson of his parting rays.  The air was full of peace and\r\ncoolness, and the merry sounds of the cricket-field blended joyously\r\nwith the whisper of the evening breeze.  Eric was fond of beauty in\r\nevery shape, and his father had early taught him a keen appreciation of\r\nthe glories of nature.  He had often gazed before on that splendid\r\nscene, as he was now gazing on it thoughtfully with his brother by his\r\nside.  He looked long and wistfully at the gorgeous pageantry of quiet\r\nclouds, and passed his arm more fondly round Vernon\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of, Eric?  Why, I declare, you are crying still,"\r\nsaid Vernon playfully, as he wiped away a tear which had overflowed on\r\nhis brother\'s cheek; "aren\'t you glad that the Doctor has forgiven you?"\r\n\r\n"Gladder, far gladder than I can say, Verny.  O Verny, Verny, I hope\r\nyour school-life may be happier than mine has been.  I would give up all\r\nI have, Verny, to have kept free from the sins I have learnt.  God grant\r\nthat I may yet have time and space to do better."\r\n\r\n"Let us pray together, Eric," whispered his brother reverently, and they\r\nknelt down and prayed; they prayed for their distant parents and\r\nfriends; they prayed for their school-fellows and for each other, and\r\nfor Wildney, and they thanked God for all His goodness to them; and then\r\nEric poured out his heart in a fervent prayer that a holier and happier\r\nfuture might atone for his desecrated past, and that his sins might be\r\nforgiven for his Saviour\'s sake.\r\n\r\nThe brothers rose from their knees calmer and more light-hearted in the\r\nbeauty of holiness, and gave each other a solemn affectionate kiss,\r\nbefore they went down again to the playground.  But they avoided the\r\nrest of the boys, and took a stroll together along the sands, talking\r\nquietly and happily, and hoping bright hopes for future days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nWHOM THE GODS LOVE DIE YOUNG.\r\n\r\n  Oh is it weed, or fish, or floating hair?\r\n  A tress of maiden\'s hair,\r\n  Of drowned maiden\'s hair,\r\n  Above the nets at sea!\r\n  _Kingsley_.\r\n\r\nEric and Wildney were flogged and confined to gates for a time instead\r\nof being expelled, and they both bore the punishment in a manly and\r\npenitent way, and set themselves with all their might to repair the\r\ninjury which their characters had received.  Eric especially seemed to\r\nbe devoting himself with every energy to regain, if possible, his\r\nlong-lost position, and by the altered complexion of his remaining\r\nschool-life, to atone in some poor measure for its earlier sins.  And he\r\ncarried Wildney with him, influencing others also of his late companions\r\nin a greater or less degree.  It was not Eric\'s nature to do things by\r\nhalves, and it became obvious to all that his exertions to resist and\r\nabandon his old temptations were strenuous and unwavering.  He could no\r\nlonger hope for the school distinctions, which would have once lain so\r\neasily within his reach, for the ground lost during weeks of idleness\r\ncannot be recovered by a wish; but he succeeded sufficiently, by dint of\r\ndesperately hard work, to acquit himself with considerable credit, and\r\nin the Easter examination came out high enough in the upper fifth to\r\nsecure his remove into the sixth-form after the holidays.\r\n\r\nHe felt far happier in the endeavour to do his duty, than he had ever\r\ndone during the last years of recklessness and neglect, and the change\r\nfor the better in his character tended to restore unanimity and goodwill\r\nto the school.  Eric no longer headed the party which made a point of\r\nridiculing and preventing industry; and sharing as he did the sympathy\r\nof nearly all the boys, he was able quietly and unobtrusively to calm\r\ndown the jealousies and allay the heart-burnings which had for so long a\r\ntime brought discord and disunion into the school society.  Cheerfulness\r\nand unanimity began to prevail once more at Roslyn, and Eric had the\r\nintense happiness of seeing how much good lay still within his power.\r\n\r\nSo the Easter holidays commenced with promise, and the few first days\r\nglided away in innocent enjoyments.  Eric was now reconciled again to\r\nOwen and Duncan, and, therefore, had a wider choice of companions more\r\ntruly congenial to his higher nature than the narrow circle of his late\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\n"What do you say to a boat excursion to-morrow?" asked Duncan as they\r\nchatted together one evening.\r\n\r\n"I won\'t go without leave," said Eric; "I should only get caught, and\r\nget into another mess.  Besides, I feel myself pledged now to strict\r\nobedience."\r\n\r\n"Ay, you\'re quite right.  We\'ll get leave easily enough though, provided\r\nwe agree to take Jim the boatman with us; so I vote we make up a party."\r\n\r\n"By the bye, I forgot; I\'m engaged to Wildney to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Never mind.  Bring him with you, and Graham too, if you like."\r\n\r\n"Most gladly," said Eric, really pleased; for he saw by this that Duncan\r\nobserved the improvement in his old friends, and was falling in with the\r\nendeavour to make all the boys really cordial to each other, and destroy\r\nall traces of the late factions.\r\n\r\n"Do you mind my bringing Montagu?"\r\n\r\n"Not at all.  Why should I?" answered Eric, with a slight blush.\r\nMontagu and he had never been formally reconciled, nor had they, as yet,\r\nspoken to each other.  Indeed, Duncan had purposely planned the\r\nexcursion to give them an opportunity of becoming friends once more, by\r\nbeing thrown together.  He knew well that they both earnestly wished it,\r\nalthough, with the natural shyness of boys, they hardly knew how to set\r\nabout effecting it.  Montagu hung back lest he should seem to be\r\npatronising a fallen enemy, and Eric lest he should have sinned too\r\ndeeply to be forgiven.\r\n\r\nThe next morning dawned gloriously, and it was agreed that they should\r\nmeet at Starhaven, the point where they were to get the boat, at ten\r\no\'clock.  As they had supposed, Dr Rowlands gave a ready consent to the\r\nrow, on condition of their being accompanied by the experienced sailor\r\nwhom the boys called Jim.  The precaution was by no means unnecessary,\r\nfor the various currents which ran round the island were violent at\r\ncertain stages of the tide, and extremely dangerous for any who were not\r\naware of their general course.\r\n\r\nFeeling that the day would pass off very unpleasantly if any feeling of\r\nrestraint remained between him and Montagu, Eric, by a strong effort,\r\ndetermined to `make up with him\' before starting, and went into his\r\nstudy for that purpose after breakfast.  Directly he came in, Montagu\r\njumped up and welcomed him cordially, and when without any allusion to\r\nthe past, the two shook hands with all warmth, and looked the old proud\r\nlook into each other\'s faces, they felt once more that their former\r\naffection was unimpaired, and that in heart they were real and loving\r\nfriends.  Most keenly did they both enjoy the renewed intercourse, and\r\nthey found endless subjects to talk about on their way to Starhaven,\r\nwhere the others were already assembled when they came.\r\n\r\nWith Jim\'s assistance they shoved a boat into the water, and sprang into\r\nit in the highest spirits.  Just as they were pushing off they saw\r\nWright and Vernon running down to the shore towards them, and they\r\nwaited to see what they wanted.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you take us with you?" asked Vernon, breathless with his run.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not, Verny," said Montagu; "the boat won\'t hold more than\r\nsix, will it, Jim?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir, not safely."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, you shall have my place, Verny," said Eric, as he saw his\r\nbrother\'s disappointed look.\r\n\r\n"Then Wright shall take mine," said Wildney.\r\n\r\n"Oh dear, no," said Wright, "we wouldn\'t turn you out for the world.\r\nVernon and I will take an immense walk down the coast instead, and will\r\nmeet you here as we come back."\r\n\r\n"Well, good-bye, then; off we go;" and with light hearts the boaters and\r\nthe pedestrians parted.\r\n\r\nEric, Graham, Duncan, and Montagu took the first turn at the oars, while\r\nWildney steered.  Graham\'s "crabs," and Wildney\'s rather crooked\r\nsteering, gave plenty of opportunity for chaff, and they were full of\r\nfun, as the oar-blades splashed and sparkled in the waves.  Then they\r\nmade Jim sing them some of his old sailor-songs as they rowed, and\r\njoined vigorously in the choruses.  They had arranged to make straight\r\nfor Saint Catharine\'s Head, and land somewhere near it to choose a place\r\nfor their picnic.  It took them nearly two hours to get there, as they\r\nrowed leisurely, and enjoyed the luxury of the vernal air.  It was one\r\nof the sunniest days of early spring; the air was pure and delicious,\r\nand the calm sea-breeze, just strong enough to make the sea flame and\r\nglister in the warm sunlight, was exhilarating as new wine.  Underneath\r\nthem the water was transparent as crystal, and far below they could see\r\nthe green and purple seaweeds rising like a many-coloured wood, through\r\nwhich occasionally they saw a fish, startled by their oars, dart like an\r\narrow.  The sky overhead was a cloudless blue, and as they kept not far\r\nfrom shore, the clearly cut outline of the coast, with its rocks and\r\nhills standing out in the vivid atmosphere, made a glowing picture, to\r\nwhich the golden green of the spring herbage, bathed in its morning\r\nsunlight, lent the magic of enchantment.  Who could have been otherwise\r\nthan happy in such a scene and at such a time? but these were boys with\r\nthe long bright holiday before them, and happiness is almost too quiet a\r\nword to express the bounding exultation of heart, the royal and tingling\r\nsense of vigorous life, which made them shout and sing, as their boat\r\nrustled through the ripples, from a mere instinct of inexpressible\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nThey had each contributed some luxury to the picnic, and it made a very\r\ntempting display as they spread it out under a sunny pebbled cave, by\r\nSaint Catharine\'s Head; although instead of anything more objectionable,\r\nthey had thought it best to content themselves with ginger beer and\r\nlemonade.  When they had done eating, they amused themselves on the\r\nshore; and had magnificent games among the rocks, and in every fantastic\r\nnook of the romantic promontory.  And then Eric suggested a bathe to\r\nwind up with, as it was the first day when it had been quite warm enough\r\nto make bathing pleasant.\r\n\r\n"But we\'ve got no towels."\r\n\r\n"Oh! chance the towels.  We can run about till we\'re dry."  So they\r\nbathed, and then getting in the boat to row back again, they all agreed\r\nthat it was the very jolliest day they\'d ever had at Roslyn, and voted\r\nto renew the experiment before the holidays were over, and take Wright\r\nand Vernon with them in a larger boat.\r\n\r\nIt was afternoon--an afternoon still warm and beautiful--when they began\r\nto row home; so they took it quietly, and kept near the land for\r\nvariety\'s sake, laughing, joking, and talking as merrily as ever.\r\n\r\n"I declare I think this is the prettiest, or anyhow the grandest bit of\r\nthe whole coast," said Eric, as they neared a glen through whose narrow\r\ngorge a green and garrulous little river gambolled down with noisy\r\nturbulence into the sea.  He might well admire that glen; its steep and\r\nrugged sides were veiled with lichens, moss, and wild-flowers, and the\r\nsea-birds found safe refuge in its lonely windings, which were coloured\r\nwith topaz and emerald by the pencillings of nature and the rich stains\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Montagu, "_I_ always stick up for Avon Glen as the\r\nfinest scene we\'ve got about here.  But, I say, who\'s that gesticulating\r\non the rock there to the right of it?  I verily believe it\'s Wright,\r\napostrophising the ocean for Vernon\'s benefit.  I only see one of them\r\nthough."\r\n\r\n"I bet you he\'s spouting:--\r\n\r\n  "Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll\r\n  Ten thousand fleets, etcetera."\r\n\r\nsaid Graham, laughing.\r\n\r\n"What do you say to putting in to shore there?" said Duncan.  "It\'s only\r\ntwo miles to Starhaven, and I daresay we could make shift to take them\r\nin for that distance.  If Jim says anything we\'ll chuck him overboard."\r\n\r\nThey rowed towards Avon Glen, and to their surprise Wright, who stood\r\nthere alone (for with a pocket telescope they clearly made out that it\r\n_was_ Wright), still continued to wave his arms and beckon them in a\r\nmanner which they at first thought ridiculous, but which soon made them\r\nfeel rather uneasy.\r\n\r\nJim took an oar, and they soon got within two hundred yards of the\r\nbeach.  Wright had ceased to make signals, but appeared to be shouting\r\nto them, and pointing towards one corner of the glen; but though they\r\ncaught the sound of his voice, they could not hear what he said.\r\n\r\n"I wonder why Vernon isn\'t with him," said Eric anxiously; "I hope--why,\r\nwhat _are_ you looking at, Charlie?"\r\n\r\n"What\'s that in the water there?" said Wildney, pointing in the\r\ndirection to which Wright was also looking.\r\n\r\nMontagu snatched the telescope out of his hand and looked.  "Good God!"\r\nhe exclaimed, turning pale; "what can be the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, _do_ let me look," said Eric.\r\n\r\n"No! stop, stop, Eric; you\'d better not, I think; pray don\'t, it may be\r\nall a mistake.  You\'d better not--but it looked--nay, you really\r\n_mustn\'t_, Eric," he said, and, as if accidentally, he let the telescope\r\nfall into the water, and they saw it sink down among the seaweeds at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nEric looked at him reproachfully.  "What\'s the fun of that, Monty? you\r\nlet it drop on purpose."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind; I\'ll get Wildney another.  I really daren\'t let you\r\nlook, for fear you should _fancy_ the same as I did, for it must be\r\nfancy.  Oh, _don\'t_ let us put in there--at least not all of us."\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ that thing in the water?\r\n\r\nWhen Wright and Vernon left the others, they walked along the coast,\r\nfollowing the direction of the boat, and agreed to amuse themselves in\r\ncollecting eggs.  They were very successful, and, to their great\r\ndelight, managed to secure some rather rare specimens.  When they had\r\ntired themselves with this pursuit, they lay on the summit of one of the\r\ncliffs which formed the sides of Avon Glen, and Wright, who was very\r\nfond of poetry, read Vernon a canto of _Marmion_ with great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nSo they wiled away the morning, and when the canto was over, Vernon took\r\na great stone and rolled it for amusement over the cliff\'s edge.  It\r\nthundered over the side, bounding down till it reached the strand, and a\r\nlarge black cormorant, startled by the reverberating echoes, rose up\r\nsuddenly, and flapped its way with protruded neck to a rock on the\r\nfarther side of the little bay.\r\n\r\n"I bet you that animal\'s got a nest somewhere near here," said Vernon\r\neagerly.  "Come, let\'s have a look for it; a cormorant\'s egg would be a\r\njolly addition to our collection."\r\n\r\nThey got up, and looking down the face of the cliff saw, some eight feet\r\nbelow them, a projection half hidden by the branch of a tree, on which\r\nthe scattered pieces of stick clearly showed the existence of a rude\r\nnest.  They could not, however, see whether it contained eggs or no.\r\n\r\n"I must bag that nest; it\'s pretty sure to have eggs in it," said\r\nVernon, "and I can get at it easy enough."\r\n\r\nHe immediately began to descend towards the place where the nest was\r\nbuilt, but he found it harder than he expected.\r\n\r\n"Hallo," he said, "this is a failure.  I must climb up again to\r\nreconnoitre if there isn\'t a better dodge for getting at it."\r\n\r\nHe reached the top, and, looking down, saw a plan of reaching the ledge\r\nwhich promised more hope of success.\r\n\r\n"You\'d better give it up, Verny," said Wright.  "I\'m sure it\'s harder\r\nthan we fancied.  _I_ couldn\'t manage it, I know."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, Wright, never say die.  Look; if I get down more toward the\r\nright the way\'s plain enough, and I shall have reached the nest in no\r\ntime."\r\n\r\nAgain he descended in a different direction, but again he failed.  The\r\nnest could only be seen from the top, and he lost the proper route.\r\n\r\n"You must keep more to the right."\r\n\r\n"I know," answered Vernon; "but, bother take it, I can\'t manage it, now\r\nI\'m so far down.  I must climb up _again_."\r\n\r\n"_Do_ give it up, Verny, there\'s a good fellow.  You _can\'t_ reach it,\r\nand really it\'s dangerous."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, not a bit of it.  My head\'s very steady and I feel as cool as\r\npossible.  We mustn\'t give up; I\'ve only to get at the tree, and then I\r\nshall be able to reach the nest from it quite easily."\r\n\r\n"Well, do take care, that\'s a dear fellow."\r\n\r\n"Never fear," said Vernon, who was already commencing his third attempt.\r\n\r\nThis time he got to the tree, and placed his foot on a part of the root,\r\nwhile with his hands he clung on to a clump of heather.\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!" he cried, "it\'s got two eggs in it, Wright," and he stretched\r\ndownwards to take them.  Just as he was doing so, he heard the root on\r\nwhich his foot rested give a great crack, and with a violent start he\r\nmade a spring for one of the lower branches.  The motion caused his\r\nwhole weight to rest for an instant on his arms; unable to sustain the\r\nwrench, the heather gave way, and with a wild shriek he fell headlong\r\ndown the surface of the cliff.\r\n\r\nWith a wild shriek!--but silence followed it.\r\n\r\n"Vernon!  Vernon!" shouted the terrified Wright, creeping close up to\r\nthe edge of the precipice.  "O Vernon! for Heaven\'s sake, speak."\r\n\r\nThere was no answer, and leaning over, Wright saw the young boy\r\noutstretched on the stones three hundred feet below.  For some minutes\r\nhe was horror-struck beyond expression, and made wild attempts to\r\ndescend the cliff and reach him.  But he soon gave up the attempt in\r\ndespair.  There was a tradition in the school that the feat had once\r\nbeen accomplished by an adventurous and active boy, but Wright at any\r\nrate found it hopeless for himself.  The only other way to reach the\r\nglen was by a circuitous route which led to the entrance of the narrow\r\ngorge, along the sides of which it was possible to make way with\r\ndifficulty down the bank of the river to the place where it met the sea.\r\nBut this would have taken him an hour and a half, and was far from easy\r\nwhen the river was swollen with high tide.  There was no house within\r\nmoderate distance at which assistance could be procured, and Wright, in\r\na tumult of conflicting emotions, determined to wait where he was, on\r\nthe chance of seeing the boat as it returned from Saint Catharine\'s\r\nHead.  It was already three o\'clock, and he knew that the boys could not\r\nnow be longer than an hour at most; so with eager eyes he sat watching\r\nthe headland, round which he knew they would first come in sight.  He\r\nwatched with wild eager eyes, absorbed in the one longing desire to\r\ncatch sight of them; but the leaden-footed moments crawled on like\r\nhours, and he could not help shivering with agony and fear.  At last he\r\ncaught a glimpse of them, and springing up, began to shout at the top of\r\nhis voice, and wave his handkerchief and his arms in the hope of\r\nattracting their attention.  Little thought those blithe, merry-hearted\r\nboys, in the midst of the happy laughter which they sent ringing over\r\nthe waters, little they thought how terrible a tragedy awaited them.\r\n\r\nAt last Wright saw that they had perceived him, and were putting inland,\r\nand now, in his fright, he hardly knew what to do; but feeling sure that\r\nthey could not fail to see Vernon, he ran off as fast as he could to\r\nStarhaven, where he rapidly told the people at a farmhouse what had\r\nhappened, and asked them to get a cart ready to convey the wounded boy\r\nto Roslyn School.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the tide rolled in calmly and quietly in the rosy evening,\r\nradiant with the diamond and gold of reflected sunlight and transparent\r\nwave.  Gradually, gently it crept up to the place where Vernon lay; and\r\nthe little ripples fell over him wonderingly, with the low murmur of\r\ntheir musical laughter, and blurred and dimmed the vivid splashes and\r\ncrimson streaks upon the white stone, on which his head had fallen; and\r\nwashed away some of the purple bells and green sprigs of heather round\r\nwhich his fingers were closed in the grasp of death, and played softly\r\nwith his fair hair as it rose, and fell, and floated on their\r\nundulations like a leaf of golden-coloured weed, until they themselves\r\nwere faintly discoloured by his blood.  And then, tired with their new\r\nplaything, they passed on, until the swelling of the water was just\r\nstrong enough to move rudely the boy\'s light weight, and in a few\r\nmoments more would have tossed it up and down with every careless wave\r\namong the boulders of the glen.  And then it was that Montagu\'s\r\nhorror-stricken gaze had identified the object at which they had been\r\ngazing.  In strange foreboding silence they urged on the boat, while\r\nEric at the prow seemed wild with the one intense impulse to verify his\r\nhorrible suspicion.  The suspicion grew and grew:--it _was_ a boy lying\r\nin the water;--it was Vernon;--he was motionless;--he must have fallen\r\nthere from the cliff.\r\n\r\nEric could endure the suspense no longer.  The instant that the boat\r\ngrated on the shingle, he sprang into the water, and rushed to the spot\r\nwhere his brother\'s body lay.  With a burst of passionate affection, he\r\nflung himself on his knees beside it, and took the cold hand in his\r\nown--the little rigid hand in which the green blades of grass, and fern,\r\nand heath, so tightly clutched, were unconscious of the tale they told.\r\n\r\n"O Verny, Verny, darling Verny, speak to me!" he cried in anguish, as he\r\ntenderly lifted up the body, and marked how little blood had flowed.\r\nBut the child\'s head fell back heavily, and his arms hung motionlessly\r\nbeside him, and with a shriek, Eric suddenly caught the look of dead\r\nfixity in his blue open eyes.\r\n\r\nThe others had come up.  "O God, save my brother, save him, save him\r\nfrom death," cried Eric.  "I cannot live without him.  O God!  O God!\r\nLook! look!" he continued, "he has fallen from the cliff with his head\r\non this cursed stone," pointing to the block of quartz, still red with\r\nblood-stained hair; "but we must get a doctor.  He is not dead! no, no,\r\nhe _cannot_ be dead.  Take him quickly, and let us row home.  O God! why\r\ndid I ever leave him?"\r\n\r\nThe boys drew round in a frightened circle, and lifted Vernon\'s corpse\r\ninto the boat; and then, while Eric still supported the body, and\r\nmoaned, and called to him in anguish, and chafed his cold pale brow and\r\nwhite hands, and kept saying that he had fainted and was not dead, the\r\nothers rowed home with all speed, while a feeling of terrified anxiety\r\nlay like frost upon their hearts.\r\n\r\nThey reached Starhaven, and lifted the lifeless boy into the cart, and\r\nheard from Wright how the accident had taken place.  Few boys were about\r\nthe playground, so they got unnoticed to Roslyn, and Dr Underhay, who\r\nhad been summoned, was instantly in attendance.  He looked at Vernon for\r\na moment, and then shook his head in a way that could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\nEric saw it, and flung himself with uncontrollable agony on his\r\nbrother\'s corpse.  "O Vernon, Vernon, my own darling brother!  O God,\r\nthen he is dead!"  And, unable to endure the blow, he fainted away.\r\n\r\nI cannot dwell on the miserable days that followed when the very sun in\r\nheaven seemed dark to poor Eric\'s wounded and crushed spirit.  He hardly\r\nknew how they went by.  And when they buried Vernon in the little green\r\nchurchyard by Russell\'s side, and the patter of the earth upon the\r\ncoffin--that most terrible of all sounds--struck his ear, the iron\r\nentered into his soul, and he had but one wish as he turned away from\r\nthe open grave, and that was, soon to lie beside his beloved little\r\nbrother, and to be at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST TEMPTATION.\r\n\r\nA quotation from Homer\'s Iliad, ix. 505.\r\n\r\nTime, the great good angel, Time, the merciful healer, assuaged the\r\nviolence of Eric\'s grief, which seemed likely to settle down into a\r\nsober sadness.  At first his letters to his parents and to Fairholm were\r\nalmost unintelligible in their fierce abandonment of sorrow; but they\r\ngrew calmer in time,--and while none of his school-fellows ever ventured\r\nin his presence to allude to Vernon, because of the emotion which the\r\nslightest mention of him excited, yet he rarely wrote any letters to his\r\nrelations in which he did not refer to his brother\'s death, in language\r\nwhich grew at length both manly and resigned.\r\n\r\nA month after, in the summer term, he was sitting alone in his study in\r\nthe afternoon (for he could not summon up spirit enough to play\r\nregularly at cricket), writing a long letter to his aunt.  He spoke\r\nfreely and unreservedly of his past errors,--more freely than he had\r\never done before,--and expressed not only deep penitence, but even\r\nstrong hatred of his previous unworthy courses.  "I can hardly even yet\r\nrealise," he added, "that I am alone here, and that I am writing to my\r\naunt Trevor about the death of my little brother, my noble, only\r\nbrother, Vernon.  Oh, how my whole soul yearns towards him.  I _must_ be\r\na better boy, I _will_ be better than I have been, in the hopes of\r\nmeeting him again.  Indeed, indeed, dear aunt, though I have been so\r\nguilty, I am laying aside, with all my might, idleness and all bad\r\nhabits, and doing my very best to redeem the lost years.  I do hope that\r\nthe rest of my time at Roslyn will be more worthily spent than any of it\r\nhas been as yet."\r\n\r\nHe finished the sentence, and laid his pen down to think, gazing quietly\r\non the blue hills and sunlit sea.  A feeling of hope and repose stole\r\nover him;--when suddenly he saw at the door, which was ajar, the leering\r\neyes and villainously cunning countenance of Billy.\r\n\r\n"What do you want?" he said angrily, casting at the intruder a look of\r\nintense disgust.\r\n\r\n"Beg pardon, sir," said the man, pulling his hair.  "Anything in my\r\nline, sir, to-day?"\r\n\r\n"No!" answered Eric, rising up in a gust of indignation.  "What business\r\nhave you here?  Get away instantly."\r\n\r\n"Not had much custom from you lately, sir," said the man.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by having the insolence to begin talking to me?  If\r\nyou don\'t make yourself scarce at once, I\'ll--"\r\n\r\n"Oh well," said the man; "if it comes to that, I\'ve business enough.\r\nPerhaps you\'ll just pay me this debt," he continued, changing his\r\nfawning manner into a bullying swagger.  "I\'ve waited long enough."\r\n\r\nEric, greatly discomfited, took the dirty bit of paper.  It purported to\r\nbe a bill for various items of drink, all of which Eric _knew_ to have\r\nbeen paid for, and among other things, a charge of 6 pounds for the\r\ndinner at "The Jolly Herring."\r\n\r\n"Why, you scoundrel, these have all been paid.  What! six pounds for the\r\ndinner!  Why, Brigson collected the subscriptions to pay for it before\r\nit took place."\r\n\r\n"That\'s now\'t to me, sir.  He never paid me; and as you was the young\r\ngen\'leman in the cheer, I comes to you."\r\n\r\n_Now_ Eric knew for the first time what Brigson had meant by his\r\nthreatened revenge.  He saw at once that the man had been put up to act\r\nin this way by some one, and had little doubt that Brigson was the\r\ninstigator.  Perhaps it might be even true, as the man said, that he had\r\nnever received the money.  Brigson was quite wicked enough to have\r\nembezzled it for his own purposes.\r\n\r\n"Go," he said to the man; "you shall have the money in a week."\r\n\r\n"And mind it bean\'t more nor a week.  I don\'t chuse to wait for my money\r\nno more," said Billy impudently, as he retired with an undisguised\r\nchuckle, which very nearly made Eric kick him down stairs.  With a\r\nheart-rending sigh Eric folded and directed his letter to Mrs Trevor,\r\nand then ran out into the fresh air to relieve the qualm of sickness\r\nwhich had come over him.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done?  To mention the subject to Owen or Montagu, who\r\nwere best capable of advising him, would have been to renew the memory\r\nof unpleasant incidents, which he was most anxious to obliterate from\r\nthe memory of all.  He had not the moral courage to face the natural\r\nconsequences of his past misconduct, and was now ashamed to speak of\r\nwhat he had not then been ashamed to do.  He told Graham and Wildney,\r\nwho were the best of his old associates, and they at once agreed that\r\nthey ought to be responsible for at least a share of the debt.  Still,\r\nbetween them they could only muster three pounds out of the six which\r\nwere required, and the week had half elapsed before there seemed any\r\nprospect of extrication from the difficulty; so Eric daily grew more\r\nmiserable and dejected.\r\n\r\nA happy thought struck him.  He would go and explain the source of his\r\ntrouble to Mr Rose, his oldest, his kindest, his wisest friend.  To him\r\nhe could speak without scruple and without reserve, and from him he knew\r\nthat he would receive nothing but the noblest advice and the warmest\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nHe went to him after prayers that night, and told his story.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Eric, Eric!" said Mr Rose; "you see, my boy, that sin and\r\npunishment are twins."\r\n\r\n"Oh but, sir, I was just striving so hard to amend, and it seems cruel\r\nthat I should be checked at once."\r\n\r\n"Let it teach you a life-long lesson, dear Eric;--the lesson that when a\r\nsin is committed _we_ may have done with _it_, but _it_ has by no means\r\ndone with _us_.  It is always so, Eric when we drink the wine it is red\r\nand sparkling, but we come afterwards to the ragged and bitter dregs."\r\n\r\n"But what shall I do, sir?" said Eric sadly.\r\n\r\n"There is only one way that I see, Eric.  You must write home for the\r\nmoney, and confess the truth to them honestly, as you have to me."\r\n\r\nIt was a hard course for Eric\'s proud and loving heart to write and tell\r\nhis aunt the full extent of his guilt.  But he did it faithfully,\r\nextenuating nothing, and entreating her, as she loved him, to send the\r\nmoney by return of post.\r\n\r\nIt came, and with it a letter full of deep and gentle affection.  Mrs\r\nTrevor knew her nephew\'s character, and did not add by reproaches to the\r\nbitterness which she perceived he had endured; she simply sent him the\r\nmoney, and told him, that in spite of his many failures, "she still had\r\nperfect confidence in the true heart of her dear boy."\r\n\r\nTouched by the affection which all seemed to be showing him, it became\r\nmore and more the passionate craving of Eric\'s soul to be worthy of that\r\nlove.  But it is far far harder to recover a lost path than to keep in\r\nthe right one all along; and by one more terrible fall the poor erring\r\nboy was to be taught for the last time the fearful strength of\r\ntemptation, and the only source in earth and heaven from which\r\ndeliverance can come.  Theoretically he knew it, but as yet not\r\npractically.  Great as his trials had been, and deeply as he had\r\nsuffered, it was God\'s will that he should pass through a yet fiercer\r\nflame ere he could be purified from pride and passion and\r\nself-confidence, and led to the cross of a suffering Saviour, there to\r\nfling himself down in heart-rending humility, and cast his great load of\r\ncares and sins upon Him who cared for him through all his wanderings,\r\nand was leading him back through thorny places to the green pastures and\r\nstill waters, where at last he might have rest.\r\n\r\nThe money came, and walking off straight to "The Jolly Herring," he\r\ndashed it down on the table before Billy, and imperiously bade him write\r\na receipt.\r\n\r\nThe man did so, but with so unmistakable an air of cunning and triumph\r\nthat Eric was both astonished and dismayed.  Could the miscreant have\r\nany further plot against him?  At first he fancied that Billy might\r\nattempt to extort money by a threat of telling Dr Rowlands; but this\r\nsupposition he banished as unlikely, since it might expose Billy himself\r\nto very unpleasant consequences.\r\n\r\nEric snatched the receipt, and said contemptuously, "Never come near me\r\nagain; next time you come up to the studies I\'ll tell Carter to turn you\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho, ho!" sneered Billy.  "How mighty we young gents are all of a\r\nsudden.  Unless you buy of me sometimes, you shall hear of me again;\r\nnever fear, young gen\'leman."  He shouted out the latter words, for Eric\r\nhad turned scornfully on his heel, and was already in the street.\r\n\r\nObviously more danger was to be apprehended from this quarter.  At first\r\nthe thought of it was disquieting, but three weeks glided away, and\r\nEric, now absorbed heart and soul in school work, began to remember it\r\nas a mere vague and idle threat.\r\n\r\nBut one afternoon, to his horror, he again heard Billy\'s step on the\r\nstairs, and again saw the hateful iniquitous face at the door.\r\n\r\n"Not much custom from you lately, sir," said Billy mockingly.  "Anything\r\nin my line to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t I tell you never to come near me again, you foul villain?" cried\r\nEric, springing up in a flame of wrath.  "Go this instant, or I\'ll call\r\nCarter," and opening the window, he prepared to put his threat into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho, ho!  Better look at summat I\'ve got first."  It was a printed\r\nnotice to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n  "Five Pounds Reward."\r\n\r\n  "Whereas some evil-disposed persons stole some pigeons on the evening\r\n  of April 6th from the Reverend H Gordon\'s premises; the above reward\r\n  will be given for any such information as may lead to the apprehension\r\n  of the offenders."\r\n\r\nSoon after the seizure of the pigeons there had been a rumour that\r\nGordon had offered a reward of this kind, but the matter had been\r\nforgotten, and the boys had long fancied their secret secure, though at\r\nfirst they had been terribly alarmed.\r\n\r\n"What do you show me that for?" he asked, reddening and then growing\r\npale again.\r\n\r\nBilly\'s only answer was to pass his finger slowly along the words, "Five\r\npounds reward."\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I thinks I knows who took they pigeons."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to me?"\r\n\r\n"Ho, ho, ho! that\'s a good \'un," was Billy\'s reply; and he continued to\r\ncackle as though enjoying a great joke.\r\n\r\n"Unless you gives me five pound, anyhow, I knows where to get \'em.  I\r\nknow who them evil-disposed persons be!  So I\'ll give ye another week to\r\ndecide."\r\n\r\nBilly shambled off in high spirits; but Eric sank back into his chair.\r\nFive pounds!  The idea haunted him.  How could he ever get them?  To\r\nwrite home again was out of the question.  The Trevors, though liberal,\r\nwere not rich, and after just sending him so large a sum, it was\r\nimpossible, he thought, that they should send him five pounds more at\r\nhis mere request.  Besides, how could he be sure that Billy would not\r\nplay upon his fears to extort further sums?  And to explain the matter\r\nto them fully was more than he could endure.  He remembered now how\r\neasily his want of caution might have put Billy in possession of the\r\nsecret, and he knew enough of the fellow\'s character to feel quite sure\r\nof the use he would be inclined to make of it.  Oh, how he cursed that\r\nhour of folly!\r\n\r\nFive pounds!  He began to think of what money he could procure.  He\r\nthought again and again, but it was no use; only one thing was clear--he\r\n_had_ not the money and could not get it.  Miserable boy!  It was too\r\nlate then? for him repentance was to be made impossible; every time he\r\nattempted it he was to be thwarted by some fresh discovery.  And,\r\nleaning his head on his open palms, poor Eric sobbed like a child.\r\n\r\nFive pounds!  And all this misery was to come upon him for the want of\r\nfive pounds!  Expulsion was _certain_, was _inevitable_ now, and perhaps\r\nfor Wildney too as well as for himself.  After all his fine promises in\r\nhis letters home,--yes, that reminded him of Vernon.  The grave had not\r\nclosed for a month over one brother, and the other would be _expelled_.\r\nOh, misery, misery!  He was sure it would break his mother\'s heart.  Oh,\r\nhow cruel everything was to him!\r\n\r\nFive pounds!  He wondered whether Montagu would lend it him, or any\r\nother boy?  But then it was late in the quarter, and all the boys would\r\nhave spent the money they brought with them from home.  There was no\r\nchance of any one having five pounds, and to a master he _dare_ not\r\napply, not even to Mr Rose.  The offence was too serious to be\r\noverlooked, and if noticed at all, he fancied that, after his other\r\ndelinquencies, it _must_, as a matter of notoriety, be visited with\r\nexpulsion.  He could not face that bitter thought; he could not thus\r\nbring open disgrace upon his father\'s and his brother\'s name; this was\r\nthe fear which kept recurring to him with dreadful iteration.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered that if he had continued captain of the school\r\neleven, he would have had easy command of the money, by being treasurer\r\nof the cricket subscriptions.  But at Vernon\'s death he lost all\r\ninterest in cricket for a time, and had thrown up his office, to which\r\nMontagu had been elected by the general suffrage.\r\n\r\nHe wondered whether there was as much as five pounds of the cricketing\r\nmoney left!  He knew that the box which contained it was in Montagu\'s\r\nstudy, and he also knew where the key was kept.  It was merely a feeling\r\nof curiosity--he would go and look.\r\n\r\nAll this passed through Eric\'s mind as he sat in his study after Billy\r\nhad gone.  It was a sultry summer day; all the study doors were open,\r\nand all their occupants were absent in the cricket-field, or bathing.\r\nHe stole into Montagu\'s study, hastily got the key, and took down the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n"Oh, put it down, put it down, Eric," said Conscience; "what business\r\nhave you with it?"\r\n\r\n"Pooh! it is merely curiosity; as if I couldn\'t trust myself!"\r\n\r\n"Put it down," repeated Conscience authoritatively, deigning no longer\r\nto argue or entreat.\r\n\r\nEric hesitated, and did put down the box; but he did not instantly leave\r\nthe room.  He began to look at Montagu\'s books and then out of the\r\nwindow.  The gravel playground was deserted, he noticed, for the\r\ncricket-field.  Nobody was near therefore.  Well, what of that? he was\r\ndoing no harm.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!  I _will_ just look and see if there\'s five pounds in the\r\ncricket-box."  Slowly at first he put out his hand, and then, hastily\r\nturning the key, opened the box.  It contained three pounds in gold, and\r\na quantity of silver.  He began to count the silver, putting it on the\r\ntable, and found that it made up three pounds ten more.  "So that,\r\naltogether, there\'s six pounds ten; that\'s thirty shillings more than--\r\nand it won\'t be wanted till next summer term, because all the bats and\r\nballs are bought now.  I dare say Montagu won\'t even open the box again.\r\nI know he keeps it stowed away in a corner, and hardly ever looks at\r\nit, and I can put back the five pounds the very first day of next term,\r\nand it will save me from expulsion."\r\n\r\nVery slowly Eric took the three sovereigns and put them in his pocket,\r\nand then he took up one of the heaps of shillings and sixpences which he\r\nhad counted, and dropped them also into his trousers; they fell into the\r\npocket with a great jingle, "Eric, you are a thief!"  He thought he\r\nheard his brother Vernon\'s voice utter the words thrillingly distinct,\r\nbut it was conscience who had borrowed the Voice, and, sick with horror,\r\nhe began to shake the money out of his pockets again into the box.  He\r\nwas only just in time; he had barely locked the box, and put it in its\r\nplace, when he heard the sound of voices and footsteps on the stairs.\r\nHe had no time to take out the key and put it back where he found it,\r\nand hardly time-to slip into his own study again, when the boys had\r\nreached the landing.\r\n\r\nThey were Duncan and Montagu, and as they passed the door, Eric\r\npretended to be plunged in books.\r\n\r\n"Hallo, Eric! grinding as usual," said Duncan good-humouredly; but he\r\nonly got a sickly smile in reply.\r\n\r\n"What! are you the only fellow in the studies?" asked Montagu.  "I was\r\nnearly sure I heard some one moving about as we came upstairs."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think there\'s any one here but me," said Eric, "and I\'m going a\r\nwalk now."\r\n\r\nHe closed his books with a bang, flew down stairs, and away through the\r\nplayground towards the shore, vaulting with one hand the playground\r\ngate.  But he could not so escape his thoughts.  "Eric, you are a thief!\r\nEric, you are a thief!" rang in his ear.  "Yes," he thought; "I am even\r\na thief.  Oh, good God, yes, _even a thief_ for I _had_ actually stolen\r\nthe money, until I changed my mind.  What if they should have heard the\r\njingle of money, or should discover the key in the box, knowing, that I\r\nwas the only fellow up stairs?  Oh, mercy, mercy, mercy!"\r\n\r\nIt was a lonely place, and he flung himself down and hid his face in the\r\ncoarse grass, trying to cool the wild burning of his brow.  And as he\r\nlay he thrust his hand into the guilty pocket!  Good heavens! there was\r\nsomething still there.  He pulled it out; it was a sovereign.  Then he\r\nwas a thief, even actually.  Oh, everything was against him; and\r\nstarting to his feet, he flung the accursed gold over the rocks far into\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nWhen he got home, he felt so inconceivably wretched, that, unable to\r\nwork, he begged leave to go to bed at once.  It was long before he fell\r\nasleep; but when he did, the sleep was more terrible than the haunted\r\nwakefulness.  For he had no rest from tormenting and horrid dreams.\r\nBrigson and Billy, their bodies grown to gigantic proportions, and their\r\nfaces fierce with demoniacal wickedness, seemed to be standing over him,\r\nand demanding five pounds on pain of death.  Flights of pigeons,\r\ndarkening the air, settled on him, and flapped about him.  He fled from\r\nthem madly through the dark midnight, but many steps pursued him.  He\r\nsaw Mr Rose, and running up, seized him by the hand, and implored\r\nprotection.  But in his dream Mr Rose turned from him with a cold look\r\nof sorrowful reproach.  And then he saw Wildney, and cried out to him,\r\n"O Charlie, do speak to me!" but Charlie ran away, saying, "_You_, Eric!\r\nwhat? _you_ a thief!" and then a chorus of voices took up that awful\r\ncry--voices of expostulation, voices of contempt, voices of indignation,\r\nvoices of menace; they took up the cry, and repeated and re-echoed it;\r\nbut most unendurable of all, there were voices of wailing and voices of\r\ngentleness among them, and his soul died within him as he caught, amid\r\nthe confusion of condemning sounds, the voices of Russell and Vernon,\r\nand they, too, were saying to him, in tender pity and agonised\r\nastonishment, "Eric, Eric, you are a thief!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nREAPING THE WHIRLWIND.\r\n\r\n  For alas! alas! with me\r\n  The light of life is o\'er;\r\n  No more--no more--no more!\r\n  (Such language holds the solemn sea\r\n  To the sands upon the shore)\r\n  Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,\r\n  Or the stricken eagle soar!\r\n  _Edgar Poe_.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of "The Jolly Herring" had observed, during his visits to\r\nEric, that at mid-day the studies were usually deserted, and the doors\r\nfor the most part left unlocked.  He very soon determined to make use of\r\nthis knowledge for his own purposes, and, as he was well acquainted with\r\nthe building (in which for a short time he had been a servant), he laid\r\nhis plans without the least dread of discovery.\r\n\r\nThere was a back entrance into Roslyn School behind the chapel, and it\r\ncould be reached by a path through the fields without any chance of\r\nbeing seen, if a person set warily to work and watched his opportunity.\r\nBy this path Billy came, two days after his last visit, and walked\r\nstraight up the great staircase, armed with the excuse of business with\r\nEric in case any one met or questioned him.  But no one was about, since\r\nbetween twelve and one the boys were pretty sure to be amusing\r\nthemselves out of doors; and after glancing into each of the studies,\r\nBilly finally settled on searching Montagu\'s (which was the neatest and\r\nmost tastefully furnished), to see what he could get.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing which caught his experienced eye was the\r\ncricket-fund box, with the key temptingly in the lock, just where Eric\r\nhad left it when the sounds of some one coming had startled him.  In a\r\nmoment Billy had made a descent on the promising looking booty, and\r\nopening his treasure, saw, with lively feelings of gratification, the\r\nunexpected store of silver and gold.  This he instantly transferred to\r\nhis own pocket, and then, replacing the box where he had found it,\r\ndecamped with the spoil unseen, leaving the study in all other respects\r\nexactly as he had found it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the unhappy Eric was tossed and agitated with apprehension and\r\nsuspense.  Unable to endure his misery in loneliness, he had made\r\nseveral boys to a greater or less degree participators in the knowledge\r\nof his difficult position; and in the sympathy which his danger excited,\r\nthe general nature of his dilemma with Billy (though not its special\r\ncircumstances) was soon known through the school.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when the money was being stolen, Eric was sitting with\r\nWildney and Graham under the ruin by the shore, and the sorrow which lay\r\nat his heart was sadly visible in the anxious expression of his face,\r\nand the deep dejection of his attitude and manner.\r\n\r\nThe other two were trying to console him.  They suggested every possible\r\ntopic of hope; but it was too plain that there was nothing to be said,\r\nand that Eric had real cause to fear the worst.  Yet though their\r\narguments were futile, he keenly felt the genuineness of their\r\naffection, and it brought a little alleviation to his heavy mood.\r\n\r\n"Well, well; at least _do_ hope the best, Eric," said Graham.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" urged Wildney; "only think, dear old fellow, what lots of worse\r\nscrapes we\'ve been in before, and how we\'ve always managed to get out of\r\nthem somehow."\r\n\r\n"No, my boy; not worse scrapes," answered Eric.  "Depend upon it this is\r\nthe last for me; I shall not have the chance of getting into another at\r\n_Roslyn_, anyhow."\r\n\r\n"Poor Eric! what shall I do if you leave?" said Wildney, laying his arm\r\non Eric\'s shoulder.  "Besides it\'s all my fault, hang it, that you got\r\ninto this cursed row."\r\n\r\n  "The curse is come upon me, cried\r\n  The Lady of Shalott.\r\n\r\n"Those words keep ringing in my ears," murmured Eric.\r\n\r\n"Well, Eric, if _you_ are sent away, I know I shall get my father to\r\ntake me too, and then we\'ll join each other somewhere.  Come, cheer up,\r\nold boy--being sent isn\'t such a very frightful thing after all."\r\n\r\n"No," said Graham; "and besides the bagging of the pigeons was only a\r\nlark, when one comes to think of it.  It wasn\'t like stealing, you know;\r\n_that\'d_ be quite a different thing."\r\n\r\nEric winced visibly at this remark, but his companions did not notice\r\nit.  "Ah," thought he, "there\'s _one_ passage of my life which I never\r\nshall be able to reveal to any human soul."\r\n\r\n"Come now, Eric," said Wildney, "I\'ve got something to propose.  You\r\nshall play cricket to-day; you haven\'t played for an age, and it\'s high\r\ntime you should.  If you don\'t, you\'ll go mooning about the shore all\r\nday, and that\'ll never do, for you\'ll come back glummer than ever."\r\n\r\n"No," said Eric, with a heavy sigh, as the image of Vernon instantly\r\npassed through his mind; "no more cricket for me."\r\n\r\n"Nay, but you _must_ play to-day.  Come, you shan\'t say no.  You won\'t\r\nsay no to me, will you, dear old fellow?"  And looked up to him with\r\nthat pleasant smile, and the merry light in his dark eyes, which had\r\nalways been so charming to Eric\'s fancy.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no refusing you," said Eric, with the ghost of a laugh, as he\r\nboxed Wildney\'s ears.  "Oh, you dear little rogue, Charlie, I wish I\r\nwere you."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! pooh! now you shan\'t get sentimental again.  As if you weren\'t\r\nfifty times better than me every way.  I\'m sure I don\'t know how I shall\r\never thank you enough, Eric," he added more seriously, "for all your\r\nkindness to me."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so glad you\'re going to play, though," said Graham; "and so will\r\neverybody be, and I\'m certain it\'ll be good for you.  The game will\r\ndivert your thoughts."\r\n\r\nSo that afternoon Eric, for the first time since Verny\'s death, played\r\nwith the first eleven, of which he had been captain.  The school cheered\r\nhim vigorously as he appeared again on the field, and the sound lighted\r\nup his countenance with some gleam of its old joyousness.  When one\r\nlooked at him that day with his straw hat on and its neat light blue\r\nribbon, and the cricket dress (a pink jersey, and leather belt, with a\r\nsilver clasp in front), showing off his well-built and graceful figure,\r\none little thought what an agony was gnawing like a serpent at his\r\nheart.  But that day, poor boy, in the excitement of the game he half\r\nforgot it himself, and more and more as the game went on.\r\n\r\nThe other side, headed by Montagu, went in first, and Eric caught out\r\ntwo and bowled several.  Montagu was the only one who stayed in long,\r\nand when at last Eric sent his middle wicket flying with a magnificent\r\nball, the shouts of, "Well bowled! well bowled _indeed_!" were\r\nuniversal.\r\n\r\n"Just listen to that, Eric," said Montagu; "why, you\'re out-doing\r\neverybody to-day, yourself included, and taking us by storm."\r\n\r\n"Wait till you see me come out for a duck," said Eric, laughing.\r\n\r\n"Not you.  You\'re too much in luck to come out with a duck," answered\r\nMontagu.  "You see I\'ve already become the poet of your triumphs, and\r\nprophesy in rhyme."\r\n\r\nAnd now it was Eric\'s turn to go in.  It was long since he had stood\r\nbefore the wicket, but now he was there, looking like a beautiful\r\npicture as the sunlight streamed over him, and made his fair hair shine\r\nlike gold.  In the triumph of success his sorrows were flung to the\r\nwinds, and his blue eyes sparkled with interest and joy.\r\n\r\nHe contented himself with blocking Duncan\'s balls until his eye was in;\r\nbut then, acquiring confidence, he sent them flying right and left.  His\r\nscore rapidly mounted, and there seemed no chance of getting him out, so\r\nthat there was every probability of his carrying out his bat.\r\n\r\n"Oh, _well_ hit! _well_ hit!  A three-er for Eric," cried Wildney to the\r\nscorer; and he began to clap his hands and dance about with excitement\r\nat his friend\'s success.\r\n\r\n"Oh, well hit! well hit in-deed!" shouted all the lookers on, as Eric\r\ncaught the next ball half-volley, and sent it whizzing over the hedge,\r\ngetting a sixer by the hit.\r\n\r\nAt the next ball they heard a great crack, and he got no run, for the\r\nhandle of his bat broke right off.\r\n\r\n"How unlucky!" he said, flinging down the handle with vexation.  "I\r\nbelieve this was our best bat."\r\n\r\n"Oh, never mind," said Montagu; "we can soon get another; we\'ve got lots\r\nof money in the box."\r\n\r\nWhat had come over Eric? if there had been a sudden breath of poison in\r\nthe atmosphere he could hardly have been more affected than he was by\r\nMontagu\'s simple remark.  Montagu could not help noticing it, but at the\r\ntime merely attributed it to some unknown gust of feeling, and made no\r\ncomment.  But Eric, hastily borrowing another bat, took his place again\r\nquite tamely; he was trembling, and at the very next ball, he spooned a\r\nmiserable catch into Graham\'s hand, and the shout of triumph from the\r\nother side proclaimed that his innings was over.\r\n\r\nHe walked dejectedly to the pavilion for his coat, and the boys, who\r\nwere seated in crowds about it, received him, of course, after his\r\nbrilliant score, with loud and continued plaudits.  But the light had\r\ndied away from his face and figure, and he never raised his eyes from\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n"Eric!" said Wildney chaffingly, "you don\'t acknowledge your honours."\r\n\r\nEric dropped his bat in the corner, put his coat across his arm, and\r\nwalked away.  As he passed Wildney, he stooped down and whispered again\r\nin a low voice--\r\n\r\n  "The curse has come upon me, cried\r\n  The Lady of Shalott."\r\n\r\n"Hush, Eric, nonsense,", whispered Wildney; "you\'re not going away," he\r\ncontinued aloud, as Eric turned towards the school.  "Why, there are\r\nonly two more to go in!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, thank you, I must go."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then, I\'ll come too."\r\n\r\nWildney at once joined his friend.  "There\'s nothing more the matter, is\r\nthere?" he asked anxiously, when they were out of hearing of the rest.\r\n\r\n"God only knows."\r\n\r\n"Well, let\'s change the subject.  You\'ve been playing brilliantly, old\r\nfellow."\r\n\r\n"Have I?"\r\n\r\n"I should just think so, only you got out in rather a stupid way."\r\n\r\n"Ah well! it matters very little."\r\n\r\nJust at this moment one of the servants handed Eric a kind note from\r\nMrs Rowlands, with whom he was a very great favourite, asking him to\r\ntea that night.  He was not much surprised, for he had been asked\r\nseveral times lately, and the sweet womanly kindness which she always\r\nshowed him caused him the greatest pleasure.  Besides, she had known his\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"Upon my word, honours _are_ being showered on you!" said Wildney.\r\n"First to get _the_ score of the season at cricket, and bowl out about\r\nhalf the other side, and then go to tea with the head-master.  Upon my\r\nword!  Why, any of us poor wretches would give our two ears for such\r\ndistinctions.  Talk of curse indeed!  Fiddlestick-end!"\r\n\r\nBut Eric\'s sorrow lay too deep for chaff, and, only answering with a\r\nsigh, he went to dress for tea.\r\n\r\nJust before tea-time Duncan and Montagu strolled in together.  "How\r\nsplendidly Eric played," said Duncan.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed.  I\'m so glad.  By the bye, I must see about getting a new\r\nbat.  I don\'t know exactly how much money we\'ve got, but I know there\'s\r\nplenty.  Let\'s come and see."\r\n\r\nThey entered his study, and he looked about everywhere for the key.\r\n\r\n"Hallo," he said, "I\'m nearly sure I left it in the corner of this\r\ndrawer, under some other things; but it isn\'t there now.  What can have\r\nbecome of it?"\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the box?" said Duncan; "let\'s see if any of my keys will fit\r\nit.  Hallo! why _you\'re_ a nice treasurer, Monty! here\'s the key in the\r\nbox!"\r\n\r\n"No, is it though?" asked Montagu, looking serious.  "Here, give it me;\r\nI hope nobody\'s been meddling with it."\r\n\r\nHe opened it quickly, and stood in dumb and blank amazement to see it\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n"Phee-ew!"  Montagu gave a long whistle.\r\n\r\n"By Jove!" was Duncan\'s only comment.\r\n\r\nThe boys looked at each other, but neither dared to express what was in\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\n"A bad, bad business! what\'s to be done, Monty?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll rush straight down to tea, and ask the fellows about it.  Would\r\nyou mind requesting Rose not to come in for five minutes?  Tell him\r\nthere\'s a row."\r\n\r\nHe ran down stairs hastily and entered the tea-room, where the boys were\r\ntalking in high spirits about the match, and liberally praising Eric\'s\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got something unpleasant to say," he announced, raising his voice.\r\n\r\n"Hush! hush! hush! what\'s the row?" asked half a dozen at once.\r\n\r\n"The whole of the cricket-money, some six pounds at least, has vanished\r\nfrom the box in my study!"\r\n\r\nFor an instant the whole room was silent; Wildney and Graham\r\ninterchanged anxious glances.\r\n\r\n"Does any fellow know anything about this?"\r\n\r\nAll, or most, had a vague suspicion, but no one spoke.\r\n\r\n"Where is Williams?" asked one of the sixth-form casually.\r\n\r\n"He\'s taking tea with the Doctor," said Wildney.\r\n\r\nMr Rose came in, and there was no opportunity for more to be said,\r\nexcept in confidential whispers.\r\n\r\nDuncan went up with Owen and Montagu to their study.  "What\'s to be\r\ndone?" was the general question.\r\n\r\n"I think we\'ve all had a lesson once before not to suspect, too hastily.\r\nStill, in a matter like this," said Montagu, "one _must_ take notice of\r\napparent cues."  "I know what you\'re thinking of, Monty," said Duncan.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, did you hear anything when you and I surprised Eric\r\nsuddenly two days ago?"\r\n\r\n"I heard some one moving about in your study, as I thought."\r\n\r\n"I heard more, though at the time it didn\'t strike me particularly.  I\r\ndistinctly heard the jingle of money."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s no good counting up suspicious circumstances; we must _ask_\r\nhim about it and act accordingly."\r\n\r\n"Will he come up to the studies again to-night?"\r\n\r\n"I think not," said Owen; "I notice he generally goes straight to bed\r\nafter he has been out to tea; that\'s to say, directly after prayers."\r\n\r\nThe three sat there till prayer-time, taciturn and thoughtful.  Their\r\nbooks were open, but they did little work, and it was evident that\r\nMontagu was filled with the most touching grief.  During the evening he\r\ndrew out a little likeness which Eric had given him, and looked at it\r\nlong and earnestly.  "Is it possible?" he thought.  "O Eric, Eric! can\r\nthat face be the face of a thief?"\r\n\r\nThe prayer-bell dispelled his reverie.  Eric entered with the\r\nRowlandses, and sat in his accustomed place.  He had spent a pleasant,\r\nquiet evening, and, little knowing what had happened, felt far more\r\ncheerful and hopeful than he had done before, although he was still\r\nignorant how to escape the difficulty which threatened him.\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t help observing that as he entered he was the object of\r\ngeneral attention; but he attributed it either to his playing that day,\r\nor to the circumstances in which he was placed by Billy\'s treachery, of\r\nwhich he knew that many boys were now aware.  But when prayers were\r\nover, and he saw that every one shunned him, or looked and spoke in the\r\ncoldest manner, his most terrible fears revived.\r\n\r\nHe went off to his dormitory, and began to undress.  As he sat half\r\nabstracted on his bed doing nothing, Montagu and Duncan entered, and he\r\nstarted to see them, for they were evidently the bearers of some serious\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n"Eric," said Duncan, "do you know that some one has stolen all the\r\ncricket-money?"\r\n\r\n"Stolen--what--_all_?" he cried, leaping up as if he had been shot.\r\n"Oh, what new retribution is this?" and he hid his face, which had\r\nturned ashy pale, in his hands.\r\n\r\n"To cut matters short, Eric, do you know anything about it?"\r\n\r\n"If it is all gone, it is not I who stole it," he said, not lifting his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"Do you know anything about it?"\r\n\r\n"No!" he sobbed convulsively.  "No, no, no!  Yet stop; don\'t let me add\r\na lie--Let me think.  No, Duncan!" he said, looking up, "I do _not_ know\r\nwho stole it."\r\n\r\nThey stood silent, and the tears were stealing down Montagu\'s averted\r\nface.\r\n\r\n"O Duncan, Monty, be merciful, be merciful," said Eric.  "Don\'t yet\r\ncondemn me.  I am guilty, not of _this_, but of something as bad.  I\r\nadmit I was tempted; but if the money really is all gone, it is _not_ I\r\nwho am the thief."\r\n\r\n"You must know, Eric, that the suspicion against you is very strong, and\r\nrests on some definite facts."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know it must.  Yet, oh, do be merciful, and don\'t yet condemn\r\nme.  I have denied it.  Whatever else I am, am I a liar, Monty?  O\r\nMonty, Monty, believe me in this!"\r\n\r\nBut the boys still stood silent.\r\n\r\n"Well then," he said, "I will tell you all.  But I can only tell it to\r\nyou, Monty.  Duncan, indeed, you mustn\'t be angry; you are my friend,\r\nbut not so much as Monty.  I can tell him, and him only."\r\n\r\nDuncan left the room, and Montagu sat down beside Eric on the bed, and\r\nput his arm round him to support him, for he shook violently.  There,\r\nwith deep and wild emotion, and many interruptions of passionate\r\nsilence, Eric told to Montagu his miserable tale.  "I am the most\r\nwretched fellow living," he said; "there must be some fiend that hates\r\nme, and drives me to ruin.  But let it all come: I care nothing,\r\nnothing, what happens to me now.  Only, dear, dear Monty, forgive me,\r\nand love me still."\r\n\r\n"O Eric, it is not for one like me to talk of forgiveness; you were\r\nsorely tempted.  Yet God will forgive you if you ask Him.  Won\'t you\r\npray to Him to-night?  I love you, Eric, still, with all my heart, and\r\ndo you think God can be less kind than man?  And _I_, too, will pray for\r\nyou, Eric.  Good-night, and God bless you."  He gently disengaged\r\nhimself--for Eric clung to him, and seemed unwilling to lose sight of\r\nhim--and a moment after he was gone.\r\n\r\nEric felt terribly alone.  He knelt down and tried to pray, but somehow\r\nit didn\'t seem as if the prayer came from his heart, and his thoughts\r\nbegan instantly to wander far away.  Still he knelt--knelt even until\r\nhis candle had gone out, and he had nearly fallen asleep,\r\nthought-wearied, on his knees.  And then he got into bed still dressed.\r\nHe had been making up his mind that he could bear it no longer, and\r\nwould run away to sea that night.\r\n\r\nHe waited till eleven, when Dr Rowlands took his rounds.  The Doctor\r\nhad been told all the circumstances of suspicion, and they amounted in\r\nhis mind to certainty.  It made him very sad, and he stopped to look at\r\nthe boy from whom he had parted on such friendly terms so short a time\r\nbefore.  Eric did not pretend to be asleep, but opened his eyes, and\r\nlooked at the head-master.  Very sorrowfully Dr Rowlands shook his\r\nhead, and went away.  Eric never saw him again.\r\n\r\nThe moment he was gone Eric got up.  He meant to go to his study,\r\ncollect the few presents, which were his dearest mementos of Russell,\r\nWildney, and his other friends--above all, Vernon\'s likeness--and then\r\nmake his escape from the building, using for the last time the broken\r\npane and loosened bar in the corridor, with which past temptations had\r\nmade him so familiar.\r\n\r\nHe turned the handle of the door and pushed, but it did not yield.  Half\r\ncontemplating the possibility of such an intention on Eric\'s part, Dr\r\nRowlands had locked it behind him when he went out.\r\n\r\n"Ha!" thought the boy, "then he too knows and suspects.  Never mind.  I\r\nmust give up my treasures--yes, even poor Verny\'s picture; perhaps it is\r\nbest I should, for I\'m only disgracing his dear memory.  But they shan\'t\r\nprevent me from running away."\r\n\r\nOnce more he deliberated.  Yes, there could be no doubt about the\r\ndecision.  He _could_ not endure another public expulsion, or even\r\nanother birching; he _could_ not endure the cold faces of even his best\r\nfriends.  No, no! he _could_ not face the horrible phantom of detection,\r\nand exposure, and shame.  But worse than all this, he could not endure\r\n_himself_; he must fly away from the sense that _he_, Eric Williams, the\r\nbrother of Vernon, the friend of Edwin Russell, was sunk in all\r\ndegradation.  Could it really, really be, that _he_, once the soul of\r\nchivalrous honour, who once would have felt a stain like a wound,--was\r\nit possible that he should have been a thief?  It was too dreadful a\r\nthought.  Escape he must.\r\n\r\nAfter using all his strength in long-continued efforts, he succeeded in\r\nloosening the bar of his bedroom window.  He then took his two sheets,\r\ntied them together in a firm knot, wound one end tightly round the\r\nremaining bar, and let the other fall down the side of the building.  He\r\ntook one more glance round his little room, and then let himself down by\r\nthe sheet, hand under hand, until he could drop to the ground.  Once\r\nsafe, he ran towards Starhaven as fast as he could, and felt as if he\r\nwere flying for his life.  But when he got to the end of the playground\r\nhe could not help stopping to take one more longing, lingering look at\r\nthe scenes he was leaving for ever.  It was a chilly and overclouded\r\nnight, and by the gleams of struggling moonlight, he saw the whole\r\nbuildings standing out black in the night air.  The past lay behind him\r\nlike a painting.  Many and many unhappy or guilty hours had he spent in\r\nthat home, and yet those last four years had not gone by without their\r\nown wealth of life and joy.  He remembered how he had first walked\r\nacross that playground, hand in hand with his father, a little boy of\r\ntwelve.  He remembered his first troubles with Barker, and how his\r\nfather had at last delivered him from the annoyances of his old enemy.\r\nHe remembered how often he and Russell had sat there, looking at the\r\nsea, in pleasant talk, especially the evening when he had got his first\r\nprize and head-remove in the lower-fourth; and how, on the night of\r\nRussell\'s death, he had gazed over that playground from the sick-room\r\nwindow.  He remembered how often he had got cheered there for his feats\r\nat cricket and football, and how often he and Upton, in old days, and he\r\nand Wildney afterwards, had walked there on Sundays, arm in arm.  Then\r\nthe stroll to Fort Island, and Barker\'s plot against him, and the\r\nevening at the Stack, passed through his mind; and the dinner at "The\r\nJolly Herring," and, above all, Vernon\'s death.  Oh! how awful it seemed\r\nto him now, as he looked through the darkness at the very road along\r\nwhich they had brought Verny\'s dead body.  Then his thoughts turned to\r\nthe theft of the pigeons, his own drunkenness, and then his last cruel,\r\ncruel experiences, and this dreadful end of the day which, for an hour\r\nor two, had seemed so bright on that very spot where he stood.  Could it\r\nbe that this (oh, how little he had ever dreamed of it)--that this was\r\nto be the conclusion of his schooldays?\r\n\r\nYes, in those rooms, of which the windows fronted him, there they lay,\r\nall his school-fellows--Montagu, and Wildney, and Duncan, and all whom\r\nhe cared for best.  And there was Mr Rose\'s light still burning in the\r\nlibrary window; and he was leaving the school and those who had been\r\nwith him there so long, in the dark night, by stealth, penniless, and\r\nbroken-hearted, with the shameful character of a thief.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr Rose\'s light moved, and fearing discovery or interception,\r\nhe roused himself from the bitter reverie and fled to Starhaven through\r\nthe darkness.  There was still a light in the little sailors\' tavern,\r\nand, entering, he asked the woman who kept it, "if she knew of any ship\r\nwhich was going to sail next morning?"\r\n\r\n"Why, your\'n is, bean\'t it, Maister Davey?" she asked, turning to a\r\nrough-looking sailor who sat smoking in the bar.\r\n\r\n"Ees," grunted the man.\r\n\r\n"Will you take me on board?" said Eric.\r\n\r\n"You be a runaway, I\'m thinking?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind.  I\'ll come as cabin-boy--anything."\r\n\r\nThe sailor glanced at his striking appearance and neat dress.  "Hardly\r\nin the cabin-boy line, I should say."\r\n\r\n"Will you take me?" said Eric.  "You\'ll find me strong and willing\r\nenough."\r\n\r\n"Well--if the skipper don\'t say no.  Come along."\r\n\r\nThey went down to a boat, and "Maister Davey" rowed to a schooner in the\r\nharbour, and took Eric on board.\r\n\r\n"There," he said, "you may sleep there for to-night," and he pointed to\r\na great heap of sailcloth beside the mast.\r\n\r\nWeary to death, Eric flung himself down, and slept deep and sound till\r\nthe morning, on board the _Stormy Petrel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nTHE "STORMY PETREL."\r\n\r\n  They hadna sailed a league, a league,\r\n  A league but barely three,\r\n  When the lift grew dark, and the wind grew high,\r\n  And gurly grew the sea.\r\n  _Sir Patrick Spens_.\r\n\r\n"Hilloa!" exclaimed the skipper with a sudden start, next morning, as he\r\nsaw Eric\'s recumbent figure on the ratlin stuff, "who be this young\r\nvarmint?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I brought him aboord last night," said Davey; "he wanted to be\r\ncabin-boy."\r\n\r\n"Precious like un _he_ looks.  Never mind, we\'ve got him and we\'ll use\r\nhim."\r\n\r\nThe vessel was under way when Eric woke and collected his scattered\r\nthoughts to a remembrance of his new position.  At first, as the _Stormy\r\nPetrel_ dashed its way gallantly through the blue sea, he felt one\r\nabsorbing sense of joy to have escaped from Roslyn.  But before he had\r\nbeen three hours on board, his eyes were opened to the trying nature of\r\nhis circumstances, which were, indeed, _so_ trying that _anything_ in\r\nthe world seemed preferable to enduring them.  He had escaped from\r\nRoslyn, but, alas he had not escaped from himself.  He had hardly been\r\nthree hours on board when he would have given everything in his power to\r\nbe back again; but such regrets were useless, for the vessel was now\r\nfairly on her way for Corunna, where she was to take in a cargo of\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nThere were eight men belonging to the crew; and as the ship was only a\r\nlittle trading schooner, these were sailors of the lowest and coarsest\r\ngrade.  They all seemed to take their cue from the captain, who was a\r\ndrunken, blaspheming, and cruel vagabond.\r\n\r\nThis man from the first took a savage hatred to Eric, partly because he\r\nwas annoyed with Davey for bringing him on board.  The first words he\r\naddressed to him were--\r\n\r\n"I say, you young lubber, you must pay your footing."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got nothing to pay with.  I brought no money with me."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, you shall give us your gran\' clothes.  Them things isn\'t\r\nfit for a cabin-boy."\r\n\r\nEric saw no remedy, and making a virtue of necessity, exchanged his good\r\ncloth suit for a rough sailor\'s shirt and trousers, not over clean,\r\nwhich the captain gave him.  His own clothes were at once appropriated\r\nby that functionary, who carried them into his cabin.  But it was lucky\r\nfor Eric that, seeing how matters were likely to go, he had succeeded in\r\nsecreting his watch.\r\n\r\nThe day grew misty and comfortless, and towards evening the wind rose to\r\na storm.  Eric soon began to feel very sick, and, to make his case\r\nworse, could not endure either the taste, smell, or sight of such coarse\r\nfood as was contemptuously flung to him.\r\n\r\n"Where am I to sleep?" he asked, "I feel very sick."\r\n\r\n"Babby," said one of the sailors, "what\'s your name?"\r\n\r\n"Williams."\r\n\r\n"Well, Bill, you\'ll have to get over yer sickness pretty soon, _I_ can\r\ntell ye.  Here," he added, relenting a little, "Davey\'s slung ye a\r\nhammock in the forecastle."\r\n\r\nHe showed the way, but poor Eric in the dark, and amid the lurches of\r\nthe vessel, could hardly steady himself down the companion-ladder, much\r\nless get into his hammock.  The man saw his condition, and, sulkily\r\nenough, hove him into his place.\r\n\r\nAnd there, in that swinging bed, where sleep seemed impossible, and in\r\nwhich he was unpleasantly shaken about, when the ship rolled and pitched\r\nthrough the dark, heaving, discoloured waves, and with dirty men\r\nsleeping round him at night, until the atmosphere of the forecastle\r\nbecame like poison, hopelessly and helplessly sick, and half-starved,\r\nthe boy lay for two days.  The crew neglected him shamefully.  It was\r\nnobody\'s business to wait on him, and he could procure neither\r\nsufficient food nor any water; they only brought him some grog to drink,\r\nwhich in his weakness and sickness was nauseous to him as medicine.\r\n\r\n"I say, you young cub down there," shouted the skipper to him from the\r\nhatchway, "come up and swab this deck."\r\n\r\nHe got up, and after bruising himself severely, as he stumbled about to\r\nfind the ladder, made an effort to obey the command.  But he staggered\r\nfrom feebleness when he reached the deck, and had to grasp for some\r\nfresh support at every step.\r\n\r\n"None of that \'ere slobbering and shamming, Bill.  Why, damn you, what\r\nd\'ye think you\'re here for, eh?  You swab this deck, and in five\r\nminutes, or I\'ll teach you, and be damned."\r\n\r\nSick as death, Eric slowly obeyed, but did not get through his task\r\nwithout many blows and curses.  He felt very ill; he had no means of\r\nwashing or cleaning himself; no brush, or comb or soap, or clean linen;\r\nand even his sleep seemed unrefreshful when the waking brought no change\r\nin his condition.  And then the whole life of the ship was odious to\r\nhim.  His sense of refinement was exquisitely keen, and now to be called\r\nBill, and kicked and cuffed about by these gross-minded men, and to hear\r\ntheir rough, coarse, drunken talk, and sometimes endure their still more\r\nintolerable patronage, filled him with deeply-seated loathing.  His\r\nwhole soul rebelled and revolted from them all, and, seeing his\r\nfastidious pride, not one of them showed him the least glimpse of open\r\nkindness, though he observed that one of them did seem to pity him in\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThings grew worse and worse.  The perils which he had to endure at\r\nfirst, when ordered about the rigging, were what affected him least; he\r\nlonged for death, and often contemplated flinging himself into those\r\ncold deep waves which he gazed on daily over the vessel\'s side.  Hope\r\nwas the only thing which supported him.  He had heard from one of the\r\ncrew that the vessel would be back in not more than six weeks, and he\r\nmade a deeply-seated resolve to escape the very first day that they\r\nagain anchored in an English harbour.\r\n\r\nThe homeward voyage was even more intolerable, for the cattle on board\r\ngreatly increased the amount of necessary menial and disgusting work\r\nwhich fell to his share, as well as made the atmosphere of the close\r\nlittle schooner twice as poisonous as before.  And to add to his\r\nmiseries, his relations with the crew got more and more unfavourable,\r\nand began to reach their climax.\r\n\r\nOne night the sailor who occupied the hammock next to his heard him\r\nwinding up his watch.  This he always did in the dark, as secretly and\r\nsilently as he could, and never looked at it, except when no one could\r\nobserve him; while, during the day, he kept both watch and chain\r\nconcealed in his trousers.\r\n\r\nNext morning the man made proposals to him to sell the watch, and tried\r\nby every species of threat and promise to extort it from him.  But the\r\nwatch had been his mother\'s gift, and he was resolute never to part with\r\nit into such hands.\r\n\r\n"Very well, you young shaver, I shall tell the skipper, and he\'ll soon\r\nget it out of you as your footing, depend on it."\r\n\r\nThe fellow was as good as his word, and the skipper demanded the watch\r\nas pay for Eric\'s feed, for he maintained that he\'d done no work, and\r\nwas perfectly useless.  Eric, grown desperate, still refused, and the\r\nman struck him brutally on the face, and at the same time aimed a kick\r\nat him, which he vainly tried to avoid.  It caught him on the knee-cap,\r\nand put it out, causing him the most excruciating agony.\r\n\r\nHe now could do no work whatever, not even swab the deck.  It was only\r\nwith difficulty that he could limp along, and every move caused him\r\nviolent pain.  He grew listless and dejected, and sat all day on the\r\nvessel\'s side, eagerly straining his eyes to catch any sight of land, or\r\ngazing vacantly into the weary sameness of sea and sky.\r\n\r\nOnce, when it was rather gusty weather, all hands were wanted, and the\r\nskipper ordered him to furl a sail.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," said Eric, in an accent of despair, barely stirring, and not\r\nlifting his eyes to the man\'s unfeeling face.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t, damn you!  Can\'t!  We\'ll soon see whether you can or no.  You do\r\nit, or _I_ shall have to mend your leg for you;" and he showered down a\r\nstorm of oaths.\r\n\r\nEric rose, and resolutely tried to mount the rigging, determined at\r\nleast to give no ground he could help to their wilful cruelty.  But the\r\neffort was vain, and with a sharp cry of suffering he dropped once more\r\non deck.\r\n\r\n"Cursed young brat!  I suppose you think we\'re going to bother ourselves\r\nwith you, and yer impudence, and get victuals for nothing.  It\'s all\r\nsham.  Here, Jim, tie him up."\r\n\r\nA stout sailor seized the unresisting boy, tied his hands together, and\r\nthen drew them up above his head, and strung them to the rigging.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t ye strip him first, damn you?" roared the skipper.\r\n\r\n"He\'s only got that blue shirt on, and that\'s soon mended," said the\r\nman, taking hold of the collar of the shirt on both sides, and tearing\r\nit open with a great rip.\r\n\r\nEric\'s white back was bare, his hands tied up, his head hanging, and his\r\ninjured leg slightly lifted from the ground.  "And now for some rope-pie\r\nfor the stubborn young lubber," said the skipper, lifting a bit of rope\r\nas he spoke.\r\n\r\nEric, with a shudder, heard it whistle through the air, and the next\r\ninstant it had descended on his back with a dull thump, rasping away a\r\nred line of flesh.  Now Eric knew for the first time the awful reality\r\nof intense pain; he had determined to utter no sound, to give no sign;\r\nbut when the horrible rope fell on him, griding across his back, and\r\nmaking his body literally creak under the blow, he quivered like an\r\naspen-leaf in every limb, and could not suppress the harrowing murmur,\r\n"O God, help me, help me."\r\n\r\nAgain the rope whistled in the air, again it grided across the boy\'s\r\nnaked back, and once more the crimson furrow bore witness to the violent\r\nlaceration.  A sharp shriek of inexpressible agony rang from his lips,\r\nso shrill, so heart-rending, that it sounded long in the memory of all\r\nwho heard it.  But the brute who administered the torture was untouched.\r\nOnce more, and again, the rope rose and fell, and under its marks the\r\nblood first dribbled, and then streamed from the white and tender skin.\r\n\r\nBut Eric felt no more; that scream had been the last effort of nature;\r\nhis head had dropped on his bosom, and though his limbs still seemed to\r\ncreep at the unnatural infliction, he had fainted away.\r\n\r\n"Stop, master, stop, if you don\'t want to kill the boy outright," said\r\nRoberts, one of the crew, stepping forward, while the hot flush of\r\nindignation burned through his tanned and weather-beaten cheek.  The\r\nsailors called him "Softy Bob," from that half-gentleness of disposition\r\nwhich had made him, alone of all the men, speak one kind or consoling\r\nword for the proud and lonely cabin-boy.\r\n\r\n"Undo him then, and be damned," growled the skipper, and rolled off to\r\ndrink himself drunk.\r\n\r\n"I doubt he\'s well-nigh done for him already," said Roberts, quickly\r\nuntying Eric\'s hands, round which the cords had been pulled so tight as\r\nto leave two blue rings round his wrists.  "Poor fellow, poor fellow!\r\nit\'s all over now," he murmured soothingly, as the boy\'s body fell\r\nmotionless into his arms, which he hastily stretched to prevent him from\r\ntumbling on the deck.\r\n\r\nBut Eric heard not and the man, touched with the deepest pity, carried\r\nhim down tenderly into his hammock, and wrapped him up in a clean\r\nblanket, and sat by him till the swoon should be over.\r\n\r\nIt lasted very long, and the sailor began to fear that his words had\r\nbeen prophetic.\r\n\r\n"How is the young varmint?" shouted the skipper, looking into the\r\nforecastle.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve killed him, I think."\r\n\r\nThe only answer was a volley of oaths; but the fellow was sufficiently\r\nfrightened to order Roberts to do all he could for his patient.\r\n\r\nAt last Eric woke with a moan.  To think was too painful, but the raw\r\nstate of his back, ulcerated with the cruelty he had undergone, reminded\r\nhim too bitterly of his situation.  Roberts did for him all that could\r\nbe done, but for a week Eric lay in that dark and foetid place, in the\r\nlanguishing of absolute despair.  Often and often the unbidden tears\r\nflowed from very weakness from his eyes, and in the sickness of his\r\nheart, and the torment of his wounded body, he thought that he should\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nBut youth is very strong, and it wrestled with despair, and agony, and\r\ndeath, and after a time, Eric could rise from his comfortless hammock.\r\nThe news that land was in sight first roused him, and with the help of\r\nRoberts, he was carried on deck, thankful, with childlike gratitude,\r\nthat God suffered him to breathe once more the pure air of heaven, and\r\nsit under the canopy of its gold-pervaded blue.  The breeze and the\r\nsunlight refreshed him, as they might a broken flower; and, with eyes\r\nup-raised, he poured from his heart a prayer of deep unspeakable\r\nthankfulness to a Father in heaven.\r\n\r\nYes! at last he had remembered his Father\'s home.  There, in the dark\r\nberth, where every move caused irritation, and the unclean atmosphere\r\nbrooded over his senses like lead, when his forehead burned, and his\r\nheart melted within him, and he had felt almost inclined to curse his\r\nlife, or even to end it by crawling up and committing himself to the\r\ndeep cold water which he heard rippling on the vessel\'s side; then, even\r\nthen, in that valley of the shadow of death, a Voice had come to him--a\r\nstill small voice--at whose holy and healing utterance Eric had bowed\r\nhis head, and had listened to the messages of God, and learned His will;\r\nand now, in humble resignation, in touching penitence, with solemn\r\nself-devotion, he had cast himself at the feet of Jesus, and prayed to\r\nbe helped, and guided, and forgiven.  One little star of hope rose in\r\nthe darkness of his solitude, and its rays grew brighter and brighter,\r\ntill they were glorious now.  Yes, for Jesus\' sake he was washed, he was\r\ncleansed, he was sanctified, he was justified, he would fear no evil,\r\nfor God was with him, and underneath were the everlasting arms.\r\n\r\nAnd while he sat there, undisturbed at last, and unmolested by harsh\r\nword or savage blow, recovering health with every breath of the sea\r\nwind, the skipper came up to him, and muttered something half like an\r\napology.\r\n\r\nThe sight of him, and the sound of his voice, made Eric shudder again,\r\nbut he listened meekly, and, with no flash of scorn or horror, put out\r\nhis hand to the man to shake.  There was something touching and noble in\r\nthe gesture, and thoroughly ashamed of himself for once, the fellow\r\nshook the proffered hand, and slunk away.\r\n\r\nThey entered the broad river at Southpool.\r\n\r\n"I must leave the ship when we get to port, Roberts," said Eric.\r\n\r\n"I doubt whether yon\'ll let you," answered Roberts, jerking his finger\r\ntowards the skipper\'s cabin.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"He\'ll be afeared you might take the law on him."\r\n\r\n"He needn\'t fear."\r\n\r\nRoberts only shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Then I must run away somehow.  Will you help me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that I will."\r\n\r\nThat very evening Eric escaped from the _Stormy Petrel_ unknown to all\r\nbut Roberts.  They were in the dock, and he dropped into the water in\r\nthe evening, and swam to the pier, which was only a yard or two distant;\r\nbut the effort almost exhausted his strength, for his knee was still\r\npainful, and he was very weak.\r\n\r\nWet and penniless, he knew not where to go, but spent the sleepless\r\nnight under an arch.  Early the next morning he went to a pawnbroker\'s,\r\nand raised 2 pounds 10 shillings on his watch, with which money he\r\nwalked straight to the railway station.\r\n\r\nIt was July, and the Roslyn summer holidays had commenced.  As Eric\r\ndragged his slow way to the station, he suddenly saw Wildney on the\r\nother side of the street.  His first impulse was to spring to meet him,\r\nas he would have done in old times.  His whole heart yearned towards\r\nhim.  It was six weeks now since Eric had seen one loving face, and\r\nduring all that time he had hardly heard one kindly word.  And now he\r\nsaw before him the boy with whom he had spent so many happy hours of\r\nschoolboy friendship, with whom he had gone through so many schoolboy\r\nadventures, and who, he believed, was still his friend.\r\n\r\nForgetful for the moment of his condition, Eric moved across the street.\r\nWildney was walking with his cousin, a beautiful girl, some four years\r\nolder than himself, whom he was evidently patronising immensely.  They\r\nwere talking very merrily, and Eric overheard the word Roslyn.  Like a\r\nlightning-flash the memory of the theft, the memory of his ruin, came\r\nupon him; he looked down at his dress--it was a coarse blue shirt, which\r\nRoberts had given him in place of his old one, and the back of it was\r\nstained and saturated with blood from his unhealed wounds; his trousers\r\nwere dirty, tarred, and ragged, and his shoes, full of holes, barely\r\ncovered his feet.  He remembered too that for weeks he had not been able\r\nto wash, and that very morning, as he saw himself in a looking-glass at\r\na shop window, he had been deeply shocked at his own appearance.  His\r\nface was white as a sheet, the fair hair matted and tangled, the eyes\r\nsunken and surrounded with a dark colour, and dead and lustreless.  No!\r\nhe could not meet Wildney as a sick and ragged sailor boy; perhaps even\r\nhe might not be recognised if he did.  He drew back, and hid himself\r\ntill the merry-hearted pair had passed, and it was almost with a pang of\r\njealousy that he saw how happy Wildney could be while _he_ was thus; but\r\nhe cast aside the unworthy thought at once.  "After all, how is poor\r\nCharlie to know what has happened to me?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nHOME AT LAST.\r\n\r\n  I will arise and go to my Father.\r\n\r\nEric Williams pursued his disconsolate way to the station, and found\r\nthat his money only just sufficed to get him something to eat during the\r\nday, and carry him third class by the parliamentary train to\r\nCharlesbury, the little station where he had to take the branch line to\r\nAyrton.\r\n\r\nHe got into the carriage, and sat in the far corner, hiding himself from\r\nnotice as well as he could.  The weary train--(it carried poor people\r\nfor the most part, so, of course, it could matter but little how tedious\r\nor slow it was!)--the weary train, stopping at every station, and often\r\nwaiting on the rail until it had been passed by trains that started four\r\nor five hours after it,--dragged its slow course through the fair\r\ncounties of England.  Many people got in and out of the carriage, which\r\nwas generally full, and some of them tried occasionally to enter into\r\nconversation with him.  But poor Eric was too sick and tired, and his\r\nheart was too full to talk much, and he contented himself with civil\r\nanswers to the questions put to him, dropping the conversation as soon\r\nas he could.\r\n\r\nAt six in the evening the train stopped at Charlesbury, and he got down.\r\n\r\n"Ticket," said the station-man.\r\n\r\nEric gave it, turning his head away, for the man knew him well from\r\nhaving often seen him there.  It was of no use; the man looked hard at\r\nhim, and then, opening his eyes wide, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"Well, I never! what, Master Williams of Fairholm, can that be you?"\r\n\r\n"Hush, John, hush yes, I am Eric Williams.  But don\'t say a word, that\'s\r\na good fellow; I\'m going on to Ayrton this evening."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, I _am_ hurt like to see you looking so ragged and poorly.\r\nLet me give you a bed to-night, and send you on by first train\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Oh no, thank you, John, I\'ve got no money, and--"\r\n\r\n"Tut, tut, sir I thought you\'d know me better nor that.  Proud I\'d be\r\nany day to do anything for Mrs Trevor\'s nephew, let alone a young\r\ngentleman like you.  Well, then, let me drive you, sir, in my little\r\ncart this evening."\r\n\r\n"No, thank you, John, never mind; you are very, very good, but," he\r\nsaid, and the tears were in his eyes, "I want to walk in alone\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\n"Well, God keep and bless you, sir," said the man, "for you look to need\r\nit," and touching his cap he watched the boy\'s painful walk across some\r\nfields to the main road.\r\n\r\n"Who\'d ha\' thought it, Jenny!" he said to his wife.  "There\'s that young\r\nMaster Williams, whom we\'ve always thought so noble like, just been here\r\nas ragged as ragged, and with a face the colour o\' my white signal\r\nflag."\r\n\r\n"Lawks!" said the woman; "well, well! poor young gentleman, I\'m afeard\r\nhe\'s been doing something bad."\r\n\r\nBalmily and beautiful the evening fell, as Eric, not without toil, made\r\nhis way along the road towards Ayrton, which was ten miles off.  The\r\nroad wound through the valley, across the low hills that encircled it,\r\nsometimes spanning or running parallel to the bright stream that had\r\nbeen the delight of Eric\'s innocent childhood.  There was something\r\nenjoyable at first to the poor boy\'s eyes, so long accustomed to the\r\nbarren sea, in resting once more on the soft undulating green of the\r\nsummer fields, which were intertissued with white and yellow flowers,\r\nlike a broidery of pearls and gold.  The whole scene was bathed in the\r\nexquisite light, and rich with the delicate perfumes of a glorious\r\nevening, which filled the sky over his head with every perfect gradation\r\nof rose and amber and amethyst, and breathed over the quiet landscape a\r\nsensation of unbroken peace.  But peace did not remain long in Eric\'s\r\nheart; each well-remembered landmark filled his soul with recollections\r\nof the days when he had returned from school, oh! how differently; and\r\nof the last time when he had come home with Vernon by his side.  "O\r\nVerny, Verny, dear little Verny, would to God that I were with you now!\r\nBut you are resting, Verny, in the green grave by Russell\'s side, and\r\nI--O God, be merciful to me now!"\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and the stars came out and shone by hundreds, and Eric\r\nwalked on by the moonlight.  But the exertion had brought on the pain in\r\nhis knee, and he had to sit down a long time by the roadside to rest.\r\nHe reached Ayrton at ten o\'clock, but even then he could not summon up\r\ncourage to pass through the town where he was so well-known, lest any\r\nstraggler should recognise him, and he took a detour in order to get to\r\nFairholm.  He did not arrive there till eleven o\'clock; and then he\r\ncould not venture into the grounds, for he saw through the trees of the\r\nshrubbery that there was no light in any of the windows, and it was\r\nclear that they were all gone to bed.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do?  He durst not disturb them so late at night.  He\r\nremembered that they would not have heard a syllable of or from him\r\nsince he had run away from Roslyn, and he feared the effect of so sudden\r\nan emotion as his appearance at that hour might excite.\r\n\r\nSo, under the starlight he lay down to sleep on a cold bank beside the\r\ngate, determining to enter early in the morning.  It was long before he\r\nslept, but at last weary nature demanded her privilege with importunity,\r\nand gentle sleep floated over him like a dark dewy cloud, and the sun\r\nwas high in heaven before he woke.\r\n\r\nIt was about half-past nine in the morning, and Mrs Trevor, with Fanny,\r\nwas starting to visit some of her poor neighbours, an occupation full of\r\nholy pleasure to her kind heart, and in which she had found more than\r\nusual consolation during the heavy trials which she had recently\r\nsuffered; for she had loved Eric and Vernon as a mother does her own\r\nchildren, and now Vernon, the little cherished jewel of her heart, was\r\ndead--Vernon was dead, and Eric, she feared not dead but worse than\r\ndead, guilty, stained, dishonoured.  Often had she thought to herself,\r\nin deep anguish of heart, "Our darling little Vernon dead--and Eric\r\nfallen and ruined!"\r\n\r\n"Look at that poor fellow asleep on the grass," said Fanny, pointing to\r\na sailor boy, who lay coiled up on the bank beside the gate.  "He has\r\nhad a rough bed, mother, if he has spent the night there, as I fear."\r\n\r\nMrs Trevor had grasped her arm.  "What is Flo doing?" she said,\r\nstopping, as the pretty little spaniel trotted up to the boy\'s reclining\r\nfigure, and began snuffing about it, and then broke into a quick short\r\nbark of pleasure, and fawned and frisked about him, and leapt upon him,\r\njoyously wagging his tail.\r\n\r\nThe boy rose with the dew wet from the flowers upon his hair;--he saw\r\nthe dog, and at once began playfully to fondle it, and hold its little\r\nsilken head between his hands; but as yet he had not caught sight of the\r\nTrevors.\r\n\r\n"It is--O good heavens it is Eric," cried Mrs Trevor, as she flew\r\ntowards him.  Another moment and he was in her arms, silent, speechless,\r\nwith long arrears of pent-up emotion.\r\n\r\n"Oh, my Eric, our poor, lost, wandering Eric--come home; you are\r\nforgiven, more than forgiven, my own darling boy.  Yes, I knew that my\r\nprayers would be answered; this is as though we received you from the\r\ndead."  And the noble lady wept upon his neck, and Eric, his heart\r\nshaken with accumulated feelings, clung to her and wept.\r\n\r\nDeeply did that loving household rejoice to receive back their lost\r\nchild.  At once they procured him a proper dress and a warm bath, and\r\ntended him with every gentle office of female ministering hands.  And in\r\nthe evening, when he told them his story in a broken voice of penitence\r\nand remorse, their love came to him like a sweet balsam, and he rested\r\nby them, "seated, and clothed, and in his right mind."\r\n\r\nThe pretty little room, fragrant with sweet flowers from the greenhouse,\r\nwas decorated with all the refinement of womanly taste, and its glass\r\ndoors opened on the pleasant garden.  It was long, long since Eric had\r\nseen anything like it, and he had never hoped to see it again.  "Oh,\r\ndearest aunty," he murmured, as he rested his weary head upon her lap,\r\nwhile he sat on a low stool at her feet, "O aunty, you will never know\r\nhow different this is from the foul horrible hold of the _Stormy\r\nPetrel_, and its detestable inmates."\r\n\r\nWhen Eric was dressed once more as a gentleman, and once more fed on\r\nnourishing and wholesome food, and was able to move once more about the\r\ngarden by Fanny\'s side, he began to recover his old appearance, and the\r\nsoft bloom came back to his cheek again, and the light to his blue eye.\r\nBut still his health gave most serious cause for apprehension; weeks of\r\nsemi-starvation, bad air, sickness, and neglect, followed by two nights\r\nof exposure and wet, had at last undermined the remarkable strength of\r\nhis constitution, and the Trevors soon became aware of the painful fact\r\nthat he was sinking to the grave, and had come home only to die.\r\n\r\nAbove all, there seemed to be some great load at his heart which he\r\ncould not remove; a sense of shame, the memory of his disgrace at\r\nRoslyn, and of the dark suspicion that rested on his name.  He avoided\r\nthe subject, and they were too kind to force it on him, especially as he\r\nhad taken away the bitterest part of their trial in remembering it, by\r\nexplaining to them that he was far from being so wicked in the matter of\r\nthe theft as they had at first been (how slowly and reluctantly!) almost\r\nforced to believe.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever heard--oh, how shall I put it?--have you ever heard,\r\naunty, how things went on at Roslyn after I ran away?" he asked one\r\nevening, with evident effort.\r\n\r\n"No, love, I have not.  After they had sent home your things, I heard no\r\nmore; only two most kind and excellent letters--one from Dr Rowlands,\r\nand one from your friend Mr Rose--informed me of what had happened\r\nabout you."\r\n\r\n"Oh, have they sent home my things?" he asked eagerly.  "There are very\r\nfew among them that I care about; but there is just one--"\r\n\r\n"I guessed it, my Eric, and, but that I feared to agitate you, should\r\nhave given it you before;" and she drew out of a drawer the little\r\nlikeness of Vernon\'s sweet childish face.\r\n\r\nEric gazed at it till the sobs shook him, and tears blinded his eyes.\r\n\r\n"Do not weep, my boy," said Mrs Trevor, kissing his forehead.  "Dear\r\nlittle Verny, remember, is in a land where God Himself wipes away all\r\ntears from off all eyes."\r\n\r\n"Is there anything else you would like?" asked Fanny, to divert his\r\npainful thoughts.  "I will get you anything in a moment."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Fanny dear, there is the medal I got for saving Russell\'s life,\r\nand one or two things which he gave me;--ah, poor Edwin, you never knew\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nHe told her what to fetch, and when she brought them it seemed to give\r\nhim great pleasure to recall his friends to mind by name, and speak of\r\nthem--especially of Montagu and Wildney.\r\n\r\n"I have a plan to please you, Eric," said Mrs Trevor.  "Shall I ask\r\nMontagu and Wildney here? we have plenty of room for them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, thank you," he said, with the utmost eagerness.  "Thank you,\r\ndearest aunt."  Then suddenly his countenance fell.  "Stop--shall we?--\r\nyes, yes, I am going to die soon, I know; let me see them before I die."\r\n\r\nThe Trevors did not know that he was aware of the precarious tenure of\r\nhis life, but they listened to him in silence, and did not contradict\r\nhim; and Mrs Trevor wrote to both the boys (whose directions Eric\r\nknew), telling them what had happened, and begging them, simply for his\r\nsake, to come and stay with her for a time.  She hinted clearly that it\r\nmight be the last opportunity they would ever have of seeing him.\r\n\r\nWildney and Montagu accepted the invitation and they arrived together at\r\nFairholm on one of the early autumn evenings.  They both greeted Eric\r\nwith the utmost affection; and he seemed never tired of pressing their\r\nhands, and looking at them again.  Yet every now and then a memory of\r\nsadness would pass over his face, like a dark ripple on the clear\r\nsurface of a lake.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, Monty," he said one evening, "all about what happened after I\r\nleft Roslyn."\r\n\r\n"Gladly, Eric; now that your name is cleared, there is--"\r\n\r\n"My name cleared!" said Eric, leaning forward eagerly.  "Did you say\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Eric.  Didn\'t you know, then, that the thief had been discovered?"\r\n\r\n"No," he murmured faintly, leaning back again; "oh, thank God, thank\r\nGod!  Do tell me all about it, Monty."\r\n\r\n"Well, Eric, I will tell you all from the beginning.  You may guess how\r\nutterly astonished we were in the morning, when we heard that you had\r\nrun away.  Wildney here was the first to discover it, for he went early\r\nto your bedroom--"\r\n\r\n"Dear little Sunbeam," interrupted Eric, resting his hand against\r\nWildney\'s cheek; but Wildney shook his fist at him when he heard the\r\nforbidden name.\r\n\r\n"He found the door locked," continued Montagu, "and called to you, but\r\nthere came no answer; this made us suspect the truth, and we were\r\ncertain of it when some one caught sight of the sheet hanging from your\r\nwindow.  The masters soon heard the report, and sent Carter to make\r\ninquiries, but they did not succeed in discovering anything definite\r\nabout you.  Then, of course, everybody assumed as a certainty that you\r\nwere guilty, and I fear that my bare assertion on the other side had\r\nlittle weight."\r\n\r\nEric\'s eyes glistened as he drank in his friend\'s story.\r\n\r\n"But, about a fortnight after, _more_ money and several other articles\r\ndisappeared from the studies, and all suspicion as to the perpetrator\r\nwas baffled; only now the boys began to admit that, after all, they had\r\nbeen premature in condemning you.  It was a miserable time; for every\r\none was full of distrust, and the more nervous boys were always afraid\r\nlest any one should on some slight grounds suspect _them_.  _Still_\r\nthings kept disappearing.\r\n\r\n"We found out at length that the time when the robberies were effected\r\nmust be between twelve and one, and it was secretly agreed that some one\r\nshould be concealed in the studies for a day or two during those hours.\r\nCarter undertook the office, and was ensconced in one of the big\r\ncupboards in a study which had not yet been touched.  On the third day\r\nhe heard some one stealthily mount the stairs.  The fellows were more\r\ncareful now, and used to keep their doors shut, but the person was\r\nprovided with keys, and opened the study in which Carter was.  He moved\r\nabout for a little time--Carter watching him through the key-hole, and\r\nprepared to spring on him before he could make his escape.  Not getting\r\nmuch, the man at last opened the cupboard door, where Carter had just\r\ntime to conceal himself behind a greatcoat.  The greatcoat took the\r\nplunderer\'s fancy; he took it down off the peg, and there stood Carter\r\nbefore him!  Billy--for it was he--stood absolutely confounded, as\r\nthough a ghost had suddenly appeared; and Carter, after enjoying his\r\nunconcealed terror, collared him, and hauled him off to the police\r\nstation.  He was tried soon after, and finally confessed that it was he\r\nwho had taken the cricket-money too; for which offences he was sentenced\r\nto transportation.  So, Eric, dear Eric, at last your name was cleared."\r\n\r\n"As I always knew it would be, dear old boy," said Wildney.\r\n\r\nMontagu and Wildney found plenty to make them happy at Fairholm, and\r\nwere never tired of Eric\'s society, and of his stories about all that\r\nbefell him on board the _Stormy Petrel_.  They perceived a marvellous\r\nchange in him.  Every trace of recklessness and arrogance had passed\r\naway; every stain of passion had been removed; every particle of\r\nhardness had been calcined in the flame of trial.  All was gentleness,\r\nlove, and dependence, in the once bright, impetuous, self-willed boy; it\r\nseemed as though the lightning of God\'s anger had shattered and swept\r\naway all that was evil in his heart and life, and left all his true\r\nexcellence, all the royal prerogatives of his character, pure and\r\nunscathed.  Eric, even in his worst days, was, as I well remember, a\r\nlovable and noble boy; but at this period there must have been something\r\nabout him, for which to thank God, something unspeakably winning and\r\nirresistibly attractive.  During the day, as Eric was too weak to walk\r\nwith them, Montagu and Wildney used to take boating and fishing\r\nexcursions by themselves, but in the evening the whole party would sit\r\nout reading and talking in the garden till twilight fell.  The two\r\nvisitors began to hope that Mrs Trevor had been mistaken, and that\r\nEric\'s health would still recover; but Mrs Trevor would not deceive\r\nherself with a vain hope, and the boy himself shook his head when they\r\ncalled him convalescent.\r\n\r\nTheir hopes were never higher than one evening about a week after their\r\narrival, when they were all seated, as usual, in the open-air, under a\r\nlime-tree on the lawn.  The sun was beginning to set, and the rain of\r\ngolden sunlight fell over them through the green ambrosial foliage of\r\nthe tree, whose pale blossoms were still murmurous with bees.  Eric was\r\nleaning back in an easy chair, with Wildney sitting on the grass beside\r\nhis feet, while Montagu, resting on one of the mossy roots, read to them\r\nthe _Midsummer Night\'s Dream_, and the ladies were busy with their work.\r\n\r\n"There--stop now," said Eric, "and let\'s sit out and talk until we see\r\nsome of `the fiery a\'es and o\'es of light\' which he talks of."\r\n\r\n"I\'d no idea Shakespeare was such immensely jolly reading," remarked\r\nWildney naively.  "I shall take to reading him through when I get home."\r\n\r\n"Do you remember, Eric," said Montagu, "how Rose used to chaff us in old\r\ndays for our ignorance of literature, and how indignant we used to be\r\nwhen he asked if we\'d ever heard of an obscure person called William\r\nShakespeare?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, very well," answered Eric, laughing heartily.  And in this strain\r\nthey continued to chat merrily, while the ladies enjoyed listening to\r\ntheir schoolboy mirth.\r\n\r\n"What a perfectly delicious evening.  It\'s almost enough to make me wish\r\nto live," said Eric.\r\n\r\nHe did not often speak thus; and it made them sad.  But Eric half sang,\r\nhalf murmured to himself, a hymn with which his mother\'s sweet voice had\r\nmade him familiar in their cottage-home at Ellan--\r\n\r\n  "There is a calm for those who weep,\r\n  A rest for weary pilgrims found;\r\n  They softly lie, and sweetly sleep,\r\n  Low in the ground.\r\n\r\n  "The storm that wrecks the winter sky,\r\n  No more disturbs their deep repose,\r\n  Than summer evening\'s latest sigh\r\n  That shuts the rose."\r\n\r\nThe last two lines lingered pleasantly in his fancy, and he murmured to\r\nhimself again in low tones--\r\n\r\n  "Than summer evening\'s latest sigh\r\n  That shuts the rose."\r\n\r\n"Oh, hush, hush, Eric!" said Wildney, laying his hand upon his friend\'s\r\nlips; "don\'t let\'s spoil to-night by forebodings."\r\n\r\nIt seemed, indeed, a shame to do so, for it was almost an awful thing to\r\nbe breathing the splendour of the transparent air, as the sun broadened\r\nand fell, and a faint violet glow floated over soft meadow and silver\r\nstream.  One might have fancied that the last rays of sunshine loved to\r\nlinger over Eric\'s face, now flushed with a hectic tinge of pleasure,\r\nand to light up sudden glories in his bright hair, which the wind just\r\nfanned off his forehead as he leaned back and inhaled the luxury of\r\nevening perfume, which the flowers of the garden poured on the gentle\r\nbreeze.  Ah, how sad that such scenes should be so rare and so\r\nshort-lived!\r\n\r\n"Hark--tirra-la-lirra-lirra!" said Wildney, "there goes the postman\'s\r\nhorn!  Shall I run and get the letter-bag as he passes the gate?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, do," they all cried; and the boy bounded off full of fun, greeting\r\nthe postman with such a burst of merry apostrophe, that the man shook\r\nwith laughing at him.\r\n\r\n"Here it is at last," said Wildney.  "Now, then, for the key.  Here\'s a\r\nletter for me, hurrah!--two for you, Miss Trevor--_what_ people you\r\nyoung ladies are for writing to each other!  None for you, Monty--oh\r\nyes!  I\'m wrong, here\'s one; but none for Eric."\r\n\r\n"I expected none," said Eric, sighing; but his eye was fixed earnestly\r\non one of Mrs Trevor\'s letters.  He saw that it was from India, and\r\ndirected in his father\'s hand.\r\n\r\nMrs Trevor caught his look.  "Shall I read it aloud to you, dear?  Do\r\nyou think you can stand it?  Remember it will be in answer to ours,\r\ntelling them of--"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, yes," he said eagerly, "do let me hear it."\r\n\r\nWith instinctive delicacy Montagu and Wildney rose, but Eric pressed\r\nthem to stay.  "It will help me to bear what mother says, if I see you\r\nby me," he pleaded.\r\n\r\nGod forbid that I should transcribe that letter.  It was written from\r\nthe depths of such sorrow as He only can fully sympathise with, who for\r\nthirty years pitched his tent in the valley of human misery.  By the\r\nformer mail Mrs Williams had heard of Verny\'s melancholy death; by the\r\nnext she had been told that her only other child, Eric, was not dead\r\nindeed, but a wandering outcast, marked with the brand of terrible\r\nsuspicion.  Let her agony be sacred; it was God who sent it, and He only\r\nenabled her to endure it.  With bent head, and streaming eyes, and a\r\nbreast that heaved involuntarily with fitful sobs, Eric listened as\r\nthough to his mother\'s voice, and only now and then he murmured low to\r\nhimself, "O mother, mother, mother--but I am forgiven now.  O mother,\r\nGod and man have forgiven me, and we shall be at peace again once more."\r\n\r\nMrs Trevor\'s eyes grew too dim with weeping to read it all, and Fanny\r\nfinished it.  "Here is a little note from your father, Eric, which\r\ndropped out when we opened dear aunt\'s letter.  Shall I read it too?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not now, love," said Mrs Trevor.  "Poor Eric is too tired and\r\nexcited already."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, let me glance at it myself, aunty," he said.  He opened it,\r\nread a line or two, and then, with a scream, fell back swooning, while\r\nit dropped out of his hands.\r\n\r\nTerrified, they picked up the fallen paper; it told briefly, in a few\r\nheart-rending words, that, after writing the letter, Mrs Williams had\r\nbeen taken ill; that her life was absolutely despaired of, and that,\r\nbefore the letter reached England, she would, in all human probability,\r\nbe dead.  It conveyed the impression of a soul resigned indeed, and\r\nhumble, but crushed down to the very earth with the load of mysterious\r\nbereavement and irretrievable sorrow.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have killed her, I have killed my mother!" said Eric, in a hollow\r\nvoice, when he came to himself.  "O God, forgive me, forgive me!"\r\n\r\nThey gathered round him they soothed, and comforted, and prayed for him;\r\nbut his soul refused comfort, and all his strength appeared to have been\r\nbroken down at once like a feeble reed.  At last a momentary energy\r\nreturned; his eyes were lifted to the gloaming heaven where a few stars\r\nhad already begun to shine, and a bright look illuminated his\r\ncountenance.  They listened deeply--"Yes, mother," he murmured, in\r\nbroken tones, "forgiven now, for Christ\'s dear sake.  Oh, Thou merciful\r\nGod!  Yes, there they are, and we shall meet again.  Verny--oh, happy,\r\nhappy at last--too happy!"\r\n\r\nThe sounds died away, and his head fell back; for a transient moment\r\nmore the smile and the brightness played over his fair features like a\r\nlambent flame.  It passed away, and Eric was with those he dearliest\r\nloved, in the land where there is no more curse.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dearest Eric, forgiven and happy now," sobbed Mrs Trevor; and her\r\ntears fell fast upon the dead boy\'s face, as she pressed upon it a long,\r\nlast kiss.\r\n\r\nBut Montagu, as he consoled the poignancy of Wildney\'s grief, was\r\nreminded by Mrs Trevor\'s words of that sweet German verse--\r\n\r\n  Doch sonst an keinem Orte\r\n  Wohnt die ersehnte Ruh,\r\n  Nur durch die dunkle Pforte\r\n  Seht man der Heimath zu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME TWO, CHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n  And hath that early hope been blessed with truth?\r\n  Hath he fulfilled the promise of his youth?\r\n  And borne unscathed through danger\'s stormy field\r\n  Honour\'s white wreath and virtue\'s stainless shield?\r\n  _Harrow.  A Prize Poem_.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was staying with Montagu.  He has succeeded to his\r\nfather\'s estate, and is the best loved landlord for miles around.  He\r\nintends to stand for the county at the next general election, and I\r\nhaven\'t the shadow of a doubt that he will succeed.  If he does,\r\nParliament will have gained a worthy addition.  Montagu has the very\r\nsoul of honour, and he can set off the conclusions of his vigorous\r\njudgment, and the treasures of his cultivated taste, with an eloquence\r\nthat rises to extraordinary grandeur when he is fulminating his scorn at\r\nany species of tyranny or meanness.\r\n\r\nIt was very pleasant to talk with him about our old schooldays in his\r\ncharming home.  We sate by the open window (which looks over his\r\ngrounds, and then across one of the richest plains in England) one long\r\nsummer evening, recalling all the vanished scenes and figures of the\r\npast, until we almost felt ourselves boys again.\r\n\r\n"I have just been staying at Trinity," said I, "and Owen, as I suppose\r\nyou know, is doing brilliantly.  He has taken a high first class, and\r\nthey have already elected him fellow and assistant tutor."\r\n\r\n"Is he liked?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, very much.  He always used to strike me at school as one of those\r\nfellows who are much more likely to be happy and successful as men than\r\nthey had ever any chance of being as boys.  I hope the _greatest_ things\r\nof him; but have you heard anything of Duncan lately?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he\'s just been gazetted as lieutenant.  I had a letter from him\r\nthe other day.  He\'s met two old Roslyn fellows, Wildney and Upton, the\r\nlatter of whom is now Captain Upton; he says that there are not two\r\nfiner or manlier officers in the whole service, and Wildney, as you may\r\neasily guess, is the favourite of the mess-room.  You know, I suppose,\r\nthat Graham is making a great start at the bar."\r\n\r\n"Is he?  I\'m delighted to hear it."\r\n\r\n"Yes.  He had a `mauvais sujet\' to defend the other day, in the person\r\nof our old enemy Brigson, who having been at last disowned by his\r\nrelations, is at present a policeman in London."\r\n\r\n"On the principle, I suppose, of `Set a thief to catch a thief\'" said\r\nMontagu, with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but he exemplifies the truth, `chassez le naturel, il revient an\r\ngalop;\' for he was charged with abetting a street fight between two\r\nboys, which very nearly ended fatally.  However, he was penitent, and\r\nGraham got him off with wonderful cleverness--"\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said Montagu, sighing, "there was _one_ who would have been the\r\npride of Roslyn had he lived.  Poor, poor Eric!"\r\n\r\nWe talked long of our loved friend; his bright face, his winning words,\r\nhis merry smile, came back to us with the memory of his melancholy fate,\r\nand a deep sadness fell over us.\r\n\r\n"Poor boy, he is at peace now," said Montagu; and he told me once more\r\nthe sorrowful particulars of his death.  "Shall I read you some verses,"\r\nhe asked, "which he must have composed, poor fellow, on board the\r\n_Stormy Petrel_ though he probably wrote them at Fairholm afterwards?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, do."\r\n\r\nAnd Montagu, in his pleasant musical voice, read me, with much feeling,\r\nthese lines, written in Eric\'s boyish hand, and signed with his name--\r\n\r\n  Alone, Yet Not Alone.\r\n\r\n  Alone, alone! ah, weary soul,\r\n  In all the world alone I stand,\r\n  With none to wed their hearts to mine,\r\n  Or link in mine a loving hand.\r\n\r\n  Ah! tell me not that I have those\r\n  Who own the ties of blood and name;\r\n  Or pitying friends who love me well,\r\n  And dear returns of friendship claim.\r\n\r\n  I have, I have! but none can heal,\r\n  And none shall see my inward woe,\r\n  And the deep thoughts within me veiled\r\n  No other heart but mine shall know.\r\n\r\n  And yet amid my sins and shames\r\n  The shield of God is o\'er me thrown\r\n  And \'neath its awful shade I feel\r\n  Alone,--yet, ah, not all alone!\r\n\r\n  Not all alone! and though my life\r\n  Be dragged along the stained earth,\r\n  O God!  I feel thee near me still,\r\n  And thank thee for my birth!\r\n\r\n  EW.\r\n\r\nMontagu gave me the paper, and I cherish it as my dearest memorial of my\r\nerring but noble schoolboy friend.\r\n\r\nKnowing how strong an interest Mr Rose always took in Eric, I gave him\r\na copy of these verses when last I visited him at his pleasant vicarage\r\nof Seaford, to which he was presented a year or two ago by Dr Rowlands,\r\nnow Bishop of Roslyn, who has also appointed him examining chaplain.  I\r\nsat and watched Mr Rose while he read them.  A mournful interest was\r\ndepicted on his face, his hand trembled a little, and I fancied that he\r\nbent his grey hair over the paper to hide a tear.  We always knew at\r\nschool that Eric was one of his greatest favourites, as indeed he and\r\nVernon were with all of us; and when the unhappy boy had run away\r\nwithout even having the opportunity for bidding any one farewell, Mr\r\nRose displayed such real grief, that for weeks he was like a man who\r\nwent mourning for a son.  After those summer holidays, when we returned\r\nto school, Montagu and Wildney brought back with them the intelligence\r\nof Eric\'s return to Fairholm, and of his death.  The news plunged many\r\nof us in sorrow, and when, on the first Sunday in chapel, Mr Rose\r\nalluded to this sad tale, there were few dry eyes among those who\r\nlistened to him.  I shall never forget that Sunday afternoon.  A deep\r\nhush brooded over us, and before the sermon was over, many a face was\r\nhidden to conceal the emotion which could not be suppressed.\r\n\r\n"I speak," said Mr Rose, "to a congregation of mourners, for one who\r\nbut a few weeks back was sitting among you as one of yourselves.  But,\r\nfor myself, I do _not_ mourn over his death.  Many a time have I mourned\r\nfor him in past days, when I marked how widely he went astray--but I do\r\nnot mourn now, for after his fiery trials he died penitent and happy,\r\nand at last his sorrows are over for ever, and the dreams of ambition\r\nhave vanished, and the fires of passion have been quenched, and for all\r\neternity the young soul is in the presence of its God.  Let none of you\r\nthink that his life has been wasted.  Possibly, had it pleased Heaven to\r\nspare him, he might have found great works to do among his fellow-men,\r\nand he would have done them as few else could.  But do not let us fancy\r\nthat our work must cease of necessity with our lives.  Not so; far\r\nrather must we believe that it will continue for ever, seeing that we\r\nare all partakers of God\'s unspeakable blessing, the common mystery of\r\nimmortality.  Perhaps it may be the glorious destiny of very many here\r\nto recognise that truth more fully when we meet and converse with our\r\ndear departed brother in a holier and happier world."\r\n\r\nI have preserved some faint echo of the words he used, but I can give no\r\nconception of the dignity and earnestness of his manner, or the intense\r\npathos of his tones.\r\n\r\nThe scene passed before me again as I looked at him, while he lingered\r\nover Eric\'s verses, and seemed lost in a reverie of thought.\r\n\r\nAt last he looked up and sighed.  "Poor Eric!--But no, I will not call\r\nhim poor!  After all, he is happier now than we.  You loved him well,"\r\nhe continued; "why do you not try and preserve some records of his\r\nlife?"\r\n\r\nThe suggestion took me by surprise, but I thought over it, and at once\r\nbegan to accomplish it.  My own reminiscences of Eric were numerous and\r\nvivid, and several of my old school-fellows and friends gladly supplied\r\nme with other particulars, especially the Bishop of Roslyn, Mr Rose,\r\nMontagu, and Wildney.  So the story of Eric\'s ruin has been told, and\r\ntold, as he would have wished it done, with simple truth.  Poor Eric!  I\r\ndo not fear that I have wronged your memory, and you, I know, would\r\nrejoice to think how sorrowful hours have lost something of their\r\nsorrow, as I wrote the scenes in so many of which we were engaged\r\ntogether in our schoolboy days.\r\n\r\nI visited Roslyn a short time ago, and walked for hours along the sands,\r\npicturing in my memory the pleasant faces, and recalling the joyous\r\ntones of the many whom I had known and loved.  Other boys were playing\r\nby the sea-side, who were strangers to me and I to them; and as I marked\r\nhow wave after wave rolled up the shore, with its murmur and its foam,\r\neach sweeping farther than the other, each effacing the traces of the\r\nlast, I saw an emblem of the passing generations, and was content to\r\nfind that my place knew me no more.\r\n\r\n  Ah me! the golden time:--\r\n  But its hours have passed away,\r\n  With the pure and bracing clime,\r\n  And the bright and merry day.\r\n  And the sea still laughs to the rosy shells ashore,\r\n  And the shore still shines in the lustre of the wave;\r\n  But the joyaunce and the beauty of the boyish days is o\'er,\r\n  And many of the beautiful lie quiet in the grave;\r\n  And he who comes again\r\n  Wears a brow of toil and pain,\r\n  And wanders sad and silent by the melancholy main.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Eric, or Little by Little, by Frederic W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
