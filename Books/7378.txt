Once this could not\r\nhave been done without more pain than I could brook, but the lapse of\r\ntime heals wounds, brings compensations, and, when the heart has ceased\r\nfrom aching and yearning, makes the memory of what once filled it a\r\ntreasure to be brought forward with joy and thankfulness.  Nor would it\r\nbe well that some of those mentioned in the coming narrative should be\r\nwholly forgotten, and their place know them no more.\r\n\r\nTo explain all, I must go back to a time long before the morning when my\r\nfather astonished us all by exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Poor old James Winslow!  So\r\nChantry House is came to us after all!\xe2\x80\x99  Previous to that event I do not\r\nthink we were aware of the existence of that place, far less of its being\r\na possible inheritance, for my parents would never have permitted\r\nthemselves or their family to be unsettled by the notion of doubtful\r\ncontingencies.\r\n\r\nMy father, John Edward Winslow, was a barrister, and held an appointment\r\nin the Admiralty Office, which employed him for many hours of the day at\r\nSomerset House.  My mother, whose maiden name was Mary Griffith, belonged\r\nto a naval family.  Her father had been lost in a West Indian hurricane\r\nat sea, and her uncle, Admiral Sir John Griffith, was the hero of the\r\nfamily, having been at Trafalgar and distinguished himself in cutting out\r\nexpeditions.  My eldest brother bore his name.  The second was named\r\nafter the Duke of Clarence, with whom my mother had once danced at a ball\r\non board ship at Portsmouth, and who had been rather fond of my uncle.\r\nIndeed, I believe my father\xe2\x80\x99s appointment had been obtained through his\r\ninterest, just about the time of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s birth.\r\n\r\nWe three boys had come so fast upon each other\xe2\x80\x99s heels in the Novembers\r\nof 1809, 10, and 11, that any two of us used to look like twins.  There\r\nis still extant a feeble water-coloured drawing of the trio, in nankeen\r\nfrocks, and long white trowsers, with bare necks and arms, the latter\r\ntwined together, and with the free hands, Griffith holding a bat,\r\nClarence a trap, and I a ball.  I remember the emulation we felt at\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x99s privilege of eldest in holding the bat.\r\n\r\nThe sitting for that picture is the only thing I clearly remember during\r\nthose earlier days.  I have no recollection of the disaster, which, at\r\nfour years old, altered my life.  The catastrophe, as others have\r\ndescribed it, was that we three boys were riding cock-horse on the\r\nbalusters of the second floor of our house in Montagu Place, Russell\r\nSquare, when we indulged in a general _m\xc3\xaal\xc3\xa9e_, which resulted in all\r\ntumbling over into the vestibule below.  The others, to whom I served as\r\ncushion, were not damaged beyond the power of yelling, and were quite\r\nrestored in half-an-hour, but I was undermost, and the consequence has\r\nbeen a curved spine, dwarfed stature, an elevated shoulder, and a\r\nshortened, nearly useless leg.\r\n\r\nWhat I do remember, is my mother reading to me Miss Edgeworth\xe2\x80\x99s _Frank\r\nand the little do Trusty_, as I lay in my crib in her bedroom.  I made\r\none of my nieces hunt up the book for me the other day, and the story\r\nbrought back at once the little crib, or the watered blue moreen canopy\r\nof the big four-poster to which I was sometimes lifted for a change; even\r\nthe scrawly pattern of the paper, which my weary eyes made into purple\r\nelves perpetually pursuing crimson ones, the foremost of whom always\r\nturned upside down; and the knobs in the Marseilles counterpane with\r\nwhich my fingers used to toy.  I have heard my mother tell that whenever\r\nI was most languid and suffering I used to whine out, \xe2\x80\x98O do read _Frank\r\nand the little dog Trusty_,\xe2\x80\x99 and never permitted a single word to be\r\nvaried, in the curious childish love of reiteration with its soothing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that any true picture of our parents, especially of my\r\nmother, will not do them justice in the eyes of the young people of the\r\npresent day, who are accustomed to a far more indulgent government, and\r\nyet seem to me to know little of the loyal veneration and submission with\r\nwhich we have, through life, regarded our father and mother.  It would\r\nhave been reckoned disrespectful to address them by these names; they\r\nwere through life to us, in private, papa and mamma, and we never\r\npresumed to take a liberty with them.  I doubt whether the petting,\r\npatronising equality of terms on which children now live with their\r\nparents be equally wholesome.  There was then, however, strong love and\r\nself-sacrificing devotion; but not manifested in softness or cultivation\r\nof sympathy.  Nothing was more dreaded than spoiling, which was viewed as\r\nidle and unjustifiable self-gratification at the expense of the objects\r\nthereof.  There were an unlucky little pair in Russell Square who were\r\nsaid to be \xe2\x80\x98spoilt children,\xe2\x80\x99 and who used to be mentioned in our nursery\r\nwith bated breath as a kind of monsters or criminals.  I believe our\r\nmother laboured under a perpetual fear of spoiling Griff as the eldest,\r\nClarence as the beauty, me as the invalid, Emily (two years younger) as\r\nthe only girl, and Martyn as the after-thought, six years below our\r\nsister.  She was always performing little acts of conscientiousness,\r\nlittle as we guessed it.\r\n\r\nThus though her unremitting care saved my life, and was such that she\r\nfinally brought on herself a severe and dangerous illness, she kept me in\r\norder all the time, never wailed over me nor weakly pitied me, never\r\npermitted resistance to medicine nor rebellion against treatment,\r\nenforced little courtesies, insisted on every required exertion, and\r\nhardly ever relaxed the rule of Spartan fortitude in herself as in me.\r\nIt is to this resolution on her part, carried out consistently at\r\nwhatever present cost to us both, that I owe such powers of locomotion as\r\nI possess, and the habits of exertion that have been even more valuable\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nWhen at last, after many weeks, nay months, of this watchfulness, she\r\nbroke down, so that her life was for a time in danger, the lack of her\r\nbracing and tender care made my life very trying, after I found myself\r\ntransported to the nursery, scarcely understanding why, accused of having\r\nby my naughtiness made ray poor mamma so ill, and discovering for the\r\nfirst time that I was a miserable, naughty little fretful being, and with\r\nnobody but Clarence and the housemaid to take pity on me.\r\n\r\nNurse Gooch was a masterful, trustworthy woman, and was laid under\r\ninjunctions not to indulge Master Edward.  She certainly did not err in\r\nthat respect, though she attended faithfully to my material welfare; but\r\nwoe to me if I gave way to a little moaning; and what I felt still\r\nharder, she never said \xe2\x80\x98good boy\xe2\x80\x99 if I contrived to abstain.\r\n\r\nI hear of carpets, curtains, and pictures in the existing nurseries.\r\nThey must be palaces compared with our great bare attic, where nothing\r\nwas allowed that could gather dust.  One bit of drugget by the fireside,\r\nwhere stood a round table at which the maids talked and darned stockings,\r\nwas all that hid the bare boards; the walls were as plain as those of a\r\nworkhouse, and when the London sun did shine, it glared into my eyes\r\nthrough the great unshaded windows.  There was a deal table for the meals\r\n(and very plain meals they were), and two or three big presses painted\r\nwhite for our clothes, and one cupboard for our toys.  I must say that\r\nGooch was strictly just, and never permitted little Emily, nor\r\nGriff\xe2\x80\x94though he was very decidedly the favourite,\xe2\x80\x94to bear off my beloved\r\nwoolly dog to be stabled in the houses of wooden bricks which the two\r\nwere continually constructing for their menagerie of maimed animals.\r\n\r\nGriff was deservedly the favourite with every one who was not, like our\r\nparents, conscientiously bent on impartiality.  He was so bright and\r\nwinning, he had such curly tight-rolled hair with a tinge of auburn, such\r\nmerry bold blue eyes, such glowing dimpled cheeks, such a joyous smile\r\nall over his face, and such a ringing laugh; he was so strong, brave, and\r\nsturdy, that he was a boy to be proud of, and a perfect king in his own\r\nway, making every one do as he pleased.  All the maids, and Peter the\r\nfootman, were his slaves, every one except nurse and mamma, and it was\r\nonly by a strong effort of principle that they resisted him; while he\r\ndragged Clarence about as his devoted though not always happy follower.\r\n\r\nAlas! for Clarence!  Courage was not in him.  The fearless infant boy\r\nchiefly dwells in conventional fiction, and valour seldom comes before\r\nstrength.  Moreover, I have come to the opinion that though no one\r\nthought of it at the time, his nerves must have had a terrible and\r\nlasting shock at the accident and at the sight of my crushed and deathly\r\ncondition, which occupied every one too much for them to think of\r\nsoothing or shielding him.  At any rate, fear was the misery of his life.\r\nDarkness was his horror.  He would scream till he brought in some one,\r\nthough he knew it would be only to scold or slap him.  The housemaid\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncloset on the stairs was to him an abode of wolves.  Mrs. Gatty\xe2\x80\x99s tale of\r\n_The Tiger in the Coal-box_ is a transcript of his feelings, except that\r\nno one took the trouble to reassure him; something undefined and horrible\r\nwas thought to wag in the case of the eight-day clock; and he could not\r\nbear to open the play cupboard lest \xe2\x80\x98something\xe2\x80\x99 should jump out on him.\r\nThe first time he was taken to the Zoological Gardens, the monkeys so\r\nterrified him that a bystander insisted on Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s carrying him away lest\r\nhe should go into fits, though Griffith was shouting with ecstasy, and\r\ncould hardly forgive the curtailment of his enjoyment.\r\n\r\nClarence used to aver that he really did see \xe2\x80\x98things\xe2\x80\x99 in the dark, but as\r\nhe only shuddered and sobbed instead of describing them, he was punished\r\nfor \xe2\x80\x98telling fibs,\xe2\x80\x99 though the housemaid used to speak under her breath\r\nof his being a \xe2\x80\x98Sunday child.\xe2\x80\x99  And after long penance, tied to his stool\r\nin the corner, he would creep up to me and whisper, \xe2\x80\x98But, Eddy, I really\r\ndid!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, it was only too well established in the nursery that Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nveracity was on a par with his courage.  When taxed with any\r\nmisdemeanour, he used to look round scared and bewildered, and utter a\r\nflat demur.  One scene in particular comes before me.  There were strict\r\nlaws against going into shops or buying dainties without express\r\npermission from mamma or nurse; but one day when Clarence had by some\r\nchance been sent out alone with the good natured housemaid, his fingers\r\nwere found sticky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, Master Clarence, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a naughty boy, eating of sweets,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nexclaimed stern Justice in a mob cap and frills.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 faltered the victim; but, alas!  Mrs. Gooch had only to thrust\r\nher hand into the little pocket of his monkey suit to convict him on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe maid was dismissed with a month\xe2\x80\x99s wages, and poor Clarence underwent\r\na strange punishment from my mother, who was getting about again by that\r\ntime, namely, a drop of hot sealing-wax on his tongue, to teach him\r\npractically the doom of the false tongue.  It might have done him good if\r\nthere had been sufficient encouragement to him to make him try to win a\r\nnew character, but it only added a fresh terror to his mind; and nurse\r\ngrew fond of manifesting her incredulity of his assertions by always\r\nreferring to Griff or to me, or even to little Emily.  What was worse,\r\nshe used to point him out to her congeners in the Square or the Park as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98such a false child.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was a very pretty little fellow, with a delicately rosy face, wistful\r\nblue eyes, and soft, light, wavy hair, and perhaps Gooch was jealous of\r\nhis attracting more notice than Griffith, and thought he posed for\r\nadmiration, for she used to tell people that no one could guess what a\r\nchild he was for slyness; so that he could not bear going out with her,\r\nand sometimes bemoaned himself to me.\r\n\r\nThere must be a good deal of sneaking in the undeveloped nature, for in\r\nthose days I was ashamed of my preference for Clarence, the naughty one.\r\nBut there was no helping it, he was so much more gentle than Griff, and\r\nwould always give up any sport that incommoded me, instead of calling me\r\na stupid little ape, and becoming more boisterous after the fashion of\r\nGriff.  Moreover, he fetched and carried for me unweariedly, and would\r\nplay at spillekins, help to put up puzzles, and enact little dramas with\r\nour wooden animals, such as Griff scorned as only fit for babies.  Even\r\nnurse allowed Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s merits towards me and little Emily, but always\r\nwith the sigh: \xe2\x80\x98If he was but as good in other respects, but them quiet\r\nones is always sly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGood Nurse Gooch!  We all owe much to her staunch fidelity, strong\r\ndiscipline, and unselfish devotion, but nature had not fitted her to deal\r\nwith a timid, sensitive child, of highly nervous temperament.  Indeed,\r\npersons of far more insight might have been perplexed by the fact that\r\nClarence was exemplary at church and prayers, family and\r\nprivate,\xe2\x80\x94whenever Griff would let him, that is to say,\xe2\x80\x94and would add\r\nprivate petitions of his own, sometimes of a startling nature.  He never\r\nscandalised the nursery, like Griff, by unseemly pranks on Sundays, nor\r\nby innovations in the habits of Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark, but was as much shocked as\r\nnurse when the lion was made to devour the elephant, or the lion and wolf\r\nfought in an embrace fatal to their legs.  Bible stories and Watt\xe2\x80\x99s hymns\r\nwere more to Clarence than even to me, and he used to ask questions for\r\nwhich Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s theology was quite insufficient, and which brought the\r\ninvariable answers, \xe2\x80\x98Now, Master Clarry, I never did!  Little boys should\r\nnot ask such questions!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the use of your pretending, sir!  It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall falseness, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is!  I hates hypercr\xc4\xabting!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t worrit,\r\nMaster Clarence; you are a very naughty boy to say such things.  I shall\r\nput you in the corner!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven nurse was scared one night when Clarence had a frightful screaming\r\nfit, declaring that he saw \xe2\x80\x98her\xe2\x80\x94her\xe2\x80\x94all white,\xe2\x80\x99 and even while being\r\nslapped reiterated, \xe2\x80\x98_her_, Lucy!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLucy was a kind elder girl in the Square gardens, a protector of little\r\ntimid ones.  She was known to be at that time very ill with measles, and\r\nin fact died that very night.  Both my brothers sickened the next day,\r\nand Emily and I soon followed their example, but no one had it badly\r\nexcept Clarence, who had high fever, and very much delirium each night,\r\ntalking to people whom he thought he saw, so as to make nurse regret her\r\nseverity on the vision of Lucy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nSCHOOLROOM DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98In the loom of life-cloth pleasure,\r\n       Ere our childish days be told,\r\n    With the warp and woof enwoven,\r\n       Glitters like a thread of gold.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94JEAN INGELOW.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I think my mother was the leading spirit in our household,\r\nthough she never for a moment suspected it.  Indeed, the chess queen must\r\nbe the most active on the home board, and one of the objects of her life\r\nwas to give her husband a restful evening when he came home to the six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner.  She also had to make both ends meet on an income which\r\nwould seem starvation at the present day; but she was strong, spirited,\r\nand managing, and equal to all her tasks till the long attendance upon\r\nme, and the consequent illness, forced her to spare herself\xe2\x80\x94a little\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nvery little.\r\n\r\nPreviously she had been our only teacher, except that my father read a\r\nchapter of the Bible with us every morning before breakfast, and heard\r\nthe Catechism on a Sunday.  For we could all read long before young\r\ngentlefolks nowadays can say their letters.  It was well for me, since\r\nbooks with a small quantity of type, and a good deal of frightful\r\nillustration, beguiled many of my weary moments.  You may see my special\r\nfavourites, bound up, on the shelf in my bedroom.  Crabbe\xe2\x80\x99s _Tales_,\r\n_Frank_, _the Parent\xe2\x80\x99s Assistant_, and later, Croker\xe2\x80\x99s _Tales from\r\nEnglish History_, Lamb\xe2\x80\x99s _Tales from Shakespeare_, _Tales of a\r\nGrandfather_, and the _Rival Crusoes_ stand pre-eminent\xe2\x80\x94also _Mrs.\r\nLeicester\xe2\x80\x99s School_, with the ghost story cut out.\r\n\r\nFairies and ghosts were prohibited as unwholesome, and not unwisely.  The\r\none would have been enervating to me, and the other would have been a\r\ndefinite addition to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s stock of horrors.  Indeed, one story had\r\nbeen cut out of Crabbe\xe2\x80\x99s _Tales_, and another out of an Annual presented\r\nto Emily, but not before Griff had read the latter, and the version he\r\nrelated to us probably lost nothing in the telling; indeed, to this day I\r\nrecollect the man, wont to slay the harmless cricket on the hearth, and\r\nin a storm at sea pursued by a gigantic cockroach and thrown overboard.\r\nThe night after hearing this choice legend Clarence was found crouching\r\nbeside me in bed for fear of the cockroach.  I am afraid the vengeance\r\nwas more than proportioned to the offence!\r\n\r\nEven during my illness that brave mother struggled to teach my brothers\xe2\x80\x99\r\ndaily lessons, and my father heard them a short bit of Latin grammar at\r\nhis breakfast (five was thought in those days to be the fit age to begin\r\nit, and fathers the fit teachers thereof).  And he continued to give this\r\nmorning lesson when, on our return from airing at Ramsgate after our\r\nrecovery from the measles, my mother found she must submit to transfer us\r\nto a daily governess.\r\n\r\nOld Miss Newton\xe2\x80\x99s attainments could not have been great, for her answers\r\nto my inquiries were decidedly funny, and prefaced _sotto voce_ with,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What a child it is!\xe2\x80\x99  But she was a good kindly lady, who had the\r\nfaculty of teaching, and of forestalling rebellion; and her little thin\r\ncorkscrew curls, touched with gray, her pale eyes, prim black silk apron,\r\nand sandalled shoes, rise before me full of happy associations of tender\r\nkindness and patience.  She was wise, too, in her own simple way.  When\r\nnurse would have forewarned her of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s failings in his own\r\nhearing, she cut the words short by declaring that she should like never\r\nto find out which was the naughty one.  And when habit was too strong,\r\nand he had denied the ink spot on the atlas, she persuasively wiled out a\r\nconfession not only to her but to mamma, who hailed the avowal as the\r\nbeginning of better things, and kissed instead of punishing.\r\n\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s queries had been snubbed into reserve, and I doubt whether\r\nMiss Newton\xe2\x80\x99s theoretic theology was very much more developed than that\r\nof Mrs. Gooch, but her practice and devotion were admirable, and she\r\nfostered religious sentiment among us, introducing little books which\r\nwere welcome in the restricted range of Sunday reading.  Indeed, Mrs.\r\nSherwood\xe2\x80\x99s have some literary merit, and her _Fairchild Family_ indulged\r\nin such delicious and eccentric acts of naughtiness as quite atoned for\r\nall the religious teaching, and fascinated Griff, though he was apt to be\r\nvery impatient of certain little affectionate lectures to which Clarence\r\nlistened meekly.  My father and mother were both of the old-fashioned\r\northodox school, with minds formed on Jeremy Taylor, Blair, South, and\r\nSecker, who thought it their duty to go diligently to church twice on\r\nSunday, communicate four times a year (their only opportunities), after\r\ngrave and serious preparation, read a sermon to their household on Sunday\r\nevenings, and watch over their children\xe2\x80\x99s religious instruction, though\r\nin a reserved undemonstrative manner.  My father always read one daily\r\nchapter with us every morning, one Psalm at family prayers, and my mother\r\nmade us repeat a few verses of Scripture before our other studies began;\r\nbesides which there was special teaching on Sunday, and an abstinence\r\nfrom amusements, such as would now be called Sabbatarian, but a walk in\r\nthe Park with papa was so much esteemed that it made the day a happy and\r\nhonoured one to those who could walk.\r\n\r\nThere was little going into society, comparatively, for people in our\r\nstation,\xe2\x80\x94solemn dinner-parties from time to time\xe2\x80\x94two a year, did we give,\r\nand then the house was turned upside down,\xe2\x80\x94and now and then my father\r\ndined out, or brought a friend home to dinner; and there were so-called\r\nmorning calls in the afternoon, but no tea-drinking.  For the most part\r\nthe heads of the family dined alone at six, and afterwards my father read\r\naloud some book of biography or travels, while we children were expected\r\nto employ ourselves quietly, threading beads, drawing, or putting up\r\npuzzles, and listen or not as we chose, only not interrupt, as we sat at\r\nthe big, central, round, mahogany table.  To this hour I remember\r\nportions of Belzoni\xe2\x80\x99s Researches and Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s terrible American\r\nadventures, and they bring back tones of my father\xe2\x80\x99s voice.  As an\r\nauthority \xe2\x80\x98papa\xe2\x80\x99 was seldom invoked, except on very serious occasions,\r\nsuch as Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s audacity, Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s falsehood, or my obstinacy; and\r\nthen the affair was formidable, he was judicial and awful, and, though he\r\nwould graciously forgive on signs of repentance, he never was\r\nsympathetic.  He had not married young, and there were forty years or\r\nmore between him and his sons, so that he had left too far behind him the\r\nfeelings of boyhood to make himself one with us, even if he had thought\r\nit right or dignified to do so,\xe2\x80\x94yet I cannot describe the depth of the\r\nrespect and loyalty he inspired in us nor the delight we felt in a word\r\nof commendation or a special attention from him.\r\n\r\nThe early part of Miss Newton\xe2\x80\x99s rule was unusually fertile in such\r\npleasures, and much might have been spared, could Clarence have been\r\nlonger under her influence; but Griff grew beyond her management, and was\r\ntaunted by \xe2\x80\x98fellows in the Square\xe2\x80\x99 into assertions of manliness, such as\r\nkicking his heels, stealing her odd little fringed parasol, pitching his\r\nbooks into the area, keeping her in misery with his antics during their\r\nwalks, and finally leading Clarence off after Punch into the Rookery of\r\nSt. Giles\xe2\x80\x99s, where she could not follow, because Emily was in her charge.\r\n\r\nThis was the crisis.  She had to come home without the boys, and though\r\nthey arrived long before any of the authorities knew of their absence,\r\nshe owned with tears that she could not conscientiously be responsible\r\nany longer for Griffith,\xe2\x80\x94who not only openly defied her authority, but\r\nhad found out how little she knew, and laughed at her.  I have reason to\r\nbelieve also that my mother had discovered that she frequented the\r\npreachings of Rowland Hill and Baptist Noel; and had confiscated some\r\nunorthodox tracts presented to the servants, thus being alarmed lest she\r\nshould implant the seeds of dissent.\r\n\r\nParting with her after four years under her was a real grief.  Even Griff\r\nwas fond of her; when once emancipated, he used to hug her and bring her\r\nremarkable presents, and she heartily loved her tormentor.  Everybody\r\ndid.  It remained a great pleasure to get her to spend an evening with us\r\nwhile the elders were gone out to dinner; nor do I think she ever did us\r\nanything but good, though I am afraid we laughed at \xe2\x80\x98Old Newton\xe2\x80\x99 as we\r\ngrew older and more conceited.  We never had another governess.  My\r\nmother read and enforced diligence on Emily and me, and we had masters\r\nfor different studies; the two boys went to school; and when Martyn began\r\nto emerge from babyhood, Emily was his teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nWIN AND SLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n   \xe2\x80\x98The rude will shuffle through with ease enough:\r\n   Great schools best suit the sturdy and the rough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                   COWPER.\r\n\r\nAT school Griffith was very happy, and brilliantly successful, alike in\r\nstudy and sport, though sports were not made prominent in those days, and\r\ntriumphs in them were regarded by the elders with doubtful pride, lest\r\nthey should denote a lack of attention to matters of greater importance.\r\nAll his achievements were, however, poured forth by himself and Clarence\r\nto Emily and me, and we felt as proud of them as if they had been our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nClarence was industrious, and did not fail in his school work, but when\r\nhe came home for the holidays there was a cowed look about him, and\r\nprivate revelations were made over my sofa that made my flesh creep.  The\r\nscars were still visible, caused by having been compelled to grasp the\r\nbars of the grate bare-handed; and, what was worse, he had been suspended\r\noutside a third story window by the wrists, held by a schoolfellow of\r\nthirteen!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what was Griff about?\xe2\x80\x99 I demanded, with hot tears of indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Win!\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s what they call him, and me Slow\xe2\x80\x94he said it would do me\r\ngood.  But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it did, Eddy.  It only makes my heart beat fit\r\nto choke me whenever I go near the passage window.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI could only utter a vain wish that I had been there and able to fight\r\nfor him, and I attacked Griff on the subject on the first opportunity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 was his answer, \xe2\x80\x98it is only what all fellows have to bear if\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no pluck in them.  They tried it on upon me, you know, but I soon\r\nshowed them it would not do\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94with the cock of the nose, the flash of the\r\neyes, the clench of the fist, that were peculiarly Griff\xe2\x80\x99s own; and when\r\nI pleaded that he might have protected Clarence, he laughed scornfully.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As to Slow, wretched being, a fellow can\xe2\x80\x99t help bullying him.  It comes\r\nas natural as to a cat with a mouse.\xe2\x80\x99  On further and reiterated\r\npleadings, Griff declared, first, that it was the only thing to do Slow\r\nany good, or make a man of him; and next, that he heartily wished that\r\nWinslow junior had been Miss Clara at once, as the fellows called him\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas really hard on him (Griff) to have such a sneaking little coward tied\r\nto him for a junior!\r\n\r\nI particularly resented the term Slow, for Clarence had lately been the\r\nforemost of us in his studies; but the idea that learning had anything to\r\ndo with the matter was derided, and as time went on, there was vexation\r\nand displeasure at his progress not being commensurate with his\r\nabilities.  It would have been treason to schoolboy honour to let the\r\nelders know that though a strong, high-spirited popular boy like \xe2\x80\x98Win\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmight venture to excel big bullying dunces, such fair game as poor \xe2\x80\x98Slow\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncould be terrified into not only keeping below them, but into doing their\r\nwork for them.  To him Cowper\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Tirocinium\xe2\x80\x99 had only too much sad truth.\r\n\r\nAs to his old failing, there were no special complaints, but in those\r\npre-Arnoldian times no lofty code of honour was even ideal among\r\nschoolboys, or expected of them by masters; shuffling was thought\r\nnatural, and allowances made for faults in indolent despair.\r\n\r\nMy mother thought the Navy the proper element of boyhood, and her uncle\r\nthe Admiral promised a nomination,\xe2\x80\x94a simple affair in those happy days,\r\ninvolving neither examination nor competition.  Griffith was, however,\r\none of those independent boys who take an aversion to whatever is forced\r\non them as their fate.  He was ready and successful with his studies, a\r\nhero among his comrades, and preferred continuing at school to what he\r\npronounced, on the authority of the nautical tales freely thrown in our\r\nway, to be the life of a dog, only fit for the fool of the family;\r\nbesides, he had once been out in a boat, tasted of sea-sickness, and been\r\nlaughed at.  My father was gratified, thinking his brains too good for a\r\nmidshipman, and pleased that he should wish to tread in his own steps at\r\nHarrow and Oxford, and thus my mother could not openly regret his\r\ndegeneracy when all the rest of us were crazy over _Tom Cringle\xe2\x80\x99s Log_,\r\nand ready to envy Clarence when the offer was passed on to him, and he\r\nappeared in the full glory of his naval uniform.  Not much choice had\r\nbeen offered to him.  My mother would have thought it shameful and\r\nungrateful to have no son available, my father was glad to have the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofession fixed, and he himself was rejoiced to escape from the miseries\r\nhe knew only too well, and ready to believe that uniform and dirk would\r\nmake a man of him at once, with all his terrors left behind.  Perhaps the\r\nchief drawback was that the ladies _would_ say, \xe2\x80\x98What a darling!\xe2\x80\x99\r\naffording Griff endless opportunities for the good-humoured mockery by\r\nwhich he concealed his own secret regrets.  Did not even Selina Clarkson,\r\nwhose red cheeks, dark blue eyes, and jetty profusion of shining curls,\r\nwere our notion of perfect beauty, select the little naval cadet for her\r\npartner at the dancing master\xe2\x80\x99s ball?\r\n\r\nIn the first voyage, a cruise in the Pacific, all went well.  The good\r\nAdmiral had carefully chosen ship and captain; there were an excellent\r\nset of officers, a good tone among the midshipmen, and Clarence, who was\r\nonly twelve years old, was constituted the pet of the cockpit.  One lad\r\nin especial, Coles by name, attracted by Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s pleasant gentleness,\r\nand impelled by the generosity that shields the weak, became his guardian\r\nfriend, and protected him from all the roughnesses in his power.  If\r\nthere were a fault in that excellent Coles, it was that he made too much\r\nof a baby of his _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_, and did not train him to shift for himself:\r\nbut wisdom and moderation are not characteristics of early youth.  At\r\nhome we had great enjoyment of his long descriptive letters, which came\r\nunder cover to our father at the Admiralty, but were chiefly intended for\r\nmy benefit.  All were proud of them, and great was my elation when I\r\nheard papa relate some fact out of them with the preface, \xe2\x80\x98My boy tells\r\nme, my boy Clarence, in the _Calypso_; he writes a capital letter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHow great was our ecstasy when after three years and a half we had him at\r\nhome again; handsome, vigorous, well-grown, excellently reported of,\r\nfully justifying my mother\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that the sea would make a man of\r\nhim.  There was Griffith in the fifth form and a splendid cricketer, but\r\nClarence could stand up to him now, and Harrovian exploits were tame\r\nbeside stories of sharks and negroes, monkeys and alligators.  There was\r\none in particular, about a whole boat\xe2\x80\x99s crew sitting down on what they\r\nthought was a fallen tree, but which suddenly swept them all over on\r\ntheir faces, and turned out to be a boa-constrictor, and would have\r\nembraced one of them if he had not had the sail of the boat coiled round\r\nthe mast, and palmed off upon him, when he gorged it contentedly, and\r\nbeing found dead on the next landing, his skin was used to cover the\r\ncaptain\xe2\x80\x99s sea-chest.  Clarence declined to repeat this tale and many\r\nothers before the elders, and was displeased with Emily for referring to\r\nit in public.  As to his terrors, he took it for granted that an officer\r\nof H.M.S. _Calypso_, had left them behind, and in fact, he naturally\r\nforgot and passed over what he had not been shielded from, while his\r\nhereditary love of the sea really made those incidental to his profession\r\nmuch more endurable than the bullying he had undergone at school.\r\n\r\nWe were very happy that Christmas, and very proud of our boys.  One\r\nevening we were treated to a box at the pantomime, and even I was able to\r\ngo to it.  We put our young sailor and our sister in the forefront, and\r\nbelieved that every one was as much struck with them as with the\r\nwonderful transformations of Goody-Two-Shoes under the wand of Harlequin.\r\nBrother-like, we might tease our one girl, and call her an affected\r\nlittle pussy cat, but our private opinion was that she excelled all other\r\ndamsels with her bright blue eyes and pretty curling hair, which had the\r\nsame chestnut shine as Griff\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94enough to make us correct possible vanity\r\nby terming it red, though we were ready to fight any one else who\r\npresumed to do so.  Indeed Griff had defended its hue in single combat,\r\nand his eye was treated for it with beefsteak by Peter in the pantry.  We\r\nwere immensely, though silently, proud of her in her white embroidered\r\ncambric frock, red sash and shoes, and coral necklace, almost an\r\nheirloom, for it had been brought from Sicily in Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s days by my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s poor young father.  How parents and doctors in these days would\r\nhave shuddered at her neck and arms, bare, not only in the evening, but\r\nby day!  When she was a little younger she could so shrink up from her\r\nclothes that Griff, or little Martyn, in a mischievous mood, would put\r\nthings down her back, to reappear below her petticoats.  Once it was a\r\ndead wasp, which descended harmlessly the length of her spine!  She was a\r\ngood-humoured, affectionate, dear sister, my valued companion, submitting\r\npatiently to be eclipsed when Clarence was present, and everything to me\r\nin his absence.  Sturdy little Martyn too, was held by us to be the most\r\npromising of small boys.  He was a likeness of Clarence, only stouter,\r\nhardier, and without the delicate, girlish, wistful look; imitating Griff\r\nin everything, and rather a heavy handful to Emily and me when left to\r\nour care, though we were all the more proud of his high spirit, and were\r\nfast becoming a mutual admiration society.\r\n\r\nWhat then were our feelings when Griff, always fearless, dashed to the\r\nrescue of a boy under whom the ice had broken in St. James\xe2\x80\x99 Park, and\r\nheld him up till assistance came?  Martyn, who was with him, was sent\r\nhome to fetch dry clothes and reassure my mother, which he did by dashing\r\nupstairs, shouting, \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s mamma?  Here\xe2\x80\x99s Griff been into the water and\r\npulled out a boy, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he is drowned; but he looks\xe2\x80\x94oh!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEven after my mother had elicited that Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s _he_ meant the boy, and\r\nnot Griff, she could not rest without herself going to see that our\r\neldest was unhurt, greet him, and bring him home.  What happy tears stood\r\nin her eyes, how my father shook hands with him, how we drank his health\r\nafter dinner, and how ungrateful I was to think Clarence deserved his\r\nname of Slow for having stayed at home to play chess with me because my\r\nback was aching, when he might have been winning the like honours!  How\r\nred and gruff and shy the hero looked, and how he entreated no one to say\r\nany more about it!\r\n\r\nHe would not even look publicly at the paragraph about it in the paper,\r\nonly vituperating it for having made him into \xe2\x80\x98a juvenile Etonian,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhoping no one from Harrow would guess whom it meant.\r\n\r\nI found that paragraph the other day in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s desk, folded over the\r\ncase of the medal of the Royal Humane Society, which Griff affected to\r\ndespise, but which, when he was well out of the way, used to be exhibited\r\non high days and holidays.  It seems now like the boundary mark of the\r\ngolden days of our boyhood, and unmitigated hopes for one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nUBI LAPSUS, QUID FECI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Clarence is come\xe2\x80\x94false, fleeting, perjured Clarence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                       _King Richard III_.\r\n\r\nTHERE was much stagnation in the Navy in those days in the reaction after\r\nthe great war; and though our family had fair interest at the Admiralty,\r\nit was seven months before my brother went to sea again.  To me they were\r\nvery happy months, with my helper of helpers, companion of companions,\r\nwho made possible to me many a little enterprise that could not be\r\nattempted without him.  My father made him share my studies, and thus\r\nthey became doubly pleasant.  And oh, ye boys! who murmur at the Waverley\r\nNovels as a dry holiday task, ye may envy us the zest and enthusiasm with\r\nwhich we devoured them in their freshness.  Strangely enough, the last\r\nthat we read together was the _Fair Maid of Perth_.\r\n\r\nClarence and his friend Coles longed to sail together again, but Coles\r\nwas shelved; and when Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s appointment came at last, it was to the\r\nbrig _Clotho_, Commander Brydone, going out in the Mediterranean Fleet,\r\nunder Sir Edward Codrington.  My mother did not like brigs, and my father\r\ndid not like what he heard of the captain; but there had been jealous\r\nmurmurs about appointments being absorbed by sons of officials\xe2\x80\x94he durst\r\nnot pick and choose; and the Admiral pronounced that if the lad had been\r\nspoilt on board the _Calypso_, it was time for him to rough it\xe2\x80\x94a dictum\r\nwhence there was no appeal.\r\n\r\nHalf a year later the tidings of the victory of Navarino rang through\r\nEurope, and were only half welcome to the conquerors; but in our\r\nhousehold it is connected with a terrible recollection.  Though more than\r\nhalf a century has rolled by, I shrink from dwelling on the shock that\r\nfell on us when my father returned from Somerset House with such a\r\ncountenance that we thought our sailor had fallen; but my mother could\r\nbrook the fact far less than if her son had died a gallant death.  The\r\n_Clotho_ was on her way home, and Midshipman William Clarence Winslow was\r\nto be tried by court-martial for insubordination, disobedience, and\r\ndrunkenness.  My mother was like one turned to stone.  She would hardly\r\ngo out of doors; she could scarcely bring herself to go to church; she\r\nwould have had my father give up his situation if there had been any\r\nother means of livelihood.  She could not talk; only when my father\r\nsighed, \xe2\x80\x98We should never have put him into the Navy,\xe2\x80\x99 she hotly replied,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How was I to suppose that a son of mine would be like that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEmily cried all day and all night.  Some others would have felt it a\r\nrelief to have cried too.  In more furious language than parents in those\r\ndays tolerated, Griff wrote to me his utter disbelief, and how he had\r\npunched the heads of fellows who presumed to doubt that it was not all a\r\nrascally, villainous plot.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came my father went down by the night mail to Portsmouth.\r\nHe could scarcely bear to face the matter; but, as he said, he could not\r\nhave it on his conscience if the boy did anything desperate for want of\r\nsome one to look after him.  Besides, there might be some explanation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Explanation,\xe2\x80\x99 said my mother bitterly.  \xe2\x80\x98That there always is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98explanation\xe2\x80\x99 was this\xe2\x80\x94I have put together what came out in evidence,\r\nwhat my father and the Admiral heard from commiserating officers, and\r\nwhat at different times I learned from Clarence himself.  Captain Brydone\r\nwas one of the rough old description of naval men, good sailors and stern\r\ndisciplinarians, but wanting in any sense of moral duties towards their\r\nship\xe2\x80\x99s company.  His lieutenant was of the same class, soured, moreover,\r\nby tardy promotion, and prejudiced against a gentleman-like, fair-faced\r\nlad, understood to have interest, and bearing a name that implied it.  Of\r\nthe other two midshipmen, one was a dull lad of low stamp, the other a\r\nyouth of twenty, a born bully, with evil as well as tyrannical\r\npropensities;\xe2\x80\x94the crew conforming to severe discipline on board, but\r\notherwise wild and lawless.  In such a ship a youth with good habits,\r\nsensitive conscience, and lack of moral or physical courage, could not\r\nbut lead a life of misery, losing every day more of his self-respect and\r\nspirit as he was driven to the evil he loathed, dreading the\r\nconsequences, temporal and eternal, with all his soul, yet without\r\nresolution or courage to resist.\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, the battle of Navarino came on suddenly, almost by\r\nmistake; and though it is perhaps no excuse, the hurly-burly and horror\r\nburst upon him at unawares.  Though the English loss was comparatively\r\nvery small, the _Clotho_ was a good deal exposed, and two men were\r\nkilled\xe2\x80\x94one so close to Clarence that his clothes were splashed with\r\nblood.  This entirely unnerved him; he did not even know what he did, but\r\nhe was not to be found when required to carry an order, and was\r\ndiscovered hidden away below, shuddering, in his berth, and then made\r\nsome shallow excuse about misunderstanding orders.  Whether this would\r\nhave been brought up against him under other circumstances, or whether it\r\nwould have been remembered that great men, including Charles V. and Henri\r\nIV., have had their _moment de peur_, I cannot tell; but there were other\r\ncharges.  I cannot give date or details.  There is no record among the\r\npapers before me; and I can only vaguely recall what could hardly be read\r\nfor the sense of agony, was never discussed, and was driven into the most\r\noblivious recesses of the soul fifty years ago.  There was a story about\r\nhaving let a boat\xe2\x80\x99s crew, of which he was in charge, get drunk and\r\nover-stay their time.  One of them deserted; and apparently prevarication\r\nran to the bounds of perjury, if it did not overpass them.  (N.B.\xe2\x80\x94Seeing\r\nseamen flogged was one of the sickening horrors that haunted Clarence in\r\nthe _Clotho_.)  Also, when on shore at Malta with the young man whose\r\nname I will not record\xe2\x80\x94his evil genius\xe2\x80\x94he was beguiled or bullied into a\r\nwine-shop, and while not himself was made the cat\xe2\x80\x99s-paw of some insolent\r\npractical joke on the lieutenant; and when called to account, was so\r\nbewildered and excited as to use unpardonable language.\r\n\r\nWhatever it might have been in detail, so much was proved against him\r\nthat he was dismissed his ship, and his father was recommended to\r\nwithdraw him from the service, as being disqualified by want of nerve.\r\nAlso, it was added more privately, that such vicious tendencies needed\r\nhome restraint.  The big bully, his corrupter, bore witness against him,\r\nbut did not escape scot free, for one of the captains spoke to him in\r\nscathing tones of censure.\r\n\r\nWhenever my mother was in trouble, she always re-arranged the furniture,\r\nand a family crisis was always heralded by a revolution of chairs,\r\ntables, and sofas.  She could not sit still under suspense, and, during\r\nthese terrible days the entire house underwent a setting to rights.\r\nEmily attended upon her, and I sat and dusted books.  No doubt it was\r\nmuch better for us than sitting still.  My father\xe2\x80\x99s letter came by the\r\nmorning mail, telling us of the sentence, and that he and our poor\r\nculprit, as he said, would come home by the Portsmouth coach in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nOne room was already in order when Sir John Griffith kindly came to see\r\nwhether he could bring any comfort to a spirit which would infinitely\r\nhave preferred death to dishonour, and was, above all, shocked at the\r\nlack of physical courage.  Never had I liked our old Admiral so well as\r\nwhen I heard how his chief anger was directed against the general\r\nmismanagement, and the cruelty of blighting a poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s life when not\r\nyet seventeen.  His father might have been warned to remove him without\r\nthe public scandal of a court-martial and dismissal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The guilt and shame would have been all the same to us,\xe2\x80\x99 said my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Come, Mary, don\xe2\x80\x99t be hard on the poor fellow.  In quiet times like these\r\na poor boy can\xe2\x80\x99t look over the wall where one might have stolen a horse,\r\nay, or a dozen horses, when there was something else to think about!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You would not have forgiven such a thing, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It never would have happened under me, or in any decently commanded\r\nship!\xe2\x80\x99 he thundered.  \xe2\x80\x98There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fault to be found with him in the\r\n_Calypso_.  What possessed Winslow to let him sail with Brydone?  But the\r\nservice is going,\xe2\x80\x99 etc. etc., he ran on\xe2\x80\x94forgetting that it was he himself\r\nwho had been unwilling, perhaps rightly, to press the Duke of Clarence\r\nfor an appointment to a crack frigate for his namesake.  However, when he\r\ntook leave he repeated, as he kissed my mother, \xe2\x80\x98Mind, Mary, don\xe2\x80\x99t be set\r\nagainst the lad.  That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to make \xe2\x80\x99em desperate, and he is a mere\r\nboy, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor mother, it was not so much hardness as a wounded spirit that made\r\nher look so rigid.  It might have been better if the return could have\r\nbeen delayed so as to make her yearn after her son, but there was nowhere\r\nfor him to go, and the coach was already on its way.  How strange it was\r\nto feel the wonted glow at Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s return coupled with a frightful\r\nsense of disgrace and depression.\r\n\r\nThe time was far on in October, and it was thus quite dark when the\r\ntravellers arrived, having walked from Charing Cross, where the coach set\r\nthem down.  My father came in first, and my mother clung to him as if he\r\nhad been absent for weeks, while all the joy of contact with my brother\r\nswept over me, even though his hand hung limp in mine, and was icy cold\r\nlike his cheeks.  My father turned to him with one of the little set\r\nspeeches of those days.  \xe2\x80\x98Here is our son, Mary, who has promised me to\r\ndo his utmost to retrieve his character, as far as may be possible, and\r\nhappily he is still young.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s embrace was in a sort of mechanical obedience to her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s gesture, and her voice was not perhaps meant to be so severe as\r\nit sounded when she said, \xe2\x80\x98You are very cold\xe2\x80\x94come and warm yourself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey made room for him by the fire, and my father stood up in front of\r\nit, giving particulars of the journey.  Emily and Martyn were at tea in\r\nthe nursery, in a certain awe that hindered them from coming down;\r\nindeed, Martyn seems to have expected to see some strange transformation\r\nin his brother.  Indeed, there was alteration in the absence of the blue\r\nand gold, and, still more, in the loss of the lightsome, hopeful\r\nexpression from the young face.\r\n\r\nThere is a picture of Ary Scheffer\xe2\x80\x99s of an old knight, whose son had fled\r\nfrom the battle, cutting the tablecloth in two between himself and the\r\nunhappy youth.  Like that stern baron\xe2\x80\x99s countenance was that with which\r\nmy mother sat at the head of the dinner-table, and we conversed by jerks\r\nabout whatever we least cared for, as if we could hide our wretchedness\r\nfrom Peter.  When the children appeared each gave Clarence the shyest of\r\nkisses, and they sat demurely on their chairs on either side of my father\r\nto eat their almonds and raisins, after which we went upstairs, and there\r\nwas the usual reading.  It is curious, but though none of us could have\r\ntold at the time what it was about, on turning over not long ago a copy\r\nof Head\xe2\x80\x99s _Pampas and Andes_, one chapter struck me with an intolerable\r\nsense of melancholy, such as the bull chases of South America did not\r\nseem adequate to produce, and by and by I remembered that it was the book\r\nin course of being read at that unhappy period.  My mother went on as\r\ndiligently as ever with some of those perpetual shirts which seemed to be\r\nalways in hand except before company, when she used to do tambour work\r\nfor Emily\xe2\x80\x99s frocks.  Clarence sat the whole time in a dark corner, never\r\nstirring, except that he now and then nodded a little.  He had gone\r\nthrough many wakeful, and worse than wakeful, nights of wretched\r\nsuspense, and now the worst was over.\r\n\r\nFamily prayers took place, chill good-nights were exchanged, and nobody\r\ninterfered with his helping me up to my bedroom as usual; but there was\r\nsomething in his face to which I durst not speak, though perhaps I\r\nlooked, for he exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t, Ned!\xe2\x80\x99 wrung my hand, and sped away to\r\nhis own quarters higher up.  Then came a sound which made me open my door\r\nto listen.  Dear little Emily!  She had burst out of her own room in her\r\ndressing-gown, and flung herself upon her brother as he was plodding\r\nwearily upstairs in the dark, clinging round his neck sobbing, \xe2\x80\x98Dear,\r\ndear Clarry!  I can\xe2\x80\x99t bear it!  I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.  You\xe2\x80\x99re my own dear\r\nbrother, and they are all wicked, horrid people.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was all I heard, except hushings on Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s part, as if the\r\nopening of my door and the thread of light from it warned him that there\r\nwas risk of interruption.  He seemed to be dragging her up to her own\r\nroom, and I was left with a pang at her being foremost in comforting him.\r\n\r\nMy father enacted that he should be treated as usual.  But how could that\r\nbe when papa himself did not know how changed were his own ways from his\r\nkindly paternal air of confidence?  All trust had been undermined, so\r\nthat Clarence could not cross the threshold without being required to\r\nstate his object, and, if he overstayed the time calculated, he was\r\ncross-examined, and his replies received with a sigh of doubt.\r\n\r\nHe hung about the house, not caring to do much, except taking me out in\r\nmy Bath chair or languidly reading the most exciting books he could\r\nget;\xe2\x80\x94but there was no great stock of sensation then, except the Byronic,\r\nand from time to time one of my parents would exclaim, \xe2\x80\x98Clarence, I\r\nwonder you can find nothing more profitable to occupy yourself with than\r\ntrash like that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe would lay down the book without a word, and take up Smith\xe2\x80\x99s _Wealth of\r\nNations_ or Smollett\xe2\x80\x99s _England_\xe2\x80\x94the profitable studies recommended, and\r\nspeedily become lost in a dejected reverie, with fixed eyes and drooping\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nA HELPING HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Though hawks can prey through storms and winds,\r\n    The poor bee in her hive must dwell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94HENRY VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\nIN imagination the piteous dejection of our family seems to have lasted\r\nfor ages, but on comparison of dates it is plain that the first\r\nlightening of the burthen came in about a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Frith and Castleford was coming to the front in the Chinese\r\ntrade.  The junior partner was an old companion of my father\xe2\x80\x99s boyhood;\r\nhis London abode was near at hand, and he was a kind of semi-godfather to\r\nboth Clarence and me, having stood proxy for our nominal sponsors.  He\r\nwas as good and open-hearted a man as ever lived, and had always been\r\nvery kind to us; but he was scarcely welcome when my father, finding that\r\nhe had come up alone to London to see about some repairs to his house,\r\nwhile his family were still in the country, asked him to dine and\r\nsleep\xe2\x80\x94our first guest since our misfortune.\r\n\r\nMy mother could hardly endure to receive any one, but she seemed glad to\r\nsee my father become animated and like himself while Roman Catholic\r\nEmancipation was vehemently discussed, and the ruin of England hotly\r\npredicted.  Clarence moped about silently as usual, and tried to avoid\r\nnotice, and it was not till the next morning\xe2\x80\x94after breakfast, when the\r\ntwo gentlemen were in the dining-room, nearly ready to go their several\r\nways, and I was in the window awaiting my classical tutor\xe2\x80\x94that Mr.\r\nCastleford said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98May I ask, Winslow, if you have any plans for that poor boy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward?\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, almost wilfully misunderstanding.  \xe2\x80\x98His\r\nambition is to be curator of something in the British Museum, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMr. Castleford explained that he meant the other, and my father sadly\r\nanswered that he hardly knew; he supposed the only thing was to send him\r\nto a private tutor, but where to find a fit one he did not know and\r\nbesides, what could be his aim?  Sir John Griffith had said he was only\r\nfit for the Church, \xe2\x80\x98But one does not wish to dispose of a tarnished\r\narticle there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Castleford; and then he spoke words that\r\nrejoiced my heart, though they only made my father groan, bidding him\r\nremember that it was not so much actual guilt as the accident of\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s being in the Navy that had given so serious a character to his\r\ndelinquencies.  If he had been at school, perhaps no one would ever have\r\nheard of them, \xe2\x80\x98Though I don\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x99 added the good man, casting a new\r\nlight on the subject, \xe2\x80\x98that it would have been better for him in the\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x99  Then, quite humbly, for he knew my mother especially had a disdain\r\nfor trade, he asked what my father would think of letting him give\r\nClarence work in the office for the present.  \xe2\x80\x98I know,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\nnot the line your family might prefer, but it is present occupation; and\r\nI do not think you could well send a youth who has seen so much of the\r\nworld back to schooling.  Besides, this would keep him under your own\r\neye.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy father was greatly touched by the kindness, but he thought it right to\r\nset before Mr. Castleford the very worst side of poor Clarence; declaring\r\nthat he durst not answer for a boy who had never, in spite of pains and\r\npunishments, learnt to speak truth at home or abroad, repeating Captain\r\nBrydone\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful report, and even adding that, what was most grievous\r\nof all, there was an affectation of piety about him that could scarcely\r\nbe anything but self-deceit and hypocrisy.  \xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98my eldest\r\nson, Griffith, is just a boy, makes no profession, is not\xe2\x80\x94as I am afraid\r\nyou have seen\xe2\x80\x94exemplary at church, when Clarence sits as meek as a mouse,\r\nbut then he is always above-board, frank and straightforward.  You know\r\nwhere to have a high-spirited fellow, who will tame down, but you never\r\nknow what will come next with the other.  I sometimes wonder for what\r\nerror of mine Providence has seen fit to give me such a son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJust then an important message came for Mr. Winslow, and he had to hurry\r\naway, but Mr. Castleford still remained, and presently said,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward, I should like to know what your eyes have been trying to say all\r\nthis time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 I burst out, \xe2\x80\x98do give him a chance.  Indeed he never means to\r\ndo wrong.  The harm is not in him.  He would have been the best of us all\r\nif he had only been let alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThose were exactly my own foolish words, for which I could have beaten\r\nmyself afterwards; but Mr. Castleford only gave a slight grave smile, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98You mean that your brother\xe2\x80\x99s real defect is in courage, moral and\r\nphysical.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, with a great effort at expressing myself.  \xe2\x80\x98When he is\r\nfrightened, or bullied, or browbeaten, he does not know what he is doing\r\nor saying.  He is quite different when he is his own self; only nobody\r\ncan understand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStrange that though the favoured home son and nearly sixteen years old,\r\nit would have been impossible to utter so much to one of our parents.\r\nIndeed the last sentence felt so disloyal that the colour burnt in my\r\ncheeks as the door opened; but it only admitted Clarence, who, having\r\nheard the front door shut, thought the coast was clear, and came in with\r\na load of my books and dictionaries.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clarence,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Castleford, and the direct address made him start\r\nand flush, \xe2\x80\x98supposing your father consents, should you be willing to turn\r\nyour mind to a desk in my counting-house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe flushed deeper red, and his fingers quivered as he held by the table.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, sir.  Anything\xe2\x80\x94anything,\xe2\x80\x99 he said hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Castleford, with the kindest of voices, \xe2\x80\x98let us have it\r\nout.  What is in your mind?  You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m a sort of godfather to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, if you would only let me have a berth on board one of your vessels,\r\nand go right away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aye, my poor boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you would like best, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no doubt; but\r\nlook at Edward\xe2\x80\x99s face there, and think what that would come to at the\r\nbest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know I have no right to choose,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, drooping his head\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis not that, my dear lad,\xe2\x80\x99 said the good man, \xe2\x80\x98but that packing you\r\noff like that, among your inferiors in breeding and everything else,\r\nwould put an end to all hope of your redeeming the past\xe2\x80\x94outwardly I mean,\r\nof course\xe2\x80\x94and lodge you in a position of inequality to your brothers and\r\nsister, and all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s done already,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you were a man grown it might be so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Castleford, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nbless me, how old are you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seventeen next 1st of November,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not a bit too old for a fresh beginning,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Castleford cheerily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98God helping you, you will be a brave and good man yet, my boy\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 then as\r\nmy master rang at the door\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Come with me and look at the old shop.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Clarence muttered something unintelligible, and I had to own for him\r\nthat he never went out without accounting for himself.  Whereupon our\r\nfriend caused my mother to be hunted up, and explained to her that he\r\nwanted to take Clarence out with him\xe2\x80\x94making some excuse about something\r\nthey were to see together.\r\n\r\nThat walk enabled him to say something which came nearer to cheering\r\nClarence than anything that had passed since that sad return, and made\r\nhim think that to be connected with Mr. Castleford was the best thing\r\nthat could befall him.  Mr. Castleford on his side told my father that he\r\nwas sure that the boy was good-hearted all the time, and thoroughly\r\nrepentant; but this had the less effect because plausibility, as my\r\nfather called it, was one of the qualities that specially annoyed him in\r\nClarence, and made him fear that his friend might be taken in.  However,\r\nthe matter was discussed between the elders, and it was determined that\r\nthis most friendly offer should be accepted experimentally.  It was\r\nimpressed on Clarence, with unnecessary care, that the line of life was\r\ninferior; but that it was his only chance of regaining anything like a\r\nposition, and that everything depended on his industry and integrity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Integrity!\xe2\x80\x99 commented Clarence, with a burning spot on his cheek after\r\none of these lectures; \xe2\x80\x98I believe they think me capable of robbing the\r\noffice!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe found out, too, that the senior partner, Mr. Frith, a very crusty old\r\nbachelor, did not like the appointment, and that it was made quite\r\nagainst his will.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting your clerks next from Newgate!\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\nwhat some amiable friend reported him to have said.  However, Mr.\r\nCastleford had his way, and Clarence was to begin his work with the New\r\nYear, being in the meantime cautioned and lectured on the crime and\r\ndanger of his evil propensities more than he could well bear.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ngroaned, \xe2\x80\x98it serves me right, I know that very well, but if my father\r\nonly knew how I hate and abhor all those things\xe2\x80\x94and how I loathed them at\r\nthe very time I was dragged into them!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell him so?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would make it no better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not so bad as if you had gone into it willingly, and for your own\r\npleasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He would only think that another lie.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo more could be said, for the idea of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s untruthfulness and\r\ndepravity had become so deeply rooted in our father\xe2\x80\x99s mind that there was\r\nlittle hope of displacing it, and even at the best his manner was full of\r\ngrave constrained pity.  Those few words were Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s first approach\r\nto confidence with me, but they led to more, and he knew there was one\r\nperson who did not believe the defect was in the bent of his will so much\r\nas in its strength.\r\n\r\nAll the time the prospect of the counting-house in comparison with the\r\nsea was so distasteful to him that I was anxious whenever he went out\r\nalone, or even with Griffith, who despised the notion of, as he said,\r\nsitting on a high stool, dealing in tea, so much that he was quite\r\ncapable of aiding and abetting in an escape from it.  Two considerations,\r\nhowever, held Clarence back; one, the timidity of nature which shrank\r\nfrom so violent a step, and the other, the strong affections that bound\r\nhim to his home, though his sojourn there was so painful.  He knew the\r\nmisery his flight would have been to me; indeed I took care to let him\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\nAnd Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s return was like a fresh spring wind dispersing vapours.\r\nHe had gained an excellent scholarship at Brazenose, and came home\r\nradiant with triumph, cheering us all up, and making a generous use of\r\nhis success.  He was no letter-writer, and after learning that the\r\ndisaster and disgrace were all too certain, he ignored the whole, and\r\nhailed Clarence on his return as if nothing had happened.  As eldest son,\r\nand almost a University man, he could argue with our parents in a manner\r\nwe never presumed on.  At least I cannot aver what he actually uttered,\r\nbut probably it was a revised version of what he thundered forth to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Such nonsense! such a shame to keep the poor beggar going about with\r\nthat hang dog look, as if he had done for himself for life!  Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nknown fellows do ever so much worse of their own accord, and nothing come\r\nof it.  If it was found out, there might be a row and a flogging, and\r\nthere was an end of it.  As to going about mourning, and keeping the\r\nwhole house in doleful dumps, as if there was never to be any good again,\r\nit was utter folly, and so I\xe2\x80\x99ve told Bill, and papa and mamma, both of\r\nthem!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHow this was administered, or how they took it, there is no knowing, but\r\nGriff would neither skate nor go to the theatre, nor to any other\r\ndiversion, without his brother; and used much kindly force and banter to\r\nunearth him from his dismal den in the back drawing-room.  He was only\r\nlet alone when there were engagements with friends, and indeed, when\r\nmeetings in the streets took place, by tacit agreement, Clarence would\r\nshrink off in the crowd as if not belonging to his companion; and these\r\nwere the moments that stung him into longing to flee to the river, and\r\nlose the sense of shame among common sailors: but there was always some\r\ngood angel to hold him back from desperate measures\xe2\x80\x94chiefly just then,\r\nthe love between us three brothers, a love that never cooled throughout\r\nour lives, and which dear old Griff made much more apparent at this\r\ncritical time than in the old Win and Slow days of school.  That return\r\nof his enlivened us all, and removed the terrible constraint from our\r\nmeals, bringing us back, as it were, to ordinary life and natural\r\nintercourse among ourselves and with our neighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98But when I lay upon the shore,\r\n       Like some poor wounded thing,\r\n    I deemed I should not evermore\r\n       Refit my wounded wing.\r\n    Nailed to the ground and fastened there,\r\n    This was the thought of my despair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                              ABP. TRENCH.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE\xe2\x80\x99S debut at the office was not wholly unsuccessful.  He wrote a\r\ngood hand, and had a good deal of method and regularity in his nature,\r\ntogether with a real sense of gratitude to Mr. Castleford; and this bore\r\nhim through the weariness of his new employment, and, what was worse, the\r\ncold reception he met with from the other clerks.  He was too quiet and\r\nreserved for the wilder spirits, too much of a gentleman for others, and\r\nin the eyes of the managers, and especially of the senior partner, a\r\ndisgraced, untrustworthy youth foisted on the office by Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweak partiality.  That old Mr. Frith had, Clarence used to say, a\r\nperfectly venomous way of accepting his salute, and seemed always\r\nsurprised and disappointed if he came in in time, or showed up correct\r\nwork.  Indeed, the old man was disliked and feared by all his\r\nsubordinates as much as his partner was loved; and while Mr. Castleford,\r\nwith his good-natured Irish wife and merry family, lived a life as\r\ncheerful as it was beneficent, Mr. Frith dwelt entirely alone, in rooms\r\nover the office, preserving the habits formed when his income had been\r\nnarrow, and mistrusting everybody.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first month of experiment, Mr. Castleford declared\r\nhimself contented with Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s industry and steadiness, and permanent\r\narrangements were made, to which Clarence submitted with an odd sort of\r\npassive gratitude, such as almost angered my father, who little knew how\r\ntrying the position really was, nor how a certain home-sickness for the\r\nseafaring life was tugging at the lad\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and making each morning\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentrance at the counting-house an effort\xe2\x80\x94each merchant-captain, redolent\r\nof the sea, an object of envy.  My mother would have sympathised here,\r\nbut Clarence feared her more than my father, and she was living in\r\ncontinual dread of some explosion, so that her dark curls began to show\r\nstreaks of gray, and her face to lose its round youthfulness.\r\n\r\nLent brought the question of Confirmation.  Under the influence of good\r\nBishop Blomfield, and in the wave of evangelical revival\xe2\x80\x94then at its\r\nflood height\xe2\x80\x94Confirmation was becoming a more prominent subject with\r\nreligious people than it had probably ever been in our Church, and it was\r\nrecognised that some preparation was desirable beyond the power of\r\nrepeating the Church Catechism.  This was all that had been required of\r\nmy father at Harrow.  My mother\xe2\x80\x99s godfather, a dignified clergyman, had\r\nsimply said, \xe2\x80\x98I suppose, my dear, you know all about it;\xe2\x80\x99 and as for the\r\nAdmiral, he remarked, \xe2\x80\x98Confirmed!  I never was confirmed anything but a\r\npost-captain!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOur incumbent was more attentive to his duties, or rather recognised more\r\nduties, than his predecessor.  He preached on the subject, and formed\r\nclasses, sixteen being then the limit of age,\xe2\x80\x94since the idea of the vow,\r\nhaving become far more prominent than that of the blessing, it was held\r\nthat full development of the will and understanding was needful.\r\n\r\nI was of the requisite age, and my father spoke to the clergyman, who\r\ncalled, and, as I could not attend the classes, gave me books to read and\r\nquestions to answer.  Clarence read and discussed the questions with me,\r\nshowing so much more insight into them, and fuller knowledge of Scripture\r\nthan I possessed, that I exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Why should you not go up for\r\nConfirmation too?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered mournfully.  \xe2\x80\x98I must take no more vows if I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep\r\nthem.  It would just be profane.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI had no more to say; indeed, my parents held the same view.  It was good\r\nMr. Castleford who saw things differently.  He was a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s son, and\r\nhad been bred up in the old orthodoxy, which was just beginning to put\r\nforth fresh shoots, and, as a quasi-godfather, he held himself bound to\r\ntake an interest in our religious life, while the sponsors, whose names\r\nstood in the family Bible, and whose spoons reposed in the plate-chest,\r\nnever troubled themselves on the matter.  I remember Clarence leaning\r\nover me and saying, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Castleford thinks I might be confirmed.  He says\r\nit is not so much the promise we make as of coming to Almighty God for\r\nstrength to keep what we are bound by already!  He is going to speak to\r\npapa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one except Mr. Castleford could have prevailed over the fear\r\nof profanation in the mind of my father, who was, in his old-fashioned\r\nway, one of the most reverent of men, and could not bear to think of holy\r\nthings being approached by one under a stigma, nor of exposing his son to\r\nadd to his guilt by taking and breaking further pledges.  However, he was\r\nstruck by his friend\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, and I heard him telling my mother that\r\nwhen he had wished to wait till there had been time to prove sincerity of\r\nrepentance by a course of steadiness, the answer had been that it was\r\nhard to require strength, while denying the means of grace.  My mother\r\nwas scarcely convinced, but as he had consented she yielded without a\r\nprotest; and she was really glad that I should have Clarence at my side\r\nto help me at the ceremony.  The clergyman was applied to, and consented\r\nto let Clarence attend the classes, where his knowledge, comprehension,\r\nand behaviour were exemplary, so that a letter was written to my father\r\nexpressive of perfect satisfaction with him.  \xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nknew it would be so!  It is not _that_ which I want.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe Confirmation seemed at the time a very short and perfunctory result\r\nof our preparation; and, as things were conducted or misconducted then,\r\ninvolved so much crowding and distress that I recollect very little but\r\nclinging to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s arm under a strong sense of my infirmities,\xe2\x80\x94the\r\npainful attempt at kneeling, and the big outstretched lawn sleeves while\r\nthe blessing was pronounced over six heads at once, and then the struggle\r\nback to the pew, while the silver-pokered apparitor looked grim at us, as\r\nthough the maimed and halt had no business to get into the way.  Yet this\r\nwas a great advance upon former Confirmations, and the Bishop met my\r\nfather afterwards, and inquired most kindly after his lame son.\r\n\r\nWe were disappointed, and felt that we could not attain to the feelings\r\nin the Confirmation poem in the _Christian Year_\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s gift to\r\nme.  Still, I believe that, though encumbered with such a drag as myself,\r\nClarence, more than I did,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Felt Him how strong, our hearts how frail,\r\n    And longed to own Him to the death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the evangelical belief that dejection ought to be followed by a full\r\nsense of pardon and assurance of salvation somewhat perplexed and dimmed\r\nour Easter Communion.  For one short moment, as Clarence turned to help\r\nmy father lift me up from the altar-rail, I saw his face and eyes radiant\r\nwith a wonderful rapt look; but it passed only too fast, and the more\r\nthan ordinary glimpse his spiritual nature had had made him all the more\r\nsad afterwards, when he said, \xe2\x80\x98I would give everything to know that there\r\nwas any steadfastness in my purpose to lead a new life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you are leading a new life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only because there is no one to bully me,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.  Still, there had\r\nbeen no reproach against him all the time he had been at Frith and\r\nCastleford\xe2\x80\x99s, when suddenly we had a great shock.\r\n\r\nParties were running very high, and there were scurrilous papers about,\r\nwhich my father perfectly abhorred; and one day at dinner, when\r\ndeclaiming against something he had seen, he laid down strict commands\r\nthat none should be brought into the house.  Then, glancing at Clarence,\r\nsomething possessed him to say, \xe2\x80\x98You have not been buying any.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 Clarence answered; but a few minutes later, when we were alone\r\ntogether, the others having left him to help me upstairs, he exclaimed,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward, what is to be done?  I didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it; but there is one of those\r\npapers in my great-coat pocket.  Pollard threw it on my desk; and there\r\nwas something in it that I thought would amuse you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There I am again!  I simply could not, with his eye on me!  Miserable\r\nbeing that I am!  Oh, where is the spirit of ghostly strength?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Helping you now to take it to papa in the study and explain!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried;\r\nbut the struggle in that tall fellow was as if he had been seven years\r\nold instead of seventeen, ere he put his hand over his face and gave me\r\nhis arm to come out into the hall, fetch the paper, and make his\r\nconfession.  Alas! we were too late.  The coat had been moved, the paper\r\nhad fallen out; and there stood my mother with it in her hand, looking at\r\nClarence with an awful stony face of mute grief and reproach, while he\r\nstammered forth what he had said before, and that he was about to give it\r\nto my father.  She turned away, bitterly, contemptuously indignant and\r\nincredulous; and my corroborations only served to give both her and my\r\nfather a certain dread of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s influence over me, as though I had\r\nbeen either deceived or induced to back him in deceiving them.  The\r\nunlucky incident plunged him back into the depths, just as he had begun\r\nto emerge.  Slight as it was, it was no trifle to him, in spite of\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x99s exclamation, \xe2\x80\x98How absurd!  Is a fellow to be bound to give an\r\naccount of everything he looks at as if he were six years old?  Catch me\r\nletting my mother pry into my pockets!  But you are too meek, Bill; you\r\nperfectly invite them to make a row about nothing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE INHERITANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98For he that needs five thousand pound to live\r\n    Is full as poor as he that needs but five.\r\n    But if thy son can make ten pound his measure,\r\n    Then all thou addest may be called his treasure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                           GEORGE HERBERT.\r\n\r\nIT was in the spring of 1829 that my father received a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nannouncing the death of James Winslow, Esquire, of Chantry House,\r\nEarlscombe, and inviting him, as heir-at-law, to be present at the\r\nfuneral and opening of the will.  The surprise to us all was great.  Even\r\nmy mother had hardly heard of Chantry House itself, far less as a\r\npossible inheritance; and she had only once seen James Winslow.  He was\r\nthe last of the elder branch of the family, a third cousin, and older\r\nthan my father, who had known him in times long past.  When they had last\r\nmet, the Squire of Chantry House was a married man, with more than one\r\nchild; my father a young barrister; and as one lived entirely in the\r\ncountry and the other in town, without any special congeniality, no\r\nintercourse had been kept up, and it was a surprise to hear that he had\r\nleft no surviving children.  My father greatly doubted whether being\r\nheir-at-law would prove to avail him anything, since it was likely that\r\nso distant a relation would have made a will in favour of some nearer\r\nconnection on his wife\xe2\x80\x99s or mother\xe2\x80\x99s side.  He was very vague about\r\nChantry House, only knowing that it was supposed to be a fair property,\r\nand he would hardly consent to take Griffith with him by the Western\r\nRoyal Mail, warning him and all the rest of us that our expectations\r\nwould be disappointed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless we looked out the gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s seats in _Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s Road\r\nBook_, and after much research, for Chantry House lay far off from the\r\nmain road, we came upon\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Chantry House, Earlscombe, the seat of James\r\nWinslow, Esquire, once a religious foundation; beautifully situated on a\r\nrising ground, commanding an extensive prospect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A religious foundation!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Emily.  \xe2\x80\x98It will be a dear delicious old\r\nabbey, all Gothic architecture, with cloisters and ruins and ghosts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ghosts!\xe2\x80\x99 said my mother severely, \xe2\x80\x98what has put such nonsense into your\r\nhead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNevertheless Emily made up her mind that Chantry House would be another\r\nMelrose, and went about repeating the moonlight scene in the _Lay of the\r\nLast Minstrel_ whenever she thought no one was there to laugh at her.\r\n\r\nMy father and Griffith returned with the good news that there was no\r\nmistake.  Chantry House was really his own, with the estate belonging to\r\nit, reckoned at \xc2\xa35000 a year, exclusive of a handsome provision to Miss\r\nSelby, the niece of the late Mrs. Winslow, a spinster of a certain age,\r\nwho had lived with her uncle, and now proposed to remove to Bath.  Mr.\r\nWinslow had, it appeared, lost his only son as a schoolboy, and his\r\ndaughters, like their mother, had been consumptive.  He had always been\r\nresolved that the estate should continue in the family; but reluctance to\r\nsee any one take his son\xe2\x80\x99s place had withheld him from making any\r\nadvances to my father; and for several years past he had been in broken\r\nhealth with failing faculties.\r\n\r\nOf course there was much elation.  Griff described as charming the place,\r\nperched on the southern slope of a wooded hill, with a broad fertile\r\nvalley lying spread out before it, and the woods behind affording every\r\npromise of sport.  The house, my father said, was good, odd and\r\nirregular, built at different times, but quite habitable, and with plenty\r\nof furniture, though he opined that mamma would think it needed\r\nmodernising, to which she replied that our present chattels would make a\r\ngreat difference; whereat my father, looking at the effects of more than\r\ntwenty years of London blacks, gave a little whistle, for she was always\r\nthe economical one of the pair.\r\n\r\nEmily, with glowing cheeks and eager eyes, entreated to know whether it\r\nwas Gothic, and had a cloister!  Papa nipped her hopes of a cloister, but\r\nthere were Gothic windows and doorway, and a bit of ruin in the garden, a\r\nfragment of the old chapel.\r\n\r\nMy father could not resign his office without notice, and, besides, he\r\nwished Miss Selby to have leisure for leaving her home of many years;\r\nafter which there would be a few needful repairs.  The delay was not a\r\ngreat grievance to any of us except little Martyn.  We were much more\r\nCockney than almost any one is in these days of railways.  We were\r\nunusually devoid of kindred on both sides, my father\xe2\x80\x99s holidays were\r\nshort, I was not a very movable commodity, and economy forbade long\r\njourneys, so that we had never gone farther than Ramsgate, where we\r\nclaimed a certain lodging-house as a sort of right every summer.\r\n\r\nReal country was as much unknown to us as the backwoods.  My father alone\r\nhad been born and bred to village life and habits, for my mother had\r\nspent her youth in a succession of seaport towns, frequented by\r\nmen-of-war.  We heard, too, that Chantry House was very secluded, with\r\nonly a few cottages near at hand\xe2\x80\x94a mile and a half from the church and\r\nvillage of Earlscombe, three from the tiny country town of Wattlesea,\r\nfour from the place where the coach passed, connecting it with the\r\ncivilisation of Bath and Bristol, from each of which places it was about\r\nhalf a day\xe2\x80\x99s distance, according to the measures of those times.  It was\r\na sort of banishment to people accustomed to the stream of life in\r\nLondon; and though the consequence and importance derived from being\r\nraised to the ranks of the Squirearchy were agreeable, they were a dear\r\npurchase at the cost of being out of reach of all our friends and\r\nacquaintances, as well as of other advantages.\r\n\r\nTo my father, however, the retirement from his many years of drudgery was\r\nreally welcome, and he had preserved enough of country tastes to rejoice\r\nthat it was, as he said, a clear duty to reside on his estate and look\r\nafter his property.  My mother saw his relief in the prospect, and\r\nsuppressed her sighs at the dislocation of her life-long habits, and the\r\nloss of intercourse with the acquaintance whom separation raised to the\r\nrank of intimate friends, even her misgivings as to butchers, bakers, and\r\ngrocers in the wilderness, and still worse, as to doctors for me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Humph!\xe2\x80\x99 said the Admiral, \xe2\x80\x98the boy will be all the better without them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd so I was; I can\xe2\x80\x99t say they were the subject of much regret, but I was\r\nreally sorry to leave our big neighbour, the British Museum, where there\r\nwere good friends who always made me welcome, and encouraged me in\r\nstudies of coins and heraldry, which were great resources to me, so that\r\nI used to spend hours there, and was by no means willing to resign my\r\nambition of obtaining an appointment there, when I heard my father say\r\nthat he was especially thankful for his good fortune because it enabled\r\nhim to provide for me.  There were lessons, too, from masters in\r\nlanguages, music, and drawing, which Emily and I shared, and which she\r\nhad just begun to value thoroughly.  We had filled whole drawing-books\r\nwith wriggling twists of foliage in B B B marking pencil, and had just\r\nbeen promoted to water-colours; and she was beginning to sing very\r\nprettily.  I feared, too, that I should no longer have a chance of\r\nrivalling Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s university studies.  All this, with my sister\xe2\x80\x99s girl\r\nfriends, and those kind people who used to drop in to play chess, and\r\notherwise amuse me, would all be left behind; and, sorest of all,\r\nClarence, who, whatever he was in the eyes of others, had grown to be my\r\nmainstay during this last year.  He it was who fetched me from the\r\nMuseum, took me into the gardens, helped me up and down stairs, spared no\r\npains to rout out whatever my fanciful pursuits required from shops in\r\nthe City, and, in very truth, spoilt me through all his hours that were\r\nfree from business, besides being my most perfect sympathising and\r\nunderstanding companion.\r\n\r\nI feared, too, that he would be terribly lonesome, though of late he had\r\nbeen less haunted by longings for the sea, had made some way with his\r\nfellows, and had been commended by the managing clerk; and it was painful\r\nto find the elders did not grieve on their own account at parting with\r\nhim.  My mother told the Admiral that she thought it would be good for\r\nMr. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s spirits not to be continually reminded of his trouble; and\r\nmy father might be heard confiding to Mr. Castleford that the separation\r\nmight be good for both her and her son, if only the lad could be trusted.\r\nTo which that good man replied by giving him an excellent character; but\r\nwas only met by a sigh, and \xe2\x80\x98Well, we shall see!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence was to be lodged with Peter, whose devotion would not extend to\r\nfollowing us into barbarism, where, as he told us, he understood there\r\nwas no such thing as a \xe2\x80\x98harea,\xe2\x80\x99 and master would have to kill his own\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\nPeter had been tranquilly engaged to Gooch for years untold.  They were\r\nto be transformed into Mr. and Mrs. Robson, with some small appointment\r\nabout the Law Courts for him, and a lodging-house for her, where Clarence\r\nwas to abide, my mother feeling secure that neither his health, his\r\nmorals, nor his shirts could go much astray without her receiving warning\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, by the help of an antiquarian friend of my father, Mr.\r\nStafford, who was great in county history, I hunted up in the Museum\r\nlibrary all I could discover about our new possession.\r\n\r\nThe Chantry of St. Cecily at Earlscombe, in Somersetshire, had, it\r\nappeared, been founded and endowed by Dame Isabel d\xe2\x80\x99Oyley, in the year of\r\ngrace 1434, that constant prayers might be offered for the souls of her\r\nhusband and son, slain in the French wars.  The poor lady\xe2\x80\x99s intentions,\r\nwhich to our Protestant minds appeared rather shocking than otherwise,\r\nhad been frustrated at the break up of such establishments, when the\r\nChantry, and the estate that maintained its clerks and bedesmen, was\r\ngranted to Sir Harry Power, from whom, through two heiresses, it had come\r\nto the Fordyces, the last of whom, by name Margaret, had died childless,\r\nleaving the estate to her stepson, Philip Winslow, our ancestor.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we learnt that a portion of the building was of ancient date,\r\nand that there was an \xe2\x80\x98interesting fragment\xe2\x80\x99 of the old chapel in the\r\ngrounds, which our good friend promised himself the pleasure of\r\ninvestigating on his first holiday.\r\n\r\nTo add to our newly-acquired sense of consideration and of high pedigree,\r\nthe family chariot, after taking Miss Selby to Bath, came up post to\r\nLondon to be touched up at the coachbuilder\xe2\x80\x99s, have the escutcheon\r\naltered so as to impale the Griffith coat instead of the Selby, and\r\nfinally to convey us to our new abode, in preparation for which all its\r\nboxes came to be packed.\r\n\r\nA chariot!  You young ones have as little notion of one as of a British\r\nwar-chariot armed with scythes.  Yet people of a certain grade were as\r\nsure to keep their chariot as their silver tea-pot; indeed we knew one\r\nyoung couple who started in life with no other habitation, but spent\r\ntheir time as nomads, in visits to their relations and friends, for\r\nvisits _were_ visits then.\r\n\r\nThe capacities of a chariot were considerable.  Within, there was a\r\ngood-sized seat for the principal occupants, and outside a dickey behind,\r\nand a driving box before, though sometimes there was only one of these,\r\nand that transferable.  The boxes were calculated to hold family luggage\r\non a six months\xe2\x80\x99 tour.  There they lay on the spare-room floor, ready to\r\nbe packed, the first earnest of our new possessions\xe2\x80\x94except perhaps the\r\nfive-pound note my father gave each of us four elder ones, on the day the\r\nbalance at the bank was made over to him.  There was the imperial, a\r\ngrand roomy receptacle, which was placed on the top of the carriage, and\r\nwould not always go upstairs in small houses; the capbox, which fitted\r\ninto a curved place in front of the windows, and could not stand alone,\r\nbut had a frame to support it; two long narrow boxes with the like\r\ninfirmity of standing, which fitted in below; square ones under each\r\nseat; and a drop box fastened on behind.  There were pockets beneath each\r\nwindow, and, curious relic in name and nature of the time when every\r\ngentleman carried his weapon, there was the sword case, an excrescence\r\nbehind the back of the best seat, accessible by lifting a cushion, where\r\nweapons used to be carried, but where in our peaceful times travellers\r\nbestowed their luncheon and their books.\r\n\r\nOur chariot was black above, canary yellow below, beautifully varnished,\r\nand with our arms blazoned on each door.  It was lined with dark blue\r\nleather and cloth, picked out with blue and yellow lace in accordance\r\nwith our liveries, and was a gorgeous spectacle.  I am afraid Emily did\r\nnot share in Mistress Gilpin\xe2\x80\x99s humility when\r\n\r\n          \xe2\x80\x98The chaise was brought,\r\n       But yet was not allowed\r\n    To drive up to the door, lest all\r\n       Should say that she was proud!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was then that Emily and I each started a diary to record the events of\r\nour new life.  Hers flourished by fits and starts; but I having perforce\r\nmore leisure than she, mine has gone on with few interruptions till the\r\npresent time, and is the backbone of this narrative, which I compile and\r\ncondense from it and other sources before destroying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE OLD HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Your history whither are you spinning?\r\n       Can you do nothing but describe?\r\n    A house there is, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                     GRAY.\r\n\r\nHow we did enjoy our journey, when the wrench from our old home was once\r\nmade.  We did not even leave Clarence behind, for Mr. Castleford had\r\ngiven him a holiday, so that he might not appear to be kept at a\r\ndistance, as if under a cloud, and might help me through our travels.\r\n\r\nMy mother and I occupied the inside of the carriage, with Emily between\r\nus at the outset; but when we were off the London stones she was often\r\nallowed to make a third on the dickey with Clarence and Martyn, whose\r\necstatic heels could be endured for the sake of the free air and the\r\nview.  Of course we posted, and where there were severe hills we indulged\r\nin four horses.  The varieties of the jackets of our post-boys, blue or\r\nyellow, as supposed to indicate the politics of their inns, were\r\ninteresting to us, as everything was interesting then.  Otherwise their\r\nequipment was exactly alike\xe2\x80\x94neat drab corduroy breeches and top-boots,\r\nand hats usually white, and they were all boys, though the red faces and\r\ngrizzled hair of some looked as if they had faced the weather for at\r\nleast fifty years.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful August, and the harvest fields were a sight perfectly\r\nnew, filling us with rapture unspeakable.  At every hill which offered an\r\nexcuse, our outsiders were on their feet, thrusting in their heads and\r\nhands to us within with exclamations of delight, and all sorts of\r\ndiscoveries\xe2\x80\x94really new to us three younger ones.  Ears of corn, bearded\r\nbarley, graceful oats, poppies, corn-flowers, were all delicious\r\nnovelties to Emily and me, though Griff and my father laughed at our\r\necstasies, and my mother occasionally objected to the wonderful\r\naccumulation of curiosities thrust into her lap or the door pockets, and\r\ntried to persuade Martyn that rooks\xe2\x80\x99 wings, dead hedgehogs, sticks and\r\nstones of various merits, might be found at Earlscombe, until Clarence,\r\nby the judicious purchase of a basket at Salisbury, contrived to satisfy\r\nall parties and safely dispose of the treasures.  The objects that stand\r\nout in my memory on that journey were Salisbury Spire, and a long hill\r\nwhere the hedgebank was one mass of the exquisite rose-bay willow herb\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nperfect revelation to our city-bred eyes; but indeed, the whole route was\r\nlike one panorama to us of _L\xe2\x80\x99Allegro_ and other descriptions on which we\r\nhad fed.  For in those days we were much more devoted to poetry than is\r\nthe present generation, which has a good deal of false shame on that\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nEven dining and sleeping at an inn formed a pleasing novelty, though we\r\ndid not exactly sympathise with Martyn when he dashed in at breakfast\r\nexulting in having witnessed the killing of a pig.  As my father\r\nobserved, it was too like realising Peter\xe2\x80\x99s forebodings of our return to\r\nsavage life.\r\n\r\nDemonstrations were not the fashion of these times, and there was a good\r\ndeal of dull discontent and disaffection in the air, so that no tokens of\r\nwelcome were prepared for us\xe2\x80\x94not even a peal of bells; nor indeed should\r\nwe have heard them if they had been rung, for the church was a mile and a\r\nhalf beyond the house, with a wood between cutting off the sound, except\r\nin certain winds.  We did not miss a reception, which would rather have\r\nembarrassed us.  We began to think it was time to arrive, and my father\r\nbelieved we were climbing the last hill, when, just as we had passed a\r\nremarkably pretty village and church, Griffith called out to say that we\r\nwere on our own ground.  He had made his researches with the game keeper\r\nwhile my father was busy with the solicitor, and could point to our\r\nboundary wall, a little below the top of the hill on the northern side.\r\nHe informed us that the place we had passed was Hillside\xe2\x80\x94Fordyce\r\nproperty,\xe2\x80\x94but this was Earlscombe, our own.  It was a great stony bit of\r\npasture with a few scattered trees, but after the flat summit was past,\r\nthe southern side was all beechwood, where a gate admitted us into a\r\ndrive cut out in a slant down the otherwise steep descent, and coming out\r\ninto an open space.  And there we were!\r\n\r\nThe old house was placed on the widest part of a kind of shelf or natural\r\nterrace, of a sort of amphitheatre shape, with wood on either hand, but\r\nleaving an interval clear in the midst broad enough for house and\r\ngardens, with a gentle green slope behind, and a much steeper one in\r\nfront, closed in by the beechwoods.  The house stood as it were sideways,\r\nor had been made to do so by later inhabitants.  I know this is very\r\nlong-winded, but there have been such alterations that without minute\r\ndescription this narrative will be unintelligible.\r\n\r\nThe aspect was northwards so far as the lie of the ground was concerned,\r\nbut the house stood across.  The main body was of the big symmetrical\r\nLouis XIV. style\xe2\x80\x94or, as it is now the fashion to call it, Queen\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x94brick, with stone quoins, big sash-windows, and a great square hall\r\nin the midst, with the chief rooms opening into it.  The principal\r\nentrance had been on the north, with a huge front door and a flight of\r\nstone steps, and just space enough for a gravel coach ring before the\r\nrapid grassy descent.  Later constitutions, however, must have eschewed\r\nthat northern front door, and later nerves that narrow verge, and on the\r\neastern front had been added that Gothic porch of which Emily had\r\nheard,\xe2\x80\x94and a flagrantly modern Gothic porch it was, flanked by two\r\ncomical little turrets, with loopholes, from which a thread-paper or Tom\r\nThumb might have defended it.  Otherwise it resembled a church porch,\r\nexcept for the formidable points of a sham portcullis; but there was no\r\ndenying that it greatly increased the comfort of the house, with its two\r\nsets of heavy doors, and the seats on either side.  The great hall door\r\nhad been closed up, plastered over within, and rendered inoffensive.\r\nTowards the west there was another modern addition of drawing and dining\r\nrooms, and handsome bedchambers above, in Gothic taste, _i.e._ with\r\npointed arches filled up with glass over the sash-windows.  The\r\ndrawing-room was very pretty, with a glass door at the end leading into\r\nan old-fashioned greenhouse, and two French windows to the south opening\r\nupon the lawn, which soon began to slope upwards, curving, as I said,\r\nlike an amphitheatre, and was always shady and sheltered, tilting its\r\nflower-beds towards the house as if to display them.  The dining-room\r\nhad, in like manner, one west and two north windows, the latter\r\ncommanding a grand view over the green meadow-land below, dotted with\r\nround knolls, and rising into blue hills beyond.  We became proud of\r\ncounting the villages and church towers we could see from thence.\r\n\r\nThere was a still older portion, more ancient than the square _corps de\r\nlogis_, and built of the cream-coloured stone of the country.  It was at\r\nthe south-eastern angle, where the ground began sloping so near the house\r\nthat this wing\xe2\x80\x94if it may so be called\xe2\x80\x94containing two good-sized rooms\r\nnearly on a level with the upper floor, had nothing below but some open\r\nstone vaultings, under which it was only just possible for my tall\r\nbrothers to stand upright, at the innermost end.  These opened into the\r\ncellars which, no doubt, belonged to the fifteenth-century structure.\r\nThere seemed to have once been a door and two or three steps to the\r\nground, which rose very close to the southern end; but this had been\r\nwalled up.  The rooms had deep mullioned windows east and west, and very\r\nhandsome groined ceilings, and were entered by two steps down from the\r\ngallery round the upper part of the hall.  There was a very handsome\r\ndouble staircase of polished oak, shaped like a Y, the stem of which\r\nbegan just opposite the original front door\xe2\x80\x94making us wonder if people\r\nknew what draughts were in the days of Queen Anne, and remember Madame de\r\nMaintenon\xe2\x80\x99s complaint that health was sacrificed to symmetry.  Not far\r\nfrom this oldest portion were some broken bits of wall and stumps of\r\ncolumns, remnants of the chapel, and prettily wreathed with ivy and\r\nclematis.  We rejoiced in such a pretty and distinctive ornament to our\r\ngarden, and never troubled ourselves about the desecration; and certainly\r\nours was one of the most delightful gardens that ever existed, what with\r\ngreen turf, bright flowers, shapely shrubs, and the grand beech-trees\r\nenclosing it with their stately white pillars, green foliage, and the\r\nrusset arcades beneath them.  The stillness was wonderful to ears\r\naccustomed to the London roar\xe2\x80\x94almost a new sensation.  Emily was found,\r\nas she said, \xe2\x80\x98listening to the silence;\xe2\x80\x99 and my father declared that no\r\none could guess at the sense of rest that it gave him.\r\n\r\n                       [Picture: Map of the house]\r\n\r\nOf space within there was plenty, though so much had been sacrificed to\r\nthe hall and staircase; and this was apparently the cause of the modern\r\nadditions, as the original sitting-rooms, wainscotted and double-doored,\r\nwere rather small for family requirements.  One of these, once the\r\ndining-room, became my father\xe2\x80\x99s study, where he read and wrote, saw his\r\ntenants, and by and by acted as Justice of the Peace.  The opposite one,\r\ntowards the garden, was termed the book-room.  Here Martyn was to do his\r\nlessons, and Emily and I carry on our studies, and do what she called\r\nkeeping up her accomplishments.  My couch and appurtenances abode there,\r\nand it was to be my retreat from company,\xe2\x80\x94or on occasion could be made a\r\nsupplementary drawing-room, as its fittings showed it had been the\r\nparlour.  It communicated with another chamber, which became my\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94sparing the difficulties that stairs always presented; and beyond\r\nlay, niched under the grand staircase, a tiny light closet, a\r\npassage-room, where my mother put a bed for a man-servant, not liking to\r\nleave me entirely alone on the ground floor.  It led to a passage to the\r\ngarden door, also to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s den, dedicated to housewifely cares and\r\nstores, and ended at the back stairs, descending to the servants\xe2\x80\x99 region.\r\nThis was very old, handsomely vaulted with stone, and, owing to the fall\r\nof the ground, had ample space for light on the north side,\xe2\x80\x94where, beyond\r\nthe drive, the descent was so rapid as to afford Martyn infinite delight\r\nin rolling down, to the horror of all beholders and the detriment of his\r\nwhite duck trowsers.\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about the upper story, so I spare you that.  Emily had\r\na hankering for one of the pretty old mullioned-windowed rooms\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nmullion chambers, as she named them; but Griff pounced on them at once,\r\nthe inner for his repose, the outer for his guns and his studies\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nsmoking, for young men were never permitted to smoke within doors, nor\r\nindeed in any home society.  The choice of the son and heir was\r\nundisputed, and he proceeded to settle his possessions in his new\r\ndomains, where they made an imposing appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nRATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98As louder and louder, drawing near,\r\n    The gnawing of their teeth he could hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                  SOUTHEY.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98WHAT a ridiculous old fellow that Chapman is,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff, coming in\r\nfrom a conference with the gaunt old man who acted as keeper to our not\r\nvery extensive preserves.  \xe2\x80\x98I told him to get some gins for the rats in\r\nmy rooms, and he shook his absurd head like any mandarin, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere baint no trap as will rid you of them kind of varmint, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course,\xe2\x80\x99 my father said, \xe2\x80\x98rats are part of the entail of an old\r\nhouse.  You may reckon on them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Those rooms of yours are the very place for them,\xe2\x80\x99 added my mother.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nonly hope they will not infest the rest of the house.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which Griff rejoined that they perpetrated the most extraordinary\r\nnoises he had ever heard from rats, and told Emily she might be thankful\r\nto him for taking those rooms, for she would have been frightened out of\r\nher little wits.  He meant, he said, to get a little terrier, and have a\r\nthorough good rat hunt, at which Martyn capered about in irrepressible\r\necstasy.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was deferred by the unwillingness of old Chapman, of whom\r\neven Griff was somewhat in awe.  His fame as a sportsman had to be made,\r\nand he had had only such practice as could be attained by shooting at a\r\nmark ever since he had been aware of his coming greatness.  So he was\r\ndesirous of conciliating Chapman, and not getting laughed at as the\r\nLondon young gentleman who could not hit a hay-stack.  My father, who had\r\nbeen used to carrying a gun in his younger days, was much amused, in his\r\nquiet way, at seeing Griff watch Chapman off on his rounds, and then\r\nbetake himself to the locality most remote from the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s ears to\r\npractise on the rook or crow.  Martyn always ran after him, having\r\nsolemnly promised not to touch the gun, and to keep behind.  He was too\r\ngood-natured to send the little fellow back, though he often tried to\r\nelude the pursuit, not wishing for a witness to his attempts; and he\r\nnever invited Clarence, who had had some experience of curious game but\r\nnever mentioned it.\r\n\r\nClarence devoted himself to Emily and me, tugging my garden-chair along\r\nall the paths where it would go without too much jolting, and when I had\r\nhad enough, exploring those hanging woods, either with her or on his own\r\naccount.  They used to come home with their hands full of flowers, and\r\nthis resulted in a vehement attack of botany,\xe2\x80\x94a taste that has lasted all\r\nour lives, together with the _hortus siccus_ to which we still make\r\nadditions, though there has been a revolution there as well as everywhere\r\nelse, and the Linn\xc3\xa6an system we learnt so eagerly from Martin\xe2\x80\x99s _Letters_\r\nis altogether exploded and antiquated.  Still, my sister refuses to own\r\nthe scientific merits of the natural system, and can point to school-bred\r\nand lectured young ladies who have no notion how to discover the name or\r\nnature of a live plant.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday after our arrival the noises had been so fearful that Griff\r\nhad been exasperated into going off across the hills, accompanied by his\r\nconstant shadow, Martyn, in search of the professional ratcatcher of the\r\nneighbourhood, in spite of Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s warning\xe2\x80\x94that Tom Petty was the\r\nbiggest rascal in the neighbourhood, and a regular out and out poacher;\r\nand as to the noises\xe2\x80\x94he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98tackle the like of they.\xe2\x80\x99  After\r\nrevelling in the beauty of the beechwoods as long as was good for me or\r\nfor Clarence, I was left in the garden to sketch the ruin, while my two\r\ncompanions started on one of their exploring expeditions.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late enough to think of going to prepare for the six\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner when Emily came forth alone from the path between the\r\ntrees, announcing\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98An adventure, Edward!  We have had such an adventure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s Clarence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Gone for the doctor!  Oh, no; Griff hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shot anybody.  He is gone for\r\nthe ratcatcher, you know.  It is a poor little herdboy, who tumbled out\r\nof a tree; and oh! such a sweet, beautiful, young lady\xe2\x80\x94just like a book!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Emily became less incoherent, it appeared that on coming out on the\r\nbit of common above the wood, as she and Clarence were halting on the\r\nbrow of the hill to admire the view, they heard a call for help, and\r\nhurrying down in the direction whence it proceeded they saw a stunted\r\nash-tree, beneath which were a young lady and a little child bending over\r\na village lad who lay beneath moaning piteously.  The girl, whom Emily\r\ndescribed as the most beautiful creature she ever saw, explained that the\r\nboy, who had been herding the cattle scattered around, had been climbing\r\nthe tree, a limb of which had broken with him.  She had seen the fall\r\nfrom a distance, and hurried up; but she hardly knew what to do, for her\r\nlittle sister was too young to be sent in quest of assistance.  Clarence\r\nthought one leg seriously injured, and as the young lady seemed to know\r\nthe boy, offered to carry him home.  School officers were yet in the\r\nfuture; children were set to work almost as soon as they could walk, and\r\nthis little fellow was so light and thin as to shock Clarence when he had\r\nbeen taken up on his back, for he weighed quite a trifle.  The young lady\r\nshowed the way to a wretched little cottage, where a bigger girl had just\r\ncome in with a sheaf of corn freshly gleaned poised on her head.  They\r\nsent her to fetch her mother, and Clarence undertook to go for a doctor,\r\nbut to the surprise and horror of Emily, there was a demur.  Something\r\nwas said of old Molly and her \xe2\x80\x98ile\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98yarbs,\xe2\x80\x99 or perhaps Madam could\r\nstep round.  When Clarence, on this being translated to him, pronounced\r\nthe case beyond such treatment, it was explained outside the door that\r\nthis was a terribly poor family, and the doctor would not come to parish\r\npatients for an indefinite time after his summons, besides which, he\r\nlived at Wattlesea.  \xe2\x80\x98Indeed mamma does almost all the doctoring with her\r\nmedicine chest,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl.\r\n\r\nOn which Clarence declared that he would let the doctor know that he\r\nhimself would be responsible for the cost of the attendance, and set off\r\nfor Wattlesea, a kind of town village in the flat below.  He could not\r\nget back till dinner was half over, and came in alarmed and apologetic;\r\nbut he had nothing worse to encounter than Griff\xe2\x80\x99s unmerciful banter (or,\r\nas you would call it, chaff) about his knight errantry, and Emily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlovely heroine in the sweetest of cottage bonnets.\r\n\r\nGriff could be slightly tyrannous in his merry mockery, and when he found\r\nthat on the ensuing day Clarence proposed to go and inquire after the\r\npatient, he made such wicked fun of the expectations the pair entertained\r\nof hearing the sweet cottage bonnet reading a tract in a silvery voice\r\nthrough the hovel window, that he fairly teased and shamed Clarence out\r\nof starting till the renowned Tom Petty arrived and absorbed all the\r\nthree brothers, and even their father, in delights as mysterious to me as\r\nto Emily.  How she shrieked when Martyn rushed triumphantly into the room\r\nwhere we were arranging books with the huge patriarch of all the rats\r\ndangling by his tail!  Three hopeful families were destroyed; rooms,\r\nvaults, and cellars examined and cleared; and Petty declared the race to\r\nbe exterminated, picturesque ruffian that he was, in his shapeless hat,\r\nrusty velveteen, long leggings, a live ferret in his pocket, and festoons\r\nof dead rats over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nChapman, who regarded him much as the ferret did the rat, declared that\r\nthe rabbits and hares would suffer from letting \xe2\x80\x98that there chap\xe2\x80\x99 show\r\nhis face here on any plea; and, moreover, gave a grunt very like a scoff;\r\nat the idea of slumbers in the mullion rooms (as they were called) being\r\nsecured by his good offices.\r\n\r\nAnd Chapman was right.  The unaccountable noises broke out\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94screaming, wailing, sobbing\xe2\x80\x94sounds scarcely within the power of cat\r\nor rat, but possibly the effect of the wind in the old building.  At any\r\nrate, Griff could not stand them, and declared that sleep was impossible\r\nwhen the wind was in that quarter, so that he must shift his bedroom\r\nelsewhere, though he still wished to retain the outer apartment, which he\r\nhad taken pleasure in adorning with his special possessions.  My mother\r\nwould scarcely have tolerated such fancies in any one else, but Griff had\r\nhis privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nOUR TUNEFUL CHOIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98The church has been whitewashed, but right long ago,\r\n    As the cracks and the dinginess amply doth show;\r\n    About the same time that a strange petrifaction\r\n    Confined the incumbent to mere Sunday action.\r\n    So many abuses in this place are rife,\r\n    The only church things giving token of life\r\n    Are the singing within and the nettles without\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Both equally rampant without any doubt.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                           F. R. HAVERGAL.\r\n\r\nALL Griff\xe2\x80\x99s teasing could not diminish\xe2\x80\x94nay, rather increased\xe2\x80\x94Emily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexcitement in the hope of seeing and identifying the sweet cottage bonnet\r\nat church on Sunday.  The distance we had to go was nearly two miles, and\r\nmy mother and I drove thither in a donkey chair, which had been hunted up\r\nin London for that purpose because the \xe2\x80\x98phee\xc4\x81ton\xe2\x80\x99 (as the servants\r\ninsisted on calling it) was too high for me.  My father had an\r\nold-fashioned feeling about the Fourth Commandment, which made him\r\nscrupulous as to using any animal on Sunday; and even when, in bad\r\nweather, or for visitors, the larger carriage was used, he always walked.\r\nHe was really angry with Griff that morning for mischievously maintaining\r\nthat it was a greater breach of the commandment to work an ass than a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty drive on a road slanting gradually through the brushwood\r\nthat clothed the steep face of the hillside, and passing farms and\r\nmeadows full of cattle\xe2\x80\x94all things quieter and stiller than ever in their\r\nSunday repose.  We knew that the living was in Winslow patronage, but\r\nthat it was in the hands of one of the Selby connection, who held it,\r\ntogether with it is not safe to say how many benefices, and found it\r\nnecessary for his health to reside at Bath.  The vicarage had long since\r\nbeen turned into a farmhouse, and the curate lived at Wattlesea.  All\r\nthis we knew, but we had not realised that he was likewise assistant\r\ncurate there, and only favoured Earlscombe with alternate morning and\r\nevening services on Sundays.\r\n\r\nStill less were we prepared for the interior of the church.  It had a\r\npicturesque square tower covered with ivy, and a general air of fitness\r\nfor a sketch; indeed, the photograph of it in its present beautified\r\nstate will not stand a comparison with our drawings of it, in those days\r\nof dilapidation in the middle of the untidy churchyard, with little boys\r\nastride on the sloping, sunken lichen-grown headstones, mullein spikes\r\nand burdock leaves, more graceful than the trim borders and zinc crosses\r\nwhich are pleasanter to the mental eye.\r\n\r\nThe London church we had left would be a fearful shock to the present\r\ngeneration, but we were accustomed to decency, order, and reverence; and\r\nit was no wonder that my father was walking about the churchyard,\r\nmuttering that he never saw such a place, while my brothers were full of\r\namusement.  Their spruce looks in their tall hats, bright ties, dark\r\ncoats, and white trowsers strapped tight under their boots, looked\r\nincongruous with the rest of the congregation, the most distinguished\r\nmembers of which were farmers in drab coats with huge mother-of-pearl\r\nbuttons, and long gaiters buttoned up to their knees and strapped up to\r\ntheir gay waistcoats over their white corduroys.  Their wives and\r\ndaughters were in enormous bonnets, fluttering with ribbons; but then\r\nwhat my mother and Emily wore were no trifles.  The rest of the\r\ncongregation were\xe2\x80\x94the male part of it\xe2\x80\x94in white or gray smock-frocks, the\r\nelderly women in black bonnets, the younger in straw; but we had not long\r\nto make our observations, for Chapman took possession of us.  He was\r\nparish clerk, and was in great glory in his mourning coat and hat, and\r\nhis object was to marshal us all into our pew before he had to attend\r\nupon the clergyman; and of course I was glad enough to get as soon as\r\npossible out of sight of all the eyes not yet accustomed to my figure.\r\n\r\nAnd hidden enough I was when we had been introduced through the little\r\nnorth chancel door into a black-curtained, black-cushioned, black-lined\r\npew, well carpeted, with a table in the midst, and a stove, whose pipe\r\nmade its exit through the floriated tracery of the window overhead.  The\r\nchancel arch was to the west of us, blocked up by a wooden parcel-gilt\r\nerection, and to the east a decorated window that would have been very\r\nhandsome if two side-lights had not been obscured by the two Tables of\r\nthe Law, with the royal arms on the top of the first table, and over the\r\nother our own, with the Fordyce in a scutcheon of pretence; for, as an\r\ninscription recorded, they had been erected by Margaret, daughter of\r\nChristopher Fordyce, Esquire, of Chantry House, and relict of Sir James\r\nJohn Winslow, Kt., sergeant-at-law, A.D. 1700\xe2\x80\x94the last date, I verily\r\nbelieve, at which anything had been done to the church.  And on the wall,\r\nstopping up the southern chancel window, was a huge marble slab,\r\nsupported by angels blowing trumpets, with a very long inscription about\r\nthe Fordyce family, ending with this same Margaret, who had married the\r\nWinslow, lost two or three infants, and died on 1st January 1708, three\r\nyears later than her husband.\r\n\r\nThus far I could see; but Griff was standing lifting the curtain, and\r\nshowing by the working of his shoulders his amazement and diversion, so\r\nthat only the daggers in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes kept Martyn from springing up\r\nafter him.  What he beheld was an altar draped in black like a coffin,\r\nand on the step up to the rail, boys and girls eating apples and\r\nperforming antics to beguile the waiting time, while a row of\r\nwhite-smocked old men occupied the bench opposite to our seat, conversing\r\nloud enough for us to hear them.\r\n\r\nMy father and Clarence came in; the bells stopped; there was a sound of\r\nsteps, and in the fabric in front of us there emerged a grizzled head and\r\nthe back of a very dirty surplice besprinkled with iron moulds, while\r\nChapman\xe2\x80\x99s back appeared above our curtain, his desk (full of dilapidated\r\nprayer-books) being wedged in between us and the reading-desk.\r\n\r\nThe duet that then took place between him and the curate must have been\r\nheard to be credible, especially as, being so close behind the old man,\r\nwe could not fail to be aware of all the remarkable shots at long words\r\nwhich he bawled out at the top of his voice, and I refrain from\r\nrecording, lest they should haunt others as they have done by me all my\r\nlife.  Now and then Chapman caught up a long switch and dashed out at\r\nsome obstreperous child to give an audible whack; and towards the close\r\nof the litany he stumped out\xe2\x80\x94we heard his tramp the whole length of the\r\nchurch, and by and by his voice issued from an unknown height,\r\nproclaiming\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Let us sing to the praise and glory \xe2\x80\x94 in an anthem taken\r\nfrom the 42d chapter of Genesis.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was an outburst of bassoon, clarionet, and fiddle, and the\r\nperformance that followed was the most marvellous we had ever heard,\r\nespecially when the big butcher\xe2\x80\x94fiddling all the time\xe2\x80\x94declared in a\r\nmighty solo, \xe2\x80\x98I am Jo\xe2\x80\x94Jo\xe2\x80\x94Jo\xe2\x80\x94Joseph!\xe2\x80\x99 and having reiterated this\r\ninformation four or five times, inquired with equal pertinacity,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Doth\xe2\x80\x94doth my fa-a-u-ther yet live?\xe2\x80\x99  Poor Emily was fairly \xe2\x80\x98convulsed;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth, and grew so crimson that my\r\nmother was quite frightened, and very near putting her out at the little\r\ndoor of excommunication.  To our last hour we shall never forget the\r\nshock of that first anthem.\r\n\r\nThe Commandments were read from the desk, Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s solitary response\r\ncoming from the gallery; and while the second singing\xe2\x80\x94four verses from\r\nTate and Brady\xe2\x80\x94was going on, we beheld the surplice stripped off,\xe2\x80\x94like\r\nthe slough of a May-fly, as Griff said,\xe2\x80\x94when a rusty black gown was\r\nrevealed, in which the curate ascended the pulpit and was lost to our\r\nview before the concluding verse of the psalm, which we had reason to\r\nbelieve was selected in compliment to us, as well as to Earlscombe,\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98My lot is fall\xe2\x80\x99n in that blest land\r\n       Where God is truly know,\r\n    He fills my cup with liberal hand;\r\n       \xe2\x80\x99Tis He\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis He\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99tis He\xe2\x80\x94supports my throne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe had great reason to doubt how far the second line could justly be\r\napplied to the parish! but there was no judging of the sermon, for only\r\ndetached sentences reached us in a sort of mumble.  Griff afterwards\r\ndeclared churchgoing to be as good as a comedy, and we all had to learn\r\nto avoid meeting each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, whatever we might hear.  When the\r\nscuffle and tramp of the departing congregation had ceased, we came forth\r\nfrom our sable box, and beheld the remnants of a once handsome church,\r\nmauled in every possible way, green stains on the walls, windows bricked\r\nup, and a huge singing gallery.  Good bits of carved stall work were\r\nnailed anyhow into the pews; the floor was uneven; no font was visible;\r\nthere was a mouldy uncared-for look about everything.  The curate in\r\nriding-boots came out of the vestry,\xe2\x80\x94a pale, weary-looking man, painfully\r\nmeek and civil, with gray hair sleeked round his face.  He \xe2\x80\x98louted low,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand seemed hardly to venture on taking the hand my father held out to\r\nhim.  There was some attempt to enter into conversation with him, but he\r\nbegged to be excused, for he had to hurry back to Wattlesea to a funeral.\r\nPoor man! he was as great a pluralist as his vicar, for he kept a boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nschool, partially day, partially boarding, and his eyes looked hungrily\r\nat Martyn.\r\n\r\nIf the \xe2\x80\x98sweet cottage bonnet\xe2\x80\x99 had been at church there would have been\r\nlittle chance of discovering her, but we found that we were the only\r\n\xe2\x80\x98quality,\xe2\x80\x99 as Chapman called it, or things might not have been so bad.\r\nOld James Winslow had been a mere fox-hunting squire till he became a\r\nvaletudinarian; nor had he ever cared for the church or for the poor, so\r\nthat the village was in a frightful state of neglect.  There was a\r\ndissenting chapel, old enough to be overgrown with ivy and not too\r\nhideous, erected by the Nonconformists in the reign of the Great\r\nDeliverer, but this partook of the general decadence of the parish, and,\r\nas we found, the chapel\xe2\x80\x99s principal use was to serve as an excuse for not\r\ngoing to church.\r\n\r\nMy father always went to church twice, so he and Clarence walked to\r\nWattlesea, where appearances were more respectable; but they heard the\r\nsame sermon over again, and, as my father drily remarked, it was not a\r\ncomposition that would bear repetition.\r\n\r\nHe was much distressed at the state of things, and intended to write to\r\nthe incumbent, though, as he said, whatever was done would end by being\r\nat his own expense, and the move and other calls left him so little in\r\nhand that he sighed over the difficulties, and declared that he was\r\nbetter off in London, except for the honour of the thing.  Perhaps my\r\nmother was of the same opinion after a dreary afternoon, when Griff and\r\nMartyn had been wandering about aimlessly, and were at length betrayed by\r\nthe barking of a little terrier, purchased the day before from Tom Petty,\r\nbesieging the stable cat, who stood with swollen tail, glaring eyes, and\r\nthunderous growls, on the top of the tallest pillar of the ruins.  Emily\r\nnearly cried at their cruelty.  Martyn was called off by my mother, and\r\nset down, half sulky, half ashamed, to _Henry and his Bearer_; and Griff,\r\nvowing that he believed it was that brute who made the row at night, and\r\nthat she ought to be exterminated, strolled off to converse with Chapman,\r\nwho was a quaint compound of clerk and keeper\xe2\x80\x94in the one capacity\r\nupholding his late master, in the other bemoaning Mr. Mears\xe2\x80\x99\r\nunpunctualities, specially as regarded weddings and funerals; one \xe2\x80\x98corp\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhaving been kept waiting till a messenger had been sent to Wattlesea, who\r\nfinding both clergy out for the day, had had to go to Hillside, \xe2\x80\x98where\r\nthey was always ready, though the old Squire would have been mad with him\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99d a-guessed one of they Fordys had ever set foot in the parish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe only school in the place was close to the meeting-house, \xe2\x80\x98a very\r\ndame\xe2\x80\x99s school indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 as Emily described it after a peep on Monday.\r\nDame Dearlove, the old woman who presided, was a picture of Shenstone\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nschoolmistress,\xe2\x80\x94black bonnet, horn spectacles, fearful birch rod,\r\nthree-cornered buff \xe2\x80\x99kerchief, checked apron and all, but on meddling\r\nwith her, she proved a very dragon, the antipodes of her name.  Tattered\r\ncopies of the _Universal Spelling-Book_ served her aristocracy, ragged\r\nTestaments the general herd, whence all appeared to be shouting aloud at\r\nonce.  She looked sour as verjuice when my mother and Emily entered, and\r\ngave them to understand that \xe2\x80\x98she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to no strangers in her\r\nschool, and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x99em.\xe2\x80\x99  We found that in Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion she\r\n\xe2\x80\x98didn\xe2\x80\x99t larn \xe2\x80\x99em nothing.\xe2\x80\x99  She had succeeded her aunt, who had taught\r\nhim to read \xe2\x80\x98right off,\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x98her baint to be compared with she.\xe2\x80\x99  And\r\nnow the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 children, and the little aristocracy, including his own\r\ngrand-children,\xe2\x80\x94all indeed who, in his phrase, \xe2\x80\x98cared for\r\neddication,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94went to Wattlesea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98THEY FORDYS.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Of honourable reckoning are you both,\r\n    And pity \xe2\x80\x99tis, you lived at odds so long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                              SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nMY father had a good deal of business in hand, and was glad of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhelp in writing and accounts,\xe2\x80\x94a great pleasure, though it prevented his\r\nbeing Griff\xe2\x80\x99s companion in his exploring and essays at shooting.  He had\r\ntime, however, to make an expedition with me in the donkey chair to\r\ninquire after the herdboy, Amos Bell, and carry him some kitchen physic.\r\nTo our horror we found him quite alone in the wretched cottage, while\r\neverybody was out harvesting; but he did not seem to pity himself, or\r\nthink it otherwise than quite natural, as he lay on a little bed in the\r\ncorner, disabled by what Clarence thought a dislocation.  Miss Ellen had\r\nbrought him a pudding, and little Miss Anne a picture-book.\r\n\r\nHe was not so dense and shy as the children of the hamlet near us, and\r\nEmily extracted from him that Miss Ellen was \xe2\x80\x98Our passon\xe2\x80\x99s young lady.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mr. Mears\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No: ourn be Passon Fordy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt turned out that this place was not in Earlscombe at all, but in\r\nHillside, a different parish; and the boy, Amos, further communicated\r\nthat there was old Passon Fordy, and Passon Frank, and Madam, what was\r\nMr. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s lady.  Yes, he could read, he could; he went to Sunday\r\nSchool, and was in Miss Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s class; he had been to school worky days,\r\nonly father was dead, and Farmer Hartop gave him a job.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that Hillside was under a very different rule from\r\nEarlscombe; and Emily was delighted to have discovered that the sweet\r\ncottage bonnet\xe2\x80\x99s owner was called Ellen, which just then was the pet\r\nChristian name of romance, in honour of the _Lady of the Lake_.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her raptures, however, just as we were about to turn in\r\nat our own gate into the wood, we heard horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs, and then came,\r\ncareering by on ponies, a very pretty girl and a youth of about the same\r\nage.  Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s hand rose to his hat, and he made his eager bow; but the\r\nyoung lady did not vouchsafe the slightest acknowledgment, turned her\r\nhead away, and urged her pony to speed.\r\n\r\nEmily broke out with an angry disappointed exclamation.  Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nwas scarlet, and he said low and hoarsely, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s Lester.  He was in the\r\n_Argus_ at Portsmouth two years ago;\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and then, as our little sister\r\ncontinued her indignant exclamations, he added, \xe2\x80\x98Hush!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t on any\r\naccount say a word about it.  I had better get back to my work.  I am\r\nonly doing you harm by staying here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt which Emily shed tears, and together we persuaded him not to curtail\r\nhis holiday, which, indeed, he could not have done without assigning the\r\nreason to the elders, and this was out of the question.  Nor did he\r\nventure to hang back when, as our service was to be on Sunday afternoon,\r\nmy father proposed to walk to Hillside Church in the morning.  They came\r\nback well pleased.  There was care and decency throughout.  The psalms\r\nwere sung to a \xe2\x80\x98grinder organ\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94which was an advanced state of things in\r\nthose days\xe2\x80\x94and very nicely.  Parson Frank read well and impressively, and\r\nthe old parson, a fine venerable man, had preached an excellent\r\nsermon\xe2\x80\x94really admirable, as my father repeated.  Our party had been\r\nscarcely in time, and had been disposed of in seats close to the door,\r\nwhere Clarence was quite out of sight of the disdainful young lady and\r\nher squire, of whom Emily begged to hear no more.\r\n\r\nShe looked askance at the cards left on the hall table the next day\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98The\r\nRev. Christopher Fordyce,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98The Rev. F. C. Fordyce,\xe2\x80\x99 also \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. F. C.\r\nFordyce, Hillside Rectory.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe had found out that Hillside was a family living, and that there was\r\nmuch activity there on the part of the father and son\xe2\x80\x94rector and curate;\r\nand that the other clerical folk, ladies especially, who called on us,\r\nspoke of Mrs. F. C. Fordyce with a certain tone, as if they were afraid\r\nof her, as Sir Horace Lester\xe2\x80\x99s sister,\xe2\x80\x94very superior, very active, very\r\nstrict in her notions,\xe2\x80\x94as if these were so many defects.  They were an\r\noffshoot of the old Fordyces of Chantry House, but so far back that all\r\nrecollection of kindred or connection must have worn out.  Their\r\nproperty\xe2\x80\x94all in beautiful order\xe2\x80\x94marched with ours, and Chapman was very\r\nparticular about the boundaries.  \xe2\x80\x98Old master he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a bird\r\npicked up if it fell over on they Fordys\xe2\x80\x99 ground\xe2\x80\x94not he!  He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nabide passons, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the old Squire\xe2\x80\x94not Miss Hannah More, and all they\r\nCheddar lot, and they Fordys least of all.  My son\xe2\x80\x99s wife, she was for\r\nsending her little maid to Hillside to Madam Fordys\xe2\x80\x99 school, but, bless\r\nyour heart, \xe2\x80\x99twould have been as much as my place was worth if master had\r\nknown it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe visit was not returned till after Clarence had gone back to his\r\nLondon work.  Sore as was the loss of him from my daily life, I could see\r\nthat the new world and fresh acquaintances were a trial to him, and\r\nespecially since the encounter with young Lester had driven him back into\r\nhis shell, so that he would be better where he was already known and had\r\nnothing new to overcome.  Emily, though not yet sixteen, was emancipated\r\nfrom schoolroom habits, and the dear girl was my devoted slave to an\r\nextent that perhaps I abused.\r\n\r\nNot being \xe2\x80\x98come out,\xe2\x80\x99 she was left at home on the day when we set out on\r\na regular progress in the chariot with post-horses.  The britshka and\r\npair, which were our ambition, were to wait till my father\xe2\x80\x99s next rents\r\ncame in.  Morning calls in the country were a solemn and imposing\r\nceremony, and the head of the family had to be taken on the first\r\ncircuit; nor was there much scruple as to making them in the forenoon, so\r\nseveral were to be disposed of before fulfilling an engagement to\r\nluncheon at the farthest point, where some old London friends had\r\nborrowed a house for the summer, and had included me in their invitation.\r\n\r\nHere alone did I leave the carriage, but I had Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s _Spy_ and my\r\nsketch-book as companions while waiting at doors where the inhabitants\r\nwere at home.  The last visit was at Hillside Rectory, a house of\r\narchitecture somewhat similar to our own, but of the soft creamy stone\r\nwhich so well set off the vine with purple clusters, the myrtles and\r\nfuchsias, that covered it.  I was wishing we had drawn up far enough off\r\nfor a sketch to be possible, when, from a window close above, I heard the\r\nfollowing words in a clear girlish voice\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, indeed!  I\xe2\x80\x99m not going down.  It is only those horrid Earlscombe\r\npeople.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t think how they have the face to come near us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a reply, perhaps that the parents had made the first visit, for\r\nthe rejoinder was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Yes; grandpapa said it was a Christian duty to make an\r\nadvance; but they need not have come so soon.  Indeed, I wonder they show\r\nthemselves at all.  I am sure I would not if I had such a dreadful son.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nPresently, \xe2\x80\x98I hate to think of it.  That I should have thanked him.\r\nDepend upon it, he will never pay the doctor.  A coward like that is\r\ncapable of anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe proverb had been realised, but there could hardly have been a more\r\ninvoluntary or helpless listener.  Presently my parents came back,\r\nescorted by both the gentlemen of the house, tall fine-looking men, the\r\nelder with snowy hair, and the dignity of men of the old school; the\r\nyounger with a joyous, hearty, out-of-door countenance, more like a\r\nsquire than a clergyman.\r\n\r\nThe visit seemed to have been gratifying.  Mrs. Fordyce was declared to\r\nbe of higher stamp than most of the neighbouring ladies; and my father\r\nwas much pleased with the two clergymen, while as we drove along he kept\r\non admiring the well-ordered fields and fences, and contrasting the\r\npretty cottages and trim gardens with the dreary appearance of our own\r\nvillage.  I asked why Amos Bell\xe2\x80\x99s home had been neglected, and was\r\nanswered with some annoyance, as I pointed down the lane, that it was on\r\nour land, though in Hillside parish.  \xe2\x80\x98I am glad to have such\r\nneighbours!\xe2\x80\x99 observed my mother, and I kept to myself the remarks I had\r\nheard, though I was still tingling with the sting of them.\r\n\r\nWe heard no more of \xe2\x80\x98they Fordys\xe2\x80\x99 for some time.  The married pair went\r\naway to stay with friends, and we only once met the old gentleman, when I\r\nwas waiting in the street at Wattlesea in the donkey chair, while my\r\nmother was trying to match netting silk in the odd little shop that\r\nunited fancy work, toys, and tracts with the post office.  Old Mr.\r\nFordyce met us as we drew up, handed her out with a grand seigneur\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourtesy, and stood talking to me so delightfully that I quite forgot it\r\nwas from Christian duty.\r\n\r\nMy father corresponded with the old Rector about the state of the parish,\r\nand at last went over to Bath for a personal conference, but without much\r\nsatisfaction.  The Earlscombe people were pronounced to be an ungrateful\r\ngood-for-nothing set, for whom it was of no use to do anything; and\r\nindeed my mother made such discoveries in the cottages that she durst not\r\nlet Emily fulfil her cherished scheme of visiting them.  The only\r\nresemblance to the favourite heroines of religious tales that could be\r\npermitted was assembling a tiny Sunday class in Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s lodge; and it\r\nmust be confessed that her brothers thought she made as much fuss about\r\nit as if there had been a hundred scholars.\r\n\r\nHowever, between remonstrances and offers of undertaking a share of the\r\nexpense, my father managed to get Mr. Mears\xe2\x80\x99 services dispensed with from\r\nthe ensuing Lady Day, and that a resident curate should be appointed, the\r\nchoice of whom was to rest with himself.  It was then and there decided\r\nthat Martyn should be \xe2\x80\x98brought up to the Church,\xe2\x80\x99 as people then used to\r\nterm destination to Holy Orders.  My father said he should feel justified\r\nin building a good house when he could afford it, if it was to be a\r\nprovision for one of his sons, and he also felt that as he had the charge\r\nof the parish as patron, it was right and fitting to train one of his\r\nsons up to take care of it.  Nor did Martyn show any distaste to the\r\nidea, as indeed there was less in it then than at present to daunt the\r\nimagination of an honest, lively boy, not as yet specially thoughtful or\r\ndevout, but obedient, truthful, and fairly reverent, and ready to grow as\r\nhe was trained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nMRS. SOPHIA\xe2\x80\x99S FEUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99er all there hung the shadow of a fear,\r\n       A sense of mystery the spirit daunted,\r\n    And said as plain as whisper in the ear,\r\n       The place is haunted.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94HOOD.\r\n\r\nWE had a houseful at Christmas.  The Rev. Charles Henderson, a Fellow of\r\nTrinity College, Oxford, lately ordained a deacon, had been recommended\r\nto us by our London vicar, and was willing not only to take charge of the\r\nparish, but to direct my studies, and to prepare Martyn for school.  He\r\ncame to us for the Christmas vacation to reconnoitre and engage lodgings\r\nat a farmhouse.  We liked him very much\xe2\x80\x94my mother being all the better\r\nsatisfied after he had shown her a miniature, and confided to her that\r\nthe original was waiting till a college living should come to him in the\r\ndistant future.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Griffith could not tear himself from his warm rooms and his club,\r\nbut our antiquarian friend, Mr. Stafford, came with his wife, and\r\nrevelled in the ceilings of the mullion room, where he would much have\r\nliked to sleep, but that its accommodations were only fit for a bachelor.\r\n\r\nOur other visitor was Miss Selby, or rather Mrs. Sophia Selby, as she\r\ndesignated herself, according to the becoming fashion of elderly\r\nspinsters, which to my mind might be gracefully resumed.  It irked my\r\nfather to think of the good lady\xe2\x80\x99s solitary Christmas at Bath, and he\r\nasked her to come to us.  She travelled half-way in a post-chaise, and\r\nthen was met by the carriage.  A very nice old lady she was, with a meek,\r\ndelicate babyish face, which could not be spoilt by the cap of the\r\nperiod, one of the most disfiguring articles of head gear ever devised,\r\nthough nobody thought so then.  She was full of kindness; indeed, if she\r\nhad a fault it was the abundant pity she lavished on me, and her\r\ndetermination to amuse me.  The weather was of the kind that only the\r\nhealthy and hardy could encounter, and when every one else was gone out,\r\nand I was just settling in with a new book, or an old crabbed Latin\r\ndocument, that Mr. Stafford had entrusted to me to copy out fairly and\r\ntranslate, she would glide in with her worsted work on a charitable\r\nmission to enliven poor Mr. Edward.\r\n\r\nHowever, this was the means of my obtaining some curious enlightenments.\r\nA dinner-party was in contemplation, and she was dismayed at the choice\r\nof the fashionable London hour of seven, and still more by finding that\r\nthe Fordyces were to be among the guests.  She was too well-bred to\r\nmanifest her feelings to her hosts, but alone with me, she could not\r\nrefrain from expressing her astonishment to me, all the more when she\r\nheard this was reciprocity for an invitation that it had not been\r\npossible to accept.  Her poor dear uncle would never hear of intercourse\r\nwith Hillside.  On being asked why, she repeated what Chapman had said,\r\nthat he could not endure any one connected with Mrs. Hannah More and her\r\ncanting, humbugging set, as the ungodly old man had chosen to call them,\r\nimbuing even this good woman with evil prejudices against their noble\r\nwork at Cheddar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Besides this, Fordyces and Winslows could never be friends, since the\r\nFordyces had taken on themselves to dispute the will, and say it had been\r\nimproperly obtained.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mrs. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94Margaret Fordyce that was.  She was the heiress, and had\r\nevery right to dispose of her property.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But that was more than a hundred years ago!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So it was, my dear; but though the law gave it to us\xe2\x80\x94to my uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngrandfather (or great-grandfather, was it?)\xe2\x80\x94those Fordyces never could\r\nrest content.  Why, one of them\xe2\x80\x94a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s son too\xe2\x80\x94shot young Philip\r\nWinslow dead in a duel.  They have always grudged at us.  Does your papa\r\nknow it, my dear Mr. Edward?  He ought to be aware.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not know,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98but he would hardly care about what happened in\r\nthe time of Queen Anne.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was curious to see how the gentle little lady espoused the family\r\nquarrel, which, after all, was none of hers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, you are London people, and the other branch, and may not feel as\r\nwe do down here; but I shall always say that Madam Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s husband\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson had every right to come before her cousin once removed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI asked if we were descended from her, for, having a turn for heraldry\r\nand genealogy, I wanted to make out our family tree.  Mrs. Sophia was\r\nready to hold up her hands at the ignorance of the \xe2\x80\x98other branch.\xe2\x80\x99  This\r\npoor heiress had lost all her children in their infancy, and bequeathed\r\nthe estate to her stepson, the Fordyce male heir having been endowed by\r\nher father with the advowson of Hillside and a handsome estate there,\r\nwhich Mrs. Selby thought ought to have contented him, \xe2\x80\x98but some people\r\nnever know when they have enough;\xe2\x80\x99 and, on my observing that it might\r\nhave been a matter of justice, she waxed hotter, declaring that what the\r\nWinslows felt so much was the accusation of violence against the poor\r\nlady.  She spoke as if it were a story of yesterday, and added, \xe2\x80\x98Indeed,\r\nthey made the common people have all sorts of superstitious fancies about\r\nthe room where she died\xe2\x80\x94that old part of the house.\xe2\x80\x99  Then she added in a\r\nlow mysterious voice, \xe2\x80\x98I hear that your brother Mr. Griffith Winslow\r\ncould not sleep there;\xe2\x80\x99 and when the rats and the wind were\r\nmentioned\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Yes, that was what my poor dear uncle used to say.  He always\r\ncalled it nonsense; but we never had a servant who would sleep there.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll not mention it, Mr. Edward, but I could not help asking that very\r\nnice housemaid, Jane, whether the room was used, and she said how Mr.\r\nGriffith had given it up, and none of the servants could spend a night\r\nthere when they are sleeping round.  Of course I said all in my power to\r\ndispel the idea, and told her that there was no accounting for all the\r\nnoises in old houses; but you never can reason with that class of\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ever hear the noises, Mrs. Selby?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no; I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep there for thousands!  Not that I attach any\r\nimportance to such folly,\xe2\x80\x94my poor dear uncle would never hear of such a\r\nthing; but I am such a nervous creature, I should lie awake all night\r\nexpecting the rats to run over me.  I never knew of any one sleeping\r\nthere, except in the gay times when I was a child, and the house used to\r\nbe as full as, or fuller than, it could hold, for the hunt breakfast or a\r\nball, and my poor aunt used to make up ever so many beds in the two\r\nrooms, and then we never heard of any disturbance, except what they made\r\nthemselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis chiefly concerned me, because home cosseting had made me old woman\r\nenough to be uneasy about unaired beds; and I knew that my mother meant\r\nto consign Clarence to the mullion chamber.  So, without betraying Jane,\r\nI spoke to her, and was answered, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of that; I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlight a fire and air the mattresses well.  I wish that was all, poor\r\nyoung gentleman!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo the reply that the rats were slaughtered and the wind stopped out,\r\nJane returned a look of compassion; but the subject was dropped, as it\r\nwas supposed to be the right thing to hush up, instead of fostering, any\r\npopular superstition; but it surprised me that, as all our servants were\r\nfresh importations, they should so soon have become imbued with these\r\nundefined alarms.\r\n\r\nMy father was much amused at being successor to this family feud, and\r\nsaid that when he had time he would look up the documents.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sophia was a sight when Mr. Fordyce and his son and daughter-in-law\r\nwere announced; she was so comically stiff between her deference to her\r\nhosts and her allegiance to her poor dear uncle; but her coldness melted\r\nbefore the charms of old Mr. Fordyce, who was one of the most delightful\r\npeople in the world.  She even was his partner at whist, and won the\r\ngame, and that she _did_ like.\r\n\r\nParson Frank, as we naughty young ones called him, was all good-nature\r\nand geniality\xe2\x80\x94a thorough clergyman after the ideas of the time, and a\r\nthorough farmer too; and in each capacity, as well as in politics, he\r\nsuited my father or Mr. Henderson.  His lady, in a blonde cap, exactly\r\nlike the last equipment my mother had provided herself with in London,\r\nand a black satin dress, had much more style than the more gaily-dressed\r\ncountry dames, and far more conversation.  Mr. Stafford, who had dreaded\r\nthe party, pronounced her a sensible, agreeable woman, and she was\r\nparticularly kind and pleasant to me, coming and talking over the botany\r\nof the country, and then speaking of my brother\xe2\x80\x99s kindness to poor Amos\r\nBell, who was nearly recovered, but was a weakly child, for whom she\r\ndreaded the toil of a ploughboy in thick clay with heavy shoes.\r\n\r\nI was sorry when, after Emily\xe2\x80\x99s well-studied performance on the piano,\r\nMrs. Fordyce was summoned away from me to sing, but her music and her\r\nvoice were both of a very different order from ordinary drawing-room\r\nmusic; and when our evening was over, we congratulated ourselves upon our\r\nneighbours, and agreed that the Fordyces were the gems of the party.\r\n\r\nOnly Mrs. Sophia sighed at us as degenerate Winslows, and Emily reserved\r\nto herself the right of believing that the daughter was \xe2\x80\x98a horrid girl.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nA SCRAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Though bound with weakness\xe2\x80\x99 heavy chain\r\n    We in the dust of earth remain;\r\n    Not all remorseful be our tears,\r\n    No agony of shame or fears,\r\n    Need pierce its passion\xe2\x80\x99s bitter tide.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                     _Verses and Sonnets_.\r\n\r\nPERHAPS it was of set purpose that our dinner-party had been given before\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s return.  Griffith had been expected in time for it, but he had\r\npreferred going by way of London to attend a ball given by the daughter\r\nof a barrister friend of my father\xe2\x80\x99s.  Selina Clarkson was a fine showy\r\ngirl, with the sort of beauty to inspire boyish admiration, and Griff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad been a standing family joke, even my father condescending to tease\r\nhim when the young lady married Sir Henry Peacock, a fat vulgar old man\r\nwho had made his fortune in the commissariat, and purchased a baronetcy.\r\nHe was allowing his young wife her full swing of fashion and enjoyment.\r\nMy mother did not think it a desirable acquaintance, and was restless\r\nuntil both the brothers came home together, long after dark on Christmas\r\nEve, having been met by the gig at the corner where the coach stopped.\r\nThe dinner-hour had been put off till half-past six, and we had to wait\r\nfor them, the coach having been delayed by setting down Christmas guests\r\nand Christmas fare.  They were a contrast; Griffith looking very handsome\r\nand manly, all in a ruddy glow from the frosty air, and Clarence, though\r\nequally tall, well-made, and with more refined features, looked pale and\r\neffaced, now that his sailor tan was worn off.  The one talked as eagerly\r\nas he ate, the other was shy, spiritless, and with little appetite; but\r\nas he always shrank into himself among strangers, it was the less wonder\r\nthat he sat in his drooping way behind my sofa, while Griffith kept us\r\nall merry with his account of the humours of the \xe2\x80\x98Peacock at home;\xe2\x80\x99 the\r\nlumbering efforts of old Sir Henry to be as young and gay as his wife, in\r\nspite of gout and portliness; and the extreme delight of his lady in her\r\nnew splendours\xe2\x80\x94a gold spotted muslin and white plumes in a diamond\r\nagraffe.  He mimicked Sir Henry\xe2\x80\x99s cockneyisms more than my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchivalry approved towards his recent host, as he described the complaints\r\nhe had heard against \xe2\x80\x98my Lady being refused the hentry at Halmack\xe2\x80\x99s, but\r\ntreated like the wery canal;\xe2\x80\x99 and how the devoted husband \xe2\x80\x98wowed he would\r\nget up a still more hexclusive circle, and shut hout these himpertinent\r\nfashionables who regarded Halmack\xe2\x80\x99s as the seventh \xe2\x80\x99eaven.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy mother shook her head at his audacious fun about Paradise and the\r\nPeri, but he was so brilliant and good-humoured that no one was ever long\r\ndispleased with him.  At night he followed when Clarence helped me to my\r\nroom, and carefully shutting the door, Griff began.  \xe2\x80\x98Now, Teddy, you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nalways as rich as a Jew, and I told Bill you\xe2\x80\x99d help him to set it\r\nstraight.  I\xe2\x80\x99d do it myself, but that I\xe2\x80\x99m cleaned out.  I\xe2\x80\x99d give ten\r\ntimes the cash rather than see him with that hang-dog look again for just\r\nnothing at all, if he would only believe so and be rational.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence did look indescribably miserable while it was explained that he\r\nhad been commissioned to receive about \xc2\xa320 which was owing to my father,\r\nand to discharge therewith some small debts to London tradesmen.  All\r\nexcept the last, for a little more than four pounds, had been paid, when\r\nClarence met in the street an old messmate, a good-natured rattle-pated\r\nyouth,\xe2\x80\x94one of those who had thought him harshly treated.  There was a\r\ncordial greeting, and an invitation to dine at once at a hotel, where\r\nthey were joined by some other young men, and by and by betook themselves\r\nto cards, when my poor brother\xe2\x80\x99s besetting enemy prevented him from\r\nwithdrawing when he found the points were guineas.  Thus he lost the\r\nremaining amount in his charge, and so much of his own that barely enough\r\nwas left for his journey.  His salary was not due till Lady Day; Mr.\r\nCastleford was in the country, and no advances could be asked from Mr.\r\nFrith.  Thus Griff had found him in utter despair, and had ever since\r\nbeen trying to cheer him and make light of his trouble.  If I advanced\r\nthe amount, which was no serious matter to me, Clarence could easily get\r\nPeter to pay the bill, and if my father should demand the receipt too\r\nsoon, it would be easy to put him off by saying there had been a delay in\r\ngetting the account sent in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, I should not have thought you would have stuck at that,\xe2\x80\x99 returned\r\nGriff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There must be no untruth,\xe2\x80\x99 I broke in; \xe2\x80\x98but if without _that_, he can\r\navoid getting into a scrape with papa\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence interrupted in the wavering voice we knew so well, but growing\r\nclearer and stronger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, Edward, but\xe2\x80\x94but\xe2\x80\x94no, I can\xe2\x80\x99t.  There\xe2\x80\x99s the Sacrament\r\nto-morrow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh\xe2\x80\x94h!\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff, in an indescribable tone.  But he will never believe\r\nyou, nor let you go.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Better so,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, half choked, \xe2\x80\x98than go profanely\xe2\x80\x94deceiving\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nnot knowing whether I shall\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJust then we heard our father wishing the other gentlemen good-night, and\r\nto our surprise Clarence opened the door, though he was deadly white and\r\nwith dew starting on his forehead.\r\n\r\nMy father turned good-naturedly.  \xe2\x80\x98Boys, boys, you are glad to be\r\ntogether, but mamma won\xe2\x80\x99t have you talking here all night, keeping her\r\nbaby up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, holding by the rail of the bed, \xe2\x80\x98I was waiting for\r\nyou.  I have something to tell you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words that followed were incoherent and wrong end foremost; nor had\r\nmany, indeed, been uttered before my father cut them short with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No false excuses, sir; I know you too well to listen.  Go.  I have\r\nceased to hope for anything better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence went without a word, but Griff and I burst out with entreaties\r\nto be listened to.  Our father thought at first that ours were only the\r\npleadings of partiality, and endeavours to shield the brother we both so\r\nheartily loved; but when he understood the circumstances, the real amount\r\nof the transgression, and Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of our united advice and\r\nassistance to conceal it, he was greatly touched and softened.  \xe2\x80\x98Poor\r\nlad! poor fellow!\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered, \xe2\x80\x98he is really doing his best.  I need not\r\nhave cut him so short.  I was afraid of more falsehoods if I let him open\r\nhis mouth.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and see.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe went off, and we remained in suspense, Griff observing that he had\r\ndone his best, but poor Bill always would be a fool, and that no one who\r\nhad not always lived at home like me would have let out that we had been\r\nfor the suppression policy.  As I was rather shocked, he went off to bed,\r\nsaying he should look in to see what remained of Clarence after the\r\npelting of the pitiless storm he was sure to bring on himself by his\r\nridiculous faltering instead of speaking out like a man.\r\n\r\nI longed to have been able to do the same, but my father kindly came back\r\nto relieve my mind by telling me that he was better satisfied about\r\nClarence than ever he had been before.  When encouraged to speak out, the\r\nnarrative of the temptation had so entirely agreed with what we had said\r\nas to show there had been no prevarication, and this had done more to\r\nconvince my father that he was on the right track than the having found\r\nhim on his knees.  He had had a patient hearing, and thus was able to\r\ncommand his nerves enough to explain himself, and it had ended in my\r\nfather giving entire forgiveness for what, as Griff truly said, would\r\nhave been a mere trifle but for the past.  The voluntary confession had\r\nmuch impressed my father, and he could not help adding a word of gentle\r\nreproof to me for having joined in aiding him to withhold it, but he\r\naccepted my explanation and went away, observing, \xe2\x80\x98By the by, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwonder at what Griffith says of that room; I never heard such strange\r\neffects of currents of air.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence was in my room before I was drest, full of our father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98wonderful goodness\xe2\x80\x99 to him.  He had never experienced anything like it,\r\nhe said.  \xe2\x80\x98Why! he really seemed hopeful about me,\xe2\x80\x99 were words uttered\r\nwith a gladness enough to go to one\xe2\x80\x99s heart.  \xe2\x80\x98O Edward, I feel as if\r\nthere was some chance of \xe2\x80\x9csteadfastly purposing\xe2\x80\x9d this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was not the way of the family to say much of religious feeling, and\r\nthis was much for Clarence to utter.  He looked white and tired, but\r\nthere was an air of rest and peace about him, above all when my mother\r\nmet him with a very real kiss.  Moreover, Mr. Castleford had taken care\r\nto brighten our Christmas with a letter expressive of great satisfaction\r\nwith Clarence for steadiness and intelligence.  Even Mr. Frith allowed\r\nthat he was the most punctual of all those young dogs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do believe,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, \xe2\x80\x98that his piety is doing him some good\r\nafter all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo our mutual wishes of a happy Christmas were verified, though not much\r\naccording to the notions of this half of the century.  People made their\r\nChristmas day either mere merriment, or something little different from\r\nthe grave Sunday of that date.  And ours, except for the Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s dining\r\nwith us, had always been of the latter description, all the more that\r\nwhen celebrations of the Holy Communion were so rare they were treated\r\nwith an awe and reverence which frequency has perhaps diminished, and a\r\nfeeling (possibly Puritanical) prevailed which made it appear incongruous\r\nto end with festivity a day so begun.  That we had a Christmas Day\r\nCommunion at all at Earlscombe was an innovation only achieved by Mr.\r\nHenderson going to assist the old Rector at Wattlesea; and there were no\r\ncommunicants except from our house, besides Chapman, his daughter-in-law,\r\nand five old creatures between whom the alms were immediately divided.\r\nWe afterwards learnt that our best farmer and his wife were much\r\ndisappointed at the change from Sunday interfering with the family\r\njollification; and Mrs. Sophia Selby was annoyed at the contradiction to\r\nher habits under the rule of her poor dear uncle.\r\n\r\nOf the irregularities, irreverences, and squalor of the whole I will not\r\nspeak.  They were not then such stumbling-blocks as they would be now,\r\nand many passed unperceived by us, buried as we were in our big pew, with\r\nour eyes riveted on our books; yet even thus there was enough evident to\r\nmake my mother rejoice that Mr. Henderson would be with us before Easter.\r\nStill this could not mar the thankful gladness that was with us all that\r\nday, and which shone in Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.  His countenance always had a\r\nremarkable expression in church, as if somehow his spirit went farther\r\nthan ours did, and things unseen were more real to him.\r\n\r\nHillside, as usual, had two services, and my father and his friend were\r\ngoing to walk thither in the afternoon, but it was a raw cold day,\r\nthreatening snow, and Emily was caught by my mother in the hail and\r\nordered back, as well as Clarence, who had shown symptoms of having\r\ncaught cold on his dismal journey.  Emily coaxed from her permission to\r\nhave a fire in the bookroom, and there we three had a memorably happy\r\ntime.  We read our psalms and lessons, and our _Christian Year_, which\r\nwas more and more the lodestar of our feelings.  We compared our\r\nfavourite passages, and discussed the obscurer ones, and Clarence was led\r\nto talk out more of his heart than he had ever shown to us before.\r\nPerhaps he had lost some of his reserve through his intercourse with our\r\ngood old governess, Miss Newton, who was still grinding away at her daily\r\nmill, though with somewhat failing eyesight, so that she could do nothing\r\nbut knit in the long evenings, and was most grateful to her former pupil\r\nfor coming, as often as he could, to talk or read to her.\r\n\r\nShe was a most excellent and devout woman, and when Emily, who in\r\nyouthful _gaiet\xc3\xa9 de c\xc5\x93ur_ had got a little tired of her, exclaimed at his\r\ntaste, and asked if she made him read nothing but Pike\xe2\x80\x99s Early _Piety_,\r\nhe replied gravely, \xe2\x80\x98She showed me where to lay my burthen down,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nturned to the two last verses of the poem for \xe2\x80\x98Good Friday\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\n_Christian Year_, as well as to the one we had just read on the Holy\r\nCommunion.\r\n\r\nMy father\xe2\x80\x99s kindness had seemed to him the pledge of the Heavenly\r\nFather\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness; and he added, perhaps a little childishly, that it\r\nhad been his impulse to promise never to touch a card again, but that he\r\ndreaded the only too familiar reply, \xe2\x80\x98What availed his promises?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do promise, Clarry!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Emily, \xe2\x80\x98and then you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to play with\r\nthat tiresome old Mrs. Sophia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would rather deter me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A card-playing old age is despicable,\xe2\x80\x99 pronounced Miss Emily, much to\r\nour amusement.\r\n\r\nAfter that we got into a bewilderment.  We knew nothing of the future\r\nquestion of temperance _versus_ total abstinence; but after it had been\r\nextracted that Miss Newton regarded cards as the devil\xe2\x80\x99s books, the\r\ninconsistent little sister changed sides, and declared it narrow and\r\nevangelical to renounce what was innocent.  Clarence argued that what\r\nmight be harmless for others might be dangerous for such as himself, and\r\nthat his real difficulty in making even a mental vow was that, if broken,\r\nthere was an additional sin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not oneself that one trusts,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence emphatically; \xe2\x80\x98and setting up a vow seems as if it\r\nmight be sticking up the reed of one\xe2\x80\x99s own word, and leaning on\r\n_that_\xe2\x80\x94when it breaks, at least mine does.  If I could always get the\r\ngrasp of Him that I felt to-day, there would be no more bewildered heart\r\nand failing spirit, which are worse than the actual falls they cause.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd as Emily said she did not understand, he replied in words I wrote\r\ndown and thought over, \xe2\x80\x98What we _are_ is the point, more than even what\r\nwe _do_.  We _do_ as we _are_; and yet we form ourselves by what we\r\n_do_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And,\xe2\x80\x99 I put in, \xe2\x80\x98I know somebody who won a victory last night over\r\nhimself and his two brothers.  Surely _doing_ that is a sign that he _is_\r\nmore than he used to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If he were, it would not have been an effort at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, but\r\nwith his rare sweet smile.\r\n\r\nJust then Griff called him away, and Emily sat pondering and impressed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It did seem so odd,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that Clarry should be so much the best,\r\nand yet so much the worst of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI agreed.  His insight into spiritual things, and his enjoyment of them,\r\nalways humiliated us both, yet he fell so much lower in practice,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98But\r\nthen we had not his temptations.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily; \xe2\x80\x98but look at Griff!  He goes about like other young\r\nmen, and keeps all right, and yet he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about religious things\r\na bit more than he can help.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was quite true.  Religion was life to the one and an insurance to the\r\nother, and this had been a mystery to us all our young lives, as far as\r\nwe had ever reflected on the contrast between the practical failure and\r\nsuccess of each.  Our mother, on the other hand, viewed Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntendencies as part of an unreal, self-deceptive nature, and regretted his\r\nintimacy with Miss Newton, who, she said, had fostered \xe2\x80\x98that kind of\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x99 in his childhood\xe2\x80\x94made him fancy talk, feeling, and preaching were\r\nmore than truth and honour\xe2\x80\x94and might lead him to run after Irving,\r\nRowland Hill, or Baptist Noel, about whose tenets she was rather\r\nconfused.  It would be an additional misfortune if he became a fanatical\r\nEvangelical light, and he was just the character to be worked upon.\r\n\r\nMy father held that she might be thankful for any good influence or safe\r\nresort for a young man in lodgings in London, and he merely bade Clarence\r\nnever resort to any variety of dissenting preacher.  We were of the\r\nschool called\xe2\x80\x94a little later\xe2\x80\x94high and dry, but were strictly orthodox\r\naccording to our lights, and held it a prime duty to attend our parish\r\nchurch, whatever it might be; nor, indeed, had Clarence swerved from\r\nthese traditions.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Sophia was baulked of the game at whist, which she viewed as a\r\nlegitimate part of the Christmas pleasures; and after we had eaten our\r\nturkey, we found the evening long, except that Martyn escaped to\r\nsnapdragon with the servants; and, by and by, Chapman, magnificent in\r\npatronage, ushered in the church singers into the hall, and clarionet,\r\nbassoon, and fiddle astonished our ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE MULLION CHAMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98A lady with a lamp I see,\r\n    Pass through the glimmering gloom,\r\n       And flit from room to room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                               LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nFOR want of being able to take exercise, the first part of the night had\r\nalways been sleepless with me, though my dear mother thought it wrong to\r\nrecognise the habit or allow me a lamp.  A fire, however, I had, and by\r\nits light, on the second night after Christmas, I saw my door noiselessly\r\nopened, and Clarence creeping in half-dressed and barefooted.  To my\r\nfrightened interrogation the answer came, through chattering teeth, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nI\xe2\x80\x94only I\xe2\x80\x94Ted\xe2\x80\x94no\xe2\x80\x94nothing\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, only I can\xe2\x80\x99t stand it any longer!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis hands were cold as ice when he grasped mine, as if to get hold of\r\nsomething substantial, and he trembled so as to shake the bed.  \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nroom,\xe2\x80\x99 he faltered.  \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x99Tis not only the moans!  I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whom?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  There she stands with her lamp, crying!\xe2\x80\x99  I could\r\nscarcely distinguish the words through the clashing of his teeth, and as\r\nI threw my arms round him the shudder seemed to pass to me; but I did my\r\nbest to warm him by drawing the clothes over him, and he began to gather\r\nhimself together, and speak intelligibly.  There had been sounds the\r\nfirst night as of wailing, but he had been too much preoccupied to attend\r\nto them till, soon after one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, they ended in a heavy fall and long\r\nshriek, after which all was still.  Christmas night had been undisturbed,\r\nbut on this the voices had begun again at eleven, and had a strangely\r\nhuman sound; but as it was windy, sleety weather, and he had learnt at\r\nsea to disregard noises in the rigging, he drew the sheet over his head\r\nand went to sleep.  \xe2\x80\x98I was dreaming that I was at sea,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98as I\r\nalways do on a noisy night, but this was not a dream.  I was wakened by a\r\nlight in the room, and there stood a woman with a lamp, moaning and\r\nsobbing.  My first notion was that one of the maids had come to call me,\r\nand I sat up; but I could not speak, and she gave another awful\r\nsuppressed cry, and moved towards that walled-up door.  Then I saw it was\r\nnone of the servants, for it was an antique dress like an old picture.\r\nSo I knew what it must be, and an unbearable horror came over me, and I\r\nrushed into the outer room, where there was a little fire left; but I\r\nheard her going on still, and I could endure it no longer.  I knew you\r\nwould be awake and would bear with me, so I came down to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen this was what Chapman and the maids had meant.  This was Mrs. Sophia\r\nSelby\xe2\x80\x99s vulgar superstition!  I found that Clarence had heard none of the\r\nmysterious whispers afloat, and only knew that Griff had deserted the\r\nroom after his own return to London.  I related what I had learnt from\r\nthe old lady, and in that midnight hour we agreed that it could be no\r\nmere fancy or rumour, but that cruel wrong must have been done in that\r\nchamber.  Our feeling was that all ought to be made known, and in that\r\nimpression we fell asleep, Clarence first.\r\n\r\nBy and by I found him moving.  He had heard the clock strike four, and\r\nthought it wiser to repair to his own quarters, where he believed the\r\ndisturbance was over.  Lucifer matches as yet were not, but he had always\r\nbeen a noiseless being, with a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s foot, so that, by the help of the\r\nmoonlight through the hall windows, he regained his room.\r\n\r\nAnd when morning had come, the nocturnal visitation wore such a different\r\naspect to both our minds that we decided to say nothing to our parents,\r\nwho, said Clarence, would simply disbelieve him; and, indeed, I inclined\r\nto suppose it had been an uncommonly vivid dream, produced in that\r\nsensitive nature by the uncanny sounds of the wind in the chinks and\r\ncrannies of the ancient chamber.  Had not Scott\xe2\x80\x99s _Demonology and\r\nWitchcraft_, which we studied hard on that day, proved all such phantoms\r\nto be explicable?  The only person we told was Griff, who was amused and\r\nincredulous.  He had heard the noises\xe2\x80\x94oh yes! and objected to having his\r\nsleep broken by them.  It was too had to expose Clarence to them\xe2\x80\x94poor\r\nBill\xe2\x80\x94on whom they worked such fancies!\r\n\r\nHe interrogated Chapman, however, but probably in that bantering way\r\nwhich is apt to produce reserve.  Chapman never \xe2\x80\x98gave heed to them\r\nfictious tales,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; but, when hard pressed, he allowed that he had\r\n\xe2\x80\x98heerd that a lady do walk o\xe2\x80\x99 winter nights,\xe2\x80\x99 and that was why the garden\r\ndoor of the old rooms was walled up.  Griff asked if this was done for\r\nfear she should catch cold, and this somewhat affronted him, so that he\r\naverred that he knew nought about it, and gave no thought to such like.\r\n\r\nJust then they arrived at the Winslow Arms, and took each a glass of ale,\r\nwhen Griff, partly to tease Chapman, asked the landlady\xe2\x80\x94an old Chantry\r\nHouse servant\xe2\x80\x94whether she had ever met the ghost.  She turned rather\r\npale, which seemed to have impressed him, and demanded if he had seen it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It always walked at Christmas time\xe2\x80\x94between then and the New Year.\xe2\x80\x99  She\r\nhad once seen a light in the garden by the ruin in winter-time, and once\r\nlast spring it came along the passage, but that was just before the old\r\nSquire was took for death,\xe2\x80\x94folks said that was always the way before any\r\nof the family died\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse it, sir.\xe2\x80\x99  Oh no, she thought\r\nnothing of such things, but she had heard tell that the noises were such\r\nat all times of the year that no one could sleep in the rooms, but the\r\nlight wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be seen except at Christmas.\r\n\r\nGriff with the philosophy of a university man, was certain that all was\r\nexplained by Clarence having imbibed the impression of the place being\r\nhaunted; and going to sleep nervous at the noises, his brain had shaped a\r\nphantom in accordance.  Let Clarence declare as he might that the legends\r\nwere new to him, Griff only smiled to think how easily people forgot, and\r\nhe talked earnestly about catching ideas without conscious information.\r\n\r\nHowever, he volunteered to sit up that night to ascertain the exact\r\ncauses of the strange noises and convince Clarence that they were nothing\r\nbut the effects of draughts.  The fire in his gunroom was surreptitiously\r\nkept up to serve for the vigil, which I ardently desired to share.  It\r\nwas an enterprise; it would gratify my curiosity; and besides, though\r\nGriffith was good-natured and forbearing in a general way towards\r\nClarence, I detected a spirit of mockery about him which might break out\r\nunpleasantly when poor Clarry was convicted of one of his unreasonable\r\npanics.\r\n\r\nBoth brothers were willing to gratify me, the only difficulty being that\r\nthe tap of my crutches would warn the entire household of the expedition.\r\nHowever, they had\xe2\x80\x94all unknown to my mother\xe2\x80\x94several times carried me about\r\nqueen\xe2\x80\x99s cushion fashion, as, being always much of a size, they could do\r\nmost handily; and as both were now fine, strong, well-made youths of\r\ntwenty and nineteen, they had no doubt of easily and silently conveying\r\nme up the shallow-stepped staircase when all was quiet for the night.\r\n\r\nEmily, with her sharp ears, guessed that something was in hand, but we\r\npromised her that she should know all in time.  I believe Griff, being a\r\nlittle afraid of her quickness, led her to suppose he was going to hold\r\nwhat he called a symposium in his rooms, and to think it a mystery of\r\ncollege life not intended for young ladies.\r\n\r\nHe really had prepared a sort of supper for us when, after my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nresounding turn of the key of the drawing-room door, my brothers, in\r\ntheir stocking soles, bore me upstairs, the fun of the achievement for\r\nthe moment overpowering all sense of eeriness.  Griff said he could not\r\nreceive me in his apartment without doing honour to the occasion, and\r\nthat Dutch courage was requisite for us both; but I suspect it was more\r\nin accordance with Oxford habits that he had provided a bottle of sherry\r\nand another of ale, some brandy cherries, bread, cheese, and biscuits, by\r\nwhat means I do not know, for my mother always locked up the wine.  He\r\nwas disappointed that Clarence would touch nothing, and declared that\r\ninanition was the preparation for ghost-seeing or imagining.  I drank his\r\nhealth in a glass of sherry as I looked round at the curious old room,\r\nwith its panelled roof, the heraldic devices and badges of the Power\r\nfamily, and the trophy of swords, dirks, daggers, and pistols, chiefly\r\nrelics of our naval grandfather, but reinforced by the sword, helmet, and\r\nspurs of the county Yeomanry which Griff had joined.\r\n\r\nGriff proposed cards to drive away fancies, especially as the sounds were\r\nbeginning; but though we generally yielded to him we _could_ not give our\r\nattention to anything but these.  There was first a low moan.  \xe2\x80\x98No great\r\nharm in that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff; \xe2\x80\x98it comes through that crack in the wainscot\r\nwhere there is a sham window.  Some putty will put a stop to that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen came a more decided wail and sob much nearer to us.  Griff hastily\r\nswallowed the ale in his tumbler, and, striking a theatrical attitude,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Angels and ministers of grace defend us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence held up his hand in deprecation.  The door into his bedroom was\r\nopen, and Griff, taking up one of the flat candlesticks, pursued his\r\nresearches, holding the flame to all chinks or cracks in the wainscotting\r\nto detect draughts which might cause the dreary sounds, which were much\r\nmore like suppressed weeping than any senseless gust of wind.  Of\r\ndraughts there were many, and he tried holding his hand against each\r\ncrevice to endeavour to silence the wails; but these became more human\r\nand more distressful.  Presently Clarence exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 and on his\r\nface there was a whiteness and an expression which always recurs to me on\r\nreading those words of Eliphaz the Temanite, \xe2\x80\x98Then a spirit passed before\r\nmy face, and the hair of my flesh stood up.\xe2\x80\x99  Even Griff was awestruck as\r\nwe cried, \xe2\x80\x98Where? what?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see her?  There!  By the press\xe2\x80\x94look!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see a patch of moonlight on the wall,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Moonlight\xe2\x80\x94her lamp.  Edward, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI could see nothing but a spot of light on the wall.  Griff (plainly\r\nputting a force on himself) came back and gave him a good-natured shake.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dreaming again, old Bill.  Wake up and come to your senses.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am as much in my senses as you are,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.  \xe2\x80\x98I see her as\r\nplainly as I see you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNor could any one doubt either the reality of the awe in his voice and\r\ncountenance, nor of the light\xe2\x80\x94a kind of hazy ball\xe2\x80\x94nor of the choking\r\nsobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What is she like?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, holding his hand, for, though infected by\r\nhis dread, my fears were chiefly for the effect on him; but he was much\r\ncalmer and less horror-struck than on the previous night, though still he\r\nshuddered as he answered in a low voice, as if loth to describe a lady in\r\nher presence, \xe2\x80\x98A dark cloak with the hood fallen back, a kind of lace\r\nheaddress loosely fastened, brown hair, thin white face, eyes\xe2\x80\x94oh, poor\r\nthing!\xe2\x80\x94staring with fright, dark\xe2\x80\x94oh, how swollen the lids! all red below\r\nwith crying\xe2\x80\x94black dress with white about it\xe2\x80\x94a widow kind of look\xe2\x80\x94a glove\r\non the arm with the lamp.  Is she beckoning\xe2\x80\x94looking at us?  Oh, you poor\r\nthing, if I could tell what you mean!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI felt the motion of his muscles in act to rise, and grasped him.  Griff\r\nheld him with a strong hand, hoarsely crying, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t follow\r\nthe thing, whatever you do!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence hid his face.  It was very awful and strange.  Once the thought\r\nof conjuring her to speak by the Holy Name crossed me, but then I saw no\r\nfigure; and with incredulous Griffith standing by, it would have been\r\nlike playing, nor perhaps could I have spoken.  How long this lasted\r\nthere is no knowing; but presently the light moved towards the walled-up\r\ndoor and seemed to pass into it.  Clarence raised his head and said she\r\nwas gone.  We breathed freely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The farce is over,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff.  \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Edward Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s carriage stops\r\nthe way!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI was hoisted up, candle in hand, between the two, and had nearly reached\r\nthe stairs when there came up on the garden side a sound as of tipsy\r\nrevellers in the garden.  \xe2\x80\x98The scoundrels! how can they have got in?\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried Griff, looking towards the window; but all the windows on that side\r\nhad peculiarly heavy shutters and bars, with only a tiny heart-shaped\r\naperture very high up, so they somewhat hurried their steps downstairs,\r\nintending to rush out on the intruders from the back door.  But suddenly,\r\nin the middle of the staircase, we heard a terrible heartrending woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshriek, making us all start and have a general fall.  My brothers managed\r\nto seat me safely on a step without much damage to themselves, but the\r\ncandle fell and was extinguished, and we made too heavy a weight to fall\r\nwithout real noise enough to bring the household together before we could\r\npick ourselves up in the dark.\r\n\r\nWe heard doors opening and hurried calls, and something about pistols,\r\nimpelling Griff to call out, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, papa; but there are some\r\ndrunken rascals in the garden.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA light had come by this time, and we were detected.  There was a general\r\nsally upon the enemy in the garden before any one thought of me, except a\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You here!\xe2\x80\x99 when they nearly fell over me.  And there I was left sitting\r\non the stair, helpless without my crutches, till in a few minutes all\r\nreturned declaring there was nothing\xe2\x80\x94no signs of anything; and then as\r\nClarence ran up to me with my crutches my father demanded the meaning of\r\nmy being there at that time of night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff, \xe2\x80\x98it is only that we have been sitting up to\r\ninvestigate the ghost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ghost!  Arrant stuff and nonsense!  What induced you to be dragging\r\nEdward about in this dangerous way?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wished it,\xe2\x80\x99 said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are all mad together, I think.  I won\xe2\x80\x99t have the house disturbed for\r\nthis ridiculous folly.  I shall look into it to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nRATIONAL THEORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \xe2\x80\x98These are the reasons, they are natural.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                           _Julius C\xc3\xa6sar_.\r\n\r\nIF anything could have made our adventure more unpleasant to Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWinslow, it would have been the presence of guests.  However, inquiry was\r\nsuppressed at breakfast, in deference to the signs my mother made to\r\nenjoin silence before the children, all unaware that Emily was nearly\r\nfrantic with suppressed curiosity, and Martyn knew more about the popular\r\nversion of the legend than any of us.\r\n\r\nClarence looked wan and heavy-eyed.  His head was aching from a bump\r\nagainst the edge of a step, and his cold was much worse; no wonder, said\r\nmy mother; but she was always softened by any ailment, and feared that\r\nthe phantoms were the effect of coming illness.  I have always thought\r\nthat if Clarence could have come home from his court-martial with a brain\r\nfever he would have earned immediate forgiveness; but unluckily for him,\r\nhe was a very healthy person.\r\n\r\nAll three of us were summoned to the tribunal in the study, where my\r\nfather and my mother sat in judgment on what they termed \xe2\x80\x98this\r\npreposterous business.\xe2\x80\x99  In our morning senses our impressions were much\r\nmore vague than at midnight, and we betrayed some confusion; but Griff\r\nand I had a strong instinct of sheltering Clarence, and we stoutly\r\ndeclared the noises to be beyond the capacities of wind, rats, or cats;\r\nthat the light was visible and inexplicable; and that though we had seen\r\nnothing else, we could not doubt that Clarence did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thought he did,\xe2\x80\x99 corrected my father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Without discussing the word,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff, \xe2\x80\x98I mean that the effect on his\r\nsenses was the same as the actual sight.  You could not look at him\r\nwithout being certain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so,\xe2\x80\x99 returned my mother.  \xe2\x80\x98I wish Dr. Fellowes were near.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIndeed nothing saved Clarence from being consigned to medical treatment\r\nbut the distance from Bath or Bristol, and the contradictory advice that\r\nhad been received from our county neighbours as to our family doctor.\r\nHowever, she formed her theory that his nervous imaginings\xe2\x80\x94whether\r\ninvoluntary or acted, she hoped the former, and wished she could be\r\nsure\xe2\x80\x94had infected us; and, as she was really uneasy about him, she would\r\nnot let him sleep in the mullion room, but having nowhere else to bestow\r\nhim, she turned out the man-servant and put him into the little room\r\nbeyond mine, and she also forbade any mention of the subject to him that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis was a sore prohibition to Emily, who had been discussing it with the\r\nother ladies, and was in a mingled state of elation at the romance, and\r\nterror at the supernatural, which found vent in excited giggle, and moved\r\nGriff to cram her with raw-head and bloody-bone horrors, conventional\r\nenough to be suspicious, and send her to me tearfully to entreat to know\r\nthe truth.  If by day she exulted in a haunted chamber, in the evening\r\nshe paid for it by terrors at walking about the house alone, and, when\r\nsent on an errand by my mother, looked piteous enough to be laughed at or\r\nscolded on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen had more serious colloquies, and the upshot was a\r\ndetermination to sit up together and discover the origin of the\r\nannoyance.  Mr. Stafford\xe2\x80\x99s antiquarian researches had made him familiar\r\nwith such mysteries, and enough of them had been explained by natural\r\ncauses to convince him that there was a key to all the rest.  Owls,\r\ncoiners, and smugglers had all been convicted of simulating ghosts.  In\r\none venerable mansion, behind the wainscot, there had been discovered\r\nnine skeletons of cats in different stages of decay, having trapped\r\nthemselves at various intervals of time, and during the gradual\r\nextinction of their eighty-one lives having emitted cries enough to\r\nestablish the ghastly reputation of the place.  Perhaps Mr. Henderson was\r\ninclined to believe there were more things in heaven and earth than were\r\ndreamt of in even an antiquary\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy.  He owned himself perplexed,\r\nbut reserved his opinion.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast Clarence was quite well, except for the remains of his sore\r\nthroat, and the two seniors were gruff and brief as to their watch.  They\r\nhad heard odd noises, and should discover the cause; the carpenter had\r\nalready been sent for, and they had seen a light which was certainly due\r\nto reflection or refraction.  Mr. Henderson committed himself to nothing\r\nbut that \xe2\x80\x98it was very extraordinary;\xe2\x80\x99 and there was a wicked look of\r\ndiversion on Griff\xe2\x80\x99s face, and an exchange of glances.  Afterwards, in\r\nour own domain, we extracted a good deal more from them.\r\n\r\nGriff told us how the two elders started on politics, and denounced\r\nBrougham and O\xe2\x80\x99Connell loud enough to terrify any save the most undaunted\r\nghost, till Henderson said \xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 and they paused at the moan with which\r\nthe performance always commenced, making Mr. Stafford turn, as Griff\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98white in the gills,\xe2\x80\x99 though he talked of the wind on the stillest\r\nof frosty nights.  Then came the sobbing and wailing, which certainly\r\noverawed them all; Henderson called them \xe2\x80\x98agonising,\xe2\x80\x99 but Griff was in a\r\nmanner inured to this, and felt as if master of the ceremonies.  Let them\r\nsay what they would by daylight about owls, cats, and rats, they owned\r\nthe human element then, and were far from comfortable, though they would\r\nnot compromise their good sense by owning what both their younger\r\ncompanions had perceived\xe2\x80\x94their feeling of some undefinable presence.\r\nVain attempts had been made to account for the light or get rid of it by\r\nchanging the position of candles or bright objects in the outer room; and\r\nHenderson had shut himself into the bedroom with it; but there he still\r\nonly saw the hazy light\xe2\x80\x94though all was otherwise pitch dark, except the\r\nkeyhole and the small gray patch of sky at the top of the\r\nwindow-shutters.  \xe2\x80\x98You saw nothing else?\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff.  \xe2\x80\x98I thought I heard\r\nyou break out as Clarence did, just before my father opened the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Perhaps I did so.  I had the sense strongly on me of some being in\r\ngrievous distress very near me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you should have power over it,\xe2\x80\x99 suggested Emily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98that more thorough conviction and comprehension\r\nare needed before I could address the thing with authority.  I should\r\nlike to have stayed longer and heard the conclusion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Stafford had grown impatient and weary, and my father having\r\nsatisfied himself that there was something to be detected, would not\r\nremain to the end, and not only carried his companions off, but locked\r\nthe doors, perhaps expecting to imprison some agent in a trick, and find\r\nhim in the morning.\r\n\r\nIndeed Clarence had a dim remembrance of having been half wakened by some\r\none looking in on him in the night, when he was sleeping heavily after\r\nhis cold and the previous night\xe2\x80\x99s disturbance, and we suspected, though\r\nwe would not say, that our father might have wished to ascertain that he\r\nhad no share in producing these appearances.  He was, however, fully\r\nacquitted of all wilful deception in the case, and he was not surprised,\r\nthough he was disappointed, that his vision of the lady was supposed to\r\nbe the consequence of excited imagination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to me in private.  \xe2\x80\x98I have always seen or\r\nfelt, or whatever you may call it, things that others do not.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nremember how nobody would believe that I saw Lucy Brooke?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That was in the beginning of the measles.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know; and I will tell you something curious.  When I was at Gibraltar\r\nI met Mrs. Emmott\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mary Brooke?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I spent a very happy Sunday with her.  We talked over old times,\r\nand she told me that Lucy had all through her illness been very uneasy\r\nabout having promised to bring me a macaw\xe2\x80\x99s feather the next time we\r\nplayed in the Square gardens.  It could not be sent to me for fear of\r\ncarrying the infection, but the dear girl was too light-headed to\r\nunderstand, and kept on fretting and wandering about breaking her word.\r\nI have no doubt the wish carried her spirit to me the moment it was\r\nfree,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, with tears springing to his eyes.  He also said that\r\nbefore the court-martial he had, night after night, dreams of sinking and\r\ndrowning in huge waves, and his friend Coles struggling to come to his\r\naid, but being forcibly withheld; and he had since learnt that Coles had\r\nactually endeavoured to come from Plymouth to bear testimony to his\r\nprevious character, but had been refused leave, and told that he could do\r\nno good.\r\n\r\nThere had been other instances of perception of a presence and of a\r\nprescient foreboding.  \xe2\x80\x98It is like a sixth sense,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and a very\r\nuncomfortable one.  I would give much to be rid of it, for it is\r\nconnected with all that is worst in my life.  I had it before Navarino,\r\nwhen no one expected an engagement.  It made me believe I should be\r\nkilled, and drove me to what was much worse\xe2\x80\x94or at least I used to think\r\nso.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you now?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.  \xe2\x80\x98It was a great mercy that I did not die then.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s something to conquer first.  But you\xe2\x80\x99ll never speak of this, Ted.\r\nI have left off telling of such things\xe2\x80\x94it only gives another reason for\r\ndisbelieving me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, this time his veracity was not called in question,\xe2\x80\x94but he was\r\nsupposed to be under a hallucination, the creation of the noises acting\r\non his imagination and memory of the persecuted widow, which must have\r\nbeen somewhere dormant in his mind, though he averred that he had never\r\nheard of it.  It had now, however, made a strong impression on him; he\r\nwas convinced that some crime or injustice had been perpetrated, and\r\nthought it ought to be investigated; but Griffith made us laugh at his\r\nchampionship of this shadow of a shade, and even wrote some mock heroic\r\nverses about it,\xe2\x80\x94nor would it have been easy to stir my father to seek\r\nfor the motives of an apparition which no one in the family save Clarence\r\nprofessed to have seen.\r\n\r\nThe noises were indisputable, but my mother began to suspect a cause for\r\nthem.  To oblige a former cook we had brought down with us as stable-boy\r\nher son, George Sims, an imp accustomed to be the pet and jester of a\r\nmews.  Martyn was only too fond of his company, and he made no secret of\r\nhis contempt for the insufferable dulness of the country, enlivening it\r\nby various acts of monkey-mischief, in some of which Martyn had been\r\nimplicated.  That very afternoon, as Mrs. Sophia Selby was walking home\r\nin the twilight from Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s lodge, in company with Mr. Henderson, an\r\neldritch yell proceeding from the vaults beneath the mullion chambers\r\nnearly frightened her into fits.  Henderson darted in and captured the\r\ntwo boys in the fact.  Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s asseveration that he had taken the pair\r\nfor Griff and Emily would have pacified the good-natured clergyman, but\r\nMrs. Sophia was too much agitated, or too spiteful, as we declared, not\r\nto make a scene.\r\n\r\nMartyn spent the evening alone and in disgrace, and only his\r\nunimpeachable character for truth caused the acceptance of his\r\naffirmation that the yell was an impromptu fraternal compliment, and that\r\nhe had nothing to do with the noises in the mullion chamber.  He had been\r\nsupposed to be perfectly unconscious of anything of the kind, and to have\r\nnever so much as heard of a phantom, so my mother was taken somewhat\r\naback when, in reply to her demand whether he had ever been so naughty as\r\nto assist George in making a noise in Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s room, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Why,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the ghost of the lady that was murdered atop of the steps, and\r\nalways walks every Christmas!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who told you such ridiculous nonsense?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe answer \xe2\x80\x98George\xe2\x80\x99 was deemed conclusive that all had been got up by\r\nthat youth; and there was considerable evidence of his talent for\r\nventriloquism and taste for practical jokes.  My mother was certain that,\r\nhaving heard of the popular superstition, he had acted ghost.  She\r\nappealed to _Woodstock_ to prove the practicability of such feats; and\r\nher absolute conviction persuaded the maids (who had given warning _en\r\nmasse_) that the enemy was exorcised when George Sims had been sent off\r\non the Royal Mail under Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s guardianship.\r\n\r\nNone of the junior part of the family believed him guilty, but he had\r\nhunted the cows round the paddock, mounted on my donkey, had nearly shot\r\nthe kitchen-maid with Griff\xe2\x80\x99s gun, and, if not much maligned, knew the\r\nway to the apple-chamber only too well,\xe2\x80\x94so that he richly deserved his\r\ndoom, rejoiced in it himself, and was unregretted save by Martyn.\r\nClarence viewed him in the light of a victim, and tried to keep an eye on\r\nhim, but he developed his talent as a ventriloquist, made his fortune,\r\nand retired on a public-house.\r\n\r\nMy mother would fain have had the vaults under the mullion rooms bricked\r\nup, but Mr. Stafford cried out on the barbarism of such a proceeding.\r\nThe mystery was declared to be solved, and was added to Mr. Stafford\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood stories of haunted houses.\r\n\r\nAnd at home my father forbade any further mention of such rank folly and\r\ndeception.  The inner mullion chamber was turned into a lumber-room, and\r\nas weeks passed by without hearing or seeing any more of lady or of lamp,\r\nwe began to credit the wonderful freaks of the goblin page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nCAT LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Soon as she parted thence\xe2\x80\x94the fearful twayne,\r\n    That blind old woman and her daughter deare,\r\n    Came forth, and finding Kirkrapine there slayne,\r\n    For anguish greate they gan to rend their heare\r\n    And beate their breasts, and naked flesh to teare;\r\n    And when they both had wept and wayled their fill,\r\n    Then forth they ran, like two amaz\xc3\xa8d deere,\r\n    Half mad through malice and revenging will,\r\n    To follow her that was the causer of their ill.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94SPENSER.\r\n\r\nTHE Christmas vacation was not without another breeze about Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexpenses at Oxford.  He held his head high, and declared that people\r\nexpected something from the eldest son of a man of property, and my\r\nfather tried to convince him that a landed estate often left less cash\r\navailable than did the fixed salary of an office.  Griff treated all in\r\nhis light, good-humoured way, promised to be careful, and came to me to\r\ncommiserate the poor old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s ignorance of the ways of the new\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThere ensued some trying weeks of dark days, raw frost, and black east\r\nwind, when the home party cast longing, lingering recollections back to\r\nthe social intercourse, lamp-lit streets, and ready interchange of books\r\nand other amenities we had left behind us.  We were not accustomed to\r\nhave our nearest neighbours separated from us by two miles of dirty lane,\r\nor road mended with excruciating stones, nor were they very congenial\r\nwhen we did see them.  The Fordyce family might be interesting, but we\r\nyounger ones could not forget the slight to Clarence, and, besides, the\r\ngirls seemed to be entirely in the schoolroom, Mrs. Fordyce was delicate\r\nand was shut up all the winter, and the only intercourse that took place\r\nwas when my father met the elder Mr. Fordyce at the magistrates\xe2\x80\x99 bench;\r\nalso there was a conference about Amos Bell, who was preferred to the\r\npost left vacant by George Sims, in right of his being our tenant, but\r\nmore civilised than Earlscombers, a widow\xe2\x80\x99s son, and not sufficiently\r\nrecovered from his accident to be exposed to the severe tasks of a\r\nploughboy in the winter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fordyce was the manager of a book-club, which circulated volumes\r\ncovered in white cartridge paper, with a printed list of the subscribers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnames.  Two volumes at a time might be kept for a month by each member in\r\nrotation, novels were excluded, and the manager had a veto on all orders.\r\nWe found her more liberal than some of our other neighbours, who looked\r\non our wants and wishes with suspicion as savouring of London notions.\r\nHappily we could read old books and standard books over again, and we\r\ngloated over _Blackwood_ and the _Quarterly_, enjoying, too, every\r\nout-of-door novelty of the coming spring, as each revealed itself.  Emily\r\nwill never forget her first primroses, nor I the first thrush in early\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBlankets, broth, and what were uncomfortably termed broken victuals had\r\nbeen given away during the winter, and a bewildering amount of begging\r\nwomen and children used to ask interviews with \xe2\x80\x98the Lady Winslow,\xe2\x80\x99 with\r\nstories that crumbled on investigation so as to make us recollect the\r\nRector\xe2\x80\x99s character of Earlscombe.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Henderson came in the second week of Lent, and what our\r\nsteps towards improvement introduced would have seemed almost as shocking\r\nto you youngsters, as what they displaced.  For instance, a plain crimson\r\ncloth covered the altar, instead of the rags in the colours of the\r\nWinslow livery, presented, according to the queer old register, by the\r\nunfortunate Margaret.  There was talk of velvet and the gold monogram,\r\nsurrounded by rays, alternately straight and wavy, as in our London\r\nchurch, but this was voted \xe2\x80\x98unfit for a plain village church.\xe2\x80\x99  Still,\r\nthe new hangings of pulpit, desk, and altar were all good in quality and\r\ncolour, and huge square cushions were provided as essential to each.\r\nMoreover, the altar vessels were made somewhat more respectable,\xe2\x80\x94all this\r\nbeing at my father\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\r\n\r\nHe also carried in the Vestry, though not without strong opposition from\r\na dissenting farmer, that new linen and a fresh surplice should be\r\nprovided by the parish, which surplice would have made at least six of\r\nsuch as are at present worn.  The farmers were very jealous of the\r\ninterference of the Squire in the Vestry\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98what he had no call to,\xe2\x80\x99 and of\r\nchurch rates applied to any other object than the reward of birdslayers,\r\nas thus, in the register\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nHairy Wills, 1 score sprows heds        2d.\r\nJems Brown, 1 poulcat                   6d.\r\nJarge Bell, 2 howls                     6d.\r\n\r\nIt was several years before this appropriation of the church rates could\r\nbe abolished.  The year 1830, with a brand new squire and parson, was too\r\nticklish a time for many innovations.\r\n\r\nHillside Church was the only one in the neighbourhood where Holy Week or\r\nAscension Day had been observed in the memory of man.  When we proposed\r\ngoing to church on the latter day the gardener asked my mother \xe2\x80\x98if it was\r\nher will to keep Thursday holy,\xe2\x80\x99 as if he expected its substitution for\r\nSunday.  Monthly Communions and Baptisms after the Second Lesson were\r\nviewed as \xe2\x80\x98not fit for a country church,\xe2\x80\x99 and every attempt at even more\r\nsecular improvements was treated with the most disappointing distrust and\r\naversion.  When my father laid out the allotment grounds, the labourers\r\nsuspected some occult design for his own profit, and the farmers objected\r\nthat the gardens would be used as an excuse for neglecting their work and\r\nstealing their potatoes.  Coal-club and clothing-club were regarded in\r\nlike manner, and while a few took advantage of these offers in a grudging\r\nmanner, the others viewed everything except absolute gifts as \xe2\x80\x98me-an\xe2\x80\x99 on\r\nour part, the principle of aid to self-help being an absolute novelty.\r\nWhen I look back to the notes in our journals of that date I see how much\r\nhas been overcome.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we listened more than was strictly wise to the revelations of\r\nAmos Bell, when he attended Emily and me on our expeditions with the\r\ndonkey.  Though living over the border of Hillside, he had a family of\r\nrelations at Earlscombe, and for a time lodged with his grandmother\r\nthere.  When his shyness and lumpishness gave way, he proved so bright\r\nthat Emily undertook to carry on his education.  He soon had a wonderful\r\neye for a wild flower, and would climb after it with the utmost agility;\r\nand when once his tongue was loosed, he became almost too communicative,\r\nand made us acquainted with the opinions of \xe2\x80\x98they Earlscoom folk\xe2\x80\x99 with a\r\nfreedom not to be found in an elder or a native.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he was the brightest light of the Sunday school which Mr.\r\nHenderson opened at once\xe2\x80\x94for want of a more fitting place\xe2\x80\x94in the disused\r\nnorth transept of the church.  It was an uncouth, ill-clad crew which\r\nassembled on those dilapidated paving tiles.  Their own grandchildren\r\nlook almost as far removed from them in dress and civilisation as did my\r\nsister in her white worked cambric dress, silk scarf, huge Tuscan bonnet,\r\nand the little curls beyond the lace quilling round her bright face, far\r\nrosier than ever it had been in town.  And what would the present\r\ngeneration say to the odd little contrivances in the way of cotton\r\nsun-bonnets, check pinafores, list tippets, and print capes, and other\r\nwonderful manufactures from the rag-bag, which were then grand prizes and\r\nstimulants?\r\n\r\nPrevious knowledge or intelligence scarcely existed, and then was not due\r\nto Dame Dearlove\xe2\x80\x99s tuition.  Mr. Henderson pronounced an authorised\r\nschool a necessity.  My father had scruples as to vested rights, for the\r\nold woman was the last survivor of a family who had had recourse to\r\nprimer and hornbook after their ejection on \xe2\x80\x98black Bartholomew\xe2\x80\x99s Day;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand when the meeting-house was built after the Revolution, had combined\r\npreaching with teaching.  Monopoly had promoted degeneracy, and this last\r\nof the race was an unfavourable specimen in all save outward\r\npicturesqueness.  However, much against Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s liking, an\r\naccommodation was proposed, by which books were to be supplied to her,\r\nand the Church Catechism be taught in her school, with the assistance of\r\nthe curate and Miss Winslow.\r\n\r\nThe terms were rejected with scorn.  No School Board could be more\r\ndetermined against the Catechism, nor against \xe2\x80\x98passons meddling wi\xe2\x80\x99 she;\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand as to assistance, \xe2\x80\x98she had been a governess this thirty year, and\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want no one trapesing in and out of her school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was warned, but probably did not believe in the possibility of an\r\nopposition school; and really there were children enough in the place to\r\noverfill both her room and that which was fitted up after a very humble\r\nfashion in one of our cottages.  H.M. Inspector would hardly have thought\r\nit even worth condemnation any more than the attainments of the mistress,\r\nthe young widow of a small Bristol skipper.  Her qualifications consisted\r\nin her piety and conscientiousness, good temper and excellent needlework,\r\ntogether with her having been a scholar in one of Mrs. Hannah More\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nschools in the Cheddar district.  She could read and teach reading well;\r\nbut as for the dangerous accomplishments of writing and arithmetic, such\r\nas desired to pass beyond the rudiments of them must go to Wattlesea.\r\n\r\nSo nice did she look in her black that Earlscombe voted her a mere town\r\nlady, and even at a penny a week hesitated to send its children to her.\r\nIndeed it was currently reported that her school was part of a deep and\r\nnefarious scheme of the gentlefolks for reducing the poor-rates by\r\nenticing the children, and then shipping them off to foreign parts from\r\nBristol.\r\n\r\nBut the great crisis was one unlucky summer evening when Emily and I were\r\nout with the donkey, and Griffith, just come home from Oxford, was airing\r\nthe new acquisition of a handsome black retriever.\r\n\r\nClose by the old chapel, a black cat was leisurely crossing the road.  At\r\nher dashed Nero, stimulated perhaps by an almost involuntary\r\nscss\xe2\x80\x94scss\xe2\x80\x94from his master, if not from Amos and me.  The cat flew up a\r\nlow wall, and stood at bay on the top on tiptoe, with bristling tail,\r\narched back, and fiery eyes, while the dog danced round in agony on his\r\nhind legs, barking furiously, and almost reaching her.  Female sympathy\r\never goes to the cat, and Emily screamed out in the fear that he would\r\nseize her, or even that Griff might aid him.  Perhaps Amos would have\r\ndone so, if left to himself; but Griff, who saw the cat was safe, could\r\nnot help egging on his dog\xe2\x80\x99s impotent rage, when in the midst, out flew\r\npussy\xe2\x80\x99s mistress, Dame Dearlove herself, broomstick in hand, using\r\nlanguage as vituperative as the cat\xe2\x80\x99s, and more intelligible.\r\n\r\nShe was about to strike the dog\xe2\x80\x94indeed I fancy she did, for there was a\r\nhowl, and Griff sprang to his defence with\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt my dog, I say!  He\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t touched the brute!  She can take care of herself.  Here, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhalf-a-crown for the fright,\xe2\x80\x99 as the cat sprang down within the wall, and\r\nNero slunk behind him.  But Dame Dearlove was not so easily appeased.\r\nHer blood was up after our long series of offences, and she broke into a\r\nregular tirade of abuse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s the way with you fine folk, thinking you can tread down poor\r\npeople like the dirt under your feet, and insult \xe2\x80\x99em when you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken\r\nthe bread out of the mouths of them that were here before you.  Passons\r\nand ladies a meddin\xe2\x80\x99 where no one ever set a foot before!  Ay, ay, but\r\nye\xe2\x80\x99ll all be down before long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGriff signed to us to go on, and thundered out on her to take care what\r\nshe was about and not be abusive; but this brought a fresh volley on him,\r\nheralded by a derisive laugh.  \xe2\x80\x98Ha! ha! fine talking for the likes of\r\nyou, Winslows that you are.  But there\xe2\x80\x99s a curse on you all!  The poor\r\nlady as was murdered won\xe2\x80\x99t let you be!  Why, there\xe2\x80\x99s one of you, poor\r\nhumpy object\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this savage attack on me, Griff waxed furious, and shouted at her to\r\nhold her confounded tongue, but this only diverted the attack on himself.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And as for you\xe2\x80\x94fine chap as ye think yourself, swaggering and swearing\r\nat poor folk, and setting your dog at them\xe2\x80\x94your time\xe2\x80\x99s coming.  Look out\r\nfor yourself.  It\xe2\x80\x99s well known as how the curse is on the first-born.\r\nThe Lady Margaret don\xe2\x80\x99t let none of \xe2\x80\x99em live to come after his father.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGriff laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x98There, we have had enough of this;\xe2\x80\x99 and in fact\r\nwe had already moved on, so that he had to make some long steps to\r\novertake us, muttering, \xe2\x80\x98So we\xe2\x80\x99ve started a Meg Merrilies!  My father\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t keep such a foul-mouthed hag in the parish long!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which I had to respond that her cottage belonged to the trustees of\r\nthe chapel, whereat he whistled.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he knew that we had heard\r\nher final denunciation, and we did not like to mention it to him,\r\nscarcely to each other, though Emily looked very white and scared.\r\n\r\nWe talked it over afterwards in private, and with Henderson, who\r\nconfessed that he had heard of the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s saying something of the\r\nkind to other persons.  We consulted the registers in hopes of confuting\r\nit, but did not satisfy ourselves.  The last Squire had lost his only son\r\nat school.  He himself had been originally second in the family, and in\r\nthe generation before him there had been some child-deaths, after which\r\nwe came back to a young man, apparently the eldest, who, according to\r\nMiss Selby\xe2\x80\x99s story, had been killed in a duel by one of the Fordyces.  It\r\nwas not comfortable, till I remembered that our family Bible recorded the\r\nbirth, baptism, and death of a son who had preceded Griffith, and only\r\nborne for a day the name afterwards bestowed on me.\r\n\r\nAnd Henderson, who was so little our elder as to discuss things on fairly\r\nequal grounds, had some very interesting talks with us two over ancestral\r\nsin and its possible effects, dwelling on the 18th of Ezekiel as a\r\ncomment on the Second Commandment.  Indeed, we agreed that the\r\nuncomfortable state of disaffection which, in 1830, was becoming only too\r\nmanifest in the populace, was the result of neglect in former ages, and\r\nthat, even in our own parish, the bitterness, distrust, and ingratitude\r\nwere due to the careless, riotous, and oppressive family whom we\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nTHE SIEGE OF HILLSIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Ferments arise, imprisoned factions roar,\r\n    Represt ambition struggles round the shore;\r\n    Till, overwrought, the general system feels\r\n    Its motion stop, or frenzy fire the wheels.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\nGRIFFITH had come straight home this year.  There were no Peacock\r\ngaieties to tempt him in London, for old Sir Henry had died suddenly soon\r\nafter the ball in December; nor was there much of a season that year,\r\nowing to the illness and death of George IV.\r\n\r\nA regiment containing two old schoolmates of his was at Bristol, and he\r\nspent a good deal of time there, and also in Yeomanry drill.  As autumn\r\ncame on we rejoiced in having so stalwart a protector, for the\r\nagricultural riots had begun, and the forebodings of another French\r\nRevolution seemed about to be realised.  We stayed on at Chantry House.\r\nMy father thought his duty lay there as a magistrate, and my mother would\r\nnot leave him; nor indeed was any other place much safer, certainly not\r\nLondon, whence Clarence wrote accounts of formidable mobs who were\r\nexpected to do more harm than they accomplished; though their hatred of\r\nthe hero of our country filled us with direful prognostications, and made\r\nus think of the guillotine, which was linked with revolution in our\r\nminds, before we had I beheld the numerous changes that followed upon the\r\nthirty years of peace in which we grew up.\r\n\r\nThe ladies did not much like losing so stalwart a defender when Griff\r\nreturned to Oxford; and Jane the housemaid went to bed every night with\r\nthe pepper-pot and a poker, the first wherewith to blind the enemy, the\r\nsecond to charge them with.  From our height we could more than once see\r\nblazing ricks, and were glad that the home farm was not in our own hands,\r\nand that our only stack of hay was a good way from the house.  When the\r\nonset came at last, it was December, and the enemy only consisted of\r\nabout thirty dreary-looking men and boys in smock-frocks and chalked or\r\nsmutted faces, armed only with sticks and an old gun diverted from its\r\npurpose of bird-scaring.  They shouted for food, money, and arms; but my\r\nfather spoke to them from the hall steps, told them they had better go\r\nhome and learn that the public-house was a worse enemy to them than any\r\nmachine that had ever been invented, and assured them that they would get\r\nno help from him in breaking the laws and getting themselves into\r\ntrouble.  A stone or two was picked up, whereupon he went back and had\r\nthe hall door shut and barred, the heavy shutters of the windows having\r\nall been closed already, so that we could have stood a much more severe\r\nsiege than from these poor fellows.  One or two windows were broken, as\r\nwell as the glass of the conservatory, and the flower beds were trampled;\r\nbut finding our fortress impregnable they sneaked away before dark.  We\r\nfared better than our neighbours, some of whom were seriously frightened,\r\nand suffered loss of property.  Old Mr. Fordyce had for many years past\r\nbeen an active magistrate\xe2\x80\x94that a clergyman should be on the bench having\r\nbeen quite correct according to the notions of his younger days; and in\r\nspite of his beneficence he incurred a good deal of unpopularity for\r\nwithstanding the lax good-nature which made his brother magistrates give\r\norders for parish relief refused to able-bodied paupers by their own\r\nVestries.  This was a mischievous abuse of the old poor-law times, which\r\nmade people dispose of every one\xe2\x80\x99s money save their own.  He had also\r\nbeen a keen sportsman; and though his son had given up field sports in\r\ndeference to higher notions of clerical duty (his wife\xe2\x80\x99s, as people\r\nsaid), the old man\xe2\x80\x99s feeling prompted him to severity on poachers.  Frank\r\nFordyce, while by far the most earnest, hardworking clergyman in the\r\nneighbourhood, worked off his superfluous energy on scientific farming,\r\nmaking the glebe and the hereditary estate as much the model farm as\r\nHillside was the model parish.  He had lately set up a threshing-machine\r\nworked by horses, which was as much admired by the intelligent as it was\r\nvituperated by the ignorant.\r\n\r\nNeither paupers nor poachers abounded in Hillside; the natives were\r\nchiefly tenants and employed on the property, and, between good\r\nmanagement and beneficence, there was little real want and much friendly\r\nconfidence and affection; and thus, in spite of surrounding riots,\r\nHillside seemed likely to be an exception, proving what could he done by\r\nrightful care and attention.  Nor indeed did the attack come from thence;\r\nbut the two parsons were bitterly hated by outsiders beyond the reach of\r\ntheir personal influence and benevolence.\r\n\r\nIt was on a Saturday evening, the day after Griff had come back for the\r\nChristmas vacation, that, as Emily was giving Amos his lesson, she saw\r\nthat the boy was crying, and after examination he let out that \xe2\x80\x98folk\r\nshould say that the lads were agoing to break Parson Fordy\xe2\x80\x99s machine and\r\nfire his ricks that very night;\xe2\x80\x99 but he would not give his authority, and\r\nwhen he saw her about to give warning, entreated, \xe2\x80\x98Now, dont\xe2\x80\x99ze say\r\nnothing, Miss Emily\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 she cried indignantly; \xe2\x80\x98do you think I could hear of such a thing\r\nwithout trying to stop it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Us says,\xe2\x80\x99 he blurted out, \xe2\x80\x98as how Winslows be always fain of ought as\r\nhappens to the Fordys\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are not such wicked Winslows as you have heard of,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Emily\r\nwith dignity; and she rushed off in quest of papa and Griff, but when she\r\nbrought them to the bookroom, Amos had decamped, and was nowhere to be\r\nfound that night.  We afterwards learnt that he lay hidden in the\r\nhay-loft, not daring to return to his granny\xe2\x80\x99s, lest he should be\r\nsuspected of being a traitor to his kind; for our lawless, untamed,\r\ndiscontented parish furnished a large quota to the rioters, and he has\r\nsince told me that though all seemed to know what was about to be done,\r\nhe did not hear it from any one in particular.\r\n\r\nIt was no time to make light of a warning, but very difficult to know\r\nwhat to do.  Rural police were non-existent; there were no soldiers\r\nnearer than Keynsham, and the Yeomanry were all in their own homesteads.\r\nHowever, the captain of Griff\xe2\x80\x99s troop, Sir George Eastwood, lived about\r\nthree miles beyond Wattlesea, and had a good many dependants in the\r\ncorps, so it was resolved to send him a note by the gardener, good James\r\nEllis, a steady, resolute man, on Emily\xe2\x80\x99s fast-trotting pony, while my\r\nfather and Griff should hasten to Hillside to warn the Fordyces, who were\r\nnot unlikely to be able to muster trustworthy defenders among their own\r\npeople, and might send the ladies to take shelter at Chantry House.\r\n\r\nMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s brave spirit disdained to detain an effective man for her own\r\nprotection, and the groom was to go to Hillside; he was in the Yeomanry,\r\nand, like Griff, put on his uniform, while my father had the Riot Act in\r\nhis pocket.  All the horses were thus absorbed, but Chapman and the\r\nman-servant followed on foot.\r\n\r\nNever did I feel my incapacity more than on that strange night, when\r\nEmily was flying about with Martyn to all the doors and windows in a wild\r\nstate of excitement, humming to herself\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98When the dawn on the mountain was misty and gray,\r\n    My true love has mounted his steed and away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy mother was equally restless, prolonging as much as possible the\r\npreparation of rooms for possible guests; and when she did come and sit\r\ndown, she netted her purse with vehement jerks, and scolded Emily for\r\njumping up and leaving doors open.\r\n\r\nAt last, after an hour according to the clock, but far more by our\r\nfeelings, wheels were heard in the distance; Emily was off like a shot to\r\nreconnoitre, and presently Martyn bounced in with the tidings that a pair\r\nof carriage lamps were coming up the drive.  My mother hurried out into\r\nthe hall; I made my best speed after her, and found her hastily undoing\r\nthe door-chain as she recognised the measured, courteous voice of old Mr.\r\nFordyce.  In a moment more they were all in the house, the old gentleman\r\ngiving his arm to his daughter-in-law, who was quite overcome with\r\ndistress and alarm; then came his tall, slim granddaughter, carrying her\r\nlittle sister with arms full of dolls, and sundry maid-servants completed\r\nthe party of fugitives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We are taking advantage of Mr. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s goodness,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old Rector.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He assured us that you would be kind enough to receive those who would\r\nonly be an encumbrance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but I must go back to Frank now that you and the children are safe,\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried the poor lady.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t send away the carriage; I must go back to\r\nFrank.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Mr. Fordyce, \xe2\x80\x98Frank is in no danger.  He\r\nwill get on much better for knowing you are safe.  Mrs. Winslow will tell\r\nyou so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy mother was enforcing this assurance, when the little girl\xe2\x80\x99s sobs burst\r\nout in spite of her sister, who had been trying to console her.  \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\nCelestina Mary,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, pointing to three dolls whom she had carried\r\nin clasped to her breast.  \xe2\x80\x98Poor Celestina Mary!  She is left behind, and\r\nEllen won\xe2\x80\x99t let me go and see if she is in the carriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear, if she is in the carriage, she will be quite safe in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but she will be so cold.  She had nothing on but Rosella\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\npetticoat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe distress was so real that I had my hand on the bell to cause a search\r\nto be instituted for the missing damsel, when Mrs. Fordyce begged me to\r\ndo no such thing, as it was only a doll.  The child, while endeavouring\r\nto shelter with a shawl the dolls, snatched in their night-gear from\r\ntheir beds, wept so piteously at the rebuff that her grandfather had\r\nnearly gone in quest of the lost one, but was stopped by a special\r\nentreaty that he would not spoil the child.  Martyn, however, who had\r\nbeen standing in open-mouthed wonder at such feeling for a doll,\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, don\xe2\x80\x99t cry.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and get it for you;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nrushed off to the stable-yard.\r\n\r\nThis episode had restored Mrs. Fordyce, and while providing some of our\r\nguests with wine, and others with tea, we heard the story, only\r\ninterrupted by Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s return from a vain search, and Anne\xe2\x80\x99s consequent\r\ntears, which, however, were somehow hushed and smothered by fears of\r\nbeing sent to bed, coupled with his promises to search every step of the\r\nway to-morrow.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that while the Fordyce family were at dinner, shouts, howls\r\nand yells had startled them.  The rabble had surrounded the Rectory,\r\nbawling out abuse of the parsons and their machines, and occasionally\r\nthrowing stones.  There was no help to be expected; the only hope was in\r\nthe strength of the doors and windows, and the knowledge that personal\r\nviolence was very uncommon; but those were terrible moments, and poor\r\nMrs. Fordyce was nearly dead with suppressed terror when her husband\r\ntried haranguing from an upper window, and was received with execrations\r\nand a volley of stones, while the glass crashed round him.\r\n\r\nAt that instant the shouts turned to yells of dismay, \xe2\x80\x98The so\xe2\x80\x99diers! the\r\nso\xe2\x80\x99diers!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOur party had found everything still and dark in the village, for in\r\ntruth the men had hidden themselves.  They were being too much attached\r\nto their masters to join in the attack, but were afraid of being\r\ncompelled to assist the rioters, and not resolute enough against their\r\nown class either to inform against them or oppose them.\r\n\r\nThrough the midnight-like stillness of the street rose the tumult around\r\nthe Rectory; and by the light of a few lanterns, and from the upper\r\nwindows, they could see a mass of old hats, smock-frocked shoulders, and\r\nthe tops of bludgeons; while at soonest, Sir George Eastwood\xe2\x80\x99s troop\r\ncould not be expected for an hour or more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We must get to them somehow,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father and Griff to one another;\r\nand Griff added, \xe2\x80\x98These rascals are arrant cowards, and they can\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\nthe number of us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen, before my father knew what he was about\xe2\x80\x94certainly before he could\r\nget hold of the Riot Act\xe2\x80\x94he found the stable lantern made over to him,\r\nand Griff\xe2\x80\x99s sword flashing in light, as, making all possible clatter and\r\njingling with their accoutrements, the two yeomen dashed among the\r\nthrong, shouting with all their might, and striking with the flat of\r\ntheir swords.  The rioters, ill-fed, dull-hearted men for the most\r\npart\xe2\x80\x94many dragged out by compulsion, and already terrified\xe2\x80\x94went tumbling\r\nover one another and running off headlong, bearing off with them (as we\r\nafterwards learnt) their leaders by their weight, taking the blows and\r\npushes they gave one another in their pell-mell rush for those of the\r\nsoldiery, and falling blindly against the low wall of the enclosure.  The\r\nonly difficulty was in clearing them out at the two gates of the drive.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Fordyce opened the door to hail his rescuers he was utterly\r\namazed to behold only three, and asked in a bewildered voice, \xe2\x80\x98Where are\r\nthe others?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere were two prisoners, Petty the ratcatcher, who had attempted some\r\nresistance and had been knocked down by Griff\xe2\x80\x99s horse, and a young lad in\r\na smock-frock who had fallen off the wall and hurt his knee, and who\r\nblubbered piteously, declaring that them chaps had forced him to go with\r\nthem, or they would duck him in the horse-pond.  They were supposed to be\r\ngiven in charge to some one, but were lost sight of, and no wonder!  For\r\njust then it was discovered that the machine shed was on fire.  The\r\nrioters had apparently detached one of their number to kindle the flame\r\nbefore assaulting the house.  The matter was specially serious, because\r\nthe stackyard was on a line with the Rectory, at some distance indeed,\r\nbut on lower ground; and what with barns, hay and wheat ricks, sheds,\r\ncowhouses and stables, all thatched, a big wood-pile, and a long\r\nold-fashioned greenhouse, there was almost continuous communication.\r\nClouds of smoke and an ominous smell were already perceptible on the\r\nwind, generated by the heat, and the loose straw in the centre of the\r\nfarmyard was beginning to be ignited by the flakes and sparks, carrying\r\nthe mischief everywhere, and rendering it exceedingly difficult to\r\nrelease the animals and drive them to a place of safety.  Water was\r\nscarce.  There were only two wells, besides the pump in the house, and a\r\nshallow pond.  The brook was a quarter of a mile off in the valley, and\r\nthe nearest engine, a poor feeble thing, at Wattlesea.  Moreover, the\r\nassailants might discover how small was the force of rescuers, and return\r\nto the attack.  Thus, while Griff, who had given amateur assistance at\r\nall the fires he could reach in London; was striving to organise\r\nresistance to this new enemy, my father induced the gentlemen to cause\r\nthe horses to be put to the various vehicles, and employ them in carrying\r\nthe women and children to Chantry House.  The old Rector was persuaded to\r\ngo to take care of his daughter-in-law, and she only thought of putting\r\nher girls in safety.  She listened to reason, and indeed was too much\r\nexhausted to move when once she was laid on the sofa.  She would not hear\r\nof going to bed, though her little daughter Anne was sent off with her\r\nnurse, grandpapa persuading her that Rosella and the others were very\r\nmuch tired.  When she was gone, he declared his fears that he had sat\r\ndown on Celestina\xe2\x80\x99s head, and showed so much compunction that we were\r\nmuch amused at his relief when Martyn assured him of having searched the\r\ncarriage with a stable lantern, so that whatever had befallen the lady he\r\nwas not the guilty person.  He really seemed more concerned about this\r\nthan at the loss of all his own barns and stores.  And little Anne was\r\ncertainly as lovely and engaging a little creature as ever I saw; while,\r\nas to her elder sister, in all the trouble and anxiety of the night, I\r\ncould not help enjoying the sight of her beautiful eager face and form.\r\nShe was tall and very slight, sylph-like, as it was the fashion to call\r\nit, but every limb was instinct with grace and animation.  Her face was,\r\nperhaps, rather too thin for robust health, though this enhanced the idea\r\nof her being all spirit, as also did the transparency of complexion,\r\ntinted with an exquisite varying carnation.  Her eyes were of a clear,\r\nbright, rather light brown, and were sparkling with the lustre of\r\nexcitement, her delicate lips parted, showing the pretty pearly teeth, as\r\nshe was telling Emily, in a low voice of enthusiasm, scarcely designed\r\nfor my ears, how glorious a sight our brother had been, riding there in\r\nhis glancing silver, bearing down all before him with his good sword,\r\nlike the Captal de Buch dispersing the Jacquerie.\r\n\r\nTo which Emily responded, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t you love the Captal de Buch?\xe2\x80\x99  And\r\ntheir friendship was cemented.\r\n\r\nNext I heard, \xe2\x80\x98And that you should have been so good after all my\r\nrudeness.  But I thought you were like the old Winslows; and instead of\r\nthat you have come to the rescue of your enemies.  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it beautiful?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no, not enemies,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily.  \xe2\x80\x98That was all over a hundred years\r\nago!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So my papa and grandpapa say,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Miss Fordyce; \xe2\x80\x98but the last Mr.\r\nWinslow was not a very nice man, and never would be civil to us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA report was brought that the glare of the fire could be seen over the\r\nhill from the top of the house, and off went the two young ladies to the\r\nleads, after satisfying themselves that Anne was asleep among her\r\nhomeless dolls.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Fordyce devoted himself to keeping up the spirits of his\r\ndaughter-in-law as the night advanced without any tidings, except that\r\nthe girls, from time to time, rushed down to tell us of fresh outbursts\r\nof red flame reflected in the sky, then that the glow was diminishing; by\r\nwhich time they were tired out, and, both sinking into a big armchair,\r\nthey went to sleep in each other\xe2\x80\x99s arms.  Indeed I believe we all dozed\r\nmore or less before any one returned from the scene of action\xe2\x80\x94at about\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nThe struggle with the flames had been very unequal.  The long tongues\r\nsoon reached the roof of the large barn, which was filled with straw, nor\r\ncould the flakes of burning thatch be kept from the stable, while the\r\nwater of the pond was soon reduced to mud.  Helpers began to flock in,\r\nbut who could tell which were trustworthy? and all were uncomprehending.\r\n\r\nThere was so little hope of saving the house that the removal of\r\neverything valuable was begun under my father\xe2\x80\x99s superintendence.  Frank\r\nFordyce was here, there, and everywhere; while Griffith, like a gallant\r\ngeneral, fought the foe with very helpless unmanageable forces.\r\nVillagers, male and female, had emerged and stood gaping round; but, let\r\nhim rage and storm as he might, they would not go and collect pails and\r\nbuckets and form a line to the brook.  Still less would they assist in\r\noverthrowing and carrying away the faggots of a big wood-pile so as to\r\ncut off the communication with the offices.  Only Chapman and one other\r\nman gave any help in this; and presently the stack caught, and Griff, on\r\nthe top, was in great peril of the faggots rolling down with him into the\r\nmiddle, and imprisoning him in the blazing pile.  \xe2\x80\x98I never felt so like\r\nDido,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff.\r\n\r\nThat woodstack gave fearful aliment to the roaring flame, which came on\r\nso fast that the destruction of the adjoining buildings quickly followed.\r\nThe Wattlesea engine had come, but the yard well was unattainable, and\r\nall that could be done was to saturate the house with water from its own\r\nwell, and cover the side with wet blankets; but these reeked with steam,\r\nand then shrivelled away in the intense glow of heat.\r\n\r\nHowever, by this time the Eastwood Yeomanry, together with some\r\nreasonable men, had arrived.  A raid was made on the cottages for\r\nbuckets, a chain formed to the river, and at last the fire was got under,\r\nhaving made a wreck of everything out-of-doors, and consumed one whole\r\nwing of the house, though the older and more esteemed portion was saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nTHE PORTRAIT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98When day was gone and night was come,\r\n       And all men fast asleep,\r\n    There came the spirit of fair Marg\xe2\x80\x99ret\r\n       And stood at William\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                          _Scotch Ballad_.\r\n\r\nWHEN I emerged from my room the next morning the phaeton was at the door\r\nto take the two clergymen to reconnoitre their abode before going to\r\nchurch.  Miss Fordyce went with them, and my father was for once about to\r\nleave his parish church to give them his sympathy, and join in their\r\nthanksgiving that neither life nor limb had been injured.  He afterwards\r\nsaid that nothing could have been more touching than old Mr. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner of mentioning this special cause for gratitude before the General\r\nThanksgiving; and Frank Fordyce, having had all his sermons burnt, gave a\r\nshort address extempore (a very rare and almost shocking thing at that\r\ndate), reducing half the congregation to tears, for they really loved\r\n\xe2\x80\x98the fam\xe2\x80\x99ly,\xe2\x80\x99 though they had not spirit enough to defend it; and their\r\npassiveness always remained a subject of pride and pleasure to the\r\nFordyces.  It was against the will of these good people that Petty, the\r\nratcatcher, was arrested, but he had been engaged in other outrages,\r\nthough this was the only one in which a dwelling-house had suffered.  And\r\nChapman observed that \xe2\x80\x98there was nothing to be done with such chaps but\r\nto string \xe2\x80\x99em up out of the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGriff had toiled that night till he was as stiff as a rheumatic old man\r\nwhen he came down only just in time for luncheon.  Mrs. Fordyce did not\r\nappear at all.  She was a fragile creature, and quite knocked up by the\r\nagitations of the night.  The gentlemen had visited the desolate rectory,\r\nand found that though the fine ancient kitchen had escaped, the pleasant\r\nliving rooms had been injured by the water, and the place could hardly be\r\nmade habitable before the spring.  They proposed to take a house in Bath,\r\nwhence Frank Fordyce could go and come for Sunday duty and general\r\nsuperintendence, but my parents were urgent that they should not leave us\r\nuntil after Christmas, and they consented.  Their larger possessions were\r\nto be stored in the outhouses, their lesser in our house, notably in the\r\ninner mullion chamber, which would thus be so blocked that there would be\r\nno question of sleeping in it.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Fordyce had ascertained that he might acquit himself of smashing\r\nCelestina Mary, for no remains appeared in the carriage; but a miserable\r\ntrunk was discovered in the ruins, which he identified\xe2\x80\x94though surely no\r\none else save the disconsolate parent could have done so.  Poor little\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s private possessions had suffered most severely of all, for her\r\nwhole nursery establishment had vanished.  Her surviving dolls were left\r\nhomeless, and devoid of all save their night-clothing, which concerned\r\nher much more than the loss of almost all her own garments.  For what\r\ndolls were to her could never have been guessed by us, who had forced\r\nEmily to disdain them; whereas they were children to the maternal heart\r\nof this lonely child.\r\n\r\nShe was quite a new revelation to us.  All the Fordyces were handsome;\r\nand her chestnut curls and splendid eyes, her pretty colour and\r\nunconscious grace, were very charming.  Emily was so near our own age\r\nthat we had never known the winsomeness of a little maid-child amongst\r\nus, and she was a perpetual wonder and delight to us.\r\n\r\nIndeed, from having always lived with her elders, she was an odd little\r\nold-fashioned person, advanced in some ways, and comically simple in\r\nothers.  Her doll-heart was kept in abeyance all Sunday, and it was only\r\non Monday that her anxiety for Celestina manifested itself with\r\nconsiderable vehemence; but her grandfather gravely informed her that the\r\nyoung lady was gone to an excellent doctor, who would soon effect a cure.\r\nThe which was quite true, for he had sent her to a toy-shop by one of the\r\nmaids who had gone to restore the ravage on the wardrobes, and who\r\nbrought her back with a new head and arms, her identity apparently not\r\nbeing thus interfered with.  The hoards of scraps were put under\r\nrequisition to re-clothe the survivors; and I won my first step in Miss\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s good graces by undertaking a knitted suit for Rosella.\r\n\r\nThe good little girl had evidently been schooled to repress her dread and\r\nrepugnance at my unlucky appearance, and was painfully polite, only\r\nshutting her eyes when she came to shake hands with me; but after Rosella\r\ncondescended to adopt me, we became excellent friends.  Indeed the\r\nfollowing conversation was overheard by Emily, and set down:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know, Martyn, there\xe2\x80\x99s a fairies\xe2\x80\x99 ring on Hillside Down?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mushrooms,\xe2\x80\x99 quoth Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?  They are the fairies\xe2\x80\x99 tables.  They come out and\r\nspread them with lily tablecloths at night, and have acorn cups for\r\ndishes, with honey in them.  And they dance and play there.  Well,\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Edward go and sit under the beech-tree at the edge till they\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would like it at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martyn.  \xe2\x80\x98He never goes out\r\nat odd times.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? when they come they begin to sing\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cSunday and Monday,\r\n    Monday and Tuesday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd if he was to sing nicely,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cWednesday and Thursday,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nthey would be so much pleased that they would make his back straight\r\nagain in a moment.  At least, perhaps Wednesday and Thursday would not\r\ndo, because the little tailor taught them those; but Friday makes them\r\nangry.  But suppose he made some nice verse\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cMonday and Tuesday\r\n    The fairies are gay,\r\n    Tuesday and Wednesday\r\n    They dance away\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think that would do as well, perhaps.  Do get him to do so, Martyn.  It\r\nwould be so nice if he was tall and straight.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDear little thing!  Martyn, who was as much her slave as was her\r\ngrandfather, absolutely made her shed tears over his history of our\r\naccident, and then caressed them off; but I believe he persuaded her that\r\nsuch a case might be beyond the fairies\xe2\x80\x99 reach, and that I could hardly\r\nget to the spot in secret, which, it seems, is an essential point.  He\r\nhad imagination enough to be almost persuaded of fairyland by her\r\nearnestness, and she certainly took him into doll-land.  He had a turn\r\nfor carpentry and contrivance, and he undertook that the Ladies Rosella,\r\netc., should be better housed than ever.  A great packing-case was routed\r\nout, and much ingenuity was expended, much delight obtained, in the\r\nprocess of converting it into a doll\xe2\x80\x99s mansion, and replenishing it with\r\nfurniture.  Some was bought, but Martyn aspired to make whatever he\r\ncould; I did a good deal, and I believe most of our achievements are\r\nstill extant.  Whatever we could not manage, Clarence was to accomplish\r\nwhen he should come home.\r\n\r\nHis arrival was, as usual, late in the evening; and, as before, he had\r\nthe little room within mine.  In the morning, as we were crossing the\r\nhall to the bright wood fire, around which the family were wont to\r\nassemble before prayers, he came to a pause, asking under his breath,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that?  Who\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is one of the Hillside pictures.  You know we have a great many\r\nthings here from thence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is _she_,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in a low, awe-stricken voice.  No need to say who\r\n_she_ meant.\r\n\r\nI had not paid much attention to the picture.  It had come with several\r\nmore, such as are rife in country houses, and was one of the worst of the\r\nlot, a poor imitation of Lely\xe2\x80\x99s style, with a certain air common to all\r\nthe family; but Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were riveted on it.  \xe2\x80\x98She looks younger,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said; \xe2\x80\x98but it is the same.  I could swear to the lip and the whole\r\nshape of the brow and chin.  No\xe2\x80\x94the dress is different.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor in the portrait, there was nothing on the head, and one long lock of\r\nhair fell on the shoulder of the low-cut white-satin dress, done in very\r\nheavy gray shading.  The three girls came down together, and I asked who\r\nthe lady was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?  You ought; for that is poor Margaret who married your\r\nancestor.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo more was said then, for the rest of the world was collecting, and then\r\neverybody went out their several ways.  Some tin tacks were wanted for\r\nthe dolls\xe2\x80\x99 house, and there were reports that Wattlesea possessed a\r\ndoll\xe2\x80\x99s grate and fire-irons.  The children were wild to go in quest of\r\nthem, but they were not allowed to go alone, and it was pronounced too\r\nfar and too damp for the elder sister, so that they would have been\r\ndisappointed, if Clarence\xe2\x80\x94stimulated by Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s kicks under the\r\ntable\xe2\x80\x94had not offered to be their escort.  When Mrs. Fordyce demurred, my\r\nmother replied, \xe2\x80\x98You may perfectly trust her with Clarence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know a safer squire,\xe2\x80\x99 rejoined my father.\r\n\r\nCommendation was so rare that Clarence quite blushed with pleasure; and\r\nthe pretty little thing was given into his charge, prancing and dancing\r\nwith pleasure, and expecting much more from sixpence and from Wattlesea\r\nthan was likely to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n      [Picture: \xe2\x80\x98That is poor Margaret who married your ancestor.\xe2\x80\x99]\r\n\r\nGriff went out shooting, and the two young ladies and I intended to spend\r\na very rational morning in the bookroom, reading aloud Mme. de La\r\nRochejaquelein\xe2\x80\x99s _Memoirs_ by turns.  Our occupations were, on Emily\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npart, completing a reticule, in a mosaic of shaded coloured beads no\r\nbigger than pins\xe2\x80\x99 heads, for a Christmas gift to mamma\xe2\x80\x94a most wearisome\r\nbusiness, of which she had grown extremely tired.  Miss Fordyce was\r\nelaborately copying our M\xc3\xbcller\xe2\x80\x99s print of Raffaelle\xe2\x80\x99s St. John in pencil\r\non cardboard, so as to be as near as possible a facsimile; and she had\r\ntrusted me to make a finished water-coloured drawing from a rough sketch\r\nof hers of the Hillside barn and farm-buildings, now no more.\r\n\r\nIn a pause Ellen Fordyce suddenly asked, \xe2\x80\x98What did you mean about that\r\npicture?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only Clarence said it was like\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99 and here Emily came to a dead stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Grandpapa says it is like me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Fordyce.  \xe2\x80\x98What, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\n_that_?  Oh! oh! oh! is it true?  Does she walk?  Have you seen her?\r\nMamma calls it all nonsense, and would not have Anne hear of it for\r\nanything; but old Aunt Peggy used to tell me, and I am sure grandpapa\r\nbelieves it, just a little.  Have you seen her?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only Clarence has, and he knew the picture directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was much impressed, and on slight persuasion related the story, which\r\nshe had heard from an elder sister of her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s, and which had\r\nperhaps been the more impressed on her by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s consternation at\r\n\xe2\x80\x98such folly\xe2\x80\x99 having been communicated to her.  Aunt Peggy, who was much\r\nolder than her brother, had died only four years ago, at eighty-eight,\r\nhaving kept her faculties to the last, and handed down many traditions to\r\nher great-niece.  The old lady\xe2\x80\x99s father had been contemporary with the\r\nMargaret of ghostly fame, so that the stages had been few through which\r\nit had come down from 1708 to 1830.\r\n\r\nI wrote it down at once, as it here stands.\r\n\r\nMargaret was the only daughter of the elder branch of the Fordyces.  Her\r\nfather had intended her to marry her cousin, the male heir on whom the\r\nHillside estates and the advowson of that living were entailed; but\r\nbefore the contract had been formally made, the father was killed by\r\naccident, and through some folly and ambition of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s (such\r\nseemed to be the Fordyce belief), the poor heiress was married to Sir\r\nJames Winslow, one of the successful intriguers of the days of the later\r\nStewarts, and with a family nearly as old, if not older, than herself.\r\nHer own children died almost at their birth, and she was left a young\r\nwidow.  Being meek and gentle, her step-sons and daughters still ruled\r\nover Chantry House.  They prevented her Hillside relations from having\r\naccess to her whilst in a languishing state of health, and when she died\r\nunexpectedly, she was found to have bequeathed all her property to her\r\nstep-son, Philip Winslow, instead of to her blood relations, the\r\nFordyces.\r\n\r\nThis was certain, but the Fordyce tradition was that she had been kept\r\nshut up in the mullion chambers, where she had often been heard weeping\r\nbitterly.  One night in the winter, when the gentlemen of the family had\r\ngone out to a Christmas carousal, she had endeavoured to escape by the\r\nsteps leading to the garden from the door now bricked up, but had been\r\nmet by them and dragged back with violence, of which she died in the\r\ncourse of a few days; and, what was very suspicious, she had been\r\nentirely attended by her step-daughter and an old nurse, who never would\r\nlet her own woman come near her.\r\n\r\nThe Fordyces had thought of a prosecution, but the Winslows had powerful\r\ninterest at Court in those corrupt times, and contrived to hush up the\r\nmatter, as well as to win the suit in which the Fordyces attempted to\r\nprove that there was no right to will the property away.  Bitter enmity\r\nremained between the families; they were always opposed in politics, and\r\ntheir animosity was fed by the belief which arose that at the\r\nanniversaries of her death the poor lady haunted the rooms, lamp in hand,\r\nwailing and lamenting.  A duel had been fought on the subject between the\r\nheirs of the two families, resulting in the death of the young Winslow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Ellen Fordyce, \xe2\x80\x98the feud is so beautifully ended; the\r\ndoom must be appeased, now that the head of one hostile line has come to\r\nthe rescue of the other, and saved all our lives.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy suggestion that these would hardly have been destroyed, even without\r\nour interposition, fell very flat, for romance must have its swing.\r\nEllen told us how, on the news of our kinsman\xe2\x80\x99s death and our\r\ninheritance, the ancestral story had been discussed, and her grandfather\r\nhad said he believed there were letters about it in the iron deed-box,\r\nand how he hoped to be on better terms with the new heir.\r\n\r\nThe ghost story had always been hushed up in the family, especially since\r\nthe duel, and we all knew the resemblance of the picture would be scouted\r\nby our elders; but perhaps this gave us the more pleasure in dwelling\r\nupon it, while we agreed that poor Margaret ought to be appeased by\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x99s prowess on behalf of the Fordyces.\r\n\r\nThe two young ladies went off to inspect the mullion chamber, which they\r\nfound so crammed with Hillside furniture that they could scarcely enter,\r\nand returned disappointed, except for having inspected and admired all\r\nGriff\xe2\x80\x99s weapons, especially what Miss Fordyce called the sword of her\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\nShe had been learning German\xe2\x80\x94rather an unusual study in those days, and\r\nshe narrated to us most effectively the story of _Die Weisse Frau_,\r\nworking herself up to such a pitch that she would have actually\r\nvolunteered to spend a night in the room, to see whether Margaret would\r\nhold any communication with a descendant, after the example of the White\r\nWoman and Lady Bertha, if there had been either fire or accommodation,\r\nand if the only entrance had not been through Griff\xe2\x80\x99s private\r\nsitting-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE WHITE FEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98The white doe\xe2\x80\x99s milk is not out of his mouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                    SCOTT.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE had come home free from all blots.  His summer holiday had been\r\nprevented by the illness of one of the other clerks, whose place, Mr.\r\nCastleford wrote, he had so well supplied that ere long he would be sure\r\nto earn his promotion.  That kind friend had several times taken him to\r\nspend a Sunday in the country, and, as we afterwards had reason to think,\r\nwould have taken more notice of him but for the rooted belief of Mr.\r\nFrith that it was a case of favouritism, and that piety and strictness\r\nwere assumed to throw dust in the eyes of his patron.\r\n\r\nSuch distrust had tended to render Clarence more reserved than ever, and\r\nit was quite by the accident of finding him studying one of Mrs.\r\nTrimmer\xe2\x80\x99s Manuals that I discovered that, at the request of his good\r\nRector, he had become a Sunday-school teacher, and was as much interested\r\nas the enthusiastic girls; but I was immediately forbidden to utter a\r\nword on the subject, even to Emily, lest she should tell any one.\r\n\r\nSuch reserve was no doubt an outcome of his natural timidity.  He had to\r\nbear a certain amount of scorn and derision among some of his\r\nfellow-clerks for the stricter habits and observances that could not be\r\nconcealed, and he dreaded any fresh revelation of them, partly because of\r\nthe cruel imputation of hypocrisy, partly because he feared the bringing\r\na scandal on religion by his weakness and failures.\r\n\r\nNor did our lady visitors\xe2\x80\x99 ways reassure him, though they meant to be\r\nkind.  They could not help being formal and stiff, not as they were with\r\nGriff and me.  The two gentlemen were thoroughly friendly and hearty;\r\nParson Frank could hardly have helped being so towards any one in the\r\nsame house with himself; and as to little Anne, she found in the\r\nnew-comer a carpenter and upholsterer superior even to Martyn; but her\r\ncandour revealed a great deal which I overheard one afternoon, when the\r\ntwo children were sitting together on the hearth-rug in the bookroom in\r\nthe twilight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I want to see Mr. Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s white feather,\xe2\x80\x99 observed Anne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Griff has a white plume in his Yeomanry helmet,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Martyn;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clarence hasn\xe2\x80\x99t one.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, I saw Mr. Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99 she answered; \xe2\x80\x98but Cousin Horace said Mr.\r\nClarence showed the white feather.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cousin Horace is an ape!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is so nice as an ape,\xe2\x80\x99 said Anne.  \xe2\x80\x98He is more like a\r\nmonkey.  He tries the dolls by court-martial, and he shot Arabella with a\r\npea-shooter, and broke her eye; only grandpapa made him have it put in\r\nagain with his own money, and then he said I was a little sneak, and if I\r\never did it again he would shoot me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Clarence what he said,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!  I think Mr. Clarence very nice indeed; but Horace did tease so\r\nabout that day when he carried poor Amos Bell home.  He said Ellen had\r\ngone and made friends with the worst of all the wicked Winslows, who had\r\nshown the white feather and disgraced his flag.  No; I know you are not\r\nwicked.  And Mr. Griff came all glittering, like Richard C\xc5\x93ur de Lion,\r\nand saved us all that night.  But Ellen cried to think what she had done,\r\nand mamma said it showed what it was to speak to a strange young man; and\r\nshe has never let Ellen and me go out of the grounds by ourselves since\r\nthat day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is a horrid shame,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Martyn, \xe2\x80\x98that a fellow can\xe2\x80\x99t get into a\r\nscrape without its being for ever cast up to him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_I_ like him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Anne.  \xe2\x80\x98He gave Mary Bell a nice pair of boots, and\r\nhe made a new pair of legs for poor old Arabella, and she can really sit\r\ndown!  Oh, he is _very_ nice; but\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94in an awful whisper\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98does he tell\r\nstories?  I mean fibs\xe2\x80\x94falsehoods.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who told you that?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mamma said it.  Ellen was telling them something about the picture of\r\nthe white-satin lady, and mamma said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if it is only that young man,\r\nno doubt it is a mere mystification;\xe2\x80\x9d and papa said, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor young fellow,\r\nhe seems very amiable and well disposed;\xe2\x80\x9d and mamma said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf he can\r\ninvent such a story it shows that Horace was right, and he is not to be\r\nbelieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  Then they stopped, but I asked Ellen who it was, and she said\r\nit was Mr. Clarence, and it was a sad thing for Emily and all of you to\r\nhave such a brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMartyn began to stammer with indignation, and I thought it time to\r\ninterfere; so I called the little maid, and gravely explained the facts,\r\nadding that poor Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s punishment had been terrible, but that he was\r\ndoing his best to make up for what was past; and that, as to anything he\r\nmight have told, though he might be mistaken, he never said anything\r\n_now_ but what he believed to be true.  She raised her brown eyes to mine\r\nfull of gravity, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I _do_ like him.\xe2\x80\x99  Moreover, I privately made\r\nMartyn understand that if he told her what had been said about the\r\nwhite-satin lady, he would never be forgiven; the others would be sure to\r\nfind it out, and it might shorten their stay.\r\n\r\nThat was a dreadful idea, for the presence of those two creatures, to say\r\nnothing of their parents, was an unspeakable charm and novelty to us all.\r\nWe all worshipped the elder, and the little one was like a new discovery\r\nand toy to us, who had never been used to such a presence.  She was not a\r\ncommonplace child; but even if she had been, she would have been as\r\ncharming a study as a kitten; and she had all the four of us at her feet,\r\nthough her mother was constantly protesting against our spoiling her, and\r\nreally kept up so much wholesome discipline that the little maid never\r\nexceeded the bounds of being charming to us.  After that explanation\r\nthere was the same sweet wistful gentleness in her manner towards\r\nClarence as she showed to me; while he, who never dreamt of such a child\r\nknowing his history was brighter and freer with her than with any one\r\nelse, played with her and Martyn, and could be heard laughing merrily\r\nwith them.  Perhaps her mother and sister did not fully like this, but\r\nthey could not interfere before our faces.  And Parson Frank was really\r\nkind to him; took him out walking when going to Hillside, and talked to\r\nhim so as to draw him out; certifying, perhaps, that he would do no harm,\r\nalthough, indeed, the family looked on dear good Frank as a sort of boy,\r\ntoo kind-hearted and genial for his approval to be worth as much as that\r\nof the more severe.\r\n\r\nThese were our only Christmas visitors, for the state of the country did\r\nnot invite Londoners; but we did not want them.  The suppression of\r\nClarence was the only flaw in a singularly happy time; and, after all I\r\nbelieve I felt the pity of it more than he did, who expected nothing, and\r\nwas accustomed to being in the background.\r\n\r\nFor instance, one afternoon in the course of one of the grave discussions\r\nthat used to grow up between Miss Fordyce, Emily, and me, over subjects\r\ntrite to the better-instructed younger generation, we got quite out of\r\nour shallow depths.  I think it was on the meaning of the \xe2\x80\x98Communion of\r\nSaints,\xe2\x80\x99 for the two girls were both reading in preparation for a\r\nConfirmation at Bristol, and Miss Fordyce knew more than we did on these\r\nsubjects.  All the time Clarence had sat in the window, carving a bit of\r\ndoll\xe2\x80\x99s furniture, and quite forgotten; but at night he showed me the\r\nexposition copied from _Pearson on the Creed_, a bit of Hooker, and\r\nextracts from one or two sermons.  I found these were notes written out\r\nin a blank book, which he had had in hand ever since his Confirmation\xe2\x80\x94his\r\nlogbook as he called it; but he would not hear of their being mentioned\r\neven to Emily, and only consented to hunt up the books on condition I\r\nwould not bring him forward as the finder.  It was of no use to urge that\r\nit was a deprivation to us all that he should not aid us with his more\r\nthorough knowledge and deeper thought.  \xe2\x80\x98He could not do so,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in\r\na quiet decisive manner; \xe2\x80\x98it was enough for him to watch and listen to\r\nMiss Fordyce, when she could forget his presence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe often did forget it in her eagerness.  She was by nature one of the\r\nmost ardent beings that I ever saw, yet with enthusiasm kept in check by\r\nthe self-control inculcated as a primary duty.  It would kindle in those\r\nwonderful light brown eyes, glow in the clear delicate cheek, quiver in\r\nthe voice even when the words were only half adequate to the feeling.\r\nShe was not what is now called gushing.  Oh, no! not in the least!  She\r\nwas too reticent and had too much dignity for anything of the kind.\r\nEmily had always been reckoned as our romantic young lady, and teased\r\naccordingly, but her enthusiasm beside Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s was\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98As moonlight is to sunlight, as water is to wine,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\na mere reflection of the tone of the period, compared with a real element\r\nin the character.  At least so my sister tells me, though at the time all\r\nthe difference I saw was that Miss Fordyce had the most originality, and\r\nunconsciously became the leader.  The bookroom was given up to us, and\r\nthere in the morning we drew, worked, read, copied and practised music,\r\nwrote out extracts, and delivered our youthful minds to one another on\r\nall imaginable topics from \xe2\x80\x98slea silk to predestination.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nReligious subjects occupied us more than might have been held likely.  A\r\nspirit of reflection and revival was silently working in many a heart.\r\nEvangelicalism had stirred old-fashioned orthodoxy, and we felt its\r\naction.  The _Christian Year_ was Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s guiding star\xe2\x80\x94as it was ours,\r\nnay, doubly so in proportion to the ardour of her nature.  Certain poems\r\nare dearer and more eloquent to me still, because the verses recall to me\r\nthe thrill of her sweet tones as she repeated them.  We were all very\r\nignorant alike of Church doctrine and history, but talking out and\r\ncomparing our discoveries and impressions was as useful as it was\r\npleasant to us.\r\n\r\nWhat the _Christian Year_ was in religion to us Scott was in history.  We\r\nread to verify or illustrate him, and we had little raving fits over his\r\ncharacters, and jokes founded on them.  Indeed, Ellen saw life almost\r\nthrough that medium; and the siege of Hillside, dispersed by the splendid\r\nprowess of Griffith, the champion with silver helm and flashing sword,\r\nwas precious to her as a renewal of the days of Ivanhoe or Damian de\r\nLacy.\r\n\r\nAs may be believed, these quiet mornings were those when that true knight\r\nwas employed in field sports or yeomanry duties, such as the state of the\r\ncountry called for.  When he was at home, all was fun and merriment and\r\nnoise\xe2\x80\x94walks and rides on fine days, battledore and shuttlecock on wet\r\nones, music, singing, paper games, giggling and making giggle, and\r\nsometimes dancing in the hall\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Frank Fordyce joining with all his\r\nheart and drollery in many of these, like the boy he was.\r\n\r\nI could play quadrilles and country dances, and now and then a\r\nreel\xe2\x80\x94nobody thought of waltzes\xe2\x80\x94and the three couples changed and\r\ncounterchanged partners.  Clarence had the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s foot, and did his\r\npart when needed; Emily generally fell to his share, and their silence\r\nand gravity contrasted with the mirth of the other pairs.  He knew very\r\nwell he was the _pis aller_ of the party, and only danced when Parson\r\nFrank was not dragged out, nothing loth, by his little daughter.  With\r\nMiss Fordyce, Clarence never had the chance of dancing; she was always\r\nclaimed by Griff, or pounced upon by Martyn.\r\n\r\nMiss Fordyce she always was to us in those days, and those pretty lips\r\nscrupulously \xe2\x80\x98Mistered\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Winslowed\xe2\x80\x99 us.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she would have\r\nbeen more to us, if we had called her Nell, and had been Griff, Bill, and\r\nTed to her, or if there had not been all the little formalities of\r\navoiding t\xc3\xaate \xc3\xa0 t\xc3\xaates and the like.  They were essentials of propriety\r\nthen\xe2\x80\x94natural, and never viewed as prudish.  Nor did it detract from the\r\nsweet dignity of maidenhood that there was none of the familiarity which\r\nbreeds something one would rather not mention in conjunction with a lady.\r\n\r\nAltogether there was a sunshine around Miss Fordyce by which we all\r\nseemed illuminated, even the least favoured and least demonstrative; we\r\nwere all her willing slaves, and thought her smile and thanks full\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Griff and Martyn were assisting at the turn out of an\r\nisolated barn at Hillside, where Frank Fordyce declared, all the\r\nburnt-out rats and mice had taken refuge, the young ladies went out to\r\ncater for house decorations for Christmas under Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s escort.\r\nNobody but the clerk ever thought of touching the church, where there\r\nwere holes in all the pews to receive the holly boughs.\r\n\r\nThe girls came back, telling in eager scared voices how, while gathering\r\nbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s broom in Farmer Hodges\xe2\x80\x99 home copse, a savage dog had flown out\r\nat them, but had been kept at bay by Mr. Clarence Winslow with an\r\numbrella, while they escaped over the stile.\r\n\r\nClarence had not come into the drawing-room with them, and while my\r\nmother, who had a great objection to people standing about in out-door\r\ngarments, sent them up to doff their bonnets and furs, I repaired to our\r\nroom, and was horrified to find him on my bed, white and faint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bitten?\xe2\x80\x99 I cried in dismay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes; but not much.  Only I\xe2\x80\x99m such a fool.  I turned off when I began\r\ntaking off my boots.  No, no\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t call any one.  It is nothing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe was springing up to stop me, but was forced to drop back, and I made\r\nmy way to the drawing-room, where my mother happened to be alone.  She\r\nwas much alarmed, but a glass of wine restored Clarence; and inspection\r\nshowed that the thick trowser and winter stocking had so protected him\r\nthat little blood had been drawn, and there was bruise rather than bite\r\nin the calf of the leg, where the brute had caught him as he was getting\r\nover the stile as the rear-guard.  It was painful, though the faintness\r\nwas chiefly from tension of nerve, for he had kept behind all the way\r\nhome, and no one had guessed at the hurt.  My mother doctored it\r\ntenderly, and he begged that nothing should be said about it; he wanted\r\nno fuss about such a trifle.  My mother agreed, with the proud feeling of\r\nnot enhancing the obligations of the Fordyce family; but she absolutely\r\nkissed Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s forehead as she bade him lie quiet till dinner-time.\r\n\r\nWe kept silence at table while the girls described the horrors of the\r\nmonster.  \xe2\x80\x98A tawny creature, with a hideous black muzzle,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Like a bad dream,\xe2\x80\x99 said Miss Fordyce.  The two fathers expressed their\r\nintention of remonstrating with the farmer, and Griff declared that it\r\nwould be lucky if he did not shoot it.  Miss Fordyce generously took its\r\npart, saying the poor dog was doing its duty, and Griff ejaculated, \xe2\x80\x98If I\r\nhad been there!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would not have dared to show its teeth, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, when\r\nthere was a good deal of banter.\r\n\r\nMy father, however, came at night with mamma to inspect the hurt and ask\r\ndetails, and he ended with, \xe2\x80\x98Well done, Clarence, boy; I am gratified to\r\nsee you are acquiring presence of mind, and can act like a man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence smiled when they were gone, saying, \xe2\x80\x98That would have been an\r\ninsult to any one else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEmily perceived that he had not come off unscathed, and was much\r\naggrieved at being bound to silence.  \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 she broke out, \xe2\x80\x98if the dog\r\ngoes mad, and Clarence has the hydrophobia, I suppose I may tell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98In that pleasing contingency,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence smiling.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see,\r\nEmily, it is the worst compliment you can pay me not to treat this as a\r\nmatter of course?\xe2\x80\x99  Still, he was the happier for not having failed.\r\nWhatever strengthened his self-respect and gave him trust in himself was\r\na stepping-stone.\r\n\r\nAs to rivalry or competition with Griff, the idea seemingly never crossed\r\nhis mind, and envy or jealousy were equally aloof from it.  One subject\r\nof thankfulness runs through these recollections\xe2\x80\x94namely, that nothing\r\nbroke the tie of strong affection between us three brothers.  Griffith\r\nmight figure as the \xe2\x80\x98vary parfite knight,\xe2\x80\x99 the St. George of the piece,\r\nglittering in the halo shed round him by the bright eyes of the rescued\r\ndamsel; while Clarence might drag himself along as the poor recreant to\r\nbe contemned and tolerated, and he would accept the position meekly as\r\nonly his desert, without a thought of bitterness.  Indeed, he himself\r\nseemed to have imbibed Nurse Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s original opinion, that his genuine\r\nlove for sacred things was a sort of impertinence and pretension in such\r\nas he\xe2\x80\x94a kind of hypocrisy even when they were the realities and helps to\r\nwhich he clung with all his heart.  Still, this depression was only shown\r\nby reserve, and troubled no one save myself, who knew him best guessed\r\nwhat was lost by his silence, and burned in spirit at seeing him merely\r\nendured as one unworthy.\r\n\r\nIn one of our varieties of Waverley discussions the crystal hardness and\r\ninexperienced intolerance of youth made Miss Fordyce declare that had she\r\nbeen Edith Plantagenet, she would never, never have forgiven Sir Kenneth.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could she, when he had forsaken the king\xe2\x80\x99s banner?  Unpardonable!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen came a sudden, awful silence, as she recollected her audience, and\r\nblushed crimson with the misery of perceiving where her random shaft had\r\nstruck, nor did either of us know what to say; but to our surprise it was\r\nClarence who first spoke to relieve the desperate embarrassment.  \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nforgiven quite the right word, when the offence was not personal?  I know\r\nthat such things can neither be repaired nor overlooked, and I think that\r\nis what Miss Fordyce meant.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Mr. Winslow,\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I quite\r\nmeant\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and then, as her eyes for one moment fell on his subdued face, she\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x98No, I said what I ought not.  If there is sorrow\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94her voice\r\ntrembled\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98and pardon above, no one below has any right to say\r\nunpardonable.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence bowed his head, and his lips framed, but he did not utter,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99  Emily nervously began reading aloud the page before her,\r\nfull of the jingling recurring rhymes about Sir Thomas of Kent; but I saw\r\nEllen surreptitiously wipe away a tear, and from that time she was more\r\nkind and friendly with Clarence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nVENI, VIDI, VICI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98None but the brave,\r\n    None but the brave,\r\n    None but the brave deserve the fair.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94_Song_.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS trees were not yet heard of beyond the Fatherland, and both the\r\nmothers held that Christmas parties were not good for little children,\r\nsince Mrs. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s strong common sense had arrived at the same\r\nconclusion as Mrs. Fordyce had derived from Hannah More and Richard\r\nLovell Edgeworth.  Besides, rick-burning and mobs were far too recent for\r\nour neighbours to venture out at night.\r\n\r\nBut as we were all resolved that little Anne should have a memorable\r\nChristmas at Chantry House, we begged an innocent, though iced cake, from\r\nthe cook, painted a set of characters ourselves, including all the dolls,\r\nand bespoke the presence of Frank Fordyce at a feast in the outer mullion\r\nroom\xe2\x80\x94Griff\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, of course.  The locality was chosen as allowing\r\nmore opportunity for high jinks than the bookroom, and also because the\r\nswords and pistols in trophy over the mantelpiece had a great fascination\r\nfor the two sisters, and to \xe2\x80\x98drink tea with Mr. Griffith\xe2\x80\x99 was always\r\nknown to be a great ambition of the little queen of the festival.  As to\r\nthe mullion chamber legends, they had nearly gone out of our heads,\r\nthough Clarence did once observe, \xe2\x80\x98You remember, it will be the 26th of\r\nDecember;\xe2\x80\x99 but we did not think this worthy of consideration, especially\r\nas Anne\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment, at its latest, could not last beyond nine\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock; and the ghostly performances\xe2\x80\x94now entirely laid to the account of\r\nthe departed stable-boy\xe2\x80\x94never began before eleven.\r\n\r\nNor did anything interfere with our merriment.  The fun of fifty years\r\nago must be intrinsically exquisite to bear being handed down to another\r\ngeneration, so I will attempt no repetition, though some of those Twelfth\r\nDay characters still remain, pasted into my diary.  We anticipated\r\nTwelfth Day because our guests meant to go to visit some other friends\r\nbefore the New Year, and we knew Anne would have no chance there of\r\nfulfilling her great ambition of drawing for king and queen.  These\r\nhome-made characters were really charming.  Mrs. Fordyce had done several\r\nof them, and she drew beautifully.  A little manipulation contrived that\r\nthe exquisite Oberon and Titania should fall to Martyn and Anne, for whom\r\ncrowns and robes had been prepared, worn by her majesty with complacent\r\ndignity, but barely tolerated by him!  The others took their chance.\r\nParson Frank was Tom Thumb, and convulsed us all the evening by acting as\r\nif no bigger than that worthy, keeping us so merry that even Clarence\r\nlaughed as I had never seen him laugh before.\r\n\r\nCock Robin and Jenny Wren\xe2\x80\x94the best drawn of all\xe2\x80\x94fell to Griff and Miss\r\nFordyce.  There was a suspicion of a tint of real carnation on her cheek,\r\nas, on his low, highly-delighted bow, she held up her impromptu fan of\r\nfolded paper; and drollery about currant wine and hopping upon twigs went\r\non more or less all the time, while somehow or other the beauteous glow\r\non her cheeks went on deepening, so that I never saw her look so pretty\r\nas when thus playing at Jenny Wren\xe2\x80\x99s coyness, though neither she nor\r\nGriff had passed the bounds of her gracious precise discretion.\r\n\r\nThe joyous evening ended at last.  With the stroke of nine, Jenny Wren\r\nbore away Queen Titania to put her to bed, for the servants were having\r\nan entertainment of their own downstairs for all the out-door retainers,\r\netc.  Oberon departed, after an interval sufficient to prove his own\r\ndignity and advanced age.  Emily went down to report the success of the\r\nevening to the elders in the drawing-room, but we lingered while Frank\r\nFordyce was telling good stories of Oxford life, and Griff capping them\r\nwith more recent ones.\r\n\r\nWe too broke up\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember how; but Clarence was to help me down\r\nthe stairs, and Mr. Fordyce, frowning with anxiety at the process, was\r\noffering assistance, while we had much rather he had gone out of the way;\r\nwhen suddenly, in the gallery round the hall giving access to the\r\nbedrooms, there dawned upon us the startled but scarcely displeased\r\nfigure of Jenny Wren in her white dress, not turning aside that blushing\r\nface, while Cock Robin was clasping her hand and pressing it to his lips.\r\nThe tap of my crutches warned them.  She flew back within her door and\r\nshut it; Griff strode rapidly on, caught hold of her father\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nexclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Sir, sir, I must speak to you!\xe2\x80\x99 and dragged him back into\r\nthe mullion room leaving Clarence and me to convey ourselves downstairs\r\nas best we might.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Our sister, our sweet sister!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe were immensely excited.  All the three of us were so far in love with\r\nEllen Fordyce that her presence was an enchantment to us, and at any rate\r\nnone of us ever saw the woman we could compare to her; and as we both\r\nfelt ourselves disqualified in different ways from any nearer approach,\r\nwe were content to bask in the reflected rays of our brother\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\r\n\r\nNot that he had gone that length as yet, as we knew before the night was\r\nover, when he came down to us.  Even with the dear maiden herself, he had\r\nonly made sure that she was not averse, and that merely by her eyes and\r\nlips; and he had extracted nothing from her father but that they were\r\nboth very young, a great deal too young, and had no business to think of\r\nsuch things yet.  It must be talked over, etc. etc.\r\n\r\nBut just then, Griff told us, Frank Fordyce jumped up and turned round\r\nwith the sudden exclamation, \xe2\x80\x98Ellen!\xe2\x80\x99 looking towards the door behind him\r\nwith blank astonishment, as he found it had neither been opened nor shut.\r\nHe thought his daughter had recollected something left behind, and coming\r\nin search of it, had retreated precipitately.  He had seen her, he said,\r\nin the mirror opposite.  Griff told him there was no mirror, and had to\r\ncarry a candle across to convince him that he had only been looking at\r\nthe door into the inner room, which though of shining dark oak, could\r\nhardly have made a reflection as vivid as he declared that his had been.\r\nIndeed, he ascertained that Ellen had never left her own room at all.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It must have been thinking about the dear child,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.  \xe2\x80\x98And after\r\nall, it was not quite like her\xe2\x80\x94somehow\xe2\x80\x94she was paler, and had something\r\nover her head.\xe2\x80\x99  We had no doubt who it was.  Griff had not seen her, but\r\nhe was certain that there had been none of the moaning nor crying, \xe2\x80\x98In\r\nfact, she has come to give her consent,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with earnest in his\r\nmocking tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence gravely, and with glistening eyes.  \xe2\x80\x98You are happy\r\nGriff.  It is given to you to right the wrong, and quiet that poor\r\nspirit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Happy!  The happiest fellow in the world,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff, \xe2\x80\x98even without\r\nthat latter clause\xe2\x80\x94if only Madam and the old man will have as much sense\r\nas she has!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe next day was a thoroughly uncomfortable one.  Griff was not half so\r\nnear his goal as he had hoped last night when with kindly Parson Frank.\r\n\r\nThe commotion was as if a thunderbolt had descended among the elders.\r\nWhat they had been thinking of, I cannot tell, not to have perceived how\r\nmatters were tending; but their minds were full of the Reform Bill and\r\nthe state of the country, and, besides, we were all looked on still as\r\nmere children.  Indeed, Griff was scarcely one-and-twenty, and Ellen\r\nwanted a month of seventeen; and the crisis had really been a sudden\r\nimpulse, as he said, \xe2\x80\x98She looked so sweet and lovely, he could not help\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe first effect was a serious lecture upon maidenliness and propriety to\r\npoor Ellen from her mother, who was sure that she must have transgressed\r\nthe bounds of discretion, or such ill-bred presumption would have been\r\nspared her, and bitterly regretted the having trusted her to take care of\r\nherself.  There were sufficient grains of truth in this to make the poor\r\ngirl cry herself out of all condition for appearing at breakfast or\r\nluncheon, and Emily\xe2\x80\x99s report of her despair made us much more angry with\r\nMrs. Fordyce than was perhaps quite due to that good lady.\r\n\r\nMy parents were at first inclined to take the same line, and be vexed\r\nwith Griff for an act of impertinence towards a guest.  He had a great\r\ndeal of difficulty in inducing the elders to believe him in earnest, or\r\ntreat him as a man capable of knowing his own mind; and even thus they\r\nfelt as if his addresses to Miss Fordyce were, under present\r\ncircumstances, taking almost an unfair advantage of the other family\xe2\x80\x94at\r\nwhich our youthful spirits felt indignant.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, such a match was as obvious and suitable as if it had\r\nbeen a family compact, and the only objection was the youth of the\r\nparties.  Mrs. Fordyce would fain have believed her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart to\r\nbe not yet awake, and was grieved to find childhood over, and the hero of\r\nromance become the lover; and she was anxious that full time should be\r\ngiven to perceive whether her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s feelings were only the result of\r\nthe dazzling aureole which gratitude and excited fancy had cast around\r\nthe fine, handsome, winning youth.  Her husband, however, who had himself\r\nmarried very young, and was greatly taken with Griff, besides being\r\nalways tender-hearted, did not enter into her scruples; but, as we had\r\nalready found out, the grand-looking and clever man of thirty-eight was,\r\nchiefly from his impulsiveness and good-nature, treated as the boy of the\r\nfamily.  His old father, too, was greatly pleased with Griff\xe2\x80\x99s spirit,\r\naffection, and purpose, as well as with my father\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in the\r\nmatter; and so, after a succession of private interviews, very\r\ntantalising to us poor outsiders, it was conceded that though an\r\nengagement for the present was preposterous, it might possibly be\r\npermitted when Ellen was eighteen if Griff had completed his university\r\nlife with full credit.  He was fervently grateful to have such an object\r\nset before him, and my father was warmly thankful for the stimulus.\r\n\r\nThat last evening was very odd and constrained.  We could not help\r\nlooking on the lovers as new specimens over which some strange\r\ntransformation had passed, though for the present it had stiffened them\r\nin public into the strictest good behaviour.  They would have been\r\nawkward if it had been possible to either of them, and, save for a\r\ncertain look in their eyes, comported themselves as perfect strangers.\r\n\r\nThe three elder gentlemen held discussions in the dining-room, but we\r\nwere not trusted in our playground adjoining.  Mrs. Fordyce nailed Griff\r\ndown to an interminable game at chess, and my mother kept the two girls\r\nplaying duets, while Clarence turned over the leaves; and I read over\r\n_The Lady of the Lake_, a study which I always felt, and still feel, as\r\nan act of homage to Ellen Fordyce, though there was not much in common\r\nbetween her and the maid of Douglas.  Indeed, it was a joke of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s to tease her by criticising the famous passage about the tears\r\nthat old Douglas shed over his duteous daughter\xe2\x80\x99s head\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98What in the world\r\nshould the man go whining and crying for?  He had much better have\r\nlaughed with her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLittle did the elders know what was going on in the next room, where\r\nthere was a grand courtship among the dolls; the hero being a small\r\njointed Dutch one in Swiss costume, about an eighth part of the size of\r\nthe resuscitated Celestina Mary, but the only available male character in\r\ndoll-land!  Anne was supposed to be completely ignorant of what passed\r\nabove her head; and her mother would have been aghast had she heard the\r\nremarkable discoveries and speculations that she and Martyn communicated\r\nto one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nTHE OUTSIDE OF THE COURTSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Or framing, as a fair excuse,\r\n    The book, the pencil, or the muse;\r\n    Something to give, to sing, to say,\r\n    Some modern tale, some ancient lay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                    SCOTT.\r\n\r\nIT seems to me on looking back that I have hardly done justice to Mrs.\r\nFordyce, and certainly we\xe2\x80\x94as Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s eager partisans\xe2\x80\x94often regarded\r\nher in the light of an enemy and opponent; but after this lapse of time,\r\nI can see that she was no more than a prudent mother, unwilling to see\r\nher fair young daughter suddenly launched into womanhood, and involved in\r\nan attachment to a young and untried man.\r\n\r\nThe part of a drag is an invidious one; and this must have been her part\r\nthrough most of her life.  The Fordyces, father and son, were of good\r\nfamily, gentlemen to their very backbones, and thoroughly good, religious\r\nmen; but she came of a more aristocratic strain, had been in London\r\nsociety, and brought with her a high-bred air which, implanted on the\r\nFordyce good looks, made her daughter especially fascinating.  But that\r\nair did not recommend Mrs. Fordyce to all her neighbours, any more than\r\ndid those stronger, stricter, more thorough-going notions of religious\r\nobligation which had led her husband to make the very real and painful\r\nsacrifice of his sporting tastes, and attend to the parish in a manner\r\nonly too rare in those days.  She was a very well-informed and highly\r\naccomplished woman, and had made her daughter the same, keeping her\r\nchildren up in a somewhat exclusive style, away from all gossip or\r\nundesirable intimacies, as recommended by Miss Edgeworth and other more\r\nreligious authorities, and which gave great offence in houses where there\r\nwere girls of the same age.  No one, however, could look at Ellen, and\r\ndoubt of the success of the system, or of the young girl\xe2\x80\x99s entire content\r\nand perfect affection for her mother, though her father was her beloved\r\nplayfellow\xe2\x80\x94yet always with respect.  She never took liberties with him,\r\nnor called him Pap or any other ridiculous name inconsistent with the\r\nfifth Commandment, though she certainly was more entirely at ease with\r\nhim than ever we had been with our elderly father.  When once Mrs.\r\nFordyce found on what terms we were to be, she accepted them frankly and\r\nfully.  Already Emily had been the first girl, not a relation, whose\r\nfriendship she had fostered with Ellen; and she had also become\r\nthoroughly affectionate and at home with my mother, who suited her\r\nperfectly on the conscientious, and likewise on the prudent and sensible,\r\nside of her nature.\r\n\r\nTo me she was always kindness itself, so kind that I never felt, as I did\r\non so many occasions, that she was very pitiful and attentive to the\r\ndeformed youth; but that she really enjoyed my companionship, and I could\r\nhelp her in her pursuits.  I have a whole packet of charming notes of\r\nhers about books, botany, drawings, little bits of antiquarianism,\r\nwritten with an arch grace and finish of expression peculiarly her own,\r\nand in a very pointed hand, yet too definite to be illegible.  I owe her\r\nmore than I can say for the windows of wholesome hope and ambition she\r\nopened to me, giving a fresh motive and zest even to such a life as mine.\r\nI can hardly tell which was the most delightful companion, she or her\r\nhusband.  In spite of ill health, she knew every plant, and every bit of\r\nfair scenery in the neighbourhood, and had fresh, amusing criticisms to\r\nutter on each new book; while he, not neglecting the books, was equally\r\nwell acquainted with all beasts and birds, and shed his kindly light over\r\neverything he approached.  He was never melancholy about anything but\r\npolitics, and even there it was an immense consolation to him to have the\r\nowner of Chantry House staunch on the same side, instead of in chronic\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThe family party moved to a tall house at Bath, but there still was close\r\nintercourse, for the younger clergyman rode over every week for the\r\nSunday duty, and almost always dined and slept at Chantry House.  He\r\nacted as bearer of long letters, which, in spite of a reticulation of\r\ncrossings, were too expensive by post for young ladies\xe2\x80\x99 pocket-money,\r\noften exceeding the regular quarto sheet.  It was a favourite joke to ask\r\nEmily what Ellen reported about Bath fashions, and to see her look of\r\nscorn.  For they were a curious mixture, those girlish letters, of\r\nvillage interests, discussion of books, and thoughts beyond their age;\r\nTommy Toogood and Prometheus; or Du Guesclin in the closest juxtaposition\r\nwith reports of progress in Abercrombie on the _Intellectual Powers_.  It\r\nwas the desire of Ellen to prove herself not unsettled but improved by\r\nlove, and to become worthy of her ideal Griffith, never guessing that he\r\nwould have been equally content with her if she had been as frivolous as\r\nthe idlest girl who lingered amid the waning glories of Bath.\r\n\r\nWe all made them a visit there when Martyn was taken to a preparatory\r\nschool in the place.  Mrs. Fordyce took me out for drives on the\r\nbeautiful hills; and Emily and I had a very delightful time, undisturbed\r\nby the engrossing claims of love-making.  Very good, too, were our\r\nfriends, after our departure, in letting Martyn spend Sundays and\r\nholidays with them, play with Anne as before, say his Catechism with her\r\nto Mrs. Fordyce, and share her little Sunday lessons, which had, he has\r\nsince told, a force and attractiveness he had never known before, and\r\nreally did much, young as he was, in preparing the way towards the\r\nfulfilment of my father\xe2\x80\x99s design for him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rectory was ready, and the family returned, it was high summer,\r\nand there were constant meetings between the households.  No doubt there\r\nwere the usual amount of trivial disappointments and annoyances, but the\r\nwhole season seems to me to have been bathed in sunlight.  The Reform\r\nBill agitations and the London mobs of which Clarence wrote to us were\r\nlike waves surging beyond an isle of peace.  Clarence had some unpleasant\r\nwalks from the office.  Once or twice the shutters had to be put up at\r\nFrith and Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s to prevent the windows from being broken; and once\r\nClarence actually saw our nation\xe2\x80\x99s hero, \xe2\x80\x98the Duke,\xe2\x80\x99 riding quietly and\r\nslowly through a yelling, furious mob, who seemed withheld from falling\r\non him by the perfect impassiveness of the eagle face and spare figure.\r\nMoreover a pretty little boy, on his pony, suddenly pushed forward and\r\nrode by the Duke\xe2\x80\x99s side, as if proud and resolute to share his peril.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If Griffith had been there!\xe2\x80\x99 said Ellen and Emily, though they did not\r\nexactly know what they expected him to have done.\r\n\r\nThe chief storms that drifted across our sky were caused by Mrs.\r\nFordyce\xe2\x80\x99s resolution that Griffith should enjoy none of the privileges of\r\nan accepted suitor before the engagement was an actual fact.  Ellen was\r\nobedient and conscientious; and would neither transgress nor endure to\r\nhave her mother railed at by Griff\xe2\x80\x99s hasty tongue, and this affronted\r\nhim, and led to little breezes.\r\n\r\nWhen people overstay their usual time, tempers are apt to get rather\r\ndifficult.  Griffith had kept all his terms at Oxford, and was not to\r\nreturn thither after the long vacation, but was to read with a tutor\r\nbefore taking his degree.  Moreover bills began to come from Oxford, not\r\nvery serious, but vexing my father and raising annoyances and frets, for\r\nGriff resented their being complained of, and thought himself ill-used,\r\ngoing off to see his own friends whenever he was put out.\r\n\r\nOne morning at breakfast, late in October, he announced that Lady Peacock\r\nwas in lodgings at Clifton, and asked my mother to call on her.  But\r\nmamma said it was too far for the horse\xe2\x80\x94she visited no one at that\r\ndistance, and had never thought much of Selina Clarkson before or after\r\nher marriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But now that she is a widow, it would be such a kindness,\xe2\x80\x99 pleaded\r\nGriff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Depend upon it, a gay young widow needs no kindness from me, and had\r\nbetter not have it from you,\xe2\x80\x99 said my mother, getting up from behind her\r\nurn and walking off, followed by my father.\r\n\r\nGriff drummed on the table.  \xe2\x80\x98I wonder what good ladies of a certain age\r\ndo with their charity,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\r\nAnd while we were still crying out at him, Ellen Fordyce and her father\r\nappeared, like mirth bidding good-morrow, at the window.  All was well\r\nfor the time, but Griff wanted Ellen to set out alone with him, and take\r\ntheir leisurely way through the wood-path, and she insisted on waiting\r\nfor her father, who had got into an endless discussion with mine on the\r\nReform Bill, thrown out in the last Session.  Griff tried to wile her on\r\nwith him, but, though she consented to wander about the lawn before the\r\nwindows with him, she always resolutely turned at the great beech tree.\r\nEmily and I watched them from the window, at first amused, then vexed, as\r\nwe could see, by his gestures, that he was getting out of temper, and her\r\nstraw bonnet drooped at one moment, and was raised the next in eager\r\nremonstrance or defence.  At last he flung angrily away from her, and\r\nwent off to the stables, leaving her leaning against the gate in tears.\r\nEmily, in an access of indignant sympathy, rushed out to her, and they\r\nvanished together into the summer-house, until her father called her, and\r\nthey went home together.\r\n\r\nEmily told me that Ellen had struggled hard to keep herself from crying\r\nenough to show traces of tears which her father could observe, and that\r\nshe had excused Griff with all her might on the plea of her own\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tiresomeness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe were all the more angry with him for his selfishness and want of\r\nconsideration, for Ellen, in her torrent of grief, had even disclosed\r\nthat he had said she did not care for him\xe2\x80\x94no one really in love ever\r\nscrupled about a mother\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nWe were resolved, like two sages, to give him a piece of our minds, and\r\nconvince him that such dutifulness was the pledge of future happiness,\r\nand that it was absolute cruelty to the rare creature he had won, to try\r\nto draw her in a direction contrary to her conscience.\r\n\r\nHowever, we saw him no more that day; and only learnt that he had left a\r\nmessage at the stables that dinner was not to be kept waiting for him.\r\nSuch a message from Clarence would have caused a great commotion; but it\r\nwas quite natural and a matter of course from him in the eyes of the\r\nelders, who knew nothing of his parting with Ellen.  However, there was\r\nannoyance enough, when bedtime came, family prayers were over, and still\r\nthere was no sign of him.  My father sat up till one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, to let him\r\nin, then gave it up, and I heard his step heavily mounting the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nBRISTOL DIAMONDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98_Stafford_.  And you that are the King\xe2\x80\x99s friends, follow me.\r\n\r\n    _Cade_.  And you that love the Commons, follow me;\r\n    We will not leave one lord, one gentleman,\r\n    Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                       Act I.  _Henry VI_.\r\n\r\nTHE next day was Sunday, and no Griff appeared in the morning.  Vexation,\r\nperhaps, prevented us from attending as much as we otherwise might have\r\ndone to Mr. Henderson when he told us that there were rumours of a\r\nserious disturbance at Bristol; until Emily recollected that Griff had\r\nbeen talking for some days past of riding over to see his friend in the\r\ncavalry regiment there stationed, and we all agreed that it was most\r\nlikely that he was there; and our wrath began to soften in the belief\r\nthat he might have been detained to give his aid in the cause of order,\r\nthough his single arm could not be expected to effect as much as at\r\nHillside.\r\n\r\nLong after dark we heard a horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and in another minute Griff,\r\nsinged, splashed, and battered, had hurried into the room\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98It has begun!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said.  \xe2\x80\x98The revolution!  I have brought her\xe2\x80\x94Lady Peacock.  She was at\r\nClifton, dreadfully alarmed.  She is almost at the door now, in her\r\ncarriage.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take the pony, and ride over to tell Eastwood in\r\ncase he will call out the Yeomanry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wheels were to be heard, and everybody hastened out to receive Lady\r\nPeacock, who was there with her maid, full of gratitude.  I heard her\r\nbroken sentences as she came across the hall, about dreadful\r\nscenes\xe2\x80\x94frightful mob\xe2\x80\x94she knew not what would have become of her but for\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x94the place was in flames when they left it\xe2\x80\x94the military would not\r\nact\xe2\x80\x94Griffith had assured her that Mr. and Mrs. Winslow would be so\r\nkind\xe2\x80\x94as long as any place was a refuge\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nWe really did believe we were at the outbreak of a revolution or civil\r\nwar, and, all little frets forgotten, listened appalled to the tidings;\r\nhow the appearance of Sir Charles Wetherall, the Recorder of Bristol, a\r\nstrong opponent to the Reform Bill, seemed to have inspired the mob with\r\nfury.  Griff and his friend the dragoon, while walking in Broad Street,\r\nwere astonished by a violent rush of riotous men and boys, hooting and\r\nthrowing stones as the Recorder\xe2\x80\x99s carriage tried to make its way to the\r\nGuildhall.  In the midst a piteous voice exclaimed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, Griffith!  Mr. Griffith Winslow!  Is it you?\xe2\x80\x99 and Lady Peacock was\r\nseen retreating upon the stone steps of a house either empty, or where\r\nthe inhabitants were too much alarmed to open the doors.  She was\r\nterribly frightened, and the two gentlemen stood in front of her till the\r\ntumultuary procession had passed by.  She was staying in lodgings at\r\nClifton, and had driven in to Bristol to shop, when she thus found\r\nherself entangled in the mob.  They then escorted her to the place where\r\nshe was to meet her carriage, and found it for her with some difficulty.\r\nThen, while the officer returned to his quarters, Griff accompanied her\r\nfar enough on the way to Clifton to see that everything was quiet before\r\nher, and then returned to seek out his friend.  The court at the\r\nGuildhall had had to be adjourned, but the rioters were hunting Sir\r\nCharles to the Mansion-House.  Griff was met by one of the Town Council,\r\na tradesman with whom we dealt, who, having perhaps heard of his prowess\r\nat Hillside, entreated him to remain, offering him a bed, and saying that\r\nall friends of order were needed in such a crisis as this.  Griff wrote a\r\nnote to let us know what had become of him, but everything was\r\ndisorganised, and we did not get it till two days afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the mob became more violent, and in the midst of dinner a\r\nsummons came for Griff\xe2\x80\x99s host to attend the Mayor in endeavouring to\r\ndisperse it.  Getting into the Mansion-House by private back ways, they\r\nwere able to join the Mayor when he came out, amid a shower of brickbats,\r\nsticks, and stones, and read the Riot Act three times over, after warning\r\nthem of the consequences of persisting in their defiance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But they were far past caring for that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff.  \xe2\x80\x98An iron rail from\r\nthe square was thrown in the midst of it, and if I had not caught it\r\nthere would have been an end of his Worship.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe constables, with such help as Griff and a few others could give them,\r\ndefended the front of the Mansion-House, while the Recorder, for whom\r\nthey savagely roared, made his escape by the roof to another house.  A\r\nbarricade was made with beds, tables, and chairs, behind which the\r\ndefenders sheltered themselves, while volleys of stones smashed in the\r\nwindows, and straw was thrown after them.  But at last the tramp of\r\nhorses\xe2\x80\x99 feet was heard, and the Dragoons came up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We thought all over then,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff; \xe2\x80\x98but Colonel Brereton would not\r\nhave a blow struck, far less a shot fired!  He would have it that it was\r\na good-humoured mob!  I heard him!  When one of his own men was brought\r\nup badly hurt with a brickbat, I heard Ludlow, the Town-Clerk, ask him\r\nwhat he thought of their good humour, and he had nothing to say but that\r\nit was an accident!  And the rogues knew it!  He took care they should;\r\nhe walked about among them and shook hands with them!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGriff waited at the Mansion-House all night, and helped to board up the\r\nsmashed windows; but at daylight Colonel Brereton came and insisted on\r\nwithdrawing the piquet on guard\xe2\x80\x94not, however, sending a relief for them,\r\non the plea that they only collected a crowd.  The instant they were\r\nwithdrawn, down came the mob in fresh force, so desperate that all the\r\ndefences were torn down, and they swarmed in so that there was nothing\r\nfor it but to escape over the roofs.\r\n\r\nGriffith was sent to rouse the inhabitants of College Green and St.\r\nAugustine\xe2\x80\x99s Back to come in the King\xe2\x80\x99s name to assist the Magistrates,\r\nand he had many good stories of the various responses he met with.  But\r\nthe rioters, inflamed by the wine they had found in sacking the\r\nMansion-House, and encouraged by the passiveness of the troops, had\r\nbecome entirely masters of the situation.  And Colonel Brereton seems to\r\nhave imagined that the presence of the soldiers acted as an irritation;\r\nfor in this crisis he actually sent them out of the city to Keynsham,\r\nthen came and informed the mob, who cheered him, as well they might.\r\n\r\nIn the night the Recorder had left the city, and notices were posted to\r\nthat effect; also that the Riot Act had been read, and any further\r\ndisturbance would be capital felony.  This escape of their victim only\r\nhad the effect of directing the rage of the populace against Bishop Grey,\r\nwho had likewise opposed the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nMessages had been sent to advise the Bishop, who was to preach that day\r\nat the Cathedral, to stay away and sanction the omission of the service;\r\nbut his answer to one of his clergy was\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98These are times in which it is\r\nnecessary not to shrink from danger!  Our duty is to be at our post.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd he also said, \xe2\x80\x98Where can I die better than in my own Cathedral?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSince the bells were ringing, and it was understood that the Bishop was\r\nactually going to dare the peril, Griff and others of the defenders\r\ndecided that it was better to attend the service and fill up the nave so\r\nas to hinder outrage.  He said it was a most strange and wonderful\r\nservice.  Chants and Psalms and Lessons and prayers going on their course\r\nas usual, but every now and then in the pauses of the organ, a howl or\r\nyell of the voice of the multitude would break on the ear through the\r\nthick walls.  Griff listened and hoped for a volley of musketry.  He was\r\nnot tender-hearted!  But none came, and by the time the service was over,\r\nthe mob had been greatly reinforced and had broken into the prisons, set\r\nthem on fire, and released the prisoners.  They were mustering on College\r\nGreen for an attack on the palace.  Griff aided in guarding the entrance\r\nto the cloisters till the Bishop and his family had had time to drive\r\naway to Almondsbury, four miles off, and then the rush became so strong\r\nthat they had to give way.  There was another great struggle at the door\r\nof the palace, but it was forced open with a crowbar, while shouts rang\r\nout \xe2\x80\x98No King and no Bishops!\xe2\x80\x99  A fire was made in the dining-room with\r\nchairs and tables, and live coals were put into the beds, while the\r\nplunder went on.\r\n\r\nGriff meantime had made his way to the party headed by the magistrates,\r\nand accompanied by the dragoons, and the mob began to flee; but Colonel\r\nBrereton had given strict orders that the soldiers should not fire, and\r\nthe plunderers rallied, made a fire in the Chapter House, and burnt the\r\nwhole of the library, shouting with the maddest triumph.\r\n\r\nThey next attacked the Cathedral, intending to burn that likewise, but\r\ntwo brave gentlemen, Mr. Ralph and Mr. Linne, succeeded in saving this\r\nlast outrage, at the head of the better affected.\r\n\r\nGriff had fought hard.  He was all over bruises which he really had never\r\nfelt at the time, scarcely even now, though one side of his face was\r\nturning purple, and his clothes were singed.  In a sort of council held\r\nat the repulse of the attack on the Cathedral, it had been decided that\r\nthe best thing he could do would be to give notice to Sir George\r\nEastwood, in order that the Yeomanry might be called out, since the\r\ntroops were so strangely prevented from acting.  As he rode through\r\nClifton, he had halted at Lady Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s, and found her in extreme alarm.\r\nIndeed, no one could guess what the temper of the mob might be the next\r\nday, or whether they might not fall upon private houses.  The\r\nMansion-House, the prisons, the palace were all burning and were an\r\nastounding sight, which terrified her exceedingly, and she was sending\r\nout right and left to endeavour to get horses to take her away.  In\r\ncommon humanity, and for old acquaintance sake, it was impossible not to\r\nhelp her, and Griff had delayed, to offer any amount of reward in her\r\nname for posthorses, which he had at last secured.  Her own man-servant,\r\nwhom she had sent in quest of some, had never returned, and she had to\r\nset off without him, Griff acting as outrider; but after the first there\r\nwas no more difficulty about horses, and she had been able to change them\r\nat the next stage.\r\n\r\nWe all thought the days of civil war were really begun, as the heads of\r\nthis account were hastily gathered; but there was not much said, only Mr.\r\nFrank Fordyce laid his hand on Griff\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and said, \xe2\x80\x98Well done, my\r\nboy; but you have had enough for to-day.  If you\xe2\x80\x99ll lend me a horse,\r\nWinslow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ride over to Eastwood.  That\xe2\x80\x99s work for the clergy in these\r\ntimes, eh?  Griffith should rest.  He may be wanted to-morrow.  Only is\r\nthere any one to take a note home for me, to say where I\xe2\x80\x99m gone;\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nthen he added with that sweet smile of his, \xe2\x80\x98Some one will be more the\r\ntrue knight than ever, eh, you Griffith you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGriffith coloured a little, and Lady Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looked interrogative.\r\nWhen the horse was announced, Griff followed Mr. Fordyce into the hall,\r\nand came back announcing that, unless summoned elsewhere, he should go to\r\nbreakfast at Hillside, and so hear what was decided on.  He longed to be\r\nback at the scene of action, but was so tired out that he could not\r\ndispense with another night\xe2\x80\x99s rest; though he took all precautions for\r\nbeing called up, in case of need.\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing came, and he rode to the Rectory in Yeomanry equipment.\r\nNor could any one doubt that in the ecstasy of meeting such a hero, all\r\nthe little misunderstanding and grief of the night before was forgotten?\r\nEllen looked as if she trod on air, when she came down with her father to\r\nreport that Griffith had gone, according to the orders sent, to join the\r\nrest of the Yeomanry, who were to advance upon Bristol.  They had seen,\r\nand tried to turn back, some of the villagers who were starting with\r\nbludgeons to share in the spoil, and who looked sullen, as if they were\r\ndetermined not to miss their share.\r\n\r\nI do not think we were very much alarmed for Griff\xe2\x80\x99s safety or for our\r\nown, not even the ladies.  My mother had the lion-heart of her naval\r\nancestors, and Ellen was in a state of exaltation.  Would that I could\r\nput her before other eyes, as she stood with hands clasped and glowing\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x94think!\xe2\x80\x94think of having one among us who is as real and true knight\r\nas ever watched his armour\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n                   \xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9cFor king, for church, for lady fight!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt has all come gloriously true!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Should not you like to bind on his spurs?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked somewhat\r\nmischievously; but she was serious as she said, \xe2\x80\x98I am sure he has won\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99  All the rest of the Fordyces came down afterwards, too anxious to\r\nstay at home.  Our elders felt the matter more gravely, thinking of what\r\ncivil war might mean to us all, and what an awful thing it was for\r\nEnglishmen to be enrolled against each other.  Nottingham Castle had just\r\nbeen burnt, and things looked only too like revolution, especially\r\nconsidering the inaction of the dragoons.  After Griff had left Bristol,\r\nthere had been some terrible scenes at the Custom House, where the\r\nringleaders\xe2\x80\x94unhappy men!\xe2\x80\x94were caught in a trap of their own and perished\r\nmiserably.\r\n\r\nHowever, by the morning, the order sent from Lord Hill, the arrival of\r\nMajor Beckwith from Gloucester, and the proceedings of the good-humoured\r\nmob had put an end to poor Brereton\xe2\x80\x99s hesitations; a determined front had\r\nbeen shown; the mob had been fairly broken up; troops from all quarters\r\npoured into the city, and by dinner-time Griff came back with the news\r\nthat all was quiet and there was nothing more to fear.  Ellen and Emily\r\nboth flew out to meet him at the first sound of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and\r\nthey all came into the drawing-room together\xe2\x80\x94each young lady having hold\r\nof one of his hands\xe2\x80\x94and Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s face in such a glow, that I rather\r\nsuspect that he had snatched a reward which certainly would not have been\r\ngranted save in such a moment of uplifted feeling, and when she was\r\nthankful to her hero for forgetting how angry he had been with her two\r\ndays before.\r\n\r\nMinor matters were forgotten in the details of his tidings, as he stood\r\nbefore the fire, shining in his silver lace, and relating the tragedy and\r\nthe comedy of the scene.\r\n\r\nIt was curious, as the evening passed on, to see how Ellen and Lady\r\nPeacock regarded each other, now that the tension of suspense was over.\r\nTo Ellen, the guest was primarily a distressed and widowed dame,\r\ndelivered by Griff, to whom she, as his lady love, was bound to be\r\ngracious and kind; nor had they seen much of one another, the elder\r\nladies sitting in the drawing-room, and we in our own regions; but we\r\nwere all together at dinner and afterwards, and Lady Peacock, who had\r\nbeen in a very limp, nervous, and terrified state all day, began to be\r\nthe Selina Clarkson we remembered, and \xe2\x80\x98more too.\xe2\x80\x99  She was still in\r\nmourning, but she came down to dinner in gray satin sheen, and with her\r\nhair in a most astonishing erection of bows and bands, on the very crown\r\nof her head, raising her height at least four inches.  Emily assures me\r\nthat it was the mode in use, and that she and Ellen wore their hair in\r\nthe same style, appealing to portraits to prove it.  I can only say that\r\nthey never astonished my weak mind in the like manner; and that their\r\nheads, however dressed, only appeared to me a portion of the general\r\nwoman, and part of the universal fitness of things.  Ellen was likewise\r\namazed, most likely not at the hair, but at the transformation of the\r\ndisconsolate, frightened widow, into the handsome, fashionable, stylish\r\nlady, talking over London acquaintance and London news with my father and\r\nGriff whenever they left the endless subject of the Bristol adventures.\r\n\r\nThe widow had gained a good deal in beauty since her early girlhood,\r\nhaving regular features, eyes of an uncommon deep blue, very black brows,\r\neye-lashes, and hair, and a form of the kind that is better after early\r\nyouth is over.  \xe2\x80\x98A fine figure of a woman,\xe2\x80\x99 Parson Frank pronounced her,\r\nand his wife, with the fine edge of her lips replied, \xe2\x80\x98exactly what she\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe looked upon us younger ones as mere children still\xe2\x80\x94indeed she never\r\nlooked at me at all if she could help it\xe2\x80\x94but she mortally offended Emily\r\nby penning her up in a corner, and asking if Griff were engaged to that\r\nsentimental little girl.\r\n\r\nEmily coloured like a turkey cock between wrath and embarrassment, and\r\nhotly protested against the word sentimental.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah yes, I see!\xe2\x80\x99 she said in a patronising tone, \xe2\x80\x98she is your bosom\r\nfriend, eh?  That\xe2\x80\x99s the way those things always begin.  You need not\r\nanswer: I see it all.  And no doubt it is a capital thing for him;\r\nproperties joining and all.  And she will get a little air and style when\r\nhe takes her to London.\xe2\x80\x99  It was a tremendous offence even to hint that\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s style was capable of improvement; perhaps an unprejudiced eye\r\nwould have said that the difference was between high-bred simplicity and\r\nthe air of fashion and society.\r\n\r\nIn our eyes Lady Peacock was the companion of the elders, and as such was\r\nappreciated by the gentlemen; but neither of the two mothers was equally\r\ndelighted with her, nor was mine at all sorry when, on Tuesday, the boxes\r\nwere packed, posthorses sent for, and my Lady departed, with great\r\nexpressions of thankfulness to us all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A tulip to a jessamine,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered Griff as she drove off, and he looked\r\nup at his Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s sweet refined face.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate Colonel Brereton put an end to himself when the\r\ncourt-martial was half over.  How Clarence was shocked and how ardent was\r\nhis pity!  But Griffith received the thanks of the Corporation of Bristol\r\nfor his gallant conduct, when the special assize was held in January.\r\nMrs. Fordyce was almost as proud of him as we were, and there was much\r\nless attempt at restraining the terms on which he stood with Ellen\xe2\x80\x94though\r\nstill the formal engagement was not permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nQUICKSANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                \xe2\x80\x98Whither shall I go?\r\n    Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                 TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nIT was in the May of the ensuing year, 1832, that Clarence was sent down\r\nto Bristol for a few weeks to take the place of one of the clerks in the\r\noffice where the cargoes of the incoming vessels of the firm were\r\nreceived and overhauled.\r\n\r\nThis was a good-natured arrangement of Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s in order to give\r\nhim change of work and a sight of home, where, by the help of the coach,\r\nhe could spend his Sundays.  That first spring day on his way down was a\r\ngreat delight and even surprise to him, who had never seen our profusion\r\nof primroses, cowslips, and bluebells, nor our splendid blossom of\r\ntrees\xe2\x80\x94apple, lilac, laburnum\xe2\x80\x94all vieing in beauty with one another.\r\nEmily conducted him about in great delight, taking him over to Hillside\r\nto see Mrs. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s American garden, blazing with azaleas, and glowing\r\nwith rhododendrons.  He came back with a great bouquet given to him by\r\nEllen, who had been unusually friendly with him, and he was more animated\r\nand full of life than for years before.\r\n\r\nNext time he came he looked less happy.  There was plenty of room in our\r\nhouse, but he used, by preference, the little chamber within mine, and\r\nthere at night he asked me to lend him a few pounds, since Griffith had\r\nwritten one of his off-hand letters asking him to discharge a little bill\r\nor two at Bristol, giving the addresses, but not sending the accounts.\r\nThis was no wonder, since any enclosure doubled the already heavy\r\npostage.  One of these bills was for some sporting equipments from the\r\ngunsmith\xe2\x80\x99s; another, much heavier, from a tavern for breakfasts, or\r\nrather luncheons, to parties of gentlemen, mostly bearing date in the\r\nsummer and autumn of 1830, before the friendship with the Fordyces had\r\nbegun.  On Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s defraying the first and applying for the second,\r\ntwo more had come in, one from a jeweller for a pair of drop-earrings,\r\nthe other from a nurseryman for a bouquet of exotics.  Doubting of these\r\ntwo last, Clarence had written to Griff, but had not yet received an\r\nanswer.  The whole amount was so much beyond what he had been led to\r\nexpect that he had not brought enough money to meet it, and wanted an\r\nadvance from me, promising repayment, to which latter point I could not\r\nassent, as both of us knew, but did not say, we should never see the sum\r\nagain, and to me it only meant stinting in new books and curiosities.  We\r\nwere anxious to get the matter settled at once, as Griffith spoke of\r\nbeing dunned; and it might be serious, if the tradesmen applied to my\r\nfather when he was still groaning over revelations of college expenses.\r\n\r\nOn the ensuing Saturday, Clarence showed me Griff\xe2\x80\x99s answer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98I had\r\nforgotten these items.  The earrings were a wedding present to the pretty\r\nlittle barmaid, who had been very civil.  The bouquet was for Lady\r\nPeacock; I felt bound to do something to atone for mamma\xe2\x80\x99s severe virtue.\r\nIt is all right, you best of brothers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was consolatory that all the dates were prior to the Hillside fire,\r\nexcept that of the bouquet.  As to the earrings, we all knew that Griff\r\ncould not see a pretty girl without talking nonsense to her.  Anyway, if\r\nthey were a wedding present, there was an end of it; and we were only\r\nglad to prevent any hint of them from reaching the ears of the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nClarence had another trouble to confide to me.  He had strong reason to\r\nbelieve that Tooke, the managing clerk at Bristol, was carrying on a\r\ncourse of peculation, and feathering his nest at the expense of the firm.\r\nWhat a grand discovery, thought I, for such a youth to have made.  The\r\nfirm would be infinitely obliged to him, and his fortune would be\r\nsecured.  He shook his head, and said that was all my ignorance; the man,\r\nTooke, was greatly trusted, especially by Mr. Frith the senior partner,\r\nand was so clever and experienced that it would be almost impossible to\r\nestablish anything against him.  Indeed he had browbeaten Clarence, and\r\nconvinced him at the moment that his suspicions and perplexities were\r\nonly due to the ignorance of a foolish, scrupulous youth, who did not\r\nunderstand the customs and perquisites of an agency.  It was only when\r\nClarence was alone, and reflected on the matter by the light of\r\nexperience gained on a similar expedition to Liverpool, that he had\r\nperceived that Mr. Tooke had been throwing dust in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall only get into a scrape myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence despondently.  \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave felt it coming ever since I have been at Bristol;\xe2\x80\x99 and he pushed his\r\nhair back with a weary hopeless gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to let it alone?\xe2\x80\x99 I cried indignantly.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated in a manner that painfully recalled his failing, and said at\r\nlast, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I suppose I ought not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Suppose?\xe2\x80\x99 I cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not so easy as you think,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98especially for one who\r\nhas forfeited the right to be believed.  I must wait till I have an\r\nopportunity of speaking to Mr. Castleford, and then I can hardly do more\r\nthan privately give him a hint to be watchful.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how things\r\nare in such houses as ours.  One may only ruin oneself without doing any\r\ngood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You cannot write to him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not.  He has taken his family to Mrs. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s home in the\r\nnorth of Ireland for a month or six weeks.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the address, and\r\nI cannot run the risk of the letter being opened at the office.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you speak to my father?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Impossible! it would be a betrayal.  He would do things for which I\r\nshould never be forgiven.  And, after all, remember, it is no business of\r\nmine.  I know of agents at the docks who do such things as a matter of\r\ncourse.  It is only that I happen to know that Harris at Liverpool does\r\nnot.  Very possibly old Frith knows all about it.  I should only get\r\nscored down as a meddlesome prig, worse hypocrite than they think me\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe said a good deal more to this effect, and I remember exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nClarence, the old story!\xe2\x80\x99 and then being frightened at the whiteness that\r\ncame over his face.\r\n\r\nLittle did I know the suffering to which those words of mine condemned\r\nhim.  For not only had he to make up his mind to resistance, which to his\r\nnature was infinitely worse than it was to Griffith to face a raging mob,\r\nbut he knew very well that it would almost inevitably produce his own\r\nruin, and renew the disgrace out of which he was beginning to emerge.  I\r\ndid not\xe2\x80\x94even while I prayed that he might do the right\xe2\x80\x94guess at his own\r\nagony of supplication, carried on incessantly, day and night, sleeping\r\nand waking, that the Holy Spirit of might should brace his will and\r\ngovern his tongue, and make him say the right thing at the right time, be\r\nthe consequences what they might.  No one, not constituted as he was, can\r\nguess at the anguish he endured.  I knew no more.  Clarence did not come\r\nhome the next Saturday, to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s great vexation; but on Tuesday a\r\nsmall parcel was given to me, brought from our point of contact with the\r\nBristol coach.  It contained some pencils I had asked him to get, and a\r\nnote marked _private_.  Here it is\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98DEAR EDWARD\xe2\x80\x94I am summoned to town.  Tooke has no doubt forestalled\r\n    me.  We have had some curious interviews, in which he first, as I\r\n    told you, persuaded me out of my senses that it was all right, and\r\n    then, finding me still dissatisfied, tried in a delicate fashion to\r\n    apprise me that I had a claim to a share of the plunder.  When I\r\n    refused to appropriate anything without sanction from headquarters,\r\n    he threatened me with the consequences of presumptuous interference.\r\n    It came to bullying at last.  I hardly know what I answered, but I\r\n    don\xe2\x80\x99t think I gave in.  Now, a sharp letter from old Frith recalls\r\n    me.  Say nothing at home; and whatever you do, do not betray Griff.\r\n    He has more to lose than I.  Help me in the true way, as you know\r\n    how.\xe2\x80\x94Ever yours, W. C. W.\r\n\r\nI need not dwell on the misery of those days.  It was well that my father\r\nhad ruled that our letters should not be family property.  Here were all\r\nthe others discussing a proposed tour in the north of Devon, to be taken\r\nconjointly with the Fordyces, as soon as Griff should come home.  My\r\nmother said it would do me good; she saw I was flagging, but she little\r\nguessed at the continual torment of anxiety, and my wonder at the warning\r\nabout Griff.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the week came another letter.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98You need not speak yet.  Papa and mamma will know soon enough.  I\r\n    brought down \xc2\xa3150 in specie, to be paid over to Tooke.  He avers that\r\n    only \xc2\xa3130 was received.  What is my word worth against his?  I am\r\n    told that if I am not prosecuted it will only be out of respect to my\r\n    father.  I am not dismissed yet, but shall get notice as soon as\r\n    letters come from Ireland.  I have written, but it is not in the\r\n    nature of things that Mr. Castleford should not accept such proofs as\r\n    have been sent him.  I have no hope, and shall be glad when it is\r\n    over.  The part of black sheep is not a pleasant one.  Say not a\r\n    word, and do not let my father come up.  He could do no good, and to\r\n    see him believing it all would be the last drop in the bucket.\r\n\r\n    _N.B._\xe2\x80\x94In this pass, nothing would be saved by bringing Griff into\r\n    it, so be silent on your life.  Innocence does not seem to be much\r\n    comfort at present.  Maybe it will come in time.  I know you will not\r\n    drop me, dear Ted, wherever I may be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNeed I tell the distress of those days of suspense and silence, when my\r\nonly solace was in being left alone, and in writing letters to Clarence\r\nwhich were mostly torn up again.\r\n\r\nMy horror was lest he should be driven to go off to the sea, which he\r\nloved so well, knowing, as nobody else did, the longing that sometimes\r\nseized him for it, a hereditary craving that curiously conflicted with\r\nthe rest of his disposition; and, indeed, his lack was more of moral than\r\nof physical courage.  It haunted me constantly that his entreaty that my\r\nfather should not come to London was a bad sign, and that he would never\r\nface such another return home.  And was I justified in keeping all this\r\nto myself, when my father\xe2\x80\x99s presence might save him from the flight that\r\nwould indeed be the surrender of his character, and to the life of a\r\ncommon sailor?  Never have I known such leaden days as these, yet the\r\nmisery was not a tithe of what Clarence was undergoing.\r\n\r\nI was right in my forebodings.  Prosecution and a second return home in\r\nshame and disgrace were alike hideous to Clarence, and the present was\r\nalmost equally terrible, for nobody at the office had any doubt of his\r\nguilt, and the young men who had sneered at his strictness and religious\r\nhabits regarded him as an unmasked hypocrite, only waiting on sufferance\r\ntill his greatly deceived patron should write to decide on the steps to\r\nbe taken with him, while he knew he was thought to be brazening it out in\r\nhopes of again deceiving Mr. Castleford.\r\n\r\nThe sea began to exert its power over him, and he thought with longing of\r\nits freedom, as if the sails of the vessels were the wings of a dove to\r\nflee away and be at rest.  He had no illusions as to the roughness of the\r\nlife and companionship; but in his present mood, the frank rudeness and\r\nprofanity of the sailors seemed preferable to his cramped life, and the\r\nscowls of his fellows; and he knew himself to have seamanship enough to\r\nrise quickly, even if he could not secure a mate\xe2\x80\x99s berth at first.\r\n\r\nMr. Castleford could not be heard from till the end of the week.  Friday,\r\nSaturday came and not a word.  That was the climax!  When the consignment\r\nof cash, hitherto carried by Clarence to the Bank of England, was\r\ncommitted to another clerk, the very office boy sniggered, and the\r\nmanager demonstratively waited to see him depart.\r\n\r\nUnable to bear it any longer, he walked towards Wapping, bought a\r\nSouthwester, examined the lists of shipping, and entered into\r\nconversation with one or two sailors about the vessels making up their\r\ncrews; intending to go down after dark, to meet the skipper of a craft\r\nbound for Lisbon, who, he heard, was so much in want of a mate as perhaps\r\nto overlook the lack of testimonials, and at any rate take him on board\r\non Sunday.\r\n\r\nGoing home to pick up a few necessaries, a book lent to him by Miss\r\nNewton came in his way, and he felt drawn to carry it home, and see her\r\nface for the last time.\r\n\r\nAll unconscious of his trouble and of his intentions, the good lady told\r\nhim of her strong desire to hear a celebrated preacher at a neighbouring\r\nchurch on the Sunday evening, but said that in her partial blindness and\r\nweakness, she was afraid to venture, unless he would have the extreme\r\ngoodness, as she said, to take care of her.  He saw that she wished it so\r\nmuch that he had not the heart to refuse, and he recollected likewise\r\nthat very early on Monday morning would answer his purpose equally well.\r\n\r\nIt was the 7th of June.  The Psalm was the 37th\xe2\x80\x94the supreme lesson of\r\npatience.  \xe2\x80\x98Hold thee still in the Lord; and abide patiently on Him; and\r\nHe shall bring it to pass.  He shall make thy righteousness as clear as\r\nthe light, and thy just dealing as the noonday.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe awful sense of desolation seemed to pass away under those words, with\r\nthat gentle woman beside him.  And the sermon was on \xe2\x80\x98Oh tarry thou the\r\nLord\xe2\x80\x99s leisure; be strong, and He shall comfort thine heart; and put thou\r\nthy trust in the Lord.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence remembered nothing but the text.  But it was borne in upon him\r\nthat his purpose of flight was \xe2\x80\x98the old story,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94cowardice and virtual\r\ndistrust of the Lord, as well as absolute cruelty to us who loved him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had deposited Miss Newton at her own door, he whispered thanks,\r\nand an entreaty for her prayers.\r\n\r\nAnd then he went home, and fought the battle of his life, with his own\r\nhorrible dread of Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment; of possible\r\nprosecution; of the shame at home; the misery of a life a second time\r\nblighted.  He fought it out on his knees, many a time persuading himself\r\nthat flight would not be a sin, then returning to the sense that it was a\r\ntemptation of his worse self to be overcome.  And by morning he knew that\r\nit would be a surrender of himself to his lower nature, and the evil\r\nspirit behind it; while, by facing the worst that could befall him, he\r\nwould be falling into the hand of the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nAFTER THE TEMPEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Nor deem the irrevocable past\r\n    As wholly wasted, wholly vain,\r\n    If rising on its wrecks at last\r\n    To something nobler we attain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                               LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\nALL the rest of the family were out, and I was relieved by being alone\r\nwith my distress, not forced to hide it, when the door opened and \xe2\x80\x98Mr.\r\nCastleford\xe2\x80\x99 was announced.  After one moment\xe2\x80\x99s look at me, one touch of\r\nmy hand, he must have seen that I was faint with anxiety, and said, \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis all right, Edward; I see you know all.  I am come from Bristol to tell\r\nyour father that he may be proud of his son Clarence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I did.  Perhaps I sobbed and cried, but the first words\r\nI could get out were, \xe2\x80\x98Does he know?  Oh! it may be too late.  He may be\r\ngone off to sea!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried, breaking out with my chief fear.  Mr.\r\nCastleford looked astounded, then said, \xe2\x80\x98I trust not.  I sent off a\r\nspecial messenger last night, as soon as I saw my way\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen I breathed a little more freely, and could understand what he was\r\ntelling me, namely, that Tooke had accused Clarence of abstracting \xc2\xa320\r\nfrom the sum in his charge.  The fellow accounted for it by explaining\r\nthat young Winslow had been paying extravagant bills at a tavern, where\r\nthe barmaid showed his presents, and boasted of her conquest.  All this\r\nhad been written to Mr. Castleford by his partner, and he was told that\r\nit was out of deference to himself that his _prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9_ was not in custody,\r\nnor had received notice of dismissal; but, no doubt, he would give his\r\nsanction to immediate measures, and communicate with the family.\r\n\r\nThe effect had been to make the good man hurry at once from the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nCauseway to Bristol, where he had arrived on Sunday, to investigate the\r\nbooks and examine the underlings.  In the midst Tooke attempted to\r\nabscond, but he was brought back as he was embarking in an American\r\nvessel; and he then confessed the whole,\xe2\x80\x94how speculation had led to\r\ndishonesty, and following evil customs not uncommon in other firms.\r\nThen, when the fugitive found that young Winslow was too acute to be\r\nblinded, and that it had been a still greater mistake to try to overcome\r\nhis integrity, self-defence required his ruin, or at any rate his\r\nexpulsion, before he could gain Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\nTooke really believed that the discreditable bills were the young man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown, and proofs of concealed habits of dissipation; but this excellent\r\nman had gone into the matter, repaired to the tradesfolk, learnt the\r\ndate, and whose the accounts really were, and had even hunted up the\r\nbarmaid, who was not married after all, and had no hesitation in avowing\r\nthat her beau had been the handsome young Yeomanry lieutenant.  Mr.\r\nCastleford had spent the greater part of Monday in this painful task, but\r\nhad not been clear enough till quite late in the evening to despatch an\r\nexpress to his partner, and to Clarence, whom he desired to meet him\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has acted nobly,\xe2\x80\x99 said our kind friend.  \xe2\x80\x98His only error seems to\r\nhave been in being too good a brother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis made me implore that nothing should be said about Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s bills,\r\nshowing those injunctions of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s which had so puzzled me, and\r\nexplaining the circumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. Castleford hummed and hawed, and perhaps wished he had seen my father\r\nbefore me; but I prevailed at last, and when the others came in from\r\ntheir drive, there was nothing to alloy the intelligence that Clarence\r\nhad shown rare discernment, as well as great uprightness, steadfastness,\r\nand moral courage.\r\n\r\nMy mother, when she had taken in the fact, actually shed tears of joy.\r\nEmily stood by me, holding my hand.  My father said, \xe2\x80\x98It is all owing to\r\nyou, Castleford, and the helping hand you gave the poor boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 was the answer, \xe2\x80\x98it seems to me that it was owing to his having\r\nthe root of the matter in him to overcome his natural failings.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nStill, in all the rejoicing, my heart failed me lest the express should\r\nhave come too late, and Clarence should be already on the high seas, for\r\nthere had been no letter from him on Sunday morning.  It was doubtful\r\nwhether Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s messenger could reach London in time for tidings\r\nto come down by the coach\xe2\x80\x94far less did we expect Clarence\xe2\x80\x94and we had\r\nnearly finished the first course at dinner, when we heard the front door\r\nopen, and a voice speaking to the butler.  Emily screamed \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s he!  Oh\r\nmamma, may I?\xe2\x80\x99 and flew out into the hall, dragging in a pale, worn and\r\nweary wight, all dust and heat, having travelled down outside the coach\r\non a broiling day, and walked the rest of the way.  He looked quite\r\nbewildered at the rush at him; my father\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Well done, Clarence,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nstrong clasp; and my mother\xe2\x80\x99s fervent kiss, and muttered something about\r\nwashing his hands.\r\n\r\nFormal folks, such as we were, had to sit in our chairs; and when he came\r\nback apologising for not dressing, as he had left his portmanteau for the\r\ncarrier, he looked so white and ill that we were quite shocked, and began\r\nto realise what he had suffered.  He could not eat the food that was\r\nbrought back for him, and allowed that his head was aching dreadfully;\r\nbut, after a glass of wine had been administered, it was extracted that\r\nhe had met Mr. Frith at the office door, and been gruffly told that Mr.\r\nCastleford was satisfied, and he might consider himself acquitted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then I had your letter, sir, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, scarcely\r\nrestraining his tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The thanks are on our side, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Castleford.  \xe2\x80\x98I must\r\ntalk it over with you, but not till you have had a night\xe2\x80\x99s rest.  You\r\nlook as if you had not known one for a good while.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence gave a sort of trembling smile, not trusting himself to speak.\r\nApprobation at home was so new and strange to him that he could scarcely\r\nbear it, worn out as he was by nearly a month of doubt, distress,\r\napprehension, and self-debate.\r\n\r\nMy mother went herself to hasten the preparation of his room, and after\r\nshe had sent him to bed went again to satisfy herself that he was\r\ncomfortable and not feverish.  She came back wiping away a tear, and\r\nsaying he had looked up at her just as when she had the three of us in\r\nour nursery cribs.  In truth these two had seldom been so happy together\r\nsince those days, though the dear mother, while thankful that he had not\r\nfailed, was little aware of the conflict his resolution had cost him, and\r\nthe hot journey and long walk came in for more blame for his exhaustion\r\nthan they entirely deserved.\r\n\r\nMy father perhaps understood more of the trial; for when she came back,\r\ndeclaring that all that was needed was sleep, and forbidding me to go to\r\nmy room before bedtime, he said he must bid the boy good-night.\r\n\r\nAnd he spoke as his reserve would have never let him speak at any other\r\ntime, telling Clarence how deeply thankful he felt for the manifestation\r\nof such truthfulness and moral courage as he said showed that the man had\r\nconquered the failings of the boy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when I retired for the night, it was to find Clarence\r\nasleep indeed, but most uneasily, tossing, moaning, and muttering broken\r\nsentences about \xe2\x80\x98disgracing his pennant,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98never bearing to see mamma\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and the like.  I thought it a kindness to wake him, and he started\r\nup.  \xe2\x80\x98Ted, is it you?  I thought I should never hear your dear old crutch\r\nagain!  Is it really all right\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94then, sitting up and passing his hand\r\nover his face, \xe2\x80\x98I always mix it up with the old affair, and think the\r\ncourt-martial is coming again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s all the difference now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank God! yes\xe2\x80\x94He has dragged me through!  But it did not seem so in\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s sleep, nor waking neither\xe2\x80\x94though sleep is worst, and happily there\r\nwas not much of that!  Sit down, Ted; I want to look at you.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve it is not three weeks since I saw you last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe talked it all out, and I came to some perception of the fearful ordeal\r\nit had been\xe2\x80\x94first, in the decision neither to shut his eyes, nor to\r\nconceal that they were open; and then in the lack of presence of mind and\r\nthe sense of confusion that always beset him when browbeaten and talked\r\ndown, so that, in the critical contest with Tooke, he felt as if his feet\r\nwere slipping from under him, and what had once been clear to him was\r\nbecoming dim, so that he had only been assured that he had held his\r\nground by Tooke\xe2\x80\x99s redoubled persuasions and increased anger.  And for a\r\nclerk, whose years were only twenty-one, to oppose a manager, who had\r\nbeen in the service more than the whole of that space, was preposterous\r\ninsolence, and likely to result in the utter ruin of his own prospects,\r\nand the character he had begun to retrieve.  It was just after this, the\r\nreal crisis, that he had the only dream which had not been misery and\r\ndistress.  In it she\xe2\x80\x94she yonder\xe2\x80\x94yes, the lady with the lamp, came and\r\nstood by him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Be steadfast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was a dream,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.  \xe2\x80\x98She was not as she is in the mullion\r\nroom, not crying, but with a sweet, sad look, almost like Miss Fordyce\xe2\x80\x94if\r\nMiss Fordyce ever looked sad.  It was only a dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet it had so refreshed and comforted him that we have often since\r\ndiscussed whether the spirit really visited him, or whether this was the\r\nmanner in which conscience and imagination acted on his brain.  Indeed,\r\nhe always believed that the dream had been either heaven-sent or\r\nheaven-permitted.\r\n\r\nThe die had been cast in that interview when he had let it be seen that\r\nhe was dangerous, and could not be bought over.  The after consequences\r\nhad been the terrible distress and temptation I have before described,\r\nonly most inadequately.  \xe2\x80\x98But that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, half smiling, \xe2\x80\x98only\r\ncame of my being such a wretched creature as I am.  There, dear old Miss\r\nNewton saved me\xe2\x80\x94yes, she did\xe2\x80\x94most unconsciously, dear old soul.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou remember how Griff used to say she maundered over the text.  Well,\r\nshe did it all the way home in my ear, as she clung to my arm\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBe strong,\r\nand He shall comfort thine heart.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then I knew my despair and\r\ndetermination to leave it all behind were a temptation\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe old story,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nas you told me, and I prayed God to help me, and just managed to fight it\r\nout.  Thank God for her!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for that good woman, he would have been out of\r\nreach\xe2\x80\x94already out in the river\xe2\x80\x94before Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s messenger had\r\nreached London!  He might call himself a poor creature\xe2\x80\x94and certainly a\r\nman of harder, bolder stuff would not have fared so badly in the strife;\r\nbut it always seemed to me in after years that much of what he called the\r\npoor creature\xe2\x80\x94the old, nervous, timid, diffident self\xe2\x80\x94had been shaken off\r\nin that desperate struggle, perhaps because it had really given him more\r\nself-reliance, and certainly inspired others with confidence in him.\r\n\r\nWe talked late enough to have horrified my mother, but I did not leave\r\nhim till he was sleeping like a child, nor did he wake till I was leaving\r\nthe room at the sound of the bell.  It was alleged that it was the first\r\ntime in his life that he had been late for prayers.  Mr. Castleford said\r\nhe was very glad, and my mother, looking severely at me, said she knew we\r\nhad been talking all night, and then went off to satisfy herself whether\r\nhe ought to be getting up.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt on that score, for he was quite himself again, though\r\nhe was, in looks and in weariness, just as if he had recovered from a bad\r\nillness, or, as he put it himself, he felt as tired and bruised as if he\r\nhad been in a stiff gale.  Mr. Castleford was sorry to be obliged to ask\r\nhim to go through the whole matter with him in the study, and the result\r\nwas that he was pronounced to have an admirable head for business, as\r\nwell as the higher qualities that had been put to the test.  After that\r\nhis good friend insisted that he should have a long and complete holiday,\r\nat first proposing to take him to Ireland, but giving the notion up on\r\nhearing of our projected excursion to the north of Devon.  Pending this,\r\nClarence was, for nearly a week, fit for nothing but lying on the grass\r\nin the shade, playing with the cats and dogs, or with little Anne,\r\nlooking over our drawings, listening to Wordsworth, our reigning\r\nidol,\xe2\x80\x94and enjoying, with almost touching gratitude, the first approach to\r\npetting that had ever fallen to his share.\r\n\r\nThe only trouble on his mind was the Quarter-Session.  Mr. Castleford\r\nwould hardly have prosecuted an old employ\xc3\xa9, but Mr. Frith was furious,\r\nand resolved to make an example.  Tooke had, however, so carefully\r\nentrenched himself that nothing could be actually made a subject of\r\nprosecution but the abstraction of the \xc2\xa320 of which he had accused\r\nClarence, who had to prove the having received and delivered it.\r\n\r\nIt was a very painful affair, and Tooke was sentenced to seven years\xe2\x80\x99\r\ntransportation.  I believe he became a very rich and prosperous man in\r\nNew South Wales, and founded a family.  My father received warm\r\ncompliments upon his sons, and Clarence had the new sensation of being\r\nhonourably coupled with Griffith, though he laughed at the idea of mere\r\nhonesty with fierce struggles being placed beside heroism with no\r\nstruggle at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nHOLIDAY-MAKING.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98The child upon the mountain side\r\n       Plays fearless and at ease,\r\n    While the hush of purple evening\r\n       Spreads over earth and seas.\r\n    The valley lies in shadow,\r\n       But the valley lies afar;\r\n    And the mountain is a slope of light\r\n       Upreaching to a star.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                          MENELLA SMEDLEY.\r\n\r\nHOW pleasant it was to hear Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s cheery voice, as he swung himself\r\ndown, out of a cloud of dust, from the top of the coach at the wayside\r\nstage-house, whither Clarence and I had driven in the new britshka to\r\nmeet him.  While the four fine coach-horses were led off, and their\r\nsuccessors harnessed in almost the twinkling of an eye, Griff was with\r\nus; and we did nothing but laugh and poke fun at each other all the way\r\nhome, without a word of graver matters.\r\n\r\nI was resolved, however, that Griff should know how terribly his\r\ncommission had added to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s danger, and how carefully the secret\r\nhad been guarded; and the first time I could get him alone, I told him\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nThe effect was one of his most overwhelming fits of laughter.  \xe2\x80\x98Poor old\r\nBill!  To think of his being accused of gallanting about with barmaids!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(an explosion at every pause) \xe2\x80\x98and revelling with officers!  Poor old\r\nBill! it was as bad as Malvolio himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen, indignant at the mirth excited by what had nearly cost us so dear,\r\nI observed that these items had nearly turned the scale against our\r\nbrother, Griff demanded how we could have been such idiots as not to have\r\nwritten to him; I might at least have had the sense to do so.  As to its\r\ndoing him harm at Hillside, Parson Frank was no fool, and knew what men\r\nwere made of!  Griff would have taken the risk, come at once, and thrust\r\nthe story down the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s throat (as indeed he would have done).  The\r\nidea of Betsy putting up with a pious young man like Bill, whose only\r\nflame had ever been old Miss Newton!  And he roared again at the\r\nincongruous pair.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she married after all, the hussy?  She\r\nalways had a dozen beaux, and professed to be on the point of putting up\r\nher banns; so if the earrings were not a wedding present, they might have\r\nbeen, ought to have been, and would be some time or other.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he patted me, and declared there was no occasion for my disgusted\r\nlooks, for no one knew better than himself that he had the best brace of\r\nbrothers in existence, wanting in nothing but common sense and knowledge\r\nof the world.  As to Betsy\xe2\x80\x94faugh!  I need not make myself uneasy about\r\nher; she knew what a civil word was worth much better than I did.\r\n\r\nHe showed considerable affection for Clarence after a fashion of his own,\r\nwhich we three perfectly understood, and preferred to anything more\r\nconventional.  Griff was always delightful, and he was especially so on\r\nthat vacation, when every one was in high spirits; so that the journey\r\nis, as I look back on it, like a spot of brilliant sunshine in the\r\ndistant landscape.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fordyce kept house with her father-in-law, little Anne, and Martyn,\r\nwhose holidays began a week after we had started.  The two children were\r\nallowed to make a desert island and a robbers\xe2\x80\x99 cave in the beech wood;\r\nand the adventures which their imaginations underwent there completely\r\nthrew ours into the shade.\r\n\r\nThe three ladies and I started in the big Hillside open carriage, with my\r\nbrothers on the box and the two fathers on horseback.  Frank Fordyce was\r\na splendid rider, as indeed was the old rector, who had followed the\r\nhounds, made a leap over a fearful chasm, still known as the Parson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nStride, and had been an excellent shot.  The renunciation of field sports\r\nhad been a severe sacrifice to Frank Fordyce, and showed of what\r\nexcellent stuff he was made.  He used to say that it was his own fault\r\nthat he had to give them up; another man would have been less engrossed\r\nby them.  Though he only read by fits and starts when his enthusiasm was\r\nexcited, he was thorough, able, and acute, and his intelligence and\r\nsympathy were my father\xe2\x80\x99s best compensation for the loss of London\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe two riders were a great contrast.  Mr. Winslow had the thoroughly\r\nwell-appointed, somewhat precise, and highly-polished air of a barrister,\r\nand a thin, somewhat worn and colourless face, with grizzled hair and\r\nwhite whiskers; and though he rode well, with full command of his horse,\r\nhe was old enough to have chosen Chancery for her sterling qualities.\r\nParson Frank, on the other hand, though a thorough gentleman, was as\r\nruddy and weather-browned as any farmer, and\xe2\x80\x94albeit his features were\r\nhandsome and refined, and his figure well poised and athletic\xe2\x80\x94he lost\r\nsomething of dignity by easiness of gesture and carelessness of dress,\r\nexcept on state occasions, when he discarded his beloved rusty old coat\r\nand Oxford mixture trousers, and came out magnificent enough for an\r\narchdeacon, if not an archbishop; while his magnificent horse, Cossack,\r\nwas an animal that a sporting duke might have envied.\r\n\r\nNothing ever tired that couple, but my father had stipulated for\r\nexchanges with Griffith.  On these occasions it almost invariably\r\nhappened that there was a fine view for Ellen to see, so that she was\r\nexalted to the box with Griffith to show it to her, and Chancery was\r\nconsigned to Clarence.  Griff was wont to say that Chancery deserved her\r\nname, and that he would defy the ninety-ninth part of a tailor to come to\r\nharm with her; but Clarence was utterly unpractised in riding, did not\r\nlike it, was tormented lest Cossack\xe2\x80\x99s antics should corrupt Chancery, and\r\nwas mortally afraid of breaking the knees of the precious mare.  Not all\r\nParson Frank\xe2\x80\x99s good advice and kindly raillery would induce him to risk\r\nriding her on a descent; and as our travels were entirely up and down\r\nhill, he was often left leading her far behind, in hot sun or misty rain,\r\nand then would come cantering hastily up, reckless of parallels with John\r\nGilpin, and only anxious to be in time to help me out at the\r\nhalting-place; but more than once only coming in when the beefsteaks were\r\nlosing their first charm, and then good-humouredly serving as the general\r\nbutt for his noble horsemanship.  Did any one fully comprehend how much\r\npleasanter our journey was through the presence of one person entirely at\r\nthe service of the others?  For my own part, it made an immense\r\ndifference to have one pair of strong arms and dextrous well-accustomed\r\nhands always at my service, enabling me to accomplish what no one else,\r\nkind as all were, would have ventured on letting me attempt.  Primarily,\r\nhe was my devoted slave; but he was at the beck and call of every one,\r\nmaking the inquiries, managing the bargains, going off in search of\r\nwhatever was wanting\xe2\x80\x94taking in fact all the \xe2\x80\x98must be dones\xe2\x80\x99 of the\r\njournal.  The contemplation of Cossack and Chancery being rubbed down,\r\nand devouring their oats was so delightful to Frank Fordyce and Griffith\r\nthat they seldom wished to shirk it; but if there were any more pleasing\r\noccupation, it was a matter of course that Clarence should watch to see\r\nthat the ostlers did their duty by the animals\xe2\x80\x94an obsolete ceremony, by\r\nthe bye.  He even succeeded in hunting up and hiring a side saddle when\r\nthe lovers, with the masterfulness of their nature, devised appropriating\r\nthe horses at all the most beautiful places, in spite of Frank\xe2\x80\x99s murmur,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will mamma say?\xe2\x80\x99  But, as Griff said, it was a real mercy, for\r\nEllen was infinitely more at her ease with Chancery than was Clarence.\r\nThen Emily had Clarence to walk up the hills with her, and help her in\r\nbotany\xe2\x80\x94her special department in our tour.  Mine was sketching, Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nkeeping the journal, though we all shared in each other\xe2\x80\x99s work at times;\r\nand Griff, whose line was decidedly love-making, interfered considerably\r\nwith us all, especially with our chronicler.  I spare you the tour, young\r\npeople; it lies before me on the table, profusely illustrated and written\r\nin many hands.  As I turn it over, I see noble Dunster on its rock;\r\nClarence leading Chancery down Porlock Hill; Parson Frank in vain pursuit\r\nof his favourite ancient hat over that wild and windy waste, the sheep\r\nrunning away from him; a boat tossing at lovely Minehead; a \xe2\x80\x98native\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbargaining over a crab with my mother; the wonderful Valley of Rocks, and\r\nmany another scene, ludicrous or grand; for, indeed, we were for ever\r\ntaking the one step between the sublime and the ridiculous!  I am\r\ninclined to believe it is as well worth reading as many that have rushed\r\ninto print, and it is full of precious reminiscences to Emily and me; but\r\nthe younger generation may judge for itself, and it would be an\r\ninterruption here.  The country we saw was of utterly unimagined beauty\r\nto the untravelled eyes of most of us.  I remember Ellen standing on\r\nHartland Point, with her face to the infinite expanse of the Atlantic,\r\nand waving back Griff with \xe2\x80\x98Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to me.\xe2\x80\x99  Yet the sea was a\r\ndelight above all to my mother and Clarence.  To them it was a beloved\r\nfriend; and magnificent as was Lynmouth, wonderful as was Clovelly, and\r\nglorious as was Hartland, I believe they would equally have welcomed the\r\nwaves if they had been on the flattest of muddy shores!  The ripple,\r\nplash, and roar were as familiar voices, the salt smell as native air;\r\nand my mother never had thawed so entirely towards Clarence as when she\r\nfound him the only person who could thoroughly participate her feeling.\r\n\r\nAt Minehead they stayed out, walking up and down together in the summer\r\ntwilight till long after every one else was tired out, and had gone in;\r\nand when at last they appeared she was leaning on Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s arm, an\r\nunprecedented spectacle!\r\n\r\nAt Appledore, the only place on that rugged coast where boating tempted\r\nthem, there was what they called a pretty little breeze, but quite enough\r\nto make all the rest of us decline venturing out into Bideford bay.\r\nThey, however, found a boatman and made a trip, which was evidently such\r\nenjoyment to them, that my father, who had been a little restless and\r\nuneasy all the time, declared on their return that he felt quite jealous\r\nof Neptune, and had never known what a cruelty he was committing in\r\nasking a sea-nymph to marry a London lawyer.\r\n\r\nMr. Fordyce told him he was afraid of being like the fisherman who wedded\r\na mermaid, and made Ellen tell the story in her own pretty way; but while\r\nwe were laughing over it, I saw my mother steal her hand into my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand give it a strong grasp.  Such gestures, which she denominated pawing,\r\nwhen she witnessed them in Emily, were so alien to her in general that no\r\ndoubt this little action was infinitely expressive to her husband.  She\r\nwas wonderfully softened, and Clarence implied to me that it was the\r\nfirst time she had ever seemed to grieve for him more than she despised\r\nhim, or to recognise his deprivation more than his disgrace,\xe2\x80\x94implied, I\r\nsay, for the words he used were little more than\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t think how\r\nnice she was to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe regaining of esteem and self-respect was lessening Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbashfulness, and bringing out his powers of conversation, so that he\r\nbegan to be appreciated as a pleasant companion, answering Griff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nraillery in like fashion, and holding his own in good-natured repartee.\r\nMr. Fordyce got on excellently with him in their t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaates (who would\r\nnot with Parson Frank?), and held him in higher estimation than did\r\nEllen.  To her, honesty was common, tame, and uninteresting in comparison\r\nwith heroism; and Griff\xe2\x80\x99s vague statement that Clarence was the best\r\nbrother in the world did not go for much.  Emily and I longed to get the\r\ntwo better acquainted, but it did not become possible while Griff\r\nabsorbed the maiden as his exclusive property.\r\n\r\nThe engagement was treated as an avowed and settled thing, though I do\r\nnot know that there had been a formal ratification by the parents; but in\r\ntruth Mrs. Fordyce must have tacitly yielded her consent when she\r\npermitted her daughter to make the journey under the guardianship of\r\nParson Frank.  After a walk in the ravine of Lynton, we became aware of a\r\nring upon Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s finger; and Emily was allowed at night to hear how and\r\nwhen it had been put on.\r\n\r\nEllen only slightly deepened her lovely carnation tints when her father\r\nindulged in a little tender teasing and lamentation over himself.  She\r\nwas thoroughly happy and proud of her hero, and not ashamed of owning it.\r\n\r\nThere was one evening when she and I were sitting with our sketchbooks in\r\nthe shade on the beech at Ilfracombe, while the rest had gone, some to\r\nbathe, the others to make purchases in the town.  We had been condoling\r\nwith one another over the impossibility of finding anything among our\r\nwater-colours that would express the wondrous tints before our eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, nothing can do it,\xe2\x80\x99 I said at last; \xe2\x80\x98we can only make a sort of blot\r\nto assist our memories.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sunshine outside and in!\xe2\x80\x99 said Ellen.  \xe2\x80\x98The memory of such days as these\r\ncan never fade away,\xe2\x80\x94no, nor thankfulness for them, I hope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomething then passed about the fact that it was quite possible to go on\r\nin complete content in a quiet monotonous life, in an oyster-like way,\r\ntill suddenly there was an unveiling and opening of unimagined capacities\r\nof enjoyment\xe2\x80\x94as by a scene like this before us, by a great poem, an\r\noratorio, or, as I supposed, by Niagara or the Alps.  Ellen put it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\r\nand by feelings for the great and good!\xe2\x80\x99  Dear girl, her colour deepened,\r\nand I am sure she meant her bliss in her connection with her hero.\r\nPresently, however, she passed on to saying how such revelations of\r\nunsuspected powers of enjoyment helped one to enter into what was meant\r\nby \xe2\x80\x98Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the\r\nheart of man to conceive, the things that God hath prepared for them that\r\nlove him.\xe2\x80\x99  Then there was a silence, and an inevitable quoting of the\r\n_Christian Year_, the guide to all our best thoughts\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98But patience, there may come a time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd then a turning to the \xe2\x80\x98Ode to Immortality,\xe2\x80\x99 for Wordsworth was our\r\nsecond leader, and we carried him on our tour as our one secular book, as\r\nKeble was our one religious book.  We felt that the principal joy of all\r\nthis beauty and delight was because there was something beyond.\r\nPresently Ellen said, prettily and shyly, \xe2\x80\x98I am sure all this has opened\r\nmuch more to me than I ever thought of.  I always used to be glad that we\r\nhad no brothers, because our cousins were not always pleasant with us;\r\nbut now I have learnt what valuable possessions they are,\xe2\x80\x99 she added,\r\nwith the sweetest, prettiest glance of her bright eyes.\r\n\r\nI ventured to say that I was glad she said they, and hoped it was a sign\r\nthat she was finding out Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have found out that I behaved so ill to him that I have been ashamed\r\never since to look at him or speak to him,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ellen; \xe2\x80\x98I long to ask\r\nhis pardon, but I believe that would distress him more than anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIn which she was right; and I was able to tell her of the excuses there\r\nhad been for the poor boy, how he had suffered, and how he had striven to\r\nconquer his failings; and she replied that the words \xe2\x80\x98Judge not, that ye\r\nbe not judged,\xe2\x80\x99 always smote her with the remembrance of her disdainfully\r\ncantering past him.  There was a tear on her eye-lashes, and it drew from\r\nme an apology for having brought a painful recollection into our bright\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There must be shade to throw up the lights,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, with her\r\nsparkling look.\r\n\r\nWas it shade that we never fell into one of these grave talks when\r\nGriffith was present, and that the slightest approach to them was sure to\r\nbe turned by him into jest?\r\n\r\nWe made our journey a little longer than we intended, crossing the moors\r\nso as to spend a Sunday at Exeter; but Frank Fordyce left us, not liking\r\nto give his father the entire duty of a third Sunday.\r\n\r\nEmily says she has come to have a superstition that extensions of\r\noriginal plans never turn out well, and certainly some of the charm of\r\nour journey departed with the merry, genial Parson Frank.  Our mother was\r\nmore anxious about Ellen, and put more restrictions on the lovers than\r\nwhen the father was present to sanction their doings.  Griffith\r\nabsolutely broke out against her in a way he had never ventured before,\r\nwhen she forbade Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s riding with him when he wanted to hire a horse\r\nat Lydford and take an excursion on the moor before joining us at\r\nOkehampton.\r\n\r\nMy father looked up, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Griffith, I am surprised at you.\xe2\x80\x99  He was\r\nconstrained to mutter some apology, and I believe Ellen privately begged\r\nmy mother\xe2\x80\x99s pardon, owning her to have been quite right; but, by the dear\r\ngirl, the wonderful cascade and narrow gorge were seen through swollen\r\neyes.  And poor Clarence must have had a fine time of it when Griffith\r\nhad to ride off with him _faute de mieux_.\r\n\r\nAll was cleared off, however, when we met again, for Griff\xe2\x80\x99s storms were\r\nvery fleeting, and Ellen treated him as if she had to make her own peace\r\nwith him.  She sacrificed her own enjoyment of Exeter Cathedral to go\r\nabout with him when he had had enough of it, but on Sunday afternoon she\r\naltogether declined to walk with him till after the second service.  He\r\nlaughed at her supposed passion for sacred music, and offered to wait\r\nwith her to hear the anthem from the nave.  \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98that would\r\nbe amusing ourselves instead of worshipping.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve done our devoir in that way already,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff.  \xe2\x80\x98Paid our\r\ndues.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Ellen, with an eager look.  \xe2\x80\x98One longs to do all the\r\nmore when He has just let us have such a taste of His beautiful things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_One_, perhaps, when one is a little saint,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Griff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh don\xe2\x80\x99t, Griff!  I\xe2\x80\x99m not _that_; but you know every one wants all the\r\nhelp and blessing that can be got.  And then it is so delightful!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe gave a long whistle.  \xe2\x80\x98Every one to his taste,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98especially\r\nyou ladies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe did come to the Cathedral with us, but he had more than half spoilt\r\nthis last Sunday.  Did he value her for what was best in her, or was her\r\ninfluence raising him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nC. MORBUS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Forgot were hatred, wrongs, and fears,\r\n    The plaintive voice alone she hears,\r\n       Sees but the dying man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                    SCOTT.\r\n\r\nC. MORBUS, Esq.  Such was the card that some wicked wag, one of\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s fellow-clerks probably, left at his lodgings in the course of\r\nthe epidemic which was beginning its ravages even while we were upon our\r\npleasant journey\xe2\x80\x94a shade indeed to throw out the light.\r\n\r\nIn these days, the tidings of a visitation of cholera are heard with\r\ncompassion for crowded towns, but without special alarm for ourselves or\r\nour friends, since its conditions and the mode of combating it have come\r\nto be fairly understood.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, however, it was a disease almost unknown and unprecedented\r\nexcept in its Indian abode, whence it had advanced city by city, seaport\r\nby seaport, sweeping down multitudes before it; nor had science yet\r\ndiscovered how to encounter or forestall it.  We heard of it in a\r\nhelpless sort of way, as if it had been the plague or the Black Death,\r\nand thought of its victims as doomed.\r\n\r\nThat terrible German engraving, \xe2\x80\x98Death as a Foe,\xe2\x80\x99 which represents the\r\ngrisly form as invading a ballroom in Paris, is an expression of the\r\nfeeling with which the scourge was regarded on that first occasion.  _Two\r\nYears Ago_ gives some notion of the condition of things in 1849, but by\r\nthat time there had been some experience, and means of prevention were\r\nbetter understood.  On the alarm in that year there was a great\r\ninspection of cottages throughout Earlscombe and Hillside, but in 1832\r\nthere was no notion of such precautions.  Nevertheless, on neither\r\nvisitation, nor any subsequent one, has the disease come nearer to us\r\nthan Bristol.\r\n\r\nAs far as memory serves me, the idea was that wholesome food, regular\r\nhabits, and cleanliness were some protection, but one locality might be\r\nas dangerous as another.  There had been cases in London all the spring,\r\nbut no special anxiety was felt when Clarence returned to his work in the\r\nend of July, much refreshed and invigorated by his holiday, and with the\r\nunderstanding that he was to have a rise in position and salary on Mr.\r\nCastleford\xe2\x80\x99s return from Ireland, where he was still staying with his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s relations.  Clarence was received at the office with a kind of\r\nshamefaced cordiality, as if every one would fain forget the way in which\r\nhe had been treated; and he was struck by finding that all the talk was\r\nof the advances of the cholera, chiefly at Rotherhithe.  And a great\r\nshock awaited him.  He went, as soon as business hours were over, to\r\nthank good old Miss Newton for the comfort and aid she had unwittingly\r\ngiven him, and to tell her from what she had saved him.  Alas! it was the\r\nlast benefit she was ever to confer on her old pupil.  At the door he was\r\ntold by a weeping, terrified maid that she was very ill with cholera, and\r\nthat no hope was given.  He tried to send up a message, but she was in a\r\nstate of collapse and insensible; and when he inquired the next morning,\r\nthe gentle spirit had passed away.\r\n\r\nHe attended her funeral that same evening.  Griff said it was a proof how\r\nyour timid people will do the most foolhardy things; but Clarence always\r\nheld that the good woman had really done more for him than any one in\r\nactually establishing a contact, so to say, between his spirit and\r\nexternal truth, and he thought no mark of respect beyond her deserts.\r\nShe was a heavy loss to him, for no one else in town gave him the sense\r\nof home kindness; and there was much more to depress him, for several of\r\nhis Sunday class were dead, and the school had been broken up for the\r\ntime, while the heats and the fruits of August contributed to raise the\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\nHis return had released a couple more clerks for their holiday; it was a\r\nslack time of year, with less business in hand than usual, and the place\r\nlooked empty.  Mr. Frith worked on as usual, but preserved an ungracious\r\nattitude, as though he were either still incredulous or, if convinced\r\nagainst his will, resolved that \xe2\x80\x98that prig of a Winslow\xe2\x80\x99 should not\r\npresume upon his services.  Altogether the poor fellow was quite\r\nunhinged, and wrote such dismal bills of mortality, and meek, resigned\r\nforebodings that my father was almost angry, declaring that he would\r\nfrighten himself into the sickness; yet I suppressed a good deal, and\r\nnever told them of the last will and testament in which he distributed\r\nhis possessions amongst us.  Griff said he had a great mind to go and\r\nshake old Bill up and row him well, but he never did.\r\n\r\nMore than a week passed by, two of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s regular days for writing,\r\nbut no letter came.  My mother grew uneasy, and talked of writing to Mrs.\r\nRobson, or, as we still called her, Gooch; but it was doubtful whether\r\nthe answer would contain much information, and it was quite certain that\r\nany ill tidings would be sent to us.\r\n\r\nAt last we did hear, and found, as we had foreboded, that the letter had\r\nnot been written for fear of alarming us, or carrying infection, though\r\nClarence underlined the words \xe2\x80\x98I am perfectly well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHaving to take a message into the senior partner\xe2\x80\x99s room, Clarence had\r\nfound the old man crouched over the table, writhing in the unmistakable\r\ngrip of the deadly enemy.  No one else was available; Clarence had to\r\ncollect himself, send for the doctor, and manage the conveyance of the\r\npatient to his rooms, which fortunately adjoined the office; for, through\r\nall his influx of wealth, Mr. Frith had retained the habits and\r\nexpenditure of his early struggling days.  His old housekeeper and her\r\ndrudge showed themselves terrified out of their senses, and as incapable\r\nas unwilling.  Naval experience, and waiting on me, had taught Clarence\r\nhelpfulness and handiness; and though this was the very thing that had\r\nappalled his imagination, he seemed, as he said afterwards, \xe2\x80\x98to have got\r\nbeyond his fright\xe2\x80\x99 to the use of his commonsense.  And when at last the\r\ndoctor came, and talked of finding a nurse, if possible, for they were\r\nscarce articles, the sufferer only entreated between his paroxysms,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Stay, Winslow!  Is Winslow there?  Don\xe2\x80\x99t go!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo nurse was to be found, but to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s amazement Gooch arrived.  He\r\nhad sent by the office boy to explain his absence; and before night the\r\nfaithful woman descended on him, intending, as in her old days of\r\nauthority, simply to put Master Clarry out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, and take the\r\ncharge upon herself.  Then, as he proved unmanageable and would not leave\r\nhis patient, neither would she leave him, and through the frightful night\r\nthat ensued, there was quite employment enough for them both.  Gooch\r\nfully thought the end would come before morning, and was murmuring\r\nsomething about a clergyman, but was cut short by a sharp prohibition.\r\nHowever, detecting Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s lips moving, the old man said, \xe2\x80\x98Eh! speak\r\nit out!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98And with difficulty, feeling as if I were somebody else,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nClarence, \xe2\x80\x98I did get out some short words of prayer.  It seemed so awful\r\nfor him to die without any.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor came in early morning, the watchers were astonished to\r\nhear that their charge had taken a turn for the better, and might recover\r\nif their admirable care were continued.  The doctor had brought a nurse;\r\nbut Mr. Frith would not let her come into the room, and there was plenty\r\nof need for her elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSeveral days of unremitting care followed, during which Clarence durst\r\nnot write to us, so little were the laws of infection understood.  Good\r\nMrs. Robson stayed all the time, and probably saved Clarence from falling\r\na victim to his zeal, for she looked after him as anxiously as after the\r\nsick man; and with a wondering and thankful heart, he found himself in\r\nfull health, when both were set free to return home.  Clarence had\r\nwritten at the beginning of the illness to the only relations of whose\r\nexistence or address he was aware, an old sister, Mrs. Stevens, and a\r\nyoung great-nephew in the office at Liverpool; and the consequence was\r\nthe arrival of a sour-looking, old widow sister, who came to take charge\r\nof the convalescence, and, as the indignant Gooch overheard her say, \xe2\x80\x98to\r\nprevent that young Winslow from getting round him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere were no signs of such a feat having been performed, when, the panic\r\nbeing past, my father went up to London with Griffith, who was to begin\r\neating his terms at the Temple.  He was to share Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings, for\r\nthe Robsons had plenty of room, and Gooch was delighted to extend her\r\ncares to her special favourite, as she already reigned over Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwardrobe and table as entirely as in nursery days; and, to my great\r\nexultation, my father said it would be good for Griffith to be with his\r\nbrother; and, moreover, we should hear of the latter.  Nothing could be a\r\ngreater contrast than his rare notifications or requests, scrawled on a\r\nsingle side of the quarto sheet, with Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s regular weekly lines of\r\nclerkly manuscript, telling all that could interest any of us, and\r\ncovering every available flap up to the blank circle left for the trim\r\nred seal.\r\n\r\nPromotion had come to Clarence in the natural course of seniority, and a\r\nsmall sum, due to him on his coming of age, was invested in the house of\r\nbusiness, so that the two brothers could take between them all the\r\nRobsons\xe2\x80\x99 available rooms.  Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s post was one of considerable trust;\r\nbut there were no tokens of special favour, except that Mr. Frith was\r\nmore civil to my father than usual, and when he heard of the arrangement\r\nabout the lodgings, he snarled out, \xe2\x80\x98Hm!  Law student indeed!  Don\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nhim spoil his brother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhich was so far an expression of gratitude that it showed that he\r\nconsidered that there was something to be spoilt.  Mr. Castleford,\r\nhowever, showed real satisfaction in the purchase of a share in the\r\nconcern for Clarence.  His own eldest son inherited a good deal of his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s Irish nature, and was evidently unfit to be anything but a\r\nsoldier, and the next was so young that he was glad to have a promising\r\nand trustworthy young man, from whom a possible joint head of the firm\r\nmight be manufactured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nPETER\xe2\x80\x99S THUNDERBOLT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours you are welcome\r\n    to the house; if not, an it would please you to take leave of her,\r\n    she is very willing to bid you farewell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94_Twelfth Night_.\r\n\r\nIN the early summer of 1833, we had the opportunity of borrowing a\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s house in Portman Square for six weeks, and we were allowed to\r\ntake Ellen with us for introduction to the Admiral and other old friends,\r\nwhile we were to make acquaintance with her connections\xe2\x80\x94the family of Sir\r\nHorace Lester, M.P.\r\n\r\nWe were very civil; but there were a good many polite struggles for the\r\nexclusive possession of Ellen, whom both parties viewed as their\r\nindividual right; and her unselfish good-humour and brightness must have\r\ncarried her over more worries than we guessed at the time.\r\n\r\nShe had stayed with the Lesters before, but in schoolroom days.  They\r\nwere indolent and uninterested, and had never shown her any of the\r\npermanent wonders of London, despising these as only fit for country\r\ncousins, whereas we had grown up to think of them with intelligent\r\naffection.  To me, however, much was as new as to Ellen.  Country life\r\nhad done so much for me that I could venture on what I had never\r\nattempted before.  The Admiral said it was getting away from doctors and\r\ntheir experiments, but I had also done with the afflictions of attempts\r\nat growth in wrong directions.  Old friends did not know me, and more\r\nthan once, as I sat in the carriage, addressed me for one of my\r\nbrothers\xe2\x80\x94a compliment which, Griff said, turned my head.  Happily I was\r\ntoo much accustomed to my own appearance, and people were too kind, for\r\nme to have much shyness on that score.  Our small dinner parties were\r\ngreat enjoyment to me, and the two girls were very happy in their little\r\ngaieties.\r\n\r\nBraham and Catalani, Fanny Kemble, and Turner\xe2\x80\x99s landscapes at his best,\r\nrise in my memory as supreme delights and revelations in their different\r\nlines, and awakening trains of thought; and then there was that\r\nentertainment which Griffith and Clarence gave us in their rooms, when\r\nthey regaled us with all the delicacies of the season, and Peter and\r\nGooch looked all pride and hospitality!  The dining-parlour, or what\r\nserved as such, was Griff\xe2\x80\x99s property, as any one could see by the\r\npictures of horses, dogs, and ladies, the cups, whips, and boxing-gloves\r\nthat adorned it; the sitting-room had tokens of other occupation, in\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s piano, window-box of flowers, and his one extravagance in\r\nengravings from Raffaelle, and a marine water-colour or two, besides all\r\nmy own attempts at family portraits, with a case of well-bound books.\r\nThose two rooms were perfectly redolent of their masters\xe2\x80\x94I say it\r\nliterally\xe2\x80\x94for the scent of flowers was in Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s room, and in\r\nGriff\xe2\x80\x99s, the odour of cigars had not wholly been destroyed even by much\r\nairing.  For in those days it was regarded by parents and guardians as an\r\nobjectionable thing.\r\n\r\nPeter was radiant on that occasion; but a few evenings later, when all\r\nwere gone to an evening party except my father and myself, Mr. Robson was\r\nannounced as wishing to speak to Mr. Winslow.  After the civilities\r\nproper to the visit of an old servant had passed, he entered with obvious\r\nreluctance on the purpose of his visit, namely, his dissatisfaction with\r\nGriff as a lodger.  His wife, he said, would not have had him speak, she\r\nwas _that_ attached to Mr. Griffith, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more if he was her\r\nown son; nor was it for want of liking for the young gentleman on his\r\npart, as had known him from a boy, \xe2\x80\x98but the wife of one\xe2\x80\x99s bosom must come\r\nfirst, sir, as stands to reason, and it\xe2\x80\x99s for the good of the young\r\ngentleman himself, and his family, as some one should speak.  I never\r\nsaid one word against it when she would not be satisfied without running\r\nthe risk of her life after Mr. Clarence; hattending of Mr. Frith in the\r\ncholery.  That was only her dooty, sir, and I have never a word to say\r\nagainst dooty: but I cannot see her nearly wore out, and for no good to\r\nnobody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Mrs. Robson was \xe2\x80\x98pretty nigh wore out, a setting up for\r\nMr. Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s untimely hours.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98He laughed and coaxed\xe2\x80\x94what I calls\r\ncajoling\xe2\x80\x94did Mr. Griff, to get a latch-key; but we knows our dooty too\r\nwell for that, and Mrs. Winslow had made us faithfully promise, when\r\nMaster Clarence first came to us, that he should never have a\r\nlatch-key,\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Clarence, as had only been five times later than eleven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then he was going to dine with Mr. Castleford, or to the\r\ntheayter, and spoke about it beforehand.  If he was not reading to poor\r\nMiss Newton, as was gone, or with some of his language-masters, he was\r\nsetting at home with his books and papers, not giving no trouble to\r\nnobody, after he had had his bit of bread and cheese and glass of beer to\r\nhis supper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAy, Peter knew what young gentlemen was.  He did not expect to see them\r\nall like poor Master Clarence, as had had his troubles; the very life\r\nknocked out of him in his youth, as one might say.  Indeed Peter would be\r\npleased to see him a bit more sprightly, and taking more to society and\r\nhamusements of his hage.  Nor would there be any objection if the late\r\n\xe2\x80\x99ours was only once a week or so, and things was done in a style fitting\r\nthe family; but when it came to mostly every night, often to two or three\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock, it was too much for Mrs. Robson, for she would never go to bed,\r\nbeing mortal afraid of fire, and not always certain that Mr. Griffith\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94to say\xe2\x80\x94fit to put out his candle.  \xe2\x80\x98What do you mean, Peter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthundered my father, whose brow had been getting more and more furrowed\r\nevery moment.  \xe2\x80\x98Say it out!\xe2\x80\x94Drunk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well sir, no, no, not to say that exactly, but a little excited, sir,\r\nand women is timid.  No sir, not to call intoxicated.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, that\xe2\x80\x99s to come,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered my father.  \xe2\x80\x98Has this often happened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPeter did not think that it had been noticed more than three times at the\r\nmost; but he went on to offer his candid and sensible advice that Mr.\r\nGriffith should be placed in a family where there was a gentleman or lady\r\nwho would have some hauthority, and could not be put aside with his\r\ngood-\xe2\x80\x99umoured haffability\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re an old fogy, Peter.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\r\nNursey, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good boy next time,\xe2\x80\x99 and the like.  \xe2\x80\x98It is a\r\ndisadvantage you see, sir, to have been in his service, and \xe2\x80\x99tis for the\r\nyoung gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s own good as I speaks; but it would be better if he were\r\nsomewheres else\xe2\x80\x94unless you would speak to him, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo the almost needless question whether Clarence had been with his\r\nbrother on these occasions, there was a most decided negative.  He had\r\nnever gone out with Griffith except once to the theatre, and to dine at\r\nthe Castlefords, and at first he had sat up for his return, \xe2\x80\x98but it led\r\nto words between the young gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x99 said Peter, whose confidences were\r\nbecoming reckless; and it appeared that when Clarence had found that\r\nGooch would not let him spare her vigil, he had obeyed her orders and\r\nceased to share it.\r\n\r\nPeter was thanked for the revelations, which had been a grievous effort\r\nto him, and dismissed.  My father sat still in great distress and\r\nperplexity, asking me whether Clarence had ever told me anything of this,\r\nand I had barely time to answer \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 before Clarence himself came in,\r\nfrom what Peter called his language-master.  He was taking lessons in\r\nFrench and Spanish, finding a knowledge of these useful in business.  To\r\nhis extreme distress, my father fell on him at once, demanding what he\r\nknew of the way Griffith was spending his time, \xe2\x80\x98coming home at all sorts\r\nof hours in a disreputable condition.  No prevarication, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 he added,\r\nas the only too familiar look of consternation and bewilderment came over\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s face.  \xe2\x80\x98You are doing your brother no good by conniving at his\r\nconduct.  Speak truth, if you can,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, with more cruelty than he\r\nknew, in his own suffering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir,\xe2\x80\x99 gasped Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98I know Griff often comes home after I am in bed,\r\nbut I do not know the exact time, nor anything more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this all you can tell me?  Really all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98All I know\xe2\x80\x94that is\xe2\x80\x94of my own knowledge,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, recovering a\r\nlittle, but still unable to answer without hesitation, which vexed my\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do you mean by that?  Do you hear nothing?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98that I do not see as much of him as I had\r\nhoped.  He is not up till after I have to be at our place, and he does\r\nnot often spend an evening at home.  He is such a popular fellow, and has\r\nso many friends and engagements.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ay, and of what sort?  Can\xe2\x80\x99t you tell? or will you not?  I sent him up\r\nto you, thinking you a steady fellow who might influence him for good.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe colour rushed into Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s face, as he answered, looking up and\r\nspeaking low, \xe2\x80\x98Have I not forfeited all such hopes?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!  You\xe2\x80\x99ve lived down that old story long ago.  You would make\r\nyour mark, if you only showed a little manliness and force of character.\r\nGriffith was always fond of you.  Can\xe2\x80\x99t you do anything to hinder him\r\nfrom ruining his own life and that sweet girl\xe2\x80\x99s happiness?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would\xe2\x80\x94I would give my life to do so!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed Clarence, in warm,\r\neager tones.  \xe2\x80\x98I have tried, but he says I know nothing about it, and it\r\nis very dull at our rooms for him.  I have got used to it, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect a fellow like Griff to stay at home, with no better company than\r\nme, and do nothing but read law.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you _do_ know,\xe2\x80\x99 began my father; but Clarence, with full\r\nself-possession, said, \xe2\x80\x98I think you had better ask me no more questions,\r\npapa.  I really know nothing, or hardly anything, personally of his\r\nproceedings.  I went to one supper with him, after going to the play, and\r\ndid not fancy it; besides, it almost unfitted me for my morning\xe2\x80\x99s work;\r\nnor does it answer for me to sit up for him\xe2\x80\x94it only vexes him, as if I\r\nwere watching him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did you ever see him come home showing traces of excess?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98I never saw!\xe2\x80\x99 and, under a stern, distressed look,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Once I heard tones that\xe2\x80\x94that startled me, and Mrs. Robson has grumbled a\r\ngood deal\xe2\x80\x94but I think Peter takes it for more than it is worth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father more gently; \xe2\x80\x98I will not press you farther.  I\r\nbelieve I ought to be glad that these habits are only hearsay to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As far as I can see,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence diffidently, but quite restored to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x98Griff is only like most of his set, young men who go into\r\nsociety.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, in a \xe2\x80\x98that\xe2\x80\x99s your opinion\xe2\x80\x99 kind of tone; and as at\r\nthat moment the yell of a newsboy was heard in the street, he exclaimed\r\nthat he must go and get an evening paper.  Clarence made a step to go\r\ninstead, but was thrust back, as apparently my father merely wanted an\r\nexcuse for rushing into the open air to recover the shock or to think it\r\nover.\r\n\r\nClarence gave a kind of groan, and presently exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98If only untruth\r\nwere not such a sin!\xe2\x80\x99 and, on my exclamation of dismay, he added, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think a blowing up ever does good!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But this state of things should not last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It will not.  It would have come to an end without Peter\xe2\x80\x99s springing\r\nthis mine.  Griff says he can\xe2\x80\x99t stand Gooch any longer!  And really she\r\ndoes worry him intolerably.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Peter professed to come without her knowledge or consent.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so.  It will almost break the good old soul\xe2\x80\x99s heart for Griff to\r\nleave her; but she expects to have him in hand as if he was in the\r\nnursery.  She is ever so much worse than she was with me, and he is\r\nreally good-nature itself to laugh off her nagging as he does\xe2\x80\x94about what\r\nhe chooses to put on, or eating, or smoking, or leaving his room untidy,\r\nas well as other things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And those other things?  Do you suspect more than you told papa?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It amounts to no more.  Griff likes amusement, and everybody likes\r\nhim\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s all.  Yes, I know my father read law ten hours a day, but his\r\nwhole nature and circumstances were different.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe Griff\r\ncould go on in that way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not with such a hope before him?  You would, Clarence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis face and not his tongue answered me, but he added, \xe2\x80\x98Griff is sure of\r\n_that_ without so much labour and trouble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And do you see so little of him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep his hours and do my work.  Yes, I know we\r\nare drifting apart; I wish I could help it, but being coupled up together\r\nmakes it rather worse than better.  It aggravates him, and he will really\r\nget on better without Gooch to worry him, and thrust my droning old ways\r\ndown his throat,\xe2\x80\x94as if Prince Hal could bear to be twitted with \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nsober boy, Lord John of Lancaster.\xe2\x80\x9d  Not,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, catching himself up,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that I meant to compare him to the madcap Prince.  He is the finest of\r\nfellows, if they only would let him alone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd that was all I could get from Clarence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nA SQUIRE OF DAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98Spited with a fool\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Spited and angered both.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                              _Cymbeline_.\r\n\r\nTHIS long stay of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s in our family had made our fraternal relations\r\nwith her nearer and closer.  Familiarity had been far from lessening our\r\nstrong feeling for her goodness and sweetness.  Emily, who knew her best,\r\nused to confide to me little instances of the spirit of devotion and\r\nself-discipline that underlay all her sunny gaiety\xe2\x80\x94how she never failed\r\nin her morning\xe2\x80\x99s devout readings; how she learnt a verse or two of\r\nScripture every day, and persuaded Emily to join with her in repeating it\r\nere they went downstairs for their evening\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure; how she had set\r\nherself a little task of plain work for the poor, which she did every day\r\nin her own room; and the like dutiful habits, which seemed, as it were,\r\nto help her to keep herself in hand, and not be carried away by what was\r\na whirl of pleasure to her, though a fashionable young lady would have\r\ndespised its mildness.\r\n\r\nIndeed Lady Peacock, with whom we exchanged calls, made no secret of her\r\ncompassion when she found how many parties the ladies were _not_ going\r\nto; and Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s own relations, the Lesters, would have taken her out\r\nalmost every night if she had not staunchly held to her promise to her\r\nmother not to go out more than three evenings in the week, for Mrs.\r\nFordyce knew her to be delicate, and feared late hours for her.  The\r\nvexation her cousins manifested made her feel the more bound to give them\r\nwhat time she could, at hours when Griffith was not at liberty.  She did\r\nnot like them to be hurt, and jealous of us, or to feel forsaken, and she\r\ntried to put her affection for us on a different footing by averring that\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it was not the same kind of thing\xe2\x80\x94Emily was her sister.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOne day she had gone to luncheon with the Lesters in Cavendish Square,\r\nand was to be called for in the carriage by me, on the way to take up the\r\nother two ladies, who were shopping in Regent Street.\r\n\r\nEllen came running downstairs, with her cheeks in a glow under the pink\r\nsatin lining of her pretty bonnet, and her eyes sparkling with\r\nindignation, which could not but break forth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I shall ever go there again!\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x98they have\r\nno right to say such things!\xe2\x80\x99  Then she explained.  Mary and Louisa had\r\nbeen saying horrid things about Griffith\xe2\x80\x94her Griff!  It was always their\r\nway.  Think how Horace had made her treat Clarence!  It was their way and\r\nhabit to tease, and call it fun, and she had never minded it before; but\r\nthis was too bad.  Would not I put it in her power to give a flat\r\ncontradiction, such as would make them ashamed of themselves?\r\n\r\nContradict what?\r\n\r\nThen it appeared that the Misses Lester had laughed at her, who was so\r\nvery particular and scrupulous, for having taken up with a regular young\r\nman about town.  Oh no, _they_ did not think much of it\xe2\x80\x94no doubt he was\r\nonly just like other people; only the funny thing was that it should be\r\nEllen, for whom it was always supposed that no saint in the calendar, no\r\nknight in all the Waverley novels, would be good enough!  And then, on\r\nher hot desire to know what they meant, they quoted John, the brother in\r\nthe Guards, as having been so droll about poor Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s perfect hero, and\r\nespecially at his straight-laced Aunt Fordyce having been taken in,\xe2\x80\x94but\r\nof course it was the convenience of joining the estates, and it was\r\nagreeable to see that your very good folk could wink at things like other\r\npeople in such a case.  Then, when Ellen fairly drove her inquiries home,\r\nin her absolute trust of confuting all slanders, she was told that\r\nGriffith did, what she called \xe2\x80\x98all sorts of things\xe2\x80\x94billiards and all\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x99  And even that he was always running after a horrid Lady Peacock,\r\na gay widow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They went on in fun,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ellen, \xe2\x80\x98and laughed the more when\xe2\x80\x94yes, I am\r\nafraid I did\xe2\x80\x94I lost my temper.  No, don\xe2\x80\x99t say I well might, I know I\r\nought not; but I told them I knew all about Lady Peacock, and that you\r\nwere all old friends, even before he rescued her from the Bristol riots\r\nand brought her home to Chantry House; and that only made Mary merrier\r\nthan ever, and say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, another distressed damsel?  Take care, Ellen;\r\nI would not trust such a squire of dames.\xe2\x80\x9d  And then Louisa chimed in,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh no, you see this Peacock dame was only conducted, like Princess\r\nMicomicona and all the rest of them, to the feet of his peerless\r\nDulcinea!\xe2\x80\x9d  And then I heard the knock, and I was never so glad in my\r\nlife!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 I could not help remarking, \xe2\x80\x98I have heard of women\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nspitefulness, but I never believed it till now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I really don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was altogether what you call malice, so much as\r\nthe Lester idea of fun,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ellen, recovering herself after her\r\noutpouring.  \xe2\x80\x98A very odd notion I always thought it was; and Mary and\r\nLouisa are not really ill-natured, and cannot wish to do the harm they\r\nmight have done, if I did not know Griff too well.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen, after considering a little, she said, blushing, \xe2\x80\x98I believe I have\r\ntold you more than I ought, Edward\xe2\x80\x94I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help having it out; but\r\nplease don\xe2\x80\x99t tell any one, especially that shocking way of speaking of\r\nmamma, which they could not really mean.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No one could who knew her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Of course not.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I mean to do.  I will write to Mary\r\nwhen we go in, and tell her that I know she really cares for me enough to\r\nbe glad that her nonsense has done no mischief, and, though I was so\r\nfoolish and wrong as to fly into a passion, of course I know it is only\r\nher way, and I do not believe one word of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomehow, as she looked with those radiant eyes full of perfect trust, I\r\ncould not help longing not to have heard Peter Robson\xe2\x80\x99s last night\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncomplaint; but family feeling towards outsiders overcomes many a\r\nmisgiving, and my wrath against the malignity of the Lesters was quite as\r\nstrong as if I had been devoid of all doubts whether Griff wore to all\r\nother eyes the same halo of pure glory with which Ellen invested him.\r\n\r\nSuch doubts were very transient.  Dear old Griff was too delightful, too\r\nbright and too brave, too ardent and too affectionate, not to dispel all\r\nclouds by the sunshine he carried about with him.  If rest and reliance\r\ncame with Clarence, zest and animation came with Griffith.  He managed to\r\ntake the initiative by declining to remain any longer with the Robsons,\r\nsaying they had been spoilt by such a model lodger as Clarence, who would\r\nlet Gooch feed him on bread and milk and boiled mutton, and put on his\r\nclean pinafore if she chose to insist; whereas her indignation, when\r\nGriff found fault with the folding of his white ties, amounted to \xe2\x80\x98_Et tu\r\nBrute_,\xe2\x80\x99 and he really feared she would have had a fit when he ordered\r\ndevilled kidneys for breakfast.  He was sure her determination to tuck\r\nhim up every night and put out his candle was shortening her life; and he\r\nhad made arrangements to share the chambers of a friend who had gone\r\nthrough school and college with him.  There was no objection to the\r\nfriend, who had stayed at Chantry House and was an agreeable, lively,\r\nyoung man, well reported of, satisfactorily connected, fairly\r\nindustrious, and in good society, so that Griff was likely to be much\r\nless exposed to temptation of the lower kinds than when left to his own\r\ndevices, or only with Clarence, who had neither time nor disposition to\r\nshare his amusements.\r\n\r\nThere was a scene with my father, but in private; and all that came to\r\ngeneral knowledge was that Griff felt himself injured by any implication\r\nthat he was given to violent or excessive dissipation, such as could\r\nwreck Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s happiness or his own character.\r\n\r\nHe declared with all his heart that immediate marriage would be the best\r\nthing for both, and pleaded earnestly for it; but my father could not\r\nhave arranged for it even if the Fordyces would have consented, and there\r\nwere matters of business, as well as other reasons, which made it\r\ninexpedient for them to revoke their decision that the wedding should not\r\ntake place before Ellen was of age and Griffith called to the bar.\r\n\r\nSo we took our young ladies home, loaded with presents for their beloved\r\nschool children, of whom Emily said she dreamt, as the time for seeing\r\nthem again drew near.  After all the London enjoyment, it was pretty to\r\nsee the girls\xe2\x80\x99 delight in the fresh country sights and sounds in full\r\nsummer glory, and how Ellen proved to have been hungering after all her\r\ndear ones at home.  When we left her at her own door, our last sight of\r\nher was in her father\xe2\x80\x99s arms, little Anne clinging to her dress, mother\r\nand grandfather as close to her as could be\xe2\x80\x94a perfect tableau of a joyous\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nLOVE AND OBEDIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Unless he give me all in change\r\n       I forfeit all things by him;\r\n    The risk is terrible and strange.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                            MRS. BROWNING.\r\n\r\nYOU will be weary of my lengthiness; and perhaps I am lingering too long\r\nover the earlier portion of my narrative.  Something is due to the\r\ndisproportion assumed in our memories by the first twenty years of\r\nexistence\xe2\x80\x94something, perhaps, to reluctance to passing from comparative\r\nsunshine to shadow.  There was still a period of brightness, but it was\r\nso uneventful that I have no excuse for dwelling on it further than to\r\nsay that Henderson, our excellent curate, had already made a great\r\ndifference in the parish, and it was beginning to be looked on as almost\r\nequal to Hillside.  The children were devoted to Emily, who was the\r\nsource of all the amenities of their poor little lives.  The needlework\r\nof the school was my mother\xe2\x80\x99s pride; and our church and its services,\r\nthough you would shudder at them now, were then thought presumptuously\r\nsuperior \xe2\x80\x98for a country parish.\xe2\x80\x99  They were a real delight and blessing\r\nto us, as well as to many more of the flock, who still, in their old age,\r\nremember and revere Parson Henderson as a sort of apostle.\r\n\r\nThe dawning of the new Poor-Law led to investigations which revealed the\r\ntrue conditions of the peasant\xe2\x80\x99s life\xe2\x80\x94its destitution, recklessness, and\r\ndependence.  We tried to mend matters by inducing families to emigrate,\r\nbut this renewed the distrust which had at first beheld in the schools an\r\nattempt to enslave the children.  Even accounts, sent home by the\r\nexceptionally enterprising who did go to Canada, were, we found, scarcely\r\ntrusted.  Amos Bell, who would have gone, if he had not been growing into\r\nmy special personal attendant, was letter-writer and reader to all his\r\nrelations, and revealed to us that it had been agreed that no letter\r\nshould be considered as genuine unless it bore a certain private mark.\r\nTo be sure, the accounts of prosperity might well sound fabulous to the\r\ntoilers and moilers at home.  Harriet Martineau\xe2\x80\x99s _Hamlets_, which we\r\nlent to many of our neighbours, is a fair picture of the state of things.\r\nWe much enjoyed those tales, and Emily says they were the only political\r\neconomy she ever learnt.\r\n\r\nThe model arrangements of our vestries led to a summons to my father and\r\nthe younger Mr. Fordyce to London, to be examined on the condition of the\r\npauper, and the working of the old Elizabethan Poor-Law.\r\n\r\nThey were absent for about a fortnight of early spring, and Emily and I\r\ncould not help observing that our mother was unusually uncommunicative\r\nabout my father\xe2\x80\x99s letters; and, moreover, there was a tremendous\r\nrevolution of the furniture, a far more ominous token in our household\r\nthan any comet.\r\n\r\nThe truth came on us when the two fathers returned.  Mine told me himself\r\nthat Frank Fordyce was so much displeased with Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s conduct that he\r\nhad declared that the engagement could not continue with his consent.\r\n\r\nThis from good-natured, tender-hearted Parson Frank!\r\n\r\nI cried out hotly that \xe2\x80\x98those Lesters\xe2\x80\x99 had done this.  They had always\r\nbeen set against us, and any one could talk over Mr. Frank.  My father\r\nshook his head.  He said Frank Fordyce was not weak, but all the stronger\r\nfor his gentleness and charity; and, moreover, that he was quite right\xe2\x80\x94to\r\nour shame and grief be it spoken\xe2\x80\x94quite right.\r\n\r\nIt was true that the first information had been given by Sir Horace\r\nLester, Mrs. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s brother, but it had not been lightly spoken like\r\nthe daughter\xe2\x80\x99s chatter; and my father himself had found it only too true,\r\nso that he could not conscientiously call Griffith worthy of such a\r\ncreature as Ellen Fordyce.\r\n\r\nPoor Griff, he had been idle and impracticable over his legal studies,\r\nwhich no persuasion would make him view as otherwise than a sort of\r\nnominal training for a country gentleman; nor had he ever believed or\r\nacted upon the fact that the Earlscombe property was not an unlimited\r\nfortune, such as would permit him to dispense with any profession, and\r\nspend time and money like the youths with whom he associated.  Still,\r\nthis might have been condoned as part of the effervescence which had\r\nexcited him ever since my father had succeeded to the estate, and\r\npatience might still have waited for greater wisdom; but there had been\r\ngraver complaints of irregularities, which were forcing his friend to\r\ndissolve partnership with him.  There was evidence of gambling, which he\r\nnot only admitted, but defended; and, moreover, he was known at parties,\r\nat races, and at the theatre, as one of the numerous satellites who\r\nrevolved about that gay and conspicuous young fashionable widow, Lady\r\nPeacock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, Frank has every right to be angry,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, pacing the\r\nroom.  \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t wonder at him.  I should do the same; but it is\r\ndestroying the best hope for my poor boy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he began to wish Clarence had more\xe2\x80\x94he knew not what to call it\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nhim; something that might keep his brother straight.  For, of course, he\r\nhad talked to Clarence and discovered how very little the brothers saw of\r\none another.  Clarence had been to look for Griff in vain more than once,\r\nand they had only really met at a Castleford dinner-party.  In fact,\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s youthful spirits, and the tastes which would have made him\r\ncompanionable to Griff, had been crushed out of him; and he was what more\r\nrecent slang calls \xe2\x80\x98such a muff,\xe2\x80\x99 that he had perforce drifted out of our\r\nelder brother\xe2\x80\x99s daily life, as much as if he had been a grave senior of\r\nfifty.  It was, as he owned, a heavy penalty of his youthful fall that he\r\ncould not help his brother more effectually.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Frank Fordyce, thoroughly roused, had had it out with\r\nGriffith, and had declared that his consent was withdrawn and the\r\nengagement annulled.  Griff, astounded at the resolute tone of one whom\r\nhe considered as the most good-natured of men, had answered hotly and\r\nproudly that he should accept no dismissal except from Ellen herself, and\r\nthat he had done no more than was expected of any young man of position\r\nand estate.  On the other indictment he scorned any defence, and the two\r\nhad parted in mutual indignation.  He had, however, shown himself so much\r\ndistressed at the threat of being deprived of Ellen, that neither my\r\nfather nor Clarence had the least doubt of his genuine attachment to her,\r\nnor that his attentions to Lady Peacock were more than the effect of old\r\nhabit and love of amusement, and that they had been much exaggerated.  He\r\nscouted the bare idea of preferring her to Ellen; and, in his second\r\ninterview with my father, was ready to make any amount of promises of\r\nreformation, provided his engagement were continued.\r\n\r\nThis was on the last evening before leaving town, and he came to the\r\ncoach-office looking so pale, jaded, and unhappy that Parson Frank\xe2\x80\x99s kind\r\nheart was touched; and in answer to a muttered \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been ten thousand\r\nfools, sir, but if you will overlook it I will try to be worthy of her,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe made some reply that could be construed into, \xe2\x80\x98If you keep to that,\r\nall may yet be well.  I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to her mother and grandfather.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPerhaps this was cruel kindness, for, as we well knew, Mrs. Fordyce was\r\nfar less likely to be tolerant of a young man\xe2\x80\x99s failings than was her\r\nhusband; and she was, besides, a Lester, and might take the same view.\r\n\r\nAbusing the Lesters was our great resource; for we did not believe either\r\nthe sailor or the guardsman to be immaculate, and we knew them to be\r\njealous.  We had to remain in ignorance of what we most wished to know,\r\nfor Ellen was kept away from us, and my mother would not let Emily go in\r\nsearch of her.  Only Anne, who was a high-spirited, independent little\r\nperson, made a sudden rush upon me as I sat in the garden.  She had no\r\nbusiness to be so far from home alone; but, said she, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care, it\r\nis all so horrid.  Please, Edward, is it true that Griff has been so very\r\nwicked?  I heard the maids talking, and they said papa had found out that\r\nhe was a bad lot, and that he was not to marry Ellen; but she would stick\r\nto him through thick and thin, like poor Kitty Brown who would marry the\r\nman that got transported for seven years.\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Will he be transported,\r\nEdward? and would Ellen go too, like the \xe2\x80\x9cnut-brown maid?\xe2\x80\x9d  Is that what\r\nshe cries so about?  Not by day, but all night.  I know she does, for her\r\nhandkerchief is wet through, and there is a wet place on her pillow\r\nalways in the morning; but she only says, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d and nobody _will_\r\ntell me.  They only say little girls should not think about such things.\r\nAnd I am not so very little.  I am eight, and have read the _Lay of the\r\nLast Minstrel_ and I know all about people in love.  So you might tell\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI relieved Anne\xe2\x80\x99s mind as to the chances of transportation, and, after\r\nconsidering how many confidences might be honourably exchanged with the\r\nchild, I explained that her father thought Griff had been idle and\r\ncareless, and not fit as yet to be trusted with Ellen.\r\n\r\nHer parish experience came into play.  \xe2\x80\x98Does papa think he would be like\r\nJoe Sparks?  But then gentlemen don\xe2\x80\x99t beat their wives, nor go to the\r\npublic-house, nor let their children go about in rags.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI durst not inquire much, but I gathered that there was a heavy shadow\r\nover the house, and that Ellen was striving to do as usual, but breaking\r\ndown when alone.  Just then Parson Frank appeared.  Anne had run away\r\nfrom him while on a farming inspection, when the debate over the turnips\r\nwith the factotum had become wearisome.  He looked grave and sorrowful,\r\nquite unlike his usual hearty self, and came to me, leaning over my\r\nchair, and saying, \xe2\x80\x98This is sad work, Edward\xe2\x80\x99; and, on an anxious venture\r\nof an inquiry for Ellen, \xe2\x80\x98Poor little maid, it is very sore work with\r\nher.  She is a good child and obedient\xe2\x80\x94wants to do her duty; but we\r\nshould never have let it go on so long.  We have only ourselves to\r\nthank\xe2\x80\x94taking the family character, you see\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94and he made a kindly gesture\r\ntowards me.  \xe2\x80\x98Your father sees how it is, and won\xe2\x80\x99t let it make a split\r\nbetween us.  I believe that not seeing as much of your sister as usual is\r\none of my poor lassie\xe2\x80\x99s troubles, but it may be best\xe2\x80\x94it may be best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe lingered talking, unwilling to tear himself away, and ended by\r\ndisclosing, almost at unawares, that Ellen had held out for a long time,\r\nwould not understand nor take in what she was told, accepted nothing on\r\nLester authority, declared she understood all about Lady Peacock, and\r\nshowed a strength of resistance and independence of view that had quite\r\nstartled her parents, by proving how far their darling had gone from them\r\nin heart.  But they still held her by the bonds of obedience; and, by\r\ndealing with her conscience, her mother had obtained from her a piteous\r\nlittle note\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98MY DEAR GRIFFITH\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid it is true that you have not always\r\n    seemed to be doing right, and papa and mamma forbid our going on as\r\n    we are.  You know I cannot be disobedient.  It would not bring a\r\n    blessing on you.  So I must break off, though\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe \xe2\x80\x98though\xe2\x80\x99 could be read through an erasure, followed by the initials,\r\nE. M. F.\xe2\x80\x94as if the dismal conclusion had been felt to be only too\r\ntrue\xe2\x80\x94and there followed the postscript, \xe2\x80\x98Forgive me, and, if we are\r\npatient, it may come right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis letter was displayed, when, on the ensuing evening, it brought Griff\r\ndown in towering indignation, and trying to prove the coercion that must\r\nhave been exercised to extract even thus much from his darling.  Over he\r\nwent headlong to Hillside to insist on seeing her, but to encounter a\r\nsuccession of stormy scenes.  Mrs. Fordyce was the most resolute, but was\r\nill for a week after.  The old Rector was gentle, and somewhat overawed\r\nGriff by his compassion, and by representations that were only too true;\r\nand Parson Frank, with his tender heart torn to pieces, showed symptoms\r\nof yielding another probation.\r\n\r\nThe interview with Ellen was granted.  She, however, was intrenched in\r\nobedience.  She had promised submission to the rupture of her engagement,\r\nand she kept her word,\xe2\x80\x94though she declared that nothing could hinder her\r\nlove, and that she would wait patiently till her lover had proved\r\nhimself, to everybody\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction, as good and noble as she knew him\r\nto be.  When he told her she did not love him she smiled.  She was sure\r\nthat whatever mistakes there might have been, he would give no further\r\noccasion against himself, and then every one would see that all had been\r\nmere misunderstanding, and they should be happy again.\r\n\r\nSuch trust humbled him, and he was ready to make all promises and\r\nresolutions; but he could not obtain the renewal of the engagement, nor\r\npermission to correspond.  Only there was wrung out of Parson Frank a\r\npromise that if he could come in two years with a perfectly unstained,\r\nunblotted character, the betrothal might be renewed.\r\n\r\nWe were very thankful for the hope and motive, and Griff had no doubts of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One can\xe2\x80\x99t look at the pretty creature and think of disappointing her,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said.  \xe2\x80\x98She is altered, you know, Ted; they\xe2\x80\x99ve bullied her till she is\r\nmore ethereal than ever, but it only makes her lovelier.  I believe if\r\nshe saw me kill some one on the spot she would think it all my\r\ngenerosity; or, if she could not, she would take and die.  Oh no!  I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nnot fail her.  No, I won\xe2\x80\x99t; not if I have to spend seven years after the\r\nmodel of old Bill, whose liveliest pastime is a good long sermon, when it\r\nis not a ghost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nUNA OR DUESSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Soone as the Elfin knight in presence came\r\n    And false Duessa, seeming ladye fayre,\r\n    A gentle husher, Vanitie by name,\r\n    Made roome, and passage did for them prepare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                  SPENSER.\r\n\r\nTHE two families were supposed to continue on unbroken terms of\r\nfriendship, and we men did so; but Mrs. Fordyce told my mother that she\r\nhad disapproved of the probation, and Mrs. Winslow was hurt.  Though the\r\ntwo girls were allowed to be together as usual, it was on condition of\r\nsilence about Griff; and though, as Emily said, they really had not been\r\nalways talking about him in former times, the prohibition seemed to weigh\r\nupon all they said.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Fordyce had long been talking of a round of visits among\r\nrelations whom he had not seen for many years; and it was decided to send\r\nEllen with him, chiefly, no doubt, to prevent difficulties about Griffith\r\nin the long vacation.\r\n\r\nThere was no embargo on the correspondence with my sister, and letters\r\nfull of description came regularly, but how unlike they were to our\r\njournal.  They were clear, intelligent, with a certain liveliness, but no\r\nring of youthful joy, no echo of the heart, always as if under restraint.\r\nGriff was much disappointed.  He had been on his good behaviour for two\r\nmonths, and expected his reward, and I could not here repeat all that he\r\nsaid about her parents when he found she was absent.  Yet, after all, he\r\ngot more pity and sympathy from Parson Frank than from any one else.\r\nThat good man actually sent a message for him, when Emily was on honour\r\nto do no such thing.  Poor Emily suffered much in consequence, when she\r\nwould neither afford Griff a blank corner of her paper, nor write even a\r\nveiled message; while as to the letters she received and gave to him,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what was the use,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98of giving him what might have been read\r\naloud by the town-crier?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, Griff; it is all dear Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s conscientiousness\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, deliver me from such con-sci-en-tious-ness,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, in a tone\r\nof bitter mimicry, and flung out of the room leaving Emily in tears.\r\n\r\nHe could not appreciate the nobleness of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s self-command and the\r\nobedience which was the security of future happiness, but was hurt at\r\nwhat he thought weak alienation.  One note of sympathy would have done\r\nmuch for Griff just then.  I have often thought it over since, and come\r\nto the conclusion that Mrs. Fordyce was justified in the entire\r\nseparation she brought about.  No one can judge of the strength with\r\nwhich \xe2\x80\x98true love\xe2\x80\x99 has mastered any individual, nor how far change may be\r\npossible; and, on the other hand, unless there were full appreciation of\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s character, she might only have been looked on as\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Puppet to a father\xe2\x80\x99s threat,\r\n    Servile to a shrewish tongue.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nYet, after all, Frank Fordyce was very kind to Griff, making himself as\r\nmuch of a medium of communication as he could consistently with his\r\nconscience, but of course not satisfying one who believed that the\r\nstrength of love was to be proved not by obedience but disobedience.\r\n\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s letters showed increasing anxiety about her grandfather, who was\r\nnot favourably affected by the change of habits, consequent on a long\r\njourney, and staying in different houses.  His return was fixed two or\r\nthree times, and then delayed by slight attacks of illness, till at last\r\nhe became anxious to get home, and set off about the end of September;\r\nbut after sleeping a night at an inn at Warwick, he was too ill to\r\nproceed any farther.  His old man-servant was with him; but poor Ellen\r\nwent through a great deal of suspense and responsibility before her\r\nparents reached her.  The attack was paralysis, and he never recovered\r\nthe full powers of mind or body, though they managed to bring him back to\r\nHillside\xe2\x80\x94as indeed his restlessness longed for his native home.  When\r\nonce there he became calmer, but did not rally; and a second stroke\r\nproved fatal just before Easter.  He was mourned alike by rich and poor,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He _was_ a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x99 said even Chapman, \xe2\x80\x98always the same to rich or\r\npoor, though he was one of they Fordys.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy father wrote to summon both his elder sons to the funeral at Hillside,\r\nand in due time Clarence appeared by the coach, but alone.  He had gone\r\nto Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s chambers to arrange about coming down together, but found\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s letter lying unopened on the table, and learnt that his\r\nbrother was supposed to be staying at a villa in Surrey, where there were\r\nto be private theatricals.  He had forwarded the letter thither, and it\r\nwould still be possible to arrive in time by the night mail.\r\n\r\nSo entirely was Griff expected that the gig was sent to meet him at seven\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the next morning, but there was no sign of him.  My father and\r\nClarence went without him to the gathering, which showed how deeply the\r\ngood old man was respected and loved.\r\n\r\nIt was the only funeral Clarence had attended except Miss Newton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhurried one, and his sensitive spirit was greatly affected.  He had\r\nlearnt reserve when amongst others, but I found that he had a strong\r\nforeboding of evil; he tossed and muttered in his sleep, and confessed to\r\nhaving had a wretched night of dreams, though he would not describe them\r\notherwise than that he had seen the lady whose face he always looked on\r\nas a presage of evil.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the _Morning Post_ gave a full account of the amateur\r\ntheatricals at Bella Vista, the seat of Benjamin Bullock, Esquire, and\r\nthe Lady Louisa Bullock; and in the list of _dramatis person\xc3\xa6_, there\r\nfigured Griffith Winslow, Esquire, as Captain Absolute, and the fair and\r\naccomplished Lady Peacock as Lydia Languish.\r\n\r\nAmateur theatricals were much less common in those days than at present,\r\nand were held as the _ne plus ultra_ of gaiety.  Moreover, the Lady\r\nLouisa Bullock was noted for fashionable extravagance of the\r\nsemi-reputable style; and there would have been vexation enough at\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x99s being her guest, even had not the performance taken place on\r\nthe very day of the funeral of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, so as to be an\r\noutrage on decorum.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there came a packet franked by a not very satisfactory\r\npeer, brother to Lady Louisa.  My father threw a note over to Clarence,\r\nand proceeded to read a very properly expressed letter full of apologies\r\nand condolences for the Fordyces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He could not have got the letter in time\xe2\x80\x99 was my father\xe2\x80\x99s comment.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When did you forward the letter?  How was it addressed?  Clarence, I\r\nsay, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence lifted up his face from his letter, so much flushed that my\r\nmother broke in\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?  A mistake in the post-town would\r\naccount for the delay.  Has he had the letter?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not in time\xe2\x80\x94eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid,\xe2\x80\x99 and he faltered, \xe2\x80\x98he did.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did he or did he not?\xe2\x80\x99 demanded my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does he say?\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed my father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir\xe2\x80\x99 (always an unpropitious beginning for poor Clarence), \xe2\x80\x98I should\r\nprefer not showing you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed my mother: \xe2\x80\x98you do no good by concealing it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me see his letter,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, in the voice there was no\r\ngainsaying, and absolutely taking it from Clarence.  None of us will ever\r\nforget the tone in which he read it aloud at the breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98DEAR BILL\xe2\x80\x94What possessed you to send a death\xe2\x80\x99s-head to the feast?\r\n    The letter would have bitten no one in my chambers.  A nice scrape I\r\n    shall be in if you let out that your officious precision forwarded\r\n    it.  Of course at the last moment I could not upset the whole affair\r\n    and leave Lydia to languish in vain.  The whole thing went off\r\n    magnificently.  Keep counsel and no harm is done.  You owe me that\r\n    for sending on the letter.\xe2\x80\x94Yours,\r\n\r\n                                                                \xe2\x80\x98J. G. W.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence had not read to the end when the letter was taken from him.\r\nIndeed to inclose such a note in a dispatch sure to be opened _en\r\nfamille_ was one of Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s haphazard proceedings, which arose from\r\nthe present being always much more to him than the absent.  Clarence was\r\nmuch shocked at hearing these last sentences, and exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98He meant it\r\nin confidence, papa; I implore you to treat it as unread!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy father was always scrupulous about private letters, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I beg\r\nyour pardon, Clarence; I should not have forced it from you.  I wish I\r\nhad not seen it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy mother gave something between a snort and a sigh.  \xe2\x80\x98It is right for us\r\nto know the truth,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but that is enough.  There is no need that\r\nthey should know at Hillside what was Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s alternative.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I would not add a pang to that dear girl\xe2\x80\x99s grief,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father; \xe2\x80\x98but\r\nI see the Fordyces were right.  I shall never do anything to bring these\r\ntwo together again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy mother chimed in with something about preferring Lady Peacock and the\r\nBella Vista crew to Ellen and Hillside, which made us rush into the\r\nbreach with incoherent defence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I know how it was,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.  \xe2\x80\x98His acting is capital, and of\r\ncourse these people could not spare him, nor understand how much it\r\nsignified that he should be here.  They make so much of him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who do?\xe2\x80\x99 asked my mother.  \xe2\x80\x98Lady Peacock?  How do you know?  Have you\r\nbeen with them?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have dined at Mr. Clarkson\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 Clarence avowed; and, on further\r\npressure, it was extracted that Griffith\xe2\x80\x94handsome, and with talents such\r\nas tell in society\xe2\x80\x94was a general favourite, and much engrossed by people\r\nwho found him an enlivenment and ornament to their parties.  There had\r\nbeen little or nothing of late of the former noisy, boyish dissipation;\r\nbut that the more fashionable varieties were getting a hold on him became\r\nevident under the cross-questioning to which Clarence had to submit.\r\n\r\nMy father said he felt like a party to a falsehood when he sent Griff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter up to Hillside, and he indemnified himself by writing a letter\r\nmore indignant\xe2\x80\x94not than was just, but than was prudent, especially in the\r\ncase of one little accustomed to strong censure.  Indeed Clarence could\r\nnot restrain a slight groan when he perceived that our mother was shut up\r\nin the study to assist in the composition.  Her denunciations always\r\noutran my father\xe2\x80\x99s, and her pain showed itself in bitterness.  \xe2\x80\x98I ought\r\nto have had the presence of mind to refuse to show the letter,\xe2\x80\x99 he said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Griff will hardly forgive me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEllen looked very thin, and with a transparent delicacy of complexion.\r\nShe had greatly grieved over her grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s illness and the first\r\nchange in her happy home; and she must have been much disappointed at\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x99s absence.  Emily dreaded her mention of the subject when they\r\nfirst met.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said my sister, \xe2\x80\x98she said no word of him.  All she cared to tell\r\nme was of the talks she had with her grandfather, when he made her read\r\nhis favourite chapters in the Bible; and though he had no memory for\r\noutside things, his thoughts were as beautiful as ever.  Sometimes his\r\nface grew so full of glad contemplation that she felt quite awestruck, as\r\nif it were becoming like the face of an angel.  It made her realise, she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9chow little the ups and downs of this life matter, if there can be\r\nsuch peace at the last.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, after all, I could not help thinking that\r\nit was better perhaps that Griff did not come.  Any other sort of talk\r\nwould have jarred on her just now, and you know he would never stand much\r\nof that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMuch as we loved our Griff, we had come to the perception that Ellen was\r\na treasure he could not esteem properly.\r\n\r\nThe Lester cousins, never remarkable for good taste, forced on her the\r\nknowledge of his employment.  Her father could not refrain from telling\r\nus that her exclamation had been, \xe2\x80\x98Poor Griff, how shocked he must be!\r\nHe was so fond of dear grandpapa.  Pray, papa, get Mr. Winslow to let him\r\nknow that I am not hurt, for I know he could not help it.  Or may I ask\r\nEmily to tell him so?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI wish Mrs. Fordyce would have absolved her from the promise not to\r\nmention Griff to us.  That innocent reliance might have touched him, as\r\nEmily would have narrated it; but it only rendered my father more\r\nindignant, and more resolved to reserve the message till a repentant\r\napology should come.  And, alas! none ever came.  Just wrath on a\r\nvoiceless paper has little effect.  There is reason to believe that Griff\r\ndid not like the air of my father\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and never even read it.  He\r\ndiligently avoided Clarence, and the pain and shame his warm heart must\r\nhave felt only made him keep out of reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nFACILIS DESCENSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98The slippery verge her feet beguiled;\r\n       She tumbled headlong in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                     GRAY.\r\n\r\nONE of Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s briefest notes in his largest hand announced that he\r\nhad accepted various invitations to country houses, for cricket matches,\r\narchery meetings, and the like; nor did he even make it clear where his\r\naddress would be, except that he would be with a friend in Scotland when\r\ngrouse-shooting began.\r\n\r\nClarence, however, came home for a brief holiday.  He was startled at the\r\nfirst sight of Ellen.  He said she was indeed lovelier than ever, with an\r\nadded sweetness in her clear eyes and the wild rose flush in her delicate\r\ncheek; but that she looked as if she was being refined away to nothing,\r\nand was more than ever like the vision with the lamp.\r\n\r\nOf course the Fordyces had not been going into society, though Ellen and\r\nEmily were as much together as before, helping one another in practising\r\ntheir school children in singing, and sharing in one another\xe2\x80\x99s studies\r\nand pursuits.  There had been in the spring a change at Wattlesea; the\r\nold incumbent died, and the new one was well reported of as a very\r\nearnest hardworking man.  He seemed to be provided with a large family,\r\nand there was no driving into Wattlesea without seeing members of it\r\nscattered about the place.\r\n\r\nThe Fordyces being anxious to show them attention without a regular\r\ndinner-party, decided on inviting all the family to keep Anne\xe2\x80\x99s ninth\r\nbirthday, and Emily and Martyn were of course to come and assist at the\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of the day fixed that a letter came to me whose\r\ncontents seemed to burn themselves into my brain.  Martyn called across\r\nthe breakfast-table, \xe2\x80\x98Look at Edward!  Has any one sent you a young\r\nbasilisk?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wish it was,\xe2\x80\x99 I gasped out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t look so,\xe2\x80\x99 entreated Emily.  \xe2\x80\x98Tell us!  Is it Griff?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not ill-hurt?\xe2\x80\x99 cried my mother.  \xe2\x80\x98Oh no, no.  Worse!\xe2\x80\x99 and then somehow I\r\narticulated that he was married; and Clarence exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Not the\r\nPeacock!\xe2\x80\x99 and at my gesture my father broke out.  \xe2\x80\x98He has done for\r\nhimself, the unhappy boy.  A disgraceful Scotch marriage.  Eh?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was his sense of honour,\xe2\x80\x99 I managed to utter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sense of fiddlestick!\xe2\x80\x99 said my poor father.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t stop to excuse him.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had enough of that!  Let us hear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI cannot give a copy of the letter.  It was so painful that it was\r\ndestroyed; for there was a tone of bravado betraying his uneasiness, but\r\naltogether unbecoming.  All that it disclosed was, that some one staying\r\nin the same house had paid insulting attentions to Lady Peacock; she had\r\nthrown herself on our brother\xe2\x80\x99s protection, and after interfering on her\r\nbehalf, he had found that there was no means of sheltering her but by\r\nmaking her his wife.  This had been effected by the assistance of the\r\nlady of the house where they had been staying; and Griffith had written\r\nto me two days later from Edinburgh, declaring that Selina had only to be\r\nknown to be loved, and to overcome all prejudices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prejudices,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father bitterly.  \xe2\x80\x98Prejudices in favour of truth\r\nand honour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd my mother uttered the worst reproach of all, when in my agitation, I\r\nslipped and almost fell in rising\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh, my poor Edward! that I should have\r\nlived to think yours the least misfortune that has befallen my sons!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, putting Martyn toward her, \xe2\x80\x98here is one to\r\nmake up for us all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clarence,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, \xe2\x80\x98your mother did not mean anything but that\r\nyou and Edward are the comfort of our lives.  I wish there were a chance\r\nof Griffith redeeming the past as you have done; but I see no hope of\r\nthat.  A man is never ruined till he is married.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt that moment there was a step in the hall, a knock at the door, and\r\nthere stood Mr. Frank Fordyce.  He looked at us and said, \xe2\x80\x98It is true\r\nthen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To our shame and sorrow it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father.  \xe2\x80\x98Fordyce, how can we\r\nlook you in the face?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As my dear good friend, and my father\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x99 said the kind man, shaking him\r\nby the hand heartily.  \xe2\x80\x98Do you think we could blame you for this youth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconduct?  Stay\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94for we young ones were about to leave the room.  \xe2\x80\x98My poor\r\ngirl knows nothing yet.  Her mother luckily got the letter in her\r\nbedroom.  We can\xe2\x80\x99t put off the Reynoldses, you know, so I came to ask the\r\nyoung people to come up as if nothing had happened, and then Ellen need\r\nknow nothing till the day is over.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I can,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can be capable of self-command, I hope,\xe2\x80\x99 said my mother severely,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98or you do not deserve to be called a friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSuch speeches might not be pleasant, but they were bracing, and we all\r\nwithdrew to leave the elders to talk it over together, when, as I\r\nbelieve, kind Parson Frank was chiefly concerned to argue my parents out\r\nof their shame and humiliation.\r\n\r\nClarence told us what he knew or guessed; and we afterwards understood\r\nthe matter to have come about chiefly through poor Griff\xe2\x80\x99s weakness of\r\ncharacter, and love of amusement and flattery.  The boyish flirtation\r\nwith Selina Clarkson had never entirely died away, though it had been\r\nnothing more than the elder woman\xe2\x80\x99s bantering patronage and easy\r\nacceptance of the youth\xe2\x80\x99s equally gay, jesting admiration.  It had,\r\nhowever, involved some raillery on his attachment to the little\r\nMethodistical country girl, and this gradually grew into jealousy of\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94especially as Griff became more of a man, and a brilliant member of\r\nsociety.  The detention from the funeral had been a real victory on the\r\nwidow\xe2\x80\x99s part, and the few times when Clarence had seen them together he\r\nhad been dismayed at the _cavaliere serviente_ terms on which Griff\r\nseemed to stand; but his words of warning were laughed down.  The rest\r\nwas easy to gather.  He had gone about on the round of visits almost as\r\nan appendage to Lady Peacock, till they came to a free and easy house,\r\nwhere her coquetry and love of admiration brought on one of those\r\ndisputes which rendered his championship needful; and such defence could\r\nonly have one conclusion, especially in Scotland, where hasty private\r\nmarriages were still legal.  What an exchange!  Only had Griff ever\r\ncomprehended the worth of his treasure?\r\n\r\nEmily went as late as she could, that there might be the less chance of a\r\nt\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate, in which she might be surprised into a betrayal of her\r\nsecret: indeed she only started at last when Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s impatience had\r\nbecome intolerable.\r\n\r\nWhat was our amazement when, much earlier than we expected, we saw Mr.\r\nFordyce driving up in his phaeton, and heard the story he had to tell.\r\n\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s delay had succeeded in bringing her only just in time for the\r\nluncheon that was to be the children\xe2\x80\x99s dinner.  There was a keen-looking,\r\nactive, sallow clergyman, grizzled, and with an air of having seen much\r\nservice; a pale, worn wife, with a gentle, sensible face; and a\r\nbewildering flock of boys and girls, all apparently under the command of\r\na very brisk, effective-looking elder sister of fourteen or fifteen, who\r\nseemed to be the readiest authority, and to decide what and how much each\r\nmight partake of, among delicacies, evidently rare novelties.\r\n\r\nThe day was late in August.  The summer had broken; there had been rain,\r\nand, though fine, the temperature was fitter for active sports than\r\nanything else.  Croquet was not yet invented, and, besides, most of the\r\nparty were of the age for regular games at play.  Ellen and Emily did\r\ntheir part in starting these\xe2\x80\x94finding, however, that the Reynolds boys\r\nwere rather rough, in spite of the objurgations of their sister, who\r\nevidently thought herself quite beyond the age for romps.  The sports led\r\nthem to the great home-field on the opposite slope of the ridge from our\r\nown.  The new farm-buildings were on the level ground at the bottom to\r\nthe right, where the declivity was much more gradual than to the left,\r\nwhich was very steep, and ended in furze bushes and low copsewood.  It\r\nwas voted a splendid place for hide-and-seek, and the game was soon in\r\nsuch full career that Ellen, who had had quite running enough, could fall\r\nout of it, and with her, the other two elder girls.  Emily felt Fanny\r\nReynolds\xe2\x80\x99 presence a sort of protection, \xe2\x80\x98little guessing what she was up\r\nto,\xe2\x80\x99 to use her own expression.  Perhaps the girl had not earlier made\r\nout who Emily was, or she had been too much absorbed in her cares; but,\r\nas the three sat resting on a stump overlooking the hill, she was\r\nprompted by the singular inopportuneness of precocious fourteen to\r\nobserve, \xe2\x80\x98I ought to have congratulated you, Miss Winslow.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEmily gabbled out, \xe2\x80\x98Thank you, never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 hoping thus to put a stop to\r\nwhatever might be coming; but there was no such good fortune.  \xe2\x80\x98We saw it\r\nin the paper.  It is your brother, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 asked unsuspicious Ellen, thinking, no doubt, of some fresh glory\r\nto Griffith.\r\n\r\nAnd before Emily could utter a word, if there were any she could have\r\nuttered, out it came.  \xe2\x80\x98The marriage\xe2\x80\x94John Griffith Winslow, Esquire,\r\neldest son of John Edward Winslow of Chantry House, to Selina, relict of\r\nSir Henry Peacock and daughter of George Clarkson, Esquire, Q.C.  I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think it could be you at first, because you would have been at the\r\nwedding.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEmily had not even time to meet Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s eyes before they were startled by\r\na shriek that was not the merry \xe2\x80\x98whoop\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98I spy\xe2\x80\x99 of the game, and,\r\nspringing up, the girls saw little Anne Fordyce rushing headlong down the\r\nvery steepest part of the slope, just where it ended in an extremely\r\nmuddy pool, the watering-place of the cattle.  The child was totally\r\nunable to stop herself, and so was Martyn, who was dashing after her.\r\nNot a word was said, though, perhaps, there was a shriek or two, but the\r\nelder sisters flew with one accord towards the pond.  They also were some\r\nway above it, but at some distance off, so that the descent was not so\r\nperpendicular, and they could guard against over-running themselves.\r\nEllen, perhaps from knowing the ground better, was far before the other\r\ntwo; but already poor little Anne had gone straight down, and fallen flat\r\non her face in the water, Martyn after her, perhaps with a little more\r\nfree will, for, though he too fell, he was already struggling to lift\r\nAnne up, and had her head above water, when Ellen arrived and dashed in\r\nto assist.\r\n\r\nThe pond began by being shallow, but the bottom sloped down into a deep\r\nhollow, and was besides covered several feet deep with heavy\r\ncattle-trodden mire and weeds, in which it was almost impossible to gain\r\na footing, or to move.  By the time Emily and Miss Reynolds had come to\r\nthe brink, Ellen and Martyn were standing up in the water, leaning\r\nagainst one another, and holding poor little Anne\xe2\x80\x99s head up\xe2\x80\x94all they\r\ncould do.  Ellen called out, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t! don\xe2\x80\x99t come in!  Call some one!  The\r\nfarm!  We are sinking in!  You can\xe2\x80\x99t help!  Call\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe danger was really terrible of their sinking in the mud and weeds, and\r\nbeing sucked into the deep part of the pool, and they were too far in to\r\nbe reached from the bank.  Emily perceived this, and ran as she had never\r\nrun before, happily meeting on the way with the gentlemen, who had been\r\ninspecting the new model farm-buildings, and had already taken alarm from\r\nthe screams.\r\n\r\nThey found the three still with their heads above water, but no more, for\r\nevery struggle to get up the slope only plunged them deeper in the\r\nhorrible mud.  Moreover, Fanny Reynolds was up to her ankles in the mud,\r\nholding by one of her brothers, but unable to reach Martyn.  It seems she\r\nhad had some idea of forming a chain of hands to pull the others out.\r\n\r\nEven now the rescue was not too easy.  Mr. Fordyce hurried in, and took\r\nAnne in his arms; but, even with his height and strength, he found his\r\nfeet slipping away under him, and could only hand the little insensible\r\ngirl to Mr. Reynolds, bidding him carry her at once to the house, while\r\nhe lifted Martyn up only just in time, and Ellen clung to him.  Thus\r\nweighted, he could not get out, till the bailiff and another man had\r\nbrought some faggots and a gate that were happily near at hand, and\r\nhelped him to drag the two out, perfectly exhausted, and Martyn hardly\r\nconscious.  They both were carried to the Rectory,\xe2\x80\x94Ellen by her father,\r\nMartyn by the foreman,\xe2\x80\x94and they were met at the door by the tidings that\r\nlittle Anne was coming to herself.\r\n\r\nIndeed, by the time Mr. Fordyce had put on dry clothes, all three were\r\nsafe in warm beds, and quite themselves again, so that he trusted that no\r\nmischief was done; though he decided upon fetching my mother to satisfy\r\nherself about Martyn.  However, a ducking was not much to a healthy\r\nfellow like Martyn, and my mother found him quite fit to dress himself in\r\nthe clothes she brought, and to return home with her.  Both the girls\r\nwere asleep, but Ellen had had a shivering fit, and her mother was with\r\nher, and was anxious.  Emily told her mother of Fanny Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99\r\nunfortunate speech, and it was thought right to mention it.  Mrs. Fordyce\r\nlistened kindly, kissed Emily, and told her not to be distressed, for\r\npossibly it might turn out to have been the best thing for Ellen to have\r\nlearnt the fact at such a moment; and, at any rate, it had spared her\r\nparents some doubt and difficulty as to the communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nWALY, WALY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98And am I then forgot, forgot?\r\n    It broke the heart of Ellen!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                 CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE and Martyn walked over to Hillside the first thing the next\r\nmorning to inquire for the two sisters.  As to one, they were quickly\r\nreassured, for Anne was in the porch feeding the doves, and no sooner did\r\nshe see them than out she flew, and was clinging round Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s neck, her\r\nhat falling back as she kissed him on both cheeks, with an eagerness that\r\nmade him, as Clarence reported, turn the colour of a lobster, and look\r\nshy, not to say sheepish, while she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98 Oh, Martyn! mamma says\r\nshe never thanked you, for you really and truly did save my life, and I\r\nam so glad it was you\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It was not I, it was Ellen,\xe2\x80\x99 gruffly muttered Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes! but papa says I should have been smothered in that horrid mud,\r\nbefore Ellen could get to me if you had not pulled me up directly.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe elders came out by this time, and Clarence was able to get in his\r\ninquiry.  Ellen had had a feverish night, and her chest seemed oppressed,\r\nbut her mother did not think her seriously ill.  Once she had asked, \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nit true, what Fanny Reynolds said?\xe2\x80\x99 and on being answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, my dear,\r\nI am afraid it is,\xe2\x80\x99 she had said no more; and as the Fordyce habit of\r\ntreating colds was with sedatives, her mother thought her scarcely awake\r\nto the full meaning of the tidings, and hoped to prevent her dwelling on\r\nthem till she had recovered the physical shock.  Having answered these\r\ninquiries, the two parents turned upon Martyn, who, in an access of\r\nshamefacedness, had crept behind Clarence and a great orange-tree, and\r\nwas thence pulled out by Anne\xe2\x80\x99s vigorous efforts.  The full story had\r\ncome to light.  The Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 boys had grown boisterous as soon as the\r\nrestraint of the young ladies\xe2\x80\x99 participation had been removed, and had,\r\nwhether intentionally or not, terrified little Anne in the chases of\r\nhide-and-seek.  Finally, one of them had probably been unable to\r\nwithstand the temptation of seeing her timid nervous way of peeping and\r\nprying about; and had, without waiting to be properly found, leapt out of\r\nhis lair with a roar that scared the little girl nearly out of her wits,\r\nand sent her flying, she knew not whither.  Martyn was a few steps\r\nbehind, only not holding her hand, because the other children had derided\r\nher for clinging to his protection.  He had instantly seen where she was\r\ngoing, and shouted to her to stop and take care; but she was past\r\nattending to him, and he had no choice but to dart after her, seeing what\r\nwas inevitable; while George Reynolds had sense to stop in time, and seek\r\na safer descent.  Had Martyn not been there to raise the child instantly\r\nfrom the stifling mud, her sister could hardly have been in time to save\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fordyce tearfully kissed him; her husband called him a little hero,\r\nas if in joke, then gravely blessed him; and he looked, Clarence related,\r\nas if he had been in the greatest possible disgrace.\r\n\r\nIt was the second time that one of us had saved a life from drowning, but\r\nthere was none of the exultation we had felt that time before in London.\r\nIt was a much graver feeling, where the danger had really been greater,\r\nand the rescue had been of one so dear to us.  It was tempered likewise\r\nby anxiety about our dear Ellen\xe2\x80\x94ours, alas, no longer!  She was laid up\r\nfor several days, and it was thought better that she should not see Emily\r\ntill she had recovered; but after a week had passed, her father drove\r\nover to discuss some plans for the Poor-Law arrangements, and begged my\r\nsister to go back in the carriage and spend the day with his daughter.\r\n\r\nWe brothers could now look forward to some real intelligence; we became\r\nrestless; and in the afternoon Clarence and I set out with the\r\ndonkey-chair on the woodland path to meet Emily.  We gained more than we\r\nhad hoped, for as we came round one of the turns in the winding path, up\r\nthe hanging beech-wood, we came on the two friends\xe2\x80\x94Ellen, a truly\r\nUna-like figure, in her white dress with her black scarf making a sable\r\nstole.  Perhaps we betrayed some confusion, for there was a bright flush\r\non her cheeks as she came towards us, and, standing straight up, said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clarence, Edward, I am so glad you are here; I wanted to see you.  I\r\nwanted\xe2\x80\x94to say\xe2\x80\x94I know he could not help it.  It was his generosity\xe2\x80\x94helping\r\nthose that need it; and\xe2\x80\x94and\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m not angry.  And though that\xe2\x80\x99s all over,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll always be my brothers, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe held her outstretched hands to us both.  I could not help it, I drew\r\nher down, and kissed her brow; Clarence clasped her other hand and held\r\nit to his lips, but neither of us could utter a word.\r\n\r\nShe turned back and went quietly away through the wood, while Emily sank\r\ndown under the beech-tree in a paroxysm of grief.  You may see which it\r\nwas, for Clarence cut out \xe2\x80\x98E. M. F., 1835\xe2\x80\x99 upon the bark.  He soothed and\r\ncaressed poor Emily as in old nursery troubles; and presently she told us\r\nthat it would be long before we saw that dear one again, for Mrs. Fordyce\r\nwas going to take her away on the morrow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fordyce had seen Emily in private, before letting her go to Ellen.\r\nThere was evidently a great wish to be kind.  Mrs. Fordyce said she could\r\nnever forget what she owed to us all, and could not think of blaming any\r\nof us.  \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98you are a sensible girl, Emily,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98how I hate\r\nbeing called a sensible girl,\xe2\x80\x99 observed the poor child, in\r\nparenthesis,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98and you must see that it is desirable not to encourage her\r\nto indulge in needless discussion after she once understands the facts.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe added that she thought a cessation of present intercourse would be\r\nwise till the sore was in some degree healed.  She had not been satisfied\r\nabout her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s health for some time, and meant to take her to Bath\r\nthe next day to consult a physician, and then decide what would be best.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And, my dear,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98if there should be a slackening of\r\ncorrespondence, do not take it as unkindness, but as a token that my poor\r\nchild is recovering her tone.  Do not discontinue writing to her, but be\r\nguarded, and perhaps less rapid, in replying.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt was for her friendship that poor Emily wept so bitterly\xe2\x80\x94the first\r\nfriendship that had been an enthusiasm to her; looking at it as a cruel\r\ninjustice that Griff\xe2\x80\x99s misdoing should separate them.  The prediction\r\nthat all might be lived down and forgotten was too vague and distant to\r\nbe much consolation; indeed, we were too young to take it in.\r\n\r\nWe had it all over again in a somewhat grotesque form when, at another\r\nturn in the wood, we came upon Martyn and Anne, loaded with treasures\r\nfrom their robbers\xe2\x80\x99 cave, some of which were bestowed in my chair, the\r\nothers carried off between Anne and her not very willing nursery-maid.\r\n\r\nAnne kissed us all round, and augured cheerfully that she should lay up a\r\nstore of shells and rocks by the seaside to make \xe2\x80\x98a perfect Robinson\r\nCrusoe cavern,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and then Clarence can come and be the\r\nSpaniards and the savages.  But that won\xe2\x80\x99t be till next summer,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nadded, shaking her head.  \xe2\x80\x98I shall get Ellen to tell Emily what shells I\r\nfind, and then she can tell Martyn; for mamma says girls never write to\r\nboys unless they are their brothers!  And now Martyn will never be my\r\nbrother,\xe2\x80\x99 she added ruefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will always be our darling,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as your sister,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered.  However, amid\r\nauguries of the combination of robbers and Robinson Crusoe, the parting\r\nwas effected, and Anne borne off by the maid; while we had Martyn on our\r\nhands, stamping about and declaring that it was very hard that because\r\nGriff chose to be a faithless, inconstant ruffian, all his pleasure and\r\ncomfort in life should be stopped!  He said such outrageous things that,\r\nbetween scolding him and laughing at him, Emily had been somewhat cheered\r\nby the time we reached the house.\r\n\r\nMy father had written to Griffith, in his first displeasure, curt wishes\r\nthat he might not have reason to repent of the step he had taken, though\r\nhe had not gone the right way to obtain a blessing.  As it was not\r\nsuitable that a man should be totally dependent on his wife, his\r\nallowance should be continued; but under present circumstances he must\r\nperceive that he and Lady Peacock could not be received at Chantry House.\r\nWe were shown the letter, and thought it terribly brief and cold; but my\r\nmother said it would be weak to offer forgiveness that was not sought,\r\nand my father was specially exasperated at the absence of all contrition\r\nas to the treatment of Ellen.  All Griff had vouchsafed on that head\r\nwas\xe2\x80\x94the rupture had been the Fordyces\xe2\x80\x99 doing; he was not bound.  As to\r\nintercourse with him, Clarence and I might act as we saw fit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only,\xe2\x80\x99 said my father, as Clarence was leaving home, \xe2\x80\x98I trust you not to\r\nget yourself involved in this set.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence gave a queer smile, \xe2\x80\x98They would not take me as a gift, papa.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd as my father turned from the hall door, he laid his hand on his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s arm, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Who would have told us what that young fellow\r\nwould be to us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe sighed, and said, \xe2\x80\x98He is not twenty-three; he has plenty of money,\r\nand is very fond of Griff.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nTHE RIVER\xe2\x80\x99S BANK.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98And my friend rose up in the shadows,\r\n       And turned to me,\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBe of good cheer,\xe2\x80\x9d I said faintly,\r\n       For He called thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                     B. M.\r\n\r\nMR. FORDYCE waited at Hillside till after Sunday, and then went to Bath\r\nto hear the verdict of the physician.  He returned as much depressed as\r\nit was in his sanguine nature to be, for great delicacy of the lungs had\r\nbeen detected; and to prevent the recent chill from leaving permanent\r\ninjury, Ellen must have a winter abroad, and warm sea or mountain air at\r\nonce.  Whether the disease were constitutional and would have come on at\r\nall events no one could tell.\r\n\r\nConsumption was much less understood half a century ago; codliver oil was\r\nunknown; and stethoscopes were new inventions, only used by the more\r\nadvanced of the faculty.  The only escape poor Parson Frank had from\r\naccepting the doom was in disbelieving that a thing like a trumpet could\r\nreally reveal the condition of the chest.  Moreover, Mrs. Fordyce had had\r\na brother who had, under the famous cowhouse cure, recovered enough to\r\nreturn home, and be killed by the upsetting of a stage coach.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fordyce took her daughter to Lyme, and waited there till her husband\r\nhad found a curate and made all arrangements.  It must have been very\r\ninconvenient not to come home; but, no doubt, she wanted to prevent any\r\nmore partings.  Then they went abroad, travelling slowly, and seeing all\r\nthe sights that came in their way, to distract Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts.  She was\r\nnot allowed to hear what ailed her; but believed her languor and want of\r\ninterest in everything to be the effect of the blow she had received,\r\nstruggling to exert herself, and to enter gratefully into the enjoyments\r\nprovided for her.  She was not prevented from writing to Emily; indeed,\r\nno one liked to hinder anything she wished, but they were guide-book\r\nletters, describing all she saw as a kind of duty, but scarcely\r\nconcealing the trouble it was to look.  Such sentences would slip out as\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is a nice quiet place, and I am happy to say there is nothing that\r\none ought to see.\xe2\x80\x99  Or, \xe2\x80\x98I sat in the cathedral at Lucerne while the\r\nothers were going round.  The organ was playing, and it was such rest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nOr, again, after a day on the Lago di Como, \xe2\x80\x98It was glorious, and if you\r\nand Edward were here, perhaps the beauty would penetrate my sluggish\r\nsoul!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEllen\xe2\x80\x99s sluggish soul!\xe2\x80\x94when we remembered her keen ecstasy at the Valley\r\nof Rocks.\r\n\r\nThose letters were our chief interest in an autumn which seemed dreary to\r\nus, in spite of friendly visitors; for had not our family hope and joy\r\nbeen extinguished?  There was no direct communication with Griffith after\r\nhis unpleasant reply to my father\xe2\x80\x99s letter; but Clarence saw the newly\r\nmarried pair on their return to Lady Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s house in London, and\r\nreported that they were very kind and friendly to him, and gave him more\r\ninvitations than he could accept.  Being cross-examined when he came home\r\nfor Christmas, he declared his conviction that Lady Peacock had married\r\nGriff entirely from affection, and that he had been\xe2\x80\x94well\xe2\x80\x94flattered into\r\nit.  They seemed very fond of each other now, and were launching out into\r\nall sorts of gaieties; but though he did not tell my father, he confided\r\nto me that he feared that Griffith had been disappointed in the amount of\r\nfortune at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.\r\n\r\nIt was at that Christmas time, one night, having found an intrusive cat\r\nupon my bed, Clarence carried her out at the back door close to his room,\r\nand came back in haste and rather pale.  \xe2\x80\x98It is quite true about the lady\r\nand the light being seen out of doors,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in an awe-stricken voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have just seen her flit from the mullion room to the ruin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe only noted the fact in that ghost-diary of ours\xe2\x80\x94we told nobody, and\r\nlooked no more.  We already believed that these appearances on the lawn\r\nmust be the cause that every window, up to the attics on the garden side\r\nof the house, were so heavily shuttered and barred that there was no\r\nopening them without noise.  Indeed, those on the ground floor had in\r\naddition bells attached to them.  No doubt the former inhabitants had\r\ndone their best to prevent any one from seeing or inquiring into what was\r\nunacknowledged and unaccountable.  It might be only a coincidence, but we\r\ncould not help remarking that we had seen and heard nothing of her during\r\nthe engagement which might have united the two families; though, of\r\ncourse, it would be ridiculous to suppose her cognisant of it, like the\r\nWhite Lady of Avenel, dancing for joy at Mary\xe2\x80\x99s marriage with Halbert\r\nGlendinning.\r\n\r\nThe Fordyces had settled at Florence, where they suffered a great deal\r\nmore from cold than they would have done at Hillside; and there was such\r\na cessation of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s letters that Emily feared that Mrs. Fordyce had\r\nattained her wish and separated the friends effectually.  However, Frank\r\nFordyce beguiled his enforced leisure with long letters to my father on\r\nhome business, Austrian misgovernment, and the Italian Church and people,\r\nfull of shrewd observations and new lights; and one of these ended thus,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My poor lassie has been in bed for ten days with a severe cold.  She\r\nbegs me to say that she has begun a letter to Emily, and hopes soon to\r\nfinish it.  We had thought her gaining ground, but she is sadly pulled\r\ndown.  _Fiat voluntas_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe letter, which had been begun, never came; but, after three long\r\nweeks, there was one from the dear patient herself, mentioning her\r\nillness, and declaring that it was so comfortable to be allowed to be\r\ntired, and to go nowhere and see nothing except the fragment of beautiful\r\nblue sky, and the corner of a campanile, and the flowers Anne brought in\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she could be moved, they took her to Genoa, where she revived\r\nenough to believe that she should be well if she were at home again, and\r\nto win from her parents a promise to take her to Hillside as soon as the\r\nspring winds were over.  So anxious was she that, as soon as there was\r\nany safety in travelling, the party began moving northwards, going by sea\r\nto Marseilles to avoid the Corniche, so early in the year.  There were\r\nmany fluctuations, and it was only her earnest yearning for home and\r\nstrong resolution that could have made her parents persevere; but at last\r\nthey were at Hillside, just after Whitsuntide, in the last week of May.\r\n\r\nFrank Fordyce walked over to see us on the very evening after their\r\narrival.  He was much altered, his kindly handsome face looked almost as\r\nif he had gone through an illness; and, indeed, apart from all his\r\nanxiety and sorrow, he had pined in foreign parts for his human flock, as\r\nwell as his bullocks and his turnips.  He had also read, thought, and\r\nobserved a great deal, and had left his long boyhood behind him, during a\r\nspace for study and meditation such as he had never had before.\r\n\r\nHe was quite hopeless of his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, and made no secret of\r\nit.  In passing through London the best advice had been taken, but only\r\nto obtain the verdict that the case was beyond all skill, and that it was\r\nonly a matter of weeks, when all that could be done was to give as much\r\ngratification as possible.  The one thing that Ellen did care about was\r\nto be at home\xe2\x80\x94to have Emily with her, and once more see her school\r\nchildren, her church, and her garden.  Tired as she was she had sprung up\r\nin the carriage at the first glimpse of Hillside spire, and had leant\r\nforward at the window, nodding and smiling her greetings to all the\r\nvillagers.\r\n\r\nShe had been taken at once to her room and her bed, but her father had\r\npromised to beg Emily to come up by noon on the morrow.  Then he sat\r\ntalking of local matters, not able to help showing what infinite relief\r\nit was to him to be at home, and what music to his ears was the\r\nSomersetshire dialect and deep English voice \xe2\x80\x98after all those thin,\r\nshrill, screeching foreigners.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Emily!  It was in mingled grief and gladness that she set off the\r\nnext day, with the trepidation of one to whom sickness and decay were\r\nhitherto unknown.  When she returned, it was in a different mood, unable\r\nto believe the doctors could be right, and in the delight of having her\r\nown bright, sweet Ellen back again, all herself.  They had talked, but\r\nmore of home and village than of foreign experiences; and though Ellen\r\ndid not herself assist, she had much enjoyed watching the unpacking of\r\nthe numerous gifts which had cost a perfect fortune at the Custom House.\r\nNo one seemed forgotten\xe2\x80\x94villagers, children, servants, friends.  Some of\r\nthese tokens are before me still.  The Florentine mosaic paper-weight she\r\nbrought me presses this very sheet; the antique lamp she gave my father\r\nis on the mantelpiece; Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s engraving of Raffaelle\xe2\x80\x99s St. Michael\r\nhangs opposite to me on the wall.  Most precious in our eyes was the\r\ncollection of plants, dried and labelled by herself, which she brought to\r\nEmily and me\xe2\x80\x94poor mummies now, but redolent of undying affection.  Her\r\ndesire was to bestow all her keepsakes with her own hands, and in most\r\ncases she actually did so\xe2\x80\x94a few daily, as her strength served her.  The\r\nlittle figures in costume, coloured prints, Swiss carvings, French\r\nknicknacks, are preserved in many a Hillside cottage as treasured relics\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98our young lady.\xe2\x80\x99  Many years later, Martyn recognised a Hillside\r\nnative in a back street in London by a little purple-blue picture of\r\nVesuvius, and thereby reached the soft spot in a nearly dried-up heart.\r\n\r\nSo bright and playful was the dear girl over all her old familiar\r\ninterests that we inexperienced beings believed not only that the wound\r\nto her affections was healed, but that she either did not know or did not\r\nrealise the sentence that had been pronounced on her; but when this was\r\nrepeated to her mother, it was met by a sad smile and the reply that we\r\nonly saw her in her best hours.  Still, through the summer, it was\r\nimpossible to us to accept the truth; she looked so lovely, was so\r\ncheerful, and took such delight in all that was about her.\r\n\r\nWith the first cold, however, she seemed to shrivel up, and the bad\r\nnights extended into the days.  Emily ascribed the change to the lack of\r\ngoing out into the air, and always found reasons for the increased\r\nlanguor and weakness; till at last there came a day when my poor little\r\nsister seemed as if the truth had broken upon her for the first time,\r\nwhen Ellen talked plainly to her of their parting, and had asked us both,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98her dear brother and sister,\xe2\x80\x99 to be with her at her Communion on All\r\nSaints\xe2\x80\x99 Day.\r\n\r\nShe had written a little letter to Clarence, begging his forgiveness for\r\nhaving cut him, and treated him with the scorn which, I believe, was the\r\nchief fault that weighed upon her conscience; and, hearing my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvoice in the house, she sent a message to beg him to come and see her in\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-room\xe2\x80\x94that very window where I had first heard her\r\nvoice, refusing to come down to \xe2\x80\x98those Winslows.\xe2\x80\x99  She had sent for him\r\nto entreat him to forgive Griffith and recall the pair to Chantry House.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not now,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98but when I am gone.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy father could deny her nothing, though he showed that the sight of her\r\nmade the entreaty all the harder to him; and she pleaded, \xe2\x80\x98But you know\r\nthis was not his doing.  I never was strong, and it had begun before.\r\nOnly think how sad it would have been for him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy father would have promised anything with that wasted hand on his,\r\nthose fervent eyes gazing on him, and he told her he would have given his\r\npardon long ago, if it had been sought, as it never had been.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! perhaps he did not dare!\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98Won\xe2\x80\x99t you write when all this\r\nis over, and then you will be one family again as you used to be?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe promised, though he scarcely knew where Griffith was.  Clarence,\r\nhowever, did.  He had answered Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and it had made him ask\r\nfor a few days\xe2\x80\x99 leave of absence.  So he came down on the Saturday, and\r\nwas allowed a quarter of an hour beside Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s sofa in the Sunday\r\nevening twilight.  He brought away the calm, rapt expression I had\r\nsometimes seen on his face at church, and Ellen made a special entreaty\r\nthat he might share the morrow\xe2\x80\x99s feast.\r\n\r\nThere are some things that cannot be written of, and that was one.  Still\r\nwe had not thought the end near at hand, though on Tuesday morning a\r\nmessage was sent that Ellen was suffering and exhausted, and could not\r\nsee Emily.  It was a wild, stormy day, with fierce showers of sleet, and\r\nwe clung to the hope that consideration for my sister had prompted the\r\nmessage.  In the afternoon Clarence battled with a severe gale, made his\r\nway to Hillside, and heard that the weather affected the patient, and\r\nthat there was much bodily distress.  For one moment he saw her father,\r\nwho said in broken accents that we could only pray that the spirit might\r\nbe freed without much more suffering, \xe2\x80\x98though no doubt it is all right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore daylight, before any one in the house was up, Clarence was\r\nmounting the hill in the gusts that had done their work on the trees and\r\nwere subsiding with the darkness.  And just as he was beginning the\r\ndescent, as the sun tipped the Hillside steeple with light, he heard the\r\nknell, and counted the twenty-one for the years of our Ellen\xe2\x80\x94for ours she\r\nwill always be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somehow,\xe2\x80\x99 he told me, \xe2\x80\x98I could not help taking off my hat and giving\r\nthanks for her, and then all the drops on all the boughs began sparkling,\r\nand there was a hush on all around as if she were passing among the\r\nangels, and a thrush broke out into a regular song of jubilee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nNOT IN VAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Then cheerly to your work again,\r\n       With hearts new braced and set\r\n    To run untired love\xe2\x80\x99s blessed race,\r\n    As meet for those who face to face\r\n       Over the grave their Lord have met.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                    KEBLE.\r\n\r\nTHAT dying request could not but be held sacred, and overtures were made\r\nto Griffith, who returned an odd sort of answer, friendly and\r\naffectionate, but rather as if my father were the offending party in need\r\nof forgiveness.  He and his wife were obliged for the invitation, but\r\ncould not accept it, as they had taken a house near Melton-Mowbray for\r\nthe hunting season, and were entertaining friends.\r\n\r\nIn some ways it was disappointing, in others it was a relief, not to have\r\nthe restraint of Lady Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s presence during the last days we were to\r\nhave with the Fordyces.  For a fresh loss came upon us.  Beachharbour was\r\na fishing-village on the north-western coast, which, within the previous\r\ndecade, had sprung into importance, on the one hand as a fashionable\r\nresort, on the other as a minor port for colliers.  The living was\r\nwretchedly poor, and had been held for many years by one of the old\r\ninferior stamp of clergy, scarcely superior in habits or breeding to the\r\nfarmers, and only outliving the scandals of his youth to fall into a\r\nstate of indolent carelessness.  It was in the gift of a child, for whom\r\nSir Horace Lester was trustee, and that gentleman had written, about a\r\nfortnight before Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s death, to consult Mr. Fordyce on its disposal,\r\ndeclaring the great difficulties and deficiencies of the place, which\r\nmade it impossible to offer it to any one without considerable private\r\nmeans, and also able to attract and improve the utterly demoralised\r\npopulation.  He ended, almost in joke, by saying, \xe2\x80\x98In fact, I know no one\r\nwho could cope with the situation but yourself; I wish you could find me\r\nyour own counterpart, or come yourself in earnest.  It is just the air\r\nthat suits my sister\xe2\x80\x94bracing sea-breezes; the parsonage, though a\r\nwretched place, is well situated, and she would be all the stronger; but\r\nin poor Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s state there is no use in talking of it, and besides I\r\nknow you are wedded to your fertile fields and Somersetshire clowns.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat letter (afterwards shown to us) had worked on Mr. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s mind\r\nduring those mournful days.  He was still young enough to leave behind\r\nhim Parson Frank and the \xe2\x80\x98squarson\xe2\x80\x99 habits of Hillside in which he had\r\ngrown up; and the higher and more spiritual side of his nature had been\r\nfostered by the impressions of the last year.  He was conscious, as he\r\nsaid, that his talk had been overmuch of bullocks, and that his farm had\r\nengrossed him more than he wished should happen again, though a change\r\nwould be tearing himself up by the roots; and as to his own people at\r\nHillside, the curate, an active young man, had well supplied his place,\r\nand, in his _truly_ humble opinion, though by no means in theirs,\r\nintroduced several improvements even in that model parish.\r\n\r\nWhat had moved him most, however, was a conversation he had had with\r\nEllen, with whom during this last year he had often held deep and serious\r\ncounsel, with a growing reverence on his side.  He had read her uncle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter to her, and to his great surprise found that she looked on it as a\r\ncall.  Devotedly fond as she herself was of Hillside, she could see that\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s abilities were wasted on so small a field, in a manner\r\nscarcely good for himself, and she had been struck with the greater force\r\nof his sermons when preaching to educated congregations abroad.  If no\r\none else could or would take efficient charge of these Beachharbour\r\nsouls, she could see that it would weigh on his conscience to take\r\ncomparative ease in his own beloved meadows, among a flock almost his\r\nvassals.  Moreover, she relieved his mind about her mother.  She had\r\ndiscovered, what the good wife kept out of sight, that the north-country\r\nwoman never could entirely have affinities with the south, and she had\r\ncome to the conclusion that Mrs. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s spirits would be heavily tried\r\nby settling down at Hillside in the altered state of things.\r\n\r\nAfter this talk, Mr. Fordyce had suggested a possible incumbent to his\r\nbrother-in-law, but left the matter open; and when Sir Horace came down\r\nto the funeral, it was more thoroughly discussed; and, as soon as Mrs.\r\nFordyce saw that departure would not break her husband\xe2\x80\x99s heart, she made\r\nno secret of the way that both her opinion and her inclinations lay.  She\r\ntold my mother that she had always believed her own ill-health was caused\r\nby the southern climate, and that she hoped that Anne would grow up\r\nstronger than her sister in the northern breezes.\r\n\r\nPoor little Anne!  Of all the family, to her the change was the greatest\r\ngrief.  The tour on the Continent had been a dull affair to her; she was\r\nof the age to weary of long confinement in the carriage and in strange\r\nhotels, and too young to appreciate \xe2\x80\x98grown-up\xe2\x80\x99 sights.  Picture-galleries\r\nand cathedrals were only a drag to her, and if the experiences that were\r\nput into Rosella\xe2\x80\x99s mouth for the benefit of her untravelled sisters could\r\nhave been written down, they would have been as unconventional as Mark\r\nTwain\xe2\x80\x99s adventures.  Rosella went through the whole tour, and left a leg\r\nbehind in the hinge of a door, but in compensation brought home a Paris\r\nbonnet and mantle.  She seemed to have been her young mistress\xe2\x80\x99s chief\r\ncomfort, next to an occasional game of play with her father, or a walk,\r\nlooking in at the shop windows and watching marionettes, or, still\r\nbetter, the wonderful sports of brown-legged street children, without\r\ntrying to make her speak French or Italian\xe2\x80\x94in her eyes one of the\r\ninflictions of the journey, in those of her elders the one benefit she\r\nmight gain.  She had missed the petting to which she had been accustomed\r\nfrom her grandfather and from all of us; and she had absolutely counted\r\nthe days till she could get home again, and had fallen into dire disgrace\r\nfor fits of crying when Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s weakness caused delays.  Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nholidays had been a time of rapture to her, for there was no one to\r\nattend much to her at home, and she was too young to enter into the\r\nweight of anxiety; so the two had run as wild together as a gracious\r\nwell-trained damsel of ten and a fourteen-year-old boy with tender\r\nchivalry awake in him could well do.  To be out of the way was all that\r\nwas asked of her for the time, and all old delights, such as the robbers\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncave, were renewed with fresh zest.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98It was the sweetest and the last.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd though Martyn was gone back to school, the child felt the wrench from\r\nhome most severely.  As she told me on one of those sorrowful days, \xe2\x80\x98She\r\ndid think she had come back to live at dear, dear little Hillside all the\r\ndays of her life.\xe2\x80\x99  Poor child, we became convinced that this vehement\r\nattachment to Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s brothers was one factor in Mrs. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s desire\r\nto make a change that should break off these habits of intimacy and\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\nPluralities had not become illegal, and Frank Fordyce, being still the\r\nchief landholder in Hillside, and wishing to keep up his connection with\r\nhis people, did not resign the rectory, though he put the curate into the\r\nhouse, and let the farm.  Once or twice a year he came to fulfil some of\r\na landlord\xe2\x80\x99s duties, and was as genial and affectionate as ever, but more\r\nand more absorbed in the needs of Beachharbour, and unconsciously showing\r\nhis own growth in devotion and activity; while he brought his splendid\r\nhealth and vigour, his talent, his wealth, and, above all, his winning\r\ncharm of manner and address, to that magnificent work at Beachharbour,\r\nwell known to all of you; though, perhaps, you never guessed that the\r\nfoundation of all those churches and their grand dependent works of\r\npiety, mercy, and beneficence was laid in one young girl\xe2\x80\x99s grave.  I\r\nnever heard of a fresh achievement there without remembering how the\r\nfuneral psalm ends with\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Prosper Thou the work of our hands upon us,\r\n    O prosper Thou our handiwork.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Emily?  Her drooping after the loss of her friend was sad, but it\r\nwould have been sadder but for the spirit Ellen had infused.  We found\r\nthe herbs to heal our woe round our pathway, though the first joyousness\r\nof life had departed.  The reports Mr. Henderson and the Hillside curate\r\nbrought from Oxford were great excitements to us, and we thought and\r\npuzzled over church doctrine, and tried to impart it to our scholars.  We\r\nI say, for Henderson had made me take a lads\xe2\x80\x99 class, which has been the\r\nchief interest of my life.  Even the roughest were good to their helpless\r\nteacher, and some men, as gray-headed as myself, still come every Sunday\r\nto read with Mr. Edward, and are among the most faithful friends of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nGRIFF\xe2\x80\x99S BIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Shall such mean little creatures pretend to the fashion?\r\n    Cousin Turkey Cock, well may you be in a passion.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                    _The Peacock at Home_.\r\n\r\nIT was not till the second Christmas after dear Ellen Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s death\r\nthat my eldest brother brought his wife and child to Chantry House, after\r\nan urgent letter to Lady Peacock from my mother, who yearned for a sight\r\nof Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to dwell on that visit.  Selina, or Griff\xe2\x80\x99s bird, as Martyn\r\nchose to term her, was certainly handsome and stylish; but her complexion\r\nhad lost freshness and delicacy, and the ladies said her colour was\r\nrouge, and her fine figure due to other female mysteries.  She meant to\r\nbe very gracious, and patronised everybody, especially Emily, who, she\r\nsaid, would be quite striking if not sacrificed by her dress, and whom\r\nshe much wished to take to London, engaging to provide her with a husband\r\nbefore the season was over, not for a moment believing my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nassurance that it would be a trial to us all whenever we had to resign\r\nour Emily.  Nay, she tried to condole with the poor moped family slave,\r\nand was received with such hot indignation as made her laugh, for, to do\r\nher justice, she was good-natured and easy-tempered.  However, I saw less\r\nof her than did the others, for I believe she thought the sight of me\r\nmade her ill.  Griff, poor old fellow, was heartily glad to be with us\r\nagain, but quite under her dominion.  He had lost his glow of youth and\r\ngrace of figure, his complexion had reddened, and no one would have\r\nguessed him only a year older than Clarence, whose shoulders did indeed\r\nreveal something of the desk, but whose features, though pale, were still\r\nfair and youthful.  The boy was another Clarence, not so much in\r\ncompliment to his godfather as because it was the most elegant name in\r\nthe family, and favoured an interesting belief, current among his\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s friends, that the king had actually stood sponsor to the uncle.\r\nPoor little man, his grandmother shut herself into the bookroom and\r\ncried, after her first sight of him.  He was a wretched, pinched morsel\r\nof humanity, though mamma and Emily detected wonderful resemblances; I\r\nnever saw them, but then he inherited his mother\xe2\x80\x99s repulsion towards me,\r\nand roared doubly at the sight of me.  My mother held that he was the\r\nvictim of Selina\xe2\x80\x99s dissipations and mismanagement of herself and him, and\r\ngave many matronly groans at his treatment by the smart, flighty nurse,\r\nwho waged one continual warfare with the household.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to absolute supremacy in domestic matters, it was very hard\r\nfor my mother to have her counsels and experience set at naught, and, if\r\nshe appealed to Griff, to find her notions treated with the polite\r\ndeference he might have shown to a cottage dame.\r\n\r\nA course of dinner-parties could not hinder her ladyship from finding\r\nChantry House insufferably dull, \xe2\x80\x98always like Sunday;\xe2\x80\x99 and, when she\r\nfound that we were given to Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Day services, her pity and\r\nastonishment knew no bounds.  \xe2\x80\x98It was all very well for a poor object\r\nlike Edward,\xe2\x80\x99 she held, \xe2\x80\x98but as to Mr. Winslow and Clarence, did they go\r\nfor the sake of example?  Though, to be sure, Clarence might be a Papist\r\nany day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPopery, instead of Methodism, was just beginning to be the bugbear set up\r\nfor those whom the world held to be ultra-religious, and my mother was so\r\nfar disturbed at our interest in what was termed Oxford theology that the\r\nwarning would have alarmed her if it had come from any other quarter.\r\nHowever, Lady Peacock was rather fond of Clarence, and entertained him\r\nwith schemes for improving Chantry House when it should have descended to\r\nGriffith.  The mullion rooms were her special aversion, and were all to\r\nbe swept away, together with the vaultings and the ruin\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98enough to give\r\none the blues, if there were nothing else,\xe2\x80\x99 she averred.\r\n\r\nWe really felt it to the credit of our country that Sir George Eastwood\r\nsent an invitation to an early dance to please his young daughters; and\r\nfor this our visitors prolonged their stay.  My mother made Clarence go,\r\nthat she might have some one to take care of her and Emily, since Griff\r\nwas sure to be absorbed by his lady.  Emily had not been to a ball since\r\nthose gay days in London with Ellen.  She shrank back from the contrast,\r\nand would have begged off; but she was told that she must submit; and\r\nthough she said she felt immeasurably older than at that happy time, I\r\nbelieve she was not above being pleased with the pale pink satin dress\r\nand wreath of white jessamine, which my father presented to her, and in\r\nwhich, according to Martyn, she beat \xe2\x80\x98Griff\xe2\x80\x99s bird all to shivers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence had grown much less bashful and embarrassed since the Tooke\r\naffair had given him a kind of position and a sense of not being a\r\ngeneral disgrace.  He really was younger in some ways at five-and-twenty\r\nthan at eighteen; he enjoyed dancing, and especially enjoyed the\r\ncompliments upon our sister, whom in our usual fashion we viewed as the\r\nbelle of the ball.  He was standing by my fire, telling me the various\r\nhumours of the night, when a succession of shrieks ran through the house.\r\nHe dashed away to see what was the matter, and returned, in a few\r\nseconds, saying that Selina had seen some one in the garden, and neither\r\nshe nor mamma would be satisfied without examination\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98though, of course,\r\nI know what it must be,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, as he drew on his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bill, are you coming?\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff at the door.  \xe2\x80\x98You needn\xe2\x80\x99t, if you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t like it.  I bet it is your old friend.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m coming!  I\xe2\x80\x99m coming!  I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it is,\xe2\x80\x99 shouted Martyn from behind,\r\nwith the inconsistent addition, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my gun.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Enough to dispose of any amount of robbers or phantoms either,\xe2\x80\x99 observed\r\nGriff as they went forth by the back door, reinforced by Amos Bell with a\r\nlantern in one hand and a poker in the other.\r\n\r\nMy father was fortunately still asleep, and my mother came down to see\r\nwhether I was frightened.\r\n\r\nShe said she had no patience with Selina, and had left her to Emily and\r\nher maid; but, before many words had been spoken, they all came creeping\r\ndown after her, feeling safety in numbers, or perhaps in her entire\r\nfearlessness.  The report of a gun gave us all a shock, and elicited\r\nanother scream or two.  My mother, hoping that no one was hurt, hastened\r\ninto the hall, but only to meet Griff, hurrying in laughing to reassure\r\nus with the tidings that it was only Martyn, who had shot the old\r\nsun-dial by way of a robber; and he was presently followed by the others,\r\nMartyn rather crestfallen, but arguing with all his might that the\r\nsun-dial was exactly like a man; and my mother hurried every one off\r\nupstairs without further discussion.\r\n\r\nClarence was rather white, and when Martyn demanded, \xe2\x80\x98Do you really think\r\nit was the ghost?  Fancy her selection of the bird!\xe2\x80\x99 he gravely answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Martyn, boy, if it were, it is not a thing to speak of in that tone.\r\nYou had better go to bed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMartyn went off, somewhat awed.  Clarence was cold and shivering, and\r\nstood warming himself.  He was going to wind up his watch, but his hand\r\nshook, and I did it for him, noting the hour\xe2\x80\x94twenty minutes past one.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Selina, on going upstairs, recollected that she had left\r\nher purse in Griff\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room before going to dress, and had gone in\r\nquest of it.  She heard strange shouts and screams outside, and, going to\r\none of the old windows, where the shutters were less unmanageable than\r\nelsewhere, she beheld a woman rushing towards the house pursued by at\r\nleast a couple of men.  Filled with terror she had called out, and nearly\r\nfainted in Griff\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It agrees with all we have heard before,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98the very day\r\nand hour!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As Martyn said, the person is strange.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Villagers, less concerned, have seen the like,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98and, indeed,\r\nall unconsciously poor Selina has cut away the hope of redress,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsighed.  \xe2\x80\x98Poor, restless spirit! would that I could do anything for her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let me ask, do you ever see her now?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98N-no, I suppose not; but whenever I am anxious or worried, the trouble\r\ntakes her form in my dreams.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLady Peacock had soon extracted the ghost story from her husband, and,\r\nthough she professed to be above the vulgar folly of belief in it, her\r\nnerves were so upset, she said, that nothing would have induced her to\r\nsleep another night in the house.  The rational theory on this occasion\r\nwas that one of the maids must have stolen out to join in the Christmas\r\nentertainment at the Winslow Arms, and been pursued home by some tipsy\r\nrevellers; but this explanation was not productive of goodwill between\r\nthe mother and daughter-in-law, since mamma had from the first so\r\nentirely suspected Selina\xe2\x80\x99s smart nurse as actually to have gone straight\r\nto the nursery on the plea of seeing whether the baby had been\r\nfrightened.  The woman was found asleep\xe2\x80\x94apparently so\xe2\x80\x94said my mother, but\r\nall her clothes were in an untidy heap on the floor, which to my mother\r\nwas proof conclusive that she had slipped into the house in the\r\nconfusion, and settled herself there.  Had not my mother with her own\r\neyes watched from the window her flirtations with the gardener, and was\r\nmore evidence requisite to convict her?  Mamma entertained the hope that\r\nher proposal would be adopted of herself taking charge of her grandson,\r\nand fattening his poor little cheeks on our cows\xe2\x80\x99 milk, while the rest of\r\nthe party continued their round of visits.\r\n\r\nLady Peacock, however, treated it as a personal imputation that _her_\r\nnurse should be accused instead of any servant of Mrs. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s own,\r\nthough, as Griff observed, not only character, but years and features\r\nmight alike acquit them of any such doings; but even he could not laugh\r\nlong, for it was no small vexation to him that such offence should have\r\narisen between his mother and wife.  Of course there was no open\r\nquarrel\xe2\x80\x94my mother had far too much dignity to allow it to come to\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94but each said in private bitter things of the other, and my lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmanner of declining to leave her baby at Chantry House was almost\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nPoor Griffith, who had been growing more like himself every day, tried in\r\nvain to smooth matters, and would have been very glad to leave his child\r\nto my mother\xe2\x80\x99s management, though, of course, he acquitted the nurse of\r\nthe midnight adventure.  He privately owned to us that he had no opinion\r\nof the woman, but he defended her to my mother, in whose eyes this was\r\ntantamount to accusing her own respectable maids, since it was incredible\r\nthat any rational person could accept the phantom theory.\r\n\r\nGladly would he have been on better terms, for he had had to confess that\r\nhis wife\xe2\x80\x99s fortune had turned out to be much less than common report had\r\nstated, or than her style of living justified, and that his marriage had\r\ninvolved him in a sea of difficulties, so that he had to beg for a larger\r\nallowance, and for assistance in paying off debts.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of the London house and of some of the chief expenses were\r\nmade conditions of such favours, and Griffith had assented gratefully\r\nwhen alone with his father; but after an interview with his wife,\r\ndemonstrations were made that it was highly economical to have a house in\r\ntown, and horses, carriages, and servants and that any change would be\r\nhighly derogatory to the heir of Earlscombe and the sacred wishes of the\r\nlate Sir Henry Peacock.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was impressed on us that we were mere homely, countrified\r\nbeings, who could not presume to dictate to her ladyship, but who had ill\r\nrequited her condescension in deigning to beam upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nSLACK WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98O dinna look, ye prideful queen, on a\xe2\x80\x99 aneath your ken,\r\n    For he wha seems the farthest _but_ aft wins the farthest _ben_,\r\n    And whiles the doubie of the schule tak\xe2\x80\x99s lead of a\xe2\x80\x99 the rest:\r\n    The birdie sure to sing is the gorbal of the nest.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98The cauld, grey, misty morn aft brings a sunny summer day;\r\n    The tree wha\xe2\x80\x99s buds are latest is longest to decay;\r\n    The heart sair tried wi\xe2\x80\x99 sorrow still endures the sternest test:\r\n    The birdie sure to sing is the gorbal of the nest.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98The wee wee stern that glints in heaven may be a lowin\xe2\x80\x99 sun,\r\n    Though like a speck of light it seem amid the welkin dun;\r\n    The humblest sodger on the field may win a warrior\xe2\x80\x99s crest:\r\n    The birdie sure to sing is the gorbal of the nest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                       _Scotch Newspaper_.\r\n\r\nTHE wickedness of the nurse was confirmed in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s eyes when the\r\ndoom on the first-born of the Winslows was fulfilled, and the poor little\r\nbaby, Clarence, succumbed to a cold on the chest caught while his nurse\r\nwas gossiping with a guardsman.\r\n\r\nHe was buried in London.  \xe2\x80\x98It was better for Selina to get those things\r\nover as quickly as possible,\xe2\x80\x99 said Griff; but Clarence saw that he\r\nsuffered much more than his wife would let him show to her.  \xe2\x80\x98It is so\r\nbad for him to dwell on it,\xe2\x80\x99 she said.  \xe2\x80\x98You see.  I never let myself\r\ngive way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she was soon going out, nearly as usual, till their one other infant\r\ncame to open its eyes only for a few hours on this troublesome world, and\r\nowe its baptism to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s exertions.  My mother, who was in London\r\njust after, attending on the good old Admiral\xe2\x80\x99s last illness, was greatly\r\ngrieved and disgusted with all she heard and saw of the young pair, and\r\nthat was not much.  She felt their disregard of her uncle as heartless,\r\nor rather as insulting, on Selina\xe2\x80\x99s part, and weak on Griff\xe2\x80\x99s; and on all\r\nsides she heard of their reckless extravagance, which made her forebode\r\nthe worst.\r\n\r\nAll these disappointments much diminished my father\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure and\r\ninterest in his inheritance.  He had little heart to build and improve,\r\nwhen his eldest son\xe2\x80\x99s wife made no secret of her hatred to the place, or\r\nto begin undertakings only to be neglected by those who came after; and\r\nthus several favourite schemes were dropped, or prevented by Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napplications for advances.\r\n\r\nAt last there was a crisis.  At the end of the second season after their\r\nvisit to us, Clarence sent a hasty note, begging my father to join him in\r\naverting an execution in Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s house.  I cannot record the\r\nparticulars, for just at that time I had a long low fever, and did not\r\ntouch my diary for many weeks; nor indeed did I know much about the\r\ncircumstances, since my good nurses withheld as much as possible, and\r\nwould not let me talk about what they believed to make me worse.  Nor can\r\nI find any letters about it.  I believe they were all made away with long\r\nago, and thus I only know that my father hurried up to town, remained for\r\na fortnight, and came back looking ten years older.  The house in London\r\nhad been given up, and he had offered a vacant one of our own, near home,\r\nto Griff to retrench in, but Selina would not hear of it, insisting on\r\ngoing abroad.\r\n\r\nThis was a great grief to him and to us all.  There was only one side of\r\nour lives that was not saddened.  Our old incumbent had died about six\r\nmonths after the Fordyces had gone, and Mr. Henderson had gladly accepted\r\nthe living where the parsonage had been built.  The lady to whom he had\r\nbeen so long engaged was a great acquisition.  Her home had been at\r\nOxford; and she was as thoroughly imbued with the spirit that there\r\nprevailed as was the Hillside curate.  She talked to us of Littlemore,\r\nand of the sermons there and at St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, and Emily and I shared to the\r\nfull her hero-worship.  It was the nearest compensation my sister had had\r\nfor the loss of Ellen, with this difference, that Mrs. Henderson was\r\nolder, had read more, and had conversed thoughtfully with some of the\r\nleading spirits in religious thought, so that she opened a new world to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nPeople would hardly believe in our eagerness and enthusiasm over the\r\nrevelations of church doctrine; how we debated, consulted our books, and\r\ncorresponded with Clarence over what now seems so trite; how we viewed\r\nthe _British Critic_ and _Tracts for the Times_ as our oracles, and\r\nworried the poor Wattlesea bookseller to get them for us at the first\r\npossible moment.\r\n\r\nChurch restoration was setting in.  Henderson had always objected to\r\nchristening from a slop-basin on the altar, and had routed out a\r\ndilapidated font; and now one, which was termed by the country paper\r\nchaste and elegant, was by united efforts, in which Clarence had the\r\nlion\xe2\x80\x99s share, presented in time for the christening of the first child at\r\nthe Parsonage.  It is that which was sent off to the Mission Chapel as a\r\nblot on the rest of Earlscombe Church.  Yet what an achievement it was\r\ndeemed at the time!\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of most of our doings at that era.  We effected them\r\ngradually, and have ever since been undoing them, as our architectural\r\nand ecclesiastical perceptions have advanced.  I wonder how the next\r\ngeneration will deal with our alabaster reredos and our stained windows,\r\nwith which we are all as well pleased as we were fifty years ago with the\r\nplain red cross with a target-like arrangement above and below it in the\r\neast window, or as poor Margaret may have been with her livery\r\naltar-cloth.  Indeed, it seems to me that we got more delight out of our\r\nvery imperfect work, designed by ourselves and sent to Clarence to be\r\nexecuted by men in back streets in London, costing an immensity of\r\ntrouble, than can be had now by simply choosing out of a book of figures\r\nof cut and dried articles.\r\n\r\nWhat an enthusiastic description Clarence sent of the illuminated\r\ncommandments in the new Church of St. Katharine in the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park!\r\nHow Emily and I gloated over the imitation of them when we replaced the\r\nhideous old tables, and how exquisite we thought the initial I, which\r\nirreverent youngsters have likened, with some justice, to an enormous\r\noverfed caterpillar, enwreathed with red and green cabbage leaves!\r\n\r\nMy mother was startled at these innovations; but my father, who had kept\r\nabreast with the thought of the day, owned to the doctrines as chiming in\r\nwith his unbroken belief, and transferred to the improvements in the\r\nchurch the interest which he had lost in the estate.  The farmers had\r\ngiven up their distrust of him, and accepted him loyally as friend and\r\nlandlord, submitting to the reseating of the church, and only growling\r\nmoderately at decorations that cost them nothing.  Daily service began as\r\nsoon as Henderson was his own master, and was better attended than it is\r\nnow; for the old people to whom it was a novelty took up the habit more\r\nfreely than their successors, to whom the bell has been familiar through\r\ntheir days of toil.  We were too far off to be constant attendants; but\r\nevensong made an object for our airings, and my father\xe2\x80\x99s head, now quite\r\nwhite, was often seen there.  He felt it a great relief amid the cares of\r\nhis later years.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was with a view to him that Mr. Castleford arranged that\r\nClarence should become manager for the firm at Bristol, with a good\r\nsalary.  The Robsons would not take a fresh lodger\xe2\x80\x94they were getting too\r\nold for fresh beginnings; but they kept their rooms ready for him,\r\nwhenever he had to be in town, and Gooch found him a trustworthy widow as\r\nhousekeeper.  He took a little cottage at Clifton, availing himself of\r\nthe coach to spend his Sundays with us; and it was an acknowledged joy to\r\nevery one that I should drive to meet him every Saturday afternoon at the\r\nCarpenter\xe2\x80\x99s Arms, and bring him home to be my father\xe2\x80\x99s aid in all his\r\nbusiness, and a most valuable help in Sunday parish work, in which he had\r\nan amount of experience which astonished us.\r\n\r\nWhat would have become of the singing without him?  The first hint\r\nagainst the remarkable anthems had long ago alienated our tuneful choir\r\nplaced on high, and they had deserted _en masse_.  Then Emily and the\r\nschoolmistress had toiled at the school children, whose thin little pipes\r\nand provincialisms were a painful infliction, till Mrs. Henderson, backed\r\nby Clarence, worked up a few promising men\xe2\x80\x99s voices to support them.  We\r\nthought everything but the New and Old Versions smacked of dissent,\r\nexcept the hymns at the end of the Prayer-book, though we did not go as\r\nfar as Chapman, who told Emily he understood as how all the tunes was\r\ntried over in Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Commons afore they were sent out, and it was not\r\n\xe2\x80\x98liable\xe2\x80\x99 to change them.  One of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s amusements in his lonely life\r\nhad been the acquisition of a knowledge of music, and he had a really\r\ngood voice; while his adherence to our choir encouraged other young men\r\nof the farmer and artisan class to join us.  Choir, however, did not mean\r\nsurplices and cassocks, but a collection of our best voices, male and\r\nfemale, in the gallery.\r\n\r\nMartyn began to be a great help when at home, never having wavered in his\r\npurpose of becoming a clergyman.  On going to Oxford, he became imbued\r\nwith the influences that made Alma Mater the focus of the religious life\r\nand progress of that generation which is now the elder one.  There might\r\nin some be unreality, in others extravagance, in others mere imitation;\r\nbut there was a truly great work on the minds of the young men of that\r\nera\xe2\x80\x94a work which has stood the test of time, made saints and martyrs, and\r\nsown the seed whereof we have witnessed a goodly growth, in spite of\r\ncruel shocks and disappointments, fightings within and fears without,\r\nslanders and follies to provoke them, such as we can now afford to laugh\r\nover.  With Martyn, rubrical or extra-rubrical observances were the\r\noutlet of the exuberance of youth, as chivalry and romance had been to\r\nus; and on Frank Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s visits, it was delightful to find that he too\r\nwas in the full swing of these ideas and habits, partly from his own\r\nconvictions, partly from his parish needs, and partly carried along by\r\ncurates fresh from Oxford.\r\n\r\nIn the first of his summer vacations Martyn joined a reading party, with\r\na tutor of the same calibre, and assured them that if they took up their\r\nquarters in a farmhouse not many miles by the map from Beachharbour, they\r\nwould have access to unlimited services, with the extraordinary luxury of\r\na surpliced choir, and intercourse with congenial spirits, which to him\r\nmeant the Fordyces.\r\n\r\nOn arriving, however, the bay proved to be so rocky and dangerous that\r\nthere was no boating across it, as he had confidently expected.  The farm\r\ndepended on a market town in the opposite direction, and though the\r\nlights of Beachharbour could be seen at night, there was no way thither\r\nexcept by a six-miles walk along a cliff path, with a considerable d\xc3\xa9tour\r\nin order to reach a bridge and cross the rapid river which was an element\r\nof danger in the bay, on the north side of the promontory which sheltered\r\nthe harbour to the south.\r\n\r\nSo when Martyn started as pioneer on the morning before the others\r\narrived, he descended into Beachharbour later than he intended, but still\r\nhe was in time to meet Anne Fordyce, a tall, bright-faced girl of\r\nfourteen, taking her after-lessons turn on the parade with a governess,\r\nwho looked amazed as the two met, holding out both hands to one another,\r\nwith eager joy and welcome.\r\n\r\nIt was not the same when Anne flew into the Vicarage with the rapturous\r\nannouncement, \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s Martyn!\xe2\x80\x99  The vicar was gone to a clerical meeting,\r\nand Mrs. Fordyce said nothing about staying to see him.  The luncheon was\r\na necessity, but with quiet courtesy Martyn was made to understand that\r\nhe was regarded as practically out of reach, and \xe2\x80\x98Oh, mamma, he could\r\ncome and sleep,\xe2\x80\x99 was nipped in the utterance by \xe2\x80\x98Martyn is busy with his\r\nstudies; we must not disturb him.\xe2\x80\x99  This was a sufficient intimation that\r\nMrs. Fordyce did not intend to have the pupils dropping in on her\r\ncontinually, and making her house their resort; and while Martyn was\r\ndigesting the rebuff, the governess carried Anne off to prepare for a\r\nmusic lesson, and her mother gave no encouragement to lingering or\r\nrepeating the visit.\r\n\r\nStill Martyn, on his way homewards, based many hopes on the return of Mr.\r\nFordyce; but all that ensued was, three weeks later, a note regretting\r\nthe not having been able to call, and inviting the whole party to a great\r\nschool-feast on the anniversary of the dedication of the first of the\r\nnumerous new churches of Beachharbour.  There was no want of cordiality\r\non that occasion, but time was lacking for anything beyond greetings and\r\nfleeting exchanges of words.  Parson Frank tried to talk to Martyn,\r\nbemoaned the not seeing more of him, declared his intentions of coming to\r\nthe farm, began an invitation, but was called off a hundred ways; and\r\nAnne was rushing about with all the children of the place, gentle and\r\nsimple, on her hands.  Whenever Martyn tried to help her, he was called\r\noff some other way, and engaged at last in the hopeless task of teaching\r\ncricket where these fisher boys had never heard of it.\r\n\r\nThat was all he saw of our old friends, and he was much hurt by such\r\ningratitude.  So were we all, and though we soon acquitted the head of\r\nthe family of more than the forgetfulness of over occupation, the\r\nsoreness at his wife\xe2\x80\x99s coldness was not so soon passed over.  Yet from\r\nher own point of view, poor woman, she might be excused for a panic lest\r\nher second daughter might go the way of the first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nOUTWARD BOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98As slow our ship her foamy track\r\n       Against the wind was cleaving,\r\n    Her trembling pennant still looked back\r\n       To the dear isle \xe2\x80\x99twas leaving.\r\n    So loath we part from all we love,\r\n       From all the links that bind us,\r\n    So turn our hearts as on we rove\r\n       To those we\xe2\x80\x99ve left behind us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                 T. MOORE.\r\n\r\nTHE first time I saw Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s _m\xc3\xa9nage_ was in that same summer of poor\r\nMartyn\xe2\x80\x99s repulse.  My father had come in for a small property in his\r\noriginal county of Shropshire, and this led to his setting forth with my\r\nmother to make necessary arrangements, and then to pay visits to old\r\nfriends; leaving Emily and me to be guests to our brother at Clifton.\r\n\r\nWe told them it was their harvest honeymoon, and it was funny to see how\r\nthey enjoyed the scheme when they had once made up their minds to it, and\r\nour share in the project was equally new and charming, for Emily and I,\r\nthough both some way on in our twenties, were still in many respects home\r\nchildren, nor had I ever been out on a visit on my own account.  The\r\nyellow chariot began by conveying Emily and me to our destination.\r\n\r\nClifton has grown considerably since those days, and terraces have\r\nswallowed up the site of what the post-office knew as Prospect Cottage,\r\nbut we were apt to term the doll\xe2\x80\x99s house, for, as Emily said, our visit\r\nthere had something the same effect as a picnic or tea drinking at little\r\nAnne\xe2\x80\x99s famous baby house.  In like manner, it was tiny, square, with one\r\nsash-window on each side of the door, but it was nearly covered with\r\ncreepers, odds and ends which Clarence brought from home, and induced to\r\nflourish and take root better than their parent stocks.  In his nursery\r\ndays his precision had given him the name of \xe2\x80\x98the old bachelor,\xe2\x80\x99 and he\r\nhad all a sailor\xe2\x80\x99s tidiness.  Even his black cat and brown spaniel each\r\nhad its peculiar basket and mat, and had been taught never to transgress\r\ntheir bounds or interfere with one another; and the effect of his\r\nparlour, embellished as it was in our honour, was delightful.  The\r\noutlook was across the beautiful ravine, into the wooded slopes on the\r\nfurther side, and, on the other side, down the widening cleft to that\r\ngiddy marvel, the suspension bridge, with vessels passing under it, and\r\nthe expanse beyond.\r\n\r\nMost entirely we enjoyed ourselves, making merry over Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhousekeeping, employing ourselves after our wonted semi-student,\r\nsemi-artist fashion in the morning; and, when our host came home from\r\nbusiness, starting on country expeditions, taking a carriage whenever the\r\ndistance exceeded Emily\xe2\x80\x99s powers of walking beside my chair; sketching,\r\nbotanising, or investigating church architecture, our newest hobby.  I\r\nsketched, and the other two rambled about, measuring and filling up\r\narch\xc3\xa6ological papers, with details of orientation, style, and all the\r\nrest, deploring barbarisms and dilapidations, making curious and\r\ndelightful discoveries, pitying those who thought the Dun Cow\xe2\x80\x99s rib and\r\nChatterton\xe2\x80\x99s loft the most interesting features of St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Redcliff,\r\nand above all rubbing brasses with heel ball, and hanging up their grim\r\neffigies wherever there was a vacant space on the walls of our doll\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nAnd though we grumbled when Clarence was detained at the office later\r\nthan we expected, this was qualified by pride at feeling his importance\r\nthere as a man in authority.  It was, however, with much dismay and some\r\ninhospitality that we learnt that a young man belonging to the office\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nfact, Mr. Frith\xe2\x80\x99s great-nephew\xe2\x80\x94was coming to sail for Canton in one of\r\nthe vessels belonging to the firm, and would have to be \xe2\x80\x98looked after.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe could not be asked to sleep at Prospect Cottage, for Emily had the\r\nonly spare bedchamber, and Clarence had squeezed himself into a queer\r\nlittle dressing closet to give me his room; but the housekeeper (a\r\ntreasure found by Gooch) secured an apartment in the next house, and we\r\nwere to act hosts, much against our will.  Clarence had barely seen the\r\nyouth, who had been employed in the office at Liverpool, living with his\r\nmother, who was in ill-health and had died in the last spring.  The only\r\ntime of seeing him, he had seemed to be a very shy raw lad; but, \xe2\x80\x98poor\r\nfellow, we can make the best of him,\xe2\x80\x99 was the sentiment; \xe2\x80\x98it is only for\r\none night.\xe2\x80\x99  However, we were dismayed when, as Emily was in the crisis\r\nof washing-in a sky, it was announced that a gentleman was asking for Mr.\r\nWinslow.  Churlishness bade us despatch him to the office, but humanity\r\nprevailed to invite him previously to share our luncheon.  Yet we doubted\r\nwhether it had not been a cruel mercy when he entered, evidently\r\nunprepared to stumble on a young lady and a deformed man, and stammering\r\npiteously as he hoped there was no mistake\xe2\x80\x94Mr. Winslow\xe2\x80\x94Prospect, etc.\r\n\r\nEmily explained, frustrating his desire to flee at once to the office,\r\nand pointing out his lodging, close at hand, whence he was invited to\r\nreturn in a few minutes to the meal.\r\n\r\nWe had time for some amiable exclamations, \xe2\x80\x98The oaf!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98What a bore!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He has spoilt my sky!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98I shan\xe2\x80\x99t finish this to-day!\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98Shall we order\r\na carriage and take him to the office; we can\xe2\x80\x99t have him on our hands all\r\nthe afternoon?\xe2\x80\x99  \xe2\x80\x98And we might get the new number of _Nicholas\r\nNickleby_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nN.B.\xe2\x80\x94Perhaps it was _Oliver Twist_ or _The Old Curiosity Shop_\xe2\x80\x94I am not\r\ncertain which was the current excitement just then; but I am quite sure\r\nit was Mrs. Nickleby who first disclosed to us that our guest had a\r\nsplendid pair of dark eyes.  Hitherto he had kept them averted in the\r\nstudious manner I have often noticed in persons who did not wish to\r\nexcite suspicion of staring at my peculiarities; but that lady\xe2\x80\x99s feelings\r\nwhen her neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s legs came down her chimney were too much for his\r\nself-consciousness, and he gave a glance that disclosed dark liquid\r\ndepths, sparkling with mirth.  He was one number in advance of us, and\r\ncould enlighten us on the next stage in the coming story; and this went\r\nfar to reconcile us to the invasion, and to restore him to the proper use\r\nof his legs and arms\xe2\x80\x94and very shapely limbs they were, for he was a slim,\r\nwell-made fellow, with a dark gipsy complexion, and intelligent, honest\r\nface, altogether better than we expected.\r\n\r\nYet we could have groaned when in the evening, Clarence brought him back\r\nwith tidings that something had gone wrong with the ship.  If I tried to\r\nexplain, I might be twitted with,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98The bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut of course Clarence knew all about it, and he thought it unlikely that\r\nthe vessel would be in sailing condition for a week at soonest.  Great\r\nwas our dismay!  Getting through one evening by the help of walking and\r\nthen singing was one thing, having the heart of our visit consumed by an\r\ninterloper was another; though Clarence undertook to take him to the\r\noffice and find some occupation for him that might keep him out of our\r\nway.  But it was Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s leisure hours that we begrudged; though truly\r\nno one could be meeker than this unlucky Lawrence Frith, nor more\r\nconscious of being an insufferable burthen.  I even detected a tear in\r\nhis eye when Clarence and Emily were singing \xe2\x80\x98Sweet Home.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do you know,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, on the second evening, when his guest had\r\ngone to dress for dinner, \xe2\x80\x98I am very sorry for that poor lad.  It is only\r\nsix weeks since he lost his mother, and he has not a soul to care for\r\nhim, either here or where he is going.  I had fancied the family were\r\nunder a cloud, but I find it was only that old Frith quarrelled with the\r\nfather for taking Holy Orders instead of going into our house.  Probably\r\nthere was some imprudence; for the poor man died a curate and left no\r\nprovision for his family.  The only help the old man would give was to\r\ntake the boy into the office at Liverpool, stopping his education just as\r\nhe was old enough to care about it.  There were a delicate mother and two\r\nsisters then, but they are all gone now; scarlet fever carried off the\r\ndaughters, and Mrs. Frith never was well again.  He seems to have spent\r\nhis time in waiting on her when off duty, and to have made no friends\r\nexcept one or two contemporaries of hers; and his only belongings are old\r\nFrith and Mrs. Stevens, who are packing him off to Canton without caring\r\na rap what becomes of him.  I know what Mrs. Stevens is at; she comes up\r\nto town much oftener now, and has got her husband\xe2\x80\x99s nephew into the\r\noffice, and is trying to get everything for him; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason\r\nshe wants to keep up the old feud, and send this poor Lawrence off to the\r\nends of the earth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can\xe2\x80\x99t you do anything for him?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Emily.  \xe2\x80\x98I thought Mr. Frith did\r\nattend to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence laughed.  \xe2\x80\x98I know that Mrs. Stevens hates me like poison; but\r\nthat is the only reason I have for supposing I might have any influence.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And can\xe2\x80\x99t you speak to Mr. Castleford?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Set him to interfere about old Frith\xe2\x80\x99s relations!  He would know better!\r\nBesides, the fellow is too old to get into any other line\xe2\x80\x94four-and-twenty\r\nhe says, though he does not look it; and he is as innocent as a baby,\r\nindifferent just now to what becomes of him, or whither he goes; it is\r\nall the same to him, he says; there is no one to care for him anywhere,\r\nand I think he is best pleased to go where it is all new.  And there, you\r\nsee, the poor lad will be left to drift to destruction\xe2\x80\x94mother\xe2\x80\x99s darling\r\nthat he has been\xe2\x80\x94just for want of some human being to care about him, and\r\nhinder his getting heartless and reckless!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s voice trembled, and Emily had tears in her eyes as she asked\r\nif absolutely nothing could be done for him.  Clarence meant to write to\r\nMr. Castleford, who would no doubt beg the chaplain at the station to\r\nshow the young man some kindness; also, perhaps, to the resident partner,\r\nwhom Clarence had looked at once over his desk, but in his rawest and\r\nmost depressed days.  The only clerk out there, whom he knew, would, he\r\nthought, be no element of safety, and would not like the youth the better\r\neither for bringing his recommendation or bearing old Frith\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nWe were considerably softened towards our guest, though the next time\r\nEmily came on him he was standing in the hall, transfixed in\r\ncontemplation of her greatest achievement in brass-rubbing, a severe and\r\nsable knight with the most curly of nostrils, the stiffest and\r\nstraightest of mouths, hair straight on his brows, pointed toes joined\r\ntogether below, and fingers touching over his breast.  There he hung in\r\ntriumph just within the front door, fluttering and swaying a little on\r\nhis pins whenever a draught came in; and there stood Lawrence Frith,\r\nfreshly aware of him, and unable to repress the exclamation, \xe2\x80\x98I say!\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t he a guy?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir Guy de Warrenne,\xe2\x80\x99 began Emily composedly; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you see his coat of\r\narms? \xe2\x80\x9cchequy argent and azure.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Does your brother keep him there to scare away the tramps?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEmily\xe2\x80\x99s countenance was a study.\r\n\r\nThe subject of brasses was unfolded to Lawrence Frith, and before the end\r\nof the week he had spent an entire day on his hands and knees, scrubbing\r\naway with the waxy black compound at a figure in the Cathedral\xe2\x80\x94the\r\noffice-work, as we declared, which Clarence gave him to do.  In fact he\r\nbecame so thoroughly infected that it was a pity that he was going where\r\nthere would be no exercise in ecclesiology\xe2\x80\x94rather the reverse.\r\nEmbarrassment on his side, and hostility on ours, may be said to have\r\nvanished under the influence of Sir Guy de Warrenne\xe2\x80\x99s austere\r\ncountenance.  The youth seemed to regard \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99 in the light of a\r\nfather, and to accept us as kindly beings.  He ceased to contort his\r\nlimbs in our awful presence, looked at me like as an ordinary person, and\r\neven ventured on giving me an arm.  He listened with unfeigned pleasure\r\nto our music, perilled his neck on St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s rocks in search of\r\nplants, and by and by took to hanging back with Emily, while Clarence\r\nwalked on with me, to talk to her out of his full heart about his mother\r\nand sisters.\r\n\r\nThree weeks elapsed before the _Hoang-ho_ was ready to sail, and by that\r\ntime Lawrence knew that there were some who would rejoice in his success,\r\nor grieve if things went ill with him.  Clarence and I had promised him\r\nlong home letters, and impressed on him that we should welcome his\r\nintelligence of himself.  For verily he had made his way into our hearts,\r\nas a thoroughly good-hearted, affectionate being, yearning for something\r\nto cling to; intelligent and refined, though his recent cultivation had\r\nbeen restricted, soundly principled, and trained in religious feelings\r\nand habits, but so utterly inexperienced that there was no guessing how\r\nit might be with him when cast adrift, with no object save his own\r\nmaintenance, and no one to take an interest in him.\r\n\r\nClarence talked to him paternally, and took him to second-hand shops to\r\nprovide a cheap library of substantial reading, engaging to cater for him\r\nfor the future, not omitting Dickens; and Emily worked at providing him\r\nwith the small conveniences and comforts for the voyage that called for a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.  He was so grateful that it was like fitting out a dear\r\nfriend or younger brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I wonder,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, as he walked by my chair on one of the last\r\ndays, \xe2\x80\x98whether it was altogether wise to have this young Frith here so\r\nmuch, though it could hardly have been helped.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which I rejoined that it could hardly have displeased the uncle, and\r\nthat if it did, the youth\xe2\x80\x99s welfare was worth annoying him for.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I meant something nearer home,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, and proceeded to ask if I\r\ndid not think Lawrence Frith a good deal smitten with Emily.\r\n\r\nTo me it seemed an idea not worth consideration.  Any youth, especially\r\none who had lived so secluded a life, would naturally be taken by the\r\nfirst pleasing young woman who came in his way, and took a kindly\r\ninterest in him; but I did not think Emily very susceptible, being\r\nentirely wrapped up in home and parish matters; and I reminded Clarence\r\nthat she had not been loverless.  She had rejected the Curate of\r\nHillside; and we all saw, though she did not, that only her evident\r\nindifference kept Sir George Eastwood\xe2\x80\x99s second son from making further\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nClarence was not convinced.  He said he had never seen our sister look at\r\neither of these as she did when Lawrence came into the room; and there\r\nwas no denying that there was a soft and embellishing light on her whole\r\ncountenance, and a fresh sweetness in her voice.  But then he seemed such\r\na boy as to make the notion ridiculous; and yet, on reckoning, it proved\r\nthat their years were equal.  All that could be hoped was that the\r\nsentiment, if it existed, would not discover itself before they parted,\r\nso as to open their eyes to the dreariness of the prospect, and cause our\r\nmother to think we had betrayed our trust in the care of our sister.  As\r\nwe could do nothing, we were not sorry that this was the last day.\r\nClarence was to go on board with Frith, see him out of the river, and\r\ncome back with the pilot; and we all drove down to the wharf together;\r\nnobody saying much by the way, except the few jerky remarks we brothers\r\nfelt bound to originate and reply to.\r\n\r\nEmily sat very still, her head bent under her shading bonnet\xe2\x80\x94I think she\r\nwas trying to keep back tears for the solitary exile; and Lawrence,\r\nopposite, was unable to help watching her with wistful eyes, which would\r\nhave revealed all, if we had not guessed it already.  It might be\r\npresumptuous, but it made us very sorry for him.\r\n\r\nWhen the moment of parting came, there was a wringing of hands, and,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you, thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 in a low, broken, heartfelt voice, and to Emily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have made life a new thing to me.  I shall never forget,\xe2\x80\x99 and the\r\nshowing of a tiny book in his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nWhen the two had disappeared, Emily, no longer restraining her tears,\r\ntold me that she had exchanged Prayer-books with him, and they were to\r\nread the Psalms at the same time every day.  \xe2\x80\x98I thought it might be a\r\nhelp to him,\xe2\x80\x99 she said simply.\r\n\r\nNor was there any consciousness in her talk as she related to me what he\r\nhad told her about his mother and sisters, and his dreary sense of\r\npiteous loneliness, till we had adopted him as a brother\xe2\x80\x94in which\r\ncapacity I trusted that she viewed him.\r\n\r\nHowever, Clarence had been the recipient of all the poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s fervent\r\nfeelings for Miss Winslow, how she had been a new revelation to his\r\ndesolate spirit, and was to be the guiding star of his life, etc., etc.,\r\nall from the bottom of his heart, though he durst not dream of requital,\r\nand was to live, not on hope, but on memory of the angelic kindness of\r\nthese three weeks.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to be touched, though we strove to be worldly wise\r\nold bachelors, and assured one another that the best and most probable\r\nthing that could happen to Lawrence Frith would be to have his dream\r\nblown away by the Atlantic breezes, and be left open to the charms of\r\nsome Chinese merchant\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nTOO LATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Thus Esau-like, our Father\xe2\x80\x99s blessing miss,\r\n    Then wash with fruitless tears our faded crown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                    KEBLE.\r\n\r\nAFTER such a rebuff as Martyn had experienced at Beachharbour, he no\r\nlonger haunted its neighbourhood, but devoted the long vacation of the\r\nensuing year to a walking tour in Germany, with one or two congenial\r\nspirits, who shared his delight in scenery, pictures, and architecture.\r\n\r\nBy and by he wrote to Clarence from Baden Baden\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whom do you think I should find here but Griffith and his bird?  I first\r\nspotted the old fellow smoking under a tree in the Grand Platz, but he\r\nlooked so seedy and altered altogether that I was not sure enough of him\r\nto speak, especially as he showed no signs of knowing me.  (He says it\r\nwas my whiskers that stumped him.)  I made inquiries and found that they\r\nfigured as \xe2\x80\x9cSir Peacock and lady,\xe2\x80\x9d but they were entered all right in the\r\nbook.  He is taking the \xe2\x80\x9cK\xc3\xbcr\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looks as if he wanted it\xe2\x80\x94and she is\r\ntaking _rouge et noir_.  I saw her at the salon, with her neck grown as\r\nlong as her namesake\xe2\x80\x99s, but not as pretty, claws to match, thin and\r\npainted, as if the ruling passion was consuming her.  Poor old Griff! he\r\nwas glad enough to see me, but he is wofully shaky, and nearly came to\r\ntears when he asked after Ted and all at home.  They had an upset of\r\ntheir carriage in Vienna last winter, and he got some twist, or other\r\ndamage, which he thought nothing of, but it has never righted itself; I\r\nam sure he is very ill, and ought to be looked after.  He has had only\r\nforeign doctoring, and you know he never was strong in languages.  I\r\nheard of the medico here inquiring what precise symptom _der Englander_\r\nmeant by being \xe2\x80\x9cdown in zie mout!\xe2\x80\x9d  Poor Griff is that, whatever else he\r\nis, and Selina does not see it, nor anything else but her _rouge et noir_\r\ntable.  I am afraid he plays too, when he is up to it, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t stand\r\nmuch of the stuffiness of the place, and he respects my innocence, poor\r\nold beggar; so he has kept out of it, since we have been here.  He seems\r\nglad to have me to look after him, but afraid to let me stay, for fear of\r\nmy falling a victim to the place.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t well tell him that there is a\r\nperpetual warning to youth in the persons of himself and his Peacock.\r\nHis mind might be vastly relieved if I were out of it, but scarcely his\r\nbody; and I shall not leave him till I hear from home.  Thomson says I am\r\nright.  I should like to bring the poor old man home for advice,\r\nespecially if my lady could be left behind, and by all appearances she\r\nwould not object.  Could not you come, or mamma?  Speak to papa about it.\r\nIt is all so disgusting that I really could not write to him.  It is\r\nenough to break one\xe2\x80\x99s heart to see Griff when he hears about home, and\r\nEdward, and Emily.  I told him how famously you were getting on, and he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been all up, up with him, all down, down with me,\xe2\x80\x9d and then\r\nhe wanted me to fix my day for leaving Baden, as if it were a sink of\r\ninfection.  I fancy he thinks me a mere infant still, for he won\xe2\x80\x99t heed a\r\nword of advice about taking care of himself and _will_ do the most\r\nfoolish things imaginable for a man in his state, though I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out\r\nwhat is the matter with him.  I tried both French and Latin with his\r\ndoctor, equally in vain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was a great consultation over this letter.  Our parents would fain\r\nhave gone at once to Baden, but my father was far from well; in fact, it\r\nwas the beginning of the break-up of his constitution.  He had been\r\nageing ever since his disappointment in Griffith, and though he had so\r\nenjoyed his jaunt with my mother that he had seemed revived for the time,\r\nhe had been visibly failing ever since the winter, and my mother durst\r\nnot leave him.  Indeed she was only too well aware that her presence was\r\napt to inspire Selina with the spirit of contradiction, and that Clarence\r\nwould have a better chance alone.  He was to go up to London by the mail\r\ntrain, see Mr. Castleford, and cross to Ostend.\r\n\r\nA valise from the lumber-room was wanted, and at bedtime he went in quest\r\nof it.  He came back white and shaken; and I said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have not seen _her_?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I have.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not her time of year.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No; I was not even thinking of her.  There was none of the wailing, but\r\nwhen I looked up from my rummaging, there was her face as if in a window\r\nor mirror on the wall.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t dwell on it\xe2\x80\x99 was all I could entreat, for the apparition at\r\nunusual times had been mentioned as a note of doom, and not only did it\r\nweigh on me, but it might send Clarence off in a desponding mood.\r\nTidings were less rapid when telegraphs were not, and railways\r\nincomplete.  Clarence did not reach Baden till ten days after the\r\ndespatch of Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s letter, and Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s condition had in the meantime\r\nbecome much more serious.  Low fever had set in, and he was confined to\r\nhis dreary lodgings, where Martyn was doing his best for him in an\r\ninexperienced, helpless sort of way, while Lady Peacock was at the\r\n_salle_, persisting in her belief that the ailment was a temporary\r\nmatter.  Martyn afterwards declared that he had never seen anything more\r\ntouching than poor Griff\xe2\x80\x99s look of intense rest and relief at Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nOn the way through London, by the assistance of Mr. Castleford, Clarence\r\nhad ascertained how to procure the best medical advice attainable, and he\r\nwas linguist enough to be an adequate interpreter.  Alas! all that was\r\nachieved was the discovery that between difficulties of language, Griff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown indifference, and his wife\xe2\x80\x99s carelessness, the injury had developed\r\ninto fatal disease.  An operation _might_ yet save him, if he could rally\r\nenough for it, but the fever was rapidly destroying his remaining\r\nstrength.  Selina ascribed it to excitement at meeting Martyn, and indeed\r\nhe had been subject to such attacks every autumn.  Any way, he had no\r\nspirits nor wish for improvement.  If his brothers told him he was\r\nbetter, he smiled and said it was like a condemned criminal trying to\r\nrecover enough for the gallows.  His only desire was to be let alone and\r\nhave Clarence with him.  He had ceased to be uneasy as to Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexposure to temptation, but he said he could hardly bear to watch that\r\nbright, fresh young manhood, and recollect how few years had passed since\r\nhe had been such another, nor did he like to have any nurse save\r\nClarence.  His wife at first acquiesced, holding fast to the theory of\r\nthe periodical autumnal fever, and then that the operation would restore\r\nhim to health; and as her presence fretted him, and he received her small\r\nattentions peevishly, she persisted in her usual habits, and heard with\r\npetulance his brothers\xe2\x80\x99 assurances of his being in a critical condition,\r\ndeclaring that it was always thus with these fevers\xe2\x80\x94he was always cross\r\nand low-spirited, and no one could tell what she had undergone with him.\r\n\r\nThen came days of positive pain, and nights of delirious, dreary\r\nmurmuring about home and all of us, more especially Ellen Fordyce.\r\nClarence had no time for letters, and Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s became a call for mamma,\r\nwith the old childish trust in her healing and comforting powers,\r\ndeclaring that he would meet her at Cologne, and steer her through the\r\ndifficulties of foreign travel.\r\n\r\nHesitation was over now.  My father was most anxious to send her, and she\r\nset forth, secure that she could infuse life, energy, and resolution into\r\nher son, when those two poor boys had failed.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, Martyn who met her, but his friend Thomson, with the\r\ntidings that the suffering had become so severe as to prevent Martyn from\r\nleaving Baden, not only on his brother\xe2\x80\x99s account, but because Lady\r\nPeacock had at last taken alarm, and was so uncontrollable in her\r\ndistress that he was needed to keep her out of the sickroom, where her\r\npresence, poor thing, only did mischief.\r\n\r\nShe evidently had a certain affection for her husband; and it was the\r\nmore piteous that in his present state he only regarded her as the\r\ntempter who had ruined his life\xe2\x80\x94his false Duessa, who had led him away\r\nfrom Una.  On one unhappy evening he had been almost maddened by her\r\ninsisting on arguing with him; he called her a hag, declared she had been\r\nthe death of his children, the death of that dear one\xe2\x80\x94could she not let\r\nhim alone now she had been the death of himself?\r\n\r\nWhen Martyn took her away, she wept bitterly, and told enough to make the\r\nmisery of their life apparent, when the gaiety was over, and regrets and\r\nrecriminations set in.\r\n\r\nHowever, there came a calmer interval, when the suffering passed off, but\r\nin the manner which made the German doctor intimate that hope was over.\r\nWould life last till his mother came?\r\n\r\nHis brothers had striven from the first to awaken thoughts of higher\r\nthings, and turn remorse into repentance; but every attempt resulted in\r\nstrange, sad wanderings about Esau, the birthright, and the blessing.\r\nIndeed, these might not have been entirely wanderings, for once he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is better this way, Bill.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you wish in trying to\r\nbring me round.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t be hard on me.  She drove me to it.  It is all\r\nright now.  The Jews will be disappointed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor even at the crisis in London, he had concealed that he had raised\r\nmoney on _post obits_, so that, had he outlived my father, Chantry House\r\nwould have been lost.  Lady Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s fortune had been undermined when\r\nshe married him; extravagance and gambling had made short work of the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nWhy should I speak of such things here, except to mourn over our\r\nmuch-loved brother, with all his fine qualities and powers wasted and\r\noverthrown?  He clung to Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s affection, and submitted to prayers\r\nand psalms, but without response.  He showed tender recollection of us\r\nall, but scarcely durst think of his father, and hardly appeared to wish\r\nto see his mother.  Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s object soon came to be to obtain\r\nforgiveness for the wife, since bitterness against her seemed the great\r\nobstacle to seeking pardon, peace, or hope; but each attempt only\r\nproduced such bitterness against her, and such regrets and mourning for\r\nEllen, as fearfully shook the failing frame, while he moaned forth\r\ncomplaints of the blandishments and raillery with which his temptress had\r\nbeguiled him.  Clarence tried in vain to turn away this idea, but nothing\r\nhad any effect till he bethought himself of Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s message, that she\r\nknew even this fatal act had been prompted by generosity of spirit.\r\nThere was truth enough in it to touch Griff, but only so far as to cry,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What might I not have been with her?\xe2\x80\x99  Still, there was no real\r\nsoftening till my mother came.  He knew her at once, and all the old\r\nchildish relations were renewed between them.  There was little time left\r\nnow, but he was wholly hers.  Even Clarence was almost set aside, save\r\nwhere strength was needed, and the mother seemed to have equal control of\r\nspirit and body.  It was she, who, scarcely aware of what had gone\r\nbefore, caused him to admit Selina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell her not to talk,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.  \xe2\x80\x98But we have each much to forgive one\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe came in, awed and silent, and he let her kiss him, sit near at hand,\r\nand wait on my mother, whose coming had, as it were, insensibly taken the\r\nbitterness away and made him as a little child in her hands.  He could\r\nfollow prayers in which she led him, as he could not, or did not seem to\r\ndo, with any one else, for he was never conscious of the presence of the\r\nclergyman whom Thomson hunted up and brought, and who prayed aloud with\r\nMartyn while the physical agony claimed both my mother and Clarence.\r\n\r\nOnce Griff looked about him and called out for our father, then\r\nrecollecting, muttered, \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x94the birthright gone\xe2\x80\x94no blessing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt grieved us much, it grieves me now, that this was his last distinct\r\nutterance.  He _looked_ as if the comforting replies and the appeals to\r\nthe Source of all redemption did awaken a response, but he never spoke\r\narticulately again; and only thirty-six hours after my mother\xe2\x80\x99s arrival,\r\nall was over.\r\n\r\nPoor Selina went into passions of hysterics and transports of grief,\r\nneeding all the firmness of so resolute a woman as my mother to deal with\r\nher.  She was wild in self-accusation, and became so ill that the care of\r\nher was a not unwholesome occupation for my mother, who was one of those\r\nwith whom sorrow has little immediate outlet, and is therefore the more\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\nShe would not bring our brother\xe2\x80\x99s coffin home, thinking the agitation\r\nwould be hurtful to my father, and anxious to get back to him as soon as\r\npossible.  So Griff was buried at Baden, and from time to time some of us\r\nhave visited his grave.  Of course she proposed Selina\xe2\x80\x99s return to\r\nChantry House with her; but Mr. Clarkson, the brother, had come out to\r\nthe funeral, and took his sister home with him, certainly much to our\r\nrelief, though all the sad party at Baden had drawn much nearer together\r\nin these latter days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nA PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \xe2\x80\x98It then draws near the season\r\n    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                 _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\nWE had really lost our Griffith long before\xe2\x80\x94our bright, generous,\r\nwarm-hearted, promising Griff, the brilliance of our home; but his actual\r\ndeath made the first breach in a hitherto unbroken family, and was a new\r\nand strange shock.  It made my father absolutely an old man; and it also\r\nchanged Martyn.  His first contact with responsibility, suffering, and\r\ndeath had demolished the light-hearted boyishness which had lasted in the\r\nyoungest of the family through all his high aspirations.  Till his return\r\nto Oxford, his chief solace was in getting some one of us alone, going\r\nthrough all the scenes at Baden, discussing his new impressions of the\r\ntrials and perplexities of life, and seeking out passages in the books\r\nthat were becoming our oracles.  What he had admired externally before,\r\nhe was grasping from within; nor can I describe what the _Lyra\r\nApostolica_, and the two first volumes of _Parochial Sermons preached at\r\nLittlemore_, became to us.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarkson had been rather dry with my brothers at Baden, evidently\r\nconsidering that poor Griffith had been as fatal to his sister as we\r\nthought Selina had been to our brother.  It was hardly just, for there\r\nhad been much more to spoil in him than in her; and though she would\r\nhardly have trod a much higher path, there is no saying what he might\r\nhave been but for her.\r\n\r\nGriffith had said nothing about providing for her, not having forgiven\r\nher till he was past recollecting the need, but her brother had intimated\r\nthat something was due from the family, and Clarence had assented\xe2\x80\x94not,\r\nindeed, as to her deserts, poor woman, but her claims and her needs\xe2\x80\x94well\r\nknowing that my father would never suffer Griff\xe2\x80\x99s widow to be in want.\r\n\r\nHe judged rightly.  My father was nervously anxious to arrange for giving\r\nher \xc2\xa3500 a year, in the manner most likely to prevent her from making\r\naway with it, and leaving herself destitute.  But there had already been\r\nheavy pulls on his funded property, and ways and means had to be\r\nconsidered, making Clarence realise that he had become the heir.\r\nSomehow, there still remained, especially with my mother and himself, a\r\nsense of his being a failure, and an inferior substitute, although my\r\nfather had long come to lean upon him, as never had been the case with\r\nour poor Griff.\r\n\r\nThe first idea of raising the amount required was by selling an outlying\r\nbit of the estate near the Wattlesea Station, for which an enterprising\r\nbuilder was making offers, either to purchase or take on a building\r\nlease.  My father had received several letters on the subject, and only\r\nhesitated from a feeling against breaking up the estate, especially if\r\nthis were part of the original Chantry House property, and not a more\r\nrecent acquisition of the Winslows.  Moreover, he would do nothing\r\nwithout Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s participation.\r\n\r\nThe title-deeds were not in the house, for my father had had too much of\r\nthe law to meddle more than he could help with his own affairs, and had\r\nleft them in the hands of the family solicitor at Bristol, where Clarence\r\nwas to go and look over them.  He rejoiced in the opportunity of being\r\nable to see whether anything would throw light on the story of the\r\nmullion chamber; and the certainty that the Wattlesea property had never\r\nbeen part of the old endowment of the Chantry did not seem nearly so\r\ninteresting as a packet of yellow letters tied with faded red tape.  Mr.\r\nRyder made no difficulty in entrusting these to him, and we read them by\r\nour midnight lamp.\r\n\r\nClarence had seen poor Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s will, bequeathing her entire property\r\nto her husband\xe2\x80\x99s son, Philip Winslow, and had noted the date, 1705; also\r\nthe copy of the decision in the Court of Probate that there was no\r\nsufficient evidence of entail on the Fordyce family to bar her power of\r\ndisposing of it.  We eagerly opened the letters, but found them\r\ndisappointing, as they were mostly offerings of \xe2\x80\x98Felicitations\xe2\x80\x99 to Philip\r\nWinslow on having established his \xe2\x80\x98Just Claim,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98refuted the\r\nmalicious Accusations of Calumny.\xe2\x80\x99  They only served to prove the fact\r\nthat he had been accused of something, and likewise that he had powerful\r\nfriends, and was thought worth being treated with adulation, according to\r\nthe fashion of his day.  Perhaps it was hardly to be expected that he\r\nshould have preserved evidence against himself, but it was baffling to\r\nsift so little out of such a mass of correspondence.  If we could have\r\nhad access to the Fordyce papers, no doubt they would have given the\r\nother phase of the transaction, but they were unattainable.  The only\r\npublic record that Clarence could discover was much abbreviated, and\r\nthough there was some allusion to intimidation, the decision seemed to\r\nhave been fixed by the non-existence of any entail.\r\n\r\nChristmas was drawing on, and gathering together what was left of us.\r\nThough Griffith had spent only one Christmas at home in nine years, it\r\nwas wonderful how few we seemed, even when Martyn returned.  My father\r\nliked to have us about him, and even spoke of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s giving up his\r\npost as manager at Bristol, and living entirely at home to attend to the\r\nestate; but my mother did not encourage the idea.  She could not quite\r\nbear to accept any one in Griff\xe2\x80\x99s place, and rightly thought there was\r\nnot occupation enough to justify bringing Clarence home.  I was competent\r\nto assist my father through all the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s business that came to him\r\nwithin doors, and Emily had ridden and walked about enough with him to be\r\nan efficient inspector of crops and repairs, besides that Clarence\r\nhimself was within reach.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 he said to me, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot loose my hold on Frith and Castleford\r\ntill I see my way into the future.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI did not know what he intended either then or when he gave his voice\r\nagainst dismembering the property by selling the Wattlesea estate, but\r\narranged for raising Selina\xe2\x80\x99s income otherwise, persuading my father to\r\nlet him undertake the building of the required cottages out of his own\r\nresources, on principles much more wholesome than were likely to be\r\nemployed by the speculator.  Nor did grasp what was in his mind when he\r\nmade me look out my \xe2\x80\x98ghost journal,\xe2\x80\x99 as we called my record of each\r\napparition reported in the mullion chamber or the lawn, with marks to\r\nthose about which we had no reasonable doubt.  Separately there might be\r\nexplanation, but conjointly and in connection with the date they had a\r\nremarkable force.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am resolved,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98to see whether that figure can have a\r\npurpose.  I have thought of it all those years.  It has hitherto had no\r\nfair play.  I was too much upset by the sight, and beaten by the utter\r\nincredulity of everybody else; but now I am determined to look into it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was both awe and resolution in his countenance, and I only\r\nstipulated that he should not be alone, or with no more locomotive\r\ncompanion than myself.  Martyn was as old as I had been at our former\r\nvigil, and a person to be relied on.\r\n\r\nA few months ago he would have treated the matter as a curious\r\nadventurous enterprise\xe2\x80\x94a concession to superstition or imagination; but\r\nnow he took it up with much grave earnestness.  He had been discussing\r\nthe evidence for such phenomena with friends at Oxford, and the\r\nconclusion had been that they were at times permitted, sometimes as\r\nwarnings, sometimes to accomplish the redress of a wrong, sometimes to\r\nteach us the reality of the spiritual world about us; and, likewise, that\r\nsome constitutions were more susceptible than others to these influences.\r\nOf course he had adduced all that he knew of his domestic haunted\r\nchamber, but had found himself uncertain as to the amount of direct or\r\ntrustworthy evidence.  So he eagerly read our jottings, and was very\r\nanxious to keep watch with Clarence, though there were greater\r\ndifficulties in the way than when the outer chamber was Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting-room, and always had a fire lighted.\r\n\r\nTo our disappointment, likewise, there came an invitation from the\r\nEastwoods for the evening of the 27th of December, the second of the\r\nrecurring days of the phantom\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.  My father could not, and my\r\nmother would not go, but they so much wanted my brothers and sister to\r\naccept it that it could not well be declined.  It was partly a political\r\naffair, and my father was anxious to put Clarence forward, and make him\r\ntake his place as the future squire; and my mother thought depression had\r\nlasted long enough with her children, and did not like to see Martyn so\r\ngrave and preoccupied.  \xe2\x80\x98It was quite right and very nice in him, dear\r\nboy, but it was not natural at his age, though he was to be a clergyman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs to Emily, her gentle cheerfulness had helped us all through our time\r\nof sorrow, and just now we had been gratified by the tidings of young\r\nLawrence Frith.  That youth was doing extremely well.  There had been\r\ngolden reports from manager and chaplain, addressed to Mr. Castleford,\r\nthe latter adding that the young man evidently owed much to Mr. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninfluence.  Moreover, Lawrence had turned out an excellent correspondent.\r\nLong letters, worthy of forming a book of travels, came regularly to\r\nClarence and me, indeed they were thought worth being copied into that\r\nfat clasped MS. book in the study.  Writing them must have been a real\r\nsolace to the exile, in his island outside the town, whither all the\r\nouter barbarians were relegated.  So, no doubt, was the packing of the\r\ngifts that were gradually making Prospect Cottage into a Chinese\r\nexhibition of nodding mandarins, ivory balls, exquisite little cups, and\r\nfaggots of tea.  Also, a Chinese walking doll was sent humbly as an\r\noffering for the amusement of Miss Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s school children, whom indeed\r\nshe astonished beyond measure; and though her wheels are out of order,\r\nand her movements uncertain, she is still a stereotyped incident in the\r\nChristmas entertainments.\r\n\r\nThere was no question but that these letters and remembrances gave great\r\npleasure to Emily; but I believe she was not in the least conscious that\r\nthough greater in degree, it was not of the same quality as that she felt\r\nwhen a runaway scholar who had gone to sea presented her in token of\r\ngratitude with a couple of dried sea-horses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nTHE MIDNIGHT CHASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98What human creature in the dead of night\r\n       Had coursed, like hunted hare, that cruel distance,\r\n    Had sought the door, the window in her flight\r\n       Striving for dear existence?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                     HOOD.\r\n\r\nON the night of the 26th of December, Clarence and Martyn, well wrapped\r\nin greatcoats, stole into the outer mullion room; but though the usual\r\nsounds were heard, and the mysterious light again appeared, Martyn\r\nperceived nothing else, and even Clarence declared that if there were\r\nanything besides, it was far less distinct to him than it had been\r\npreviously.  Could it be that his spiritual perceptions were growing\r\ndimmer as he became older, and outgrew the sensitiveness of nerves and\r\nimagination?\r\n\r\nWe came to the conclusion that it would be best to watch the outside of\r\nthe house, rather than within the chamber; and the dinner-party\r\nfacilitated this, since it accounted for being up and about nearer to the\r\nhour when the ghost might be expected.  Egress could be had through the\r\nlittle garden door, and I undertook to sit up and keep up the fire.\r\n\r\nAll three came to my room on their return home, for Emily had become\r\naware of our scheme, and entreated to be allowed to watch with us.\r\nClarence had unfastened the alarum bell from my shutters, and taken down\r\nthe bar after the curtains had been drawn by the housemaid, and he now\r\nopened them.  It was a frosty moonlight night, and the lawn lay white and\r\ncrisp, marked with fantastic shadows.  The others looked grave and pale,\r\nEmily was in a thick white shawl and hood, with a swan\xe2\x80\x99s down boa over\r\nher black dress, a somewhat ghostly figure herself, but we were in far\r\ntoo serious a mood for light observations.\r\n\r\nThere was something of a shudder about Clarence as he went to unbolt the\r\nback door; Martyn kept close to him.  We saw them outside, and then Emily\r\nflew after them.  From my window I could watch them advancing on the\r\ncentral gravel walk, Emily standing still between her brothers, clasping\r\nan arm of each.  I saw the light near the ruin, and caught some sounds as\r\nof shrieks and of threatening voices, the light flitted towards the gable\r\nof the mullion rooms, and then was the concluding scream.  All was over,\r\nand the three came back much agitated, Emily sinking into an armchair,\r\npanting, her hands over her face, and a nervous trembling through her\r\nwhole frame, Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looking wide and scared, Clarence with the\r\nwell-known look of terror on his face.  He hurried to fetch the tray of\r\nwine and water that was always left on the table when anyone went to a\r\nparty at night, but he shivered too much to prevent the glasses from\r\njingling, and I had to pour out the sherry and administer it to Emily.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! poor, poor thing,\xe2\x80\x99 she gasped out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You saw?\xe2\x80\x99 I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98They did,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martyn; \xe2\x80\x98I only saw the light, and heard!  That was\r\nenough!\xe2\x80\x99 and he shuddered again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then Emily did,\xe2\x80\x99 I began, but Clarence cut me short.  \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask her\r\nto-night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! let me tell,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Emily; \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t go away to bed till I have had\r\nit out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she gave the details, which were the more notable because she had\r\nnot, like Martyn, been studying our jottings, and had heard comparatively\r\nlittle of the apparition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When I joined the boys,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I looked toward the mullion rooms; I\r\nsaw the windows lighted up, and heard a sobbing and crying inside.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So did I,\xe2\x80\x99 put in Martyn, and Clarence bent his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 added Emily, \xe2\x80\x98by the moonlight I saw the gable end, not blank,\r\nand covered by the magnolia as it is now, but with stone steps up to the\r\nbricked-up doorway.  The door opened, the light spread, and there came\r\nout a lady in black, with a lamp in one hand, and a kind of parcel in the\r\nother, and oh, when she turned her face this way, it was Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98So you called out,\xe2\x80\x99 whispered Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear Ellen, not as she used to be,\xe2\x80\x99 added Emily, \xe2\x80\x98but like what she was\r\nwhen last I saw her; no, hardly that either, for this was sad, sad,\r\nscared, terrified, with eyes all tears, as Ellen never, never was.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I saw,\xe2\x80\x99 added Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98I saw the shape, but not the countenance and\r\nexpression as I used to do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                     [Picture: Lady Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s ghost]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98She came down the steps,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Emily, \xe2\x80\x98looking about her as if\r\nmaking her escape, but, just as she came opposite to us, there was a\r\nsound of tipsy laughing and singing from the gate up by the wood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought it real,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 continued Emily, \xe2\x80\x98she wavered, then turned and went under an arch\r\nin the ruin\xe2\x80\x94I fancied she was hiding something\xe2\x80\x94then came out and fled\r\nacross to the steps; but there were two dark men rushing after her, and\r\nat the stone steps there was a frightful shriek, and then it was all\r\nover, the steps gone, all quiet, and the magnolia leaves glistening in\r\nthe moonshine.  Oh! what can it all mean?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Went under the arch,\xe2\x80\x99 repeated Clarence.  \xe2\x80\x98Is it what she hid there that\r\nkeeps her from resting?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then you believe it really happened?\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily, \xe2\x80\x98that some terrible\r\nscene is being acted over again.  Oh! but can it be the real spirits!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is one of the great mysteries,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Martyn; \xe2\x80\x98but I could tell\r\nyou of other instances.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t now,\xe2\x80\x99 I interposed; \xe2\x80\x98Emily has had quite enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe reminded her that the ghastly tragedy was over and would not recur\r\nagain for another year; but she was greatly shaken, and we were very\r\nsorry for her, when the clock warned her to go to her own room, whither\r\nMartyn escorted her.  He lighted every candle he could find, and revived\r\nthe fire; but she was sadly overcome by what she had witnessed, she lay\r\nawake all the rest of the night, and in the morning, looked so unwell,\r\nand had so little to tell about the party that my mother thought her\r\nspirits had been too much broken for gaieties.\r\n\r\nThe real cause could not be confessed, for it would have been ascribed to\r\nsome kind of delirium, and have made a commotion for which my father was\r\nunfit.  Besides, we had reached an age when, though we would not have\r\ndisobeyed, liberty of thought and action had become needful.  All our\r\nprivate confabulations were on this extraordinary scene.  We looked for\r\nthe arch in the ruin, but there was, as our morning senses told us,\r\nnothing of the kind.  She tried to sketch her remembrance of both that\r\nand the gable of the mullion chamber, and Martyn prowled about in search\r\nof some hiding-place.  Our antiquarian friend, Mr. Stafford, had made a\r\nconjectural drawing of the Chapel restored, and all the portfolios about\r\nthe house were searched for it, disquieting mamma, who suspected Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nOxford notions of intending to rebuild it, nor would he say that it ought\r\nnot to be done.  However, he with his more advanced ecclesiology,\r\npronounced Mr. Stafford\xe2\x80\x99s reconstruction to be absolutely mistaken and\r\nimpossible, and set to work on a fresh plan, which, by the bye, he\r\nderides at present.  It afforded, however, an excuse for routing under\r\nthe ivy and among the stones, but without much profit.  From the\r\nmouldings on the materials and in the stables and the front porch, it was\r\nevident that the chapel had been used as a quarry, and Emily\xe2\x80\x99s arch was\r\nvery probably that of the entrance door.  In a dry summer, the\r\nfoundations of the walls and piers could be traced on the turf, and the\r\nstumps of one or two columns remained, but the rest was only a confused\r\nheap of fragments within which no one could have entered as in that\r\nstrange vision.\r\n\r\nAnother thing became clear.  There had once been a wall between the beech\r\nwood and the lawn, with a gate or door in it; Chapman could just remember\r\nits being taken down, in James Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s early married life, when\r\nlandscape gardening was the fashion.  It must have been through this that\r\nthe Winslow brothers were returning, when poor Margaret perhaps expected\r\nthem to enter by the front.\r\n\r\nWe wished we could have consulted Dame Dearlove, but she had died a few\r\nyears before, and her school was extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nWILLS OLD AND NEW.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98And that to-night thou must watch with me\r\n       To win the treasure of the tomb.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                    SCOTT.\r\n\r\nSOME seasons seem to be peculiarly marked, as if Death did indeed walk\r\nforth in them.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Frith died in the spring of 1841, and it proved that he had shown\r\nhis gratitude to Clarence by a legacy of shares in the firm amounting to\r\nabout \xc2\xa32000.  The rest of his interest therein went to Lawrence Frith,\r\nand his funded property to his sister, Mrs. Stevens, a very fair and\r\nupright disposition of his wealth.\r\n\r\nOnly six weeks later, my father had a sudden seizure, and there was only\r\ntime to summon Clarence from London and Martyn from Oxford, before a\r\nsecond attack closed his righteous and godly career upon earth.\r\n\r\nMy mother was very still and calm, hardly shedding a tear, but her whole\r\ndemeanour was as if life were over for her, and she had nothing to do\r\nsave to wait.  She seemed to care very little for tendernesses or\r\nattentions on our part.  No doubt she would have been more desolate\r\nwithout them, but we always had a baffled feeling, as though our\r\naffection were contrasted with her perfect union with her husband.  Yet\r\nthey had been a singularly undemonstrative couple; I never saw a kiss\r\npass between them, except as greeting or farewell before or after a\r\njourney; and if my mother could not use the terms papa or your father,\r\nshe always said, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Winslow.\xe2\x80\x99  There was a large gathering at the\r\nfuneral, including Mr. Fordyce, but he slept at Hillside, and we scarcely\r\nsaw him\xe2\x80\x94only for a few kind words and squeezes of the hand.  Holy Week\r\nwas begun, and he had to hurry back to Beachharbour that very night.\r\n\r\nThe will had been made on my father\xe2\x80\x99s coming into the inheritance.  It\r\nprovided a jointure of \xc2\xa3800 per annum for my mother, and gave each of the\r\nyounger children \xc2\xa33000.  A codicil had been added shortly after\r\nGriffith\xe2\x80\x99s death, written in my father\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and witnessed by Mr.\r\nHenderson and Amos Bell.  This put Clarence in the position of heir;\r\nsecured \xc2\xa3500 a year to Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s widow, charged on the estate, and\r\nlikewise an additional \xc2\xa3200 a year to Emily and to me, hers till\r\nmarriage, mine for life, \xc2\xa3300 a year to Martyn, until Earlscombe Rectory\r\nshould be voided, when it was to be offered to him.  The executors had\r\noriginally been Mr. Castleford and my mother, but by this codicil,\r\nClarence was substituted for the former.\r\n\r\nThe legacies did not come out of the Chantry House property, for my\r\nfather had, of course, means of his own besides, and bequests had accrued\r\nto both him and my mother; but Clarence was inheriting the estate much\r\nmore burthened than it had been in 1829, having \xc2\xa32000 a year to raise out\r\nof its proceeds.\r\n\r\nMy mother was quite equal to business, with a sort of outside sense,\r\nwhich she applied to it when needful.  Clarence made it at once evident\r\nto her that she was still mistress of Chantry House, and that it was\r\nstill to be our home; and she immediately calculated what each ought to\r\ncontribute to the housekeeping.  She looked rather blank when she found\r\nthat Clarence did not mean to give up business, nor even to become a\r\nsleeping partner; but when she examined into ways and means, she allowed\r\nthat he was prudent, and that perhaps it was due to Mr. Castleford not to\r\ndeprive him of an efficient helper under present circumstances.  Meantime\r\nshe was content to do her best for Earlscombe \xe2\x80\x98for the present,\xe2\x80\x99 by which\r\nshe meant till her son brought home a wife; but we knew that to him the\r\nwords bore a different meaning, though he was still in doubt and\r\nuncertainty how to act, and what might be the wrong to be undone.\r\n\r\nHe was anxious to persuade her to go from home for a short time, and\r\nprevailed on her at last to take Emily and me to Dawlish, while the\r\nrepairs went on which had been deferred during my father\xe2\x80\x99s feebleness; at\r\nleast that was the excuse.  We two, going with great regret, knew that\r\nhis real reason was to have an opportunity for a search among the ruins.\r\n\r\nIt was in June, just as Martyn came back from Oxford, eager to share in\r\nthe quest.  Those two brothers would trust no one to help them, but one\r\nby one, in the long summer evenings, they moved each of those stones; I\r\nbelieve the servants thought they were crazed, but they could explain\r\nwith some truth that they wanted to clear up the disputed points as to\r\nthe architecture, as indeed they succeeded in doing.\r\n\r\nThey had, however, nearly given up, having reached the original pavement\r\nand disinterred the piscina of the side altar, also a beautiful coffin\r\nlid with a floriated cross; when, in a kind of hollow, Martyn lit upon\r\nthe rotten remains of something silken, knotted together.  It seemed to\r\nhave enclosed a bundle.  There were some rags that might have been a\r\nchange of clothing, also a Prayer-book, decayed completely except the\r\nleathern covering, inside which was the startling inscription, \xe2\x80\x98Margaret\r\nWinslow, her booke; Lord, have mercy on a miserable widow woman.\xe2\x80\x99  There\r\nwas also a thick leathern roll, containing needles, pins, and scissors,\r\nentirely corroded, and within these a paper, carefully folded, but almost\r\ndestroyed by the action of damp and the rust of the steel, so that only\r\nthus much was visible.  \xe2\x80\x98I, Margaret Winslow, being of sound mind, do\r\nhereby give and bequeath\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen came stains that defaced every line, till the extreme end, where a\r\nseal remained; the date 1707 was legible, and there were some scrawls,\r\nprobably the poor lady\xe2\x80\x99s signature, and perhaps that of witnesses.\r\nClarence and Martyn said very little to one another, but they set out for\r\nDawlish the next day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Found\xe2\x80\x99 was indicated to us, but no more, for they arrived late, and had\r\nto sleep at the hotel, after an evening when we were delighted to hear my\r\nmother ask so many questions about household and parish affairs.  In the\r\nmorning she was pleased to send all \xe2\x80\x98the children\xe2\x80\x99 out on the beach, then\r\nfree from the railway.  It was a beautiful day, with the intensely blue\r\nSouth Devon sea dancing in golden ripples, and breaking on the shore with\r\nthe sound Clarence loved so well, as, in the shade of the dark crimson\r\ncliffs, Emily sat at my feet and my brothers unfolded their strange\r\ndiscoveries into her lap.  There was a kind of solemnity in the thing; we\r\nscarcely spoke, except that Emily said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, will she come again,\xe2\x80\x99 and,\r\nas the tears gathered at sight of the pathetic petition in the old book,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Was that granted?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe reconstructed our theory.  The poor lady must have repented of the\r\nunjust will forced from her by her stepsons, and contrived to make\r\nanother; but she must have been kept a captive until, during their\r\nabsence at some Christmas convivialities, she tried to escape; but\r\nhearing sounds betokening their return, she had only time to hide the\r\nbundle in the ruin before she was detected, and in the scuffle received a\r\nfatal blow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But why,\xe2\x80\x99 I objected, \xe2\x80\x98did she not remain hidden till her enemies were\r\nsafe in the house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Terrified beyond the use of her senses,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By all accounts,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martyn, \xe2\x80\x98the poor creature must have been rather\r\na silly woman.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98For shame, Martyn,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Emily, \xe2\x80\x98how can you tell?  They might have\r\nseen her go in, or she might have feared being missed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Or if you watch next Christmas you may see it all explained.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTo which Emily replied with a shiver that nothing would induce her to go\r\nthrough it again, and indeed she hoped the spirit would rest since the\r\ndiscovery had been made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And then?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94one of us said, and there was a silence, and another futile\r\nattempt to read the will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I shall take it to London and see what an expert can do with it,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nClarence.  \xe2\x80\x98I have heard of wonderful decipherings in the Record Office;\r\nbut you will remember that even if it can be made out, it will hardly\r\ninvalidate our possession after a hundred and thirty years.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Clarence!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Emily in a horrified voice; and I asked if the date\r\nwere not later than that by which we inherited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Three years,\xe2\x80\x99 Clarence said, \xe2\x80\x98yes; but as things stand, it is absolutely\r\nimpossible for me to make restitution at present.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98On account of the burthens on the estate?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, but we could give up,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I dare say!\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, smiling; \xe2\x80\x98but to say nothing of poor Selina,\r\nmy mother would hardly see it in the same light, nor should I deal\r\nrightly, even if I could make any alterations; I doubt whether my father\r\nwould have held himself bound\xe2\x80\x94certainly not while no one can read this\r\ndocument.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would simply outrage his legal mind,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then what is to be done?  Is the injustice to be perpetual?\xe2\x80\x99 asked\r\nEmily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This is what I have thought of,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.  \xe2\x80\x98We must leave matters\r\nas they are till I can realise enough either to pay off all these\r\nbequests, or to offer Mr. Fordyce the value of the estate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is not the whole,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not the Wattlesea part.  This means Chantry House and the three farms in\r\nthe village.  \xc2\xa310,000 would cover it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Emily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 returned Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98God helping me.  You know our concern is\r\nbringing in good returns, and Mr. Castleford will put me in the way of\r\ndoing more with my available capital.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will save so as to help you!\xe2\x80\x99 added Emily.  At which he smiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nON A SPREE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Her eyes as stars of twilight fair,\r\n    Like twilight too, her dusky hair,\r\n    But all things else about her drawn\r\n    From May-time and the cheerful dawn,\r\n    A dancing shape, an image gay,\r\n    To haunt, to startle, and waylay.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                               WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE went to London according to his determination, and as he had for\r\nsome time been urgent that I should try some newly-invented mechanical\r\nappliances, he took me with him, this being the last expedition of the\r\nancient yellow chariot.  One of his objects was that I should see St.\r\nPaul\xe2\x80\x99s, Knightsbridge, which was then the most distinguished church of\r\nour school of thought, and where there was to be some special preaching.\r\nThe Castlefords had a seat there, and I was settled there in good time,\r\nlooking at the few bits of stained glass then in the east window, when,\r\nas the clergy came in from the vestry, I beheld a familiar face, and\r\nrecognised the fine countenance and bearing of our dear old friend Frank\r\nFordyce.\r\n\r\nThen, looking at the row of ladies in front of me, I beheld for a moment\r\nan outline of a profile recalling many things.  No doubt, Anne Fordyce\r\nwas there, though instead of barely emulating my stunted stature, she\r\ntowered above her companions, looking to my mind most fresh and graceful\r\nin her pretty summer dress; and I knew that Clarence saw her too.\r\n\r\nI had never heard Mr. Fordyce preach before, as in his flying visits his\r\nministrations were due at Hillside; and I certainly should have been\r\nstruck with the force and beauty of his sermon if I had never known him\r\nbefore.  It was curious that it was on the 49th Psalm, meant perhaps for\r\nthe fashionable congregation, but remarkably chiming in with the feelings\r\nof us, who were conscious of an inheritance of evil from one who had\r\n\xe2\x80\x98done well unto himself;\xe2\x80\x99 though, no doubt, that was the last thing\r\nhonest Parson Frank was thinking of.\r\n\r\nWhen the service was over, and Anne turned, she became aware of us, and\r\nher face beamed all over.  It was a charming face, with a general\r\nlikeness to dear Ellen\xe2\x80\x99s, but without the fragile ethereal look, and all\r\nhealth, bloom, and enjoyment recalling her father\xe2\x80\x99s.  She was only moving\r\nto let her pew-fellows pass out, and was waiting for him to come for her,\r\nas he did in a few moments, and he too was all pleasure and cordiality.\r\nHe told us when we were outside that he had come up to preach, and \xe2\x80\x98had\r\nbrought Miss Anne up for a spree.\xe2\x80\x99  They were at a hotel, Mrs. Fordyce\r\nwas at home, and the Lesters were not in town this season\xe2\x80\x94a matter of\r\nrejoicing to us.  Could we not come home and dine with them at once?  We\r\nwere too much afraid of disappointing Gooch to do so, but they made an\r\nappointment to meet us at the Royal Academy as soon as it was open the\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nThere was a fortnight of enjoyment.  Parson Frank was like a boy out for\r\na holiday.  He had not spent more than a day or two in town for many\r\nyears; Anne had not been there since early childhood, and they adopted\r\nClarence as their lioniser, going through such a country-cousin course of\r\ndelights as in that memorable time with Ellen.  They even went down to\r\nEton and Windsor, Frank Fordyce being an old Etonian.  I doubt whether\r\nClarence ever had a more thoroughly happy time, not even in the north of\r\nDevon, for there was no horse on his mind, and he was not suppressed as\r\nin those days.  Indeed, I believe, it is the experience of others besides\r\nourselves that there is often more unmixed pleasure on casual holidays\r\nlike this than in those of early youth; for even if spirits are less high\r\n(which is not always the case), anticipations are less eager, there is\r\nmore readiness to accept whatever comes, more matured appreciation, and\r\nless fret and friction at _contretemps_.\r\n\r\nI was not much of a drag, for when I could not be with the others, I had\r\nold friends, and the museum was as dear to me as ever, in those recesses\r\nthat had been the paradise of my youth; but there was a good deal in\r\nwhich we could all share, and as usual they were all kind consideration.\r\n\r\nAnne overflowed with minute remembrances of her old home, and Clarence so\r\nbasked in her sunshine that it began to strike me that here might be the\r\nsolution of all the perplexities especially after the first evening, when\r\nhe had shown his strange discovery to Mr. Fordyce, who simply laughed and\r\nsaid we need not trouble ourselves about it.  Illegible was it?  He was\r\nheartily glad to hear that it was.  Even otherwise, forty years\xe2\x80\x99\r\npossession was quite enough, and then he pointed to the grate, and said\r\nthat was the best place for such things.  There was no fire, but Clarence\r\ncould hardly rescue the paper from being torn up.\r\n\r\nAs to the ghost, he knew much less than his daughter Ellen had done.  He\r\nsaid his old aunt had some stories about Chantry House being haunted, and\r\nhad thought it incumbent on her to hate the Winslows, but he had thought\r\nit all nonsense, and such stories were much better forgotten.  \xe2\x80\x98Would he\r\nnot see if there were any letters?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere might be, perhaps in the solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s office at Bath, but if he ever\r\ngot hold of them, he should certainly burn them.  What was the use of\r\nbeing Christians, if such quarrels were to be remembered?\r\n\r\nAnne knew nothing.  Aunt Peggy had died before she could remember, and\r\neven Martyn had been discreet.  Clarence said no more after that one\r\nconversation, and seemed to me engrossed between his necessary business\r\nat the office, and the pleasant expeditions with the Fordyces.  Only when\r\nthey were on the point of returning home, did he tell me that the will\r\nhad been pronounced utterly past deciphering, and that he thought he saw\r\na way of setting all straight.  \xe2\x80\x98So do I,\xe2\x80\x99 was my rejoinder, and there\r\nmust have been a foolishly sagacious expression about me that made him\r\ncolour up, and say, \xe2\x80\x98No such thing, Edward.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t put that into my\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it there already?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It ought not to be.  It would be mere treachery in these sweet, fresh,\r\nyoung, innocent, days of hers, knowing too what her mother would think of\r\nit and of me.  Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you observe in old Frank\xe2\x80\x99s unguarded way of reading\r\nletters aloud, and then trying to suppress bits, that Mrs. Fordyce was\r\nnot at all happy at our being so much about with them, poor woman.  No\r\nwonder! the child is too young,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, showing how much, after all,\r\nhe was thinking of it.  \xe2\x80\x98It would be taking a base advantage of them\r\n_now_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But by and by?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If she should be still free when the great end is achieved and the evil\r\nrepaired, then I might dare.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe broke off with a look of glad hope, and I could see it was forbearance\r\nrather than constitutional diffidence that withheld him from awakening\r\nthe maiden\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.  He was a very fine looking man, in his\r\nprime\xe2\x80\x94tall, strong, and well made, with a singularly grave, thoughtful\r\nexpression, and a rare but most winning smile; and Anne was overflowing\r\nwith affectionate gladness at intercourse with one who belonged to the\r\ngolden age of her childhood.  I could scarcely believe but that in the\r\nfriction of the parting the spark would be elicited, and I should even\r\nhave liked to kindle it for them myself, being tolerably certain that\r\nwarm-hearted, unguarded Parson Frank would forget all about his lady and\r\nblow it with all his might.\r\n\r\nWe dined with the Fordyces at their hotel, and sat in the twilight with\r\nthe windows open, and we made Anne and Clarence sing, as both could do\r\nwithout notes, but he would not undertake to remember anything with an\r\natom of sentiment in it, and when Anne did sing, \xe2\x80\x98Auld lang syne,\xe2\x80\x99 with\r\nall her heart, he went and got into a dark corner, and barely said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot a definite answer could be extracted from him in reply to all the\r\nwarm invitations to Beachharbour that were lavished on us by the father,\r\nwhile the daughter expatiated on its charms; the rocks I might sketch,\r\nthe waves and the delicious boating, and above all the fisher children\r\nand the church.  Nothing was wanting but to have us all there!  Why had\r\nwe not brought Mrs. Winslow, and Emily, and Martyn, instead of going to\r\nDawlish?\r\n\r\nGood creatures, they little knew the chill that had been cast upon\r\nMartyn.  They even bemoaned the having seen so little of him.  And we\r\nknew all the time that they were mice at play in the absence of their\r\nexcellent and cautious cat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now mind you do come!\xe2\x80\x99 said Anne, as we were in the act of taking leave.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be as good as Hillside to have you by my Lion rock.  He has a\r\nnose just like old Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s, and you must sketch it before it crumbles\r\noff.  Yes, and I want to show you all the dear old things you made for my\r\nbaby-house after the fire, your dear little wardrobe and all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe was coming out with us, oblivious that a London hotel was not like\r\nher own free sea-side house.  Her father was out at the carriage door,\r\nprepared to help me in, Clarence halted a moment\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Please, pray, go back, Anne,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and his voice trembled.  \xe2\x80\x98This is\r\nnot home you know.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe started back, but paused.  \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll not forget.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh no; no fear of my forgetting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd when seated beside me, he leant back with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How could you help?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How?  Why the perfect, innocent, childish, unconsciousness of the\r\nthing,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and became silent except for one murmur on the way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Consequences must be borne\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nTHE PRICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98With thee, my bark, I\xe2\x80\x99ll swiftly go\r\n       Athwart the foaming brine.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                               LORD BYRON.\r\n\r\nCLARENCE would not tell me his purpose, he said, till he had considered\r\nit more fully; nor could we have much conversation on the way home, as my\r\nmother had arranged that we should bring an old friend of hers back with\r\nus to pay her a visit.  So I had to sit inside and make myself agreeable\r\nto Mrs. Wrightson, while Clarence had plenty of leisure for meditation\r\noutside on the box seat.  The good lady said much on the desirableness of\r\nmarriage for Clarence, and the comfort it would be to my mother to see\r\nEmily settled.\r\n\r\nWe had heard much in town of railway shares; and the fortunes of Hudson,\r\nthe railway king, were under discussion.  I suspected Clarence of\r\ncogitating the using his capital in this manner; and hoped that when he\r\nsaw his way, he might not think it dishonourable to come into further\r\ncontact with Anne, and reveal his hopes.  He allowed that he was\r\nconsidering of such investments, but would not say any more.\r\n\r\nMy mother and Emily had, in the meantime, been escorted home by Martyn.\r\nThe first thing Clarence did was to bespeak Emily\xe2\x80\x99s company in a turn in\r\nthe garden.  What passed then I never knew nor guessed for years after.\r\nHe consulted her whether, in case he were absent from England for five,\r\nseven, or ten years, she would be equal to the care of my mother and me.\r\nMartyn, when ordained, would have duties elsewhere, and could only be\r\nreckoned upon in emergencies.  My mother, though vigorous and practical,\r\nhad shown symptoms of gout, and if she were ill, I could hardly have done\r\nmuch for her; and on the other hand, though my health and powers of\r\nmoving were at their best, and I was capable of the headwork of the\r\nestate, I was scarcely fit to be the representative member of the family.\r\nMoreover, these good creatures took into consideration that poor mamma\r\nand I would have been rather at a loss as each other\xe2\x80\x99s sole companions.\r\nI could sort shades for her Berlin work, and even solve problems of\r\nintricate knitting, and I could read to her in the evening; but I could\r\nnot trot after her to her garden, poultry-yard, and cottages; nor could\r\nshe enter into the pursuits that Emily had shared with me for so many\r\nyears.  Our connecting link, that dear sister, knew how sorely she would\r\nbe missed, and she told Clarence that she felt fully competent to\r\nundertake, conjointly with us, all that would be incumbent on Chantry\r\nHouse, if he really wanted to be absent.  For the rest, Clarence believed\r\nmy mother would be the happier for being left regent over the estate; and\r\nhis scheme broke upon me that very forenoon, when my mother and he were\r\nsettling some executor\xe2\x80\x99s business together, and he told her that Mr.\r\nCastleford wished him to go out to Hong Kong, which was then newly ceded\r\nto the English, and where the firm wished to establish a house of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t think of it,\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, and the sound fell like a knell\r\non my ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think I must,\xe2\x80\x99 was his answer.  \xe2\x80\x98We shall be cut out if we do not get\r\na footing there, and there is no one who can quite answer the purpose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Not that young Frith\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ten to one but he is on his way home.  Besides, if not, he has his own\r\nwork at Canton.  We see our way to very considerable advantages, if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Advantages!\xe2\x80\x99 she interrupted.  \xe2\x80\x98I hate speculation.  I should have\r\nthought you might be contented with your station; but that is the worst\r\nof merchants,\xe2\x80\x94they never know when to stop.  I suppose your ambition is\r\nto make this a great overgrown mansion, so that your father would not\r\nknow it again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Certainly not that, mamma,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence smiling; \xe2\x80\x98it is the last thing\r\nI should think of; but stopping would in this case mean going backward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why can\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Castleford send one of his own sons?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Probably Walter may come out by and by, but he has not experience enough\r\nfor this.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nClarence had not in the least anticipated my mother\xe2\x80\x99s opposition, for he\r\nhad come to underestimate her affection for and reliance on him.  He had\r\nus all against him, for not only could we not bear to part with him; but\r\nthe climate of Hong-Kong was in evil repute, and I had become persuaded\r\nthat, with his knowledge of business, railway shares and scrip might be\r\nmade to realise the amount needed, but he said, \xe2\x80\x98That is what _I_ call\r\nspeculation.  The other matter is trade in which, with Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s blessing,\r\nI can hope to prosper.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe explained that Mr. Castleford had received him on his coming to London\r\nwith almost a request that he would undertake this expedition; but with\r\nfears whether, in his new position, he could or would do so, although his\r\npresence in China would be very important to the firm at this juncture;\r\nand there would be opportunities which would probably result in very\r\nconsiderable profits after a few years.  If Clarence had been, as before,\r\na mere younger brother, it would have been thought an excellent chance;\r\nand he would almost have felt bound by his obligations to Mr. Castleford\r\nto undertake the first starting of the enterprise, if it had not been for\r\nour recent loss, and the doubt whether he could he spared from home.\r\n\r\nHe made light of the dangers of climate.  He had never suffered in that\r\nway in his naval days, and scarcely knew what serious illness meant.\r\nIndeed, he had outgrown much of that sensibility of nerve which had made\r\nhim so curiously open to spiritual or semi-spiritual impressions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Any way,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98the thing is right to be done, provided my mother\r\ndoes not make an absolute point of my giving it up; and whether she does\r\nor not depends a good deal on how you others put it to her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Right on Mr. Castleford\xe2\x80\x99s account?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is one side of it.  To refuse would put him in a serious\r\ndifficulty; but I could perhaps come home sooner if it were not for this\r\nother matter.  I told him so far as that it was an object with me to\r\nraise this sum in a few years, and he showed me how there is every\r\nlikelihood of my being able to do so out there.  So now I feel in your\r\nhands.  If you all, and Edward chiefly, set to and persuade my mother\r\nthat this undertaking is a dangerous business, and that I can only be led\r\nto it by inordinate love of riches\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, no\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s what she thinks,\xe2\x80\x99 pursued Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98and that I want to be a\r\ngrander man than my father.  That\xe2\x80\x99s at the bottom of her mind, I see.\r\nWell, if you deplore this, and let her think the place can\xe2\x80\x99t do without\r\nme, she will come out in her strength and make it my duty to stay at\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It is very tempting,\xe2\x80\x99 said Emily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We all undertook to give up something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We never thought it would come in this way!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We never do,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 said Martyn, \xe2\x80\x98is this to content that ghost, poor thing?  For\r\nit is very hard to believe in her, except in the mullion room in\r\nDecember.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Exactly so, Martyn,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered.  \xe2\x80\x98Impressions fade, and the intellect\r\nfails to accept them.  But I do not think that is my motive.  We know\r\nthat a wicked deed was done by our ancestor, and we hardly have the right\r\nto pray, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember not the sins of our forefathers,\xe2\x80\x9d unless, now that we\r\nknow the crime, we attempt what restitution in us lies.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting after this appeal, and after the first shock, my\r\nmother was ready to admit that as Clarence owed everything to Mr.\r\nCastleford, he could not well desert the firm, if it were really needful\r\nfor its welfare that he should go out.  We got her to look on Mr.\r\nCastleford as captain of the ship, and Clarence as first lieutenant; and\r\nwhen she was once convinced that he did not want to aggrandise the\r\nfamily, but to do his duty, she dropped her objections; and we soon saw\r\nthat the occupations that his absence would impose on her would be a\r\nfresh interest in life.\r\n\r\nJust as the decision was thus ratified, a packet from Canton arrived for\r\nClarence from Bristol.  It was the first reply of young Frith to the\r\ntidings of the bequest which had changed the poor clerk to a wealthy man,\r\nowning a large proportion of the shares of the prosperous house.\r\n\r\nI asked if he were coming home, and Clarence briefly replied that he did\r\nnot know,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98it depended\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is he going to wed a fair Chinese with lily feet?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Martyn, to\r\nwhich the reply was an unusually discourteous \xe2\x80\x98Bosh,\xe2\x80\x99 as Clarence escaped\r\nwith his letter.  He was so reticent about it that I required a solemn\r\nassurance that poor Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s head had not been turned by his fortune,\r\nand that there was nothing wrong with him.  Indeed, there was great\r\nstupidity in never guessing the purport of that thick letter, nor that it\r\ncontained one for Emily, where Lawrence Frith laid himself, and all that\r\nhe had, at her feet, ascribing to her all the resolution with which he\r\nhad kept from evil, and entreating permission to come home and endeavour\r\nto win her heart.  We lived so constantly together that it is surprising\r\nthat Clarence contrived to give the letter to Emily in private.  She\r\nimplored him to say nothing to us, and brought him the next day her\r\nletter of uncompromising refusal.\r\n\r\nHe asked whether it would have been the same if he had intended to remain\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if you were a woman, you conceited fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 was all the answer she\r\nvouchsafed him.\r\n\r\nNor could he ascertain, nor perhaps would she herself examine, on which\r\nside lay her heart of hearts.  The proof had come whether she would abide\r\nby her pledge to him to accept the care of us in his absence.  When he\r\nasked it, it had not occurred to him that it might be a renunciation of\r\nmarriage.  Now he perceived that so it had been, but she kept her counsel\r\nand so did he.  We others never guessed at what was going on between\r\nthose two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nPAYING THE COST.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98But oh! the difference to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                               WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\nSO Clarence was gone, and our new life begun in its changed aspect.\r\nEmily showed an almost feverish eagerness to make it busy and cheerful,\r\ngetting up a sewing class in the village, resuming the study of Greek,\r\ngrappling with the natural system in botany, all of which had been\r\nfitfully proposed but hindered by interruptions and my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfeebleness.\r\n\r\nOn a suggestion of Mr. Stafford\xe2\x80\x99s, we set to work on that _History of\r\nLetter Writing_ which, what with collecting materials, and making\r\ntranslations, lasted us three years altogether, and was a great resource\r\nand pleasure, besides ultimately bringing in a fraction towards the great\r\npurpose.  Emily has confessed that she worked away a good deal of vague,\r\nweary depression, and sense of monotony into those Greek choruses: but to\r\nus she was always a sunbeam, with her ever ready attention, and the\r\nplayfulness which resumed more of genuine mirth after the first effort\r\nand strain of spirits were over.\r\n\r\nThen journal-letters on either side began to bridge the gulf of\r\nseparation,\xe2\x80\x94those which, minus all the specially interesting portions,\r\nare to be seen in the volume we culled from them, and which had\r\nconsiderable success in its day.\r\n\r\nMartyn worked in the parish and read with Mr. Henderson till he was old\r\nenough for Ordination, and then took the curacy of St. Wulstan\xe2\x80\x99s, under a\r\nhardworking London vicar, and thenceforth his holidays were our\r\nfestivals.  Our old London friends pitied us for what they viewed as a\r\nfearfully dull life, and in the visits they occasionally paid us thought\r\nthey were doing us a great favour by bringing us new ideas and shooting\r\nour partridges.\r\n\r\nWe hardly deserved their compassion: our lives were full of interest to\r\nourselves\xe2\x80\x94that interest which comes of doing ever so feeble a stroke of\r\nwork in one great cause; and there was much keen participation in the\r\ngeneral life of the Church in the crisis through which she was passing.\r\nWe found that, what with drawing pictures, writing little books,\r\npreparing lessons for teachers, and much besides which is now ready done\r\nby the National Society and Sunday School Institute, we could do a good\r\ndeal to assist Martyn in his London work, and our own grew upon us.\r\n\r\nFor the first year of her widowhood, my mother shrank from society, and\r\nafterwards had only spasmodic fits of doubt whether it were not her duty\r\nto make my sister go out more.  So that now and then Emily did go to a\r\nparty, or to make a visit of some days or weeks from home, and then we\r\nknew how valuable she was.  It would be hard to say whether my mother\r\nwere relieved or disappointed when Emily refused James Eastwood, in spite\r\nof many persuasions, not only from himself, but his family.  I believe\r\nmamma thought it selfish to be glad, and that it was a failure in duty\r\nnot to have performed that weighty matter of marrying her daughter;\r\nfeeling in some way inferior to ladies who had disposed of a whole flock\r\nunder five and twenty, whereas she had not been able to get rid of a\r\nsingle one!\r\n\r\nOf Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s doings in China I need not speak; you have read of them in\r\nthe book for yourselves, and you know how his work prospered, so that the\r\nresults more than fulfilled his expectations, and raised the firm to the\r\npitch of greatness and reputation which it has ever since preserved, and\r\nthis without soiling his hands with the miserable opium traffic.  Some of\r\nthe subordinates were so set on the gains to be thus obtained, that he\r\nand Lawrence Frith had a severe struggle with them to prevent it, and\r\nwere forced conjointly to use all their authority as principals to make\r\nit impossible.  Those two were the greatest of friends.  Their chief\r\nrelaxation was one another\xe2\x80\x99s company, and their earnest aim was to\r\nsupport the Christian mission, and to keep up the tone of their English\r\ndependants, a terribly difficult matter, and one that made the time of\r\ntheir return somewhat doubtful, even when Walter Castleford was gone out\r\nto relieve them.  Their health had kept up so well that we had ceased to\r\nbe anxious on that point, and it was through the Castlefords that we\r\nreceived the first hint that Clarence might not be as well as his absence\r\nof complaint had led us to believe.\r\n\r\nIn fact he had never been well since a terrible tempest, when he had\r\nworked hard and exposed himself to save life.  I never could hear the\r\nparticulars, for Lawrence was away, and Clarence could not write about it\r\nhimself, having been prostrated by one of those chills so perilous in hot\r\ncountries; but from all I have heard, no resident in Hong-Kong would have\r\nbelieved that Mr. Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s courage could ever have been called in\r\nquestion.  He ought to have come home immediately after that attack of\r\nfever; for the five years were over, and his work nearly done; but there\r\nwas need to consolidate his achievements, and a strong man is only too\r\napt to trifle with his health.  We might have guessed something by the\r\nlanguor and brevity of his letters, but we thought the absence of detail\r\nowing to his expectation of soon seeing us; and had gone on for months\r\nexpecting the announcement of a speedy return, when an unexpected shock\r\nfell on us.  Our dear mother was still an active woman, with few signs of\r\nage about her, when, in her sixty-seventh year, she was almost suddenly\r\ntaken from us by an attack of gout in the stomach.\r\n\r\nI feel as if I had not done her justice, and as if she might seem stern,\r\nunsympathising, and lacking in tenderness.  Yet nothing could be further\r\nfrom the truth.  She was an old-fashioned mother, who held it her duty to\r\nkeep up her authority, and counted over-familiarity and indulgence as\r\nsins.  To her \xe2\x80\x98the holy spirit of discipline was the beginning of\r\nwisdom,\xe2\x80\x99 and to make her children godly, truthful, and honourable was a\r\nmuch greater object than to win their love.  And their love she had, and\r\nkept to a far higher degree than seems to be the case with those who\r\ncourt affection by caresses and indulgence.  We knew that her approval\r\nwas of a generous kind, we prized enthusiastically her rare betrayals of\r\nher motherly tenderness, and we depended on her in a manner we only\r\nrealised in the desolation, dreariness, and helplessness that fell upon\r\nus, when we knew that she was gone.  She had not, nor had any of us,\r\nunderstood that she was dying, and she had uttered only a few words that\r\ncould imply any such thought.  On hearing that there was a letter from\r\nClarence, she said, \xe2\x80\x98Poor Clarence!  I should like to have seen him.  He\r\nis a good boy after all.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hard on him, but it will all be right\r\nnow.  God Almighty bless him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat was the only formal blessing she left among us.  Indeed, the last\r\ntime I saw her was with an ordinary good-night at the foot of the stairs.\r\nEmily said she was glad that I had not to carry with me the remembrance\r\nof those paroxysms of suffering.  My dear Emily had alone the whole force\r\nof that trial\xe2\x80\x94or shall I call it privilege?  Martyn did not reach home\r\ntill some hours after all was over, poor boy.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of our desolateness, just as we had let the daylight in\r\nagain upon our diminished numbers round the table, came a letter from\r\nHong-Kong, addressed to me in Lawrence Frith\xe2\x80\x99s writing, and the first\r\nthing I saw was a scrawl, as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98DEAREST TED\xe2\x80\x94All is in your hands.  You can do _it_.  God bless you\r\n    all.  W. C. W.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen I came to myself, and could see and hear, Martyn was impressing on\r\nme that where there is life there is hope, though indeed, according to\r\npoor Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s letter, there was little of either.  He feared our\r\nhearing indirectly, and therefore wrote to prepare us.\r\n\r\nHe had been summoned to Hong-Kong to find Clarence lying desperately ill,\r\nfor the most part semi-delirious, holding converse with invisible forms,\r\nor entreating some one to let him alone\xe2\x80\x94he had done his best.  In one of\r\nhis more lucid intervals he had made Lawrence find that note in a case\r\nthat lay near him, and promise to send it; and he had tried to send some\r\nmessages, but they had become confused, and he was too weak to speak\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nThe next mail was sure to bring the last tidings of one who had given his\r\nlife for right and justice.  It was only a reprieve that what it actually\r\nbrought was the intelligence that he was still alive, and more sensible,\r\nand had been able to take much pleasure in seeing the friend of his\r\nyouth, Captain Coles, who was there with his ship, the _Douro_.  Then\r\nthere had been a relapse.  Captain Coles had brought his doctor to see\r\nhim, and it had been pronounced that the best chance of saving him was a\r\nsea-voyage.  The _Douro_ had just received orders to return to England,\r\nand Coles had offered to take home both the friends as guests, though\r\nthere was evidently little hope that our brother would reach any earthly\r\nhome.  As we knew afterwards, he had smiled and said it was like\r\nrehabilitation to have the chance of dying on board one of H.M. ships.\r\nAnd he was held in such respect, and was so entirely one of the leading\r\nmen of the little growing colony, and had been known as such a friend to\r\nthe naval men, and had so gallantly aided a Queen\xe2\x80\x99s ship in that\r\nhurricane, that his passage home in this manner only seemed a natural\r\ntribute of respect.  A few last words from Lawrence told us that he was\r\nsafely on board, all unconscious of the silent, almost weeping,\r\nprocession that had escorted his litter to the _Douro\xe2\x80\x99s_ boat, only too\r\nmuch as if it were his bier.  In fact, Captain Coles actually promised\r\nhim that if he died at sea he should be buried with the old flag.\r\n\r\nWe could not hope to hear more for at least six weeks, since our letter\r\nhad come by overland mail, and the _Douro_ would take her time.  It was a\r\ncomfort in this waiting time that Martyn could be with us.  His rector\r\nhad been promoted; there was a general change of curates; and as Martyn\r\nhad been working up to the utmost limits of his strength, we had no\r\nscruple in inducing him to remain with us, and undertake nothing fresh\r\ntill this crisis was past.  Though as to rest, not one Sunday passed\r\nwithout requests for his assistance from one or more of the neighbouring\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nACHIEVED.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98And hopes and fears that kindle hope,\r\n    An undistinguishable throng,\r\n    And gentle wishes long subdued\xe2\x80\x94\r\n    Subdued and cherished long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                          S. T. COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\nTHE first that we did hear of our brother was a letter with a Falmouth\r\npostmark, which we scarcely dared to open.  There was not much in it, but\r\nthat was enough.  \xe2\x80\x98D. G.\xe2\x80\x94I shall see you all again.  We put in at\r\nPortsmouth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no staying at home after that.  We three lost no time in\r\nstarting, for railways had become available, and by the time we had\r\ndriven from the station at Portsmouth the _Douro_ had been signalled.\r\n\r\nMartyn took a boat and went on board alone, for besides that Emily did\r\nnot like to leave me, her dress would have been a revelation that _all_\r\nwere no longer there to greet the arrival.  The precaution was, however,\r\nunnecessary.  There stood Clarence on deck, and after the first greeting,\r\nhe laid his hand on Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s arm and said, \xe2\x80\x98My mother is gone?\xe2\x80\x99 and on\r\nthe wondering assent, \xe2\x80\x98I was quite sure of it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they came ashore, Clarence lying in the man-of-war\xe2\x80\x99s boat, in which\r\nhis friend insisted on sending him, able now to give a smiling response\r\nand salute to the three cheers with which the crew took leave of him.  He\r\nwas carried up to our hotel on a stretcher by half-a-dozen blue jackets.\r\nIndeed he was grievously changed, looking so worn and weak, so\r\nhollow-eyed and yellow, and so fearfully wasted, that the very memory is\r\npainful; and able to do nothing but lie on the sofa holding Emily\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\ngazing at us with a face full of ineffable peace and gladness.  There was\r\na misgiving upon me that he had only come back to finish his work and bid\r\nus farewell.\r\n\r\nKindly and considerately they had sent him on before with Martyn.  In a\r\nquarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time his good doctor came in with Lawrence Frith, a\r\nconsiderable contrast to our poor Clarence, for the slim gypsy lad had\r\ndeveloped into a strikingly handsome man, still slender and lithe, but\r\nwith a fine bearing, and his bronzed complexion suiting well with his\r\ndark shining hair and beautiful eyes.  They had brought some of the\r\nluggage, and the doctor insisted that his patient should go to bed\r\ndirectly, and rest completely before trying to talk.\r\n\r\nThen we heard that his condition, though still anxious, was far from\r\nbeing hopeless, and that after the tropics had been passed, he had been\r\ngradually improving.  The kind doctor had got leave to go up to London\r\nwith us, and talk over the case with L---, and he hoped Clarence might be\r\nable to bear the journey by the next afternoon.\r\n\r\nPresently after came Captain Coles, whom we had not seen since the short\r\nvisit when we had idolised the big overgrown midshipman, whom Clarence\r\nexhibited to our respectful and distant admiration nearly twenty years\r\nago.  My mother used to call him a gentlemanly lad, and that was just\r\nwhat he was still, with a singularly soft gentle manner, gallant officer\r\nand post-captain as he was.  He cheered me much, for he made no doubt of\r\nClarence\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate recovery, and he added that he had found the dear\r\nfellow so valued and valuable, so useful in all good works, and so much\r\nrespected by all the English residents, \xe2\x80\x98that really,\xe2\x80\x99 said the captain,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I did not know whether to deplore that the service should have lost such\r\na man, or whether to think it had been a good thing for him, though not\r\nfor us, that\xe2\x80\x94that he got into such a scrape.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI said something of our thanks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To tell you the truth,\xe2\x80\x99 said Coles, \xe2\x80\x98I had my doubts whether it had not\r\nbeen a cruel act, for he had a terrible turn after we got him on board,\r\nand all the sounds of a Queen\xe2\x80\x99s ship revived the past associations, and\r\nalways of a painful kind in his delirium, till at last, just as I gave\r\nhim up, the whole character of his fancies seemed to change, and from\r\nthat time he has been gaining every day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe kept the captain to dinner, and gathered a good deal more\r\nunderstanding of the important position to which Clarence had risen by\r\nforce of character and rectitude of purpose in that strange little\r\nAnglo-Chinese colony; and afterwards, I was allowed to make a long visit\r\nto Clarence, who, having eaten and slept, was quite ready to talk.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the great distress of his illness had been the\r\nrecurrence\xe2\x80\x94nay, aggravation\xe2\x80\x94of the strange susceptibility of brain and\r\nnerve that had belonged to his earlier days, and with it either\r\nimagination or perception of the spirit-world.  Much that had seemed\r\ndelirium had belonged to that double consciousness, and he perfectly\r\nrecollected it.  As Coles had said, the sights and sounds of the ship had\r\nbeen a renewal of the saddest time in his life; he could not at night\r\ndivest himself of the impression that he was under arrest, and the sins\r\nof his life gathered themselves in fearful and oppressive array, as if to\r\nstifle him, and the phantom of poor Margaret with her lamp\xe2\x80\x94which had\r\nhaunted him from the beginning of his illness\xe2\x80\x94seemed to taunt him with\r\nhaving been too fainthearted and tardy to be worthy to espouse her cause.\r\nThe faith to which he tried to cling _would_ seem to fail him in those\r\nawful hours, when he could only cry out mechanical prayers for mercy.\r\nThen there had come a night when he had heard my mother say, \xe2\x80\x98All right\r\nnow; God Almighty bless him.\xe2\x80\x99  And therewith the clouds cleared from his\r\nmind.  The power of _feeling_, as well as believing in, the blotting out\r\nof sin, returned, the sense of pardon and peace calmed him, and from that\r\ntime he was fully himself again, \xe2\x80\x98though,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I knew I should not\r\nsee my mother here.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIf she could only have seen him come home under the Union Jack, cheered\r\nby sailors, and carried ashore by them, it would have been to her like\r\nrestoration.  Perhaps Clarence in his dreamy weakness had so felt it, for\r\ncertainly no other mode of return to Portsmouth, the very place of his\r\ndegradation, could so have soothed him and effaced those memories.  The\r\nEnglish sounds were a perfect charm to him, as well as to Lawrence, the\r\ncommonest street cry, the very slices of bread and butter, anything that\r\nwas not Chinese, was as water to the thirsty!  And wasted as was his\r\nface, the quiet rest and joy were ineffable.\r\n\r\nStill Portsmouth was not the best place for him, and we were glad that he\r\nwas well enough to go up to London in the afternoon; intensely delighting\r\nin the May beauty of the green meadows, and white blossoming hedgerows,\r\nand the Church towers, especially the gray massiveness of Winchester\r\nCathedral.  \xe2\x80\x98Christian tokens,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, instead of the gay, gilded\r\npagodas and quaint crumpled roofs he had left.  The soft haze seemed to\r\nbe such a rest after the glare of perpetual clearness.\r\n\r\nWe were all born Londoners, and looked at the blue fog, and the broad,\r\nmisty river, and the brooding smoke, with the affection of natives, to\r\nthe amazement of Lawrence, who had never been in town without being\r\nbrowbeaten and miserable.  That he hardly was now, as he sat beside Emily\r\nall the way up, though they did not say much to one another.\r\n\r\nHe told us it was quite a new sensation to walk into the office without\r\ntimidity, and to have no fears of a biting, crushing speech about his\r\nparents or himself; but to have the clerks getting up deferentially as\r\nsoon as he was known for Mr. Frith.  He had hardly ever been allowed by\r\nhis old uncle to come across Mr. Castleford, who was of course cordial\r\nand delighted to receive him, and, without loss of time, set forth to see\r\nClarence.\r\n\r\nThe consultation with the physician had taken place, and it was not\r\nconcealed from us that Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s health was completely shattered, and\r\nhis state still very precarious, needing the utmost care to give him any\r\nchance of recovering the effects of the last two years, when he had\r\npersevered, in spite of warning, in his eagerness to complete his\r\nundertaking, and then to secure what he had effected.  The upshot of the\r\nadvice given him was to spend the summer by the seaside, and if he had by\r\nthat time gathered strength, and surmounted the symptoms of disease, to\r\ngo abroad, as he was not likely to be able as yet to bear English cold.\r\nBusiness and cares were to be avoided, and if he had anything necessary\r\nto be done, it had better be got over at once, so as to be off his mind.\r\nMartyn and Frith gathered that the case was thought doubtful, and\r\nentirely dependent on constitution and rallying power.  Clarence himself\r\nseemed almost passive, caring only for our presence and the\r\naccomplishment of his task.\r\n\r\nWe had a blessed thanksgiving for mercies received in the Margaret Street\r\nChapel, as we called what is now All Saints; but he and I were unfit for\r\ncrowds, and on Sunday morning availed ourselves of a friend\xe2\x80\x99s seat in our\r\nold church, which felt so natural and homelike to us elders that Martyn\r\nwas scandalised at our taste.  But it was the church of our Confirmation\r\nand first Communion, and Clarence rejoiced that it was that of his first\r\nhome-coming Eucharist.  What a contrast was he now to the shrinking boy,\r\nscarcely tolerated under his stigmatised name.  Surely the Angel had led\r\nhim all his life through!\r\n\r\nHow happy we two were in the afternoon, while the others conducted\r\nLawrence to some more noteworthy church.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, \xe2\x80\x98let us go down to Beachharbour.  It must be done\r\nat once.  I have been trying to write, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x99 and his face\r\nlighted with a quiet smile which I understood.\r\n\r\nSo we wrote to the principal hotel to secure rooms, and set forth on\r\nTuesday, leaving Frith to finish with Mr. Castleford what could not be\r\nsettled in the one business interview that had been held with Clarence on\r\nthe Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nRESTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Ah! well for us all some sweet hope lies\r\n    Deeply buried from human eyes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                 WHITTIER.\r\n\r\nTHINGS always happen in unexpected ways.  During the little hesitation\r\nand difficulty that always attend my transits at a station, a voice was\r\nheard to say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh!  Papa, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that Edward Winslow?\xe2\x80\x99  Martyn gave a\r\nviolent start, and Mr. Fordyce was exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98Clarence, my dear fellow,\r\nit isn\xe2\x80\x99t you!  I beg your pardon; you have strength enough left nearly to\r\nwring one\xe2\x80\x99s hand off!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x94I wanted very much to see you, sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence.  \xe2\x80\x98Could you be so\r\ngood as to appoint a time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98See you!  We must always be seeing you of course.  Let me think.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot three weddings and a funeral to-morrow, and Simpson coming about the\r\nmeeting.  Come to luncheon\xe2\x80\x94all of you.  Mrs. Fordyce will be delighted,\r\nand so will somebody else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about the somebody else, for Anne\xe2\x80\x99s feet were as\r\nnearly dancing round Emily as public propriety allowed, and the radiance\r\nof her face was something to rejoice in.  Say what people will,\r\nEnglishwomen in a quiet cheerful life are apt to gain rather than lose in\r\nlooks up to the borders of middle age.  Our Emily at two-and-thirty was\r\nfair and pleasant to look on; while as for Anne Fordyce at twenty-three,\r\nwords will hardly tell how lovely were her delicate features, brown eyes,\r\nand carnation cheeks, illuminated by that sunshine brightness of her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s, which made one feel better all day for having been beamed upon\r\nby either of them.  Clarence certainly did, when the good man turned back\r\nto say, \xe2\x80\x98Which hotel?  Eh?  That\xe2\x80\x99s too far off.  You must come nearer.  I\r\nwould see you in, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a woman to see before church time, and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nshort of a curate, so I must be sharp to the hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Can I be of any use?\xe2\x80\x99 eagerly asked Martyn.  \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow you as soon as\r\nI have got these fellows to their quarters.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWe had Amos with us, and were soon able to release Martyn, after a few\r\ncompliments on my not being as usual _the_ invalid; and by and by he came\r\nback to take Emily to inspect a lodging, recommended by our friends,\r\nclose to the beach, and not a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw from the Rectory built by Mr.\r\nFordyce.  As we two useless beings sat opposite to each other, looking\r\nover the roofs of houses at the blue expanse and feeling the salt breeze,\r\nit was no fancy that Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s cheek looked less wan, and his eyes\r\nclearer, as a smile of content played on his lips.  \xe2\x80\x98Years sit well on\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x99 he said gaily; and I thought of rewards in store for him.\r\n\r\nThen he took this opportunity of consulting me on the chances for Frith,\r\ntelling of the original offer, and the quiet constancy of his friend, and\r\nasking whether I thought Emily would relent.  And I answered that I\r\nsuspected that she would,\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98But you must get well first.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I begin to think that more possible,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, and my heart bounded\r\nas he added, \xe2\x80\x98she would be satisfied since you would always have a home\r\nwith _us_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOh, how much was implied in that monosyllable.  He knew it, for a little\r\nfaint colour came up, as he, shyly, laughed and hesitated, \xe2\x80\x98That is\xe2\x80\x94if\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If\xe2\x80\x99 included Mrs. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s not being ungracious.  Nor was she.  Emily\r\nhad found her as kind as in the old days at Hillside, and perfectly ready\r\nto bring us into close vicinity.  It was not caprice that had made this\r\nchange, but all possible doubt and risk of character were over, the old\r\nwound was in some measure healed, and the friendship had been brought\r\nforemost by our recent sorrow and our present anxiety.  Anne was in\r\necstasies over Emily.  \xe2\x80\x98It is so odd,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98to have grown as old as\r\nyou, whom I used to think so very grown up,\xe2\x80\x99 and she had all her pet\r\nplans to display in the future.  Moreover, Martyn had been permitted to\r\nrelieve the Rector from the funeral\xe2\x80\x94a privilege which seemed to gratify\r\nhim as much as if it had been the liveliest of services.\r\n\r\nWe were to lunch at the Rectory, and the move of our goods was to be\r\neffected while we were there.  We found Mrs. Fordyce looking much older,\r\nbut far less of an invalid than in old times, and there was something\r\nmore genial and less exclusive in her ways, owing perhaps to the\r\ndifference of her life among the many classes with whom she was called on\r\nto associate.\r\n\r\nSomersetshire, Beachharbour, and China occupied our tongues by turns, and\r\nwe had to begin luncheon without the Rector, who had been hindered by\r\nnumerous calls; in fact, as Anne warned us, it was a wonder if he got the\r\nlength of the esplanade without being stopped half-a-dozen times.\r\n\r\nHis welcome was like himself, but he needed a reminder of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrequest for an interview.  Then we repaired to the study, for Clarence\r\nbegged that his brothers might be present, and then the beginning was\r\nmade.  \xe2\x80\x98Do you remember my showing you a will that I found in the ruins\r\nat Chantry House?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A horrid old scrap that you chose to call one.  Yes; I told you to burn\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Sir, we have proved that a great injustice was perpetrated by our\r\nancestor, Philip Winslow, and that the poor lady who made that will was\r\ncruelly treated, if not murdered.  This is no fancy; I have known it for\r\nyears past, but it is only now that restitution has become possible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Restitution?  What are you talking about?  I never wanted the place nor\r\ncoveted it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, sir, but the act was our forefather\xe2\x80\x99s.  You cannot bid us sit down\r\nunder the consciousness of profiting by a crime.  I could not do so\r\nbefore, but I now implore you to let me restore you either Chantry House\r\nand the three farms, or their purchase money, according to the valuation\r\nmade at my father\xe2\x80\x99s death.  I have it in hand.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrank Fordyce walked about the room quite overcome.  \xe2\x80\x98You foolish\r\nfellow!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98Was it for this that you have been toiling and\r\nthrowing away your health in that pestiferous place?  Edward, did you\r\nknow this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 I answered.  \xe2\x80\x98Clarence has intended this ever since he found the\r\nwill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98As if that was a will!  You consented.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We all thought it right.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture of dismay at such folly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do not think you understand how it was, Mr. Fordyce,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence,\r\nwho by this time was quivering and trembling as in his boyish days.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, nor ever wish to do so.  Such matters ought to be forgotten, and you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look fit to say another word.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Edward will tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Clarence, leaning back.\r\n\r\nI had the whole written out, and was about to begin, when the person,\r\nwith whom there was an appointment, was reported, and we knew that the\r\nrest of the day was mapped out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mr. Fordyce, \xe2\x80\x98leave that with me; I can\xe2\x80\x99t give any\r\nanswer off-hand, except that Don Quixote is come alive again, only too\r\nlike himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhich was true, for Clarence took long to rally from the effort, and had\r\nto be kept quiet for some time in the study where we were left.  He\r\nexamined me on the contents of my paper, and was vexed to hear that I had\r\nmentioned the ghost, which he said would discredit the whole.  Never was\r\nthe dear fellow so much inclined to be fretful, and when Martyn\r\nrestlessly observed that if we did not want him, he might as well go back\r\nto the drawing-room, the reply was quite sharp\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes, by all means.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNo wonder there was pain in the tone; for the next words, after some\r\ninterval, were, when two happy voices came ringing in from the garden\r\nbehind, \xe2\x80\x98You see, Edward.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomehow I had never thought of Martyn.  He had simply seemed to me a boy,\r\nand I had decided that Anne would be the crown of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s labours.  I\r\nanswered \xe2\x80\x98Nonsense; they are both children together!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The nonsense was elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.  \xe2\x80\x98They always were devoted to each\r\nother.  I saw how it was the moment he came into the room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98it is only the old habit.  When she knows all,\r\nshe must prefer\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hush!\xe2\x80\x99 he said.  \xe2\x80\x98An old scarecrow and that beautiful young creature!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand he laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You won\xe2\x80\x99t be an old scarecrow long.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in an ominous way, and cut short the discussion by going\r\nback to Mrs. Fordyce.\r\n\r\nHe was worn out, had a bad night, and did not get up to breakfast; I was\r\nwaiting for it in the sitting-room, when Mr. Fordyce came in after matins\r\nwith Emily and Martyn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel just like David when they brought him the water of Bethlehem,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsaid.  \xe2\x80\x98You know I think this all nonsense, especially this\xe2\x80\x94this ghost\r\nbusiness; and yet, such\xe2\x80\x94such doings as your brother\xe2\x80\x99s can\xe2\x80\x99t go for\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHis face worked, and the tears were in his eyes; then, as he partook of\r\nour breakfast, he cross-examined us on my statement, and even tried to\r\npersuade us that the phantom in the ruin was Emily; and on her observing\r\nthat she could not have seen herself, he talked of the Brocken Spectre\r\nand fog mirages; but we declared the night was clear, and I told him that\r\nall the rational theories I had ever heard were far more improbable than\r\nthe appearance herself, at which he laughed.  Then he scrupulously\r\ndemanded whether this\xe2\x80\x94this (he failed to find a name for it) would be an\r\nimpoverishment of our family, and I showed how Clarence had provided that\r\nwe should be in as easy circumstances as before.  In the midst came in\r\nClarence himself, having hastened to dress, on hearing that Mr. Fordyce\r\nwas in the house, and looking none the better for the exertion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look here, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x99 said Frank, taking his hot trembling hand, \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nhave put me in a great fix.  You have done the noblest deed at a terrible\r\ncost, and whatever I may think, it ought not to be thrown away, nor you\r\nbe hindered from freeing your soul from this sense of family guilt.  But\r\nhere, my forefathers had as little right to the Chantry as yours, and\r\never since I began to think about such things, I have been thankful it\r\nwas none of mine.  Let us join in giving it or its value to some good\r\nwork for God\xe2\x80\x94pour it out to the Lord, as we may say.  Bless me! what have\r\nI done now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFor Clarence, muttering \xe2\x80\x98thank you,\xe2\x80\x99 sank out of his grasp on a chair,\r\nand as nearly as possible fainted; but he was soon smiling and saying it\r\nwas all relief, and he felt as if a load he had been bearing had been\r\nsuddenly removed.\r\n\r\nFrank Fordyce durst stay no longer, but laid his hand on Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nand blessed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nTHE FORDYCE STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98For soon as once the genial plain\r\n    Has drunk the life-blood of the slain,\r\n    Indelible the spots remain,\r\n    And aye for vengeance call.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                    EURIPIDES\xe2\x80\x94(_Anstice_).\r\n\r\nSTILL all was not over, for by the next day our brother was as ill, or\r\nworse, than ever.  The doctor who came from London allowed that he had\r\nexpected something of the kind, but thought we must have let him exert\r\nhimself perilously.  Poor innocent Martyn and Anne, they little suspected\r\nthat their bright eyes and happy voices had something to do with the\r\nstruggle and disappointment, which probably was one cause of the\r\ncollapse.  As to poor Frank Fordyce, I never saw him so distressed; he\r\nfelt as if it were all his own fault, or that of his ancestors, and,\r\nwhenever he was not required by his duties, was lingering about for news.\r\nI had little hope, though Clarence seemed to me the very light of my\r\neyes; it was to me as though, his task being accomplished, and the\r\nearthly reward denied, he must be on his way to the higher one.\r\n\r\nHis complete quiescence confirmed me in the assurance that he thought so\r\nhimself.  He was too ill for speech, but Lawrence, who could not stay\r\naway, was struck with the difference from former times.  Not only were\r\nthere no delusions, but there was no anxiety or uneasiness, as there had\r\nalways been in the former attacks, when he was evidently eager to live,\r\nand still more solicitous to be told if he were in a hopeless state.  Now\r\nhe had plainly resigned himself\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Content to live, but not afraid to die;\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nand perhaps, dear fellow, it was chiefly for my sake that he was willing\r\nto live.  At least, I know that when the worst was over, he announced it\r\nby putting those wasted fingers into mine, and saying\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, dear old fellow, I believe we shall jog on together, after all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThat attack, though the most severe of all, brought, either owing to\r\nskilful treatment or to his own calm, the removal of the mischief, and\r\nthe beginning of real recovery.  Previously he had given himself no time,\r\nbut had hurried on to exertions which retarded his cure, so as very\r\nnearly to be fatal; but he was now perfectly submissive to whatever\r\nphysicians or nurses desired, and did not seem to find his slow\r\nconvalescence in the least tedious, since he was amongst us all again.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a month before he was disposed to recur to the subject of\r\nhis old solicitude again, and then he asked what Mr. Fordyce had said or\r\ndone.  Just nothing at all; but on the next visit paid to the sick-room,\r\nParson Frank yielded to his earnest request to send for any documents\r\nthat might throw light on the subject, and after a few days he brought us\r\na packet of letters from his deed-box.  They were written from Hillside\r\nRectory to the son in the army in Flanders, chiefly by his mother, and\r\nwere full of hot, angry invective against our family, and pity for poor,\r\nfoolish \xe2\x80\x98Madam,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Cousin Winslow,\xe2\x80\x99 as she was generally termed, for\r\nhaving put herself in their power.\r\n\r\nThe one most to the purpose was an account of the examination of Molly\r\nCox, the waiting-woman, who had been in attendance on the unfortunate\r\nMargaret, and whose story tallied fairly with Aunt Peggy\xe2\x80\x99s tradition.\r\nShe declared that she was sure that her mistress had met with foul play.\r\nShe had left her as usual at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the fatal 27th of December\r\n1707, in the inner one of the old chambers; and in the night had heard\r\nthe tipsy return home of the gentlemen, followed by shrieks.  In the\r\nmorning she (the maid) who usually was the first to go to her room, was\r\nmet by Mistress Betty Winslow, and told that Madam was ill, and\r\ninsensible.  The old nurse of the Winslows was called in; and Molly was\r\nnever left alone in the sick-room, scarcely permitted to approach the\r\nbed, and never to touch her lady.  Once, when emptying out a cup at the\r\ngarden-door, she saw a mark of blood on the steps, but Mr. Philip came up\r\nand swore at her for a prying fool.  Doctor Tomkins was sent for, but he\r\nbarely walked through the room, and \xe2\x80\x98all know that he is a mere creature\r\nof Philip Winslow,\xe2\x80\x99 wrote the Mrs. Fordyce of that date to her son.  And\r\npresently after, \xe2\x80\x98Justice Eastwood declared there is no case for a Grand\r\nJury; but he is a known Friend and sworn Comrade of the Winslows, and\r\nbound to suppress all evidence against them.  Nay, James Dearlove swears\r\nhe saw Edward Winslow slip a golden Guinea into his Clerk\xe2\x80\x99s Hand.  But as\r\nsure as there is a Heaven above us, Francis, poor Cousin Winslow was\r\ntrying to escape to us of her own Kindred, and met with cruel Usage.  Her\r\nBlood is on their Heads.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There!\xe2\x80\x99 said Frank Fordyce.  \xe2\x80\x98This Francis challenged Philip Winslow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neldest son, a mere boy, three days after he joined the army before Lille,\r\nand shot him like a dog.  I turned over the letter about it in searching\r\nfor these.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t boast of my ancestors more than you can.  But may God\r\naccept this work of yours, and take away the guilt of blood from both of\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And have you thought what is best to be done?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Clarence, raising\r\nhimself on his cushions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Have you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the Vicar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh yes; I have had my dreams.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey put their castles together, and they turned out to be for an\r\norphanage, or rather asylum, not too much hampered with strict rules,\r\ncombined with a convalescent home.  The battle of sisterhoods was not yet\r\nfought out, and we were not quite prepared for them; but Frank Fordyce\r\nhad, as he said, \xe2\x80\x98the two best women in the world in his eye\xe2\x80\x99 to make a\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThere was full time to think and discuss the scheme, for our patient was\r\nin no condition to move for many weeks, lying day after day on a couch\r\njust within the window of our sitting-room, which was as nearly as\r\npossible in the sea, so that he constantly had the freshness of its\r\nbreezes, the music of its ripple, and the sight of its waves, and seemed\r\nto find endless pleasure in watching the red sails, the puffs of steam,\r\nand the frolics of the children, simple or gentle, on the beach.\r\n\r\nSomething else was sometimes to be watched.  Martyn, all this time, was\r\ndoing the work of two curates, and was to be seen walking home with Anne\r\nfrom church or school, carrying her baskets and bags, and, as we were\r\ngiven to understand, discussing by turns ecclesiastical questions,\r\nvisionary sisterhoods, and naughty children.  At first I wished it were\r\npossible to remove Clarence from the perpetual spectacle, but we had one\r\nlast talk over the matter, and this was quite satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It does me no harm,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; \xe2\x80\x98I like to see it.  Yes, it is quite true\r\nthat I do.  What was personal and selfish in my fancies seems to have\r\nbeen worn out in the great lull of my senses under the shadow of death;\r\nand now I can revert with real joy and thankfulness to the old delight of\r\nlooking on our dear Ellen as our sister, and watch those two children as\r\nwe used when they talked of dolls\xe2\x80\x99 fenders instead of the surplice war.\r\nI have got you, Edward; and you know there is a love \xe2\x80\x9cpassing the love of\r\nwomen.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA lively young couple passed by the window just then, and with untamed\r\nvoices observed\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There are those two poor miserable objects!  It is enough to make one\r\nmelancholy only to look at them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhereat we simultaneously burst out laughing; perhaps because a choking,\r\nvery far from misery, was in our throats.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Clarence was prepared to be the cordial, fatherly brother,\r\nwhen Martyn came headlong in upon us with the tidings that utterly\r\nindescribable, unimaginable joy had befallen him.  A revelation seemed\r\nsimultaneously to have broken upon him and Anne while they were copying\r\nout the Sunday School Registers, that what they had felt for each other\r\nall their lives was love\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98real, true love,\xe2\x80\x99 as Anne said to Emily, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nnever could have cared for anybody else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMrs. Fordyce\xe2\x80\x99s sharp eyes had seen what was coming, and accepted the\r\ninevitable, quite as soon as Clarence had.  She came and talked it over\r\nwith us, saying she was perfectly satisfied and happy.  Martyn was all\r\nthat could be wished, and she was sincerely glad of the connection with\r\nher old friends.  So, in fact, was dear old Frank, but he had been\r\nrunning about with his head full, and his eyes closed, so that it was\r\nquite a shock to him to find that his little Anne, his boon companion and\r\nplayfellow, was actually grown up, and presuming to love and be loved;\r\nand he could hardly believe that she was really seven years older than\r\nher sister had been when the like had begun with her.  But if Anne must\r\nbe at those tricks, he said, shaking his head at her, he had rather it\r\nwas with Martyn than anybody else.\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty as to money matters.  In truth, Martyn was not so\r\ngood a match as an heiress, such as was Anne Fordyce, might have aspired\r\nto, and her Lester kin were sure to be shocked; but even if Clarence\r\nmarried, the Earlscombe living went for something (though, by the bye, he\r\nhas never held it), and the Fordyces only cared that there should be easy\r\ncircumstances.  The living of Hillside would be resigned in favour of\r\nMartyn in the spring, and meantime he would gain more experience at\r\nBeachharbour, and this would break the separation to the Fordyces.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, theirs was not to be our first wedding.  I have said\r\nlittle of Emily.  The fact was, that after that week of Clarence\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndanger, we said she lived in a kind of dream.  She fulfilled all that was\r\nwanted of her, nursing Clarence, waiting on me, ordering dinner, making\r\nthe tea, and so forth; but it was quite evident that life began for her\r\non the Saturdays, when Lawrence came down, and ended on the Mondays, when\r\nhe went away.  If, in the meantime, she sat down to work, she went off\r\ninto a trance; if she was sent out for fresh air, she walked quarter-deck\r\non the esplanade, neither seeing nor hearing anything, we averred, but\r\nsome imaginary Lawrence Frith.\r\n\r\nIf she had any drawback, good girl, it was the idea of deserting me; but\r\nthen, as I could honestly tell her, nobody need fear for my happiness,\r\nsince Clarence was given back to me.  And she believed, and was ready to\r\ngo to China with her Lawrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nTHE LAST DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x98Grief will be joy if on its edge\r\n    Fall soft that holiest ray,\r\n    Joy will be grief, if no faint pledge\r\n    Be there of heavenly day.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                    KEBLE.\r\n\r\nWE did not move from Beachharbour till September, and by that time it had\r\nbeen decided that Chantry House itself should be given up to the new\r\nscheme.  It was too large for us, and Clarence had never lived there\r\nenough to have any strong home feeling for it; but he rather connected it\r\nwith disquiet and distress, and had a longing to make actual restitution\r\nthereof, instead of only giving an equivalent, as he did in the case of\r\nthe farms.  Our feelings about the desecrated chapel were also\r\nconsiderably changed from the days when we regarded it merely as a\r\npicturesque ruin, and it was to be at once restored both for the benefit\r\nof the orphanage, and for that of the neighbouring households.  For\r\nourselves, a cottage was to be built, suited to our idiosyncrasies; but\r\nthat could wait till after the yacht voyage, which we were to make\r\ntogether for the winter.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that the last time we inhabited Chantry House was\r\nwhen we gave Emily to Lawrence Frith.  We would fain have made it a\r\ndouble wedding, but the Fordyces wished to wait for Easter, when Martyn\r\nwould have been inducted to Hillside.  They came, however, that Mrs.\r\nFordyce might act lady of the house, and Anne be bridesmaid, as well as\r\nlay the first stone of St. Cecily\xe2\x80\x99s restored chapel.\r\n\r\nIt was on the day on which they were expected, when the workmen were\r\ndigging foundations, and clearing away rubbish, that the foreman begged\r\nMr. Winslow to come out to see something they had found.  Clarence came\r\nback, very grave and awe-struck.  It was an old oak chest, and within lay\r\na skeleton, together with a few fragments of female clothing, a wedding\r\nring, and some coins of the later Stewarts, in a rotten leathern purse.\r\nThis was ghastly confirmation, though there was nothing else to connect\r\nthe bones with poor Margaret.  We had some curiosity as to the coffin in\r\nthe niche in the family vault which bore her name, but both Clarence and\r\nMr. Fordyce shrank from investigations which could not be carried out\r\nwithout publicity, and might perhaps have disturbed other remains.\r\n\r\nSo on the ensuing night there was a strange, quiet funeral service at\r\nEarlscombe Church.  Mr. Henderson officiated, and Chapman acted as clerk.\r\nThese, with Amos Bell, alone knew the tradition, or understood what the\r\ndiscovery meant to the two Fordyces and three Winslows who stood at the\r\nopening of the vault, and prayed that whatever guilt there might be\r\nshould be put away from the families so soon to be made one.  The coins\r\nwere placed with those of Victoria, which the next day Anne laid beneath\r\nthe foundation-stone of St. Cecily\xe2\x80\x99s.  I need not say that no one has\r\never again heard the wailings, nor seen the lady with the lamp.\r\n\r\nWhat more is there to tell?  It was of this first half of our lives that\r\nI intended to write, and though many years have since passed, they have\r\nnot had the same character of romance and would not interest you.  Our\r\nhoneymoon, as Mr. Fordyce called the expedition we two brothers made in\r\nthe Mediterranean, was a perfect success; and Clarence regained health,\r\nand better spirits than had ever been his; while contriving to show me\r\nall that I was capable of being carried to see.  It was complete\r\nenjoyment, and he came home, not as strong as in old times, but with fair\r\ncomfort and capability for the work of life, so as to be able to take Mr.\r\nCastleford\xe2\x80\x99s place, when our dear old friend retired from active\r\ndirection of the firm.\r\n\r\nYou all know how the two old bachelors have kept house together in London\r\nand at Earlscombe cottage, and you are all proud of the honoured name\r\nClarence Winslow has made for himself, foremost in works for the glory of\r\nGod and the good of men\xe2\x80\x94as one of those merchant princes of England whose\r\nmerchandise has indeed been Holiness unto the Lord.\r\n\r\nThus you must all have felt a shock on finding that he always looked on\r\nthat name as blotted, and that one of the last sayings I heard from him\r\nwas, \xe2\x80\x98O remember not the sins and offences of my youth, but according to\r\nThy mercy, think upon me, O Lord, for Thy goodness.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he almost smiled, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, He has so looked on me, and I am\r\nthankful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThankful, and so am I, for those thirty-four peaceful years we spent\r\ntogether, or rather for the seventy years of perfect brotherhood that we\r\nhave been granted, and though he has left me behind him, I am content to\r\nwait.  It cannot be for long.  My brothers and sisters, their children,\r\nand my faithful Amos Bell, are very good to me; and in writing up to that\r\n_mezzo termine_ of our lives, I have been living it over again with my\r\nbrother of brothers, through the troubles that have become like joys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUncle Edward has not said half enough about his dear old self.  I want to\r\nknow if he never was unhappy when he was young about being _like that_,\r\nthough mother says his face was always nearly as beautiful as it is now.\r\nAnd it is not only goodness.  It _is_ beautiful with his sweet smile and\r\nsnowy white hair.\r\n\r\n                                                            ELLEN WINSLOW.\r\n\r\nAnd I wonder, though perhaps he could not have told, what Aunt Anne would\r\nhave done if Uncle Clarence had not been so forbearing before he went to\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n                                                              CLARE FRITH.\r\n\r\nThe others are highly impertinent questions, but we ought to know what\r\nbecame of Lady Peacock.\r\n\r\n                                                                 ED. G. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor woman, she drifted back to London after about ten years, with an\r\nincurable disease.  Clarence put her into lodgings near us, and did his\r\nbest for her as long as she lived.  He had a hard task, but she ended by\r\nsaying he was her only friend.\r\n\r\nTo question No. 2 I have nothing to say; but as to No. 1, with its\r\nextravagant compliment, Nature, or rather God, blessed me with even\r\nspirits, a methodical nature that prefers monotony, and very little\r\nmorbid shyness; nor have I ever been devoid of tender care and love.  So\r\nthat I can only remember three severe fits of depression.  One, when I\r\nhad just begun to be taken out in the Square Gardens, and Selina Clarkson\r\nwas heard to say I was a hideous little monster.  It was a revelation,\r\nand must have given frightful pain, for I remember it acutely after\r\nsixty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe second fit was just after Clarence was gone to sea, and some very\r\npainful experiments had been tried in vain for making me like other\r\npeople.  For the first time I faced the fact that I was set aside from\r\nall possible careers, and should be, as I remember saying, \xe2\x80\x98no better\r\nthan a girl.\xe2\x80\x99  I must have been a great trial to all my friends.  My\r\nfather tried to reason on resignation, and tell me happiness could be\r\n_in_ myself, till he broke down.  My mother attempted bracing by reproof.\r\nMiss Newton endeavoured to make me see that this was my cross.  Every\r\nword was true, and came round again, but they only made me for the time\r\nmore rebellious and wretched.  That attack was ended, of all things in\r\nthe world, by heraldry.  My attention somehow was drawn that way, and the\r\nstudy filled up time and thought till my misfortunes passed into custom,\r\nand haunted me no more.\r\n\r\nMy last was a more serious access, after coming into the country, when\r\nimproved health and vigour inspired cravings that made me fully sensible\r\nof my blighted existence.  I had gone the length of my tether and\r\noverdone myself; I missed London life and Clarence; and the more I blamed\r\nmyself, and tried to rouse myself, the more despondent and discontented I\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\nThis time my physician was Mr. Stafford; I had deciphered a bit of old\r\nFrench and Latin for him, and he was very much pleased.  \xe2\x80\x98Why, Edward,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said, \xe2\x80\x98you are a very clever fellow; you can be a distinguished\xe2\x80\x94or\r\nwhat is better\xe2\x80\x94a useful man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSomehow that saying restored the spring of hope, and gave an impulse!  I\r\nhave not been a distinguished man, but I think in my degree I have been a\r\nfairly useful one, and I am sure I have been a happy one.\r\n\r\n                                                                     E. W.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Useful! that you have, dear old fellow.  Even if you had done nothing\r\nelse, and never been an unconscious backbone to Clarence; your influence\r\non me and mine has been unspeakably blest.  But pray, Mistress Anne, how\r\nabout that question of naughty little Clare\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n                                                                     M. W.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you had better let alone that question, reverend sir?\r\nYoungest pets are apt to be saucy, especially in these days, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexpect it of you!  It might have been the worse for you if W. C. W. had\r\nnot held his tongue in those days.  Just like himself, but I am heartily\r\nglad that so he did.\r\n\r\n                                                                    A.

It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org \r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n'
