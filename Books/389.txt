I was not sure you could\r\nspare the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was able to make arrangements for a few days; things are not very\r\nlively just now. But have you no misgivings, Raymond? Is it absolutely\r\nsafe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men were slowly pacing the terrace in front of Dr. Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. The sun still hung above the western mountain-line, but it shone\r\nwith a dull red glow that cast no shadows, and all the air was quiet; a\r\nsweet breath came from the great wood on the hillside above, and with\r\nit, at intervals, the soft murmuring call of the wild doves. Below, in\r\nthe long lovely valley, the river wound in and out between the lonely\r\nhills, and, as the sun hovered and vanished into the west, a faint\r\nmist, pure white, began to rise from the hills. Dr. Raymond turned\r\nsharply to his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSafe? Of course it is. In itself the operation is a perfectly simple\r\none; any surgeon could do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there is no danger at any other stage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone; absolutely no physical danger whatsoever, I give you my word.\r\nYou are always timid, Clarke, always; but you know my history. I have\r\ndevoted myself to transcendental medicine for the last twenty years. I\r\nhave heard myself called quack and charlatan and impostor, but all the\r\nwhile I knew I was on the right path. Five years ago I reached the\r\ngoal, and since then every day has been a preparation for what we shall\r\ndo tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to believe it is all true.\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke knit his brows, and\r\nlooked doubtfully at Dr. Raymond. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you perfectly sure, Raymond,\r\nthat your theory is not a phantasmagoria\xe2\x80\x94a splendid vision, certainly,\r\nbut a mere vision after all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Raymond stopped in his walk and turned sharply. He was a\r\nmiddle-aged man, gaunt and thin, of a pale yellow complexion, but as he\r\nanswered Clarke and faced him, there was a flush on his cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook about you, Clarke. You see the mountain, and hill following after\r\nhill, as wave on wave, you see the woods and orchard, the fields of\r\nripe corn, and the meadows reaching to the reed-beds by the river. You\r\nsee me standing here beside you, and hear my voice; but I tell you that\r\nall these things\xe2\x80\x94yes, from that star that has just shone out in the sky\r\nto the solid ground beneath our feet\xe2\x80\x94I say that all these are but\r\ndreams and shadows; the shadows that hide the real world from our eyes.\r\nThere _is_ a real world, but it is beyond this glamour and this vision,\r\nbeyond these \xe2\x80\x98chases in Arras, dreams in a career,\xe2\x80\x99 beyond them all as\r\nbeyond a veil. I do not know whether any human being has ever lifted\r\nthat veil; but I do know, Clarke, that you and I shall see it lifted\r\nthis very night from before another\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. You may think this all\r\nstrange nonsense; it may be strange, but it is true, and the ancients\r\nknew what lifting the veil means. They called it seeing the god Pan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarke shivered; the white mist gathering over the river was chilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is wonderful indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are standing on the brink of a\r\nstrange world, Raymond, if what you say is true. I suppose the knife is\r\nabsolutely necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; a slight lesion in the grey matter, that is all; a trifling\r\nrearrangement of certain cells, a microscopical alteration that would\r\nescape the attention of ninety-nine brain specialists out of a hundred.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother you with \xe2\x80\x98shop,\xe2\x80\x99 Clarke; I might give you a mass\r\nof technical detail which would sound very imposing, and would leave\r\nyou as enlightened as you are now. But I suppose you have read,\r\ncasually, in out-of-the-way corners of your paper, that immense strides\r\nhave been made recently in the physiology of the brain. I saw a\r\nparagraph the other day about Digby\xe2\x80\x99s theory, and Browne Faber\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscoveries. Theories and discoveries! Where they are standing now, I\r\nstood fifteen years ago, and I need not tell you that I have not been\r\nstanding still for the last fifteen years. It will be enough if I say\r\nthat five years ago I made the discovery that I alluded to when I said\r\nthat ten years ago I reached the goal. After years of labour, after\r\nyears of toiling and groping in the dark, after days and nights of\r\ndisappointments and sometimes of despair, in which I used now and then\r\nto tremble and grow cold with the thought that perhaps there were\r\nothers seeking for what I sought, at last, after so long, a pang of\r\nsudden joy thrilled my soul, and I knew the long journey was at an end.\r\nBy what seemed then and still seems a chance, the suggestion of a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s idle thought followed up upon familiar lines and paths that I\r\nhad tracked a hundred times already, the great truth burst upon me, and\r\nI saw, mapped out in lines of sight, a whole world, a sphere unknown;\r\ncontinents and islands, and great oceans in which no ship has sailed\r\n(to my belief) since a Man first lifted up his eyes and beheld the sun,\r\nand the stars of heaven, and the quiet earth beneath. You will think\r\nthis all high-flown language, Clarke, but it is hard to be literal. And\r\nyet; I do not know whether what I am hinting at cannot be set forth in\r\nplain and lonely terms. For instance, this world of ours is pretty well\r\ngirded now with the telegraph wires and cables; thought, with something\r\nless than the speed of thought, flashes from sunrise to sunset, from\r\nnorth to south, across the floods and the desert places. Suppose that\r\nan electrician of today were suddenly to perceive that he and his\r\nfriends have merely been playing with pebbles and mistaking them for\r\nthe foundations of the world; suppose that such a man saw uttermost\r\nspace lie open before the current, and words of men flash forth to the\r\nsun and beyond the sun into the systems beyond, and the voice of\r\narticulate-speaking men echo in the waste void that bounds our thought.\r\nAs analogies go, that is a pretty good analogy of what I have done; you\r\ncan understand now a little of what I felt as I stood here one evening;\r\nit was a summer evening, and the valley looked much as it does now; I\r\nstood here, and saw before me the unutterable, the unthinkable gulf\r\nthat yawns profound between two worlds, the world of matter and the\r\nworld of spirit; I saw the great empty deep stretch dim before me, and\r\nin that instant a bridge of light leapt from the earth to the unknown\r\nshore, and the abyss was spanned. You may look in Browne Faber\xe2\x80\x99s book,\r\nif you like, and you will find that to the present day men of science\r\nare unable to account for the presence, or to specify the functions of\r\na certain group of nerve-cells in the brain. That group is, as it were,\r\nland to let, a mere waste place for fanciful theories. I am not in the\r\nposition of Browne Faber and the specialists, I am perfectly instructed\r\nas to the possible functions of those nerve-centers in the scheme of\r\nthings. With a touch I can bring them into play, with a touch, I say, I\r\ncan set free the current, with a touch I can complete the communication\r\nbetween this world of sense and\xe2\x80\x94we shall be able to finish the sentence\r\nlater on. Yes, the knife is necessary; but think what that knife will\r\neffect. It will level utterly the solid wall of sense, and probably,\r\nfor the first time since man was made, a spirit will gaze on a\r\nspirit-world. Clarke, Mary will see the god Pan!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you remember what you wrote to me? I thought it would be requisite\r\nthat she\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe whispered the rest into the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, not at all. That is nonsense. I assure you. Indeed, it is\r\nbetter as it is; I am quite certain of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConsider the matter well, Raymond. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great responsibility.\r\nSomething might go wrong; you would be a miserable man for the rest of\r\nyour days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think not, even if the worst happened. As you know, I rescued\r\nMary from the gutter, and from almost certain starvation, when she was\r\na child; I think her life is mine, to use as I see fit. Come, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngetting late; we had better go in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDr. Raymond led the way into the house, through the hall, and down a\r\nlong dark passage. He took a key from his pocket and opened a heavy\r\ndoor, and motioned Clarke into his laboratory. It had once been a\r\nbilliard-room, and was lighted by a glass dome in the centre of the\r\nceiling, whence there still shone a sad grey light on the figure of the\r\ndoctor as he lit a lamp with a heavy shade and placed it on a table in\r\nthe middle of the room.\r\n\r\nClarke looked about him. Scarcely a foot of wall remained bare; there\r\nwere shelves all around laden with bottles and phials of all shapes and\r\ncolours, and at one end stood a little Chippendale book-case. Raymond\r\npointed to this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see that parchment Oswald Crollius? He was one of the first to\r\nshow me the way, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he ever found it himself. That is\r\na strange saying of his: \xe2\x80\x98In every grain of wheat there lies hidden the\r\nsoul of a star.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was not much furniture in the laboratory. The table in the\r\ncentre, a stone slab with a drain in one corner, the two armchairs on\r\nwhich Raymond and Clarke were sitting; that was all, except an\r\nodd-looking chair at the furthest end of the room. Clarke looked at it,\r\nand raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is the chair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may as well place it in\r\nposition.\xe2\x80\x9d He got up and wheeled the chair to the light, and began\r\nraising and lowering it, letting down the seat, setting the back at\r\nvarious angles, and adjusting the foot-rest. It looked comfortable\r\nenough, and Clarke passed his hand over the soft green velvet, as the\r\ndoctor manipulated the levers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Clarke, make yourself quite comfortable. I have a couple hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nwork before me; I was obliged to leave certain matters to the last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nRaymond went to the stone slab, and Clarke watched him drearily as he\r\nbent over a row of phials and lit the flame under the crucible. The\r\ndoctor had a small hand-lamp, shaded as the larger one, on a ledge\r\nabove his apparatus, and Clarke, who sat in the shadows, looked down at\r\nthe great shadowy room, wondering at the bizarre effects of brilliant\r\nlight and undefined darkness contrasting with one another. Soon he\r\nbecame conscious of an odd odour, at first the merest suggestion of\r\nodour, in the room, and as it grew more decided he felt surprised that\r\nhe was not reminded of the chemist\xe2\x80\x99s shop or the surgery. Clarke found\r\nhimself idly endeavouring to analyse the sensation, and half conscious,\r\nhe began to think of a day, fifteen years ago, that he had spent\r\nroaming through the woods and meadows near his own home. It was a\r\nburning day at the beginning of August, the heat had dimmed the\r\noutlines of all things and all distances with a faint mist, and people\r\nwho observed the thermometer spoke of an abnormal register, of a\r\ntemperature that was almost tropical. Strangely that wonderful hot day\r\nof the fifties rose up again in Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s imagination; the sense of\r\ndazzling all-pervading sunlight seemed to blot out the shadows and the\r\nlights of the laboratory, and he felt again the heated air beating in\r\ngusts about his face, saw the shimmer rising from the turf, and heard\r\nthe myriad murmur of the summer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope the smell doesn\xe2\x80\x99t annoy you, Clarke; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing\r\nunwholesome about it. It may make you a bit sleepy, that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarke heard the words quite distinctly, and knew that Raymond was\r\nspeaking to him, but for the life of him he could not rouse himself\r\nfrom his lethargy. He could only think of the lonely walk he had taken\r\nfifteen years ago; it was his last look at the fields and woods he had\r\nknown since he was a child, and now it all stood out in brilliant\r\nlight, as a picture, before him. Above all there came to his nostrils\r\nthe scent of summer, the smell of flowers mingled, and the odour of the\r\nwoods, of cool shaded places, deep in the green depths, drawn forth by\r\nthe sun\xe2\x80\x99s heat; and the scent of the good earth, lying as it were with\r\narms stretched forth, and smiling lips, overpowered all. His fancies\r\nmade him wander, as he had wandered long ago, from the fields into the\r\nwood, tracking a little path between the shining undergrowth of\r\nbeech-trees; and the trickle of water dropping from the limestone rock\r\nsounded as a clear melody in the dream. Thoughts began to go astray and\r\nto mingle with other thoughts; the beech alley was transformed to a\r\npath between ilex-trees, and here and there a vine climbed from bough\r\nto bough, and sent up waving tendrils and drooped with purple grapes,\r\nand the sparse grey-green leaves of a wild olive-tree stood out against\r\nthe dark shadows of the ilex. Clarke, in the deep folds of dream, was\r\nconscious that the path from his father\xe2\x80\x99s house had led him into an\r\nundiscovered country, and he was wondering at the strangeness of it\r\nall, when suddenly, in place of the hum and murmur of the summer, an\r\ninfinite silence seemed to fall on all things, and the wood was hushed,\r\nand for a moment in time he stood face to face there with a presence,\r\nthat was neither man nor beast, neither the living nor the dead, but\r\nall things mingled, the form of all things but devoid of all form. And\r\nin that moment, the sacrament of body and soul was dissolved, and a\r\nvoice seemed to cry \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go hence,\xe2\x80\x9d and then the darkness of\r\ndarkness beyond the stars, the darkness of everlasting.\r\n\r\nWhen Clarke woke up with a start he saw Raymond pouring a few drops of\r\nsome oily fluid into a green phial, which he stoppered tightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been dozing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cthe journey must have tired you out.\r\nIt is done now. I am going to fetch Mary; I shall be back in ten\r\nminutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarke lay back in his chair and wondered. It seemed as if he had but\r\npassed from one dream into another. He half expected to see the walls\r\nof the laboratory melt and disappear, and to awake in London,\r\nshuddering at his own sleeping fancies. But at last the door opened,\r\nand the doctor returned, and behind him came a girl of about seventeen,\r\ndressed all in white. She was so beautiful that Clarke did not wonder\r\nat what the doctor had written to him. She was blushing now over face\r\nand neck and arms, but Raymond seemed unmoved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMary,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe time has come. You are quite free. Are you\r\nwilling to trust yourself to me entirely?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that, Clarke? You are my witness. Here is the chair, Mary.\r\nIt is quite easy. Just sit in it and lean back. Are you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear, quite ready. Give me a kiss before you begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe doctor stooped and kissed her mouth, kindly enough. \xe2\x80\x9cNow shut your\r\neyes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The girl closed her eyelids, as if she were tired, and\r\nlonged for sleep, and Raymond placed the green phial to her nostrils.\r\nHer face grew white, whiter than her dress; she struggled faintly, and\r\nthen with the feeling of submission strong within her, crossed her arms\r\nupon her breast as a little child about to say her prayers. The bright\r\nlight of the lamp fell full upon her, and Clarke watched changes\r\nfleeting over her face as the changes of the hills when the summer\r\nclouds float across the sun. And then she lay all white and still, and\r\nthe doctor turned up one of her eyelids. She was quite unconscious.\r\nRaymond pressed hard on one of the levers and the chair instantly sank\r\nback. Clarke saw him cutting away a circle, like a tonsure, from her\r\nhair, and the lamp was moved nearer. Raymond took a small glittering\r\ninstrument from a little case, and Clarke turned away shudderingly.\r\nWhen he looked again the doctor was binding up the wound he had made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe will awake in five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d Raymond was still perfectly cool.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing more to be done; we can only wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed slowly; they could hear a slow, heavy, ticking.\r\nThere was an old clock in the passage. Clarke felt sick and faint; his\r\nknees shook beneath him, he could hardly stand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as they watched, they heard a long-drawn sigh, and suddenly\r\ndid the colour that had vanished return to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks, and\r\nsuddenly her eyes opened. Clarke quailed before them. They shone with\r\nan awful light, looking far away, and a great wonder fell upon her\r\nface, and her hands stretched out as if to touch what was invisible;\r\nbut in an instant the wonder faded, and gave place to the most awful\r\nterror. The muscles of her face were hideously convulsed, she shook\r\nfrom head to foot; the soul seemed struggling and shuddering within the\r\nhouse of flesh. It was a horrible sight, and Clarke rushed forward, as\r\nshe fell shrieking to the floor.\r\n\r\nThree days later Raymond took Clarke to Mary\xe2\x80\x99s bedside. She was lying\r\nwide-awake, rolling her head from side to side, and grinning vacantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the doctor, still quite cool, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a great pity; she is a\r\nhopeless idiot. However, it could not be helped; and, after all, she\r\nhas seen the Great God Pan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nMR. CLARKE\xe2\x80\x99S MEMOIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke, the gentleman chosen by Dr. Raymond to witness the strange\r\nexperiment of the god Pan, was a person in whose character caution and\r\ncuriosity were oddly mingled; in his sober moments he thought of the\r\nunusual and eccentric with undisguised aversion, and yet, deep in his\r\nheart, there was a wide-eyed inquisitiveness with respect to all the\r\nmore recondite and esoteric elements in the nature of men. The latter\r\ntendency had prevailed when he accepted Raymond\xe2\x80\x99s invitation, for\r\nthough his considered judgment had always repudiated the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntheories as the wildest nonsense, yet he secretly hugged a belief in\r\nfantasy, and would have rejoiced to see that belief confirmed. The\r\nhorrors that he witnessed in the dreary laboratory were to a certain\r\nextent salutary; he was conscious of being involved in an affair not\r\naltogether reputable, and for many years afterwards he clung bravely to\r\nthe commonplace, and rejected all occasions of occult investigation.\r\nIndeed, on some homeopathic principle, he for some time attended the\r\nseances of distinguished mediums, hoping that the clumsy tricks of\r\nthese gentlemen would make him altogether disgusted with mysticism of\r\nevery kind, but the remedy, though caustic, was not efficacious. Clarke\r\nknew that he still pined for the unseen, and little by little, the old\r\npassion began to reassert itself, as the face of Mary, shuddering and\r\nconvulsed with an unknown terror, faded slowly from his memory.\r\nOccupied all day in pursuits both serious and lucrative, the temptation\r\nto relax in the evening was too great, especially in the winter months,\r\nwhen the fire cast a warm glow over his snug bachelor apartment, and a\r\nbottle of some choice claret stood ready by his elbow. His dinner\r\ndigested, he would make a brief pretence of reading the evening paper,\r\nbut the mere catalogue of news soon palled upon him, and Clarke would\r\nfind himself casting glances of warm desire in the direction of an old\r\nJapanese bureau, which stood at a pleasant distance from the hearth.\r\nLike a boy before a jam-closet, for a few minutes he would hover\r\nindecisive, but lust always prevailed, and Clarke ended by drawing up\r\nhis chair, lighting a candle, and sitting down before the bureau. Its\r\npigeon-holes and drawers teemed with documents on the most morbid\r\nsubjects, and in the well reposed a large manuscript volume, in which\r\nhe had painfully entered the gems of his collection. Clarke had a fine\r\ncontempt for published literature; the most ghostly story ceased to\r\ninterest him if it happened to be printed; his sole pleasure was in the\r\nreading, compiling, and rearranging what he called his \xe2\x80\x9cMemoirs to\r\nprove the Existence of the Devil,\xe2\x80\x9d and engaged in this pursuit the\r\nevening seemed to fly and the night appeared too short.\r\n\r\nOn one particular evening, an ugly December night, black with fog, and\r\nraw with frost, Clarke hurried over his dinner, and scarcely deigned to\r\nobserve his customary ritual of taking up the paper and laying it down\r\nagain. He paced two or three times up and down the room, and opened the\r\nbureau, stood still a moment, and sat down. He leant back, absorbed in\r\none of those dreams to which he was subject, and at length drew out his\r\nbook, and opened it at the last entry. There were three or four pages\r\ndensely covered with Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s round, set penmanship, and at the\r\nbeginning he had written in a somewhat larger hand:\r\n\r\nSingular Narrative told me by my Friend, Dr. Phillips. He assures me\r\nthat all the facts related therein are strictly and wholly True, but\r\nrefuses to give either the Surnames of the Persons Concerned, or the\r\nPlace where these Extraordinary Events occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke began to read over the account for the tenth time, glancing\r\nnow and then at the pencil notes he had made when it was told him by\r\nhis friend. It was one of his humours to pride himself on a certain\r\nliterary ability; he thought well of his style, and took pains in\r\narranging the circumstances in dramatic order. He read the following\r\nstory:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nThe persons concerned in this statement are Helen V., who, if she is\r\nstill alive, must now be a woman of twenty-three, Rachel M., since\r\ndeceased, who was a year younger than the above, and Trevor W., an\r\nimbecile, aged eighteen. These persons were at the period of the story\r\ninhabitants of a village on the borders of Wales, a place of some\r\nimportance in the time of the Roman occupation, but now a scattered\r\nhamlet, of not more than five hundred souls. It is situated on rising\r\nground, about six miles from the sea, and is sheltered by a large and\r\npicturesque forest.\r\n\r\nSome eleven years ago, Helen V. came to the village under rather\r\npeculiar circumstances. It is understood that she, being an orphan, was\r\nadopted in her infancy by a distant relative, who brought her up in his\r\nown house until she was twelve years old. Thinking, however, that it\r\nwould be better for the child to have playmates of her own age, he\r\nadvertised in several local papers for a good home in a comfortable\r\nfarmhouse for a girl of twelve, and this advertisement was answered by\r\nMr. R., a well-to-do farmer in the above-mentioned village. His\r\nreferences proving satisfactory, the gentleman sent his adopted\r\ndaughter to Mr. R., with a letter, in which he stipulated that the girl\r\nshould have a room to herself, and stated that her guardians need be at\r\nno trouble in the matter of education, as she was already sufficiently\r\neducated for the position in life which she would occupy. In fact, Mr.\r\nR. was given to understand that the girl be allowed to find her own\r\noccupations and to spend her time almost as she liked. Mr. R. duly met\r\nher at the nearest station, a town seven miles away from his house, and\r\nseems to have remarked nothing extraordinary about the child except\r\nthat she was reticent as to her former life and her adopted father. She\r\nwas, however, of a very different type from the inhabitants of the\r\nvillage; her skin was a pale, clear olive, and her features were\r\nstrongly marked, and of a somewhat foreign character. She appears to\r\nhave settled down easily enough into farmhouse life, and became a\r\nfavourite with the children, who sometimes went with her on her rambles\r\nin the forest, for this was her amusement. Mr. R. states that he has\r\nknown her to go out by herself directly after their early breakfast,\r\nand not return till after dusk, and that, feeling uneasy at a young\r\ngirl being out alone for so many hours, he communicated with her\r\nadopted father, who replied in a brief note that Helen must do as she\r\nchose. In the winter, when the forest paths are impassable, she spent\r\nmost of her time in her bedroom, where she slept alone, according to\r\nthe instructions of her relative. It was on one of these expeditions to\r\nthe forest that the first of the singular incidents with which this\r\ngirl is connected occurred, the date being about a year after her\r\narrival at the village. The preceding winter had been remarkably\r\nsevere, the snow drifting to a great depth, and the frost continuing\r\nfor an unexampled period, and the summer following was as noteworthy\r\nfor its extreme heat. On one of the very hottest days in this summer,\r\nHelen V. left the farmhouse for one of her long rambles in the forest,\r\ntaking with her, as usual, some bread and meat for lunch. She was seen\r\nby some men in the fields making for the old Roman Road, a green\r\ncauseway which traverses the highest part of the wood, and they were\r\nastonished to observe that the girl had taken off her hat, though the\r\nheat of the sun was already tropical. As it happened, a labourer,\r\nJoseph W. by name, was working in the forest near the Roman Road, and\r\nat twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock his little son, Trevor, brought the man his dinner of\r\nbread and cheese. After the meal, the boy, who was about seven years\r\nold at the time, left his father at work, and, as he said, went to look\r\nfor flowers in the wood, and the man, who could hear him shouting with\r\ndelight at his discoveries, felt no uneasiness. Suddenly, however, he\r\nwas horrified at hearing the most dreadful screams, evidently the\r\nresult of great terror, proceeding from the direction in which his son\r\nhad gone, and he hastily threw down his tools and ran to see what had\r\nhappened. Tracing his path by the sound, he met the little boy, who was\r\nrunning headlong, and was evidently terribly frightened, and on\r\nquestioning him the man elicited that after picking a posy of flowers\r\nhe felt tired, and lay down on the grass and fell asleep. He was\r\nsuddenly awakened, as he stated, by a peculiar noise, a sort of singing\r\nhe called it, and on peeping through the branches he saw Helen V.\r\nplaying on the grass with a \xe2\x80\x9cstrange naked man,\xe2\x80\x9d who he seemed unable\r\nto describe more fully. He said he felt dreadfully frightened and ran\r\naway crying for his father. Joseph W. proceeded in the direction\r\nindicated by his son, and found Helen V. sitting on the grass in the\r\nmiddle of a glade or open space left by charcoal burners. He angrily\r\ncharged her with frightening his little boy, but she entirely denied\r\nthe accusation and laughed at the child\xe2\x80\x99s story of a \xe2\x80\x9cstrange man,\xe2\x80\x9d to\r\nwhich he himself did not attach much credence. Joseph W. came to the\r\nconclusion that the boy had woke up with a sudden fright, as children\r\nsometimes do, but Trevor persisted in his story, and continued in such\r\nevident distress that at last his father took him home, hoping that his\r\nmother would be able to soothe him. For many weeks, however, the boy\r\ngave his parents much anxiety; he became nervous and strange in his\r\nmanner, refusing to leave the cottage by himself, and constantly\r\nalarming the household by waking in the night with cries of \xe2\x80\x9cThe man in\r\nthe wood! father! father!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn course of time, however, the impression seemed to have worn off, and\r\nabout three months later he accompanied his father to the home of a\r\ngentleman in the neighborhood, for whom Joseph W. occasionally did\r\nwork. The man was shown into the study, and the little boy was left\r\nsitting in the hall, and a few minutes later, while the gentleman was\r\ngiving W. his instructions, they were both horrified by a piercing\r\nshriek and the sound of a fall, and rushing out they found the child\r\nlying senseless on the floor, his face contorted with terror. The\r\ndoctor was immediately summoned, and after some examination he\r\npronounced the child to be suffering form a kind of fit, apparently\r\nproduced by a sudden shock. The boy was taken to one of the bedrooms,\r\nand after some time recovered consciousness, but only to pass into a\r\ncondition described by the medical man as one of violent hysteria. The\r\ndoctor exhibited a strong sedative, and in the course of two hours\r\npronounced him fit to walk home, but in passing through the hall the\r\nparoxysms of fright returned and with additional violence. The father\r\nperceived that the child was pointing at some object, and heard the old\r\ncry, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man in the wood,\xe2\x80\x9d and looking in the direction indicated saw\r\na stone head of grotesque appearance, which had been built into the\r\nwall above one of the doors. It seems the owner of the house had\r\nrecently made alterations in his premises, and on digging the\r\nfoundations for some offices, the men had found a curious head,\r\nevidently of the Roman period, which had been placed in the manner\r\ndescribed. The head is pronounced by the most experienced\r\narchaeologists of the district to be that of a faun or satyr.[*]\r\n\r\n[* Dr. Phillips tells me that he has seen the head in question, and\r\nassures me that he has never received such a vivid presentment of\r\nintense evil.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whatever cause arising, this second shock seemed too severe for\r\nthe boy Trevor, and at the present date he suffers from a weakness of\r\nintellect, which gives but little promise of amending. The matter\r\ncaused a good deal of sensation at the time, and the girl Helen was\r\nclosely questioned by Mr. R., but to no purpose, she steadfastly\r\ndenying that she had frightened or in any way molested Trevor.\r\n\r\nThe second event with which this girl\xe2\x80\x99s name is connected took place\r\nabout six years ago, and is of a still more extraordinary character.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the summer of 1882, Helen contracted a friendship\r\nof a peculiarly intimate character with Rachel M., the daughter of a\r\nprosperous farmer in the neighbourhood. This girl, who was a year\r\nyounger than Helen, was considered by most people to be the prettier of\r\nthe two, though Helen\xe2\x80\x99s features had to a great extent softened as she\r\nbecame older. The two girls, who were together on every available\r\nopportunity, presented a singular contrast, the one with her clear,\r\nolive skin and almost Italian appearance, and the other of the\r\nproverbial red and white of our rural districts. It must be stated that\r\nthe payments made to Mr. R. for the maintenance of Helen were known in\r\nthe village for their excessive liberality, and the impression was\r\ngeneral that she would one day inherit a large sum of money from her\r\nrelative. The parents of Rachel were therefore not averse from their\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s friendship with the girl, and even encouraged the intimacy,\r\nthough they now bitterly regret having done so. Helen still retained\r\nher extraordinary fondness for the forest, and on several occasions\r\nRachel accompanied her, the two friends setting out early in the\r\nmorning, and remaining in the wood until dusk. Once or twice after\r\nthese excursions Mrs. M. thought her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s manner rather peculiar;\r\nshe seemed languid and dreamy, and as it has been expressed, \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\r\nfrom herself,\xe2\x80\x9d but these peculiarities seem to have been thought too\r\ntrifling for remark. One evening, however, after Rachel had come home,\r\nher mother heard a noise which sounded like suppressed weeping in the\r\ngirl\xe2\x80\x99s room, and on going in found her lying, half undressed, upon the\r\nbed, evidently in the greatest distress. As soon as she saw her mother,\r\nshe exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, mother, mother, why did you let me go to the forest\r\nwith Helen?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. M. was astonished at so strange a question, and\r\nproceeded to make inquiries. Rachel told her a wild story. She said\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\nClarke closed the book with a snap, and turned his chair towards the\r\nfire. When his friend sat one evening in that very chair, and told his\r\nstory, Clarke had interrupted him at a point a little subsequent to\r\nthis, had cut short his words in a paroxysm of horror. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God!\xe2\x80\x9d he had\r\nexclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cthink, think what you are saying. It is too incredible, too\r\nmonstrous; such things can never be in this quiet world, where men and\r\nwomen live and die, and struggle, and conquer, or maybe fail, and fall\r\ndown under sorrow, and grieve and suffer strange fortunes for many a\r\nyear; but not this, Phillips, not such things as this. There must be\r\nsome explanation, some way out of the terror. Why, man, if such a case\r\nwere possible, our earth would be a nightmare.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Phillips had told his story to the end, concluding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer flight remains a mystery to this day; she vanished in broad\r\nsunlight; they saw her walking in a meadow, and a few moments later she\r\nwas not there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarke tried to conceive the thing again, as he sat by the fire, and\r\nagain his mind shuddered and shrank back, appalled before the sight of\r\nsuch awful, unspeakable elements enthroned as it were, and triumphant\r\nin human flesh. Before him stretched the long dim vista of the green\r\ncauseway in the forest, as his friend had described it; he saw the\r\nswaying leaves and the quivering shadows on the grass, he saw the\r\nsunlight and the flowers, and far away, far in the long distance, the\r\ntwo figures moved toward him. One was Rachel, but the other?\r\n\r\nClarke had tried his best to disbelieve it all, but at the end of the\r\naccount, as he had written it in his book, he had placed the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\nEt Diabolus incarnatus est. Et homo factus est.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nTHE CITY OF RESURRECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert! Good God! Is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my name\xe2\x80\x99s Herbert. I think I know your face, too, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember your name. My memory is very queer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you recollect Villiers of Wadham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it is, so it is. I beg your pardon, Villiers, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I was\r\nbegging of an old college friend. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, this haste is unnecessary. My rooms are close by, but\r\nwe won\xe2\x80\x99t go there just yet. Suppose we walk up Shaftesbury Avenue a\r\nlittle way? But how in heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name have you come to this pass,\r\nHerbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long story, Villiers, and a strange one too, but you can hear\r\nit if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome on, then. Take my arm, you don\xe2\x80\x99t seem very strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ill-assorted pair moved slowly up Rupert Street; the one in dirty,\r\nevil-looking rags, and the other attired in the regulation uniform of a\r\nman about town, trim, glossy, and eminently well-to-do. Villiers had\r\nemerged from his restaurant after an excellent dinner of many courses,\r\nassisted by an ingratiating little flask of Chianti, and, in that frame\r\nof mind which was with him almost chronic, had delayed a moment by the\r\ndoor, peering round in the dimly-lighted street in search of those\r\nmysterious incidents and persons with which the streets of London teem\r\nin every quarter and every hour. Villiers prided himself as a practised\r\nexplorer of such obscure mazes and byways of London life, and in this\r\nunprofitable pursuit he displayed an assiduity which was worthy of more\r\nserious employment. Thus he stood by the lamp-post surveying the\r\npassers-by with undisguised curiosity, and with that gravity known only\r\nto the systematic diner, had just enunciated in his mind the formula:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLondon has been called the city of encounters; it is more than that,\r\nit is the city of Resurrections,\xe2\x80\x9d when these reflections were suddenly\r\ninterrupted by a piteous whine at his elbow, and a deplorable appeal\r\nfor alms. He looked around in some irritation, and with a sudden shock\r\nfound himself confronted with the embodied proof of his somewhat\r\nstilted fancies. There, close beside him, his face altered and\r\ndisfigured by poverty and disgrace, his body barely covered by greasy\r\nill-fitting rags, stood his old friend Charles Herbert, who had\r\nmatriculated on the same day as himself, with whom he had been merry\r\nand wise for twelve revolving terms. Different occupations and varying\r\ninterests had interrupted the friendship, and it was six years since\r\nVilliers had seen Herbert; and now he looked upon this wreck of a man\r\nwith grief and dismay, mingled with a certain inquisitiveness as to\r\nwhat dreary chain of circumstances had dragged him down to such a\r\ndoleful pass. Villiers felt together with compassion all the relish of\r\nthe amateur in mysteries, and congratulated himself on his leisurely\r\nspeculations outside the restaurant.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence for some time, and more than one passer-by\r\nstared in astonishment at the unaccustomed spectacle of a well-dressed\r\nman with an unmistakable beggar hanging on to his arm, and, observing\r\nthis, Villiers led the way to an obscure street in Soho. Here he\r\nrepeated his question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow on earth has it happened, Herbert? I always understood you would\r\nsucceed to an excellent position in Dorsetshire. Did your father\r\ndisinherit you? Surely not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Villiers; I came into all the property at my poor father\xe2\x80\x99s death;\r\nhe died a year after I left Oxford. He was a very good father to me,\r\nand I mourned his death sincerely enough. But you know what young men\r\nare; a few months later I came up to town and went a good deal into\r\nsociety. Of course I had excellent introductions, and I managed to\r\nenjoy myself very much in a harmless sort of way. I played a little,\r\ncertainly, but never for heavy stakes, and the few bets I made on races\r\nbrought me in money\xe2\x80\x94only a few pounds, you know, but enough to pay for\r\ncigars and such petty pleasures. It was in my second season that the\r\ntide turned. Of course you have heard of my marriage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I never heard anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I married, Villiers. I met a girl, a girl of the most wonderful\r\nand most strange beauty, at the house of some people whom I knew. I\r\ncannot tell you her age; I never knew it, but, so far as I can guess, I\r\nshould think she must have been about nineteen when I made her\r\nacquaintance. My friends had come to know her at Florence; she told\r\nthem she was an orphan, the child of an English father and an Italian\r\nmother, and she charmed them as she charmed me. The first time I saw\r\nher was at an evening party. I was standing by the door talking to a\r\nfriend, when suddenly above the hum and babble of conversation I heard\r\na voice which seemed to thrill to my heart. She was singing an Italian\r\nsong. I was introduced to her that evening, and in three months I\r\nmarried Helen. Villiers, that woman, if I can call her woman, corrupted\r\nmy soul. The night of the wedding I found myself sitting in her bedroom\r\nin the hotel, listening to her talk. She was sitting up in bed, and I\r\nlistened to her as she spoke in her beautiful voice, spoke of things\r\nwhich even now I would not dare whisper in the blackest night, though I\r\nstood in the midst of a wilderness. You, Villiers, you may think you\r\nknow life, and London, and what goes on day and night in this dreadful\r\ncity; for all I can say you may have heard the talk of the vilest, but\r\nI tell you you can have no conception of what I know, not in your most\r\nfantastic, hideous dreams can you have imaged forth the faintest shadow\r\nof what I have heard\xe2\x80\x94and seen. Yes, seen. I have seen the incredible,\r\nsuch horrors that even I myself sometimes stop in the middle of the\r\nstreet and ask whether it is possible for a man to behold such things\r\nand live. In a year, Villiers, I was a ruined man, in body and soul\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nbody and soul.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut your property, Herbert? You had land in Dorset.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sold it all; the fields and woods, the dear old house\xe2\x80\x94everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the money?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe took it all from me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then left you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she disappeared one night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where she went, but I am\r\nsure if I saw her again it would kill me. The rest of my story is of no\r\ninterest; sordid misery, that is all. You may think, Villiers, that I\r\nhave exaggerated and talked for effect; but I have not told you half. I\r\ncould tell you certain things which would convince you, but you would\r\nnever know a happy day again. You would pass the rest of your life, as\r\nI pass mine, a haunted man, a man who has seen hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers took the unfortunate man to his rooms, and gave him a meal.\r\nHerbert could eat little, and scarcely touched the glass of wine set\r\nbefore him. He sat moody and silent by the fire, and seemed relieved\r\nwhen Villiers sent him away with a small present of money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said Villiers, as they parted at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nwas your wife\xe2\x80\x99s name? You said Helen, I think? Helen what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe name she passed under when I met her was Helen Vaughan, but what\r\nher real name was I can\xe2\x80\x99t say. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she had a name. No, no,\r\nnot in that sense. Only human beings have names, Villiers; I can\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nanymore. Good-bye; yes, I will not fail to call if I see any way in\r\nwhich you can help me. Good-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man went out into the bitter night, and Villiers returned to his\r\nfireside. There was something about Herbert which shocked him\r\ninexpressibly; not his poor rags nor the marks which poverty had set\r\nupon his face, but rather an indefinite terror which hung about him\r\nlike a mist. He had acknowledged that he himself was not devoid of\r\nblame; the woman, he had avowed, had corrupted him body and soul, and\r\nVilliers felt that this man, once his friend, had been an actor in\r\nscenes evil beyond the power of words. His story needed no\r\nconfirmation: he himself was the embodied proof of it. Villiers mused\r\ncuriously over the story he had heard, and wondered whether he had\r\nheard both the first and the last of it. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly\r\nnot the last, probably only the beginning. A case like this is like a\r\nnest of Chinese boxes; you open one after the other and find a quainter\r\nworkmanship in every box. Most likely poor Herbert is merely one of the\r\noutside boxes; there are stranger ones to follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers could not take his mind away from Herbert and his story, which\r\nseemed to grow wilder as the night wore on. The fire seemed to burn\r\nlow, and the chilly air of the morning crept into the room; Villiers\r\ngot up with a glance over his shoulder, and, shivering slightly, went\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nA few days later he saw at his club a gentleman of his acquaintance,\r\nnamed Austin, who was famous for his intimate knowledge of London life,\r\nboth in its tenebrous and luminous phases. Villiers, still full of his\r\nencounter in Soho and its consequences, thought Austin might possibly\r\nbe able to shed some light on Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s history, and so after some\r\ncasual talk he suddenly put the question:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you happen to know anything of a man named Herbert\xe2\x80\x94Charles\r\nHerbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin turned round sharply and stared at Villiers with some\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharles Herbert? Weren\xe2\x80\x99t you in town three years ago? No; then you\r\nhave not heard of the Paul Street case? It caused a good deal of\r\nsensation at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a gentleman, a man of very good position, was found dead, stark\r\ndead, in the area of a certain house in Paul Street, off Tottenham\r\nCourt Road. Of course the police did not make the discovery; if you\r\nhappen to be sitting up all night and have a light in your window, the\r\nconstable will ring the bell, but if you happen to be lying dead in\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s area, you will be left alone. In this instance, as in many\r\nothers, the alarm was raised by some kind of vagabond; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a\r\ncommon tramp, or a public-house loafer, but a gentleman, whose business\r\nor pleasure, or both, made him a spectator of the London streets at\r\nfive o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. This individual was, as he said, \xe2\x80\x98going\r\nhome,\xe2\x80\x99 it did not appear whence or whither, and had occasion to pass\r\nthrough Paul Street between four and five a.m. Something or other\r\ncaught his eye at Number 20; he said, absurdly enough, that the house\r\nhad the most unpleasant physiognomy he had ever observed, but, at any\r\nrate, he glanced down the area and was a good deal astonished to see a\r\nman lying on the stones, his limbs all huddled together, and his face\r\nturned up. Our gentleman thought his face looked peculiarly ghastly,\r\nand so set off at a run in search of the nearest policeman. The\r\nconstable was at first inclined to treat the matter lightly, suspecting\r\ncommon drunkenness; however, he came, and after looking at the man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface, changed his tone, quickly enough. The early bird, who had picked\r\nup this fine worm, was sent off for a doctor, and the policeman rang\r\nand knocked at the door till a slatternly servant girl came down\r\nlooking more than half asleep. The constable pointed out the contents\r\nof the area to the maid, who screamed loudly enough to wake up the\r\nstreet, but she knew nothing of the man; had never seen him at the\r\nhouse, and so forth. Meanwhile, the original discoverer had come back\r\nwith a medical man, and the next thing was to get into the area. The\r\ngate was open, so the whole quartet stumped down the steps. The doctor\r\nhardly needed a moment\xe2\x80\x99s examination; he said the poor fellow had been\r\ndead for several hours, and it was then the case began to get\r\ninteresting. The dead man had not been robbed, and in one of his\r\npockets were papers identifying him as\xe2\x80\x94well, as a man of good family\r\nand means, a favourite in society, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemy, as far as could\r\nbe known. I don\xe2\x80\x99t give his name, Villiers, because it has nothing to do\r\nwith the story, and because it\xe2\x80\x99s no good raking up these affairs about\r\nthe dead when there are no relations living. The next curious point was\r\nthat the medical men couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree as to how he met his death. There\r\nwere some slight bruises on his shoulders, but they were so slight that\r\nit looked as if he had been pushed roughly out of the kitchen door, and\r\nnot thrown over the railings from the street or even dragged down the\r\nsteps. But there were positively no other marks of violence about him,\r\ncertainly none that would account for his death; and when they came to\r\nthe autopsy there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a trace of poison of any kind. Of course the\r\npolice wanted to know all about the people at Number 20, and here\r\nagain, so I have heard from private sources, one or two other very\r\ncurious points came out. It appears that the occupants of the house\r\nwere a Mr. and Mrs. Charles Herbert; he was said to be a landed\r\nproprietor, though it struck most people that Paul Street was not\r\nexactly the place to look for country gentry. As for Mrs. Herbert,\r\nnobody seemed to know who or what she was, and, between ourselves, I\r\nfancy the divers after her history found themselves in rather strange\r\nwaters. Of course they both denied knowing anything about the deceased,\r\nand in default of any evidence against them they were discharged. But\r\nsome very odd things came out about them. Though it was between five\r\nand six in the morning when the dead man was removed, a large crowd had\r\ncollected, and several of the neighbours ran to see what was going on.\r\nThey were pretty free with their comments, by all accounts, and from\r\nthese it appeared that Number 20 was in very bad odour in Paul Street.\r\nThe detectives tried to trace down these rumours to some solid\r\nfoundation of fact, but could not get hold of anything. People shook\r\ntheir heads and raised their eyebrows and thought the Herberts rather\r\n\xe2\x80\x98queer,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98would rather not be seen going into their house,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on,\r\nbut there was nothing tangible. The authorities were morally certain\r\nthe man met his death in some way or another in the house and was\r\nthrown out by the kitchen door, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prove it, and the\r\nabsence of any indications of violence or poisoning left them helpless.\r\nAn odd case, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But curiously enough, there\xe2\x80\x99s something more\r\nthat I haven\xe2\x80\x99t told you. I happened to know one of the doctors who was\r\nconsulted as to the cause of death, and some time after the inquest I\r\nmet him, and asked him about it. \xe2\x80\x98Do you really mean to tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98that you were baffled by the case, that you actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat the man died of?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Pardon me,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98I know perfectly well\r\nwhat caused death. Blank died of fright, of sheer, awful terror; I\r\nnever saw features so hideously contorted in the entire course of my\r\npractice, and I have seen the faces of a whole host of dead.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\ndoctor was usually a cool customer enough, and a certain vehemence in\r\nhis manner struck me, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get anything more out of him. I\r\nsuppose the Treasury didn\xe2\x80\x99t see their way to prosecuting the Herberts\r\nfor frightening a man to death; at any rate, nothing was done, and the\r\ncase dropped out of men\xe2\x80\x99s minds. Do you happen to know anything of\r\nHerbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Villiers, \xe2\x80\x9che was an old college friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so? Have you ever seen his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. I have lost sight of Herbert for many years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s queer, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, parting with a man at the college gate or at\r\nPaddington, seeing nothing of him for years, and then finding him pop\r\nup his head in such an odd place. But I should like to have seen Mrs.\r\nHerbert; people said extraordinary things about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hardly know how to tell you. Everyone who saw her at the\r\npolice court said she was at once the most beautiful woman and the most\r\nrepulsive they had ever set eyes on. I have spoken to a man who saw\r\nher, and I assure you he positively shuddered as he tried to describe\r\nthe woman, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell why. She seems to have been a sort of\r\nenigma; and I expect if that one dead man could have told tales, he\r\nwould have told some uncommonly queer ones. And there you are again in\r\nanother puzzle; what could a respectable country gentleman like Mr.\r\nBlank (we\xe2\x80\x99ll call him that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind) want in such a very queer\r\nhouse as Number 20? It\xe2\x80\x99s altogether a very odd case, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed, Austin; an extraordinary case. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think, when I\r\nasked you about my old friend, I should strike on such strange metal.\r\nWell, I must be off; good-day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers went away, thinking of his own conceit of the Chinese boxes;\r\nhere was quaint workmanship indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTHE DISCOVERY IN PAUL STREET\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months after Villiers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting with Herbert, Mr. Clarke was\r\nsitting, as usual, by his after-dinner hearth, resolutely guarding his\r\nfancies from wandering in the direction of the bureau. For more than a\r\nweek he had succeeded in keeping away from the \xe2\x80\x9cMemoirs,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\r\ncherished hopes of a complete self-reformation; but, in spite of his\r\nendeavours, he could not hush the wonder and the strange curiosity that\r\nthe last case he had written down had excited within him. He had put\r\nthe case, or rather the outline of it, conjecturally to a scientific\r\nfriend, who shook his head, and thought Clarke getting queer, and on\r\nthis particular evening Clarke was making an effort to rationalize the\r\nstory, when a sudden knock at the door roused him from his meditations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Villiers to see you sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me, Villiers, it is very kind of you to look me up; I have not\r\nseen you for many months; I should think nearly a year. Come in, come\r\nin. And how are you, Villiers? Want any advice about investments?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thanks, I fancy everything I have in that way is pretty safe. No,\r\nClarke, I have really come to consult you about a rather curious matter\r\nthat has been brought under my notice of late. I am afraid you will\r\nthink it all rather absurd when I tell my tale. I sometimes think so\r\nmyself, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just why I made up my mind to come to you, as I know\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a practical man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers was ignorant of the \xe2\x80\x9cMemoirs to prove the Existence of the\r\nDevil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Villiers, I shall be happy to give you my advice, to the best of\r\nmy ability. What is the nature of the case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary thing altogether. You know my ways; I always\r\nkeep my eyes open in the streets, and in my time I have chanced upon\r\nsome queer customers, and queer cases too, but this, I think, beats\r\nall. I was coming out of a restaurant one nasty winter night about\r\nthree months ago; I had had a capital dinner and a good bottle of\r\nChianti, and I stood for a moment on the pavement, thinking what a\r\nmystery there is about London streets and the companies that pass along\r\nthem. A bottle of red wine encourages these fancies, Clarke, and I dare\r\nsay I should have thought a page of small type, but I was cut short by\r\na beggar who had come behind me, and was making the usual appeals. Of\r\ncourse I looked round, and this beggar turned out to be what was left\r\nof an old friend of mine, a man named Herbert. I asked him how he had\r\ncome to such a wretched pass, and he told me. We walked up and down one\r\nof those long and dark Soho streets, and there I listened to his story.\r\nHe said he had married a beautiful girl, some years younger than\r\nhimself, and, as he put it, she had corrupted him body and soul. He\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into details; he said he dare not, that what he had seen\r\nand heard haunted him by night and day, and when I looked in his face I\r\nknew he was speaking the truth. There was something about the man that\r\nmade me shiver. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but it was there. I gave him a little\r\nmoney and sent him away, and I assure you that when he was gone I\r\ngasped for breath. His presence seemed to chill one\xe2\x80\x99s blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t this all just a little fanciful, Villiers? I suppose the poor\r\nfellow had made an imprudent marriage, and, in plain English, gone to\r\nthe bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, listen to this.\xe2\x80\x9d Villiers told Clarke the story he had heard\r\nfrom Austin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be but little doubt that this Mr.\r\nBlank, whoever he was, died of sheer terror; he saw something so awful,\r\nso terrible, that it cut short his life. And what he saw, he most\r\ncertainly saw in that house, which, somehow or other, had got a bad\r\nname in the neighbourhood. I had the curiosity to go and look at the\r\nplace for myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s a saddening kind of street; the houses are old\r\nenough to be mean and dreary, but not old enough to be quaint. As far\r\nas I could see most of them are let in lodgings, furnished and\r\nunfurnished, and almost every door has three bells to it. Here and\r\nthere the ground floors have been made into shops of the commonest\r\nkind; it\xe2\x80\x99s a dismal street in every way. I found Number 20 was to let,\r\nand I went to the agent\xe2\x80\x99s and got the key. Of course I should have\r\nheard nothing of the Herberts in that quarter, but I asked the man,\r\nfair and square, how long they had left the house and whether there had\r\nbeen other tenants in the meanwhile. He looked at me queerly for a\r\nminute, and told me the Herberts had left immediately after the\r\nunpleasantness, as he called it, and since then the house had been\r\nempty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have always been rather fond of going over empty houses; there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsort of fascination about the desolate empty rooms, with the nails\r\nsticking in the walls, and the dust thick upon the window-sills. But I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy going over Number 20, Paul Street. I had hardly put my\r\nfoot inside the passage when I noticed a queer, heavy feeling about the\r\nair of the house. Of course all empty houses are stuffy, and so forth,\r\nbut this was something quite different; I can\xe2\x80\x99t describe it to you, but\r\nit seemed to stop the breath. I went into the front room and the back\r\nroom, and the kitchens downstairs; they were all dirty and dusty\r\nenough, as you would expect, but there was something strange about them\r\nall. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t define it to you, I only know I felt queer. It was one\r\nof the rooms on the first floor, though, that was the worst. It was a\r\nlargish room, and once on a time the paper must have been cheerful\r\nenough, but when I saw it, paint, paper, and everything were most\r\ndoleful. But the room was full of horror; I felt my teeth grinding as I\r\nput my hand on the door, and when I went in, I thought I should have\r\nfallen fainting to the floor. However, I pulled myself together, and\r\nstood against the end wall, wondering what on earth there could be\r\nabout the room to make my limbs tremble, and my heart beat as if I were\r\nat the hour of death. In one corner there was a pile of newspapers\r\nlittered on the floor, and I began looking at them; they were papers of\r\nthree or four years ago, some of them half torn, and some crumpled as\r\nif they had been used for packing. I turned the whole pile over, and\r\namongst them I found a curious drawing; I will show it to you\r\npresently. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in the room; I felt it was overpowering\r\nme. I was thankful to come out, safe and sound, into the open air.\r\nPeople stared at me as I walked along the street, and one man said I\r\nwas drunk. I was staggering about from one side of the pavement to the\r\nother, and it was as much as I could do to take the key back to the\r\nagent and get home. I was in bed for a week, suffering from what my\r\ndoctor called nervous shock and exhaustion. One of those days I was\r\nreading the evening paper, and happened to notice a paragraph headed:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Starved to Death.\xe2\x80\x99 It was the usual style of thing; a model\r\nlodging-house in Marylebone, a door locked for several days, and a dead\r\nman in his chair when they broke in. \xe2\x80\x98The deceased,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nparagraph, \xe2\x80\x98was known as Charles Herbert, and is believed to have been\r\nonce a prosperous country gentleman. His name was familiar to the\r\npublic three years ago in connection with the mysterious death in Paul\r\nStreet, Tottenham Court Road, the deceased being the tenant of the\r\nhouse Number 20, in the area of which a gentleman of good position was\r\nfound dead under circumstances not devoid of suspicion.\xe2\x80\x99 A tragic\r\nending, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? But after all, if what he told me were true, which I\r\nam sure it was, the man\xe2\x80\x99s life was all a tragedy, and a tragedy of a\r\nstranger sort than they put on the boards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is the story, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarke musingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is the story.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, really, Villiers, I scarcely know what to say about it. There\r\nare, no doubt, circumstances in the case which seem peculiar, the\r\nfinding of the dead man in the area of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s house, for instance,\r\nand the extraordinary opinion of the physician as to the cause of\r\ndeath; but, after all, it is conceivable that the facts may be\r\nexplained in a straightforward manner. As to your own sensations, when\r\nyou went to see the house, I would suggest that they were due to a\r\nvivid imagination; you must have been brooding, in a semi-conscious\r\nway, over what you had heard. I don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly see what more can be said\r\nor done in the matter; you evidently think there is a mystery of some\r\nkind, but Herbert is dead; where then do you propose to look?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI propose to look for the woman; the woman whom he married. _She_ is\r\nthe mystery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men sat silent by the fireside; Clarke secretly congratulating\r\nhimself on having successfully kept up the character of advocate of the\r\ncommonplace, and Villiers wrapped in his gloomy fancies.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I will have a cigarette,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last, and put his hand in\r\nhis pocket to feel for the cigarette-case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, starting slightly, \xe2\x80\x9cI forgot I had something to show\r\nyou. You remember my saying that I had found a rather curious sketch\r\namongst the pile of old newspapers at the house in Paul Street? Here it\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers drew out a small thin parcel from his pocket. It was covered\r\nwith brown paper, and secured with string, and the knots were\r\ntroublesome. In spite of himself Clarke felt inquisitive; he bent\r\nforward on his chair as Villiers painfully undid the string, and\r\nunfolded the outer covering. Inside was a second wrapping of tissue,\r\nand Villiers took it off and handed the small piece of paper to Clarke\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\nThere was dead silence in the room for five minutes or more; the two\r\nmen sat so still that they could hear the ticking of the tall\r\nold-fashioned clock that stood outside in the hall, and in the mind of\r\none of them the slow monotony of sound woke up a far, far memory. He\r\nwas looking intently at the small pen-and-ink sketch of the woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead; it had evidently been drawn with great care, and by a true\r\nartist, for the woman\xe2\x80\x99s soul looked out of the eyes, and the lips were\r\nparted with a strange smile. Clarke gazed still at the face; it brought\r\nto his memory one summer evening, long ago; he saw again the long\r\nlovely valley, the river winding between the hills, the meadows and the\r\ncornfields, the dull red sun, and the cold white mist rising from the\r\nwater. He heard a voice speaking to him across the waves of many years,\r\nand saying \xe2\x80\x9cClarke, Mary will see the god Pan!\xe2\x80\x9d and then he was\r\nstanding in the grim room beside the doctor, listening to the heavy\r\nticking of the clock, waiting and watching, watching the figure lying\r\non the green chair beneath the lamplight. Mary rose up, and he looked\r\ninto her eyes, and his heart grew cold within him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is this woman?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at last. His voice was dry and hoarse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the woman who Herbert married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarke looked again at the sketch; it was not Mary after all. There\r\ncertainly was Mary\xe2\x80\x99s face, but there was something else, something he\r\nhad not seen on Mary\xe2\x80\x99s features when the white-clad girl entered the\r\nlaboratory with the doctor, nor at her terrible awakening, nor when she\r\nlay grinning on the bed. Whatever it was, the glance that came from\r\nthose eyes, the smile on the full lips, or the expression of the whole\r\nface, Clarke shuddered before it at his inmost soul, and thought,\r\nunconsciously, of Dr. Phillip\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most vivid presentment of\r\nevil I have ever seen.\xe2\x80\x9d He turned the paper over mechanically in his\r\nhand and glanced at the back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God! Clarke, what is the matter? You are as white as death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers had started wildly from his chair, as Clarke fell back with a\r\ngroan, and let the paper drop from his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel very well, Villiers, I am subject to these attacks. Pour\r\nme out a little wine; thanks, that will do. I shall feel better in a\r\nfew minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers picked up the fallen sketch and turned it over as Clarke had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how I identified it as being a\r\nportrait of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s wife, or I should say his widow. How do you feel\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter, thanks, it was only a passing faintness. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I quite\r\ncatch your meaning. What did you say enabled you to identify the\r\npicture?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis word\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Helen\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94was written on the back. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you her name\r\nwas Helen? Yes; Helen Vaughan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClarke groaned; there could be no shadow of doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t you agree with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Villiers, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in the story I\r\nhave told you to-night, and in the part this woman plays in it, there\r\nare some very strange points?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Villiers,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a strange story indeed; a\r\nstrange story indeed. You must give me time to think it over; I may be\r\nable to help you or I may not. Must you be going now? Well, good-night,\r\nVilliers, good-night. Come and see me in the course of a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nTHE LETTER OF ADVICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d said Villiers, as the two friends were pacing\r\nsedately along Piccadilly one pleasant morning in May, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know I\r\nam convinced that what you told me about Paul Street and the Herberts\r\nis a mere episode in an extraordinary history? I may as well confess to\r\nyou that when I asked you about Herbert a few months ago I had just\r\nseen him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had seen him? Where?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe begged of me in the street one night. He was in the most pitiable\r\nplight, but I recognized the man, and I got him to tell me his history,\r\nor at least the outline of it. In brief, it amounted to this\xe2\x80\x94he had\r\nbeen ruined by his wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what manner?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would not tell me; he would only say that she had destroyed him,\r\nbody and soul. The man is dead now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what has become of his wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I should like to know, and I mean to find her sooner\r\nor later. I know a man named Clarke, a dry fellow, in fact a man of\r\nbusiness, but shrewd enough. You understand my meaning; not shrewd in\r\nthe mere business sense of the word, but a man who really knows\r\nsomething about men and life. Well, I laid the case before him, and he\r\nwas evidently impressed. He said it needed consideration, and asked me\r\nto come again in the course of a week. A few days later I received this\r\nextraordinary letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin took the envelope, drew out the letter, and read it curiously.\r\nIt ran as follows:\xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR VILLIERS,\xe2\x80\x94I have thought over the matter on which you\r\nconsulted me the other night, and my advice to you is this. Throw the\r\nportrait into the fire, blot out the story from your mind. Never give\r\nit another thought, Villiers, or you will be sorry. You will think, no\r\ndoubt, that I am in possession of some secret information, and to a\r\ncertain extent that is the case. But I only know a little; I am like a\r\ntraveller who has peered over an abyss, and has drawn back in terror.\r\nWhat I know is strange enough and horrible enough, but beyond my\r\nknowledge there are depths and horrors more frightful still, more\r\nincredible than any tale told of winter nights about the fire. I have\r\nresolved, and nothing shall shake that resolve, to explore no whit\r\nfarther, and if you value your happiness you will make the same\r\ndetermination.\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cCome and see me by all means; but we will talk on more cheerful\r\n    topics than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nAustin folded the letter methodically, and returned it to Villiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certainly an extraordinary letter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does he mean\r\nby the portrait?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I forgot to tell you I have been to Paul Street and have made a\r\ndiscovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers told his story as he had told it to Clarke, and Austin\r\nlistened in silence. He seemed puzzled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow very curious that you should experience such an unpleasant\r\nsensation in that room!\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length. \xe2\x80\x9cI hardly gather that it\r\nwas a mere matter of the imagination; a feeling of repulsion, in\r\nshort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was more physical than mental. It was as if I were inhaling at\r\nevery breath some deadly fume, which seemed to penetrate to every nerve\r\nand bone and sinew of my body. I felt racked from head to foot, my eyes\r\nbegan to grow dim; it was like the entrance of death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, very strange certainly. You see, your friend confesses that\r\nthere is some very black story connected with this woman. Did you\r\nnotice any particular emotion in him when you were telling your tale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I did. He became very faint, but he assured me that it was a mere\r\npassing attack to which he was subject.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you believe him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did at the time, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t now. He heard what I had to say with a\r\ngood deal of indifference, till I showed him the portrait. It was then\r\nthat he was seized with the attack of which I spoke. He looked ghastly,\r\nI assure you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he must have seen the woman before. But there might be another\r\nexplanation; it might have been the name, and not the face, which was\r\nfamiliar to him. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say. To the best of my belief it was after turning the\r\nportrait in his hands that he nearly dropped from the chair. The name,\r\nyou know, was written on the back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so. After all, it is impossible to come to any resolution in a\r\ncase like this. I hate melodrama, and nothing strikes me as more\r\ncommonplace and tedious than the ordinary ghost story of commerce; but\r\nreally, Villiers, it looks as if there were something very queer at the\r\nbottom of all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men had, without noticing it, turned up Ashley Street, leading\r\nnorthward from Piccadilly. It was a long street, and rather a gloomy\r\none, but here and there a brighter taste had illuminated the dark\r\nhouses with flowers, and gay curtains, and a cheerful paint on the\r\ndoors. Villiers glanced up as Austin stopped speaking, and looked at\r\none of these houses; geraniums, red and white, drooped from every sill,\r\nand daffodil-coloured curtains were draped back from each window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks cheerful, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the inside is still more cheery. One of the pleasantest\r\nhouses of the season, so I have heard. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been there myself, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve met several men who have, and they tell me it\xe2\x80\x99s uncommonly\r\njovial.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose house is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Mrs. Beaumont\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who is she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. I have heard she comes from South America, but\r\nafter all, who she is is of little consequence. She is a very wealthy\r\nwoman, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt of that, and some of the best people have taken\r\nher up. I hear she has some wonderful claret, really marvellous wine,\r\nwhich must have cost a fabulous sum. Lord Argentine was telling me\r\nabout it; he was there last Sunday evening. He assures me he has never\r\ntasted such a wine, and Argentine, as you know, is an expert. By the\r\nway, that reminds me, she must be an oddish sort of woman, this Mrs.\r\nBeaumont. Argentine asked her how old the wine was, and what do you\r\nthink she said? \xe2\x80\x98About a thousand years, I believe.\xe2\x80\x99 Lord Argentine\r\nthought she was chaffing him, you know, but when he laughed she said\r\nshe was speaking quite seriously and offered to show him the jar. Of\r\ncourse, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything more after that; but it seems rather\r\nantiquated for a beverage, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Why, here we are at my rooms.\r\nCome in, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, I think I will. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the curiosity-shop for a\r\nwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a room furnished richly, yet oddly, where every jar and bookcase\r\nand table, and every rug and jar and ornament seemed to be a thing\r\napart, preserving each its own individuality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything fresh lately?\xe2\x80\x9d said Villiers after a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I think not; you saw those queer jugs, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? I thought so. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think I have come across anything for the last few weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin glanced around the room from cupboard to cupboard, from shelf to\r\nshelf, in search of some new oddity. His eyes fell at last on an odd\r\nchest, pleasantly and quaintly carved, which stood in a dark corner of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was forgetting, I have got something to show you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAustin unlocked the chest, drew out a thick quarto volume, laid it on\r\nthe table, and resumed the cigar he had put down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you know Arthur Meyrick the painter, Villiers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little; I met him two or three times at the house of a friend of\r\nmine. What has become of him? I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard his name mentioned for\r\nsome time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so! Quite young, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; only thirty when he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did he die of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He was an intimate friend of mine, and a thoroughly good\r\nfellow. He used to come here and talk to me for hours, and he was one\r\nof the best talkers I have met. He could even talk about painting, and\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s more than can be said of most painters. About eighteen months\r\nago he was feeling rather overworked, and partly at my suggestion he\r\nwent off on a sort of roving expedition, with no very definite end or\r\naim about it. I believe New York was to be his first port, but I never\r\nheard from him. Three months ago I got this book, with a very civil\r\nletter from an English doctor practising at Buenos Ayres, stating that\r\nhe had attended the late Mr. Meyrick during his illness, and that the\r\ndeceased had expressed an earnest wish that the enclosed packet should\r\nbe sent to me after his death. That was all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd haven\xe2\x80\x99t you written for further particulars?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking of doing so. You would advise me to write to the\r\ndoctor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. And what about the book?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was sealed up when I got it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the doctor had seen it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is something very rare? Meyrick was a collector, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I think not, hardly a collector. Now, what do you think of these\r\nAinu jugs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are peculiar, but I like them. But aren\xe2\x80\x99t you going to show me\r\npoor Meyrick\xe2\x80\x99s legacy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, to be sure. The fact is, it\xe2\x80\x99s rather a peculiar sort of\r\nthing, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t shown it to any one. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about\r\nit if I were you. There it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers took the book, and opened it at haphazard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a printed volume, then?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. It is a collection of drawings in black and white by my poor\r\nfriend Meyrick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers turned to the first page, it was blank; the second bore a\r\nbrief inscription, which he read:\r\n\r\nSilet per diem universus, nec sine horrore secretus est; lucet\r\nnocturnis ignibus, chorus \xc3\x86gipanum undique personatur: audiuntur et\r\ncantus tibiarum, et tinnitus cymbalorum per oram maritimam.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the third page was a design which made Villiers start and look up at\r\nAustin; he was gazing abstractedly out of the window. Villiers turned\r\npage after page, absorbed, in spite of himself, in the frightful\r\nWalpurgis Night of evil, strange monstrous evil, that the dead artist\r\nhad set forth in hard black and white. The figures of Fauns and Satyrs\r\nand \xc3\x86gipans danced before his eyes, the darkness of the thicket, the\r\ndance on the mountain-top, the scenes by lonely shores, in green\r\nvineyards, by rocks and desert places, passed before him: a world\r\nbefore which the human soul seemed to shrink back and shudder. Villiers\r\nwhirled over the remaining pages; he had seen enough, but the picture\r\non the last leaf caught his eye, as he almost closed the book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAustin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know who that is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a woman\xe2\x80\x99s face, alone on the white page.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow who it is? No, of course not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Mrs. Herbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am perfectly sure of it. Poor Meyrick! He is one more chapter in her\r\nhistory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what do you think of the designs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are frightful. Lock the book up again, Austin. If I were you I\r\nwould burn it; it must be a terrible companion even though it be in a\r\nchest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they are singular drawings. But I wonder what connection there\r\ncould be between Meyrick and Mrs. Herbert, or what link between her and\r\nthese designs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, who can say? It is possible that the matter may end here, and we\r\nshall never know, but in my own opinion this Helen Vaughan, or Mrs.\r\nHerbert, is only the beginning. She will come back to London, Austin;\r\ndepend on it, she will come back, and we shall hear more about her\r\nthen. I doubt it will be very pleasant news.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nTHE SUICIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Argentine was a great favourite in London Society. At twenty he\r\nhad been a poor man, decked with the surname of an illustrious family,\r\nbut forced to earn a livelihood as best he could, and the most\r\nspeculative of money-lenders would not have entrusted him with fifty\r\npounds on the chance of his ever changing his name for a title, and his\r\npoverty for a great fortune. His father had been near enough to the\r\nfountain of good things to secure one of the family livings, but the\r\nson, even if he had taken orders, would scarcely have obtained so much\r\nas this, and moreover felt no vocation for the ecclesiastical estate.\r\nThus he fronted the world with no better armour than the bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngown and the wits of a younger son\xe2\x80\x99s grandson, with which equipment he\r\ncontrived in some way to make a very tolerable fight of it. At\r\ntwenty-five Mr. Charles Aubernon saw himself still a man of struggles\r\nand of warfare with the world, but out of the seven who stood before\r\nhim and the high places of his family three only remained. These three,\r\nhowever, were \xe2\x80\x9cgood lives,\xe2\x80\x9d but yet not proof against the Zulu assegais\r\nand typhoid fever, and so one morning Aubernon woke up and found\r\nhimself Lord Argentine, a man of thirty who had faced the difficulties\r\nof existence, and had conquered. The situation amused him immensely,\r\nand he resolved that riches should be as pleasant to him as poverty had\r\nalways been. Argentine, after some little consideration, came to the\r\nconclusion that dining, regarded as a fine art, was perhaps the most\r\namusing pursuit open to fallen humanity, and thus his dinners became\r\nfamous in London, and an invitation to his table a thing covetously\r\ndesired. After ten years of lordship and dinners Argentine still\r\ndeclined to be jaded, still persisted in enjoying life, and by a kind\r\nof infection had become recognized as the cause of joy in others, in\r\nshort, as the best of company. His sudden and tragical death therefore\r\ncaused a wide and deep sensation. People could scarcely believe it,\r\neven though the newspaper was before their eyes, and the cry of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMysterious Death of a Nobleman\xe2\x80\x9d came ringing up from the street. But\r\nthere stood the brief paragraph: \xe2\x80\x9cLord Argentine was found dead this\r\nmorning by his valet under distressing circumstances. It is stated that\r\nthere can be no doubt that his lordship committed suicide, though no\r\nmotive can be assigned for the act. The deceased nobleman was widely\r\nknown in society, and much liked for his genial manner and sumptuous\r\nhospitality. He is succeeded by,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., etc.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees the details came to light, but the case still remained\r\na mystery. The chief witness at the inquest was the deceased\xe2\x80\x99s valet,\r\nwho said that the night before his death Lord Argentine had dined with\r\na lady of good position, whose name was suppressed in the newspaper\r\nreports. At about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock Lord Argentine had returned, and\r\ninformed his man that he should not require his services till the next\r\nmorning. A little later the valet had occasion to cross the hall and\r\nwas somewhat astonished to see his master quietly letting himself out\r\nat the front door. He had taken off his evening clothes, and was\r\ndressed in a Norfolk coat and knickerbockers, and wore a low brown hat.\r\nThe valet had no reason to suppose that Lord Argentine had seen him,\r\nand though his master rarely kept late hours, thought little of the\r\noccurrence till the next morning, when he knocked at the bedroom door\r\nat a quarter to nine as usual. He received no answer, and, after\r\nknocking two or three times, entered the room, and saw Lord Argentine\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbody leaning forward at an angle from the bottom of the bed. He found\r\nthat his master had tied a cord securely to one of the short bed-posts,\r\nand, after making a running noose and slipping it round his neck, the\r\nunfortunate man must have resolutely fallen forward, to die by slow\r\nstrangulation. He was dressed in the light suit in which the valet had\r\nseen him go out, and the doctor who was summoned pronounced that life\r\nhad been extinct for more than four hours. All papers, letters, and so\r\nforth seemed in perfect order, and nothing was discovered which pointed\r\nin the most remote way to any scandal either great or small. Here the\r\nevidence ended; nothing more could be discovered. Several persons had\r\nbeen present at the dinner-party at which Lord Argentine had assisted,\r\nand to all these he seemed in his usual genial spirits. The valet,\r\nindeed, said he thought his master appeared a little excited when he\r\ncame home, but confessed that the alteration in his manner was very\r\nslight, hardly noticeable, indeed. It seemed hopeless to seek for any\r\nclue, and the suggestion that Lord Argentine had been suddenly attacked\r\nby acute suicidal mania was generally accepted.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise, however, when within three weeks, three more\r\ngentlemen, one of them a nobleman, and the two others men of good\r\nposition and ample means, perished miserably in the almost precisely\r\nthe same manner. Lord Swanleigh was found one morning in his\r\ndressing-room, hanging from a peg affixed to the wall, and Mr.\r\nCollier-Stuart and Mr. Herries had chosen to die as Lord Argentine.\r\nThere was no explanation in either case; a few bald facts; a living man\r\nin the evening, and a body with a black swollen face in the morning.\r\nThe police had been forced to confess themselves powerless to arrest or\r\nto explain the sordid murders of Whitechapel; but before the horrible\r\nsuicides of Piccadilly and Mayfair they were dumbfoundered, for not\r\neven the mere ferocity which did duty as an explanation of the crimes\r\nof the East End, could be of service in the West. Each of these men who\r\nhad resolved to die a tortured shameful death was rich, prosperous, and\r\nto all appearances in love with the world, and not the acutest research\r\nshould ferret out any shadow of a lurking motive in either case. There\r\nwas a horror in the air, and men looked at one another\xe2\x80\x99s faces when\r\nthey met, each wondering whether the other was to be the victim of the\r\nfifth nameless tragedy. Journalists sought in vain for their scrapbooks\r\nfor materials whereof to concoct reminiscent articles; and the morning\r\npaper was unfolded in many a house with a feeling of awe; no man knew\r\nwhen or where the next blow would light.\r\n\r\nA short while after the last of these terrible events, Austin came to\r\nsee Mr. Villiers. He was curious to know whether Villiers had succeeded\r\nin discovering any fresh traces of Mrs. Herbert, either through Clarke\r\nor by other sources, and he asked the question soon after he had sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Villiers, \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote to Clarke, but he remains obdurate, and I\r\nhave tried other channels, but without any result. I can\xe2\x80\x99t find out\r\nwhat became of Helen Vaughan after she left Paul Street, but I think\r\nshe must have gone abroad. But to tell the truth, Austin, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npaid much attention to the matter for the last few weeks; I knew poor\r\nHerries intimately, and his terrible death has been a great shock to\r\nme, a great shock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can well believe it,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Austin gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know Argentine\r\nwas a friend of mine. If I remember rightly, we were speaking of him\r\nthat day you came to my rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it was in connection with that house in Ashley Street, Mrs.\r\nBeaumont\xe2\x80\x99s house. You said something about Argentine\xe2\x80\x99s dining there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so. Of course you know it was there Argentine dined the night\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x94before his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I had not heard that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; the name was kept out of the papers to spare Mrs. Beaumont.\r\nArgentine was a great favourite of hers, and it is said she was in a\r\nterrible state for sometime after.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA curious look came over Villiers\xe2\x80\x99 face; he seemed undecided whether to\r\nspeak or not. Austin began again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never experienced such a feeling of horror as when I read the\r\naccount of Argentine\xe2\x80\x99s death. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand it at the time, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t now. I knew him well, and it completely passes my understanding\r\nfor what possible cause he\xe2\x80\x94or any of the others for the matter of\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94could have resolved in cold blood to die in such an awful manner.\r\nYou know how men babble away each other\xe2\x80\x99s characters in London, you may\r\nbe sure any buried scandal or hidden skeleton would have been brought\r\nto light in such a case as this; but nothing of the sort has taken\r\nplace. As for the theory of mania, that is very well, of course, for\r\nthe coroner\xe2\x80\x99s jury, but everybody knows that it\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense.\r\nSuicidal mania is not small-pox.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin relapsed into gloomy silence. Villiers sat silent, also,\r\nwatching his friend. The expression of indecision still fleeted across\r\nhis face; he seemed as if weighing his thoughts in the balance, and the\r\nconsiderations he was resolving left him still silent. Austin tried to\r\nshake off the remembrance of tragedies as hopeless and perplexed as the\r\nlabyrinth of Daedalus, and began to talk in an indifferent voice of the\r\nmore pleasant incidents and adventures of the season.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat Mrs. Beaumont,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cof whom we were speaking, is a great\r\nsuccess; she has taken London almost by storm. I met her the other\r\nnight at Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s; she is really a remarkable woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have met Mrs. Beaumont?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she had quite a court around her. She would be called very\r\nhandsome, I suppose, and yet there is something about her face which I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t like. The features are exquisite, but the expression is strange.\r\nAnd all the time I was looking at her, and afterwards, when I was going\r\nhome, I had a curious feeling that very expression was in some way or\r\nanother familiar to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have seen her in the Row.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am sure I never set eyes on the woman before; it is that which\r\nmakes it puzzling. And to the best of my belief I have never seen\r\nanyone like her; what I felt was a kind of dim far-off memory, vague\r\nbut persistent. The only sensation I can compare it to, is that odd\r\nfeeling one sometimes has in a dream, when fantastic cities and\r\nwondrous lands and phantom personages appear familiar and accustomed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers nodded and glanced aimlessly round the room, possibly in\r\nsearch of something on which to turn the conversation. His eyes fell on\r\nan old chest somewhat like that in which the artist\xe2\x80\x99s strange legacy\r\nlay hid beneath a Gothic scutcheon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you written to the doctor about poor Meyrick?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I wrote asking for full particulars as to his illness and death.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to have an answer for another three weeks or a month. I\r\nthought I might as well inquire whether Meyrick knew an Englishwoman\r\nnamed Herbert, and if so, whether the doctor could give me any\r\ninformation about her. But it\xe2\x80\x99s very possible that Meyrick fell in with\r\nher at New York, or Mexico, or San Francisco; I have no idea as to the\r\nextent or direction of his travels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very possible that the woman may have more than one\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly. I wish I had thought of asking you to lend me the portrait of\r\nher which you possess. I might have enclosed it in my letter to Dr.\r\nMatthews.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you might; that never occurred to me. We might send it now. Hark!\r\nwhat are those boys calling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile the two men had been talking together a confused noise of\r\nshouting had been gradually growing louder. The noise rose from the\r\neastward and swelled down Piccadilly, drawing nearer and nearer, a very\r\ntorrent of sound; surging up streets usually quiet, and making every\r\nwindow a frame for a face, curious or excited. The cries and voices\r\ncame echoing up the silent street where Villiers lived, growing more\r\ndistinct as they advanced, and, as Villiers spoke, an answer rang up\r\nfrom the pavement:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe West End Horrors; Another Awful Suicide; Full Details!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin rushed down the stairs and bought a paper and read out the\r\nparagraph to Villiers as the uproar in the street rose and fell. The\r\nwindow was open and the air seemed full of noise and terror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother gentleman has fallen a victim to the terrible epidemic of\r\nsuicide which for the last month has prevailed in the West End. Mr.\r\nSidney Crashaw, of Stoke House, Fulham, and King\xe2\x80\x99s Pomeroy, Devon, was\r\nfound, after a prolonged search, hanging dead from the branch of a tree\r\nin his garden at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock today. The deceased gentleman dined last\r\nnight at the Carlton Club and seemed in his usual health and spirits.\r\nHe left the club at about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and was seen walking leisurely\r\nup St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Street a little later. Subsequent to this his movements\r\ncannot be traced. On the discovery of the body medical aid was at once\r\nsummoned, but life had evidently been long extinct. So far as is known,\r\nMr. Crashaw had no trouble or anxiety of any kind. This painful\r\nsuicide, it will be remembered, is the fifth of the kind in the last\r\nmonth. The authorities at Scotland Yard are unable to suggest any\r\nexplanation of these terrible occurrences.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin put down the paper in mute horror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall leave London to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a city of nightmares.\r\nHow awful this is, Villiers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers was sitting by the window quietly looking out into the\r\nstreet. He had listened to the newspaper report attentively, and the\r\nhint of indecision was no longer on his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment, Austin,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have made up my mind to mention\r\na little matter that occurred last night. It stated, I think, that\r\nCrashaw was last seen alive in St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Street shortly after ten?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so. I will look again. Yes, you are quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so. Well, I am in a position to contradict that statement at all\r\nevents. Crashaw was seen after that; considerably later indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I happened to see Crashaw myself at about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock this\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw Crashaw? You, Villiers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I saw him quite distinctly; indeed, there were but a few feet\r\nbetween us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, did you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot far from here. I saw him in Ashley Street. He was just leaving a\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you notice what house it was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. It was Mrs. Beaumont\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVilliers! Think what you are saying; there must be some mistake. How\r\ncould Crashaw be in Mrs. Beaumont\xe2\x80\x99s house at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\nmorning? Surely, surely, you must have been dreaming, Villiers; you\r\nwere always rather fanciful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I was wide awake enough. Even if I had been dreaming as you say,\r\nwhat I saw would have roused me effectually.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you saw? What did you see? Was there anything strange about\r\nCrashaw? But I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it; it is impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if you like I will tell you what I saw, or if you please, what I\r\nthink I saw, and you can judge for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Villiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe noise and clamour of the street had died away, though now and then\r\nthe sound of shouting still came from the distance, and the dull,\r\nleaden silence seemed like the quiet after an earthquake or a storm.\r\nVilliers turned from the window and began speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was at a house near Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park last night, and when I came away\r\nthe fancy took me to walk home instead of taking a hansom. It was a\r\nclear pleasant night enough, and after a few minutes I had the streets\r\npretty much to myself. It\xe2\x80\x99s a curious thing, Austin, to be alone in\r\nLondon at night, the gas-lamps stretching away in perspective, and the\r\ndead silence, and then perhaps the rush and clatter of a hansom on the\r\nstones, and the fire starting up under the horse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs. I walked\r\nalong pretty briskly, for I was feeling a little tired of being out in\r\nthe night, and as the clocks were striking two I turned down Ashley\r\nStreet, which, you know, is on my way. It was quieter than ever there,\r\nand the lamps were fewer; altogether, it looked as dark and gloomy as a\r\nforest in winter. I had done about half the length of the street when I\r\nheard a door closed very softly, and naturally I looked up to see who\r\nwas abroad like myself at such an hour. As it happens, there is a\r\nstreet lamp close to the house in question, and I saw a man standing on\r\nthe step. He had just shut the door and his face was towards me, and I\r\nrecognized Crashaw directly. I never knew him to speak to, but I had\r\noften seen him, and I am positive that I was not mistaken in my man. I\r\nlooked into his face for a moment, and then\xe2\x80\x94I will confess the truth\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nset off at a good run, and kept it up till I was within my own door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Because it made my blood run cold to see that man\xe2\x80\x99s face. I could\r\nnever have supposed that such an infernal medley of passions could have\r\nglared out of any human eyes; I almost fainted as I looked. I knew I\r\nhad looked into the eyes of a lost soul, Austin, the man\xe2\x80\x99s outward form\r\nremained, but all hell was within it. Furious lust, and hate that was\r\nlike fire, and the loss of all hope and horror that seemed to shriek\r\naloud to the night, though his teeth were shut; and the utter blackness\r\nof despair. I am sure that he did not see me; he saw nothing that you\r\nor I can see, but what he saw I hope we never shall. I do not know when\r\nhe died; I suppose in an hour, or perhaps two, but when I passed down\r\nAshley Street and heard the closing door, that man no longer belonged\r\nto this world; it was a devil\xe2\x80\x99s face I looked upon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of silence in the room when Villiers ceased\r\nspeaking. The light was failing, and all the tumult of an hour ago was\r\nquite hushed. Austin had bent his head at the close of the story, and\r\nhis hand covered his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can it mean?\xe2\x80\x9d he said at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows, Austin, who knows? It\xe2\x80\x99s a black business, but I think we\r\nhad better keep it to ourselves, for the present at any rate. I will\r\nsee if I cannot learn anything about that house through private\r\nchannels of information, and if I do light upon anything I will let you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nTHE ENCOUNTER IN SOHO\r\n\r\n\r\nThree weeks later Austin received a note from Villiers, asking him to\r\ncall either that afternoon or the next. He chose the nearer date, and\r\nfound Villiers sitting as usual by the window, apparently lost in\r\nmeditation on the drowsy traffic of the street. There was a bamboo\r\ntable by his side, a fantastic thing, enriched with gilding and queer\r\npainted scenes, and on it lay a little pile of papers arranged and\r\ndocketed as neatly as anything in Mr. Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Villiers, have you made any discoveries in the last three\r\nweeks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think so; I have here one or two memoranda which struck me as\r\nsingular, and there is a statement to which I shall call your\r\nattention.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd these documents relate to Mrs. Beaumont? It was really Crashaw\r\nwhom you saw that night standing on the doorstep of the house in Ashley\r\nStreet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that matter my belief remains unchanged, but neither my\r\ninquiries nor their results have any special relation to Crashaw. But\r\nmy investigations have had a strange issue. I have found out who Mrs.\r\nBeaumont is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is she? In what way do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean that you and I know her better under another name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat name is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert!\xe2\x80\x9d Austin repeated the word, dazed with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mrs. Herbert of Paul Street, Helen Vaughan of earlier adventures\r\nunknown to me. You had reason to recognize the expression of her face;\r\nwhen you go home look at the face in Meyrick\xe2\x80\x99s book of horrors, and you\r\nwill know the sources of your recollection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have proof of this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the best of proof; I have seen Mrs. Beaumont, or shall we say\r\nMrs. Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you see her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHardly in a place where you would expect to see a lady who lives in\r\nAshley Street, Piccadilly. I saw her entering a house in one of the\r\nmeanest and most disreputable streets in Soho. In fact, I had made an\r\nappointment, though not with her, and she was precise to both time and\r\nplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this seems very wonderful, but I cannot call it incredible. You\r\nmust remember, Villiers, that I have seen this woman, in the ordinary\r\nadventure of London society, talking and laughing, and sipping her\r\ncoffee in a commonplace drawing-room with commonplace people. But you\r\nknow what you are saying.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do; I have not allowed myself to be led by surmises or fancies. It\r\nwas with no thought of finding Helen Vaughan that I searched for Mrs.\r\nBeaumont in the dark waters of the life of London, but such has been\r\nthe issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must have been in strange places, Villiers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have been in very strange places. It would have been useless,\r\nyou know, to go to Ashley Street, and ask Mrs. Beaumont to give me a\r\nshort sketch of her previous history. No; assuming, as I had to assume,\r\nthat her record was not of the cleanest, it would be pretty certain\r\nthat at some previous time she must have moved in circles not quite so\r\nrefined as her present ones. If you see mud at the top of a stream, you\r\nmay be sure that it was once at the bottom. I went to the bottom. I\r\nhave always been fond of diving into Queer Street for my amusement, and\r\nI found my knowledge of that locality and its inhabitants very useful.\r\nIt is, perhaps, needless to say that my friends had never heard the\r\nname of Beaumont, and as I had never seen the lady, and was quite\r\nunable to describe her, I had to set to work in an indirect way. The\r\npeople there know me; I have been able to do some of them a service now\r\nand again, so they made no difficulty about giving their information;\r\nthey were aware I had no communication direct or indirect with Scotland\r\nYard. I had to cast out a good many lines, though, before I got what I\r\nwanted, and when I landed the fish I did not for a moment suppose it\r\nwas my fish. But I listened to what I was told out of a constitutional\r\nliking for useless information, and I found myself in possession of a\r\nvery curious story, though, as I imagined, not the story I was looking\r\nfor. It was to this effect. Some five or six years ago, a woman named\r\nRaymond suddenly made her appearance in the neighbourhood to which I am\r\nreferring. She was described to me as being quite young, probably not\r\nmore than seventeen or eighteen, very handsome, and looking as if she\r\ncame from the country. I should be wrong in saying that she found her\r\nlevel in going to this particular quarter, or associating with these\r\npeople, for from what I was told, I should think the worst den in\r\nLondon far too good for her. The person from whom I got my information,\r\nas you may suppose, no great Puritan, shuddered and grew sick in\r\ntelling me of the nameless infamies which were laid to her charge.\r\nAfter living there for a year, or perhaps a little more, she\r\ndisappeared as suddenly as she came, and they saw nothing of her till\r\nabout the time of the Paul Street case. At first she came to her old\r\nhaunts only occasionally, then more frequently, and finally took up her\r\nabode there as before, and remained for six or eight months. It\xe2\x80\x99s of no\r\nuse my going into details as to the life that woman led; if you want\r\nparticulars you can look at Meyrick\xe2\x80\x99s legacy. Those designs were not\r\ndrawn from his imagination. She again disappeared, and the people of\r\nthe place saw nothing of her till a few months ago. My informant told\r\nme that she had taken some rooms in a house which he pointed out, and\r\nthese rooms she was in the habit of visiting two or three times a week\r\nand always at ten in the morning. I was led to expect that one of these\r\nvisits would be paid on a certain day about a week ago, and I\r\naccordingly managed to be on the look-out in company with my cicerone\r\nat a quarter to ten, and the hour and the lady came with equal\r\npunctuality. My friend and I were standing under an archway, a little\r\nway back from the street, but she saw us, and gave me a glance that I\r\nshall be long in forgetting. That look was quite enough for me; I knew\r\nMiss Raymond to be Mrs. Herbert; as for Mrs. Beaumont she had quite\r\ngone out of my head. She went into the house, and I watched it till\r\nfour o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when she came out, and then I followed her. It was a long\r\nchase, and I had to be very careful to keep a long way in the\r\nbackground, and yet not lose sight of the woman. She took me down to\r\nthe Strand, and then to Westminster, and then up St. James\xe2\x80\x99s Street,\r\nand along Piccadilly. I felt queerish when I saw her turn up Ashley\r\nStreet; the thought that Mrs. Herbert was Mrs. Beaumont came into my\r\nmind, but it seemed too impossible to be true. I waited at the corner,\r\nkeeping my eye on her all the time, and I took particular care to note\r\nthe house at which she stopped. It was the house with the gay curtains,\r\nthe home of flowers, the house out of which Crashaw came the night he\r\nhanged himself in his garden. I was just going away with my discovery,\r\nwhen I saw an empty carriage come round and draw up in front of the\r\nhouse, and I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Herbert was going out for\r\na drive, and I was right. There, as it happened, I met a man I know,\r\nand we stood talking together a little distance from the carriage-way,\r\nto which I had my back. We had not been there for ten minutes when my\r\nfriend took off his hat, and I glanced round and saw the lady I had\r\nbeen following all day. \xe2\x80\x98Who is that?\xe2\x80\x99 I said, and his answer was \xe2\x80\x98Mrs.\r\nBeaumont; lives in Ashley Street.\xe2\x80\x99 Of course there could be no doubt\r\nafter that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether she saw me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she did.\r\nI went home at once, and, on consideration, I thought that I had a\r\nsufficiently good case with which to go to Clarke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy to Clarke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I am sure that Clarke is in possession of facts about this\r\nwoman, facts of which I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers leaned back in his chair and looked reflectively at Austin\r\nfor a moment before he answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy idea was that Clarke and I should call on Mrs. Beaumont.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would never go into such a house as that? No, no, Villiers, you\r\ncannot do it. Besides, consider; what result...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you soon. But I was going to say that my information does\r\nnot end here; it has been completed in an extraordinary manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at this neat little packet of manuscript; it is paginated, you\r\nsee, and I have indulged in the civil coquetry of a ribbon of red tape.\r\nIt has almost a legal air, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Run your eye over it, Austin. It\r\nis an account of the entertainment Mrs. Beaumont provided for her\r\nchoicer guests. The man who wrote this escaped with his life, but I do\r\nnot think he will live many years. The doctors tell him he must have\r\nsustained some severe shock to the nerves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin took the manuscript, but never read it. Opening the neat pages\r\nat haphazard his eye was caught by a word and a phrase that followed\r\nit; and, sick at heart, with white lips and a cold sweat pouring like\r\nwater from his temples, he flung the paper down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake it away, Villiers, never speak of this again. Are you made of\r\nstone, man? Why, the dread and horror of death itself, the thoughts of\r\nthe man who stands in the keen morning air on the black platform,\r\nbound, the bell tolling in his ears, and waits for the harsh rattle of\r\nthe bolt, are as nothing compared to this. I will not read it; I should\r\nnever sleep again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. I can fancy what you saw. Yes; it is horrible enough; but\r\nafter all, it is an old story, an old mystery played in our day, and in\r\ndim London streets instead of amidst the vineyards and the olive\r\ngardens. We know what happened to those who chanced to meet the Great\r\nGod Pan, and those who are wise know that all symbols are symbols of\r\nsomething, not of nothing. It was, indeed, an exquisite symbol beneath\r\nwhich men long ago veiled their knowledge of the most awful, most\r\nsecret forces which lie at the heart of all things; forces before which\r\nthe souls of men must wither and die and blacken, as their bodies\r\nblacken under the electric current. Such forces cannot be named, cannot\r\nbe spoken, cannot be imagined except under a veil and a symbol, a\r\nsymbol to the most of us appearing a quaint, poetic fancy, to some a\r\nfoolish tale. But you and I, at all events, have known something of the\r\nterror that may dwell in the secret place of life, manifested under\r\nhuman flesh; that which is without form taking to itself a form. Oh,\r\nAustin, how can it be? How is it that the very sunlight does not turn\r\nto blackness before this thing, the hard earth melt and boil beneath\r\nsuch a burden?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVilliers was pacing up and down the room, and the beads of sweat stood\r\nout on his forehead. Austin sat silent for a while, but Villiers saw\r\nhim make a sign upon his breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say again, Villiers, you will surely never enter such a house as\r\nthat? You would never pass out alive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Austin, I shall go out alive\xe2\x80\x94I, and Clarke with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? You cannot, you would not dare...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a moment. The air was very pleasant and fresh this morning; there\r\nwas a breeze blowing, even through this dull street, and I thought I\r\nwould take a walk. Piccadilly stretched before me a clear, bright\r\nvista, and the sun flashed on the carriages and on the quivering leaves\r\nin the park. It was a joyous morning, and men and women looked at the\r\nsky and smiled as they went about their work or their pleasure, and the\r\nwind blew as blithely as upon the meadows and the scented gorse. But\r\nsomehow or other I got out of the bustle and the gaiety, and found\r\nmyself walking slowly along a quiet, dull street, where there seemed to\r\nbe no sunshine and no air, and where the few foot-passengers loitered\r\nas they walked, and hung indecisively about corners and archways. I\r\nwalked along, hardly knowing where I was going or what I did there, but\r\nfeeling impelled, as one sometimes is, to explore still further, with a\r\nvague idea of reaching some unknown goal. Thus I forged up the street,\r\nnoting the small traffic of the milk-shop, and wondering at the\r\nincongruous medley of penny pipes, black tobacco, sweets, newspapers,\r\nand comic songs which here and there jostled one another in the short\r\ncompass of a single window. I think it was a cold shudder that suddenly\r\npassed through me that first told me that I had found what I wanted. I\r\nlooked up from the pavement and stopped before a dusty shop, above\r\nwhich the lettering had faded, where the red bricks of two hundred\r\nyears ago had grimed to black; where the windows had gathered to\r\nthemselves the dust of winters innumerable. I saw what I required; but\r\nI think it was five minutes before I had steadied myself and could walk\r\nin and ask for it in a cool voice and with a calm face. I think there\r\nmust even then have been a tremor in my words, for the old man who came\r\nout of the back parlour, and fumbled slowly amongst his goods, looked\r\noddly at me as he tied the parcel. I paid what he asked, and stood\r\nleaning by the counter, with a strange reluctance to take up my goods\r\nand go. I asked about the business, and learnt that trade was bad and\r\nthe profits cut down sadly; but then the street was not what it was\r\nbefore traffic had been diverted, but that was done forty years ago,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98just before my father died,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. I got away at last, and walked\r\nalong sharply; it was a dismal street indeed, and I was glad to return\r\nto the bustle and the noise. Would you like to see my purchase?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin said nothing, but nodded his head slightly; he still looked\r\nwhite and sick. Villiers pulled out a drawer in the bamboo table, and\r\nshowed Austin a long coil of cord, hard and new; and at one end was a\r\nrunning noose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the best hempen cord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Villiers, \xe2\x80\x9cjust as it used to be\r\nmade for the old trade, the man told me. Not an inch of jute from end\r\nto end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAustin set his teeth hard, and stared at Villiers, growing whiter as he\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would not do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would not have blood\r\non your hands. My God!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, with sudden vehemence, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\ncannot mean this, Villiers, that you will make yourself a hangman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. I shall offer a choice, and leave Helen Vaughan alone with this\r\ncord in a locked room for fifteen minutes. If when we go in it is not\r\ndone, I shall call the nearest policeman. That is all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go now. I cannot stay here any longer; I cannot bear this.\r\nGood-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-night, Austin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door shut, but in a moment it was open again, and Austin stood,\r\nwhite and ghastly, in the entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was forgetting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I too have something to tell. I have\r\nreceived a letter from Dr. Harding of Buenos Ayres. He says that he\r\nattended Meyrick for three weeks before his death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does he say what carried him off in the prime of life? It was not\r\nfever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was not fever. According to the doctor, it was an utter\r\ncollapse of the whole system, probably caused by some severe shock. But\r\nhe states that the patient would tell him nothing, and that he was\r\nconsequently at some disadvantage in treating the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Dr. Harding ends his letter by saying: \xe2\x80\x98I think this is all the\r\ninformation I can give you about your poor friend. He had not been long\r\nin Buenos Ayres, and knew scarcely any one, with the exception of a\r\nperson who did not bear the best of characters, and has since left\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nMrs. Vaughan.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nTHE FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Amongst the papers of the well-known physician, Dr. Robert Matheson,\r\nof Ashley Street, Piccadilly, who died suddenly, of apoplectic seizure,\r\nat the beginning of 1892, a leaf of manuscript paper was found, covered\r\nwith pencil jottings. These notes were in Latin, much abbreviated, and\r\nhad evidently been made in great haste. The MS. was only deciphered\r\nwith difficulty, and some words have up to the present time evaded all\r\nthe efforts of the expert employed. The date, \xe2\x80\x9cXXV Jul. 1888,\xe2\x80\x9d is\r\nwritten on the right-hand corner of the MS. The following is a\r\ntranslation of Dr. Matheson\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether science would benefit by these brief notes if they could be\r\npublished, I do not know, but rather doubt. But certainly I shall never\r\ntake the responsibility of publishing or divulging one word of what is\r\nhere written, not only on account of my oath given freely to those two\r\npersons who were present, but also because the details are too\r\nabominable. It is probably that, upon mature consideration, and after\r\nweighting the good and evil, I shall one day destroy this paper, or at\r\nleast leave it under seal to my friend D., trusting in his discretion,\r\nto use it or to burn it, as he may think fit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs was befitting, I did all that my knowledge suggested to make sure\r\nthat I was suffering under no delusion. At first astounded, I could\r\nhardly think, but in a minute\xe2\x80\x99s time I was sure that my pulse was\r\nsteady and regular, and that I was in my real and true senses. I then\r\nfixed my eyes quietly on what was before me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough horror and revolting nausea rose up within me, and an odour of\r\ncorruption choked my breath, I remained firm. I was then privileged or\r\naccursed, I dare not say which, to see that which was on the bed, lying\r\nthere black like ink, transformed before my eyes. The skin, and the\r\nflesh, and the muscles, and the bones, and the firm structure of the\r\nhuman body that I had thought to be unchangeable, and permanent as\r\nadamant, began to melt and dissolve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that the body may be separated into its elements by external\r\nagencies, but I should have refused to believe what I saw. For here\r\nthere was some internal force, of which I knew nothing, that caused\r\ndissolution and change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere too was all the work by which man had been made repeated before\r\nmy eyes. I saw the form waver from sex to sex, dividing itself from\r\nitself, and then again reunited. Then I saw the body descend to the\r\nbeasts whence it ascended, and that which was on the heights go down to\r\nthe depths, even to the abyss of all being. The principle of life,\r\nwhich makes organism, always remained, while the outward form changed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe light within the room had turned to blackness, not the darkness of\r\nnight, in which objects are seen dimly, for I could see clearly and\r\nwithout difficulty. But it was the negation of light; objects were\r\npresented to my eyes, if I may say so, without any medium, in such a\r\nmanner that if there had been a prism in the room I should have seen no\r\ncolours represented in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI watched, and at last I saw nothing but a substance as jelly. Then\r\nthe ladder was ascended again... [_here the_ MS. _is illegible_] ...for\r\none instance I saw a Form, shaped in dimness before me, which I will\r\nnot farther describe. But the symbol of this form may be seen in\r\nancient sculptures, and in paintings which survived beneath the lava,\r\ntoo foul to be spoken of... as a horrible and unspeakable shape,\r\nneither man nor beast, was changed into human form, there came finally\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI who saw all this, not without great horror and loathing of soul,\r\nhere write my name, declaring all that I have set on this paper to be\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cROBERT MATHESON, Med. Dr.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n...Such, Raymond, is the story of what I know and what I have seen. The\r\nburden of it was too heavy for me to bear alone, and yet I could tell\r\nit to none but you. Villiers, who was with me at the last, knows\r\nnothing of that awful secret of the wood, of how what we both saw die,\r\nlay upon the smooth, sweet turf amidst the summer flowers, half in sun\r\nand half in shadow, and holding the girl Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s hand, called and\r\nsummoned those companions, and shaped in solid form, upon the earth we\r\ntread upon, the horror which we can but hint at, which we can only name\r\nunder a figure. I would not tell Villiers of this, nor of that\r\nresemblance, which struck me as with a blow upon my heart, when I saw\r\nthe portrait, which filled the cup of terror at the end. What this can\r\nmean I dare not guess. I know that what I saw perish was not Mary, and\r\nyet in the last agony Mary\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looked into mine. Whether there can\r\nbe any one who can show the last link in this chain of awful mystery, I\r\ndo not know, but if there be any one who can do this, you, Raymond, are\r\nthe man. And if you know the secret, it rests with you to tell it or\r\nnot, as you please.\r\n\r\nI am writing this letter to you immediately on my getting back to town.\r\nI have been in the country for the last few days; perhaps you may be\r\nable to guess in which part. While the horror and wonder of London was\r\nat its height\xe2\x80\x94for \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Beaumont,\xe2\x80\x9d as I have told you, was well known\r\nin society\xe2\x80\x94I wrote to my friend Dr. Phillips, giving some brief\r\noutline, or rather hint, of what happened, and asking him to tell me\r\nthe name of the village where the events he had related to me occurred.\r\nHe gave me the name, as he said with the less hesitation, because\r\nRachel\xe2\x80\x99s father and mother were dead, and the rest of the family had\r\ngone to a relative in the State of Washington six months before. The\r\nparents, he said, had undoubtedly died of grief and horror caused by\r\nthe terrible death of their daughter, and by what had gone before that\r\ndeath. On the evening of the day which I received Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 letter I\r\nwas at Caermaen, and standing beneath the mouldering Roman walls, white\r\nwith the winters of seventeen hundred years, I looked over the meadow\r\nwhere once had stood the older temple of the \xe2\x80\x9cGod of the Deeps,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nsaw a house gleaming in the sunlight. It was the house where Helen had\r\nlived. I stayed at Caermaen for several days. The people of the place,\r\nI found, knew little and had guessed less. Those whom I spoke to on the\r\nmatter seemed surprised that an antiquarian (as I professed myself to\r\nbe) should trouble about a village tragedy, of which they gave a very\r\ncommonplace version, and, as you may imagine, I told nothing of what I\r\nknew. Most of my time was spent in the great wood that rises just above\r\nthe village and climbs the hillside, and goes down to the river in the\r\nvalley; such another long lovely valley, Raymond, as that on which we\r\nlooked one summer night, walking to and fro before your house. For many\r\nan hour I strayed through the maze of the forest, turning now to right\r\nand now to left, pacing slowly down long alleys of undergrowth, shadowy\r\nand chill, even under the midday sun, and halting beneath great oaks;\r\nlying on the short turf of a clearing where the faint sweet scent of\r\nwild roses came to me on the wind and mixed with the heavy perfume of\r\nthe elder, whose mingled odour is like the odour of the room of the\r\ndead, a vapour of incense and corruption. I stood at the edges of the\r\nwood, gazing at all the pomp and procession of the foxgloves towering\r\namidst the bracken and shining red in the broad sunshine, and beyond\r\nthem into deep thickets of close undergrowth where springs boil up from\r\nthe rock and nourish the water-weeds, dank and evil. But in all my\r\nwanderings I avoided one part of the wood; it was not till yesterday\r\nthat I climbed to the summit of the hill, and stood upon the ancient\r\nRoman road that threads the highest ridge of the wood. Here they had\r\nwalked, Helen and Rachel, along this quiet causeway, upon the pavement\r\nof green turf, shut in on either side by high banks of red earth, and\r\ntall hedges of shining beech, and here I followed in their steps,\r\nlooking out, now and again, through partings in the boughs, and seeing\r\non one side the sweep of the wood stretching far to right and left, and\r\nsinking into the broad level, and beyond, the yellow sea, and the land\r\nover the sea. On the other side was the valley and the river and hill\r\nfollowing hill as wave on wave, and wood and meadow, and cornfield, and\r\nwhite houses gleaming, and a great wall of mountain, and far blue peaks\r\nin the north. And so at last I came to the place. The track went up a\r\ngentle slope, and widened out into an open space with a wall of thick\r\nundergrowth around it, and then, narrowing again, passed on into the\r\ndistance and the faint blue mist of summer heat. And into this pleasant\r\nsummer glade Rachel passed a girl, and left it, who shall say what? I\r\ndid not stay long there.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a small town near Caermaen there is a museum, containing for the\r\nmost part Roman remains which have been found in the neighbourhood at\r\nvarious times. On the day after my arrival in Caermaen I walked over to\r\nthe town in question, and took the opportunity of inspecting the\r\nmuseum. After I had seen most of the sculptured stones, the coffins,\r\nrings, coins, and fragments of tessellated pavement which the place\r\ncontains, I was shown a small square pillar of white stone, which had\r\nbeen recently discovered in the wood of which I have been speaking,\r\nand, as I found on inquiry, in that open space where the Roman road\r\nbroadens out. On one side of the pillar was an inscription, of which I\r\ntook a note. Some of the letters have been defaced, but I do not think\r\nthere can be any doubt as to those which I supply. The inscription is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nDEVOMNODENT_i_\r\nFLA_v_IVSSENILISPOSSV_it_\r\nPROPTERNVP_tias_\r\n_qua_SVIDITSVBVMB_ra_\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the great god Nodens (the god of the Great Deep or Abyss) Flavius\r\nSenilis has erected this pillar on account of the marriage which he saw\r\nbeneath the shade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe custodian of the museum informed me that local antiquaries were\r\nmuch puzzled, not by the inscription, or by any difficulty in\r\ntranslating it, but as to the circumstance or rite to which allusion is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n...And now, my dear Clarke, as to what you tell me about Helen Vaughan,\r\nwhom you say you saw die under circumstances of the utmost and almost\r\nincredible horror. I was interested in your account, but a good deal,\r\nnay all, of what you told me I knew already. I can understand the\r\nstrange likeness you remarked in both the portrait and in the actual\r\nface; you have seen Helen\xe2\x80\x99s mother. You remember that still summer\r\nnight so many years ago, when I talked to you of the world beyond the\r\nshadows, and of the god Pan. You remember Mary. She was the mother of\r\nHelen Vaughan, who was born nine months after that night.\r\n\r\nMary never recovered her reason. She lay, as you saw her, all the while\r\nupon her bed, and a few days after the child was born she died. I fancy\r\nthat just at the last she knew me; I was standing by the bed, and the\r\nold look came into her eyes for a second, and then she shuddered and\r\ngroaned and died. It was an ill work I did that night when you were\r\npresent; I broke open the door of the house of life, without knowing or\r\ncaring what might pass forth or enter in. I recollect your telling me\r\nat the time, sharply enough, and rightly too, in one sense, that I had\r\nruined the reason of a human being by a foolish experiment, based on an\r\nabsurd theory. You did well to blame me, but my theory was not all\r\nabsurdity. What I said Mary would see she saw, but I forgot that no\r\nhuman eyes can look on such a sight with impunity. And I forgot, as I\r\nhave just said, that when the house of life is thus thrown open, there\r\nmay enter in that for which we have no name, and human flesh may become\r\nthe veil of a horror one dare not express. I played with energies which\r\nI did not understand, you have seen the ending of it. Helen Vaughan did\r\nwell to bind the cord about her neck and die, though the death was\r\nhorrible. The blackened face, the hideous form upon the bed, changing\r\nand melting before your eyes from woman to man, from man to beast, and\r\nfrom beast to worse than beast, all the strange horror that you\r\nwitness, surprises me but little. What you say the doctor whom you sent\r\nfor saw and shuddered at I noticed long ago; I knew what I had done the\r\nmoment the child was born, and when it was scarcely five years old I\r\nsurprised it, not once or twice but several times with a playmate, you\r\nmay guess of what kind. It was for me a constant, an incarnate horror,\r\nand after a few years I felt I could bear it no more, and I sent Helen\r\nVaughan away. You know now what frightened the boy in the wood. The\r\nrest of the strange story, and all else that you tell me, as discovered\r\nby your friend, I have contrived to learn from time to time, almost to\r\nthe last chapter. And now Helen is with her companions...\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\xe2\x80\x94Helen Vaughan was born on August 5th, 1865, at the Red House,\r\nBreconshire, and died on July 25th, 1888, in her house in a street off\r\nPiccadilly, called Ashley Street in the story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GREAT GOD PAN ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
