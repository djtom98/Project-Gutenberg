That made it an emotion the more\r\nlively\xe2\x80\x94though singularly rare and always, even then, with opportunity\r\nstill very much smothered\xe2\x80\x94to see any one come in whom she knew outside,\r\nas she called it, any one who could add anything to the meanness of her\r\nfunction. Her function was to sit there with two young men\xe2\x80\x94the other\r\ntelegraphist and the counter-clerk; to mind the \xe2\x80\x9csounder,\xe2\x80\x9d which was\r\nalways going, to dole out stamps and postal-orders, weigh letters,\r\nanswer stupid questions, give difficult change and, more than anything\r\nelse, count words as numberless as the sands of the sea, the words of\r\nthe telegrams thrust, from morning to night, through the gap left in\r\nthe high lattice, across the encumbered shelf that her forearm ached\r\nwith rubbing. This transparent screen fenced out or fenced in,\r\naccording to the side of the narrow counter on which the human lot was\r\ncast, the duskiest corner of a shop pervaded not a little, in winter,\r\nby the poison of perpetual gas, and at all times by the presence of\r\nhams, cheese, dried fish, soap, varnish, paraffin and other solids and\r\nfluids that she came to know perfectly by their smells without\r\nconsenting to know them by their names.\r\n\r\nThe barrier that divided the little post-and-telegraph-office from the\r\ngrocery was a frail structure of wood and wire; but the social, the\r\nprofessional separation was a gulf that fortune, by a stroke quite\r\nremarkable, had spared her the necessity of contributing at all\r\npublicly to bridge. When Mr. Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s young men stepped over from\r\nbehind the other counter to change a five-pound note\xe2\x80\x94and Mr. Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsituation, with the cream of the \xe2\x80\x9cCourt Guide\xe2\x80\x9d and the dearest\r\nfurnished apartments, Simpkin\xe2\x80\x99s, Ladle\xe2\x80\x99s, Thrupp\xe2\x80\x99s, just round the\r\ncorner, was so select that his place was quite pervaded by the crisp\r\nrustle of these emblems\xe2\x80\x94she pushed out the sovereigns as if the\r\napplicant were no more to her than one of the momentary, the\r\npractically featureless, appearances in the great procession; and this\r\nperhaps all the more from the very fact of the connexion (only\r\nrecognised outside indeed) to which she had lent herself with\r\nridiculous inconsequence. She recognised the others the less because\r\nshe had at last so unreservedly, so irredeemably, recognised Mr. Mudge.\r\nHowever that might be, she was a little ashamed of having to admit to\r\nherself that Mr. Mudge\xe2\x80\x99s removal to a higher sphere\xe2\x80\x94to a more\r\ncommanding position, that is, though to a much lower\r\nneighbourhood\xe2\x80\x94would have been described still better as a luxury than\r\nas the mere simplification, the corrected awkwardness, that she\r\ncontented herself with calling it. He had at any rate ceased to be all\r\nday long in her eyes, and this left something a little fresh for them\r\nto rest on of a Sunday. During the three months of his happy survival\r\nat Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s after her consent to their engagement she had often asked\r\nherself what it was marriage would be able to add to a familiarity that\r\nseemed already to have scraped the platter so clean. Opposite there,\r\nbehind the counter of which his superior stature, his whiter apron, his\r\nmore clustering curls and more present, too present, _h_\xe2\x80\x99s had been for\r\na couple of years the principal ornament, he had moved to and fro\r\nbefore her as on the small sanded floor of their contracted future. She\r\nwas conscious now of the improvement of not having to take her present\r\nand her future at once. They were about as much as she could manage\r\nwhen taken separate.\r\n\r\nShe had, none the less, to give her mind steadily to what Mr. Mudge had\r\nagain written her about, the idea of her applying for a transfer to an\r\noffice quite similar\xe2\x80\x94she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t yet hope for a place in a\r\nbigger\xe2\x80\x94under the very roof where he was foreman, so that, dangled\r\nbefore her every minute of the day, he should see her, as he called it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chourly,\xe2\x80\x9d and in a part, the far N.W. district, where, with her mother,\r\nshe would save on their two rooms alone nearly three shillings. It\r\nwould be far from dazzling to exchange Mayfair for Chalk Farm, and it\r\nwore upon her much that he could never drop a subject; still, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwear as things _had_ worn, the worries of the early times of their\r\ngreat misery, her own, her mother\xe2\x80\x99s and her elder sister\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94the last of\r\nwhom had succumbed to all but absolute want when, as conscious and\r\nincredulous ladies, suddenly bereft, betrayed, overwhelmed, they had\r\nslipped faster and faster down the steep slope at the bottom of which\r\nshe alone had rebounded. Her mother had never rebounded any more at the\r\nbottom than on the way; had only rumbled and grumbled down and down,\r\nmaking, in respect of caps, topics and \xe2\x80\x9chabits,\xe2\x80\x9d no effort\r\nwhatever\xe2\x80\x94which simply meant smelling much of the time of whiskey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was always rather quiet at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s while the contingent from\r\nLadle\xe2\x80\x99s and Thrupp\xe2\x80\x99s and all the other great places were at luncheon,\r\nor, as the young men used vulgarly to say, while the animals were\r\nfeeding. She had forty minutes in advance of this to go home for her\r\nown dinner; and when she came back and one of the young men took his\r\nturn there was often half an hour during which she could pull out a bit\r\nof work or a book\xe2\x80\x94a book from the place where she borrowed novels, very\r\ngreasy, in fine print and all about fine folks, at a ha\xe2\x80\x99penny a day.\r\nThis sacred pause was one of the numerous ways in which the\r\nestablishment kept its finger on the pulse of fashion and fell into the\r\nrhythm of the larger life. It had something to do, one day, with the\r\nparticular flare of importance of an arriving customer, a lady whose\r\nmeals were apparently irregular, yet whom she was destined, she\r\nafterwards found, not to forget. The girl was _blas\xc3\xa9e;_ nothing could\r\nbelong more, as she perfectly knew, to the intense publicity of her\r\nprofession; but she had a whimsical mind and wonderful nerves; she was\r\nsubject, in short, to sudden flickers of antipathy and sympathy, red\r\ngleams in the grey, fitful needs to notice and to \xe2\x80\x9ccare,\xe2\x80\x9d odd caprices\r\nof curiosity. She had a friend who had invented a new career for\r\nwomen\xe2\x80\x94that of being in and out of people\xe2\x80\x99s houses to look after the\r\nflowers. Mrs. Jordan had a manner of her own of sounding this allusion;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe flowers,\xe2\x80\x9d on her lips, were, in fantastic places, in happy homes,\r\nas usual as the coals or the daily papers. She took charge of them, at\r\nany rate, in all the rooms, at so much a month, and people were quickly\r\nfinding out what it was to make over this strange burden of the\r\npampered to the widow of a clergyman. The widow, on her side, dilating\r\non the initiations thus opened up to her, had been splendid to her\r\nyoung friend, over the way she was made free of the greatest houses\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nway, especially when she did the dinner-tables, set out so often for\r\ntwenty, she felt that a single step more would transform her whole\r\nsocial position. On its being asked of her then if she circulated only\r\nin a sort of tropical solitude, with the upper servants for picturesque\r\nnatives, and on her having to assent to this glance at her limitations,\r\nshe had found a reply to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s invidious question. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve no\r\nimagination, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that was because a door more than half open to\r\nthe higher life couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be called anything but a thin partition. Mrs.\r\nJordan\xe2\x80\x99s imagination quite did away with the thickness.\r\n\r\nOur young lady had not taken up the charge, had dealt with it\r\ngood-humouredly, just because she knew so well what to think of it. It\r\nwas at once one of her most cherished complaints and most secret\r\nsupports that people didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand her, and it was accordingly a\r\nmatter of indifference to her that Mrs. Jordan shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; even though\r\nMrs. Jordan, handed down from their early twilight of gentility and\r\nalso the victim of reverses, was the only member of her circle in whom\r\nshe recognised an equal. She was perfectly aware that her imaginative\r\nlife was the life in which she spent most of her time; and she would\r\nhave been ready, had it been at all worth while, to contend that, since\r\nher outward occupation didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill it, it must be strong indeed.\r\nCombinations of flowers and green-stuff, forsooth! What _she_ could\r\nhandle freely, she said to herself, was combinations of men and women.\r\nThe only weakness in her faculty came from the positive abundance of\r\nher contact with the human herd; this was so constant, it had so the\r\neffect of cheapening her privilege, that there were long stretches in\r\nwhich inspiration, divination and interest quite dropped. The great\r\nthing was the flashes, the quick revivals, absolute accidents all, and\r\nneither to be counted on nor to be resisted. Some one had only\r\nsometimes to put in a penny for a stamp and the whole thing was upon\r\nher. She was so absurdly constructed that these were literally the\r\nmoments that made up\xe2\x80\x94made up for the long stiffness of sitting there in\r\nthe stocks, made up for the cunning hostility of Mr. Buckton and the\r\nimportunate sympathy of the counter-clerk, made up for the daily deadly\r\nflourishy letter from Mr. Mudge, made up even for the most haunting of\r\nher worries, the rage at moments of not knowing how her mother did \xe2\x80\x9cget\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had surrendered herself moreover of late to a certain expansion of\r\nher consciousness; something that seemed perhaps vulgarly accounted for\r\nby the fact that, as the blast of the season roared louder and the\r\nwaves of fashion tossed their spray further over the counter, there\r\nwere more impressions to be gathered and really\xe2\x80\x94for it came to\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94more life to be led. Definite at any rate it was that by the time\r\nMay was well started the kind of company she kept at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s had begun\r\nto strike her as a reason\xe2\x80\x94a reason she might almost put forward for a\r\npolicy of procrastination. It sounded silly, of course, as yet, to\r\nplead such a motive, especially as the fascination of the place was\r\nafter all a sort of torment. But she liked her torment; it was a\r\ntorment she should miss at Chalk Farm. She was ingenious and uncandid,\r\ntherefore, about leaving the breadth of London a little longer between\r\nherself and that austerity. If she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t quite the courage in short to\r\nsay to Mr. Mudge that her actual chance for a play of mind was worth\r\nany week the three shillings he desired to help her to save, she yet\r\nsaw something happen in the course of the month that in her heart of\r\nhearts at least answered the subtle question. This was connected\r\nprecisely with the appearance of the memorable lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe pushed in three bescribbled forms which the girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand was quick\r\nto appropriate, Mr. Buckton having so frequent a perverse instinct for\r\ncatching first any eye that promised the sort of entertainment with\r\nwhich she had her peculiar affinity. The amusements of captives are\r\nfull of a desperate contrivance, and one of our young friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99pennyworths had been the charming tale of _Picciola_. It was of\r\ncourse the law of the place that they were never to take no notice, as\r\nMr. Buckton said, whom they served; but this also never prevented,\r\ncertainly on the same gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s own part, what he was fond of\r\ndescribing as the underhand game. Both her companions, for that matter,\r\nmade no secret of the number of favourites they had among the ladies;\r\nsweet familiarities in spite of which she had repeatedly caught each of\r\nthem in stupidities and mistakes, confusions of identity and lapses of\r\nobservation that never failed to remind her how the cleverness of men\r\nends where the cleverness of women begins. \xe2\x80\x9cMarguerite, Regent Street.\r\nTry on at six. All Spanish lace. Pearls. The full length.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the\r\nfirst; it had no signature. \xe2\x80\x9cLady Agnes Orme, Hyde Park Place.\r\nImpossible to-night, dining Haddon. Opera to-morrow, promised Fritz,\r\nbut could do play Wednesday. Will try Haddon for Savoy, and anything in\r\nthe world you like, if you can get Gussy. Sunday Montenero. Sit Mason\r\nMonday, Tuesday. Marguerite awful. Cissy.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the second. The\r\nthird, the girl noted when she took it, was on a foreign form:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverard, H\xc3\xb4tel Brighton, Paris. Only understand and believe. 22nd to\r\n26th, and certainly 8th and 9th. Perhaps others. Come. Mary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMary was very handsome, the handsomest woman, she felt in a moment, she\r\nhad ever seen\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps it was only Cissy. Perhaps it was both, for\r\nshe had seen stranger things than that\xe2\x80\x94ladies wiring to different\r\npersons under different names. She had seen all sorts of things and\r\npieced together all sorts of mysteries. There had once been one\xe2\x80\x94not\r\nlong before\xe2\x80\x94who, without winking, sent off five over five different\r\nsignatures. Perhaps these represented five different friends who had\r\nasked her\xe2\x80\x94all women, just as perhaps now Mary and Cissy, or one or\r\nother of them, were wiring by deputy. Sometimes she put in too much\xe2\x80\x94too\r\nmuch of her own sense; sometimes she put in too little; and in either\r\ncase this often came round to her afterwards, for she had an\r\nextraordinary way of keeping clues. When she noticed she noticed; that\r\nwas what it came to. There were days and days, there were weeks\r\nsometimes, of vacancy. This arose often from Mr. Buckton\xe2\x80\x99s devilish and\r\nsuccessful subterfuges for keeping her at the sounder whenever it\r\nlooked as if anything might arouse; the sounder, which it was equally\r\nhis business to mind, being the innermost cell of captivity, a cage\r\nwithin the cage, fenced oft from the rest by a frame of ground glass.\r\nThe counter-clerk would have played into her hands; but the\r\ncounter-clerk was really reduced to idiocy by the effect of his passion\r\nfor her. She flattered herself moreover, nobly, that with the\r\nunpleasant conspicuity of this passion she would never have consented\r\nto be obliged to him. The most she would ever do would be always to\r\nshove off on him whenever she could the registration of letters, a job\r\nshe happened particularly to loathe. After the long stupors, at all\r\nevents, there almost always suddenly would come a sharp taste of\r\nsomething; it was in her mouth before she knew it; it was in her mouth\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nTo Cissy, to Mary, whichever it was, she found her curiosity going out\r\nwith a rush, a mute effusion that floated back to her, like a returning\r\ntide, the living colour and splendour of the beautiful head, the light\r\nof eyes that seemed to reflect such utterly other things than the mean\r\nthings actually before them; and, above all, the high curt\r\nconsideration of a manner that even at bad moments was a magnificent\r\nhabit and of the very essence of the innumerable things\xe2\x80\x94her beauty, her\r\nbirth, her father and mother, her cousins and all her ancestors\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nits possessor couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have got rid of even had she wished. How did our\r\nobscure little public servant know that for the lady of the telegrams\r\nthis was a bad moment? How did she guess all sorts of impossible\r\nthings, such as, almost on the very spot, the presence of drama at a\r\ncritical stage and the nature of the tie with the gentleman at the\r\nH\xc3\xb4tel Brighton? More than ever before it floated to her through the\r\nbars of the cage that this at last was the high reality, the bristling\r\ntruth that she had hitherto only patched up and eked out\xe2\x80\x94one of the\r\ncreatures, in fine, in whom all the conditions for happiness actually\r\nmet, and who, in the air they made, bloomed with an unwitting\r\ninsolence. What came home to the girl was the way the insolence was\r\ntempered by something that was equally a part of the distinguished\r\nlife, the custom of a flowerlike bend to the less fortunate\xe2\x80\x94a dropped\r\nfragrance, a mere quick breath, but which in fact pervaded and\r\nlingered. The apparition was very young, but certainly married, and our\r\nfatigued friend had a sufficient store of mythological comparison to\r\nrecognise the port of Juno. Marguerite might be \xe2\x80\x9cawful,\xe2\x80\x9d but she knew\r\nhow to dress a goddess.\r\n\r\nPearls and Spanish lace\xe2\x80\x94she herself, with assurance, could see them,\r\nand the \xe2\x80\x9cfull length\xe2\x80\x9d too, and also red velvet bows, which, disposed on\r\nthe lace in a particular manner (she could have placed them with the\r\nturn of a hand) were of course to adorn the front of a black brocade\r\nthat would be like a dress in a picture. However, neither Marguerite\r\nnor Lady Agnes nor Haddon nor Fritz nor Gussy was what the wearer of\r\nthis garment had really come in for. She had come in for Everard\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nthat was doubtless not his true name either. If our young lady had\r\nnever taken such jumps before it was simply that she had never before\r\nbeen so affected. She went all the way. Mary and Cissy had been round\r\ntogether, in their single superb person, to see him\xe2\x80\x94he must live round\r\nthe corner; they had found that, in consequence of something they had\r\ncome, precisely, to make up for or to have another scene about, he had\r\ngone off\xe2\x80\x94gone off just on purpose to make them feel it; on which they\r\nhad come together to Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s as to the nearest place; where they had\r\nput in the three forms partly in order not to put in the one alone. The\r\ntwo others in a manner, covered it, muffled it, passed it off. Oh yes,\r\nshe went all the way, and this was a specimen of how she often went.\r\nShe would know the hand again any time. It was as handsome and as\r\neverything else as the woman herself. The woman herself had, on\r\nlearning his flight, pushed past Everard\xe2\x80\x99s servant and into his room;\r\nshe had written her missive at his table and with his pen. All this,\r\nevery inch of it, came in the waft that she blew through and left\r\nbehind her, the influence that, as I have said, lingered. And among the\r\nthings the girl was sure of, happily, was that she should see her\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe saw her in fact, and only ten days later; but this time not alone,\r\nand that was exactly a part of the luck of it. Not unaware\xe2\x80\x94as how could\r\nher observation have left her so?\xe2\x80\x94of the possibilities through which it\r\ncould range, our young lady had ever since had in her mind a dozen\r\nconflicting theories about Everard\xe2\x80\x99s type; as to which, the instant\r\nthey came into the place, she felt the point settled with a thump that\r\nseemed somehow addressed straight to her heart. That organ literally\r\nbeat faster at the approach of the gentleman who was this time with\r\nCissy, and who, as seen from within the cage, became on the spot the\r\nhappiest of the happy circumstances with which her mind had invested\r\nthe friend of Fritz and Gussy. He was a very happy circumstance indeed\r\nas, with his cigarette in his lips and his broken familiar talk caught\r\nby his companion, he put down the half-dozen telegrams it would take\r\nthem together several minutes to dispatch. And here it occurred, oddly\r\nenough, that if, shortly before the girl\xe2\x80\x99s interest in his companion\r\nhad sharpened her sense for the messages then transmitted, her\r\nimmediate vision of himself had the effect, while she counted his\r\nseventy words, of preventing intelligibility. _His_ words were mere\r\nnumbers, they told her nothing whatever; and after he had gone she was\r\nin possession of no name, of no address, of no meaning, of nothing but\r\na vague sweet sound and an immense impression. He had been there but\r\nfive minutes, he had smoked in her face, and, busy with his telegrams,\r\nwith the tapping pencil and the conscious danger, the odious betrayal\r\nthat would come from a mistake, she had had no wandering glances nor\r\nroundabout arts to spare. Yet she had taken him in; she knew\r\neverything; she had made up her mind.\r\n\r\nHe had come back from Paris; everything was re-arranged; the pair were\r\nagain shoulder to shoulder in their high encounter with life, their\r\nlarge and complicated game. The fine soundless pulse of this game was\r\nin the air for our young woman while they remained in the shop. While\r\nthey remained? They remained all day; their presence continued and\r\nabode with her, was in everything she did till nightfall, in the\r\nthousands of other words she counted, she transmitted, in all the\r\nstamps she detached and the letters she weighed and the change she\r\ngave, equally unconscious and unerring in each of these particulars,\r\nand not, as the run on the little office thickened with the afternoon\r\nhours, looking up at a single ugly face in the long sequence, nor\r\nreally hearing the stupid questions that she patiently and perfectly\r\nanswered. All patience was possible now, all questions were stupid\r\nafter his, all faces were ugly. She had been sure she should see the\r\nlady again; and even now she should perhaps, she should probably, see\r\nher often. But for him it was totally different; she should never never\r\nsee him. She wanted it too much. There was a kind of wanting that\r\nhelped\xe2\x80\x94she had arrived, with her rich experience, at that\r\ngeneralisation; and there was another kind that was fatal. It was this\r\ntime the fatal kind; it would prevent.\r\n\r\nWell, she saw him the very next day, and on this second occasion it was\r\nquite different; the sense of every syllable he paid for was fiercely\r\ndistinct; she indeed felt her progressive pencil, dabbing as if with a\r\nquick caress the marks of his own, put life into every stroke. He was\r\nthere a long time\xe2\x80\x94had not brought his forms filled out but worked them\r\noff in a nook on the counter; and there were other people as well\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nchanging pushing cluster, with every one to mind at once and endless\r\nright change to make and information to produce. But she kept hold of\r\nhim throughout; she continued, for herself, in a relation with him as\r\nclose as that in which, behind the hated ground glass, Mr. Buckton\r\nluckily continued with the sounder. This morning everything changed,\r\nbut rather to dreariness; she had to swallow the rebuff to her theory\r\nabout fatal desires, which she did without confusion and indeed with\r\nabsolute levity; yet if it was now flagrant that he did live close at\r\nhand\xe2\x80\x94at Park Chambers\xe2\x80\x94and belonged supremely to the class that wired\r\neverything, even their expensive feelings (so that, as he never wrote,\r\nhis correspondence cost him weekly pounds and pounds, and he might be\r\nin and out five times a day) there was, all the same, involved in the\r\nprospect, and by reason of its positive excess of light, a perverse\r\nmelancholy, a gratuitous misery. This was at once to give it a place in\r\nan order of feelings on which I shall presently touch.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for a month, he was very constant. Cissy, Mary, never\r\nre-appeared with him; he was always either alone or accompanied only by\r\nsome gentleman who was lost in the blaze of his glory. There was\r\nanother sense, however\xe2\x80\x94and indeed there was more than one\xe2\x80\x94in which she\r\nmostly found herself counting in the splendid creature with whom she\r\nhad originally connected him. He addressed this correspondent neither\r\nas Mary nor as Cissy; but the girl was sure of whom it was, in Eaten\r\nSquare, that he was perpetually wiring to\xe2\x80\x94and all so irreproachably!\xe2\x80\x94as\r\nLady Bradeen. Lady Bradeen was Cissy, Lady Bradeen was Mary, Lady\r\nBradeen was the friend of Fritz and of Gussy, the customer of\r\nMarguerite, and the close ally in short (as was ideally right, only the\r\ngirl had not yet found a descriptive term that was) of the most\r\nmagnificent of men. Nothing could equal the frequency and variety of\r\nhis communications to her ladyship but their extraordinary, their\r\nabysmal propriety. It was just the talk\xe2\x80\x94so profuse sometimes that she\r\nwondered what was left for their real meetings\xe2\x80\x94of the very happiest\r\npeople. Their real meetings must have been constant, for half of it was\r\nappointments and allusions, all swimming in a sea of other allusions\r\nstill, tangled in a complexity of questions that gave a wondrous image\r\nof their life. If Lady Bradeen was Juno it was all certainly Olympian.\r\nIf the girl, missing the answers, her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s own outpourings,\r\nvainly reflected that Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s should have been one of the bigger\r\noffices where telegrams arrived as well as departed, there were yet\r\nways in which, on the whole, she pressed the romance closer by reason\r\nof the very quantity of imagination it demanded and consumed. The days\r\nand hours of this new friend, as she came to account him, were at all\r\nevents unrolled, and however much more she might have known she would\r\nstill have wished to go beyond. In fact she did go beyond; she went\r\nquite far enough.\r\n\r\nBut she could none the less, even after a month, scarce have told if\r\nthe gentlemen who came in with him recurred or changed; and this in\r\nspite of the fact that they too were always posting and wiring, smoking\r\nin her face and signing or not signing. The gentlemen who came in with\r\nhim were nothing when he was there. They turned up alone at other\r\ntimes\xe2\x80\x94then only perhaps with a dim richness of reference. He himself,\r\nabsent as well as present, was all. He was very tall, very fair, and\r\nhad, in spite of his thick preoccupations, a good-humour that was\r\nexquisite, particularly as it so often had the effect of keeping him\r\non. He could have reached over anybody, and anybody\xe2\x80\x94no matter who\xe2\x80\x94would\r\nhave let him; but he was so extraordinarily kind that he quite\r\npathetically waited, never waggling things at her out of his turn nor\r\nsaying \xe2\x80\x9cHere!\xe2\x80\x9d with horrid sharpness. He waited for pottering old\r\nladies, for gaping slaveys, for the perpetual Buttonses from Thrupp\xe2\x80\x99s;\r\nand the thing in all this that she would have liked most unspeakably to\r\nput to the test was the possibility of her having for him a personal\r\nidentity that might in a particular way appeal. There were moments when\r\nhe actually struck her as on her side, as arranging to help, to\r\nsupport, to spare her.\r\n\r\nBut such was the singular spirit of our young friend that she could\r\nremind herself with a pang that when people had awfully good\r\nmanners\xe2\x80\x94people of that class,\xe2\x80\x94you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell. These manners were for\r\neverybody, and it might be drearily unavailing for any poor particular\r\nbody to be overworked and unusual. What he did take for granted was all\r\nsorts of facility; and his high pleasantness, his relighting of\r\ncigarettes while he waited, his unconscious bestowal of opportunities,\r\nof boons, of blessings, were all a part of his splendid security, the\r\ninstinct that told him there was nothing such an existence as his could\r\never lose by. He was somehow all at once very bright and very grave,\r\nvery young and immensely complete; and whatever he was at any moment it\r\nwas always as much as all the rest the mere bloom of his beatitude. He\r\nwas sometimes Everard, as he had been at the H\xc3\xb4tel Brighton, and he was\r\nsometimes Captain Everard. He was sometimes Philip with his surname and\r\nsometimes Philip without it. In some directions he was merely Phil, in\r\nothers he was merely Captain. There were relations in which he was none\r\nof these things, but a quite different person\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe Count.\xe2\x80\x9d There were\r\nseveral friends for whom he was William. There were several for whom,\r\nin allusion perhaps to his complexion, he was \xe2\x80\x9cthe Pink \xe2\x80\x98Un.\xe2\x80\x9d Once,\r\nonce only by good luck, he had, coinciding comically, quite\r\nmiraculously, with another person also near to her, been \xe2\x80\x9cMudge.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes,\r\nwhatever he was, it was a part of his happiness\xe2\x80\x94whatever he was and\r\nprobably whatever he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And his happiness was a part\xe2\x80\x94it became so\r\nlittle by little\xe2\x80\x94of something that, almost from the first of her being\r\nat Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, had been deeply with the girl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was neither more nor less than the queer extension of her\r\nexperience, the double life that, in the cage, she grew at last to\r\nlead. As the weeks went on there she lived more and more into the world\r\nof whiffs and glimpses, she found her divinations work faster and\r\nstretch further. It was a prodigious view as the pressure heightened, a\r\npanorama fed with facts and figures, flushed with a torrent of colour\r\nand accompanied with wondrous world-music. What it mainly came to at\r\nthis period was a picture of how London could amuse itself; and that,\r\nwith the running commentary of a witness so exclusively a witness,\r\nturned for the most part to a hardening of the heart. The nose of this\r\nobserver was brushed by the bouquet, yet she could never really pluck\r\neven a daisy. What could still remain fresh in her daily grind was the\r\nimmense disparity, the difference and contrast, from class to class, of\r\nevery instant and every motion. There were times when all the wires in\r\nthe country seemed to start from the little hole-and-corner where she\r\nplied for a livelihood, and where, in the shuffle of feet, the flutter\r\nof \xe2\x80\x9cforms,\xe2\x80\x9d the straying of stamps and the ring of change over the\r\ncounter, the people she had fallen into the habit of remembering and\r\nfitting together with others, and of having her theories and\r\ninterpretations of, kept up before her their long procession and\r\nrotation. What twisted the knife in her vitals was the way the\r\nprofligate rich scattered about them, in extravagant chatter over their\r\nextravagant pleasures and sins, an amount of money that would have held\r\nthe stricken household of her frightened childhood, her poor pinched\r\nmother and tormented father and lost brother and starved sister,\r\ntogether for a lifetime. During her first weeks she had often gasped at\r\nthe sums people were willing to pay for the stuff they transmitted\xe2\x80\x94the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmuch love\xe2\x80\x9ds, the \xe2\x80\x9cawful\xe2\x80\x9d regrets, the compliments and wonderments and\r\nvain vague gestures that cost the price of a new pair of boots. She had\r\nhad a way then of glancing at the people\xe2\x80\x99s faces, but she had early\r\nlearnt that if you became a telegraphist you soon ceased to be\r\nastonished. Her eye for types amounted nevertheless to genius, and\r\nthere were those she liked and those she hated, her feeling for the\r\nlatter of which grew to a positive possession, an instinct of\r\nobservation and detection. There were the brazen women, as she called\r\nthem, of the higher and the lower fashion, whose squanderings and\r\ngraspings, whose struggles and secrets and love-affairs and lies, she\r\ntracked and stored up against them till she had at moments, in private,\r\na triumphant vicious feeling of mastery and ease, a sense of carrying\r\ntheir silly guilty secrets in her pocket, her small retentive brain,\r\nand thereby knowing so much more about them than they suspected or\r\nwould care to think. There were those she would have liked to betray,\r\nto trip up, to bring down with words altered and fatal; and all through\r\na personal hostility provoked by the lightest signs, by their accidents\r\nof tone and manner, by the particular kind of relation she always\r\nhappened instantly to feel.\r\n\r\nThere were impulses of various kinds, alternately soft and severe, to\r\nwhich she was constitutionally accessible and which were determined by\r\nthe smallest accidents. She was rigid in general on the article of\r\nmaking the public itself affix its stamps, and found a special\r\nenjoyment in dealing to that end with some of the ladies who were too\r\ngrand to touch them. She had thus a play of refinement and subtlety\r\ngreater, she flattered herself, than any of which she could be made the\r\nsubject; and though most people were too stupid to be conscious of this\r\nit brought her endless small consolations and revenges. She recognised\r\nquite as much those of her sex whom she would have liked to help, to\r\nwarn, to rescue, to see more of; and that alternative as well operated\r\nexactly through the hazard of personal sympathy, her vision for silver\r\nthreads and moonbeams and her gift for keeping the clues and finding\r\nher way in the tangle. The moonbeams and silver threads presented at\r\nmoments all the vision of what poor _she_ might have made of happiness.\r\nBlurred and blank as the whole thing often inevitably, or mercifully,\r\nbecame, she could still, through crevices and crannies, be stupefied,\r\nespecially by what, in spite of all seasoning, touched the sorest place\r\nin her consciousness, the revelation of the golden shower flying about\r\nwithout a gleam of gold for herself. It remained prodigious to the end,\r\nthe money her fine friends were able to spend to get still more, or\r\neven to complain to fine friends of their own that they were in want.\r\nThe pleasures they proposed were equalled only by those they declined,\r\nand they made their appointments often so expensively that she was left\r\nwondering at the nature of the delights to which the mere approaches\r\nwere so paved with shillings. She quivered on occasion into the\r\nperception of this and that one whom she would on the chance have just\r\nsimply liked to _be_. Her conceit, her baffled vanity, was possibly\r\nmonstrous; she certainly often threw herself into a defiant conviction\r\nthat she would have done the whole thing much better. But her greatest\r\ncomfort, mostly, was her comparative vision of the men; by whom I mean\r\nthe unmistakeable gentlemen, for she had no interest in the spurious or\r\nthe shabby and no mercy at all for the poor. She could have found a\r\nsixpence, outside, for an appearance of want; but her fancy, in some\r\ndirections so alert, had never a throb of response for any sign of the\r\nsordid. The men she did track, moreover, she tracked mainly in one\r\nrelation, the relation as to which the cage convinced her, she\r\nbelieved, more than anything else could have done, that it was quite\r\nthe most diffused.\r\n\r\nShe found her ladies, in short, almost always in communication with her\r\ngentlemen, and her gentlemen with her ladies, and she read into the\r\nimmensity of their intercourse stories and meanings without end.\r\nIncontestably she grew to think that the men cut the best figure; and\r\nin this particular, as in many others, she arrived at a philosophy of\r\nher own, all made up of her private notations and cynicisms. It was a\r\nstriking part of the business, for example, that it was much more the\r\nwomen, on the whole, who were after the men than the men who were after\r\nthe women: it was literally visible that the general attitude of the\r\none sex was that of the object pursued and defensive, apologetic and\r\nattenuating, while the light of her own nature helped her more or less\r\nto conclude as to the attitude of the other. Perhaps she herself a\r\nlittle even fell into the custom of pursuit in occasionally deviating\r\nonly for gentlemen from her high rigour about the stamps. She had early\r\nin the day made up her mind, in fine, that they had the best manners;\r\nand if there were none of them she noticed when Captain Everard was\r\nthere, there were plenty she could place and trace and name at other\r\ntimes, plenty who, with their way of being \xe2\x80\x9cnice\xe2\x80\x9d to her, and of\r\nhandling, as if their pockets were private tills loose mixed masses of\r\nsilver and gold, were such pleasant appearances that she could envy\r\nthem without dislike. _They_ never had to give change\xe2\x80\x94they only had to\r\nget it. They ranged through every suggestion, every shade of fortune,\r\nwhich evidently included indeed lots of bad luck as well as of good,\r\ndeclining even toward Mr. Mudge and his bland firm thrift, and\r\nascending, in wild signals and rocket-flights, almost to within hail of\r\nher highest standard. So from month to month she went on with them all,\r\nthrough a thousand ups and downs and a thousand pangs and\r\nindifferences. What virtually happened was that in the shuffling herd\r\nthat passed before her by far the greater part only passed\xe2\x80\x94a proportion\r\nbut just appreciable stayed. Most of the elements swam straight away,\r\nlost themselves in the bottomless common, and by so doing really kept\r\nthe page clear. On the clearness therefore what she did retain stood\r\nsharply out; she nipped and caught it, turned it over and interwove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe met Mrs. Jordan when she could, and learned from her more and more\r\nhow the great people, under her gentle shake and after going through\r\neverything with the mere shops, were waking up to the gain of putting\r\ninto the hands of a person of real refinement the question that the\r\nshop-people spoke of so vulgarly as that of the floral decorations. The\r\nregular dealers in these decorations were all very well; but there was\r\na peculiar magic in the play of taste of a lady who had only to\r\nremember, through whatever intervening dusk, all her own little tables,\r\nlittle bowls and little jars and little other arrangements, and the\r\nwonderful thing she had made of the garden of the vicarage. This small\r\ndomain, which her young friend had never seen, bloomed in Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndiscourse like a new Eden, and she converted the past into a bank of\r\nviolets by the tone in which she said \xe2\x80\x9cOf course you always knew my one\r\npassion!\xe2\x80\x9d She obviously met now, at any rate, a big contemporary need,\r\nmeasured what it was rapidly becoming for people to feel they could\r\ntrust her without a tremor. It brought them a peace that\xe2\x80\x94during the\r\nquarter of an hour before dinner in especial\xe2\x80\x94was worth more to them\r\nthan mere payment could express. Mere payment, none the less, was\r\ntolerably prompt; she engaged by the month, taking over the whole\r\nthing; and there was an evening on which, in respect to our heroine,\r\nshe at last returned to the charge. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s growing and growing, and I\r\nsee that I must really divide the work. One wants an associate\xe2\x80\x94of one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nown kind, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? You know the look they want it all to\r\nhave?\xe2\x80\x94of having come, not from a florist, but from one of themselves.\r\nWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure _you_ could give it\xe2\x80\x94because you _are_ one. Then we\r\n_should_ win. Therefore just come in with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd leave the P.O.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet the P.O. simply bring you your letters. It would bring you lots,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99d see: orders, after a bit, by the score.\xe2\x80\x9d It was on this, in due\r\ncourse, that the great advantage again came up: \xe2\x80\x9cOne seems to live\r\nagain with one\xe2\x80\x99s own people.\xe2\x80\x9d It had taken some little time (after\r\ntheir having parted company in the tempest of their troubles and then,\r\nin the glimmering dawn, finally sighted each other again) for each to\r\nadmit that the other was, in her private circle, her only equal, but\r\nthe admission came, when it did come, with an honest groan; and since\r\nequality was named, each found much personal profit in exaggerating the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s original grandeur. Mrs. Jordan was ten years the older, but her\r\nyoung friend was struck with the smaller difference this now made: it\r\nhad counted otherwise at the time when, much more as a friend of her\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s, the bereaved lady, without a penny of provision and with\r\nstopgaps, like their own, all gone, had, across the sordid landing on\r\nwhich the opposite doors of the pair of scared miseries opened and to\r\nwhich they were bewilderedly bolted, borrowed coals and umbrellas that\r\nwere repaid in potatoes and postage-stamps. It had been a questionable\r\nhelp, at that time, to ladies submerged, floundering, panting, swimming\r\nfor their lives, that they were ladies; but such an advantage could\r\ncome up again in proportion as others vanished, and it had grown very\r\ngreat by the time it was the only ghost of one they possessed. They had\r\nliterally watched it take to itself a portion of the substance of each\r\nthat had departed; and it became prodigious now, when they could talk\r\nof it together, when they could look back at it across a desert of\r\naccepted derogation, and when, above all, they could together work up a\r\ncredulity about it that neither could otherwise work up. Nothing was\r\nreally so marked as that they felt the need to cultivate this legend\r\nmuch more after having found their feet and stayed their stomachs in\r\nthe ultimate obscure than they had done in the upper air of mere\r\nfrequent shocks. The thing they could now oftenest say to each other\r\nwas that they knew what they meant; and the sentiment with which, all\r\nround, they knew it was known had well-nigh amounted to a promise not\r\nagain to fall apart.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan was at present fairly dazzling on the subject of the way\r\nthat, in the practice of her fairy art, as she called it, she more than\r\npeeped in\xe2\x80\x94she penetrated. There was not a house of the great kind\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nit was of course only a question of those, real homes of luxury\xe2\x80\x94in\r\nwhich she was not, at the rate such people now had things, all over the\r\nplace. The girl felt before the picture the cold breath of\r\ndisinheritance as much as she had ever felt it in the cage; she knew\r\nmoreover how much she betrayed this, for the experience of poverty had\r\nbegun, in her life, too early, and her ignorance of the requirements of\r\nhomes of luxury had grown, with other active knowledge, a depth of\r\nsimplification. She had accordingly at first often found that in these\r\ncolloquies she could only pretend she understood. Educated as she had\r\nrapidly been by her chances at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, there were still strange gaps\r\nin her learning\xe2\x80\x94she could never, like Mrs. Jordan, have found her way\r\nabout one of the \xe2\x80\x9chomes.\xe2\x80\x9d Little by little, however, she had caught on,\r\nabove all in the light of what Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s redemption had materially\r\nmade of that lady, giving her, though the years and the struggles had\r\nnaturally not straightened a feature, an almost super-eminent air.\r\nThere were women in and out of Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s who were quite nice and who yet\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t look well; whereas Mrs. Jordan looked well and yet, with her\r\nextraordinarily protrusive teeth, was by no means quite nice. It would\r\nseem, mystifyingly, that it might really come from all the greatness\r\nshe could live with. It was fine to hear her talk so often of dinners\r\nof twenty and of her doing, as she said, exactly as she liked with\r\nthem. She spoke as if, for that matter, she invited the company. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\r\nsimply give me the table\xe2\x80\x94all the rest, all the other effects, come\r\nafterwards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you _do_ see them?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl again asked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan hesitated, and indeed the point had been ambiguous before.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean the guests?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer young friend, cautious about an undue exposure of innocence, was\r\nnot quite sure. \xe2\x80\x9cWell\xe2\x80\x94the people who live there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Ventnor? Mrs. Bubb? Lord Rye? Dear, yes. Why they _like_ one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does one personally _know_ them?\xe2\x80\x9d our young lady went on, since\r\nthat was the way to speak. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean socially, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x94as you\r\nknow _me_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not so nice as you!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jordan charmingly cried. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\n_shall_ see more and more of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh this was the old story. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy almost any day. Of course,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jordan honestly added, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnearly always out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do they want flowers all over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any difference.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jordan was not philosophic;\r\nshe was just evidently determined it _shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t_ make any. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nawfully interested in my ideas, and it\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable they should meet me\r\nover them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer interlocutress was sturdy enough. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you call your ideas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s reply was fine. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were to see me some day with a\r\nthousand tulips you\xe2\x80\x99d discover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA thousand?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the girl gaped at such a revelation of the scale of it;\r\nshe felt for the instant fairly planted out. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, but if in fact they\r\nnever do meet you?\xe2\x80\x9d she none the less pessimistically insisted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever? They _often_ do\xe2\x80\x94and evidently quite on purpose. We have grand\r\nlong talks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something in our young lady that could still stay her from\r\nasking for a personal description of these apparitions; that showed too\r\nstarved a state. But while she considered she took in afresh the whole\r\nof the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s widow. Mrs. Jordan couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help her teeth, and her\r\nsleeves were a distinct rise in the world. A thousand tulips at a\r\nshilling clearly took one further than a thousand words at a penny; and\r\nthe betrothed of Mr. Mudge, in whom the sense of the race for life was\r\nalways acute, found herself wondering, with a twinge of her easy\r\njealousy, if it mightn\xe2\x80\x99t after all then, for _her_ also, be\r\nbetter\xe2\x80\x94better than where she was\xe2\x80\x94to follow some such scent. Where she\r\nwas was where Mr. Buckton\xe2\x80\x99s elbow could freely enter her right side and\r\nthe counter-clerk\xe2\x80\x99s breathing\xe2\x80\x94he had something the matter with his\r\nnose\xe2\x80\x94pervade her left ear. It was something to fill an office under\r\nGovernment, and she knew but too well there were places commoner still\r\nthan Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s; but it needed no great range of taste to bring home to\r\nher the picture of servitude and promiscuity she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t but offer to\r\nthe eye of comparative freedom. She was so boxed up with her young men,\r\nand anything like a margin so absent, that it needed more art than she\r\nshould ever possess to pretend in the least to compass, with any one in\r\nthe nature of an acquaintance\xe2\x80\x94say with Mrs. Jordan herself, flying in,\r\nas it might happen, to wire sympathetically to Mrs. Bubb\xe2\x80\x94an approach to\r\na relation of elegant privacy. She remembered the day when Mrs. Jordan\r\n_had_, in fact, by the greatest chance, come in with fifty-three words\r\nfor Lord Rye and a five-pound note to change. This had been the\r\ndramatic manner of their reunion\xe2\x80\x94their mutual recognition was so great\r\nan event. The girl could at first only see her from the waist up,\r\nbesides making but little of her long telegram to his lordship. It was\r\na strange whirligig that had converted the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s widow into such\r\na specimen of the class that went beyond the sixpence.\r\n\r\nNothing of the occasion, all the more, had ever become dim; least of\r\nall the way that, as her recovered friend looked up from counting, Mrs.\r\nJordan had just blown, in explanation, through her teeth and through\r\nthe bars of the cage: \xe2\x80\x9cI _do_ flowers, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d Our young woman had\r\nalways, with her little finger crooked out, a pretty movement for\r\ncounting; and she had not forgotten the small secret advantage, a\r\nsharpness of triumph it might even have been called, that fell upon her\r\nat this moment and avenged her for the incoherence of the message, an\r\nunintelligible enumeration of numbers, colours, days, hours. The\r\ncorrespondence of people she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know was one thing; but the\r\ncorrespondence of people she did had an aspect of its own for her even\r\nwhen she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. The speech in which Mrs. Jordan had\r\ndefined a position and announced a profession was like a tinkle of\r\nbluebells; but for herself her one idea about flowers was that people\r\nhad them at funerals, and her present sole gleam of light was that\r\nlords probably had them most. When she watched, a minute later, through\r\nthe cage, the swing of her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s departing petticoats, she saw the\r\nsight from the waist down; and when the counter-clerk, after a mere\r\nmale glance, remarked, with an intention unmistakeably low, \xe2\x80\x9cHandsome\r\nwoman!\xe2\x80\x9d she had for him the finest of her chills: \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the widow of a\r\nbishop.\xe2\x80\x9d She always felt, with the counter-clerk, that it was\r\nimpossible sufficiently to put it on; for what she wished to express to\r\nhim was the maximum of her contempt, and that element in her nature was\r\nconfusedly stored. \xe2\x80\x9cA bishop\xe2\x80\x9d was putting it on, but the\r\ncounter-clerk\xe2\x80\x99s approaches were vile. The night, after this, when, in\r\nthe fulness of time, Mrs. Jordan mentioned the grand long talks, the\r\ngirl at last brought out: \xe2\x80\x9cShould _I_ see them?\xe2\x80\x94I mean if I _were_ to\r\ngive up everything for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan at this became most arch. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d send you to all the\r\nbachelors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur young lady could be reminded by such a remark that she usually\r\nstruck her friend as pretty. \xe2\x80\x9cDo _they_ have their flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOceans. And they\xe2\x80\x99re the most particular.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh it was a wonderful world.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should see Lord Rye\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and his letters. He writes me pages on pages\xe2\x80\x94with the most\r\nadorable little drawings and plans. You should see his diagrams!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl had in course of time every opportunity to inspect these\r\ndocuments, and they a little disappointed her; but in the mean while\r\nthere had been more talk, and it had led to her saying, as if her\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of a life of elegance were not quite definite:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I see every one at _my_ place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLots of swells. They flock. They live, you know, all round, and the\r\nplace is filled with all the smart people, all the fast people, those\r\nwhose names are in the papers\xe2\x80\x94mamma has still The _Morning Post_\xe2\x80\x94and\r\nwho come up for the season.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan took this in with complete intelligence. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I dare\r\nsay it\xe2\x80\x99s some of your people that _I_ do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer companion assented, but discriminated. \xe2\x80\x9cI doubt if you \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99 them as\r\nmuch as I! Their affairs, their appointments and arrangements, their\r\nlittle games and secrets and vices\xe2\x80\x94those things all pass before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was a picture that could make a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s widow not\r\nimperceptibly gasp; it was in intention moreover something of a retort\r\nto the thousand tulips. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir vices? Have they got vices?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur young critic even more overtly stared then with a touch of contempt\r\nin her amusement: \xe2\x80\x9cHaven\xe2\x80\x99t you found _that_ out?\xe2\x80\x9d The homes of luxury\r\nthen hadn\xe2\x80\x99t so much to give. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ find out everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan, at bottom a very meek person, was visibly struck. \xe2\x80\x9cI see.\r\nYou do \xe2\x80\x98have\xe2\x80\x99 them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I don\xe2\x80\x99t care! Much good it does me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan after an instant recovered her superiority. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x94it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlead to much.\xe2\x80\x9d Her own initiations so clearly did. Still\xe2\x80\x94after all; and\r\nshe was not jealous: \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a charm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn seeing them?\xe2\x80\x9d At this the girl suddenly let herself go. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate\r\nthem. There\xe2\x80\x99s that charm!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan gaped again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe _real_ \xe2\x80\x98smarts\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that what you call Mrs. Bubb? Yes\xe2\x80\x94it comes to me; I\xe2\x80\x99ve had Mrs.\r\nBubb. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she has been in herself, but there are things her\r\nmaid has brought. Well, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and the young person from Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nrecalling these things and summing them up, seemed suddenly to have\r\nmuch to say. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t say it, however; she checked it; she only\r\nbrought out: \xe2\x80\x9cHer maid, who\xe2\x80\x99s horrid\xe2\x80\x94_she_ must have her!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she\r\nwent on with indifference: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re _too_ real! They\xe2\x80\x99re selfish\r\nbrutes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan, turning it over, adopted at last the plan of treating it\r\nwith a smile. She wished to be liberal. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, of course, they do lay\r\nit out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey bore me to death,\xe2\x80\x9d her companion pursued with slightly more\r\ntemperance.\r\n\r\nBut this was going too far. \xe2\x80\x9cAh that\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99ve no sympathy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl gave an ironic laugh, only retorting that nobody could have\r\nany who had to count all day all the words in the dictionary; a\r\ncontention Mrs. Jordan quite granted, the more that she shuddered at\r\nthe notion of ever failing of the very gift to which she owed the\r\nvogue\xe2\x80\x94the rage she might call it\xe2\x80\x94that had caught her up. Without\r\nsympathy\xe2\x80\x94or without imagination, for it came back again to that\xe2\x80\x94how\r\nshould she get, for big dinners, down the middle and toward the far\r\ncorners at all? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the combinations, which were easily managed:\r\nthe strain was over the ineffable simplicities, those that the\r\nbachelors above all, and Lord Rye perhaps most of any, threw off\xe2\x80\x94just\r\nblew off like cigarette-puffs\xe2\x80\x94such sketches of. The betrothed of Mr.\r\nMudge at all events accepted the explanation, which had the effect, as\r\nalmost any turn of their talk was now apt to have, of bringing her\r\nround to the terrific question of that gentleman. She was tormented\r\nwith the desire to get out of Mrs. Jordan, on this subject, what she\r\nwas sure was at the back of Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s head; and to get it out of\r\nher, queerly enough, if only to vent a certain irritation at it. She\r\nknew that what her friend would already have risked if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\ntimid and tortuous was: \xe2\x80\x9cGive him up\xe2\x80\x94yes, give him up: you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that\r\nwith your sure chances you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do much better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur young woman had a sense that if that view could only be put before\r\nher with a particular sniff for poor Mr. Mudge she should hate it as\r\nmuch as she morally ought. She was conscious of not, as yet, hating it\r\nquite so much as that. But she saw that Mrs. Jordan was conscious of\r\nsomething too, and that there was a degree of confidence she was\r\nwaiting little by little to arrive at. The day came when the girl\r\ncaught a glimpse of what was still wanting to make her friend feel\r\nstrong; which was nothing less than the prospect of being able to\r\nannounce the climax of sundry private dreams. The associate of the\r\naristocracy had personal calculations\xe2\x80\x94matter for brooding and dreaming,\r\neven for peeping out not quite hopelessly from behind the\r\nwindow-curtains of lonely lodgings. If she did the flowers for the\r\nbachelors, in short, didn\xe2\x80\x99t she expect that to have consequences very\r\ndifferent from such an outlook at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s as she had pronounced wholly\r\ndesperate? There seemed in very truth something auspicious in the\r\nmixture of bachelors and flowers, though, when looked hard in the eye,\r\nMrs. Jordan was not quite prepared to say she had expected a positive\r\nproposal from Lord Rye to pop out of it. Our young woman arrived at\r\nlast, none the less, at a definite vision of what was in her mind. This\r\nwas a vivid foreknowledge that the betrothed of Mr. Mudge would, unless\r\nconciliated in advance by a successful rescue, almost hate her on the\r\nday she should break a particular piece of news. How could that\r\nunfortunate otherwise endure to hear of what, under the protection of\r\nLady Ventnor, was after all so possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, since irritation sometimes relieved her, the betrothed of\r\nMr. Mudge found herself indebted to that admirer for amounts of it\r\nperfectly proportioned to her fidelity. She always walked with him on\r\nSundays, usually in the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, and quite often, once or twice a\r\nmonth he took her, in the Strand or thereabouts, to see a piece that\r\nwas having a run. The productions he always preferred were the really\r\ngood ones\xe2\x80\x94Shakespeare, Thompson or some funny American thing; which, as\r\nit also happened that she hated vulgar plays, gave him ground for what\r\nwas almost the fondest of his approaches, the theory that their tastes\r\nwere, blissfully, just the same. He was for ever reminding her of that,\r\nrejoicing over it and being affectionate and wise about it. There were\r\ntimes when she wondered how in the world she could \xe2\x80\x9cput up with\xe2\x80\x9d him,\r\nhow she could put up with any man so smugly unconscious of the\r\nimmensity of her difference. It was just for this difference that, if\r\nshe was to be liked at all, she wanted to be liked, and if that was not\r\nthe source of Mr. Mudge\xe2\x80\x99s admiration, she asked herself what on earth\r\n_could_ be? She was not different only at one point, she was different\r\nall round; unless perhaps indeed in being practically human, which her\r\nmind just barely recognised that he also was. She would have made\r\ntremendous concessions in other quarters: there was no limit for\r\ninstance to those she would have made to Captain Everard; but what I\r\nhave named was the most she was prepared to do for Mr. Mudge. It was\r\nbecause _he_ was different that, in the oddest way, she liked as well\r\nas deplored him; which was after all a proof that the disparity, should\r\nthey frankly recognise it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be fatal. She felt\r\nthat, oleaginous\xe2\x80\x94too oleaginous\xe2\x80\x94as he was, he was somehow comparatively\r\nprimitive: she had once, during the portion of his time at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat had overlapped her own, seen him collar a drunken soldier, a big\r\nviolent man who, having come in with a mate to get a postal-order\r\ncashed, had made a grab at the money before his friend could reach it\r\nand had so determined, among the hams and cheeses and the lodgers from\r\nThrupp\xe2\x80\x99s, immediate and alarming reprisals, a scene of scandal and\r\nconsternation. Mr. Buckton and the counter-clerk had crouched within\r\nthe cage, but Mr. Mudge had, with a very quiet but very quick step\r\nround the counter, an air of masterful authority she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t soon\r\nforget, triumphantly interposed in the scrimmage, parted the combatants\r\nand shaken the delinquent in his skin. She had been proud of him at\r\nthat moment, and had felt that if their affair had not already been\r\nsettled the neatness of his execution would have left her without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nTheir affair had been settled by other things: by the evident sincerity\r\nof his passion and by the sense that his high white apron resembled a\r\nfront of many floors. It had gone a great way with her that he would\r\nbuild up a business to his chin, which he carried quite in the air.\r\nThis could only be a question of time; he would have all Piccadilly in\r\nthe pen behind his ear. That was a merit in itself for a girl who had\r\nknown what she had known. There were hours at which she even found him\r\ngood-looking, though, frankly there could be no crown for her effort to\r\nimagine on the part of the tailor or the barber some such treatment of\r\nhis appearance as would make him resemble even remotely a man of the\r\nworld. His very beauty was the beauty of a grocer, and the finest\r\nfuture would offer it none too much room consistently to develop. She\r\nhad engaged herself in short to the perfection of a type, and almost\r\nanything square and smooth and whole had its weight for a person still\r\nconscious herself of being a mere bruised fragment of wreckage. But it\r\ncontributed hugely at present to carry on the two parallel lines of her\r\nexperience in the cage and her experience out of it. After keeping\r\nquiet for some time about this opposition she suddenly\xe2\x80\x94one Sunday\r\nafternoon on a penny chair in the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park\xe2\x80\x94broke, for him,\r\ncapriciously, bewilderingly, into an intimation of what it came to. He\r\nhad naturally pressed more and more on the point of her again placing\r\nherself where he could see her hourly, and for her to recognise that\r\nshe had as yet given him no sane reason for delay he had small need to\r\ndescribe himself as unable to make out what she was up to. As if, with\r\nher absurd bad reasons, she could have begun to tell him! Sometimes she\r\nthought it would be amusing to let him have them full in the face, for\r\nshe felt she should die of him unless she once in a while stupefied\r\nhim; and sometimes she thought it would be disgusting and perhaps even\r\nfatal. She liked him, however, to think her silly, for that gave her\r\nthe margin which at the best she would always require; and the only\r\ndifficulty about this was that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t enough imagination to oblige\r\nher. It produced none the less something of the desired effect\xe2\x80\x94to leave\r\nhim simply wondering why, over the matter of their reunion, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyield to his arguments. Then at last, simply as if by accident and out\r\nof mere boredom on a day that was rather flat, she preposterously\r\nproduced her own. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, wait a bit. Where I am I still see things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd she talked to him even worse, if possible, than she had talked to\r\nJordan.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, to her own stupefaction, she caught that he was\r\ntrying to take it as she meant it and that he was neither astonished\r\nnor angry. Oh the British tradesman\xe2\x80\x94this gave her an idea of his\r\nresources! Mr. Mudge would be angry only with a person who, like the\r\ndrunken soldier in the shop, should have an unfavourable effect on\r\nbusiness. He seemed positively to enter, for the time and without the\r\nfaintest flash of irony or ripple of laughter, into the whimsical\r\ngrounds of her enjoyment of Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s custom, and instantly to be\r\ncasting up whatever it might, as Mrs. Jordan had said, lead to. What he\r\nhad in mind was not of course what Mrs. Jordan had had: it was\r\nobviously not a source of speculation with him that his sweetheart\r\nmight pick up a husband. She could see perfectly that this was not for\r\na moment even what he supposed she herself dreamed of. What she had\r\ndone was simply to give his sensibility another push into the dim vast\r\nof trade. In that direction it was all alert, and she had whisked\r\nbefore it the mild fragrance of a \xe2\x80\x9cconnexion.\xe2\x80\x9d That was the most he\r\ncould see in any account of her keeping in, on whatever roundabout\r\nlines, with the gentry; and when, getting to the bottom of this, she\r\nquickly proceeded to show him the kind of eye she turned on such people\r\nand to give him a sketch of what that eye discovered, she reduced him\r\nto the particular prostration in which he could still be amusing to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the most awful wretches, I assure you\xe2\x80\x94the lot all about\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why do you want to stay among them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear man, just because they _are_. It makes me hate them so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHate them? I thought you liked them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be stupid. What I \xe2\x80\x98like\xe2\x80\x99 is just to loathe them. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve what passes before my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why have you never told me? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention anything before I\r\nleft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got round to it then. It\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of thing you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve at first; you have to look round you a bit and then you\r\nunderstand. You work into it more and more. Besides,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl went on,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthis is the time of the year when the worst lot come up. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsimply packed together in those smart streets. Talk of the numbers of\r\nthe poor! What _I_ can vouch for is the numbers of the rich! There are\r\nnew ones every day, and they seem to get richer and richer. Oh, they do\r\ncome up!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, imitating for her private recreation\xe2\x80\x94she was sure\r\nit wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach Mr. Mudge\xe2\x80\x94the low intonation of the counter-clerk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where do they come from?\xe2\x80\x9d her companion candidly enquired.\r\n\r\nShe had to think a moment; then she found something. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the \xe2\x80\x98spring\r\nmeetings.\xe2\x80\x99 They bet tremendously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they bet enough at Chalk Farm, if that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt _isn\xe2\x80\x99t_ all. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t a millionth part!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied with some\r\nsharpness. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s immense fun\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she would tantalise him. Then as she had\r\nheard Mrs. Jordan say, and as the ladies at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s even sometimes\r\nwired, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite too dreadful!\xe2\x80\x9d She could fully feel how it was Mr.\r\nMudge\xe2\x80\x99s propriety, which was extreme\xe2\x80\x94he had a horror of coarseness and\r\nattended a Wesleyan chapel\xe2\x80\x94that prevented his asking for details. But\r\nshe gave him some of the more innocuous in spite of himself, especially\r\nputting before him how, at Simpkin\xe2\x80\x99s and Ladle\xe2\x80\x99s, they all made the\r\nmoney fly. That was indeed what he liked to hear: the connexion was not\r\ndirect, but one was somehow more in the right place where the money was\r\nflying than where it was simply and meagrely nesting. The air felt that\r\nstir, he had to acknowledge, much less at Chalk Farm than in the\r\ndistrict in which his beloved so oddly enjoyed her footing. She gave\r\nhim, she could see, a restless sense that these might be familiarities\r\nnot to be sacrificed; germs, possibilities, faint foreshowings\xe2\x80\x94heaven\r\nknew what\xe2\x80\x94of the initiation it would prove profitable to have arrived\r\nat when in the fulness of time he should have his own shop in some such\r\nparadise. What really touched him\xe2\x80\x94that was discernible\xe2\x80\x94was that she\r\ncould feed him with so much mere vividness of reminder, keep before\r\nhim, as by the play of a fan, the very wind of the swift bank-notes and\r\nthe charm of the existence of a class that Providence had raised up to\r\nbe the blessing of grocers. He liked to think that the class was there,\r\nthat it was always there, and that she contributed in her slight but\r\nappreciable degree to keep it up to the mark. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nformulated his theory of the matter, but the exuberance of the\r\naristocracy was the advantage of trade, and everything was knit\r\ntogether in a richness of pattern that it was good to follow with one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfinger-tips. It was a comfort to him to be thus assured that there were\r\nno symptoms of a drop. What did the sounder, as she called it, nimbly\r\nworked, do but keep the ball going?\r\n\r\nWhat it came to therefore for Mr. Mudge was that all enjoyments were,\r\nas might be said, inter-related, and that the more people had the more\r\nthey wanted to have. The more flirtations, as he might roughly express\r\nit, the more cheese and pickles. He had even in his own small way been\r\ndimly struck with the link\xc3\xa8d sweetness connecting the tender passion\r\nwith cheap champagne, or perhaps the other way round. What he would\r\nhave liked to say had he been able to work out his thought to the end\r\nwas: \xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see. Lash them up then, lead them on, keep them going:\r\nsome of it can\xe2\x80\x99t help, some time, coming _our_ way.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet he was\r\ntroubled by the suspicion of subtleties on his companion\xe2\x80\x99s part that\r\nspoiled the straight view. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand people\xe2\x80\x99s hating what\r\nthey liked or liking what they hated; above all it hurt him\r\nsomewhere\xe2\x80\x94for he had his private delicacies\xe2\x80\x94to see anything _but_ money\r\nmade out of his betters. To be too enquiring, or in any other way too\r\nfree, at the expense of the gentry was vaguely wrong; the only thing\r\nthat was distinctly right was to be prosperous at any price. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\njust because they were up there aloft that they were lucrative? He\r\nconcluded at any rate by saying to his young friend: \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s improper\r\nfor you to remain at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, then that falls in exactly with the\r\nother reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ve put before you for your removal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImproper?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her smile became a prolonged boldness. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy,\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s no one like you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughed; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t give up my friends. I\xe2\x80\x99m making even more\r\nthan Mrs. Jordan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mudge considered. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much is _she_ making?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh you dear donkey!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and, regardless of all the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Park, she\r\npatted his cheek. This was the sort of moment at which she was\r\nabsolutely tempted to tell him that she liked to be near Park Chambers.\r\nThere was a fascination in the idea of seeing if, on a mention of\r\nCaptain Everard, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do what she thought he might; wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nweigh against the obvious objection the still more obvious advantage.\r\nThe advantage of course could only strike him at the best as rather\r\nfantastic; but it was always to the good to keep hold when you _had_\r\nhold, and such an attitude would also after all involve a high tribute\r\nto her fidelity. Of one thing she absolutely never doubted: Mr. Mudge\r\nbelieved in her with a belief\xe2\x80\x94! She believed in herself too, for that\r\nmatter: if there was a thing in the world no one could charge her with\r\nit was being the kind of low barmaid person who rinsed tumblers and\r\nbandied slang. But she forbore as yet to speak; she had not spoken even\r\nto Mrs. Jordan; and the hush that on her lips surrounded the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname maintained itself as a kind of symbol of the success that, up to\r\nthis time, had attended something or other\xe2\x80\x94she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x94that she humoured herself with calling, without words, her\r\nrelation with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe would have admitted indeed that it consisted of little more than\r\nthe fact that his absences, however frequent and however long, always\r\nended with his turning up again. It was nobody\xe2\x80\x99s business in the world\r\nbut her own if that fact continued to be enough for her. It was of\r\ncourse not enough just in itself; what it had taken on to make it so\r\nwas the extraordinary possession of the elements of his life that\r\nmemory and attention had at last given her. There came a day when this\r\npossession on the girl\xe2\x80\x99s part actually seemed to enjoy between them,\r\nwhile their eyes met, a tacit recognition that was half a joke and half\r\na deep solemnity. He bade her good morning always now; he often quite\r\nraised his hat to her. He passed a remark when there was time or room,\r\nand once she went so far as to say to him that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen him for\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cages.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAges\xe2\x80\x9d was the word she consciously and carefully, though a\r\ntrifle tremulously used; \xe2\x80\x9cages\xe2\x80\x9d was exactly what she meant. To this he\r\nreplied in terms doubtless less anxiously selected, but perhaps on that\r\naccount not the less remarkable, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it been awfully wet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThat was a specimen of their give and take; it fed her fancy that no\r\nform of intercourse so transcendent and distilled had ever been\r\nestablished on earth. Everything, so far as they chose to consider it\r\nso, might mean almost anything. The want of margin in the cage, when he\r\npeeped through the bars, wholly ceased to be appreciable. It was a\r\ndrawback only in superficial commerce. With Captain Everard she had\r\nsimply the margin of the universe. It may be imagined therefore how\r\ntheir unuttered reference to all she knew about him could in this\r\nimmensity play at its ease. Every time he handed in a telegram it was\r\nan addition to her knowledge: what did his constant smile mean to mark\r\nif it didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to mark that? He never came into the place without\r\nsaying to her in this manner: \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, you have me by this time so\r\ncompletely at your mercy that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least matter what I\r\ngive you now. You\xe2\x80\x99ve become a comfort, I assure you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had only two torments; the greatest of which was that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,\r\nnot even once or twice, touch with him on some individual fact. She\r\nwould have given anything to have been able to allude to one of his\r\nfriends by name, to one of his engagements by date, to one of his\r\ndifficulties by the solution. She would have given almost as much for\r\njust the right chance\xe2\x80\x94it would have to be tremendously right\xe2\x80\x94to show\r\nhim in some sharp sweet way that she had perfectly penetrated the\r\ngreatest of these last and now lived with it in a kind of heroism of\r\nsympathy. He was in love with a woman to whom, and to any view of whom,\r\na lady-telegraphist, and especially one who passed a life among hams\r\nand cheeses, was as the sand on the floor; and what her dreams desired\r\nwas the possibility of its somehow coming to him that her own interest\r\nin him could take a pure and noble account of such an infatuation and\r\neven of such an impropriety. As yet, however, she could only rub along\r\nwith the hope that an accident, sooner or later, might give her a lift\r\ntoward popping out with something that would surprise and perhaps even,\r\nsome fine day, assist him. What could people mean moreover\xe2\x80\x94cheaply\r\nsarcastic people\xe2\x80\x94by not feeling all that could be got out of the\r\nweather? _She_ felt it all, and seemed literally to feel it most when\r\nshe went quite wrong, speaking of the stuffy days as cold, of the cold\r\nones as stuffy, and betraying how little she knew, in her cage, of\r\nwhether it was foul or fair. It was for that matter always stuffy at\r\nCocker\xe2\x80\x99s, and she finally settled down to the safe proposition that the\r\noutside element was \xe2\x80\x9cchangeable.\xe2\x80\x9d Anything seemed true that made him so\r\nradiantly assent.\r\n\r\nThis indeed is a small specimen of her cultivation of insidious ways of\r\nmaking things easy for him\xe2\x80\x94ways to which of course she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at\r\nall sure he did real justice. Real justice was not of this world: she\r\nhad had too often to come back to that; yet, strangely, happiness was,\r\nand her traps had to be set for it in a manner to keep them unperceived\r\nby Mr. Buckton and the counter-clerk. The most she could hope for apart\r\nfrom the question, which constantly flickered up and died down, of the\r\ndivine chance of his consciously liking her, would be that, without\r\nanalysing it, he should arrive at a vague sense that Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s was\xe2\x80\x94well,\r\nattractive; easier, smoother, sociably brighter, slightly more\r\npicturesque, in short more propitious in general to his little affairs,\r\nthan any other establishment just thereabouts. She was quite aware that\r\nthey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, in so huddled a hole, particularly quick; but she\r\nfound her account in the slowness\xe2\x80\x94she certainly could bear it if _he_\r\ncould. The great pang was that just thereabouts post-offices were so\r\nawfully thick. She was always seeing him in imagination in other places\r\nand with other girls. But she would defy any other girl to follow him\r\nas she followed. And though they weren\xe2\x80\x99t, for so many reasons, quick at\r\nCocker\xe2\x80\x99s, she could hurry for him when, through an intimation light as\r\nair, she gathered that he was pressed.\r\n\r\nWhen hurry was, better still, impossible, it was because of the\r\npleasantest thing of all, the particular element of their contact\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nwould have called it their friendship\xe2\x80\x94that consisted of an almost\r\nhumorous treatment of the look of some of his words. They would never\r\nperhaps have grown half so intimate if he had not, by the blessing of\r\nheaven, formed some of his letters with a queerness\xe2\x80\x94! It was positive\r\nthat the queerness could scarce have been greater if he had practised\r\nit for the very purpose of bringing their heads together over it as far\r\nas was possible to heads on different sides of a wire fence. It had\r\ntaken her truly but once or twice to master these tricks, but, at the\r\ncost of striking him perhaps as stupid, she could still challenge them\r\nwhen circumstances favoured. The great circumstance that favoured was\r\nthat she sometimes actually believed he knew she only feigned\r\nperplexity. If he knew it therefore he tolerated it; if he tolerated it\r\nhe came back; and if he came back he liked her. This was her seventh\r\nheaven; and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask much of his liking\xe2\x80\x94she only asked of it to\r\nreach the point of his not going away because of her own. He had at\r\ntimes to be away for weeks; he had to lead his life; he had to\r\ntravel\xe2\x80\x94there were places to which he was constantly wiring for \xe2\x80\x9crooms\xe2\x80\x9d:\r\nall this she granted him, forgave him; in fact, in the long run,\r\nliterally blessed and thanked him for. If he had to lead his life, that\r\nprecisely fostered his leading it so much by telegraph: therefore the\r\nbenediction was to come in when he could. That was all she asked\xe2\x80\x94that\r\nhe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wholly deprive her.\r\n\r\nSometimes she almost felt that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have deprived her even had\r\nhe been minded, by reason of the web of revelation that was woven\r\nbetween them. She quite thrilled herself with thinking what, with such\r\na lot of material, a bad girl would do. It would be a scene better than\r\nmany in her ha\xe2\x80\x99penny novels, this going to him in the dusk of evening\r\nat Park Chambers and letting him at last have it. \xe2\x80\x9cI know too much\r\nabout a certain person now not to put it to you\xe2\x80\x94excuse my being so\r\nlurid\xe2\x80\x94that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite worth your while to buy me off. Come, therefore;\r\nbuy me!\xe2\x80\x9d There was a point indeed at which such flights had to drop\r\nagain\xe2\x80\x94the point of an unreadiness to name, when it came to that, the\r\npurchasing medium. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t certainly be anything so gross as money,\r\nand the matter accordingly remained rather vague, all the more that\r\n_she_ was not a bad girl. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for any such reason as might have\r\naggravated a mere minx that she often hoped he would again bring Cissy.\r\nThe difficulty of this, however, was constantly present to her, for the\r\nkind of communion to which Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s so richly ministered rested on the\r\nfact that Cissy and he were so often in different places. She knew by\r\nthis time all the places\xe2\x80\x94Suchbury, Monkhouse, Whiteroy, Finches\xe2\x80\x94and\r\neven how the parties on these occasions were composed; but her subtlety\r\nfound ways to make her knowledge fairly protect and promote their\r\nkeeping, as she had heard Mrs. Jordan say, in touch. So, when he\r\nactually sometimes smiled as if he really felt the awkwardness of\r\ngiving her again one of the same old addresses, all her being went out\r\nin the desire\xe2\x80\x94which her face must have expressed\xe2\x80\x94that he should\r\nrecognise her forbearance to criticise as one of the finest tenderest\r\nsacrifices a woman had ever made for love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was occasionally worried, however this might be, by the impression\r\nthat these sacrifices, great as they were, were nothing to those that\r\nhis own passion had imposed; if indeed it was not rather the passion of\r\nhis confederate, which had caught him up and was whirling him round\r\nlike a great steam-wheel. He was at any rate in the strong grip of a\r\ndizzy splendid fate; the wild wind of his life blew him straight before\r\nit. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t she catch in his face at times, even through his smile and\r\nhis happy habit, the gleam of that pale glare with which a bewildered\r\nvictim appeals, as he passes, to some pair of pitying eyes? He perhaps\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t even himself know how scared he was; but _she_ knew. They were\r\nin danger, they were in danger, Captain Everard and Lady Bradeen: it\r\nbeat every novel in the shop. She thought of Mr. Mudge and his safe\r\nsentiment; she thought of herself and blushed even more for her tepid\r\nresponse to it. It was a comfort to her at such moments to feel that in\r\nanother relation\xe2\x80\x94a relation supplying that affinity with her nature\r\nthat Mr. Mudge, deluded creature, would never supply\xe2\x80\x94she should have\r\nbeen no more tepid than her ladyship. Her deepest soundings were on two\r\nor three occasions of finding herself almost sure that, if she dared,\r\nher ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s lover would have gathered relief from \xe2\x80\x9cspeaking\xe2\x80\x9d to her.\r\nShe literally fancied once or twice that, projected as he was toward\r\nhis doom, her own eyes struck him, while the air roared in his ears, as\r\nthe one pitying pair in the crowd. But how could he speak to her while\r\nshe sat sandwiched there between the counter-clerk and the sounder?\r\n\r\nShe had long ago, in her comings and goings made acquaintance with Park\r\nChambers and reflected as she looked up at their luxurious front that\r\n_they_, of course, would supply the ideal setting for the ideal speech.\r\nThere was not an object in London that, before the season was over, was\r\nmore stamped upon her brain. She went roundabout to pass it, for it was\r\nnot on the short way; she passed on the opposite side of the street and\r\nalways looked up, though it had taken her a long time to be sure of the\r\nparticular set of windows. She had made that out finally by an act of\r\naudacity that at the time had almost stopped her heart-beats and that\r\nin retrospect greatly quickened her blushes. One evening she had\r\nlingered late and watched\xe2\x80\x94watched for some moment when the porter, who\r\nwas in uniform and often on the steps, had gone in with a visitor. Then\r\nshe followed boldly, on the calculation that he would have taken the\r\nvisitor up and that the hall would be free. The hall _was_ free, and\r\nthe electric light played over the gilded and lettered board that\r\nshowed the names and numbers of the occupants of the different floors.\r\nWhat she wanted looked straight at her\xe2\x80\x94Captain Everard was on the\r\nthird. It was as if, in the immense intimacy of this, they were, for\r\nthe instant and the first time, face to face outside the cage. Alas!\r\nthey were face to face but a second or two: she was whirled out on the\r\nwings of a panic fear that he might just then be entering or issuing.\r\nThis fear was indeed, in her shameless deflexions, never very far from\r\nher, and was mixed in the oddest way with depressions and\r\ndisappointments. It was dreadful, as she trembled by, to run the risk\r\nof looking to him as if she basely hung about; and yet it was dreadful\r\nto be obliged to pass only at such moments as put an encounter out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nAt the horrible hour of her first coming to Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s he was always\xe2\x80\x94it\r\nwas to be hoped\xe2\x80\x94snug in bed; and at the hour of her final departure he\r\nwas of course\xe2\x80\x94she had such things all on her fingers\xe2\x80\x99-ends\xe2\x80\x94dressing for\r\ndinner. We may let it pass that if she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring herself to hover\r\ntill he was dressed, this was simply because such a process for such a\r\nperson could only be terribly prolonged. When she went in the middle of\r\nthe day to her own dinner she had too little time to do anything but go\r\nstraight, though it must be added that for a real certainty she would\r\njoyously have omitted the repast. She had made up her mind as to there\r\nbeing on the whole no decent pretext to justify her flitting casually\r\npast at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. That was the hour at which, if\r\nthe ha\xe2\x80\x99penny novels were not all wrong, he probably came home for the\r\nnight. She was therefore reduced to the vainest figuration of the\r\nmiraculous meeting toward which a hundred impossibilities would have to\r\nconspire. But if nothing was more impossible than the fact, nothing was\r\nmore intense than the vision. What may not, we can only moralise, take\r\nplace in the quickened muffled perception of a young person with an\r\nardent soul? All our humble friend\xe2\x80\x99s native distinction, her refinement\r\nof personal grain, of heredity, of pride, took refuge in this small\r\nthrobbing spot; for when she was most conscious of the objection of her\r\nvanity and the pitifulness of her little flutters and manoeuvres, then\r\nthe consolation and the redemption were most sure to glow before her in\r\nsome just discernible sign. He did like her!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe never brought Cissy back, but Cissy came one day without him, as\r\nfresh as before from the hands of Marguerite, or only, at the season\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nend, a trifle less fresh. She was, however, distinctly less serene. She\r\nhad brought nothing with her and looked about with impatience for the\r\nforms and the place to write. The latter convenience, at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, was\r\nobscure and barely adequate, and her clear voice had the light note of\r\ndisgust which her lover\xe2\x80\x99s never showed as she responded with a \xe2\x80\x9cThere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nof surprise to the gesture made by the counter-clerk in answer to her\r\nsharp question. Our young friend was busy with half a dozen people, but\r\nshe had dispatched them in her most businesslike manner by the time her\r\nladyship flung through the bars this light of re-appearance. Then the\r\ndirectness with which the girl managed to receive the accompanying\r\nmissive was the result of the concentration that had caused her to make\r\nthe stamps fly during the few minutes occupied by the production of it.\r\nThis concentration, in turn, may be described as the effect of the\r\napprehension of imminent relief. It was nineteen days, counted and\r\nchecked off, since she had seen the object of her homage; and as, had\r\nhe been in London, she should, with his habits, have been sure to see\r\nhim often, she was now about to learn what other spot his presence\r\nmight just then happen to sanctify. For she thought of them, the other\r\nspots, as ecstatically conscious of it, expressively happy in it.\r\n\r\nBut, gracious, how handsome _was_ her ladyship, and what an added price\r\nit gave him that the air of intimacy he threw out should have flowed\r\noriginally from such a source! The girl looked straight through the\r\ncage at the eyes and lips that must so often have been so near as\r\nown\xe2\x80\x94looked at them with a strange passion that for an instant had the\r\nresult of filling out some of the gaps, supplying the missing answers,\r\nin his correspondence. Then as she made out that the features she thus\r\nscanned and associated were totally unaware of it, that they glowed\r\nonly with the colour of quite other and not at all guessable thoughts,\r\nthis directly added to their splendour, gave the girl the sharpest\r\nimpression she had yet received of the uplifted, the unattainable\r\nplains of heaven, and yet at the same time caused her to thrill with a\r\nsense of the high company she did somehow keep. She was with the absent\r\nthrough her ladyship and with her ladyship through the absent. The only\r\npang\xe2\x80\x94but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter\xe2\x80\x94was the proof in the admirable face, in the\r\nsightless preoccupation of its possessor, that the latter hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\nnotion of her. Her folly had gone to the point of half believing that\r\nthe other party to the affair must sometimes mention in Eaton Square\r\nthe extraordinary little person at the place from which he so often\r\nwired. Yet the perception of her visitor\xe2\x80\x99s blankness actually helped\r\nthis extraordinary little person, the next instant, to take refuge in a\r\nreflexion that could be as proud as it liked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow little she knows,\r\nhow little she knows!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl cried to herself; for what did that\r\nshow after all but that Captain Everard\xe2\x80\x99s telegraphic confidant was\r\nCaptain Everard\xe2\x80\x99s charming secret? Our young friend\xe2\x80\x99s perusal of her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s telegram was literally prolonged by a momentary daze: what\r\nswam between her and the words, making her see them as through rippled\r\nshallow sunshot water, was the great, the perpetual flood of \xe2\x80\x9cHow much\r\n_I_ know\xe2\x80\x94how much _I_ know!\xe2\x80\x9d This produced a delay in her catching\r\nthat, on the face, these words didn\xe2\x80\x99t give her what she wanted, though\r\nshe was prompt enough with her remembrance that her grasp was, half the\r\ntime, just of what was _not_ on the face. \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Dolman, Parade Lodge,\r\nParade Terrace, Dover. Let him instantly know right one, H\xc3\xb4tel de\r\nFrance, Ostend. Make it seven nine four nine six one. Wire me\r\nalternative Burfield\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl slowly counted. Then he was at Ostend. This hooked on with so\r\nsharp a click that, not to feel she was as quickly letting it all slip\r\nfrom her, she had absolutely to hold it a minute longer and to do\r\nsomething to that end. Thus it was that she did on this occasion what\r\nshe never did\xe2\x80\x94threw off a \xe2\x80\x9cReply paid?\xe2\x80\x9d that sounded officious, but\r\nthat she partly made up for by deliberately affixing the stamps and by\r\nwaiting till she had done so to give change. She had, for so much\r\ncoolness, the strength that she considered she knew all about Miss\r\nDolman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x94paid.\xe2\x80\x9d She saw all sorts of things in this reply, even to a small\r\nsuppressed start of surprise at so correct an assumption; even to an\r\nattempt the next minute at a fresh air of detachment. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much, with\r\nthe answer?\xe2\x80\x9d The calculation was not abstruse, but our intense observer\r\nrequired a moment more to make it, and this gave her ladyship time for\r\na second thought. \xe2\x80\x9cOh just wait!\xe2\x80\x9d The white begemmed hand bared to\r\nwrite rose in sudden nervousness to the side of the wonderful face\r\nwhich, with eyes of anxiety for the paper on the counter, she brought\r\ncloser to the bars of the cage. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I must alter a word!\xe2\x80\x9d On this\r\nshe recovered her telegram and looked over it again; but she had a new,\r\nan obvious trouble, and studied it without deciding and with much of\r\nthe effect of making our young woman watch her.\r\n\r\nThis personage, meanwhile, at the sight of her expression, had decided\r\non the spot. If she had always been sure they were in danger her\r\nladyship\xe2\x80\x99s expression was the best possible sign of it. There was a\r\nword wrong, but she had lost the right one, and much clearly depended\r\non her finding it again. The girl, therefore, sufficiently estimating\r\nthe affluence of customers and the distraction of Mr. Buckton and the\r\ncounter-clerk, took the jump and gave it. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t it Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as if she had bodily leaped\xe2\x80\x94cleared the top of the cage and\r\nalighted on her interlocutress. \xe2\x80\x9cCooper\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the stare was heightened by\r\na blush. Yes, she had made Juno blush.\r\n\r\nThis was all the greater reason for going on. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean instead of\r\nBurfield\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur young friend fairly pitied her; she had made her in an instant so\r\nhelpless, and yet not a bit haughty nor outraged. She was only\r\nmystified and scared. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, you know\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d Our young friend smiled, meeting the other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and,\r\nhaving made Juno blush, proceeded to patronise her. \xe2\x80\x9c_I\xe2\x80\x99ll_ do it\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nput out a competent hand. Her ladyship only submitted, confused and\r\nbewildered, all presence of mind quite gone; and the next moment the\r\ntelegram was in the cage again and its author out of the shop. Then\r\nquickly, boldly, under all the eyes that might have witnessed her\r\ntampering, the extraordinary little person at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s made the proper\r\nchange. People were really too giddy, and if they _were_, in a certain\r\ncase, to be caught, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the fault of her own grand memory.\r\nHadn\xe2\x80\x99t it been settled weeks before?\xe2\x80\x94for Miss Dolman it was always to\r\nbe \xe2\x80\x9cCooper\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the summer \xe2\x80\x9cholidays\xe2\x80\x9d brought a marked difference; they were\r\nholidays for almost every one but the animals in the cage. The August\r\ndays were flat and dry, and, with so little to feed it, she was\r\nconscious of the ebb of her interest in the secrets of the refined. She\r\nwas in a position to follow the refined to the extent of knowing\xe2\x80\x94they\r\nhad made so many of their arrangements with her aid\xe2\x80\x94exactly where they\r\nwere; yet she felt quite as if the panorama had ceased unrolling and\r\nthe band stopped playing. A stray member of the latter occasionally\r\nturned up, but the communications that passed before her bore now\r\nlargely on rooms at hotels, prices of furnished houses, hours of\r\ntrains, dates of sailings and arrangements for being \xe2\x80\x9cmet\xe2\x80\x9d; she found\r\nthem for the most part prosaic and coarse. The only thing was that they\r\nbrought into her stuffy corner as straight a whiff of Alpine meadows\r\nand Scotch moors as she might hope ever to inhale; there were moreover\r\nin especial fat hot dull ladies who had out with her, to exasperation,\r\nthe terms for seaside lodgings, which struck her as huge, and the\r\nmatter of the number of beds required, which was not less portentous:\r\nthis in reference to places of which the names\xe2\x80\x94Eastbourne, Folkestone,\r\nCromer, Scarborough, Whitby\xe2\x80\x94tormented her with something of the sound\r\nof the plash of water that haunts the traveller in the desert. She had\r\nnot been out of London for a dozen years, and the only thing to give a\r\ntaste to the present dead weeks was the spice of a chronic resentment.\r\nThe sparse customers, the people she did see, were the people who were\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cjust off\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94off on the decks of fluttered yachts, off to the uttermost\r\npoint of rocky headlands where the very breeze was then playing for the\r\nwant of which she said to herself that she sickened.\r\n\r\nThere was accordingly a sense in which, at such a period, the great\r\ndifferences of the human condition could press upon her more than ever;\r\na circumstance drawing fresh force in truth from the very fact of the\r\nchance that at last, for a change, did squarely meet her\xe2\x80\x94the chance to\r\nbe \xe2\x80\x9coff,\xe2\x80\x9d for a bit, almost as far as anybody. They took their turns in\r\nthe cage as they took them both in the shop and at Chalk Farm; she had\r\nknown these two months that time was to be allowed in September\xe2\x80\x94no less\r\nthan eleven days\xe2\x80\x94for her personal private holiday. Much of her recent\r\nintercourse with Mr. Mudge had consisted of the hopes and fears,\r\nexpressed mainly by himself, involved in the question of their getting\r\nthe same dates\xe2\x80\x94a question that, in proportion as the delight seemed\r\nassured, spread into a sea of speculation over the choice of where and\r\nhow. All through July, on the Sunday evenings and at such other odd\r\ntimes as he could seize, he had flooded their talk with wild waves of\r\ncalculation. It was practically settled that, with her mother,\r\nsomewhere \xe2\x80\x9con the south coast\xe2\x80\x9d (a phrase of which she liked the sound)\r\nthey should put in their allowance together; but she already felt the\r\nprospect quite weary and worn with the way he went round and round on\r\nit. It had become his sole topic, the theme alike of his most solemn\r\nprudences and most placid jests, to which every opening led for return\r\nand revision and in which every little flower of a foretaste was pulled\r\nup as soon as planted. He had announced at the earliest\r\nday\xe2\x80\x94characterising the whole business, from that moment, as their\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cplans,\xe2\x80\x9d under which name he handled it as a Syndicate handles a\r\nChinese or other Loan\xe2\x80\x94he had promptly declared that the question must\r\nbe thoroughly studied, and he produced, on the whole subject, from day\r\nto day, an amount of information that excited her wonder and even, not\r\na little, as she frankly let him know, her disdain. When she thought of\r\nthe danger in which another pair of lovers rapturously lived she\r\nenquired of him anew why he could leave nothing to chance. Then she got\r\nfor answer that this profundity was just his pride, and he pitted\r\nRamsgate against Bournemouth and even Boulogne against Jersey\xe2\x80\x94for he\r\nhad great ideas\xe2\x80\x94with all the mastery of detail that was some day,\r\nprofessionally, to carry him afar.\r\n\r\nThe longer the time since she had seen Captain Everard the more she was\r\nbooked, as she called it, to pass Park Chambers; and this was the sole\r\namusement that in the lingering August days and the twilights sadly\r\ndrawn out it was left her to cultivate. She had long since learned to\r\nknow it for a feeble one, though its feebleness was perhaps scarce the\r\nreason for her saying to herself each evening as her time for departure\r\napproached: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no\xe2\x80\x94not to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d She never failed of that silent\r\nremark, any more than she failed of feeling, in some deeper place than\r\nshe had even yet fully sounded, that one\xe2\x80\x99s remarks were as weak as\r\nstraws and that, however one might indulge in them at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s fate infallibly declared itself in absolute indifference to them\r\nat about eight-fifteen. Remarks were remarks, and very well for that;\r\nbut fate was fate, and this young lady\xe2\x80\x99s was to pass Park Chambers\r\nevery night in the working week. Out of the immensity of her knowledge\r\nof the life of the world there bloomed on these occasions as specific\r\nremembrance that it was regarded in that region, in August and\r\nSeptember, as rather pleasant just to be caught for something or other\r\nin passing through town. Somebody was always passing and somebody might\r\ncatch somebody else. It was in full cognisance of this subtle law that\r\nshe adhered to the most ridiculous circuit she could have made to get\r\nhome. One warm dull featureless Friday, when an accident had made her\r\nstart from Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s a little later than usual, she became aware that\r\nsomething of which the infinite possibilities had for so long peopled\r\nher dreams was at last prodigiously upon her, though the perfection in\r\nwhich the conditions happened to present it was almost rich enough to\r\nbe but the positive creation of a dream. She saw, straight before her,\r\nlike a vista painted in a picture, the empty street and the lamps that\r\nburned pale in the dusk not yet established. It was into the\r\nconvenience of this quiet twilight that a gentleman on the doorstep of\r\nthe Chambers gazed with a vagueness that our young lady\xe2\x80\x99s little figure\r\nviolently trembled, in the approach, with the measure of its power to\r\ndissipate. Everything indeed grew in a flash terrific and distinct; her\r\nold uncertainties fell away from her, and, since she was so familiar\r\nwith fate, she felt as if the very nail that fixed it were driven in by\r\nthe hard look with which, for a moment, Captain Everard awaited her.\r\n\r\nThe vestibule was open behind him and the porter as absent as on the\r\nday she had peeped in; he had just come out\xe2\x80\x94was in town, in a tweed\r\nsuit and a pot hat, but between two journeys\xe2\x80\x94duly bored over his\r\nevening and at a loss what to do with it. Then it was that she was glad\r\nshe had never met him in that way before: she reaped with such ecstasy\r\nthe benefit of his not being able to think she passed often. She jumped\r\nin two seconds to the determination that he should even suppose it to\r\nbe the very first time and the very oddest chance: this was while she\r\nstill wondered if he would identify or notice her. His original\r\nattention had not, she instinctively knew, been for the young woman at\r\nCocker\xe2\x80\x99s; it had only been for any young woman who might advance to the\r\ntune of her not troubling the quiet air, and in fact the poetic hour,\r\nwith ugliness. Ah but then, and just as she had reached the door, came\r\nhis second observation, a long light reach with which, visibly and\r\nquite amusedly, he recalled and placed her. They were on different\r\nsides, but the street, narrow and still, had only made more of a stage\r\nfor the small momentary drama. It was not over, besides, it was far\r\nfrom over, even on his sending across the way, with the pleasantest\r\nlaugh she had ever heard, a little lift of his hat and an \xe2\x80\x9cOh good\r\nevening!\xe2\x80\x9d It was still less over on their meeting, the next minute,\r\nthough rather indirectly and awkwardly, in the middle, of the road\xe2\x80\x94a\r\nsituation to which three or four steps of her own had unmistakeably\r\ncontributed\xe2\x80\x94and then passing not again to the side on which she had\r\narrived, but back toward the portal of Park Chambers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you at first. Are you taking a walk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh I don\xe2\x80\x99t take walks at night! I\xe2\x80\x99m going home after my work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat was practically what they had meanwhile smiled out, and his\r\nexclamation to which for a minute he appeared to have nothing to add,\r\nleft them face to face and in just such an attitude as, for his part,\r\nhe might have worn had he been wondering if he could properly ask her\r\nto come in. During this interval in fact she really felt his question\r\nto be just \xe2\x80\x9c_How_ properly\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d It was simply a question of the degree of\r\nproperness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe never knew afterwards quite what she had done to settle it, and at\r\nthe time she only knew that they presently moved, with vagueness, yet\r\nwith continuity, away from the picture of the lighted vestibule and the\r\nquiet stairs and well up the street together. This also must have been\r\nin the absence of a definite permission, of anything vulgarly\r\narticulate, for that matter, on the part of either; and it was to be,\r\nlater on, a thing of remembrance and reflexion for her that the limit\r\nof what just here for a longish minute passed between them was his\r\ntaking in her thoroughly successful deprecation, though conveyed\r\nwithout pride or sound or touch, of the idea that she might be, out of\r\nthe cage, the very shop-girl at large that she hugged the theory she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Yes, it was strange, she afterwards thought, that so much could\r\nhave come and gone and yet not disfigured the dear little intense\r\ncrisis either with impertinence or with resentment, with any of the\r\nhorrid notes of that kind of acquaintance. He had taken no liberty, as\r\nshe would have so called it; and, through not having to betray the\r\nsense of one, she herself had, still more charmingly, taken none. On\r\nthe spot, nevertheless, she could speculate as to what it meant that,\r\nif his relation with Lady Bradeen continued to be what her mind had\r\nbuilt it up to, he should feel free to proceed with marked\r\nindependence. This was one of the questions he was to leave her to deal\r\nwith\xe2\x80\x94the question whether people of his sort still asked girls up to\r\ntheir rooms when they were so awfully in love with other women. Could\r\npeople of his sort do that without what people of _her_ sort would call\r\nbeing \xe2\x80\x9cfalse to their love\xe2\x80\x9d? She had already a vision of how the true\r\nanswer was that people of her sort didn\xe2\x80\x99t, in such cases, matter\xe2\x80\x94didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncount as infidelity, counted only as something else: she might have\r\nbeen curious, since it came to that, to see exactly what.\r\n\r\nStrolling together slowly in their summer twilight and their empty\r\ncorner of Mayfair, they found themselves emerge at last opposite to one\r\nof the smaller gates of the Park; upon which, without any particular\r\nword about it\xe2\x80\x94they were talking so of other things\xe2\x80\x94they crossed the\r\nstreet and went in and sat down on a bench. She had gathered by this\r\ntime one magnificent hope about him\xe2\x80\x94the hope he would say nothing\r\nvulgar. She knew thoroughly what she meant by that; she meant something\r\nquite apart from any matter of his being \xe2\x80\x9cfalse.\xe2\x80\x9d Their bench was not\r\nfar within; it was near the Park Lane paling and the patchy lamplight\r\nand the rumbling cabs and \xe2\x80\x98buses. A strange emotion had come to her,\r\nand she felt indeed excitement within excitement; above all a conscious\r\njoy in testing him with chances he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take. She had an intense\r\ndesire he should know the type she really conformed to without her\r\ndoing anything so low as tell him, and he had surely begun to know it\r\nfrom the moment he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seize the opportunities into which a common\r\nman would promptly have blundered. These were on the mere awkward\r\nsurface, and _their_ relation was beautiful behind and below them. She\r\nhad questioned so little on the way what they might be doing that as\r\nsoon as they were seated she took straight hold of it. Her hours, her\r\nconfinement, the many conditions of service in the post-office,\r\nhad\xe2\x80\x94with a glance at his own postal resources and alternatives\xe2\x80\x94formed,\r\nup to this stage, the subject of their talk. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, here we are, and it\r\nmay be right enough; but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the least, you know, where I was\r\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were going home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and I was already rather late. I was going to my supper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t had it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t eaten\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked of a sudden so extravagantly concerned that she laughed out.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll day? Yes, we do feed once. But that was long ago. So I must\r\npresently say good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh deary _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed with an intonation so droll and yet a\r\ntouch so light and a distress so marked\xe2\x80\x94a confession of helplessness\r\nfor such a case, in short, so unrelieved\xe2\x80\x94that she at once felt sure she\r\nhad made the great difference plain. He looked at her with the kindest\r\neyes and still without saying what she had known he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. She had\r\nknown he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x9cThen sup with _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d but the proof of it made\r\nher feel as if she had feasted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a bit hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh you _must_ be, awfully!\xe2\x80\x9d he made answer, but settling himself on\r\nthe bench as if, after all, that needn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with his spending\r\nhis evening. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always quite wanted the chance to thank you for the\r\ntrouble you so often take for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; uttering the words with a sense of the\r\nsituation far deeper than any pretence of not fitting his allusion. She\r\nimmediately felt him surprised and even a little puzzled at her frank\r\nassent; but for herself the trouble she had taken could only, in these\r\nfleeting minutes\xe2\x80\x94they would probably never come back\xe2\x80\x94be all there like\r\na little hoard of gold in her lap. Certainly he might look at it,\r\nhandle it, take up the pieces. Yet if he understood anything he must\r\nunderstand all. \xe2\x80\x9cI consider you\xe2\x80\x99ve already immensely thanked me.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nhorror was back upon her of having seemed to hang about for some\r\nreward. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s awfully odd you should have been there just the one\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one time you\xe2\x80\x99ve passed my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; you can fancy I haven\xe2\x80\x99t many minutes to waste. There was a place\r\nto-night I had to stop at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d he knew already so much about her work. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be an\r\nawful grind\xe2\x80\x94for a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I groan over it any more than my\r\ncompanions\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen _they\xe2\x80\x99re_ not ladies!\xe2\x80\x9d She mildly jested,\r\nbut with an intention. \xe2\x80\x9cOne gets used to things, and there are\r\nemployments I should have hated much more.\xe2\x80\x9d She had the finest\r\nconception of the beauty of not at least boring him. To whine, to count\r\nup her wrongs, was what a barmaid or a shop-girl would do, and it was\r\nquite enough to sit there like one of these.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had had another employment,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarked after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nmight never have become acquainted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s highly probable\xe2\x80\x94and certainly not in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, still\r\nwith her heap of gold in her lap and something of the pride of it in\r\nher manner of holding her head, she continued not to move\xe2\x80\x94she only\r\nsmiled at him. The evening had thickened now; the scattered lamps were\r\nred; the Park, all before them, was full of obscure and ambiguous life;\r\nthere were other couples on other benches whom it was impossible not to\r\nsee, yet at whom it was impossible to look. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked so much\r\nout of my way with you only just to show you that\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with this she\r\npaused; it was not after all so easy to express\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthat anything you may\r\nhave thought is perfectly true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought a tremendous lot!\xe2\x80\x9d her companion laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mind\r\nmy smoking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I? You always smoke _there_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt your place? Oh yes, but here it\xe2\x80\x99s different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as he lighted a cigarette, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s just what it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, that\xe2\x80\x99s because \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99 it\xe2\x80\x99s so wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re conscious of how wonderful it is?\xe2\x80\x9d she returned.\r\n\r\nHe jerked his handsome head in literal protest at a doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexactly what I mean by my gratitude for all your trouble. It has been\r\njust as if you took a particular interest.\xe2\x80\x9d She only looked at him by\r\nway of answer in such sudden headlong embarrassment, as she was quite\r\naware, that while she remained silent he showed himself checked by her\r\nexpression. \xe2\x80\x9cYou _have_\xe2\x80\x94haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x94taken a particular interest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh a particular interest!\xe2\x80\x9d she quavered out, feeling the whole\r\nthing\xe2\x80\x94her headlong embarrassment\xe2\x80\x94get terribly the better of her, and\r\nwishing, with a sudden scare, all the more to keep her emotion down.\r\nShe maintained her fixed smile a moment and turned her eyes over the\r\npeopled darkness, unconfused now, because there was something much more\r\nconfusing. This, with a fatal great rush, was simply the fact that they\r\nwere thus together. They were near, near, and all she had imagined of\r\nthat had only become more true, more dreadful and overwhelming. She\r\nstared straight away in silence till she felt she looked an idiot;\r\nthen, to say something, to say nothing, she attempted a sound which\r\nended in a flood of tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer tears helped her really to dissimulate, for she had instantly, in\r\nso public a situation, to recover herself. They had come and gone in\r\nhalf a minute, and she immediately explained them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x98s only because\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m tired. It\xe2\x80\x99s that\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s that!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added a trifle incoherently:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall never see you again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh but why not?\xe2\x80\x9d The mere tone in which her companion asked this\r\nsatisfied her once for all as to the amount of imagination for which\r\nshe could count on him. It was naturally not large: it had exhausted\r\nitself in having arrived at what he had already touched upon\xe2\x80\x94the sense\r\nof an intention in her poor zeal at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s. But any deficiency of\r\nthis kind was no fault in him: _he_ wasn\xe2\x80\x99t obliged to have an inferior\r\ncleverness\xe2\x80\x94to have second-rate resources and virtues. It had been as if\r\nhe almost really believed she had simply cried for fatigue, and he\r\naccordingly put in some kind confused plea\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought really to take\r\nsomething: won\xe2\x80\x99t you have something or other _somewhere_?\xe2\x80\x9d to which she\r\nhad made no response but a headshake of a sharpness that settled it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy shan\xe2\x80\x99t we all the more keep meeting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mean meeting this way\xe2\x80\x94only this way. At my place there\xe2\x80\x94_that_ I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nnothing to do with, and I hope of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll turn up, with your\r\ncorrespondence, when it suits you. Whether I stay or not, I mean; for I\r\nshall probably not stay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going somewhere else?\xe2\x80\x9d he put it with positive anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ever so far away\xe2\x80\x94to the other end of London. There are all sorts\r\nof reasons I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you; and it\xe2\x80\x99s practically settled. It\xe2\x80\x99s better\r\nfor me, much; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve only kept on at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaking out in the dusk that he fairly blushed, she now measured how far\r\nhe had been from knowing too much. Too much, she called it at present;\r\nand that was easy, since it proved so abundantly enough for her that he\r\nshould simply be where he was. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we shall never talk this way but\r\nto-night\xe2\x80\x94never, never again!\xe2\x80\x94here it all is. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nwhat you think; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; I only want to help you. Besides,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re kind\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99re kind. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking then of leaving for ever so\r\nlong. But you\xe2\x80\x99ve come so often\xe2\x80\x94at times\xe2\x80\x94and you\xe2\x80\x99ve had so much to do,\r\nand it has been so pleasant and interesting, that I\xe2\x80\x99ve remained, I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nkept putting off any change. More than once, when I had nearly decided,\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve turned up again and I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought \xe2\x80\x98Oh no!\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s the simple\r\nfact!\xe2\x80\x9d She had by this time got her confusion down so completely that\r\nshe could laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I meant when I said to you just now that\r\nI \xe2\x80\x98knew.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve known perfectly that you knew I took trouble for you;\r\nand that knowledge has been for me, and I seemed to see it was for you,\r\nas if there were something\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call it!\xe2\x80\x94between us. I\r\nmean something unusual and good and awfully nice\xe2\x80\x94something not a bit\r\nhorrid or vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe had by this time, she could see, produced a great effect on him;\r\nbut she would have spoken the truth to herself had she at the same\r\nmoment declared that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least care: all the more that\r\nthe effect must be one of extreme perplexity. What, in it all, was\r\nvisibly clear for him, none the less, was that he was tremendously glad\r\nhe had met her. She held him, and he was astonished at the force of it;\r\nhe was intent, immensely considerate. His elbow was on the back of the\r\nseat, and his head, with the pot-hat pushed quite back, in a boyish\r\nway, so that she really saw almost for the first time his forehead and\r\nhair, rested on the hand into which he had crumpled his gloves. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe assented, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not a bit horrid or vulgar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe just hung fire a moment, then she brought out the whole truth. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ndo anything for you. I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything for you.\xe2\x80\x9d Never in her life had\r\nshe known anything so high and fine as this, just letting him have it\r\nand bravely and magnificently leaving it. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t the place, the\r\nassociations and circumstances, perfectly make it sound what it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t?\r\nand wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly the beauty?\r\n\r\nSo she bravely and magnificently left it, and little by little she felt\r\nhim take it up, take it down, as if they had been on a satin sofa in a\r\nboudoir. She had never seen a boudoir, but there had been lots of\r\nboudoirs in the telegrams. What she had said at all events sank into\r\nhim, so that after a minute he simply made a movement that had the\r\nresult of placing his hand on her own\xe2\x80\x94presently indeed that of her\r\nfeeling herself firmly enough grasped. There was no pressure she need\r\nreturn, there was none she need decline; she just sat admirably still,\r\nsatisfied for the time with the surprise and bewilderment of the\r\nimpression she made on him. His agitation was even greater on the whole\r\nthan she had at first allowed for. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, you know, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\nof leaving!\xe2\x80\x9d he at last broke out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf leaving Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you must stay on there, whatever happens, and help a fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was silent a little, partly because it was so strange and exquisite\r\nto feel him watch her as if it really mattered to him and he were\r\nalmost in suspense. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you _have_ quite recognised what I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried\r\nto do?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly what I dashed over from my door just now to\r\nthank you for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; so you said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you believe it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked down a moment at his hand, which continued to cover her own;\r\nwhereupon he presently drew it back, rather restlessly folding his\r\narms. Without answering his question she went on: \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever spoken\r\nof me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpoken of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf my being there\xe2\x80\x94of my knowing, and that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh never to a human creature!\xe2\x80\x9d he eagerly declared.\r\n\r\nShe had a small drop at this, which was expressed in another pause, and\r\nshe then returned to what he had just asked her. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, I quite\r\nbelieve you like it\xe2\x80\x94my always being there and our taking things up so\r\nfamiliarly and successfully: if not exactly where we left them,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nlaughed, \xe2\x80\x9calmost always at least at an interesting point!\xe2\x80\x9d He was about\r\nto say something in reply to this, but her friendly gaiety was quicker.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou want a great many things in life, a great many comforts and helps\r\nand luxuries\xe2\x80\x94you want everything as pleasant as possible. Therefore, so\r\nfar as it\xe2\x80\x99s in the power of any particular person to contribute to all\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d She had turned her face to him smiling, just thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh see here!\xe2\x80\x9d But he was highly amused. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what then?\xe2\x80\x9d he enquired\r\nas if to humour her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy the particular person must never fail. We must manage it for you\r\nsomehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe threw back his head, laughing out; he was really exhilarated. \xe2\x80\x9cOh\r\nyes, somehow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I think we each do\xe2\x80\x94don\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x94in one little way and another and\r\naccording to our limited lights. I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased at any rate, for myself,\r\nthat you are; for I assure you I\xe2\x80\x99ve done my best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do better than any one!\xe2\x80\x9d He had struck a match for another\r\ncigarette, and the flame lighted an instant his responsive finished\r\nface, magnifying into a pleasant grimace the kindness with which he\r\npaid her this tribute. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re awfully clever, you know; cleverer,\r\ncleverer, cleverer\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d He had appeared on the point of making some\r\ntremendous statement; then suddenly, puffing his cigarette and shifting\r\nalmost with violence on his seat, he let it altogether fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of this drop, if not just by reason of it, she felt as if Lady\r\nBradeen, all but named out, had popped straight up; and she practically\r\nbetrayed her consciousness by waiting a little before she rejoined:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCleverer than who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t afraid you\xe2\x80\x99d think I swagger, I should say\xe2\x80\x94than\r\nanybody! If you leave your place there, where shall you go?\xe2\x80\x9d he more\r\ngravely asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh too far for you ever to find me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d find you anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe tone of this was so still more serious that she had but her one\r\nacknowledgement. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do anything for you\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nrepeated. She had already, she felt, said it all; so what did anything\r\nmore, anything less, matter? That was the very reason indeed why she\r\ncould, with a lighter note, ease him generously of any awkwardness\r\nproduced by solemnity, either his own or hers. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it must be\r\nnice for you to be able to think there are people all about who feel in\r\nsuch a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn immediate appreciation of this, however, he only smoked without\r\nlooking at her. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give up your present work?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nat last threw out. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean you _will_ stay in the post-office?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes; I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve a genius for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather! No one can touch you.\xe2\x80\x9d With this he turned more to her again.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you can get, with a move, greater advantages?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can get in the suburbs cheaper lodgings. I live with my mother. We\r\nneed some space. There\xe2\x80\x99s a particular place that has other\r\ninducements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh quite out of _your_ way. You\xe2\x80\x99d never have time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I tell you I\xe2\x80\x99d go anywhere. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you believe it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for once or twice. But you\xe2\x80\x99d soon see it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe smoked and considered; seemed to stretch himself a little and, with\r\nhis legs out, surrender himself comfortably. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well\xe2\x80\x94I\r\nbelieve everything you say. I take it from you\xe2\x80\x94anything you like\xe2\x80\x94in the\r\nmost extraordinary way.\xe2\x80\x9d It struck her certainly\xe2\x80\x94and almost without\r\nbitterness\xe2\x80\x94that the way in which she was already, as if she had been an\r\nold friend, arranging for him and preparing the only magnificence she\r\ncould muster, was quite the most extraordinary. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t, _don\xe2\x80\x99t_ go!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\npresently went on. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall miss you too horribly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that you just put it to me as a definite request?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94oh how she tried\r\nto divest this of all sound of the hardness of bargaining! That ought\r\nto have been easy enough, for what was she arranging to get? Before he\r\ncould answer she had continued: \xe2\x80\x9cTo be perfectly fair I should tell you\r\nI recognise at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s certain strong attractions. All you people\r\ncome. I like all the horrors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe horrors?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose you all\xe2\x80\x94you know the set I mean, _your_ set\xe2\x80\x94show me with as good\r\na conscience as if I had no more feeling than a letter-box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked quite excited at the way she put it. \xe2\x80\x9cOh they don\xe2\x80\x99t know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know I\xe2\x80\x99m not stupid? No, how should they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, how should they?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Captain sympathetically. \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n\xe2\x80\x98horrors\xe2\x80\x99 rather strong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you _do_ is rather strong!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl promptly returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat _I_ do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour extravagance, your selfishness, your immorality, your crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe pursued, without heeding his expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI _say_!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94her companion showed the queerest stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI like them, as I tell you\xe2\x80\x94I revel in them. But we needn\xe2\x80\x99t go into\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x9d she quietly went on; \xe2\x80\x9cfor all I get out of it is the harmless\r\npleasure of knowing. I know, I know, I know!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she breathed it ever so\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that\xe2\x80\x99s what has been between us,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered much more simply.\r\n\r\nShe could enjoy his simplicity in silence, and for a moment she did so.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I do stay because you want it\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m rather capable of that\xe2\x80\x94there\r\nare two or three things I think you ought to remember. One is, you\r\nknow, that I\xe2\x80\x99m there sometimes for days and weeks together without your\r\never coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh I\xe2\x80\x99ll come every day!\xe2\x80\x9d he honestly cried.\r\n\r\nShe was on the point, at this, of imitating with her hand his movement\r\nof shortly before; but she checked herself, and there was no want of\r\neffect in her soothing substitute. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you? How can you?\xe2\x80\x9d He had,\r\ntoo manifestly, only to look at it there, in the vulgarly animated\r\ngloom, to see that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t; and at this point, by the mere action\r\nof his silence, everything they had so definitely not named, the whole\r\npresence round which they had been circling, became part of their\r\nreference, settled in solidly between them. It was as if then for a\r\nminute they sat and saw it all in each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, saw so much that\r\nthere was no need of a pretext for sounding it at last. \xe2\x80\x9cYour danger,\r\nyour danger\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d Her voice indeed trembled with it, and she could only\r\nfor the moment again leave it so.\r\n\r\nDuring this moment he leaned back on the bench, meeting her in silence\r\nand with a face that grew more strange. It grew so strange that after a\r\nfurther instant she got straight up. She stood there as if their talk\r\nwere now over, and he just sat and watched her. It was as if now\xe2\x80\x94owing\r\nto the third person they had brought in\xe2\x80\x94they must be more careful; so\r\nthat the most he could finally say was: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where it is!\xe2\x80\x9d the girl as guardedly replied. He sat still, and\r\nshe added: \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t give you up. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he appealed, but without moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see my way, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t give you up,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt brought him with a jerk to his feet, tossing away his cigarette. His\r\npoor face was flushed. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here\xe2\x80\x94see here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I won\xe2\x80\x99t; but I must leave you now,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on as if not hearing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here\xe2\x80\x94see here!\xe2\x80\x9d He tried, from the bench, to take her hand again.\r\n\r\nBut that definitely settled it for her: this would, after all, be as\r\nbad as his asking her to supper. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t come with me\xe2\x80\x94no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sank back, quite blank, as if she had pushed him. \xe2\x80\x9cI mayn\xe2\x80\x99t see you\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no; let me go.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked almost as if she had struck him, but she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care; and the manner in which she spoke\xe2\x80\x94it was literally as if\r\nshe were angry\xe2\x80\x94had the force of a command. \xe2\x80\x9cStay where you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here\xe2\x80\x94see here!\xe2\x80\x9d he nevertheless pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t give you up!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried once more\xe2\x80\x94this time quite with\r\npassion; on which she got away from him as fast as she could and left\r\nhim staring after her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mudge had lately been so occupied with their famous \xe2\x80\x9cplans\xe2\x80\x9d that he\r\nhad neglected for a while the question of her transfer; but down at\r\nBournemouth, which had found itself selected as the field of their\r\nrecreation by a process consisting, it seemed, exclusively of\r\ninnumerable pages of the neatest arithmetic in a very greasy but most\r\norderly little pocket-book, the distracting possible melted away\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nfleeting absolute ruled the scene. The plans, hour by hour, were simply\r\nsuperseded, and it was much of a rest to the girl, as she sat on the\r\npier and overlooked the sea and the company, to see them evaporate in\r\nrosy fumes and to feel that from moment to moment there was less left\r\nto cipher about. The week proves blissfully fine, and her mother, at\r\ntheir lodgings\xe2\x80\x94partly to her embarrassment and partly to her\r\nrelief\xe2\x80\x94struck up with the landlady an alliance that left the younger\r\ncouple a great deal of freedom. This relative took her pleasure of a\r\nweek at Bournemouth in a stuffy back-kitchen and endless talks; to that\r\ndegree even that Mr. Mudge himself\xe2\x80\x94habitually inclined indeed to a\r\nscrutiny of all mysteries and to seeing, as he sometimes admitted, too\r\nmuch in things\xe2\x80\x94made remarks on it as he sat on the cliff with his\r\nbetrothed, or on the decks of steamers that conveyed them, close-packed\r\nitems in terrific totals of enjoyment, to the Isle of Wight and the\r\nDorset coast.\r\n\r\nHe had a lodging in another house, where he had speedily learned the\r\nimportance of keeping his eyes open, and he made no secret of his\r\nsuspecting that sinister mutual connivances might spring, under the\r\nroof of his companions, from unnatural sociabilities. At the same time\r\nhe fully recognised that as a source of anxiety, not to say of expense,\r\nhis future mother-in law would have weighted them more by accompanying\r\ntheir steps than by giving her hostess, in the interest of the tendency\r\nthey considered that they never mentioned, equivalent pledges as to the\r\ntea-caddy and the jam-pot. These were the questions\xe2\x80\x94these indeed the\r\nfamiliar commodities\xe2\x80\x94that he had now to put into the scales; and his\r\nbetrothed had in consequence, during her holiday, the odd and yet\r\npleasant and almost languid sense of an anticlimax. She had become\r\nconscious of an extraordinary collapse, a surrender to stillness and to\r\nretrospect. She cared neither to walk nor to sail; it was enough for\r\nher to sit on benches and wonder at the sea and taste the air and not\r\nbe at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s and not see the counter-clerk. She still seemed to wait\r\nfor something\xe2\x80\x94something in the key of the immense discussions that had\r\nmapped out their little week of idleness on the scale of a world-atlas.\r\nSomething came at last, but without perhaps appearing quite adequately\r\nto crown the monument.\r\n\r\nPreparation and precaution were, however, the natural flowers of Mr.\r\nMudge\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and in proportion as these things declined in one quarter\r\nthey inevitably bloomed elsewhere. He could always, at the worst, have\r\non Tuesday the project of their taking the Swanage boat on Thursday,\r\nand on Thursday that of their ordering minced kidneys on Saturday. He\r\nhad moreover a constant gift of inexorable enquiry as to where and what\r\nthey should have gone and have done if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been exactly as they\r\nwere. He had in short his resources, and his mistress had never been so\r\nconscious of them; on the other hand they never interfered so little\r\nwith her own. She liked to be as she was\xe2\x80\x94if it could only have lasted.\r\nShe could accept even without bitterness a rigour of economy so great\r\nthat the little fee they paid for admission to the pier had to be\r\nbalanced against other delights. The people at Ladle\xe2\x80\x99s and at Thrupp\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhad _their_ ways of amusing themselves, whereas she had to sit and hear\r\nMr. Mudge talk of what he might do if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a bath, or of the\r\nbath he might take if he only hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken something else. He was\r\nalways with her now, of course, always beside her; she saw him more\r\nthan \xe2\x80\x9chourly,\xe2\x80\x9d more than ever yet, more even than he had planned she\r\nshould do at Chalk Farm. She preferred to sit at the far end, away from\r\nthe band and the crowd; as to which she had frequent differences with\r\nher friend, who reminded her often that they could have only in the\r\nthick of it the sense of the money they were getting back. That had\r\nlittle effect on her, for she got back her money by seeing many things,\r\nthe things of the past year, fall together and connect themselves,\r\nundergo the happy relegation that transforms melancholy and misery,\r\npassion and effort, into experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\nShe liked having done with them, as she assured herself she had\r\npractically done, and the strange thing was that she neither missed the\r\nprocession now nor wished to keep her place for it. It had become\r\nthere, in the sun and the breeze and the sea-smell, a far-away story, a\r\npicture of another life. If Mr. Mudge himself liked processions, liked\r\nthem at Bournemouth and on the pier quite as much as at Chalk Farm or\r\nanywhere, she learned after a little not to be worried by his perpetual\r\ncounting of the figures that made them up. There were dreadful women in\r\nparticular, usually fat and in men\xe2\x80\x99s caps and write shoes, whom he\r\ncould never let alone\xe2\x80\x94not that _she_ cared; it was not the great world,\r\nthe world of Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s and Ladle\xe2\x80\x99s and Thrupp\xe2\x80\x99s, but it offered an\r\nendless field to his faculties of memory, philosophy, and frolic. She\r\nhad never accepted him so much, never arranged so successfully for\r\nmaking him chatter while she carried on secret conversations. This\r\nseparate commerce was with herself; and if they both practised a great\r\nthrift she had quite mastered that of merely spending words enough to\r\nkeep him imperturbably and continuously going.\r\n\r\nHe was charmed with the panorama, not knowing\xe2\x80\x94or at any rate not at all\r\nshowing that he knew\xe2\x80\x94what far other images peopled her mind than the\r\nwomen in the navy caps and the shop-boys in the blazers. His\r\nobservations on these types, his general interpretation of the show,\r\nbrought home to her the prospect of Chalk Farm. She wondered sometimes\r\nthat he should have derived so little illumination, during his period,\r\nfrom the society at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s. But one evening while their holiday\r\ncloudlessly waned he gave her such a proof of his quality as might have\r\nmade her ashamed of her many suppressions. He brought out something\r\nthat, in all his overflow, he had been able to keep back till other\r\nmatters were disposed of. It was the announcement that he was at last\r\nready to marry\xe2\x80\x94that he saw his way. A rise at Chalk Farm had been\r\noffered him; he was to be taken into the business, bringing with him a\r\ncapital the estimation of which by other parties constituted the\r\nhandsomest recognition yet made of the head on his shoulders. Therefore\r\ntheir waiting was over\xe2\x80\x94it could be a question of a near date. They\r\nwould settle this date before going back, and he meanwhile had his eye\r\non a sweet little home. He would take her to see it on their first\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis having kept this great news for the last, having had such a card up\r\nhis sleeve and not floated it out in the current of his chatter and the\r\nluxury of their leisure, was one of those incalculable strokes by which\r\nhe could still affect her; the kind of thing that reminded her of the\r\nlatent force that had ejected the drunken soldier\xe2\x80\x94an example of the\r\nprofundity of which his promotion was the proof. She listened a while\r\nin silence, on this occasion, to the wafted strains of the music; she\r\ntook it in as she had not quite done before that her future was now\r\nconstituted. Mr. Mudge was distinctly her fate; yet at this moment she\r\nturned her face quite away from him, showing him so long a mere quarter\r\nof her cheek that she at last again heard his voice. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a\r\npair of tears that were partly the reason of her delay to give him the\r\nassurance he required; but he expressed at a venture the hope that she\r\nhad had her fill of Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nShe was finally able to turn back. \xe2\x80\x9cOh quite. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing going on.\r\nNo one comes but the Americans at Thrupp\xe2\x80\x99s, and _they_ don\xe2\x80\x99t do much.\r\nThey don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have a secret in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the extraordinary reason you\xe2\x80\x99ve been giving me for holding on\r\nthere has ceased to work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, that one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the thing through\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot them all in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a little again she made no answer. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not yet, all the same. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nstill got a reason\xe2\x80\x94a different one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked her all over as if it might have been something she kept in\r\nher mouth or her glove or under her jacket\xe2\x80\x94something she was even\r\nsitting upon. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have it, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went out the other night and sat in the Park with a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid at last.\r\n\r\nNothing was ever seen like his confidence in her and she wondered a\r\nlittle now why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t irritate her. It only gave her ease and space,\r\nas she felt, for telling him the whole truth that no one knew. It had\r\narrived at present at her really wanting to do that, and yet to do it\r\nnot in the least for Mr. Mudge, but altogether and only for herself.\r\nThis truth filled out for her there the whole experience about to\r\nrelinquish, suffused and coloured it as a picture that she should keep\r\nand that, describe it as she might, no one but herself would ever\r\nreally see. Moreover she had no desire whatever to make Mr. Mudge\r\njealous; there would be no amusement in it, for the amusement she had\r\nlately known had spoiled her for lower pleasures. There were even no\r\nmaterials for it. The odd thing was how she never doubted that,\r\nproperly handled, his passion was poisonable; what had happened was\r\nthat he had cannily selected a partner with no poison to distil. She\r\nread then and there that she should never interest herself in anybody\r\nas to whom some other sentiment, some superior view, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sure\r\nto interfere for him with jealousy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what did you get out of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nhe asked with a concern that was not in the least for his honour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but a good chance to promise him I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forsake him. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none of my customers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it\xe2\x80\x99s for him not to forsake _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he won\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. But I must just keep on as long as he\r\nmay want me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWant you to sit with him in the Park?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may want me for that\xe2\x80\x94but I shan\xe2\x80\x99t. I rather liked it, but once,\r\nunder the circumstances, is enough. I can do better for him in another\r\nmanner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what manner, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cElsewhere?\xe2\x80\x94I _say_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was an ejaculation used also by Captain Everard, but oh with what\r\na different sound! \xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98say\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be said. And\r\nyet you ought perhaps to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I ought. But _what_\xe2\x80\x94up to now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy exactly what I told him. That I\xe2\x80\x99d do anything for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98anything\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mudge\xe2\x80\x99s immediate comment on this statement was to draw from his\r\npocket a crumpled paper containing the remains of half a pound of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csundries.\xe2\x80\x9d These sundries had figured conspicuously in his prospective\r\nsketch of their tour, but it was only at the end of three days that\r\nthey had defined themselves unmistakeably as chocolate-creams. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nanother?\xe2\x80\x94_that_ one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. She had another, but not the one he\r\nindicated, and then he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat took place afterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfterwards?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you do when you had told him you\xe2\x80\x99d do everything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI simply came away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of the Park?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, leaving him there. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t let him follow me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what did you let him do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t let him do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mudge considered an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cThen what did you go there for?\xe2\x80\x9d His\r\ntone was even slightly critical.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know at the time. It was simply to be with him, I\r\nsuppose\xe2\x80\x94just once. He\xe2\x80\x99s in danger, and I wanted him to know I know it.\r\nIt makes meeting him\xe2\x80\x94at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, since it\xe2\x80\x99s that I want to stay on\r\nfor\xe2\x80\x94more interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt makes it mighty interesting for _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mudge freely declared.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet he didn\xe2\x80\x99t follow you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9c_I_ would!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course. That was the way you began, you know. You\xe2\x80\x99re awfully\r\ninferior to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, you\xe2\x80\x99re not inferior to anybody. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a cheek!\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he in danger of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf being found out. He\xe2\x80\x99s in love with a lady\xe2\x80\x94and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t right\xe2\x80\x94and\r\n_I\xe2\x80\x99ve_ found him out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll be a look-out for _me_!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mudge joked. \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean she has a\r\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what she has! They\xe2\x80\x99re in awful danger, but his is the\r\nworst, because he\xe2\x80\x99s in danger from her too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike me from you\xe2\x80\x94the woman _I_ love? If he\xe2\x80\x99s in the same funk as me\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in a worse one. He\xe2\x80\x99s not only afraid of the lady\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid of\r\nother things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mudge selected another chocolate-cream. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m only afraid of\r\none! But how in the world can you help this party?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not at all. But so long as there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t come away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to wait for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mudge enjoyed what was in his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will he give you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do help him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Nothing in all the wide world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what will he give _me_?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mudge enquired. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean for\r\nwaiting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl thought a moment; then she got up to walk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never heard of\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou haven\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe never mention anything. What I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you is just what I\xe2\x80\x99ve found\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Mudge, who had remained on the bench, looked up at her; she often\r\npreferred to be quiet when he proposed to walk, but now that he seemed\r\nto wish to sit she had a desire to move. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you haven\xe2\x80\x99t told me what\r\n_he_ has found out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered her lover. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99d never find _you_, my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer lover, still on his seat, appealed to her in something of the\r\nattitude in which she had last left Captain Everard, but the impression\r\nwas not the same. \xe2\x80\x9cThen where do I come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t come in at all. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the beauty of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and with this\r\nshe turned to mingle with the multitude collected round the band. Mr.\r\nMudge presently overtook her and drew her arm into his own with a quiet\r\nforce that expressed the serenity of possession; in consonance with\r\nwhich it was only when they parted for the night at her door that he\r\nreferred again to what she had told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen him since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince the night in the Park? No, not once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what a cad!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Mudge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not till the end of October that she saw Captain Everard again,\r\nand on that occasion\xe2\x80\x94the only one of all the series on which hindrance\r\nhad been so utter\xe2\x80\x94no communication with him proved possible. She had\r\nmade out even from the cage that it was a charming golden day: a patch\r\nof hazy autumn sunlight lay across the sanded floor and also, higher\r\nup, quickened into brightness a row of ruddy bottled syrups. Work was\r\nslack and the place in general empty; the town, as they said in the\r\ncage, had not waked up, and the feeling of the day likened itself to\r\nsomething than in happier conditions she would have thought of\r\nromantically as Saint Martin\xe2\x80\x99s summer. The counter-clerk had gone to\r\nhis dinner; she herself was busy with arrears of postal jobs, in the\r\nmidst of which she became aware that Captain Everard had apparently\r\nbeen in the shop a minute and that Mr. Buckton had already seized him.\r\n\r\nHe had as usual half a dozen telegrams; and when he saw that she saw\r\nhim and their eyes met he gave, on bowing to her, an exaggerated laugh\r\nin which she read a new consciousness. It was a confession of\r\nawkwardness; it seemed to tell her that of course he knew he ought\r\nbetter to have kept his head, ought to have been clever enough to wait,\r\non some pretext, till he should have found her free. Mr. Buckton was a\r\nlong time with him, and her attention was soon demanded by other\r\nvisitors; so that nothing passed between them but the fulness of their\r\nsilence. The look she took from him was his greeting, and the other one\r\na simple sign of the eyes sent her before going out. The only token\r\nthey exchanged therefore was his tacit assent to her wish that since\r\nthey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t attempt a certain frankness they should attempt nothing\r\nat all. This was her intense preference; she could be as still and cold\r\nas any one when that was the sole solution.\r\n\r\nYet more than any contact hitherto achieved these counted instants\r\nstruck her as marking a step: they were built so\xe2\x80\x94just in the mere\r\nflash\xe2\x80\x94on the recognition of his now definitely knowing what it was she\r\nwould do for him. The \xe2\x80\x9canything, anything\xe2\x80\x9d she had uttered in the Park\r\nwent to and fro between them and under the poked-out china that\r\ninterposed. It had all at last even put on the air of their not needing\r\nnow clumsily to manoeuvre to converse: their former little postal\r\nmake-believes, the intense implications of questions and answers and\r\nchange, had become in the light of the personal fact, of their having\r\nhad their moment, a possibility comparatively poor. It was as if they\r\nhad met for all time\xe2\x80\x94it exerted on their being in presence again an\r\ninfluence so prodigious. When she watched herself, in the memory of\r\nthat night, walk away from him as if she were making an end, she found\r\nsomething too pitiful in the primness of such a gait. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\nprecisely established on the part of each a consciousness that could\r\nend only with death?\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that in spite of this brave margin an irritation,\r\nafter he had gone, remained with her; a sense that presently became one\r\nwith a still sharper hatred of Mr. Buckton, who, on her friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwithdrawal, had retired with the telegrams to the sounder and left her\r\nthe other work. She knew indeed she should have a chance to see them,\r\nwhen she would, on file; and she was divided, as the day went on,\r\nbetween the two impressions of all that was lost and all that was\r\nre-asserted. What beset her above all, and as she had almost never\r\nknown it before, was the desire to bound straight out, to overtake the\r\nautumn afternoon before it passed away for ever and hurry off to the\r\nPark and perhaps be with him there again on a bench. It became for an\r\nhour a fantastic vision with her that he might just have gone to sit\r\nand wait for her. She could almost hear him, through the tick of the\r\nsounder, scatter with his stick, in his impatience, the fallen leaves\r\nof October. Why should such a vision seize her at this particular\r\nmoment with such a shake? There was a time\xe2\x80\x94from four to five\xe2\x80\x94when she\r\ncould have cried with happiness and rage.\r\n\r\nBusiness quickened, it seemed, toward five, as if the town did wake up;\r\nshe had therefore more to do, and she went through it with little sharp\r\nstampings and jerkings: she made the crisp postal-orders fairly snap\r\nwhile she breathed to herself \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the last day\xe2\x80\x94the last day!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\nlast day of what? She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have told. All she knew now was that if\r\nshe _were_ out of the cage she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least have minded, this\r\ntime, its not yet being dark. She would have gone straight toward Park\r\nChambers and have hung about there till no matter when. She would have\r\nwaited, stayed, rung, asked, have gone in, sat on the stairs. What the\r\nday was the last of was probably, to her strained inner sense, the\r\ngroup of golden ones, of any occasion for seeing the hazy sunshine\r\nslant at that angle into the smelly shop, of any range of chances for\r\nhis wishing still to repeat to her the two words she had in the Park\r\nscarcely let him bring out. \xe2\x80\x9cSee here\xe2\x80\x94see here!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the sound of these two\r\nwords had been with her perpetually; but it was in her ears to-day\r\nwithout mercy, with a loudness that grew and grew. What was it they\r\nthen expressed? what was it he had wanted her to see? She seemed,\r\nwhatever it was, perfectly to see it now\xe2\x80\x94to see that if she should just\r\nchuck the whole thing, should have a great and beautiful courage, he\r\nwould somehow make everything up to her. When the clock struck five she\r\nwas on the very point of saying to Mr. Buckton that she was deadly ill\r\nand rapidly getting worse. This announcement was on her lips, and she\r\nhad quite composed the pale hard face she would offer him: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstop\xe2\x80\x94I must go home. If I feel better, later on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nvery sorry, but I _must_ go.\xe2\x80\x9d At that instant Captain Everard once more\r\nstood there, producing in her agitated spirit, by his real presence,\r\nthe strangest, quickest revolution. He stopped her off without knowing\r\nit, and by the time he had been a minute in the shop she felt herself\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThat was from the first minute how she thought of it. There were again\r\nother persons with whom she was occupied, and again the situation could\r\nonly be expressed by their silence. It was expressed, of a truth, in a\r\nlarger phrase than ever yet, for her eyes now spoke to him with a kind\r\nof supplication. \xe2\x80\x9cBe quiet, be quiet!\xe2\x80\x9d they pleaded; and they saw his\r\nown reply: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever you say; I won\xe2\x80\x99t even look at you\xe2\x80\x94see,\r\nsee!\xe2\x80\x9d They kept conveying thus, with the friendliest liberality, that\r\nthey wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look, quite positively wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. What she was to see was\r\nthat he hovered at the other end of the counter, Mr. Buckton\xe2\x80\x99s end, and\r\nsurrendered himself again to that frustration. It quickly proved so\r\ngreat indeed that what she was to see further was how he turned away\r\nbefore he was attended to, and hung off, waiting, smoking, looking\r\nabout the shop; how he went over to Mr. Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s own counter and\r\nappeared to price things, gave in fact presently two or three orders\r\nand put down money, stood there a long time with his back to her,\r\nconsiderately abstaining from any glance round to see if she were free.\r\nIt at last came to pass in this way that he had remained in the shop\r\nlonger than she had ever yet known to do, and that, nevertheless, when\r\nhe did turn about she could see him time himself\xe2\x80\x94she was freshly taken\r\nup\xe2\x80\x94and cross straight to her postal subordinate, whom some one else had\r\nreleased. He had in his hand all this while neither letters nor\r\ntelegrams, and now that he was close to her\xe2\x80\x94for she was close to the\r\ncounter-clerk\xe2\x80\x94it brought her heart into her mouth merely to see him\r\nlook at her neighbour and open his lips. She was too nervous to bear\r\nit. He asked for a Post-Office Guide, and the young man whipped out a\r\nnew one; whereupon he said he wished not to purchase, but only to\r\nconsult one a moment; with which, the copy kept on loan being produced,\r\nhe once more wandered off.\r\n\r\nWhat was he doing to her? What did he want of her? Well, it was just\r\nthe aggravation of his \xe2\x80\x9cSee here!\xe2\x80\x9d She felt at this moment strangely\r\nand portentously afraid of him\xe2\x80\x94had in her ears the hum of a sense that,\r\nshould it come to that kind of tension, she must fly on the spot to\r\nChalk Farm. Mixed with her dread and with her reflexion was the idea\r\nthat, if he wanted her so much as he seemed to show, it might be after\r\nall simply to do for him the \xe2\x80\x9canything\xe2\x80\x9d she had promised, the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ceverything\xe2\x80\x9d she had thought it so fine to bring out to Mr. Mudge. He\r\nmight want her to help him, might have some particular appeal; though\r\nindeed his manner didn\xe2\x80\x99t denote that\xe2\x80\x94denoted on the contrary an\r\nembarrassment, an indecision, something of a desire not so much to be\r\nhelped as to be treated rather more nicely than she had treated him the\r\nother time. Yes, he considered quite probably that he had help rather\r\nto offer than to ask for. Still, none the less, when he again saw her\r\nfree he continued to keep away from her; when he came back with his\r\n_Guide_ it was Mr. Buckton he caught\xe2\x80\x94it was from Mr. Buckton he\r\nobtained half-a-crown\xe2\x80\x99s-worth of stamps.\r\n\r\nAfter asking for the stamps he asked, quite as a second thought, for a\r\npostal-order for ten shillings. What did he want with so many stamps\r\nwhen he wrote so few letters? How could he enclose a postal-order in a\r\ntelegram? She expected him, the next thing, to go into the corner and\r\nmake up one of his telegrams\xe2\x80\x94half a dozen of them\xe2\x80\x94on purpose to prolong\r\nhis presence. She had so completely stopped looking at him that she\r\ncould only guess his movements\xe2\x80\x94guess even where his eyes rested.\r\nFinally she saw him make a dash that might have been toward the nook\r\nwhere the forms were hung; and at this she suddenly felt that she\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep it up. The counter-clerk had just taken a telegram from a\r\nslavey, and, to give herself something to cover her, she snatched it\r\nout of his hand. The gesture was so violent that he gave her in return\r\nan odd look, and she also perceived that Mr. Buckton noticed it. The\r\nlatter personage, with a quick stare at her, appeared for an instant to\r\nwonder whether his snatching it in _his_ turn mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be the thing she\r\nwould least like, and she anticipated this practical criticism by the\r\nfrankest glare she had ever given him. It sufficed: this time it\r\nparalysed him; and she sought with her trophy the refuge of the\r\nsounder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was repeated the next day; it went on for three days; and at the end\r\nof that time she knew what to think. When, at the beginning, she had\r\nemerged from her temporary shelter Captain Everard had quitted the\r\nshop; and he had not come again that evening, as it had struck her he\r\npossibly might\xe2\x80\x94might all the more easily that there were numberless\r\npersons who came, morning and afternoon, numberless times, so that he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily have attracted attention. The second day it was\r\ndifferent and yet on the whole worse. His access to her had become\r\npossible\xe2\x80\x94she felt herself even reaping the fruit of her yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nglare at Mr. Buckton; but transacting his business with him didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsimplify\xe2\x80\x94it could, in spite of the rigour of circumstance, feed so her\r\nnew conviction. The rigour was tremendous, and his telegrams\xe2\x80\x94not now\r\nmere pretexts for getting at her\xe2\x80\x94were apparently genuine; yet the\r\nconviction had taken but a night to develop. It could be simply enough\r\nexpressed; she had had the glimmer of it the day before in her idea\r\nthat he needed no more help than she had already given; that it was\r\nhelp he himself was prepared to render. He had come up to town but for\r\nthree or four days; he had been absolutely obliged to be absent after\r\nthe other time; yet he would, now that he was face to face with her,\r\nstay on as much longer as she liked. Little by little it was thus\r\nclarified, though from the first flash of his re-appearance she had\r\nread into it the real essence.\r\n\r\nThat was what the night before, at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, her hour to go, had\r\nmade her hang back and dawdle. She did last things or pretended to do\r\nthem; to be in the cage had suddenly become her safety, and she was\r\nliterally afraid of the alternate self who might be waiting outside.\r\n_He_ might be waiting; it was he who was her alternate self, and of him\r\nshe was afraid. The most extraordinary change had taken place in her\r\nfrom the moment of her catching the impression he seemed to have\r\nreturned on purpose to give her. Just before she had done so, on that\r\nbewitched afternoon, she had seen herself approach without a scruple\r\nthe porter at Park Chambers; then as the effect of the rush of a\r\nconsciousness quite altered she had on at last quitting Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, gone\r\nstraight home for the first time since her return from Bournemouth. She\r\nhad passed his door every night for weeks, but nothing would have\r\ninduced her to pass it now. This change was the tribute of her fear\xe2\x80\x94the\r\nresult of a change in himself as to which she needed no more\r\nexplanation than his mere face vividly gave her; strange though it was\r\nto find an element of deterrence in the object that she regarded as the\r\nmost beautiful in the world. He had taken it from her in the Park that\r\nnight that she wanted him not to propose to her to sup; but he had put\r\naway the lesson by this time\xe2\x80\x94he practically proposed supper every time\r\nhe looked at her. This was what, for that matter, mainly filled the\r\nthree days. He came in twice on each of these, and it was as if he came\r\nin to give her a chance to relent. That was after all, she said to\r\nherself in the intervals, the most that he did. There were ways, she\r\nfully recognised, in which he spared her, and other particular ways as\r\nto which she meant that her silence should be full to him of exquisite\r\npleading. The most particular of all was his not being outside, at the\r\ncorner, when she quitted the place for the night. This he might so\r\neasily have been\xe2\x80\x94so easily if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been so nice. She continued to\r\nrecognise in his forbearance the fruit of her dumb supplication, and\r\nthe only compensation he found for it was the harmless freedom of being\r\nable to appear to say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m in town only for three or four days,\r\nbut, you know, I _would_ stay on.\xe2\x80\x9d He struck her as calling attention\r\neach day, each hour, to the rapid ebb of time; he exaggerated to the\r\npoint of putting it that there were only two days more, that there was\r\nat last, dreadfully, only one.\r\n\r\nThere were other things still that he struck her as doing with a\r\nspecial intention; as to the most marked of which\xe2\x80\x94unless indeed it were\r\nthe most obscure\xe2\x80\x94she might well have marvelled that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to\r\nher more horrid. It was either the frenzy of her imagination or the\r\ndisorder of his baffled passion that gave her once or twice the vision\r\nof his putting down redundant money\xe2\x80\x94sovereigns not concerned with the\r\nlittle payments he was perpetually making\xe2\x80\x94so that she might give him\r\nsome sign of helping him to slip them over to her. What was most\r\nextraordinary in this impression was the amount of excuse that, with\r\nsome incoherence, she found for him. He wanted to pay her because there\r\nwas nothing to pay her for. He wanted to offer her things he knew she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take. He wanted to show her how much he respected her by\r\ngiving her the supreme chance to show _him_ she was respectable. Over\r\nthe dryest transactions, at any rate, their eyes had out these\r\nquestions. On the third day he put in a telegram that had evidently\r\nsomething of the same point as the stray sovereigns\xe2\x80\x94a message that was\r\nin the first place concocted and that on a second thought he took back\r\nfrom her before she had stamped it. He had given her time to read it\r\nand had only then bethought himself that he had better not send it. If\r\nit was not to Lady Bradeen at Twindle\xe2\x80\x94where she knew her ladyship then\r\nto be\xe2\x80\x94this was because an address to Doctor Buzzard at Brickwood was\r\njust as good, with the added merit of its not giving away quite so much\r\na person whom he had still, after all, in a manner to consider. It was\r\nof course most complicated, only half lighted; but there was,\r\ndiscernibly enough, a scheme of communication in which Lady Bradeen at\r\nTwindle and Dr. Buzzard at Brickwood were, within limits, one and the\r\nsame person. The words he had shown her and then taken back consisted,\r\nat all events, of the brief but vivid phrase \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThe point was not that she should transmit it; the point was just that\r\nshe should see it. What was absolutely impossible was that before he\r\nhad setted something at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s he should go either to Twindle or to\r\nBrickwood.\r\n\r\nThe logic of this, in turn, for herself, was that she could lend\r\nherself to no settlement so long as she so intensely knew. What she\r\nknew was that he was, almost under peril of life, clenched in a\r\nsituation: therefore how could she also know where a poor girl in the\r\nP.O. might really stand? It was more and more between them that if he\r\nmight convey to her he was free, with all the impossible locked away\r\ninto a closed chapter, her own case might become different for her, she\r\nmight understand and meet him and listen. But he could convey nothing\r\nof the sort, and he only fidgeted and floundered in his want of power.\r\nThe chapter wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the least closed, not for the other party; and\r\nthe other party had a pull, somehow and somewhere: this his whole\r\nattitude and expression confessed, at the same time that they entreated\r\nher not to remember and not to mind. So long as she did remember and\r\ndid mind he could only circle about and go and come, doing futile\r\nthings of which he was ashamed. He was ashamed of his two words to Dr.\r\nBuzzard; he went out of the shop as soon as he had crumpled up the\r\npaper again and thrust it into his pocket. It had been an abject little\r\nexposure of dreadful impossible passion. He appeared in fact to be too\r\nashamed to come back. He had once more left town, and a first week\r\nelapsed, and a second. He had had naturally to return to the real\r\nmistress of his fate; she had insisted\xe2\x80\x94she knew how to insist, and he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put in another hour. There was always a day when she called\r\ntime. It was known to our young friend moreover that he had now been\r\ndispatching telegrams from other offices. She knew at last so much that\r\nshe had quite lost her earlier sense of merely guessing. There were no\r\ndifferent shades of distinctness\xe2\x80\x94it all bounced out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEighteen days elapsed, and she had begun to think it probable she\r\nshould never see him again. He too then understood now: he had made out\r\nthat she had secrets and reasons and impediments, that even a poor girl\r\nat the P.O. might have her complications. With the charm she had cast\r\non him lightened by distance he had suffered a final delicacy to speak\r\nto him, had made up his mind that it would be only decent to let her\r\nalone. Never so much as during these latter days had she felt the\r\nprecariousness of their relation\xe2\x80\x94the happy beautiful untroubled\r\noriginal one, if it could only have been restored\xe2\x80\x94in which the public\r\nservant and the casual public only were concerned. It hung at the best\r\nby the merest silken thread, which was at the mercy of any accident and\r\nmight snap at any minute. She arrived by the end of the fortnight at\r\nthe highest sense of actual fitness, never doubting that her decision\r\nwas now complete. She would just give him a few days more to come back\r\nto her on a proper impersonal basis\xe2\x80\x94for even to an embarrassing\r\nrepresentative of the casual public a public servant with a conscience\r\ndid owe something\xe2\x80\x94and then would signify to Mr. Mudge that she was\r\nready for the little home. It had been visited, in the further talk she\r\nhad had with him at Bournemouth, from garret to cellar, and they had\r\nespecially lingered, with their respectively darkened brows, before the\r\nniche into which it was to be broached to her mother that she must find\r\nmeans to fit.\r\n\r\nHe had put it to her more definitely than before that his calculations\r\nhad allowed for that dingy presence, and he had thereby marked the\r\ngreatest impression he had ever made on her. It was a stroke superior\r\neven again to his handling of the drunken soldier. What she considered\r\nthat in the face of it she hung on at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s for was something she\r\ncould only have described as the common fairness of a last word. Her\r\nactual last word had been, till it should be superseded, that she\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forsake her other friend, and it stuck to her through thick\r\nand thin that she was still at her post and on her honour. This other\r\nfriend had shown so much beauty of conduct already that he would surely\r\nafter all just re-appear long enough to relieve her, to give her\r\nsomething she could take away. She saw it, caught it, at times, his\r\nparting present; and there were moments when she felt herself sitting\r\nlike a beggar with a hand held out to almsgiver who only fumbled. She\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken the sovereigns, but she _would_ take the penny. She heard,\r\nin imagination, on the counter, the ring of the copper. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put\r\nyourself out any longer,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cfor so bad a case. You\xe2\x80\x99ve done\r\nall there is to be done. I thank and acquit and release you. Our lives\r\ntake us. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much\xe2\x80\x94though I\xe2\x80\x99ve really been interested\xe2\x80\x94about\r\nyours, but I suppose you\xe2\x80\x99ve got one. Mine at any rate will take\r\n_me_\xe2\x80\x94and where it will. Heigh-ho! Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d And then once more, for\r\nthe sweetest faintest flower of all: \xe2\x80\x9cOnly, I say\xe2\x80\x94see here!\xe2\x80\x9d She had\r\nframed the whole picture with a squareness that included also the image\r\nof how again she would decline to \xe2\x80\x9csee there,\xe2\x80\x9d decline, as she might\r\nsay, to see anywhere, see anything. Yet it befell that just in the fury\r\nof this escape she saw more than ever.\r\n\r\nHe came back one night with a rush, near the moment of their closing,\r\nand showed her a face so different and new, so upset and anxious, that\r\nalmost anything seemed to look out of it but clear recognition. He\r\npoked in a telegram very much as if the simple sense of pressure, the\r\ndistress of extreme haste, had blurred the remembrance of where in\r\nparticular he was. But as she met his eyes a light came; it broke\r\nindeed on the spot into a positive conscious glare. That made up for\r\neverything, since it was an instant proclamation of the celebrated\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cdanger\xe2\x80\x9d; it seemed to pour things out in a flood. \xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, here it\r\nis\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s upon me at last! Forget, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, my having worried or\r\nbored you, and just help me, just _save_ me, by getting this off\r\nwithout the loss of a second!\xe2\x80\x9d Something grave had clearly occurred, a\r\ncrisis declared itself. She recognised immediately the person to whom\r\nthe telegram was addressed\xe2\x80\x94the Miss Dolman of Parade Lodge to whom Lady\r\nBradeen had wired, at Dover, on the last occasion, and whom she had\r\nthen, with her recollection of previous arrangements, fitted into a\r\nparticular setting. Miss Dolman had figured before and not figured\r\nsince, but she was now the subject of an imperative appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely\r\nnecessary to see you. Take last train Victoria if you can catch it. If\r\nnot, earliest morning, and answer me direct either way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReply paid?\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl. Mr. Buckton had just departed and the\r\ncounter-clerk was at the sounder. There was no other representative of\r\nthe public, and she had never yet, as it seemed to her, not even in the\r\nstreet or in the Park, been so alone with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, reply paid, and as sharp as possible, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe affixed the stamps in a flash. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99ll catch the train!\xe2\x80\x9d she then\r\ndeclared to him breathlessly, as if she could absolutely guarantee it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know\xe2\x80\x94I hope so. It\xe2\x80\x99s awfully important. So kind of you.\r\nAwfully sharp, please.\xe2\x80\x9d It was wonderfully innocent now, his oblivion\r\nof all but his danger. Anything else that had ever passed between them\r\nwas utterly out of it. Well, she had wanted him to be impersonal!\r\n\r\nThere was less of the same need therefore, happily, for herself; yet\r\nshe only took time, before she flew to the sounder, to gasp at him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x98re in trouble?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorrid, horrid\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s a row!\xe2\x80\x9d But they parted, on it, in the next\r\nbreath; and as she dashed at the sounder, almost pushing, in her\r\nviolence, the counter-clerk off the stool, she caught the bang with\r\nwhich, at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s door, in his further precipitation, he closed the\r\napron of the cab into which he had leaped. As he rebounded to some\r\nother precaution suggested by his alarm, his appeal to Miss Dolman\r\nflashed straight away.\r\n\r\nBut she had not, on the morrow, been in the place five minutes before\r\nhe was with her again, still more discomposed and quite, now, as she\r\nsaid to herself, like a frightened child coming to its mother. Her\r\ncompanions were there, and she felt it to be remarkable how, in the\r\npresence of his agitation, his mere scared exposed nature, she suddenly\r\nceased to mind. It came to her as it had never come to her before that\r\nwith absolute directness and assurance they might carry almost anything\r\noff. He had nothing to send\xe2\x80\x94she was sure he had been wiring all\r\nover\xe2\x80\x94and yet his business was evidently huge. There was nothing but\r\nthat in his eyes\xe2\x80\x94not a glimmer of reference or memory. He was almost\r\nhaggard with anxiety and had clearly not slept a wink. Her pity for him\r\nwould have given her any courage, and she seemed to know at last why\r\nshe had been such a fool. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t come?\xe2\x80\x9d she panted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, she came; but there has been some mistake. We want a\r\ntelegram.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne that was sent from here ever so long ago. There was something in\r\nit that has to be recovered. Something very, very important, please\xe2\x80\x94we\r\nwant it immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe really spoke to her as if she had been some strange young woman at\r\nKnightsbridge or Paddington; but it had no other effect on her than to\r\ngive her the measure of his tremendous flurry. Then it was that, above\r\nall, she felt how much she had missed in the gaps and blanks and absent\r\nanswers\xe2\x80\x94how much she had had to dispense with: it was now black\r\ndarkness save for this little wild red flare. So much as that she saw,\r\nso much her mind dealt with. One of the lovers was quaking somewhere\r\nout of town, and the other was quaking just where he stood. This was\r\nvivid enough, and after an instant she knew it was all she wanted. She\r\nwanted no detail, no fact\xe2\x80\x94she wanted no nearer vision of discovery or\r\nshame. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen was your telegram? Do you mean you sent it from here?\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ntried to do the young woman at Knightsbridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, from here\xe2\x80\x94several weeks ago. Five, six, seven\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he was confused\r\nand impatient\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember?\xe2\x80\x9d she could scarcely keep out of her face, at the word, the\r\nstrangest of smiles.\r\n\r\nBut the way he didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch what it meant was perhaps even stranger\r\nstill. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, don\xe2\x80\x99t you keep the old ones?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor a certain time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe thought; she _must_ do the young woman, and she knew exactly what\r\nthe young woman would say and, still more, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you give me\r\nthe date?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh God, no! It was some time or other in August\xe2\x80\x94toward the end. It was\r\nto the same address as the one I gave you last night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl, knowing at this the deepest thrill she had ever\r\nfelt. It came to her there, with her eyes on his face, that she held\r\nthe whole thing in her hand, held it as she held her pencil, which\r\nmight have broken at that instant in her tightened grip. This made her\r\nfeel like the very fountain of fate, but the emotion was such a flood\r\nthat she had to press it back with all her force. That was positively\r\nthe reason, again, of her flute-like Paddington tone. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nus anything a little nearer?\xe2\x80\x9d Her \xe2\x80\x9clittle\xe2\x80\x9d and her \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d came straight\r\nfrom Paddington. These things were no false note for him\xe2\x80\x94his difficulty\r\nabsorbed them all. The eyes with which he pressed her, and in the\r\ndepths of which she read terror and rage and literal tears, were just\r\nthe same he would have shown any other prim person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the date. I only know the thing went from here, and just\r\nabout the time I speak of. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t delivered, you see. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to\r\nrecover it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was as struck with the beauty of his plural pronoun as she had\r\njudged he might be with that of her own; but she knew now so well what\r\nshe was about that she could almost play with him and with her new-born\r\njoy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say \xe2\x80\x98about the time you speak of.\xe2\x80\x99 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nspeak of an exact time\xe2\x80\x94_do_ you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked splendidly helpless. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I want to find out.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you keep the old ones?\xe2\x80\x94can\xe2\x80\x99t you look it up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur young lady\xe2\x80\x94still at Paddington\xe2\x80\x94turned the question over. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndelivered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it _was_; yet, at the same time, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\njust hung back, but he brought it out. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean it was intercepted,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you know? and there was something in it.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused again and, as\r\nif to further his quest and woo and supplicate success and recovery,\r\neven smiled with an effort at the agreeable that was almost ghastly and\r\nthat turned the knife in her tenderness. What must be the pain of it\r\nall, of the open gulf and the throbbing fever, when this was the mere\r\nhot breath? \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to get what was in it\xe2\x80\x94to know what it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see\xe2\x80\x94I see.\xe2\x80\x9d She managed just the accent they had at Paddington when\r\nthey stared like dead fish. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have no clue?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve the clue I\xe2\x80\x99ve just given you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the last of August?\xe2\x80\x9d If she kept it up long enough she would make\r\nhim really angry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and the address, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh the same as last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe visibly quivered, as with a gleam of hope; but it only poured oil on\r\nher quietude, and she was still deliberate. She ranged some papers.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you look?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember your coming,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.\r\n\r\nHe blinked with a new uneasiness; it might have begun to come to him,\r\nthrough her difference, that he was somehow different himself. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwere much quicker then, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo were you\xe2\x80\x94you must do me that justice,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered with a smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut let me see. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it Dover?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Dolman\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParade Lodge, Parade Terrace?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly\xe2\x80\x94thank you so awfully much!\xe2\x80\x9d He began to hope again. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you\r\n_have_ it\xe2\x80\x94the other one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe hesitated afresh; she quite dangled him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was brought by a\r\nlady?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and she put in by mistake something wrong. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nto get hold of!\xe2\x80\x9d Heavens, what was he going to say?\xe2\x80\x94flooding poor\r\nPaddington with wild betrayals! She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t too much, for her joy,\r\ndangle him, yet she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t either, for his dignity, warn or control\r\nor check him. What she found herself doing was just to treat herself to\r\nthe middle way. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was intercepted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt fell into the wrong hands. But there\xe2\x80\x99s something in it,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ncontinued to blurt out, \xe2\x80\x9cthat _may_ be all right. That is, if it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwrong, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know? It\xe2\x80\x99s all right if it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarkably\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nWhat _was_ he, on earth, going to say? Mr. Buckton and the\r\ncounter-clerk were already interested; no one _would_ have the decency\r\nto come in; and she was divided between her particular terror for him\r\nand her general curiosity. Yet she already saw with what brilliancy she\r\ncould add, to carry the thing off, a little false knowledge to all her\r\nreal. \xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with benevolent, with almost\r\npatronising quickness. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lady has forgotten what she did put.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgotten most wretchedly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an immense inconvenience. It has\r\nonly just been found that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t get there; so that if we could\r\nimmediately have it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmediately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery minute counts. You _have_,\xe2\x80\x9d he pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9csurely got them on\r\nfile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that you can see it on the spot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, please\xe2\x80\x94this very minute.\xe2\x80\x9d The counter rang with his knuckles,\r\nwith the knob of his stick, with his panic of alarm. \xe2\x80\x9cDo, _do_ hunt it\r\nup!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say we could get it for you,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl weetly returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet it?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94he looked aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProbably by to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it isn\xe2\x80\x99t here?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his face was pitiful.\r\n\r\nShe caught only the uncovered gleams that peeped out of the blackness,\r\nand she wondered what complication, even among the most supposable, the\r\nvery worst, could be bad enough to account for the degree of his\r\nterror. There were twists and turns, there were places where the screw\r\ndrew blood, that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t guess. She was more and more glad she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been sent on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how do you know if you don\xe2\x80\x99t look?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gave him a smile that was meant to be, in the absolute irony of its\r\npropriety, quite divine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was August 23rd, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing later\r\nhere than August 27th.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething leaped into his face. \xe2\x80\x9c27th\xe2\x80\x9423rd? Then you\xe2\x80\x99re sure? You\r\nknow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe felt she scarce knew what\xe2\x80\x94as if she might soon be pounced upon for\r\nsome lurid connexion with a scandal. It was the queerest of all\r\nsensations, for she had heard, she had read, of these things, and the\r\nwealth of her intimacy with them at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s might be supposed to have\r\nschooled and seasoned her. This particular one that she had really\r\nquite lived with was, after all, an old story; yet what it had been\r\nbefore was dim and distant beside the touch under which she now winced.\r\nScandal?\xe2\x80\x94it had never been but a silly word. Now it was a great tense\r\nsurface, and the surface was somehow Captain Everard\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful face.\r\nDeep down in his eyes a picture, a scene\xe2\x80\x94a great place like a chamber\r\nof justice, where, before a watching crowd, a poor girl, exposed but\r\nheroic, swore with a quavering voice to a document, proved an _alibi_,\r\nsupplied a link. In this picture she bravely took her place. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was\r\nthe 23rd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen can\xe2\x80\x99t you get it this morning\xe2\x80\x94or some time to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe considered, still holding him with her look, which she then turned\r\non her two companions, who were by this time unreservedly enlisted. She\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94not a scrap, and she glanced about for a piece of paper.\r\nWith this she had to recognise the rigour of official thrift\xe2\x80\x94a morsel\r\nof blackened blotter was the only loose paper to be seen. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you got\r\na card?\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her visitor. He was quite away from Paddington\r\nnow, and the next instant, pocket-book in hand, he had whipped a card\r\nout. She gave no glance at the name on it\xe2\x80\x94only turned it to the other\r\nside. She continued to hold him, she felt at present, as she had never\r\nheld him; and her command of her colleagues was for the moment not less\r\nmarked. She wrote something on the back of the card and pushed it\r\nacross to him.\r\n\r\nHe fairly glared at it. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven, nine, four\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNine, six, one\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she obligingly completed the number. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it right?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe smiled.\r\n\r\nHe took the whole thing in with a flushed intensity; then there broke\r\nout in him a visibility of relief that was simply a tremendous\r\nexposure. He shone at them all like a tall lighthouse, embracing even,\r\nfor sympathy, the blinking young men. \xe2\x80\x9cBy all the powers\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAnd without another look, without a word of thanks, without time for\r\nanything or anybody, he turned on them the broad back of his great\r\nstature, straightened his triumphant shoulders, and strode out of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nShe was left confronted with her habitual critics. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall right!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d she extravagantly quoted to them.\r\n\r\nThe counter-clerk was really awe-stricken. \xe2\x80\x9cBut how did you know,\r\ndear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remembered, love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Buckton, on the contrary, was rude. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what game is that, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo happiness she had ever known came within miles of it, and some\r\nminutes elapsed before she could recall herself sufficiently to reply\r\nthat it was none of his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf life at Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s, with the dreadful drop of August, had lost\r\nsomething of its savour, she had not been slow to infer that a heavier\r\nblight had fallen on the graceful industry of Mrs. Jordan.\r\n\r\nWith Lord Rye and Lady Ventnor and Mrs. Bubb all out of town, with the\r\nblinds down on all the homes of luxury, this ingenious woman might well\r\nhave found her wonderful taste left quite on her hands. She bore up,\r\nhowever, in a way that began by exciting much of her young friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nesteem; they perhaps even more frequently met as the wine of life\r\nflowed less free from other sources, and each, in the lack of better\r\ndiversion, carried on with more mystification for the other an\r\nintercourse that consisted not a little in peeping out and drawing\r\nback. Each waited for the other to commit herself, each profusely\r\ncurtained for the other the limits of low horizons. Mrs. Jordan was\r\nindeed probably the more reckless skirmisher; nothing could exceed her\r\nfrequent incoherence unless it was indeed her occasional bursts of\r\nconfidence. Her account of her private affairs rose and fell like a\r\nflame in the wind\xe2\x80\x94sometimes the bravest bonfire and sometimes a handful\r\nof ashes. This our young woman took to be an effect of the position, at\r\none moment and another, of the famous door of the great world. She had\r\nbeen struck in one of her ha\xe2\x80\x99penny volumes with the translation of a\r\nFrench proverb according to which such a door, any door, had to be\r\neither open or shut; and it seemed part of the precariousness of Mrs.\r\nJordan\xe2\x80\x99s life that hers mostly managed to be neither. There had been\r\noccasions when it appeared to gape wide\xe2\x80\x94fairly to woo her across its\r\nthreshold; there had been others, of an order distinctly disconcerting,\r\nwhen it was all but banged in her face. On the whole, however, she had\r\nevidently not lost heart; these still belonged to the class of things\r\nin spite of which she looked well. She intimated that the profits of\r\nher trade had swollen so as to float her through any state of the tide,\r\nand she had, besides this, a hundred profundities and explanations.\r\n\r\nShe rose superior, above all, on the happy fact that there were always\r\ngentlemen in town and that gentlemen were her greatest admirers;\r\ngentlemen from the City in especial\xe2\x80\x94as to whom she was full of\r\ninformation about the passion and pride excited in such breasts by the\r\nelements of her charming commerce. The City men _did_, in short, go in\r\nfor flowers. There was a certain type of awfully smart stockbroker\xe2\x80\x94Lord\r\nRye called them Jews and bounders, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t care\xe2\x80\x94whose\r\nextravagance, she more than once threw out, had really, if one had any\r\nconscience, to be forcibly restrained. It was not perhaps a pure love\r\nof beauty: it was a matter of vanity and a sign of business; they\r\nwished to crush their rivals, and that was one of their weapons. Mrs.\r\nJordan\xe2\x80\x99s shrewdness was extreme; she knew in any case her customer\xe2\x80\x94she\r\ndealt, as she said, with all sorts; and it was at the worst a race for\r\nher\xe2\x80\x94a race even in the dull months\xe2\x80\x94from one set of chambers to another.\r\nAnd then, after all, there were also still the ladies; the ladies of\r\nstockbroking circles were perpetually up and down. They were not quite\r\nperhaps Mrs. Bubb or Lady Ventnor; but you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the difference\r\nunless you quarrelled with them, and then you knew it only by their\r\nmaking-up sooner. These ladies formed the branch of her subject on\r\nwhich she most swayed in the breeze; to that degree that her confidant\r\nhad ended with an inference or two tending to banish regret for\r\nopportunities not embraced. There were indeed tea-gowns that Mrs.\r\nJordan described\xe2\x80\x94but tea-gowns were not the whole of respectability,\r\nand it was odd that a clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s widow should sometimes speak as if\r\nshe almost thought so. She came back, it was true, unfailingly to Lord\r\nRye, never, evidently, quite losing sight of him even on the longest\r\nexcursions. That he was kindness itself had become in fact the very\r\nmoral it all pointed\xe2\x80\x94pointed in strange flashes of the poor woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnearsighted eyes. She launched at her young friend portentous looks,\r\nsolemn heralds of some extraordinary communication. The communication\r\nitself, from week to week, hung fire; but it was to the facts over\r\nwhich it hovered that she owed her power of going on. \xe2\x80\x9cThey _are_, in\r\none way _and_ another,\xe2\x80\x9d she often emphasised, \xe2\x80\x9ca tower of strength\xe2\x80\x9d;\r\nand as the allusion was to the aristocracy the girl could quite wonder\r\nwhy, if they were so in \xe2\x80\x9cone way,\xe2\x80\x9d they should require to be so in two.\r\nShe thoroughly knew, however, how many ways Mrs. Jordan counted in. It\r\nall meant simply that her fate was pressing her close. If that fate was\r\nto be sealed at the matrimonial altar it was perhaps not remarkable\r\nthat she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come all at once to the scratch of overwhelming a\r\nmere telegraphist. It would necessarily present to such a person a\r\nprospect of regretful sacrifice. Lord Rye\xe2\x80\x94if it _was_ Lord Rye\xe2\x80\x94wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbe \xe2\x80\x9ckind\xe2\x80\x9d to a nonentity of that sort, even though people quite as good\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon in November they went, by arrangement, to church\r\ntogether; after which\xe2\x80\x94on the inspiration of the moment the arrangement\r\nhad not included it\xe2\x80\x94they proceeded to Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s lodging in the\r\nregion of Maida Vale. She had raved to her friend about her service of\r\npredilection; she was excessively \xe2\x80\x9chigh,\xe2\x80\x9d and had more than once wished\r\nto introduce the girl to the same comfort and privilege. There was a\r\nthick brown fog and Maida Vale tasted of acrid smoke; but they had been\r\nsitting among chants and incense and wonderful music, during which,\r\nthough the effect of such things on her mind was great, our young lady\r\nhad indulged in a series of reflexions but indirectly related to them.\r\nOne of these was the result of Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s having said to her on the\r\nway, and with a certain fine significance, that Lord Rye had been for\r\nsome time in town. She had spoken as if it were a circumstance to which\r\nlittle required to be added\xe2\x80\x94as if the bearing of such an item on her\r\nlife might easily be grasped. Perhaps it was the wonder of whether Lord\r\nRye wished to marry her that made her guest, with thoughts straying to\r\nthat quarter, quite determine that some other nuptials also should take\r\nplace at Saint Julian\xe2\x80\x99s. Mr. Mudge was still an attendant at his\r\nWesleyan chapel, but this was the least of her worries\xe2\x80\x94it had never\r\neven vexed her enough for her to so much as name it to Mrs. Jordan. Mr.\r\nMudge\xe2\x80\x99s form of worship was one of several things\xe2\x80\x94they made up in\r\nsuperiority and beauty for what they wanted in number\xe2\x80\x94that she had long\r\nago settled he should take from her, and she had now moreover for the\r\nfirst time definitely established her own. Its principal feature was\r\nthat it was to be the same as that of Mrs. Jordan and Lord Rye; which\r\nwas indeed very much what she said to her hostess as they sat together\r\nlater on. The brown fog was in this hostess\xe2\x80\x99s little parlour, where it\r\nacted as a postponement of the question of there being, besides,\r\nanything else than the teacups and a pewter pot and a very black little\r\nfire and a paraffin lamp without a shade. There was at any rate no sign\r\nof a flower; it was not for herself Mrs. Jordan gathered sweets. The\r\ngirl waited till they had had a cup of tea\xe2\x80\x94waited for the announcement\r\nthat she fairly believed her friend had, this time, possessed herself\r\nof her formally at last to make; but nothing came, after the interval,\r\nsave a little poke at the fire, which was like the clearing of a throat\r\nfor a speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you must have heard me speak of Mr. Drake?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jordan had\r\nnever looked so queer, nor her smile so suggestive of a large\r\nbenevolent bite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drake? Oh yes; isn\xe2\x80\x99t he a friend of Lord Rye?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA great and trusted friend. Almost\xe2\x80\x94I may say\xe2\x80\x94a loved friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9calmost\xe2\x80\x9d had such an oddity that her companion was moved,\r\nrather flippantly perhaps, to take it up. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t people as good as love\r\ntheir friends when they I trust them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt pulled up a little the eulogist of Mr. Drake. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear, I love\r\n_you_\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t trust me?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl unmercifully asked.\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Jordan paused\xe2\x80\x94still she looked queer. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied\r\nwith a certain austerity; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m about to give you\r\nrather a remarkable proof of.\xe2\x80\x9d The sense of its being remarkable was\r\nalready so strong that, while she bridled a little, this held her\r\nauditor in a momentary muteness of submission. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drake has rendered\r\nhis lordship for several years services that his lordship has highly\r\nappreciated and that make it all the more\xe2\x80\x94a\xe2\x80\x94unexpected that they\r\nshould, perhaps a little suddenly, separate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeparate?\xe2\x80\x9d Our young lady was mystified, but she tried to be\r\ninterested; and she already saw that she had put the saddle on the\r\nwrong horse. She had heard something of Mr. Drake, who was a member of\r\nhis lordship\xe2\x80\x99s circle\xe2\x80\x94the member with whom, apparently, Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\navocations had most happened to throw her. She was only a little\r\npuzzled at the \xe2\x80\x9cseparation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d she smiled, \xe2\x80\x9cif they\r\nseparate as friends\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh his lordship takes the greatest interest in Mr. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s future.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything for him; he has in fact just done a great deal. There\r\n_must_, you know, be changes\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one knows it better than I,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl said. She wished to draw her\r\ninterlocutress out. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be changes enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re leaving Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ornament of that establishment waited a moment to answer, and then\r\nit was indirect. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what _you\xe2\x80\x99re_ doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, what will you think of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy that you\xe2\x80\x99ve found the opening you were always so sure of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan, on this, appeared to muse with embarrassed intensity. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwas always sure, yes\xe2\x80\x94and yet I often wasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99re sure now. Sure, I mean, of Mr. Drake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my dear, I think I may say I _am_. I kept him going till I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen he\xe2\x80\x99s yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy very own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow nice! And awfully rich?\xe2\x80\x9d our young woman went on.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan showed promptly enough that she loved for higher things.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAwfully handsome\xe2\x80\x94six foot two. And he _has_ put by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite like Mr. Mudge, then!\xe2\x80\x9d that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s friend rather\r\ndesperately exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh not _quite!_\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s was ambiguous about it, but the name of\r\nMr. Mudge had evidently given her some sort of stimulus. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\nmore opportunity now, at any rate. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to Lady Bradeen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Lady Bradeen?\xe2\x80\x9d This was bewilderment. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Going\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl had seen, from the way Mrs. Jordan looked at her, that the\r\neffect of the name had been to make her let something out. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe floundered, but she found her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\noften told you that if you\xe2\x80\x99ve grand clients I have them too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jordan; \xe2\x80\x9cbut the great difference is that you hate\r\nyours, whereas I really love mine. _Do_ you know Lady Bradeen?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\npursued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDown to the ground! She\xe2\x80\x99s always in and out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s foolish eyes confessed, in fixing themselves on this\r\nsketch, to a degree of wonder and even of envy. But she bore up and,\r\nwith a certain gaiety, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hate _her_?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded.\r\n\r\nHer visitor\xe2\x80\x99s reply was prompt. \xe2\x80\x9cDear no!\xe2\x80\x94not nearly so much as some of\r\nthem. She\xe2\x80\x99s too outrageously beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan continued to gaze. \xe2\x80\x9cOutrageously?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes; deliciously.\xe2\x80\x9d What was really delicious was Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvagueness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know her\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen her?\xe2\x80\x9d her guest lightly\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a great deal about her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo have I!\xe2\x80\x9d our young lady exclaimed.\r\n\r\nJordan looked an instant as if she suspected her good faith, or at\r\nleast her seriousness. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know some friend\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Lady Bradeen\xe2\x80\x99s? Oh yes\xe2\x80\x94I know one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed out. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly one\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99s so intimate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan just hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he\xe2\x80\x99s not a lady.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer interlocutress appeared to muse. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s immensely surrounded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe _will_ be\xe2\x80\x94with Mr. Drake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s gaze became strangely fixed. \xe2\x80\x9cIs she _very_\r\ngood-looking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe handsomest person I know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan continued to contemplate. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, _I_ know some beauties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nThen with her odd jerkiness: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think she looks _good_?\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause that\xe2\x80\x99s not always the case with the good-looking?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the other\r\ntook it up. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t: that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing Cocker\xe2\x80\x99s has taught\r\nme. Still, there are some people who have everything. Lady Bradeen, at\r\nany rate, has enough: eyes and a nose and a mouth, a complexion, a\r\nfigure\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA figure?\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jordan almost broke in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA figure, a head of hair!\xe2\x80\x9d The girl made a little conscious motion\r\nthat seemed to let the hair all down, and her companion watched the\r\nwonderful show. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Drake _is_ another\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts had to come back from a distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s admirers. He\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98going,\xe2\x80\x99 you say, to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this Mrs. Jordan really faltered. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has engaged him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEngaged him?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94our young woman was quite at sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the same capacity as Lord Rye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was Lord Rye engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan looked away from her now\xe2\x80\x94looked, she thought, rather\r\ninjured and, as if trifled with, even a little angry. The mention of\r\nLady Bradeen had frustrated for a while the convergence of our\r\nheroine\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts; but with this impression of her old friend\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncombined impatience and diffidence they began again to whirl round her,\r\nand continued it till one of them appeared to dart at her, out of the\r\ndance, as if with a sharp peck. It came to her with a lively shock,\r\nwith a positive sting, that Mr. Drake was\xe2\x80\x94could it be possible? With\r\nthe idea she found herself afresh on the edge of laughter, of a sudden\r\nand strange perversity of mirth. Mr. Drake loomed, in a swift image,\r\nbefore her; such a figure as she had seen in open doorways of houses in\r\nCocker\xe2\x80\x99s quarter\xe2\x80\x94majestic, middle-aged, erect, flanked on either side\r\nby a footman and taking the name of a visitor. Mr. Drake then verily\r\n_was_ a person who opened the door! Before she had time, however, to\r\nrecover from the effect of her evocation, she was offered a vision\r\nwhich quite engulfed it. It was communicated to her somehow that the\r\nface with which she had seen it rise prompted Mrs. Jordan to dash, a\r\nbit wildly, at something, at anything, that might attenuate criticism.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLady Bradeen\xe2\x80\x99s re-arranging\xe2\x80\x94she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be married.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMarried?\xe2\x80\x9d The girl echoed it ever so softly, but there it was at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe summoned all her sturdiness. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd her friends\xe2\x80\x94haven\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any of them lately. I\xe2\x80\x99m not so fortunate as _you_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan gathered herself. \xe2\x80\x9cThen you haven\xe2\x80\x99t even heard of Lord\r\nBradeen\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer comrade, unable for a moment to speak, gave a slow headshake. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nknow it from Mr. Drake?\xe2\x80\x9d It was better surely not to learn things at\r\nall than to learn them by the butler.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe tells him everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he tells _you_\xe2\x80\x94I see.\xe2\x80\x9d Our young lady got up; recovering her muff\r\nand her gloves she smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t unfortunately any Mr.\r\nDrake. I congratulate you with all my heart. Even without your sort of\r\nassistance, however, there\xe2\x80\x99s a trifle here and there that I do pick up.\r\nI gather that if she\xe2\x80\x99s to marry any one it must quite necessarily be my\r\nfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan was now also on her feet. \xe2\x80\x9cIs Captain Everard your friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl considered, drawing on a glove. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw, at one time, an\r\nimmense deal of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan looked hard at the glove, but she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t after all waited\r\nfor that to be sorry it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t cleaner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat time was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been the time you were seeing so much of Mr. Drake.\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\nhad now fairly taken it in: the distinguished person Mrs. Jordan was to\r\nmarry would answer bells and put on coals and superintend, at least,\r\nthe cleaning of boots for the other distinguished person whom she\r\nmight\xe2\x80\x94well, whom she might have had, if she had wished, so much more to\r\nsay to. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\xe2\x80\x9d she added; \xe2\x80\x9cgood-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan, however, again taking her muff from her, turned it over,\r\nbrushed it off and thoughtfully peeped into it. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me this before\r\nyou go. You spoke just now of your own changes. Do you mean that Mr.\r\nMudge\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Mudge has had great patience with me\xe2\x80\x94he has brought me at last to\r\nthe point. We\xe2\x80\x99re to be married next month and have a nice little home.\r\nBut he\xe2\x80\x99s only a grocer, you know\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the girl met her friend\xe2\x80\x99s intent\r\neyes\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cso that I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that, with the set you\xe2\x80\x99ve got into, you won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee your way to keep up our friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan for a moment made no answer to this; she only held the muff\r\nup to her face, after which she gave it back. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. I\r\nsee, I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo her guest\xe2\x80\x99s astonishment there were tears now in her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike what?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy my engagement. Only, with your great cleverness,\xe2\x80\x9d the poor lady\r\nquavered out, \xe2\x80\x9cyou put it in your own way. I mean that you\xe2\x80\x99ll cool off.\r\nYou already _have_\xe2\x80\x94!\xe2\x80\x9d And on this, the next instant, her tears began to\r\nflow. She succumbed to them and collapsed; she sank down again, burying\r\nher face and trying to smother her sobs.\r\n\r\nHer young friend stood there, still in some rigour, but taken much by\r\nsurprise even if not yet fully moved to pity. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t put anything in\r\nany \xe2\x80\x98way,\xe2\x80\x99 and I\xe2\x80\x99m very glad you\xe2\x80\x99re suited. Only, you know, you did put\r\nto _me_ so splendidly what, even for me, if I had listened to you, it\r\nmight lead to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan kept up a mild thin weak wail; then, drying her eyes, as\r\nfeebly considered this reminder. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has led to my not starving!\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nfaintly gasped.\r\n\r\nOur young lady, at this, dropped into the place beside her, and now, in\r\na rush, the small silly misery was clear. She took her hand as a sign\r\nof pitying it, then, after another instant, confirmed this expression\r\nwith a consoling kiss. They sat there together; they looked out, hand\r\nin hand, into the damp dusky shabby little room and into the future, of\r\nno such very different suggestion, at last accepted by each. There was\r\nno definite utterance, on either side, of Mr. Drake\xe2\x80\x99s position in the\r\ngreat world, but the temporary collapse of his prospective bride threw\r\nall further necessary light; and what our heroine saw and felt for in\r\nthe whole business was the vivid reflexion of her own dreams and\r\ndelusions and her own return to reality. Reality, for the poor things\r\nthey both were, could only be ugliness and obscurity, could never be\r\nthe escape, the rise. She pressed her friend\xe2\x80\x94she had tact enough for\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x94with no other personal question, brought on no need of further\r\nrevelations, only just continued to hold and comfort her and to\r\nacknowledge by stiff little forbearances the common element in their\r\nfate. She felt indeed magnanimous in such matters; since if it was very\r\nwell, for condolence or reassurance, to suppress just then invidious\r\nshrinkings, she yet by no means saw herself sitting down, as she might\r\nsay, to the same table with Mr. Drake. There would luckily, to all\r\nappearance, be little question of tables; and the circumstance that, on\r\ntheir peculiar lines, her friend\xe2\x80\x99s interests would still attach\r\nthemselves to Mayfair flung over Chalk Farm the first radiance it had\r\nshown. Where was one\xe2\x80\x99s pride and one\xe2\x80\x99s passion when the real way to\r\njudge of one\xe2\x80\x99s luck was by making not the wrong but the right\r\ncomparison? Before she had again gathered herself to go she felt very\r\nsmall and cautious and thankful. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have our own house,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cand you must come very soon and let me show it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_We_ shall have our own too,\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jordan replied; \xe2\x80\x9cfor, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow? he makes it a condition that he sleeps out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA condition?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the girl felt out of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor any new position. It was on that he parted with Lord Rye. His\r\nlordship can\xe2\x80\x99t meet it. So Mr. Drake has given him up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94our young woman put it as cheerfully as possible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor me and Lady Bradeen. Her ladyship\xe2\x80\x99s too glad to get him at any\r\nprice. Lord Rye, out of interest in us, has in fact quite _made_ her\r\ntake him. So, as I tell you, he will have his own establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan, in the elation of it, had begun to revive; but there was\r\nnevertheless between them rather a conscious pause\xe2\x80\x94a pause in which\r\nneither visitor nor hostess brought out a hope or an invitation. It\r\nexpressed in the last resort that, in spite of submission and sympathy,\r\nthey could now after all only look at each other across the social\r\ngulf. They remained together as if it would be indeed their last\r\nchance, still sitting, though awkwardly, quite close, and feeling\r\nalso\xe2\x80\x94and this most unmistakeably\xe2\x80\x94that there was one thing more to go\r\ninto. By the time it came to the surface, moreover, our young friend\r\nhad recognised the whole of the main truth, from which she even drew\r\nagain a slight irritation. It was not the main truth perhaps that most\r\nsignified; but after her momentary effort, her embarrassment and her\r\ntears Mrs. Jordan had begun to sound afresh\xe2\x80\x94and even without\r\nspeaking\xe2\x80\x94the note of a social connexion. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really let go of it\r\nthat she was marrying into society. Well, it was a harmless\r\ncompensation, and it was all the prospective bride of Mr. Mudge had to\r\nleave with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis young lady at last rose again, but she lingered before going. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nhas Captain Everard nothing to say to it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what, dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, to such questions\xe2\x80\x94the domestic arrangements, things in the\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _can_ he, with any authority, when nothing in the house is his?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot his?\xe2\x80\x9d The girl wondered, perfectly conscious of the appearance she\r\nthus conferred on Mrs. Jordan of knowing, in comparison with herself,\r\nso tremendously much about it. Well, there were things she wanted so to\r\nget at that she was willing at last, though it hurt her, to pay for\r\nthem with humiliation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are they not his?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know, dear, that he has nothing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing?\xe2\x80\x9d It was hard to see him in such a light, but Mrs. Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npower to answer for it had a superiority that began, on the spot, to\r\ngrow. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t he rich?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan looked immensely, looked both generally and particularly,\r\ninformed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt depends upon what you call\xe2\x80\x94! Not at any rate in the least\r\nas _she_ is. What does he bring? Think what she has. And then, love,\r\nhis debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis debts?\xe2\x80\x9d His young friend was fairly betrayed into helpless\r\ninnocence. She could struggle a little, but she had to let herself go;\r\nand if she had spoken frankly she would have said: \xe2\x80\x9cDo tell me, for I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know so much about him as _that_!\xe2\x80\x9d As she didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak frankly\r\nshe only said: \xe2\x80\x9cHis debts are nothing\xe2\x80\x94when she so adores him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan began to fix her again, and now she saw that she must only\r\ntake it all. That was what it had come to: his having sat with her\r\nthere on the bench and under the trees in the summer darkness and put\r\nhis hand on her, making her know what he would have said if permitted;\r\nhis having returned to her afterwards, repeatedly, with supplicating\r\neyes and a fever in his blood; and her having, on her side, hard and\r\npedantic, helped by some miracle and with her impossible condition,\r\nonly answered him, yet supplicating back, through the bars of the\r\ncage,\xe2\x80\x94all simply that she might hear of him, now for ever lost, only\r\nthrough Mrs. Jordan, who touched him through Mr. Drake, who reached him\r\nthrough Lady Bradeen. \xe2\x80\x9cShe adores him\xe2\x80\x94but of course that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all\r\nthere was about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl met her eyes a minute, then quite surrendered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was there\r\nelse about it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Mrs. Jordan was almost compassionate.\r\n\r\nHer interlocutress had, in the cage, sounded depths, but there was a\r\nsuggestion here somehow of an abyss quite measureless. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I\r\nknow she would never let him alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow _could_ she\xe2\x80\x94fancy!\xe2\x80\x94when he had so compromised her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe most artless cry they had ever uttered broke, at this, from the\r\nyounger pair of lips. \xe2\x80\x9c_Had_ he so\xe2\x80\x94?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know the scandal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur heroine thought, recollected there was something, whatever it was,\r\nthat she knew after all much more of than Mrs. Jordan. She saw him\r\nagain as she had seen him come that morning to recover the telegram\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nsaw him as she had seen him leave the shop. She perched herself a\r\nmoment on this. \xe2\x80\x9cOh there was nothing public.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot exactly public\xe2\x80\x94no. But there was an awful scare and an awful row.\r\nIt was all on the very point of coming out. Something was\r\nlost\xe2\x80\x94something was found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes,\xe2\x80\x9d the girl replied, smiling as if with the revival of a blurred\r\nmemory; \xe2\x80\x9csomething was found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt all got about\xe2\x80\x94and there was a point at which Lord Bradeen had to\r\nact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad to\xe2\x80\x94yes. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan was obliged to admit it. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. And then, luckily\r\nfor them, he died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about his death,\xe2\x80\x9d her companion said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was nine weeks ago, and most sudden. It has given them a prompt\r\nchance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo get married?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94this was a wonder\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwithin nine weeks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh not immediately, but\xe2\x80\x94in all the circumstances\xe2\x80\x94very quietly and, I\r\nassure you, very soon. Every preparation\xe2\x80\x99s made. Above all she holds\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh yes, she holds him!\xe2\x80\x9d our young friend threw off. She had this\r\nbefore her again a minute; then she continued: \xe2\x80\x9cYou mean through his\r\nhaving made her talked about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but not only that. She has still another pull.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he was _in_ something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer comrade wondered. \xe2\x80\x9cIn what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Something bad. As I tell you, something was found.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl stared. \xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been very bad for him. But, she helped him some way\xe2\x80\x94she\r\nrecovered it, got hold of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s even said she stole it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOur young woman considered afresh. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy it was what was found that\r\nprecisely saved him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan, however, was positive. \xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. I happen to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer disciple faltered but an instant. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean through Mr. Drake?\r\nDo they tell _him_ these things?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good servant,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Jordan, now thoroughly superior and\r\nproportionately sententious, \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be told! Her ladyship\r\nsaved\xe2\x80\x94as a woman so often saves!\xe2\x80\x94the man she loves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis time our heroine took longer to recover herself, but she found a\r\nvoice at last. \xe2\x80\x9cAh well\xe2\x80\x94of course I don\xe2\x80\x99t know! The great thing was\r\nthat he got off. They seem then, in a manner,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cto have done\r\na great deal for each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s she that has done most. She has him tight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see, I see. Good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d The women had already embraced, and this was\r\nnot repeated; but Mrs. Jordan went down with her guest to the door of\r\nthe house. Here again the younger lingered, reverting, though three or\r\nfour other remarks had on the way passed between them, to Captain\r\nEverard and Lady Bradeen. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you mean just now that if she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsaved him, as you call it, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hold him so tight?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I dare say.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Jordan, on the doorstep, smiled with a\r\nreflexion that had come to her; she took one of her big bites of the\r\nbrown gloom. \xe2\x80\x9cMen always dislike one when they\xe2\x80\x99ve done one an injury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what injury had he done her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned. He _must_ marry her, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd didn\xe2\x80\x99t he want to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot before she recovered the telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Jordan was pulled up a little. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it a telegram?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe girl hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said so. I mean whatever it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, whatever it was, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she saw _that_.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo she just nailed him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe just nailed him.\xe2\x80\x9d The departing friend was now at the bottom of\r\nthe little flight of steps; the other was at the top, with a certain\r\nthickness of fog. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when am I to think of you in your little\r\nhome?\xe2\x80\x94next month?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the voice from the top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the very latest. And when am I to think of you in yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh even sooner. I feel, after so much talk with you about it, as if I\r\nwere already there!\xe2\x80\x9d Then \xe2\x80\x9c_Good_-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d came out of the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-_bye_!\xe2\x80\x9d went into it. Our young lady went into it also, in the\r\nopposed quarter, and presently, after a few sightless turns, came out\r\non the Paddington canal. Distinguishing vaguely what the low parapet\r\nenclosed she stopped close to it and stood a while very intently, but\r\nperhaps still sightlessly, looking down on it. A policeman; while she\r\nremained, strolled past her; then, going his way a little further and\r\nhalf lost in the atmosphere, paused and watched her. But she was quite\r\nunaware\xe2\x80\x94she was full of her thoughts. They were too numerous to find a\r\nplace just here, but two of the number may at least be mentioned. One\r\nof these was that, decidedly, her little home must be not for next\r\nmonth, but for next week; the other, which came indeed as she resumed\r\nher walk and went her way, was that it was strange such a matter should\r\nbe at last settled for her by Mr. Drake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK IN THE CAGE ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1144-0.txt or 1144-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/1/4/1144/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n'
