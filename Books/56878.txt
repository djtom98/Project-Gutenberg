What the author prized in this purely intimate but\r\nbeautifully finished story was its fidelity to actuality; that is to\r\nsay, he prized the personal recollections of early youth. In that\r\nrespect this story has a prominent interest for readers, since it\r\nnarrates--according to the testimony of the author--an actual fact in\r\nhis life, and that without the slightest artificial colouring.[1] To\r\nwhat degree Turg\xc3\xa9nieff\xe2\x80\x99s testimony is credible, remarks one critic, is a\r\nquestion which can be rightly decided only by biographical documents.\r\nFamous writers are particularly inclined by nature to romantic coquetry\r\nwith their own personalities--a characteristic which was, apparently, to\r\nsome extent, inherent in Turg\xc3\xa9nieff, despite his renowned modesty.\r\nFamous writers are fond of leading their contemporaries--and still more\r\nposterity--astray with regard to the reflection of intimate details of\r\ntheir lives in their artistic works.... At any rate, Russian artistic\r\nproductions, in which the authors have endeavoured to set forth\r\nbiographical details, must be scrutinised with extreme cautiousness. The\r\nauthor, while imagining that he is thoroughly sincere, may involuntarily\r\nindulge in inventions concerning himself. But in its literary aspect\r\nthis story indubitably is one of Turg\xc3\xa9nieff\xe2\x80\x99s masterpieces, and in it\r\nthe original character of its chief heroine, Princess Zina\xc3\xadda Zasy\xc3\xa9kin,\r\nis depicted with remarkable clearness and charm.... The artist threw off\r\nthis light and elegant little intimate study by way of relaxation after\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the Eve,\xe2\x80\x9d a romance dealing with a broad social problem, and by way\r\nof preparation for a new work, still more serious in intention, \xe2\x80\x9cFathers\r\nand Children.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst Love\xe2\x80\x9d does not contain any social types, does not deal with any\r\nsocial problems. It consists wholly, so to speak, of poetry. The young\r\nPrincess is one of the author\xe2\x80\x99s most poetical creations. Her character\r\nis depicted with marvellous grace and elegance in the little scenes\r\nwhich exert so great an influence over her sixteen-year-old admirer. In\r\nthis young man\xe2\x80\x99s father Turg\xc3\xa9nieff sketched his own father, who did not\r\nlove his wife, and whose domestic relations were identical with those\r\nhere described. His wife was considerably younger than he, and he had\r\nmarried her for her money, One curious detail concerns the Pole,\r\nMal\xc3\xa9vsky. This \xe2\x80\x9cdubious Count, swindler, and, in general, dirty little\r\ngentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d as one critic expresses it, \xe2\x80\x9cdrawn with great artistic\r\nvivacity, and with unconcealed scorn, is a very typical figure; and such\r\nrepulsive Poles were formerly encountered in great numbers in Holy\r\nRussia,--and are still to be met with. In this character are\r\nconcentrated the unpleasant characteristics of the Polish national\r\ncharacter: spiritual deceitfulness, double-facedness, insignificance,\r\ncourtliness, and a tendency to revolting intrigue.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn \xe2\x80\x9cA Correspondence\xe2\x80\x9d we again encounter one of Turg\xc3\xa9nieff\xe2\x80\x99s favourite\r\ntypes, the superfluous man. But the author has taken a stride in advance\r\nwith Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch. In this case the superfluous man does not blame\r\neither the insipidity of life, or society, or people alone,--he blames\r\nhimself. In M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna\xe2\x80\x99s friend and correspondent we behold a\r\ngood and worthy man, cultured in both mind and heart,--but, like many\r\nothers among Turg\xc3\xa9nieff\xe2\x80\x99s heroes, suffering, so to speak, from a malady\r\nof the will. One critic declares that this story is almost identical, on\r\nits exterior, with \xe2\x80\x9cR\xc3\xbadin.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the Russian representatives of \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nloftiest aspirations\xe2\x80\x9d enters into correspondence with a young girl who,\r\nas people were fond of expressing it at that period, belonged among the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cchoice natures.\xe2\x80\x9d Disillusioned with life, she is ready to submit to\r\nthe conditions which encompass her. Under the influence of an\r\nill-defined impulse of affection and sympathy toward this young girl,\r\nthe hero begins to inflate her sense of being an elect person, and to\r\nstir up her energy to contend with the humdrum circle in which she\r\ndwells. Just at the moment when he has awakened her courage and her hope\r\nthat he will join her in this conflict, he stumbles and falls himself,\r\nin the most pusillanimous manner. His will is ailing.\r\n\r\nAnother point worth noting is that in the heroine\xe2\x80\x99s third letter the\r\nnote of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x99s question\xe2\x80\x9d is sounded with remarkable\r\nfeeling and force.\r\n\r\nThe explanation vouchsafed by one critic for the prevalence of weak men\r\nin Turg\xc3\xa9nieff\xe2\x80\x99s romances, in connection with \xe2\x80\x9cA Correspondence,\xe2\x80\x9d is that\r\nthe author did not depict strong natures simply because he did not find\r\nsuitable material for that purpose in the circle which surrounded him.\r\nHe was determined to draw the best men of his time as he found\r\nthem--that is to say, men addicted to self-conviction, fiery in\r\nlanguage, but weak in resolution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Region of Dead Calm\xe2\x80\x9d was written while Turg\xc3\xa9nieff was forbidden to\r\nleave his estate at Sp\xc3\xa1sskoe-Lutov\xc3\xadnovo, after his release from the\r\nimprisonment wherewith he was punished for having published in Moscow a\r\neulogy of G\xc3\xb3gol which the St. Petersburg censor had prohibited. His\r\nidea that all men are divided into two categories which, respectively,\r\npossess more or less of the characteristics of Hamlet and of Don\r\nQuixote, is illustrated again in this story by V\xc3\xa9retyeff, who ruins his\r\ntalents and his life with liquor.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as one critic says, \xe2\x80\x9cpositively, in the whole of\r\nRussian literature, we do not meet elsewhere such a grand, massive,\r\nsevere, and somewhat coarse woman as M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\xe2\x80\x9d M\xc3\xa1sha is the first\r\nwoman in Russian literature to look upon man as a worker, and to treat\r\nhim with intelligent exaction. Another strange characteristic in a young\r\nlady of the remote country districts is M\xc3\xa1sha\xe2\x80\x99s dislike for \xe2\x80\x9csweet\xe2\x80\x9d\r\npoetry. Her suicide is not a proof that her character was weak. And of\r\nthe two weak men in the story, Ast\xc3\xa1khoff is the weaker, the more\r\ncolourless, in every way--as to character, not as to the author\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportraiture.\r\n\r\nThe pictures of country life among the landed gentry are drawn with\r\ngreat charm and delicate humour.\r\n\r\nThat Turg\xc3\xa9nieff was affected, and very sensibly so, by the lack of\r\ncomprehension evinced by both critics and readers toward his great work\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFathers and Children,\xe2\x80\x9d is evident, in part, from the characteristic\r\nlyrical fragment, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is Enough.\xe2\x80\x9d It is filled with mournful pessimism\r\nof a romantic sort, which strongly recalls the pessimism of Leopardi. A\r\ncertain element of comedy is imparted to this sentimental outpouring by\r\nthe fact that the author fancied (and, probably, with entire sincerity)\r\nthat he bore a strong resemblance in his convictions to Baz\xc3\xa1roff, his\r\ncreation. Dostoi\xc3\xa9vsky depicted this comic element very caustically, in\r\nthe most malicious of parodies on Turg\xc3\xa9nieff in general and on \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\nEnough\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPhantoms\xe2\x80\x9d in particular. This parody is contained in his\r\nromance \xe2\x80\x9cDevils,\xe2\x80\x9d and constitutes one of the most venomous pages in that\r\ndecidedly venomous romance. The following is an excerpt: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the\r\nmeantime, the mist swirled and swirled, and swirled round and round\r\nuntil it bore more resemblance to a million pillows than to mist. And\r\nsuddenly everything vanishes, and a great Genius crosses the Volga in\r\nwinter, during a thaw. Two and a half pages about this transit. But,\r\nnotwithstanding, he tumbles into a hole in the ice. The Genius goes to\r\nthe bottom. Do you think he drowns? Not a bit of it! All this is for the\r\nsake, after he is completely foundered and is beginning to choke, of\r\nmaking a block of ice, a tiny block, about the size of a pea, but clear\r\nand transparent, float past him \xe2\x80\x98like a frozen tear\xe2\x80\x99; and on that block\r\nof ice Germany, or, to put it more accurately, the sky of Germany, is\r\nreflected; and by the rainbow play of that reflection it reminds him of\r\nthe tear which--dost thou remember?--trickled from thine eyes when we\r\nsat under the emerald tree, and thou didst joyfully exclaim: \xe2\x80\x98There is\r\nno crime!\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98Yes!\xe2\x80\x99 said I through my tears; \xe2\x80\x98but if that is so, then\r\nassuredly there are no righteous men either.\xe2\x80\x99 We fell to sobbing and\r\nparted forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Dog\xe2\x80\x9d was first published in the feuilleton of the _Petersburg\r\nNews_, No. 85, 1865. It is generally admitted to be one of Turg\xc3\xa9nieff\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nweak and unsuccessful works. But one critic describes how enthralling it\r\nwas when the author narrated it (in advance of publication) to a group\r\nof friends in Moscow, and what a deep impression it made upon them.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I read it afterward in print,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cit seemed to me a pale\r\ncopy of Turg\xc3\xa9nieff\xe2\x80\x99s verbal narration. One was impressed with the idea\r\nthat, when he sat down to write it, he was overcome with apprehension\r\nlest his readers and critics should suppose that he believed in this\r\nmysterious adventure. But conviction on the part of the author--in\r\nappearance at least--is precisely what is required in such cases. He\r\ntold the tale with enthusiasm, and even turned pale, and his face\r\nassumed a cast of fear at the dramatic points.\xe2\x80\x9d The critic adds that he\r\ncould not get to sleep for hours afterward.\r\n\r\nI.

The clock struck half-past twelve.\r\nThere remained in the room only the host, Sergy\xc3\xa9i Nikol\xc3\xa1evitch, and\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Petr\xc3\xb3vitch.\r\n\r\nThe host rang and ordered the remains of the supper to be removed.--\xe2\x80\x9cSo\r\nthen, the matter is settled,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said, ensconcing himself more deeply\r\nin his arm-chair, and lighting a cigar:--\xe2\x80\x9ceach of us is to narrate the\r\nhistory of his first love. \xe2\x80\x99Tis your turn, Sergy\xc3\xa9i Nikol\xc3\xa1evitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9i Nikol\xc3\xa1evitch, a rather corpulent man, with a plump, fair-skinned\r\nface, first looked at the host, then raised his eyes to the ceiling.--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhad no first love,\xe2\x80\x9d--he began at last:--\xe2\x80\x9cI began straight off with the\r\nsecond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow was that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery simply. I was eighteen years of age when, for the first time, I\r\ndangled after a very charming young lady; but I courted her as though it\r\nwere no new thing to me: exactly as I courted others afterward. To tell\r\nthe truth, I fell in love, for the first and last time, at the age of\r\nsix, with my nurse;--but that is a very long time ago. The details of\r\nour relations have been erased from my memory; but even if I remembered\r\nthem, who would be interested in them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen what are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d--began the host.--\xe2\x80\x9cThere was nothing very\r\nstartling about my first love either; I never fell in love with any one\r\nbefore Anna Iv\xc3\xa1novna, now my wife; and everything ran as though on oil\r\nwith us; our fathers made up the match, we very promptly fell in love\r\nwith each other, and entered the bonds of matrimony without delay. My\r\nstory can be told in two words. I must confess, gentlemen, that in\r\nraising the question of first love, I set my hopes on you, I will not\r\nsay old, but yet no longer young bachelors. Will not you divert us with\r\nsomething, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Petr\xc3\xb3vitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first love belongs, as a matter of fact, not altogether to the\r\nordinary category,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied, with a slight hesitation, Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nPetr\xc3\xb3vitch, a man of forty, whose black hair was sprinkled with grey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d--said the host and Sergy\xc3\xa9i Nikol\xc3\xa1evitch in one breath.--\xe2\x80\x9cSo much\r\nthe better.... Tell us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like ... or no: I will not narrate; I am no great hand at\r\ntelling a story; it turns out dry and short, or long-drawn-out and\r\nartificial. But if you will permit me, I will write down all that I\r\nremember in a note-book, and will read it aloud to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first the friends would not consent, but Vlad\xc3\xadmir Petr\xc3\xb3vitch\r\ninsisted on having his own way. A fortnight later they came together\r\nagain, and Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch kept his promise.\r\n\r\nThis is what his note-book contained.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nI was sixteen years old at the time. The affair took place in the summer\r\nof 1833.\r\n\r\nI was living in Moscow, in my parents\xe2\x80\x99 house. They had hired a villa\r\nnear the Kal\xc3\xbaga barrier, opposite the Nesk\xc3\xbatchny Park.[2]--I was\r\npreparing for the university, but was working very little and was not in\r\na hurry.\r\n\r\nNo one restricted my freedom. I had done whatever I pleased ever since I\r\nhad parted with my last French governor, who was utterly unable to\r\nreconcile himself to the thought that he had fallen \xe2\x80\x9clike a bomb\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n(_comme une bombe_) into Russia, and with a stubborn expression on his\r\nface, wallowed in bed for whole days at a time. My father treated me in\r\nan indifferently-affectionate way; my mother paid hardly any attention\r\nto me, although she had no children except me: other cares engrossed\r\nher. My father, still a young man and very handsome, had married her\r\nfrom calculation; she was ten years older than he. My mother led a\r\nmelancholy life: she was incessantly in a state of agitation, jealousy,\r\nand wrath--but not in the presence of my father; she was very much\r\nafraid of him, and he maintained a stern, cold, and distant manner.... I\r\nhave never seen a man more exquisitely calm, self-confident, and\r\nself-controlled.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the first weeks I spent at the villa. The weather\r\nwas magnificent; we had left town the ninth of May, on St. Nicholas\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nday. I rambled,--sometimes in the garden of our villa, sometimes in\r\nNesk\xc3\xbatchny Park, sometimes beyond the city barriers; I took with me some\r\nbook or other,--a course of Kaid\xc3\xa1noff,--but rarely opened it, and\r\nchiefly recited aloud poems, of which I knew a great many by heart. The\r\nblood was fermenting in me, and my heart was aching--so sweetly and\r\nabsurdly; I was always waiting for something, shrinking at something,\r\nand wondering at everything, and was all ready for anything at a\r\nmoment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. My fancy was beginning to play, and hovered swiftly\r\never around the selfsame image, as martins hover round a belfry at\r\nsunset. But even athwart my tears and athwart the melancholy, inspired\r\nnow by a melodious verse, now by the beauty of the evening, there peered\r\nforth, like grass in springtime, the joyous sensation of young, bubbling\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI had a saddle-horse; I was in the habit of saddling it myself, and\r\nwhen I rode off alone as far as possible, in some direction, launching\r\nout at a gallop and fancying myself a knight at a tourney--how blithely\r\nthe wind whistled in my ears!--Or, turning my face skyward, I welcomed\r\nits beaming light and azure into my open soul.\r\n\r\nI remember, at that time, the image of woman, the phantom of woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlove, almost never entered my mind in clearly-defined outlines; but in\r\neverything I thought, in everything I felt, there lay hidden the\r\nhalf-conscious, shamefaced presentiment of something new, inexpressibly\r\nsweet, feminine....\r\n\r\nThis presentiment, this expectation permeated my whole being; I breathed\r\nit, it coursed through my veins in every drop of blood ... it was fated\r\nto be speedily realised.\r\n\r\nOur villa consisted of a wooden manor-house with columns, and two tiny\r\noutlying wings; in the wing to the left a tiny factory of cheap\r\nwall-papers was installed.... More than once I went thither to watch how\r\nhalf a score of gaunt, dishevelled young fellows in dirty smocks and\r\nwith tipsy faces were incessantly galloping about at the wooden levers\r\nwhich jammed down the square blocks of the press, and in that manner, by\r\nthe weight of their puny bodies, printed the motley-hued patterns of the\r\nwall-papers. The wing on the right stood empty and was for rent. One\r\nday--three weeks after the ninth of May--the shutters on the windows of\r\nthis wing were opened, and women\xe2\x80\x99s faces made their appearance in them;\r\nsome family or other had moved into it. I remember how, that same day at\r\ndinner, my mother inquired of the butler who our new neighbours were,\r\nand on hearing the name of Princess Zasy\xc3\xa9kin, said at first, not without\r\nsome respect:--\xe2\x80\x9cAh! a Princess\xe2\x80\x9d ... and then she added:--\xe2\x80\x9cShe must be\r\nsome poor person!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey came in three hired carriages, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked the butler, as he\r\nrespectfully presented a dish. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have no carriage of their own,\r\nma\xe2\x80\x99am, and their furniture is of the very plainest sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned my mother,--\xe2\x80\x9cand nevertheless, it is better so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father shot a cold glance at her; she subsided into silence.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Princess Zasy\xc3\xa9kin could not be a wealthy woman: the\r\nwing she had hired was so old and tiny and low-roofed that people in the\r\nleast well-to-do would not have been willing to inhabit it.--However, I\r\nlet this go in at one ear and out at the other. The princely title had\r\nlittle effect on me: I had recently been reading Schiller\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nBrigands.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nI had a habit of prowling about our garden every evening, gun in hand,\r\nand standing guard against the crows.--I had long cherished a hatred for\r\nthose wary, rapacious and crafty birds. On the day of which I have been\r\nspeaking, I went into the garden as usual, and, after having fruitlessly\r\nmade the round of all the alleys (the crows recognised me from afar, and\r\nmerely cawed spasmodically at a distance), I accidentally approached the\r\nlow fence which separated _our_ territory from the narrow strip of\r\ngarden extending behind the right-hand wing and appertaining to it. I\r\nwas walking along with drooping head. Suddenly I heard voices: I glanced\r\nover the fence--and was petrified.... A strange spectacle presented\r\nitself to me.\r\n\r\nA few paces distant from me, on a grass-plot between green\r\nraspberry-bushes, stood a tall, graceful young girl, in a striped, pink\r\nfrock and with a white kerchief on her head; around her pressed four\r\nyoung men, and she was tapping them in turn on the brow with those small\r\ngrey flowers, the name of which I do not know, but which are familiar to\r\nchildren; these little flowers form tiny sacs, and burst with a pop when\r\nthey are struck against anything hard. The young men offered their\r\nforeheads to her so willingly, and in the girl\xe2\x80\x99s movements (I saw her\r\nform in profile) there was something so bewitching, caressing, mocking,\r\nand charming, that I almost cried aloud in wonder and pleasure; and I\r\nbelieve I would have given everything in the world if those lovely\r\nlittle fingers had only consented to tap me on the brow. My gun slid\r\ndown on the grass, I forgot everything, I devoured with my eyes that\r\nslender waist, and the neck and the beautiful arms, and the slightly\r\nruffled fair hair, the intelligent eyes and those lashes, and the\r\ndelicate cheek beneath them....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, hey there, young man!\xe2\x80\x9d--suddenly spoke up a voice near\r\nme:--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it permissible to stare like that at strange young ladies?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI trembled all over, I was stupefied.... Beside me, on the other side of\r\nthe fence, stood a man with closely-clipped black hair, gazing\r\nironically at me. At that same moment, the young girl turned toward\r\nme.... I beheld huge grey eyes in a mobile, animated face--and this\r\nwhole face suddenly began to quiver, and to laugh, and the white teeth\r\ngleamed from it, the brows elevated themselves in an amusing way.... I\r\nflushed, picked up my gun from the ground, and, pursued by ringing but\r\nnot malicious laughter, I ran to my own room, flung myself on the bed,\r\nand covered my face with my hands. My heart was fairly leaping within\r\nme; I felt very much ashamed and very merry: I experienced an\r\nunprecedented emotion.\r\n\r\nAfter I had rested awhile, I brushed my hair, made myself neat and went\r\ndown-stairs to tea. The image of the young girl floated in front of me;\r\nmy heart had ceased to leap, but ached in an agreeable sort of way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat ails thee?\xe2\x80\x9d--my father suddenly asked me:--\xe2\x80\x9chast thou killed a\r\ncrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was on the point of telling him all, but refrained and only smiled to\r\nmyself. As I was preparing for bed, I whirled round thrice on one foot,\r\nI know not why, pomaded my hair, got into bed and slept all night like a\r\ndead man. Toward morning I awoke for a moment, raised my head, cast a\r\nglance of rapture around me--and fell asleep again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I to get acquainted with them?\xe2\x80\x9d was my first thought, as soon as\r\nI awoke in the morning. I went out into the garden before tea, but did\r\nnot approach too close to the fence, and saw no one. After tea I walked\r\nseveral times up and down the street in front of the villa, and cast a\r\ndistant glance at the windows.... I thought I descried _her_ face behind\r\nthe curtains, and retreated with all possible despatch. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must get\r\nacquainted,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought, as I walked with irregular strides up and down\r\nthe sandy stretch which extends in front of the Nesk\xc3\xbatchny Park ... \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nhow? that is the question.\xe2\x80\x9d I recalled the most trifling incidents of\r\nthe meeting on the previous evening; for some reason, her manner of\r\nlaughing at me presented itself to me with particular clearness.... But\r\nwhile I was fretting thus and constructing various plans, Fate was\r\nalready providing for me.\r\n\r\nDuring my absence, my mother had received a letter from her new\r\nneighbour on grey paper sealed with brown wax, such as is used only on\r\npostal notices, and on the corks of cheap wine. In this letter, written\r\nin illiterate language, and with a slovenly chirography, the Princess\r\nrequested my mother to grant her her protection: my mother, according to\r\nthe Princess\xe2\x80\x99s words, was well acquainted with the prominent people on\r\nwhom the fortune of herself and her children depended, as she had some\r\nextremely important law-suits: \xe2\x80\x9cI apeal tyou,\xe2\x80\x9d--she wrote,--\xe2\x80\x9cas a knoble\r\nwoman to a knoble woman, and moarover, it is agriable to me to makeus of\r\nthis oportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d In conclusion, she asked permission of my mother to\r\ncall upon her. I found my mother in an unpleasant frame of mind: my\r\nfather was not at home, and she had no one with whom to take counsel. It\r\nwas impossible not to reply to a \xe2\x80\x9cknoble woman,\xe2\x80\x9d and to a Princess into\r\nthe bargain; but how to reply perplexed my mother. It seemed to her\r\nill-judged to write a note in French, and my mother was not strong in\r\nRussian orthography herself--and was aware of the fact--and did not wish\r\nto compromise herself. She was delighted at my arrival, and immediately\r\nordered me to go to the Princess and explain to her verbally that my\r\nmother was always ready, to the extent of her ability, to be of service\r\nto Her Radiance,[3] and begged that she would call upon her about one\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nThis unexpectedly swift fulfilment of my secret wishes both delighted\r\nand frightened me; but I did not betray the emotion which held\r\npossession of me, and preliminarily betook myself to my room for the\r\npurpose of donning a new neckcloth and coat; at home I went about in a\r\nround-jacket and turn-over collars, although I detested them greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the cramped and dirty anteroom of the wing, which I entered with an\r\ninvoluntary trembling of my whole body, I was received by a grey-haired\r\nold serving-man with a face the hue of dark copper, pig-like, surly\r\nlittle eyes, and such deep wrinkles on his forehead as I had never seen\r\nbefore in my life. He was carrying on a platter the gnawed spinal bone\r\nof a herring, and, pushing to with his foot the door which led into the\r\nadjoining room, he said abruptly:--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Princess Zasy\xc3\xa9kin at home?\xe2\x80\x9d--I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVonif\xc3\xa1ty!\xe2\x80\x9d--screamed a quavering female voice on the other side of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe servant silently turned his back on me, thereby displaying the\r\nbadly-worn rear of his livery with its solitary, rusted, armouried\r\nbutton, and went away, leaving the platter on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHast thou been to the police-station?\xe2\x80\x9d--went on that same feminine\r\nvoice. The servant muttered something in reply.--\xe2\x80\x9cHey?... Some one has\r\ncome?\xe2\x80\x9d--was the next thing audible.... \xe2\x80\x9cThe young gentleman from next\r\ndoor?--Well, ask him in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come into the drawing-room, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the servant, making his\r\nappearance again before me, and picking up the platter from the floor. I\r\nadjusted my attire and entered the \xe2\x80\x9cdrawing-room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI found myself in a tiny and not altogether clean room, with shabby\r\nfurniture which seemed to have been hastily set in place. At the window,\r\nin an easy-chair with a broken arm, sat a woman of fifty, with uncovered\r\nhair[4] and plain-featured, clad in an old green gown, and with a\r\nvariegated worsted kerchief round her neck. Her small black eyes fairly\r\nbored into me.\r\n\r\nI went up to her and made my bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honour of speaking to Princess Zasy\xc3\xa9kin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am Princess Zasy\xc3\xa9kin: and you are the son of Mr. B--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, madam. I have come to you with a message from my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray be seated. Vonif\xc3\xa1ty! where are my keys? Hast thou seen them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI communicated to Madame Zasy\xc3\xa9kin my mother\xe2\x80\x99s answer to her note. She\r\nlistened to me, tapping the window-pane with her thick, red fingers, and\r\nwhen I had finished she riveted her eyes on me once more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good; I shall certainly go,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she at last.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut how young\r\nyou are still! How old are you, allow me to ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSixteen,\xe2\x80\x9d--I replied with involuntary hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe Princess pulled out of her pocket some dirty, written documents,\r\nraised them up to her very nose and began to sort them over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a good age,\xe2\x80\x9d--she suddenly articulated, turning and fidgeting in\r\nher chair.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd please do not stand on ceremony. We are plain folks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo plain,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought, with involuntary disgust taking in with a\r\nglance the whole of her homely figure.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the other door of the drawing-room was swiftly thrown\r\nwide open, and on the threshold appeared the young girl whom I had seen\r\nin the garden the evening before. She raised her hand and a smile\r\nflitted across her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here is my daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the Princess, pointing at her with her\r\nelbow.--\xe2\x80\x9cZ\xc3\xadnotchka, the son of our neighbour, Mr. B--. What is your\r\nname, permit me to inquire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVlad\xc3\xadmir,\xe2\x80\x9d--I replied, rising and lisping with agitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your patronymic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPetr\xc3\xb3vitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! I once had an acquaintance, a chief of police, whose name was\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Petr\xc3\xb3vitch also. Vonif\xc3\xa1ty! don\xe2\x80\x99t hunt for the keys; the keys\r\nare in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young girl continued to gaze at me with the same smile as before,\r\nslightly puckering up her eyes and bending her head a little on one\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have already seen M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar,\xe2\x80\x9d--she began. (The silvery tone of\r\nher voice coursed through me like a sweet chill.)--\xe2\x80\x9cWill you permit me\r\nto call you so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray do, madam,\xe2\x80\x9d--I lisped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was that?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked the Princess.\r\n\r\nThe young Princess did not answer her mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you busy now?\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, without taking her eyes off me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen will you help me to wind some wool? Come hither, to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head at me and left the drawing-room. I followed her.\r\n\r\nIn the room which we entered the furniture was a little better and was\r\narranged with great taste.--But at that moment I was almost unable to\r\nnotice anything; I moved as though in a dream and felt a sort of intense\r\nsensation of well-being verging on stupidity throughout my frame.\r\n\r\nThe young Princess sat down, produced a knot of red wool, and pointing\r\nme to a chair opposite her, she carefully unbound the skein and placed\r\nit on my hands. She did all this in silence, with a sort of diverting\r\ndeliberation, and with the same brilliant and crafty smile on her\r\nslightly parted lips. She began to wind the wool upon a card doubled\r\ntogether, and suddenly illumined me with such a clear, swift glance,\r\nthat I involuntarily dropped my eyes. When her eyes, which were\r\ngenerally half closed, opened to their full extent her face underwent a\r\ncomplete change; it was as though light had inundated it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you think of me yesterday, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar?\xe2\x80\x9d--she asked, after\r\na brief pause.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly must have condemned me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ... Princess ... I thought nothing ... how can I....\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d--she returned.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not know me yet; I want people always\r\nto speak the truth to me. You are sixteen, I heard, and I am twenty-one;\r\nyou see that I am a great deal older than you, and therefore you must\r\nalways speak the truth to me ... and obey me,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added.--\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me;\r\nwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you look at me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI became still more confused; but I raised my eyes to hers,\r\nnevertheless. She smiled, only not in her former manner, but with a\r\ndifferent, an approving smile.--\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, caressingly\r\nlowering her voice:--\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like that.... Your face pleases me; I\r\nforesee that we shall be friends. And do you like me?\xe2\x80\x9d--she added slyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrincess....\xe2\x80\x9d I was beginning....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place, call me Zina\xc3\xadda Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna; and in the second\r\nplace,--what sort of a habit is it for children\xe2\x80\x9d--(she corrected\r\nherself)--\xe2\x80\x9cfor young men--not to say straight out what they feel? You do\r\nlike me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough it was very pleasant to me to have her talk so frankly to me,\r\nstill I was somewhat nettled. I wanted to show her that she was not\r\ndealing with a small boy, and, assuming as easy and serious a mien as I\r\ncould, I said:--\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I like you very much, Zina\xc3\xadda Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna; I\r\nhave no desire to conceal the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, pausing at intervals.--\xe2\x80\x9cHave you a governor?\xe2\x80\x9d--she\r\nsuddenly inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I have not had a governor this long time past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI lied: a month had not yet elapsed since I had parted with my\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, I see: you are quite grown up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe slapped me lightly on the fingers.--\xe2\x80\x9cHold your hands straight!\xe2\x80\x9d--And\r\nshe busied herself diligently with winding her ball.\r\n\r\nI took advantage of the fact that she did not raise her eyes, and set to\r\nscrutinising her, first by stealth, then more and more boldly. Her face\r\nseemed to me even more charming than on the day before: everything about\r\nit was so delicate, intelligent and lovely. She was sitting with her\r\nback to the window, which was hung with a white shade; a ray of sunlight\r\nmaking its way through that shade inundated with a flood of light her\r\nfluffy golden hair, her innocent neck, sloping shoulders, and calm,\r\ntender bosom.--I gazed at her--and how near and dear she became to me!\r\nIt seemed to me both that I had known her for a long time and that I had\r\nknown nothing and had not lived before she came.... She wore a rather\r\ndark, already shabby gown, with an apron; I believe I would willingly\r\nhave caressed every fold of that gown and of that apron. The tips of her\r\nshoes peeped out from under her gown; I would have bowed down to those\r\nlittle boots.... \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here I sit, in front of her,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought.--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave become acquainted with her ... what happiness, my God!\xe2\x80\x9d I came\r\nnear bouncing out of my chair with rapture, but I merely dangled my feet\r\nto and fro a little, like a child who is enjoying dainties.\r\n\r\nI felt as much at my ease as a fish does in water, and I would have\r\nliked never to leave that room again as long as I lived.\r\n\r\nHer eyelids slowly rose, and again her brilliant eyes beamed caressingly\r\nbefore me, and again she laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow you stare at me!\xe2\x80\x9d--she said slowly, shaking her finger at me.\r\n\r\nI flushed scarlet.... \xe2\x80\x9cShe understands all, she sees all,\xe2\x80\x9d--flashed\r\nthrough my head. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how could she fail to see and understand all?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a clattering in the next room, and a sword clanked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZ\xc3\xadna!\xe2\x80\x9d--screamed the old Princess from the drawing-room.--\xe2\x80\x9cByelovz\xc3\xb3roff\r\nhas brought thee a kitten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA kitten!\xe2\x80\x9d--cried Zina\xc3\xadda, and springing headlong from her chair, she\r\nflung the ball on my knees and ran out.\r\n\r\nI also rose, and, laying the skein of wool on the window-sill, went into\r\nthe drawing-room, and stopped short in amazement. In the centre of the\r\nroom lay a kitten with outstretched paws; Zina\xc3\xadda was kneeling in front\r\nof it, and carefully raising its snout. By the side of the young\r\nPrincess, taking up nearly the entire wall-space between the windows,\r\nwas visible a fair-complexioned, curly-haired young man, a hussar, with\r\na rosy face and protruding eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ridiculous!\xe2\x80\x9d--Zina\xc3\xadda kept repeating:--\xe2\x80\x9cand its eyes are not grey,\r\nbut green, and what big ears it has! Thank you, Vikt\xc3\xb3r Eg\xc3\xb3ritch! you are\r\nvery kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe hussar, in whom I recognised one of the young men whom I had seen on\r\nthe preceding evening, smiled and bowed, clicking his spurs and clanking\r\nthe links of his sword as he did so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou were pleased to say yesterday that you wished to possess a striped\r\nkitten with large ears ... so I have got it, madam. Your word is my\r\nlaw.\xe2\x80\x9d--And again he bowed.\r\n\r\nThe kitten mewed faintly, and began to sniff at the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is hungry!\xe2\x80\x9d--cried Zina\xc3\xadda.--\xe2\x80\x9cVonif\xc3\xa1ty! S\xc3\xb3nya! bring some milk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe chambermaid, in an old yellow gown and with a faded kerchief on her\r\nhead, entered with a saucer of milk in her hand, and placed it in front\r\nof the kitten. The kitten quivered, blinked, and began to lap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a rosy tongue it has,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Zina\xc3\xadda, bending her head down\r\nalmost to the floor, and looking sideways at it, under its very nose.\r\n\r\nThe kitten drank its fill, and began to purr, affectedly contracting and\r\nrelaxing its paws. Zina\xc3\xadda rose to her feet, and turning to the maid,\r\nsaid indifferently:--\xe2\x80\x9cTake it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour hand--in return for the kitten,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the hussar, displaying his\r\nteeth, and bending over the whole of his huge body, tightly confined in\r\na new uniform.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth hands,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Zina\xc3\xadda, offering him her hands. While he was\r\nkissing them, she gazed at me over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nI stood motionless on one spot, and did not know whether to laugh or to\r\nsay something, or to hold my peace. Suddenly, through the open door of\r\nthe anteroom, the figure of our footman, Fe\xc3\xb3dor, caught my eye. He was\r\nmaking signs to me. I mechanically went out to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou want?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour mamma has sent for you,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said in a whisper.--\xe2\x80\x9cShe is angry\r\nbecause you do not return with an answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, have I been here long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than an hour.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than an hour!\xe2\x80\x9d--I repeated involuntarily, and returning to the\r\ndrawing-room, I began to bow and scrape my foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d--the young Princess asked me, with a glance at\r\nthe hussar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must go home, madam. So I am to say,\xe2\x80\x9d--I added, addressing the old\r\nwoman,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat you will call upon us at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that, my dear fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old Princess hurriedly drew out her snuffbox, and took a pinch so\r\nnoisily that I fairly jumped.--\xe2\x80\x9cSay that,\xe2\x80\x9d--she repeated, tearfully\r\nblinking and grunting.\r\n\r\nI bowed once more, turned and left the room with the same sensation of\r\nawkwardness in my back which a very young man experiences when he knows\r\nthat people are staring after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar, you must drop in to see us,\xe2\x80\x9d--called\r\nZina\xc3\xadda, and again burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes her laugh all the time?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, as I wended my way home\r\naccompanied by Fe\xc3\xb3dor, who said nothing to me, but moved along\r\ndisapprovingly behind me. My mother reproved me, and inquired, with\r\nsurprise, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat could I have been doing so long at the Princess\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nmade her no answer, and went off to my own room. I had suddenly grown\r\nvery melancholy.... I tried not to weep.... I was jealous of the hussar.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Princess, according to her promise, called on my mother, and did not\r\nplease her. I was not present at their meeting, but at table my mother\r\nnarrated to my father that that Princess Zasy\xc3\xa9kin seemed to her a _femme\r\ntr\xc3\xa8s vulgaire_; that she had bored her immensely with her requests that\r\nshe would intervene on her behalf with Prince Sergy\xc3\xa9i; that she was\r\nalways having such law-suits and affairs,--_de vilaines affaires\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99argent_,--and that she must be a great rogue. But my mother added that\r\nshe had invited her with her daughter to dine on the following day (on\r\nhearing the words \xe2\x80\x9cwith her daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d I dropped my nose into my\r\nplate),--because, notwithstanding, she was a neighbour, and with a name.\r\nThereupon my father informed my mother that he now recalled who the lady\r\nwas: that in his youth he had known the late Prince Zasy\xc3\xa9kin, a\r\ncapitally-educated but flighty and captious man; that in society he was\r\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9c_le Parisien_,\xe2\x80\x9d because of his long residence in Paris; that he\r\nhad been very wealthy, but had gambled away all his property--and, no\r\none knew why, though probably it had been for the sake of the\r\nmoney,--\xe2\x80\x9calthough he might have made a better choice,\xe2\x80\x9d--added my father,\r\nwith a cold smile,--he had married the daughter of some clerk in a\r\nchancellery, and after his marriage had gone into speculation, and\r\nruined himself definitively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a wonder she did not try to borrow money,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very likely to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d--said my father, calmly.--\xe2\x80\x9cDoes she speak\r\nFrench?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM-m-m. However, that makes no difference. I think thou saidst that\r\nthou hadst invited her daughter; some one assured me that she is a very\r\ncharming and well-educated girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Then she does not take after her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor after her father,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned my father.--\xe2\x80\x9cHe was also well\r\neducated, but stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mother sighed, and became thoughtful. My father relapsed into\r\nsilence. I felt very awkward during the course of that conversation.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I betook myself to the garden, but without my gun. I had\r\npledged my word to myself that I would not go near the \xe2\x80\x9cZasy\xc3\xa9kin\r\ngarden\xe2\x80\x9d; but an irresistible force drew me thither, and not in vain. I\r\nhad no sooner approached the fence than I caught sight of Zina\xc3\xadda. This\r\ntime she was alone. She was holding a small book in her hands and\r\nstrolling slowly along the path. She did not notice me. I came near\r\nletting her slip past; but suddenly caught myself up and coughed.\r\n\r\nShe turned round but did not pause, put aside with one hand the broad\r\nblue ribbon of her round straw hat, looked at me, smiled quietly, and\r\nagain riveted her eyes on her book.\r\n\r\nI pulled off my cap, and after fidgeting about a while on one spot, I\r\nwent away with a heavy heart. \xe2\x80\x9c_Que suis-je pour elle?_\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought (God\r\nknows why) in French.\r\n\r\nFamiliar footsteps resounded behind me; I glanced round and beheld my\r\nfather advancing toward me with swift, rapid strides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the young Princess?\xe2\x80\x9d--he asked me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost thou know her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw her this morning at the Princess her mother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father halted and, wheeling abruptly round on his heels, retraced his\r\nsteps. As he came on a level with Zina\xc3\xadda he bowed courteously to her.\r\nShe bowed to him in return, not without some surprise on her face, and\r\nlowered her book. I saw that she followed him with her eyes. My father\r\nalways dressed very elegantly, originally and simply; but his figure had\r\nnever seemed to me more graceful, never had his grey hat sat more\r\nhandsomely on his curls, which were barely beginning to grow thin.\r\n\r\nI was on the point of directing my course toward Zina\xc3\xadda, but she did\r\nnot even look at me, but raised her book once more and walked away.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nI spent the whole of that evening and the following day in a sort of\r\ngloomy stupor. I remember that I made an effort to work, and took up\r\nKaid\xc3\xa1noff; but in vain did the large-printed lines and pages of the\r\nfamous text-book flit before my eyes. Ten times in succession I read the\r\nwords: \xe2\x80\x9cJulius C\xc3\xa6sar was distinguished for military daring,\xe2\x80\x9d without\r\nunderstanding a word, and I flung aside my book. Before dinner I pomaded\r\nmy hair again, and again donned my frock-coat and neckerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that for?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired my mother.--\xe2\x80\x9cThou art not a student yet,\r\nand God knows whether thou wilt pass thy examination. And thy\r\nround-jacket was made not very long ago. Thou must not discard it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere are to be guests,\xe2\x80\x9d--I whispered, almost in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense! What sort of guests are they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was compelled to submit. I exchanged my coat for my round-jacket, but\r\ndid not remove my neckerchief. The Princess and her daughter made their\r\nappearance half an hour before dinner; the old woman had thrown a yellow\r\nshawl over her green gown, with which I was familiar, and had donned an\r\nold-fashioned mob-cap with ribbons of a fiery hue. She immediately began\r\nto talk about her notes of hand, to sigh and to bewail her poverty, and\r\nto \xe2\x80\x9cimportune,\xe2\x80\x9d but did not stand in the least upon ceremony; and she\r\ntook snuff noisily and fidgeted and wriggled in her chair as before. It\r\nnever seemed to enter her head that she was a Princess. On the other\r\nhand, Zina\xc3\xadda bore herself very stiffly, almost haughtily, like a real\r\nyoung Princess. Cold impassivity and dignity had made their appearance\r\non her countenance, and I did not recognise her,--did not recognise her\r\nlooks or her smile, although in this new aspect she seemed to me very\r\nbeautiful. She wore a thin bar\xc3\xa8ge gown with pale-blue figures; her hair\r\nfell in long curls along her cheeks, in the English fashion: this\r\ncoiffure suited the cold expression of her face.\r\n\r\nMy father sat beside her during dinner, and with the exquisite and\r\nimperturbable courtesy which was characteristic of him, showed attention\r\nto his neighbour. He glanced at her from time to time, and she glanced\r\nat him now and then, but in such a strange, almost hostile, manner.\r\nTheir conversation proceeded in French;--I remember that I was surprised\r\nat the purity of Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s accent. The old Princess, as before, did not\r\nrestrain herself in the slightest degree during dinner, but ate a great\r\ndeal and praised the food. My mother evidently found her wearisome, and\r\nanswered her with a sort of sad indifference; my father contracted his\r\nbrows in a slight frown from time to time. My mother did not like\r\nZina\xc3\xadda either.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s a haughty young sprig,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said the next day.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when one\r\ncomes to think of it, what is there for her to be proud of?--_avec sa\r\nmine de grisette_!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently, thou hast not seen any grisettes,\xe2\x80\x9d--my father remarked to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, God be thanked!... Only, how art thou capable of\r\njudging of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda paid absolutely no attention whatever to me. Soon after dinner\r\nthe old Princess began to take her leave.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall rely upon your protection, M\xc3\xa1rya Nikol\xc3\xa1evna and Pi\xc3\xb3tr\r\nVas\xc3\xadlitch,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, in a sing-song tone, to my father and\r\nmother.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done! I have seen prosperous days, but they are\r\ngone. Here am I a Radiance,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, with an unpleasant laugh,--\xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good of an honour when you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d--My father\r\nbowed respectfully to her and escorted her to the door of the anteroom.\r\nI was standing there in my round-jacket, and staring at the floor, as\r\nthough condemned to death. Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour toward me had\r\ndefinitively annihilated me. What, then, was my amazement when, as she\r\npassed me, she whispered to me hastily, and with her former affectionate\r\nexpression in her eyes:--\xe2\x80\x9cCome to us at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, do you hear?\r\nwithout fail....\xe2\x80\x9d I merely threw my hands apart in amazement;--but she\r\nwas already retreating, having thrown a white scarf over her head.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nPrecisely at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock I entered the tiny wing inhabited by the\r\nPrincess, clad in my coat, and with my hair brushed up into a crest on\r\ntop of my head. The old servant glared surlily at me, and rose\r\nreluctantly from his bench. Merry voices resounded in the drawing-room.\r\nI opened the door and retreated a pace in astonishment. In the middle of\r\nthe room, on a chair, stood the young Princess, holding a man\xe2\x80\x99s hat in\r\nfront of her; around the chair thronged five men. They were trying to\r\ndip their hands into the hat, but she kept raising it on high and\r\nshaking it violently. On catching sight of me she exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, stay! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a new guest; he must be given a ticket,\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\nspringing lightly from the chair, she seized me by the lapel of my\r\ncoat.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome along,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she;--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy do you stand there? Messieurs,\r\nallow me to make you acquainted: this is Monsieur Voldemar, the son of\r\nour neighbour. And this,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, turning to me, and pointing to the\r\nvisitors in turn,--\xe2\x80\x9cis Count Mal\xc3\xa9vsky, Doctor L\xc3\xbashin, the poet\r\nMaid\xc3\xa1noff, retired Captain Nirm\xc3\xa1tzky, and Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff the hussar, whom\r\nyou have already seen. I beg that you will love and favour each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so confused that I did not even bow to any one; in Doctor L\xc3\xbashin I\r\nrecognised that same swarthy gentleman who had so ruthlessly put me to\r\nshame in the garden; the others were strangers to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCount!\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued Zina\xc3\xadda,--\xe2\x80\x9cwrite a ticket for M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned the Count, with a slight accent,--a very\r\nhandsome and foppishly-attired man, with a dark complexion, expressive\r\nbrown eyes, a thin, white little nose, and a slender moustache over his\r\ntiny mouth.--\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not been playing at forfeits with us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis unjust,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff and the gentleman who had been\r\nalluded to as the retired Captain,--a man of forty, horribly pockmarked,\r\ncurly-haired as a negro, round-shouldered, bow-legged, and dressed in a\r\nmilitary coat without epaulets, worn open on the breast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWrite a ticket, I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated the Princess.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a\r\nrebellion is this? M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar is with us for the first time, and\r\nto-day no law applies to him. No grumbling--write; I will have it so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his shoulders, but submissively bowing his head, he\r\ntook a pen in his white, ring-decked hand, tore off a scrap of paper and\r\nbegan to write on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me at least to explain to M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar what it is all\r\nabout,\xe2\x80\x9d--began L\xc3\xbashin, in a bantering tone;--\xe2\x80\x9cotherwise he will be\r\nutterly at a loss. You see, young man, we are playing at forfeits; the\r\nPrincess must pay a fine, and the one who draws out the lucky ticket\r\nmust kiss her hand. Do you understand what I have told you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI merely glanced at him and continued to stand as though in a fog, while\r\nthe Princess again sprang upon the chair and again began to shake the\r\nhat. All reached up to her--I among the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaid\xc3\xa1noff,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the Princess to the tall young man with a gaunt face,\r\ntiny mole-like eyes and extremely long, black hair,--\xe2\x80\x9cyou, as a poet,\r\nought to be magnanimous and surrender your ticket to M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar, so\r\nthat he may have two chances instead of one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Maid\xc3\xa1noff shook his head in refusal and tossed his hair. I put in my\r\nhand into the hat after all the rest, drew out and unfolded a ticket....\r\nO Lord! what were my sensations when I beheld on it, \xe2\x80\x9cKiss!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKiss!\xe2\x80\x9d--I cried involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo! He has won,\xe2\x80\x9d--chimed in the Princess.--\xe2\x80\x9cHow delighted I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x9d--She descended from the chair, and gazed into my eyes so clearly\r\nand sweetly that my heart fairly laughed with joy.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you\r\nglad?\xe2\x80\x9d--she asked me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d ... I stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSell me your ticket,\xe2\x80\x9d--suddenly blurted out Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff, right in my\r\near.--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you one hundred rubles for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI replied to the hussar by such a wrathful look that Zina\xc3\xadda clapped\r\nher hands, and L\xc3\xbashin cried:--\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a gallant fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d--he went on,--\xe2\x80\x9cin my capacity of master of ceremonies, I am bound\r\nto see that all the regulations are carried out. M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar, get\r\ndown on one knee. That is our rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda stood before me with her head bent a little to one side, as\r\nthough the better to scrutinise me, and offered me her hand with\r\ndignity. Things grew dim before my eyes; I tried to get down on one\r\nknee, plumped down on both knees, and applied my lips to Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfingers in so awkward a manner that I scratched the tip of my nose\r\nslightly on her nails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d--shouted L\xc3\xbashin, and helped me to rise.\r\n\r\nThe game of forfeits continued. Zina\xc3\xadda placed me beside her. What\r\npenalties they did invent! Among other things, she had to impersonate a\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cstatue\xe2\x80\x9d--and she selected as a pedestal the monstrously homely\r\nNirm\xc3\xa1tzky, ordering him to lie flat on the floor, and to tuck his face\r\ninto his breast. The laughter did not cease for a single moment. All\r\nthis noise and uproar, this unceremonious, almost tumultuous merriment,\r\nthese unprecedented relations with strangers, fairly flew to my head;\r\nfor I was a boy who had been reared soberly, and in solitude, and had\r\ngrown up in a stately home of gentry. I became simply intoxicated, as\r\nthough with wine. I began to shout with laughter and chatter more\r\nloudly than the rest, so that even the old Princess, who was sitting in\r\nthe adjoining room with some sort of pettifogger from the \xc3\x8dversky\r\nGate[5] who had been summoned for a conference, came out to take a look\r\nat me. But I felt so happy that, as the saying is, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care a\r\nfarthing for anybody\xe2\x80\x99s ridicule, or anybody\xe2\x80\x99s oblique glances.\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda continued to display a preference for me and never let me leave\r\nher side. In one forfeit I was made to sit by her, covered up with one\r\nand the same silk kerchief: I was bound to tell her _my secret_. I\r\nremember how our two heads found themselves suddenly in choking,\r\nsemi-transparent, fragrant gloom; how near and softly her eyes sparkled\r\nin that gloom, and how hotly her parted lips breathed; and her teeth\r\nwere visible, and the tips of her hair tickled and burned me. I\r\nmaintained silence. She smiled mysteriously and slyly, and at last\r\nwhispered to me: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d But I merely flushed and laughed,\r\nand turned away, and could hardly draw my breath. We got tired of\r\nforfeits, and began to play \xe2\x80\x9cstring.\xe2\x80\x9d Good heavens! what rapture I felt\r\nwhen, forgetting myself with gaping, I received from her a strong, sharp\r\nrap on my fingers; and how afterward I tried to pretend that I was\r\nyawning with inattention, but she mocked at me and did not touch my\r\nhands, which were awaiting the blow!\r\n\r\nBut what a lot of other pranks we played that same evening! We played on\r\nthe piano, and sang, and danced, and represented a gipsy camp. We\r\ndressed Nirm\xc3\xa1tzky up like a bear, and fed him with water and salt. Count\r\nMal\xc3\xa9vsky showed us several card tricks, and ended by stacking the cards\r\nand dealing himself all the trumps at whist; upon which L\xc3\xbashin \xe2\x80\x9chad the\r\nhonour of congratulating him.\xe2\x80\x9d Maid\xc3\xa1noff declaimed to us fragments from\r\nhis poem, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Murderer\xe2\x80\x9d (this occurred in the very thick of\r\nromanticism), which he intended to publish in a black binding, with the\r\ntitle in letters of the colour of blood. We stole his hat from the knees\r\nof the pettifogger from the \xc3\x8dversky Gate, and made him dance the kaz\xc3\xa1k\r\ndance by way of redeeming it. We dressed old Vonif\xc3\xa1ty up in a mob-cap,\r\nand the young Princess put on a man\xe2\x80\x99s hat.... It is impossible to\r\nrecount all we did. Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff alone remained most of the time in a\r\ncorner, angry and frowning.... Sometimes his eyes became suffused with\r\nblood, he grew scarlet all over and seemed to be on the very point of\r\nswooping down upon all of us and scattering us on all sides, like chips;\r\nbut the Princess glanced at him, menaced him with her finger, and again\r\nhe retired into his corner.\r\n\r\nWe were completely exhausted at last. The old Princess was equal to\r\nanything, as she put it,--no shouts disconcerted her,--but she felt\r\ntired and wished to rest. At midnight supper was served, consisting of a\r\nbit of old, dry cheese and a few cold patties filled with minced ham,\r\nwhich seemed to us more savoury than any pasty; there was only one\r\nbottle of wine, and that was rather queer:--dark, with a swollen neck,\r\nand the wine in it left an after-taste of pinkish dye; however, no one\r\ndrank it. Weary and happy to exhaustion, I emerged from the wing; a\r\nthunder-storm seemed to be brewing; the black storm-clouds grew larger\r\nand crept across the sky, visibly altering their smoky outlines. A light\r\nbreeze was uneasily quivering in the dark trees, and somewhere beyond\r\nthe horizon the thunder was growling angrily and dully, as though to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nI made my way through the back door to my room. My nurse-valet was\r\nsleeping on the floor and I was obliged to step over him; he woke up,\r\nsaw me, and reported that my mother was angry with me, and had wanted to\r\nsend after me again, but that my father had restrained her. I never went\r\nto bed without having bidden my mother good night and begged her\r\nblessing. There was no help for it! I told my valet that I would undress\r\nmyself and go to bed unaided,--and extinguished the candle. But I did\r\nnot undress and I did not go to bed.\r\n\r\nI seated myself on a chair and sat there for a long time, as though\r\nenchanted. That which I felt was so new and so sweet.... I sat there,\r\nhardly looking around me and without moving, breathing slowly, and only\r\nlaughing silently now, as I recalled, now inwardly turning cold at the\r\nthought that I was in love, that here it was, that love. Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nfloated softly before me in the darkness--floated, but did not float\r\naway; her lips still smiled as mysteriously as ever, her eyes gazed\r\nsomewhat askance at me, interrogatively, thoughtfully and tenderly ...\r\nas at the moment when I had parted from her. At last I rose on tiptoe,\r\nstepped to my bed and cautiously, without undressing, laid my head on\r\nthe pillow, as though endeavouring by the sharp movement to frighten off\r\nthat wherewith I was filled to overflowing....\r\n\r\nI lay down, but did not even close an eye. I speedily perceived that\r\ncertain faint reflections kept constantly falling into my room.... I\r\nraised myself and looked out of the window. Its frame was distinctly\r\ndefined from the mysteriously and confusedly whitened panes. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis the\r\nthunder-storm,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought,--and so, in fact, there was a thunder-storm;\r\nbut it had passed very far away, so that even the claps of thunder were\r\nnot audible; only in the sky long, indistinct, branching flashes of\r\nlightning, as it were, were uninterruptedly flashing up. They were not\r\nflashing up so much as they were quivering and twitching, like the wing\r\nof a dying bird. I rose, went to the window, and stood there until\r\nmorning.... The lightning-flashes never ceased for a moment; it was what\r\nis called a pitch-black night. I gazed at the dumb, sandy plain, at the\r\ndark mass of the Nesk\xc3\xbatchny Park, at the yellowish fa\xc3\xa7ades of the\r\ndistant buildings, which also seemed to be trembling at every faint\r\nflash.... I gazed, and could not tear myself away; those dumb\r\nlightning-flashes, those restrained gleams, seemed to be responding to\r\nthe dumb and secret outbursts which were flaring up within me also.\r\nMorning began to break; the dawn started forth in scarlet patches. With\r\nthe approach of the sun the lightning-flashes grew paler and paler; they\r\nquivered more and more infrequently, and vanished at last, drowned in\r\nthe sobering and unequivocal light of the breaking day.\r\n\r\nAnd my lightning-flashes vanished within me also. I felt great fatigue\r\nand tranquillity ... but Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s image continued to hover triumphantly\r\nover my soul. Only it, that image, seemed calm; like a flying swan from\r\nthe marshy sedges, it separated itself from the other ignoble figures\r\nwhich surrounded it, and as I fell asleep, I bowed down before it for\r\nthe last time in farewell and confiding adoration....\r\n\r\nOh, gentle emotions, soft sounds, kindness and calming of the\r\ndeeply-moved soul, melting joy of the first feelings of love,--where are\r\nye, where are ye?\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, when I went down-stairs to tea, my mother\r\nscolded me,--although less than I had anticipated,--and made me narrate\r\nhow I had spent the preceding evening. I answered her in few words,\r\nomitting many particulars and endeavouring to impart to my narrative the\r\nmost innocent of aspects.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, they are not people _comme il faut_,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked my\r\nmother;--\xe2\x80\x9cand I do not wish thee to run after them, instead of preparing\r\nthyself for the examination, and occupying thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I knew that my mother\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety was confined to these few words, I\r\ndid not consider it necessary to make her any reply; but after tea my\r\nfather linked his arm in mine, and betaking himself to the garden with\r\nme, made me tell him everything I had done and seen at the Zasy\xc3\xa9kins\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nMy father possessed a strange influence over me, and our relations were\r\nstrange. He paid hardly any attention to my education, but he never\r\nwounded me; he respected my liberty--he was even, if I may so express\r\nit, courteous to me ... only, he did not allow me to get close to him.\r\nI loved him, I admired him; he seemed to me a model man; and great\r\nheavens! how passionately attached to him I should have been, had I not\r\nconstantly felt his hand warding me off! On the other hand, when he\r\nwished, he understood how to evoke in me, instantaneously, with one\r\nword, one movement, unbounded confidence in him. My soul opened, I\r\nchatted with him as with an intelligent friend, as with an indulgent\r\npreceptor ... then, with equal suddenness, he abandoned me, and again\r\nhis hand repulsed me, caressingly and softly, but repulsed nevertheless.\r\n\r\nSometimes a fit of mirth came over him, and then he was ready to frolic\r\nand play with me like a boy (he was fond of every sort of energetic\r\nbodily exercise); once--only once--did he caress me with so much\r\ntenderness that I came near bursting into tears.... But his mirth and\r\ntenderness also vanished without leaving a trace, and what had taken\r\nplace between us gave me no hopes for the future; it was just as though\r\nI had seen it all in a dream. I used to stand and scrutinise his clever,\r\nhandsome, brilliant face ... and my heart would begin to quiver, and my\r\nwhole being would yearn toward him, ... and he would seem to feel what\r\nwas going on within me, and would pat me on the cheek in passing--and\r\neither go away, or begin to occupy himself with something, or suddenly\r\nfreeze all over,--as he alone knew how to freeze,--and I would\r\nimmediately shrivel up and grow frigid also. His rare fits of affection\r\nfor me were never called forth by my speechless but intelligible\r\nentreaties; they always came upon him without warning. When meditating,\r\nin after years, upon my father\xe2\x80\x99s character, I came to the conclusion\r\nthat he did not care for me or for family life; he loved something\r\ndifferent, and enjoyed that other thing to the full. \xe2\x80\x9cSeize what thou\r\ncanst thyself, and do not give thyself into any one\xe2\x80\x99s power; the whole\r\nart of life consists in belonging to one\xe2\x80\x99s self,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said to me once.\r\nOn another occasion I, in my capacity of a young democrat, launched out\r\nin his presence into arguments about liberty (he was what I called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckind\xe2\x80\x9d that day; at such times one could say whatever one liked to\r\nhim).--\xe2\x80\x9cLiberty,\xe2\x80\x9d--he repeated,--\xe2\x80\x9cbut dost thou know what can give a man\r\nliberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill, his own will, and the power which it gives is better than\r\nliberty. Learn to will, and thou wilt be free, and wilt command.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father wished, first of all and most of all, to enjoy life--and he\r\ndid enjoy life.... Perhaps he had a presentiment that he was not fated\r\nlong to take advantage of the \xe2\x80\x9cart\xe2\x80\x9d of living: he died at the age of\r\nforty-two.\r\n\r\nI described to my father in detail my visit to the Zasy\xc3\xa9kins. He\r\nlistened to me half-attentively, half-abstractedly, as he sat on the\r\nbench and drew figures on the sand with the tip of his riding-whip. Now\r\nand then he laughed, glanced at me in a brilliant, amused sort of way,\r\nand spurred me on by brief questions and exclamations. At first I could\r\nnot bring myself even to utter Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s name, but I could not hold out,\r\nand began to laud her. My father still continued to laugh. Then he\r\nbecame thoughtful, dropped his eyes and rose to his feet.\r\n\r\nI recalled the fact that, as he came out of the house, he had given\r\norders that his horse should be saddled. He was a capital rider, and\r\nknew much better how to tame the wildest horses than did Mr. Rarey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I ride with thee, papa?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d--he replied, and his face assumed its habitual\r\nindifferently-caressing expression.--\xe2\x80\x9cGo alone, if thou wishest; but\r\ntell the coachman that I shall not go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on me and walked swiftly away. I followed him with my\r\neyes, until he disappeared beyond the gate. I saw his hat moving along\r\nthe fence; he went into the Zasy\xc3\xa9kins\xe2\x80\x99 house.\r\n\r\nHe remained with them no more than an hour, but immediately thereafter\r\nwent off to town and did not return home until evening.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner I went to the Zasy\xc3\xa9kins\xe2\x80\x99 myself. I found no one in the\r\ndrawing-room but the old Princess. When she saw me, she scratched her\r\nhead under her cap with the end of her knitting-needle, and suddenly\r\nasked me: would I copy a petition for her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d--I replied, and sat down on the edge of a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly look out, and see that you make the letters as large as\r\npossible,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the Princess, handing me a sheet of paper scrawled over\r\nin a slovenly manner:--\xe2\x80\x9cand couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you do it to-day, my dear fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will copy it this very day, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe door of the adjoining room opened a mere crack and Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\nshowed itself in the aperture,--pale, thoughtful, with hair thrown\r\ncarelessly back. She stared at me with her large, cold eyes, and softly\r\nshut the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cZ\xc3\xadna,--hey there, Z\xc3\xadna!\xe2\x80\x9d--said the old woman. Zina\xc3\xadda did not answer. I\r\ncarried away the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s petition, and sat over it the whole\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nMy \xe2\x80\x9cpassion\xe2\x80\x9d began with that day. I remember that I then felt something\r\nof that which a man must feel when he enters the service: I had already\r\nceased to be a young lad; I was in love. I have said that my passion\r\ndated from that day; I might have added that my sufferings also dated\r\nfrom that day. I languished when absent from Zina\xc3\xadda; my mind would not\r\nwork, everything fell from my hands; I thought intently of her for days\r\ntogether.... I languished ... but in her presence I was no more at ease.\r\nI was jealous, I recognised my insignificance, I stupidly sulked and\r\nstupidly fawned; and, nevertheless, an irresistible force drew me to\r\nher, and every time I stepped across the threshold of her room, it was\r\nwith an involuntary thrill of happiness. Zina\xc3\xadda immediately divined\r\nthat I had fallen in love with her, and I never thought of concealing\r\nthe fact; she mocked at my passion, played tricks on me, petted and\r\ntormented me. It is sweet to be the sole source, the autocratic and\r\nirresponsible cause of the greatest joys and the profoundest woe to\r\nanother person, and I was like soft wax in Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s hands. However, I\r\nwas not the only one who was in love with her; all the men who were in\r\nthe habit of visiting her house were crazy over her, and she kept them\r\nall in a leash at her feet. It amused her to arouse in them now hopes,\r\nnow fears, to twist them about at her caprice (she called it, \xe2\x80\x9cknocking\r\npeople against one another\xe2\x80\x9d),--and they never thought of resisting, and\r\nwillingly submitted to her. In all her vivacious and beautiful being\r\nthere was a certain peculiarly bewitching mixture of guilefulness and\r\nheedlessness, of artificiality and simplicity, of tranquillity and\r\nplayfulness; over everything she did or said, over her every movement,\r\nhovered a light, delicate charm, and an original, sparkling force made\r\nitself felt in everything. And her face was incessantly changing and\r\nsparkling also; it expressed almost simultaneously derision,\r\npensiveness, and passion. The most varied emotions, light, fleeting as\r\nthe shadows of the clouds on a sunny, windy day, kept flitting over her\r\neyes and lips.\r\n\r\nEvery one of her adorers was necessary to her. Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff, whom she\r\nsometimes called \xe2\x80\x9cmy wild beast,\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes simply \xe2\x80\x9cmy own,\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\ngladly have flung himself into the fire for her; without trusting to his\r\nmental capacities and other merits, he kept proposing that he should\r\nmarry her, and hinting that the others were merely talking idly.\r\nMaid\xc3\xa1noff responded to the poetical chords of her soul: a rather cold\r\nman, as nearly all writers are, he assured her with intense force--and\r\nperhaps himself also--that he adored her. He sang her praises in\r\ninterminable verses and read them to her with an unnatural and a genuine\r\nsort of enthusiasm. And she was interested in him and jeered lightly at\r\nhim; she did not believe in him greatly, and after listening to his\r\neffusions she made him read P\xc3\xbashkin, in order, as she said, to purify\r\nthe air. L\xc3\xbashin, the sneering doctor, who was cynical in speech, knew\r\nher best of all and loved her best of all, although he abused her to her\r\nface and behind her back. She respected him, but would not let him go,\r\nand sometimes, with a peculiar, malicious pleasure, made him feel that\r\nhe was in her hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a coquette, I am heartless, I have the nature\r\nof an actress,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to him one day in my presence; \xe2\x80\x9cand \xe2\x80\x99tis well!\r\nSo give me your hand and I will stick a pin into it, and you will feel\r\nashamed before this young man, and it will hurt you; but nevertheless,\r\nMr. Upright Man, you will be so good as to laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d L\xc3\xbashin flushed\r\ncrimson, turned away and bit his lips, but ended by putting out his\r\nhand. She pricked it, and he actually did break out laughing ... and she\r\nlaughed also, thrusting the pin in pretty deeply and gazing into his\r\neyes while he vainly endeavoured to glance aside....\r\n\r\nI understood least of all the relations existing between Zina\xc3\xadda and\r\nCount Mal\xc3\xa9vsky. That he was handsome, adroit, and clever even I felt,\r\nbut the presence in him of some false, dubious element, was palpable\r\neven to me, a lad of sixteen, and I was amazed that Zina\xc3\xadda did not\r\nnotice it. But perhaps she did detect that false element and it did not\r\nrepel her. An irregular education, strange acquaintances, the constant\r\npresence of her mother, the poverty and disorder in the house--all this,\r\nbeginning with the very freedom which the young girl enjoyed, together\r\nwith the consciousness of her own superiority to the people who\r\nsurrounded her, had developed in her a certain half-scornful\r\ncarelessness and lack of exaction. No matter what happened--whether\r\nVonif\xc3\xa1ty came to report that there was no sugar, or some wretched bit\r\nof gossip came to light, or the visitors got into a quarrel among\r\nthemselves, she merely shook her curls, and said: \xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d--and\r\ngrieved very little over it.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, all my blood would begin to seethe when Mal\xc3\xa9vsky would\r\napproach her, swaying his body cunningly like a fox, lean elegantly over\r\nthe back of her chair and begin to whisper in her ear with a conceited\r\nand challenging smile, while she would fold her arms on her breast, gaze\r\nattentively at him and smile also, shaking her head the while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat possesses you to receive Mal\xc3\xa9vsky?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked her one day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, he has such handsome eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d--she replied.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is no\r\nbusiness of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not to think that I am in love with him,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said to me on\r\nanother occasion.--\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I cannot love people upon whom I am forced to\r\nlook down. I must have some one who can subdue me.... And I shall not\r\nhit upon such an one, for God is merciful! I shall not spare any one who\r\nfalls into my paws--no, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that you will never fall in love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how about you? Don\xe2\x80\x99t I love you?\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, tapping me on the nose\r\nwith the tip of her glove.\r\n\r\nYes, Zina\xc3\xadda made great fun of me. For the space of three weeks I saw\r\nher every day; and what was there that she did not do to me! She came to\r\nus rarely, but I did not regret that; in our house she was converted\r\ninto a young lady, a Princess,--and I avoided her. I was afraid of\r\nbetraying myself to my mother; she was not at all well disposed toward\r\nZina\xc3\xadda, and kept a disagreeable watch on us. I was not so much afraid\r\nof my father; he did not appear to notice me, and talked little with\r\nher, but that little in a peculiarly clever and significant manner. I\r\nceased to work, to read; I even ceased to stroll about the environs and\r\nto ride on horseback. Like a beetle tied by the leg, I hovered\r\nincessantly around the beloved wing; I believe I would have liked to\r\nremain there forever ... but that was impossible. My mother grumbled at\r\nme, and sometimes Zina\xc3\xadda herself drove me out. On such occasions I shut\r\nmyself up in my own room, or walked off to the very end of the garden,\r\nclimbed upon the sound remnant of a tall stone hothouse, and dangling my\r\nlegs over the wall, I sat there for hours and stared,--stared without\r\nseeing anything. White butterflies lazily flitted among the nettles\r\nbeside me; an audacious sparrow perched not far off on the\r\nhalf-demolished red bricks and twittered in an irritating manner,\r\nincessantly twisting his whole body about and spreading out his tail;\r\nthe still distrustful crows now and then emitted a caw, as they sat\r\nhigh, high above me on the naked crest of a birch-tree; the sun and the\r\nwind played softly through its sparse branches; the chiming of the\r\nbells, calm and melancholy, at the Don Monastery was wafted to me now\r\nand then,--and I sat on, gazing and listening, and became filled with a\r\ncertain nameless sensation which embraced everything: sadness and joy,\r\nand a presentiment of the future, and the desire and the fear of life.\r\nBut I understood nothing at the time of all that which was fermenting\r\nwithin me, or I would have called it all by one name, the name of\r\nZina\xc3\xadda.\r\n\r\nBut Zina\xc3\xadda continued to play with me as a cat plays with a mouse. Now\r\nshe coquetted with me, and I grew agitated and melted with emotion; now\r\nshe repulsed me, and I dared not approach her, dared not look at her.\r\n\r\nI remember that she was very cold toward me for several days in\r\nsuccession and I thoroughly quailed, and when I timidly ran to the wing\r\nto see them, I tried to keep near the old Princess, despite the fact\r\nthat she was scolding and screaming a great deal just at that time: her\r\naffairs connected with her notes of hand were going badly, and she had\r\nalso had two scenes with the police-captain of the precinct.\r\n\r\nOne day I was walking through the garden, past the familiar fence, when\r\nI caught sight of Zina\xc3\xadda. Propped up on both arms, she was sitting\r\nmotionless on the grass. I tried to withdraw cautiously, but she\r\nsuddenly raised her head and made an imperious sign to me. I became\r\npetrified on the spot; I did not understand her the first time. She\r\nrepeated her sign. I immediately sprang over the fence and ran joyfully\r\nto her; but she stopped me with a look and pointed to the path a couple\r\nof paces from her. In my confusion, not knowing what to do, I knelt down\r\non the edge of the path. She was so pale, such bitter grief, such\r\nprofound weariness were revealed in her every feature, that my heart\r\ncontracted within me, and I involuntarily murmured: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter\r\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda put out her hand, plucked a blade of grass, bit it, and tossed\r\nit away as far as she could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love me very much?\xe2\x80\x9d--she inquired suddenly.--\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made no answer,--and what answer was there for me to make?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d--she repeated, gazing at me as before.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so. They are the\r\nsame eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, becoming pensive, and covering her face with her\r\nhands.--\xe2\x80\x9cEverything has become repulsive to me,\xe2\x80\x9d--she whispered;--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwould like to go to the end of the world; I cannot endure this, I cannot\r\nreconcile myself.... And what is in store for me?... Akh, I am heavy at\r\nheart ... my God, how heavy at heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d--I timidly inquired.\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda did not answer me and merely shrugged her shoulders. I continued\r\nto kneel and to gaze at her with profound melancholy. Every word of\r\nhers fairly cut me to the heart. At that moment, I think I would\r\nwillingly have given my life to keep her from grieving. I gazed at her,\r\nand nevertheless, not understanding why she was heavy at heart, I\r\nvividly pictured to myself how, in a fit of uncontrollable sorrow, she\r\nhad suddenly gone into the garden, and had fallen on the earth, as\r\nthough she had been mowed down. All around was bright and green; the\r\nbreeze was rustling in the foliage of the trees, now and then rocking a\r\nbranch of raspberry over Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s head. Doves were cooing somewhere and\r\nthe bees were humming as they flew low over the scanty grass. Overhead\r\nthe sky shone blue,--but I was so sad....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecite some poetry to me,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Zina\xc3\xadda in a low voice, leaning on her\r\nelbow.--\xe2\x80\x9cI like to hear you recite verses. You make them go in a\r\nsing-song, but that does not matter, it is youthful. Recite to me: \xe2\x80\x98On\r\nthe Hills of Georgia.\xe2\x80\x99--Only, sit down first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sat down and recited, \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Hills of Georgia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That it is impossible not to love,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Zina\xc3\xadda.--\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why\r\npoetry is so nice; it says to us that which does not exist, and which is\r\nnot only better than what does exist, but even more like the truth....\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That it is impossible not to love\xe2\x80\x99?--I would like to, but\r\ncannot!\xe2\x80\x9d--Again she fell silent for a space, then suddenly started and\r\nrose to her feet.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome along. Maid\xc3\xa1noff is sitting with mamma; he\r\nbrought his poem to me, but I left him. He also is embittered now ...\r\nhow can it be helped? Some day you will find out ... but you must not be\r\nangry with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda hastily squeezed my hand, and ran on ahead. We returned to the\r\nwing. Maid\xc3\xa1noff set to reading us his poem of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Murderer,\xe2\x80\x9d which had\r\nonly just been printed, but I did not listen. He shrieked out his\r\nfour-footed iambics in a sing-song voice; the rhymes alternated and\r\njingled like sleigh-bells, hollow and loud; but I kept staring all the\r\nwhile at Zina\xc3\xadda, and striving to understand the meaning of her strange\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cOr, perchance, a secret rival\r\n     Has unexpectedly subjugated thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nsuddenly exclaimed Maid\xc3\xa1noff through his nose--and my eyes and Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmet. She dropped hers and blushed faintly. I saw that she was blushing,\r\nand turned cold with fright. I had been jealous before, but only at that\r\nmoment did the thought that she had fallen in love flash through my\r\nmind. \xe2\x80\x9cMy God! She is in love!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nMy real tortures began from that moment. I cudgelled my brains, I\r\npondered and pondered again, and watched Zina\xc3\xadda importunately, but\r\nsecretly, as far as possible. A change had taken place in her, that was\r\nevident. She took to going off alone to walk, and walked a long while.\r\nSometimes she did not show herself to her visitors; she sat for hours\r\ntogether in her chamber. This had not been her habit hitherto. Suddenly\r\nI became--or it seemed to me that I became--extremely penetrating. \xe2\x80\x9cIs\r\nit he? Or is it not he?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked myself, as in trepidation I mentally\r\nran from one of her admirers to another. Count Mal\xc3\xa9vsky (although I felt\r\nashamed to admit it for Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s sake) privately seemed to me more\r\ndangerous than the others.\r\n\r\nMy powers of observation extended no further than the end of my own\r\nnose, and my dissimulation probably failed to deceive any one; at all\r\nevents, Doctor L\xc3\xbashin speedily saw through me. Moreover, he also had\r\nundergone a change of late; he had grown thin, he laughed as frequently\r\nas ever, but somehow it was in a duller, more spiteful, a briefer\r\nway;--an involuntary, nervous irritability had replaced his former light\r\nirony and feigned cynicism.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you forever tagging on here, young man?\xe2\x80\x9d--he said to me one\r\nday, when he was left alone with me in the Zasy\xc3\xa9kins\xe2\x80\x99 drawing-room. (The\r\nyoung Princess had not yet returned from her stroll and the shrill voice\r\nof the old Princess was resounding in the upper story; she was wrangling\r\nwith her maid.)--\xe2\x80\x9cYou ought to be studying your lessons, working while\r\nyou are young;--but instead of that, what are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot tell whether I work at home,\xe2\x80\x9d--I retorted not without\r\narrogance, but also not without confusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch work you do! That\xe2\x80\x99s not what you have in your head. Well, I will\r\nnot dispute ... at your age, that is in the natural order of things. But\r\nyour choice is far from a happy one. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you see what sort of a house\r\nthis is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d--I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t understand me? So much the worse for you. I regard it as my\r\nduty to warn you. Fellows like me, old bachelors, may sit here: what\r\nharm will it do us? We are a hardened lot. You can\xe2\x80\x99t pierce our hide,\r\nbut your skin is still tender; the air here is injurious for\r\nyou,--believe me, you may become infected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you may. Are you healthy now? Are you in a normal condition? Is\r\nwhat you are feeling useful to you, good for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what am I feeling?\xe2\x80\x9d--said I;--and in my secret soul I admitted that\r\nthe doctor was right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEh, young man, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued the doctor, with an expression as\r\nthough something extremely insulting to me were contained in those two\r\nwords;--\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no use in your dissimulating, for what you have in\r\nyour soul you still show in your face, thank God! But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\r\narguing? I would not come hither myself, if ...\xe2\x80\x9d (the doctor set his\r\nteeth) ... \xe2\x80\x9cif I were not such an eccentric fellow. Only this is what\r\namazes me--how you, with your intelligence, can fail to see what is\r\ngoing on around you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is going on?\xe2\x80\x9d--I interposed, pricking up my ears.\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at me with a sort of sneering compassion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA nice person I am,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he, as though speaking to himself.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\npossessed me to say that to him. In a word,\xe2\x80\x9d--he added, raising his\r\nvoice,--\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat to you: the atmosphere here is not good for you. You\r\nfind it pleasant here, and no wonder! And the scent of a hothouse is\r\npleasant also--but one cannot live in it! Hey! hearken to me,--set to\r\nwork again on Kaid\xc3\xa1noff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old Princess entered and began to complain to the doctor of\r\ntoothache. Then Zina\xc3\xadda made her appearance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d--added the old Princess,--\xe2\x80\x9cscold her, doctor, do. She drinks\r\niced water all day long; is that healthy for her, with her weak chest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you do that?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired L\xc3\xbashin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what result can it have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat result? You may take cold and die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? Is it possible? Well, all right--that just suits me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d--growled the doctor. The old Princess went away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do say so,\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Zina\xc3\xadda.--\xe2\x80\x9cIs living such a cheerful thing?\r\nLook about you.... Well--is it nice? Or do you think that I do not\r\nunderstand it, do not feel it? It affords me pleasure to drink iced\r\nwater, and you can seriously assure me that such a life is worth too\r\nmuch for me to imperil it for a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure--I do not speak of\r\nhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked L\xc3\xbashin:--\xe2\x80\x9ccaprice and independence.... Those two\r\nwords sum you up completely; your whole nature lies in those two words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda burst into a nervous laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too late by one mail, my dear doctor. You observe badly; you are\r\nfalling behind.--Put on your spectacles.--I am in no mood for caprices\r\nnow; how jolly to play pranks on you or on myself!--and as for\r\nindependence.... M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar,\xe2\x80\x9d--added Zina\xc3\xadda, suddenly stamping her\r\nfoot,--\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t wear a melancholy face. I cannot endure to have people\r\ncommiserating me.\xe2\x80\x9d--She hastily withdrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis atmosphere is injurious, injurious to you, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d--said\r\nL\xc3\xbashin to me once more.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that same day the customary visitors assembled at the\r\nZasy\xc3\xa9kins\xe2\x80\x99; I was among the number.\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned on Maid\xc3\xa1noff\xe2\x80\x99s poem; Zina\xc3\xadda candidly praised\r\nit.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you know what?\xe2\x80\x9d--she said:--\xe2\x80\x9cIf I were a poet, I would\r\nselect other subjects. Perhaps this is all nonsense, but strange\r\nthoughts sometimes come into my head, especially when I am wakeful\r\ntoward morning, when the sky is beginning to turn pink and grey.--I\r\nwould, for example.... You will not laugh at me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No!\xe2\x80\x9d--we all exclaimed with one voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would depict,\xe2\x80\x9d--she went on, crossing her arms on her breast, and\r\nturning her eyes aside,--\xe2\x80\x9ca whole company of young girls, by night, in a\r\nbig boat, on a tranquil river. The moon is shining, and they are all in\r\nwhite and wear garlands of white flowers, and they are singing, you\r\nknow, something in the nature of a hymn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand, I understand, go on,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Maid\xc3\xa1noff significantly and\r\ndreamily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly there is a noise--laughter, torches, tambourines on the\r\nshore.... It is a throng of bacchantes running with songs and outcries.\r\nIt is your business to draw the picture, Mr. Poet ... only I would like\r\nto have the torches red and very smoky, and that the eyes of the\r\nbacchantes should gleam beneath their wreaths, and that the wreaths\r\nshould be dark. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget also tiger-skins and cups--and gold, a\r\ngreat deal of gold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is the gold to be?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired Maid\xc3\xa1noff, tossing back his lank\r\nhair and inflating his nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere? On the shoulders, the hands, the feet, everywhere. They say that\r\nin ancient times women wore golden rings on their ankles.--The\r\nbacchantes call the young girls in the boat to come to them. The girls\r\nhave ceased to chant their hymn,--they cannot go on with it,--but they\r\ndo not stir; the river drifts them to the shore. And now suddenly one of\r\nthem rises quietly.... This must be well described: how she rises\r\nquietly in the moonlight, and how startled her companions are.... She\r\nhas stepped over the edge of the boat, the bacchantes have surrounded\r\nher, they have dashed off into the night, into the gloom.... Present at\r\nthis point smoke in clouds; and everything has become thoroughly\r\nconfused. Nothing is to be heard but their whimpering, and her wreath\r\nhas been left lying on the shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda ceased speaking. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, she is in love!\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked Maid\xc3\xa1noff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all,\xe2\x80\x9d--she replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat cannot be made the subject of an entire poem,\xe2\x80\x9d--he remarked\r\npompously,--\xe2\x80\x9cbut I will utilise your idea for some lyrical verses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the romantic vein?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked Mal\xc3\xa9vsky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, in the romantic vein--in Byron\xe2\x80\x99s style.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut in my opinion, Hugo is better than Byron,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked the young\r\nCount, carelessly:--\xe2\x80\x9che is more interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHugo is a writer of the first class,\xe2\x80\x9d--rejoined Maid\xc3\xa1noff, \xe2\x80\x9cand my\r\nfriend Tonkosh\xc3\xa9eff, in his Spanish romance, \xe2\x80\x98El Trovador\xe2\x80\x99....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that\xe2\x80\x99s the book with the question-marks turned upside\r\ndown?\xe2\x80\x9d--interrupted Zina\xc3\xadda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. That is the accepted custom among the Spaniards. I was about to\r\nsay that Tonkosh\xc3\xa9eff....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now! You will begin to wrangle again about classicism and\r\nromanticism,\xe2\x80\x9d--Zina\xc3\xadda interrupted him again.--\xe2\x80\x9cLet us rather play....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt forfeits?\xe2\x80\x9d--put in L\xc3\xbashin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, forfeits is tiresome; but at comparisons.\xe2\x80\x9d (This game had been\r\ninvented by Zina\xc3\xadda herself; some object was named, and each person\r\ntried to compare it with something or other, and the one who matched the\r\nthing with the best comparison received a prize.) She went to the\r\nwindow. The sun had just set; long, crimson clouds hung high aloft in\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are those clouds like?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Zina\xc3\xadda and, without waiting for\r\nour answers, she said:--\xe2\x80\x9cI think that they resemble those crimson sails\r\nwhich were on Cleopatra\xe2\x80\x99s golden ship, when she went to meet Antony. You\r\nwere telling me about that not long ago, do you remember, Maid\xc3\xa1noff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll of us, like Polonius in \xe2\x80\x9cHamlet,\xe2\x80\x9d decided that the clouds reminded\r\nus precisely of those sails, and that none of us could find a better\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how old was Antony at that time?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked Zina\xc3\xadda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was assuredly still a young man,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Mal\xc3\xa9vsky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he was young,\xe2\x80\x9d--assented Maid\xc3\xa1noff confidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me,\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed L\xc3\xbashin,--\xe2\x80\x9che was over forty years of age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver forty years of age,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Zina\xc3\xadda, darting a swift glance at\r\nhim....\r\n\r\nI soon went home.--\xe2\x80\x9cShe is in love,\xe2\x80\x9d my lips whispered involuntarily....\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with whom?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe days passed by. Zina\xc3\xadda grew more and more strange, more and more\r\nincomprehensible. One day I entered her house and found her sitting on a\r\nstraw-bottomed chair, with her head pressed against the sharp edge of a\r\ntable. She straightened up ... her face was again all bathed in tears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! It\xe2\x80\x99s you!\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, with a harsh grimace.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome hither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went up to her: she laid her hand on my head and, suddenly seizing me\r\nby the hair, began to pull it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts\xe2\x80\x9d ... I said at last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! It hurts! And doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it hurt me? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it hurt me?\xe2\x80\x9d--she\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA\xc3\xaf!\xe2\x80\x9d--she suddenly cried, perceiving that she had pulled out a small\r\ntuft of my hair.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done? Poor M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar!\xe2\x80\x9d She\r\ncarefully straightened out the hairs she had plucked out, wound them\r\nround her finger, and twisted them into a ring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will put your hair in my locket and wear it,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, and tears\r\nglistened in her eyes.--\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that will comfort you a little ... but\r\nnow, good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI returned home and found an unpleasant state of things there. A scene\r\nwas in progress between my father and my mother; she was upbraiding him\r\nfor something or other, while he, according to his wont, was maintaining\r\na cold, polite silence--and speedily went away. I could not hear what my\r\nmother was talking about, neither did I care to know: I remember only,\r\nthat, at the conclusion of the scene, she ordered me to be called to her\r\nboudoir, and expressed herself with great dissatisfaction about my\r\nfrequent visits at the house of the old Princess, who was, according to\r\nher assertions, _une femme capable de tout_. I kissed her hand (I always\r\ndid that when I wanted to put an end to the conversation), and went off\r\nto my own room. Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s tears had completely discomfited me; I\r\npositively did not know what to think, and was ready to cry myself: I\r\nwas still a child, in spite of my sixteen years. I thought no more of\r\nMal\xc3\xa9vsky, although Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff became more and more menacing every day,\r\nand glared at the shifty Count like a wolf at a sheep; but I was not\r\nthinking of anything or of anybody. I lost myself in conjectures and\r\nkept seeking isolated spots. I took a special fancy to the ruins of the\r\nhothouse. I could clamber up on the high wall, seat myself, and sit\r\nthere such an unhappy, lonely, and sad youth that I felt sorry for\r\nmyself--and how delightful those mournful sensations were, how I gloated\r\nover them!...\r\n\r\nOne day, I was sitting thus on the wall, gazing off into the distance\r\nand listening to the chiming of the bells ... when suddenly something\r\nran over me--not a breeze exactly, not a shiver, but something\r\nresembling a breath, the consciousness of some one\xe2\x80\x99s proximity.... I\r\ndropped my eyes. Below me, in a light grey gown, with a pink parasol on\r\nher shoulder, Zina\xc3\xadda was walking hastily along the road. She saw me,\r\nhalted, and, pushing up the brim of her straw hat, raised her velvety\r\neyes to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing there, on such a height?\xe2\x80\x9d--she asked me, with a\r\nstrange sort of smile.--\xe2\x80\x9cThere now,\xe2\x80\x9d--she went on,--\xe2\x80\x9cyou are always\r\ndeclaring that you love me--jump down to me here on the road if you\r\nreally do love me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore the words were well out of Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s mouth I had flown down,\r\nexactly as though some one had given me a push from behind. The wall was\r\nabout two fathoms high. I landed on the ground with my feet, but the\r\nshock was so violent that I could not retain my balance; I fell, and\r\nlost consciousness for a moment. When I came to myself I felt, without\r\nopening my eyes, that Zina\xc3\xadda was by my side.--\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d--she was\r\nsaying, as she bent over me--and tender anxiety was audible in her\r\nvoice--\xe2\x80\x9chow couldst thou do that, how couldst thou obey?... I love thee\r\n... rise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer breast was heaving beside me, her hands were touching my head, and\r\nsuddenly--what were my sensations then!--her soft, fresh lips began to\r\ncover my whole face with kisses ... they touched my lips.... But at this\r\npoint Zina\xc3\xadda probably divined from the expression of my face that I had\r\nalready recovered consciousness, although I still did not open my\r\neyes--and swiftly rising to her feet, she said:--\xe2\x80\x9cCome, get up, you\r\nrogue, you foolish fellow! Why do you lie there in the dust?\xe2\x80\x9d--I got up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me my parasol,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Zina\xc3\xadda.--\xe2\x80\x9cI have thrown it somewhere; and\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that what nonsense is this? You are hurt? You have\r\nburned yourself with the nettles, I suppose. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me like that,\r\nI tell you.... Why, he understands nothing, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer me,\xe2\x80\x9d--she\r\nadded, as though speaking to herself.... \xe2\x80\x9cGo home, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar,\r\nbrush yourself off, and don\xe2\x80\x99t dare to follow me--if you do I shall be\r\nvery angry, and I shall never again....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not finish her speech and walked briskly away, while I sat down\r\nby the roadside ... my legs would not support me. The nettles had stung\r\nmy hands, my back ached, and my head was reeling; but the sensation of\r\nbeatitude which I then experienced has never since been repeated in my\r\nlife. It hung like a sweet pain in all my limbs and broke out at last in\r\nrapturous leaps and exclamations. As a matter of fact, I was still a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nI was so happy and proud all that day; I preserved so vividly on my\r\nvisage the feeling of Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s kisses; I recalled her every word with\r\nsuch ecstasy; I so cherished my unexpected happiness that I even became\r\nfrightened; I did not even wish to see her who was the cause of those\r\nnew sensations. It seemed to me that I could ask nothing more of Fate,\r\nthat now I must \xe2\x80\x9ctake and draw a deep breath for the last time, and\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x9d On the other hand, when I set off for the wing next day, I felt a\r\ngreat agitation, which I vainly endeavoured to conceal beneath the\r\ndiscreet facial ease suitable for a man who wishes to let it be\r\nunderstood that he knows how to keep a secret. Zina\xc3\xadda received me very\r\nsimply, without any emotion, merely shaking her finger at me and asking:\r\nHad I any bruises? All my discreet ease of manner and mysteriousness\r\ninstantly disappeared, and along with them my agitation. Of course I had\r\nnot expected anything in particular, but Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s composure acted on me\r\nlike a dash of cold water. I understood that I was a child in her\r\neyes--and my heart waxed very heavy! Zina\xc3\xadda paced to and fro in the\r\nroom, smiling swiftly every time she glanced at me; but her thoughts\r\nwere far away, I saw that clearly.... \xe2\x80\x9cShall I allude to what happened\r\nyesterday myself,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought;--\xe2\x80\x9cshall I ask her where she was going in\r\nsuch haste, in order to find out, definitively?\xe2\x80\x9d ... but I merely waved\r\nmy hand in despair and sat down in a corner.\r\n\r\nByelovz\xc3\xb3roff entered; I was delighted to see him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not found you a gentle saddle-horse,\xe2\x80\x9d--he began in a surly\r\ntone;--\xe2\x80\x9cFreitag vouches to me for one--but I am not convinced. I am\r\nafraid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what are you afraid, allow me to inquire?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Zina\xc3\xadda.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what? Why, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to ride. God forbid that any accident\r\nshould happen! And what has put that freak into your head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, that\xe2\x80\x99s my affair, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu my wild beast. In that case, I will ask\r\nPi\xc3\xb3tr Vas\xc3\xadlievitch\xe2\x80\x9d.... (My father was called Pi\xc3\xb3tr Vas\xc3\xadlievitch.... I\r\nwas amazed that she should mention his name so lightly and freely,\r\nexactly as though she were convinced of his readiness to serve her.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so!\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff.--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it with him that you\r\nwish to ride?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith him or some one else,--that makes no difference to you. Only not\r\nwith you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot with me,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff.--\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like. What does it matter? I\r\nwill get you the horse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut see to it that it is not a cow-like beast. I warn you in advance\r\nthat I mean to gallop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGallop, if you wish.... But is it with Mal\xc3\xa9vsky that you are going to\r\nride?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I ride with him, warrior? Come, quiet down. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take\r\nyou too. You know that for me Mal\xc3\xa9vsky is now--fie!\xe2\x80\x9d--She shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that just to console me,\xe2\x80\x9d--growled Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff.\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda narrowed her eyes.--\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that console you? oh ... oh oh ...\r\nwarrior!\xe2\x80\x9d--she said at last, as though unable to find any other\r\nword.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you like to ride with us, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not fond of riding ... in a large party,\xe2\x80\x9d ... I muttered, without\r\nraising my eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou prefer a _t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate_?... Well, every one to his taste,\xe2\x80\x9d--she\r\nsaid, with a sigh.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut go, Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff, make an effort. I want the\r\nhorse for to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but where am I to get the money?\xe2\x80\x9d--interposed the old Princess.\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda frowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not asking any from you; Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff will trust me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe will, he will,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the old Princess--and suddenly screamed at\r\nthe top of her voice:--\xe2\x80\x9cDuny\xc3\xa1shka!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Maman_, I made you a present of a bell,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked the young Princess.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuny\xc3\xa1shka!\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated the old woman.\r\n\r\nByelovz\xc3\xb3roff bowed himself out; I went out with him. Zina\xc3\xadda did not\r\ndetain me.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nI rose early the next morning, cut myself a staff, and went off beyond\r\nthe city barrier. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have a walk and banish my grief,\xe2\x80\x9d--I said to\r\nmyself. It was a beautiful day, brilliant but not too hot; a cheerful,\r\nfresh breeze was blowing over the earth and rustling and playing\r\nmoderately, keeping in constant motion and agitating nothing. For a long\r\ntime I roamed about on the hills and in the forests. I did not feel\r\nhappy; I had left home with the intention of surrendering myself to\r\nmelancholy;--but youth, the fine weather, the fresh air, the diversion\r\nof brisk pedestrian exercise, the delight of lying in solitude on the\r\nthick grass, produced their effect; the memory of those unforgettable\r\nwords, of those kisses, again thrust themselves into my soul. It was\r\npleasant to me to think that Zina\xc3\xadda could not, nevertheless, fail to do\r\njustice to my decision, to my heroism.... \xe2\x80\x9cOthers are better for her\r\nthan I,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought:--\xe2\x80\x9cso be it! On the other hand, the others only say\r\nwhat they will do, but I have done it! And what else am I capable of\r\ndoing for her?\xe2\x80\x9d--My imagination began to ferment. I began to picture to\r\nmyself how I would save her from the hands of enemies; how, all bathed\r\nin blood, I would wrest her out of prison; how I would die at her feet.\r\nI recalled a picture which hung in our drawing-room of Malek-Adel\r\ncarrying off Matilda--and thereupon became engrossed in the appearance\r\nof a big, speckled woodpecker which was busily ascending the slender\r\ntrunk of a birch-tree, and uneasily peering out from behind it, now on\r\nthe right, now on the left, like a musician from behind the neck of his\r\nbass-viol.\r\n\r\nThen I began to sing: \xe2\x80\x9cNot the white snows,\xe2\x80\x9d--and ran off into the\r\nromance which was well known at that period, \xe2\x80\x9cI will await thee when the\r\nplayful breeze\xe2\x80\x9d; then I began to recite aloud Erm\xc3\xa1k\xe2\x80\x99s invocation to the\r\nstars in Khomyak\xc3\xb3ff\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy; I tried to compose something in a\r\nsentimental vein; I even thought out the line wherewith the whole poem\r\nwas to conclude: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Zina\xc3\xadda! Zina\xc3\xadda!\xe2\x80\x9d--But it came to nothing.\r\nMeanwhile, dinner-time was approaching. I descended into the valley; a\r\nnarrow, sandy path wound through it and led toward the town. I strolled\r\nalong that path.... The dull trampling of horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs resounded behind\r\nme. I glanced round, involuntarily came to a standstill and pulled off\r\nmy cap. I beheld my father and Zina\xc3\xadda. They were riding side by side.\r\nMy father was saying something to her, bending his whole body toward\r\nher, and resting his hand on the neck of her horse; he was smiling.\r\nZina\xc3\xadda was listening to him in silence, with her eyes severely downcast\r\nand lips compressed. At first I saw only them; it was not until several\r\nmoments later that Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff made his appearance from round a turn in\r\nthe valley, dressed in hussar uniform with pelisse, and mounted on a\r\nfoam-flecked black horse. The good steed was tossing his head, snorting\r\nand curvetting; the rider was both reining him in and spurring him on.\r\nI stepped aside. My father gathered up his reins and moved away from\r\nZina\xc3\xadda; she slowly raised her eyes to his--and both set off at a\r\ngallop.... Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff dashed headlong after them with clanking sword.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is as red as a crab,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought,--\xe2\x80\x9cand she.... Why is she so pale?\r\nShe has been riding the whole morning--and yet she is pale?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI redoubled my pace and managed to reach home just before dinner. My\r\nfather was already sitting, re-dressed, well-washed and fresh, beside my\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s arm-chair, and reading aloud to her in his even, sonorous\r\nvoice, the feuilleton of the _Journal des D\xc3\xa9bats_; but my mother was\r\nlistening to him inattentively and, on catching sight of me, inquired\r\nwhere I had been all day, adding, that she did not like to have me\r\nprowling about God only knew where and God only knew with whom. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nhave been walking alone,\xe2\x80\x9d--I was on the point of replying; but I glanced\r\nat my father and for some reason or other held my peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the next five or six days I hardly saw Zina\xc3\xadda; she\r\ngave it out that she was ill, which did not, however, prevent the\r\nhabitual visitors from presenting themselves at the wing--\xe2\x80\x9cto take their\r\nturn in attendance,\xe2\x80\x9d--as they expressed it;--all except Maid\xc3\xa1noff, who\r\nimmediately became dispirited as soon as he had no opportunity to go\r\ninto raptures. Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff sat morosely in a corner, all tightly\r\nbuttoned up and red in the face; on Count Mal\xc3\xa9vsky\xe2\x80\x99s delicate visage\r\nhovered constantly a sort of evil smile; he really had fallen into\r\ndisfavour with Zina\xc3\xadda and listened with particular pains to the old\r\nPrincess, and drove with her to the Governor-General\xe2\x80\x99s in a hired\r\ncarriage. But this trip proved unsuccessful and even resulted in an\r\nunpleasantness for Mal\xc3\xa9vsky: he was reminded of some row with certain\r\nPut\xc3\xa9isk officers, and was compelled, in self-justification, to say that\r\nhe was inexperienced at the time. L\xc3\xbashin came twice a day, but did not\r\nremain long. I was somewhat afraid of him after our last explanation\r\nand, at the same time, I felt a sincere attachment for him. One day he\r\nwent for a stroll with me in the Nesk\xc3\xbatchny Park, was very good-natured\r\nand amiable, imparted to me the names and properties of various plants\r\nand flowers, and suddenly exclaimed--without rhyme or reason, as the\r\nsaying is--as he smote himself on the brow: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I, like a fool, thought\r\nshe was a coquette! Evidently, it is sweet to sacrifice one\xe2\x80\x99s self--for\r\nsome people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean to say by that?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say anything to you,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned L\xc3\xbashin, abruptly.\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda avoided me; my appearance--I could not but perceive the\r\nfact--produced an unpleasant impression on her. She involuntarily turned\r\naway from me ... involuntarily; that was what was bitter, that was what\r\nbroke my heart! But there was no help for it and I tried to keep out of\r\nher sight and only stand guard over her from a distance, in which I was\r\nnot always successful. As before, something incomprehensible was taking\r\nplace with her; her face had become different--she was altogether a\r\ndifferent person. I was particularly struck by the change which had\r\ntaken place in her on a certain warm, tranquil evening. I was sitting on\r\na low bench under a wide-spreading elder-bush; I loved that little nook;\r\nthe window of Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s chamber was visible thence. I was sitting there;\r\nover my head, in the darkened foliage, a tiny bird was rummaging fussily\r\nabout; a great cat with outstretched back had stolen into the garden,\r\nand the first beetles were booming heavily in the air, which was still\r\ntransparent although no longer light. I sat there and stared at the\r\nwindow, and waited to see whether some one would not open it: and, in\r\nfact, it did open, and Zina\xc3\xadda made her appearance in it. She wore a\r\nwhite gown, and she herself--her face, her shoulders and her hands--was\r\npale to whiteness. She remained for a long time motionless, and for a\r\nlong time stared, without moving, straight in front of her from beneath\r\nher contracted brows. I did not recognise that look in her. Then she\r\nclasped her hands very, very tightly, raised them to her lips, to her\r\nforehead--and suddenly, unlocking her fingers, pushed her hair away from\r\nher ears, shook it back and, throwing her head downward from above with\r\na certain decisiveness, she shut the window with a bang.\r\n\r\nTwo days later she met me in the park. I tried to step aside, but she\r\nstopped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your hand\xe2\x80\x9d--she said to me, with her former affection.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\na long time since you and I have had a chat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at her; her eyes were beaming softly and her face was smiling,\r\nas though athwart a mist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still ailing?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, everything has passed off now,\xe2\x80\x9d--she replied, breaking off a small,\r\nred rose.--\xe2\x80\x9cI am a little tired, but that will pass off also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you be once more the same as you used to be?\xe2\x80\x9d--I queried.\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda raised the rose to her face, and it seemed to me as though the\r\nreflection of the brilliant petals fell upon her cheeks.--\xe2\x80\x9cHave I\r\nchanged?\xe2\x80\x9d--she asked me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you have changed,\xe2\x80\x9d--I replied in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was cold toward you,--I know that,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Zina\xc3\xadda;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut you must\r\nnot pay any heed to that.... I could not do otherwise.... Come, what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe use of talking about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not want me to love you--that\xe2\x80\x99s what!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed gloomily,\r\nwith involuntary impetuosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, love me, but not as before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be friends,--that is how!\xe2\x80\x9d--Zina\xc3\xadda allowed me to smell of the\r\nrose.--\xe2\x80\x9cListen; I am much older than you, you know--I might be your\r\naunt, really; well, if not your aunt, then your elder sister. While\r\nyou....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a child to you,\xe2\x80\x9d--I interrupted her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, you are a child, but a dear, good, clever child, of whom I\r\nam very fond. Do you know what? I will appoint you to the post of my\r\npage from this day forth; and you are not to forget that pages must not\r\nbe separated from their mistress. Here is a token of your new dignity\r\nfor you,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, sticking the rose into the button-hole of my\r\nround-jacket; \xe2\x80\x9ca token of our favour toward you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have received many favours from you in the past,\xe2\x80\x9d--I murmured.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d--said Zina\xc3\xadda, and darting a sidelong glance at me.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a\r\nmemory you have! Well? And I am ready now also....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd bending toward me, she imprinted on my brow a pure, calm kiss.\r\n\r\nI only stared at her--but she turned away and, saying,--\xe2\x80\x9cFollow me, my\r\npage,\xe2\x80\x9d--walked to the wing. I followed her--and was in a constant state\r\nof bewilderment.--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat this gentle,\r\nsensible young girl is that same Zina\xc3\xadda whom I used to know?\xe2\x80\x9d--And her\r\nvery walk seemed to me more quiet, her whole figure more majestic, more\r\ngraceful....\r\n\r\nAnd, my God! with what fresh violence did love flame up within me!\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the visitors were assembled again in the wing, and the\r\nyoung Princess came out to them. The whole company was present, in full\r\nforce, as on that first evening, never to be forgotten by me: even\r\nNirm\xc3\xa1tzky had dragged himself thither. Maid\xc3\xa1noff had arrived earlier\r\nthan all the rest; he had brought some new verses. The game of forfeits\r\nbegan again, but this time without the strange sallies, without pranks\r\nand uproar; the gipsy element had vanished. Zina\xc3\xadda gave a new mood to\r\nour gathering. I sat beside her, as a page should. Among other things,\r\nshe proposed that the one whose forfeit was drawn should narrate his\r\ndream; but this was not a success. The dreams turned out to be either\r\nuninteresting (Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff had dreamed that he had fed his horse on\r\ncarp, and that it had a wooden head), or unnatural, fictitious.\r\nMaid\xc3\xa1noff regaled us with a complete novel; there were sepulchres and\r\nangels with harps, and burning lights and sounds wafted from afar.\r\nZina\xc3\xadda did not allow him to finish. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is a question of\r\ninvention,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she,--\xe2\x80\x9cthen let each one relate something which is\r\npositively made up.\xe2\x80\x9d--Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff had to speak first.\r\n\r\nThe young hussar became confused.--\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot invent anything!\xe2\x80\x9d--he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d--interposed Zina\xc3\xadda.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome, imagine, for instance,\r\nthat you are married, and tell us how you would pass the time with your\r\nwife. Would you lock her up?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you sit with her yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI certainly would sit with her myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good. Well, and what if that bored her, and she betrayed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would kill her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so. Well, now supposing that I were your wife, what would you do\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nByelovz\xc3\xb3roff made no answer for a while.--\xe2\x80\x9cI would kill myself....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda burst out laughing.--\xe2\x80\x9cI see that there\xe2\x80\x99s not much to be got out\r\nof you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe second forfeit fell to Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s share. She raised her eyes to the\r\nceiling and meditated.--\xe2\x80\x9cSee here,\xe2\x80\x9d--she began at last,--\xe2\x80\x9cthis is what I\r\nhave devised.... Imagine to yourselves a magnificent palace, a summer\r\nnight, and a marvellous ball. This ball is given by the young Queen.\r\nEverywhere there are gold, marble, silk, lights, diamonds, flowers, the\r\nsmoke of incense--all the whims of luxury.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you love luxury?\xe2\x80\x9d--interrupted L\xc3\xbashin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLuxury is beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d--she returned;--\xe2\x80\x9cI love everything that is\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than what is fine?\xe2\x80\x9d--he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is difficult; somehow I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother me. So\r\nthen, there is a magnificent ball. There are many guests, they are all\r\nyoung, very handsome, brave; all are desperately in love with the\r\nQueen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre there no women among the guests?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Mal\xc3\xa9vsky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo--or stay--yes, there are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso very handsome?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCharming. But the men are all in love with the Queen. She is tall and\r\nslender; she wears a small gold diadem on her black hair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at Zina\xc3\xadda--and at that moment she seemed so far above us, her\r\nwhite forehead and her impassive eyebrows exhaled so much clear\r\nintelligence and such sovereignty, that I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cThou thyself\r\nart that Queen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll throng around her,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued Zina\xc3\xadda;--\xe2\x80\x9call lavish the most\r\nflattering speeches on her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is she fond of flattery?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked L\xc3\xbashin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow intolerable! He is continually interrupting.... Who does not like\r\nflattery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more final question,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Mal\xc3\xa9vsky:--\xe2\x80\x9cHas the Queen a\r\nhusband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not thought about that. No, why should she have a husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d--assented Mal\xc3\xa9vsky;--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy should she have a husband?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSilence!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed, in English, Maid\xc3\xa1noff, who spoke French badly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Merci_,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Zina\xc3\xadda to him.--\xe2\x80\x9cSo then, the Queen listens to those\r\nspeeches, listens to the music, but does not look at a single one of the\r\nguests. Six windows are open from top to bottom, from ceiling to floor,\r\nand behind them are the dark sky with great stars and the dark garden\r\nwith huge trees. The Queen gazes into the garden. There, near the trees\r\nis a fountain: it gleams white athwart the gloom--long, as long as a\r\nspectre. The Queen hears the quiet plashing of its waters in the midst\r\nof the conversation and the music. She gazes and thinks: \xe2\x80\x98All of you\r\ngentlemen are noble, clever, wealthy; you are all ready to die at my\r\nfeet, I rule over you; ... but yonder, by the side of the fountain, by\r\nthe side of that plashing water, there is standing and waiting for me\r\nthe man whom I love, who rules over me. He wears no rich garments, nor\r\nprecious jewels; no one knows him; but he is waiting for me, and is\r\nconvinced that I shall come--and I shall come, and there is no power in\r\nexistence which can stop me when I wish to go to him and remain with\r\nhim and lose myself with him yonder, in the gloom of the park, beneath\r\nthe rustling of the trees, beneath the plashing of the fountain....\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda ceased speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that an invention?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked Mal\xc3\xa9vsky slyly.\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda did not even glance at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what should we do, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d--suddenly spoke up L\xc3\xbashin,--\xe2\x80\x9cif we\r\nwere among the guests and knew about that lucky man by the fountain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay, stay,\xe2\x80\x9d--interposed Zina\xc3\xadda:--\xe2\x80\x9cI myself will tell you what each\r\none of you would do. You, Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff, would challenge him to a duel;\r\nyou, Maid\xc3\xa1noff, would write an epigram on him.... But no--you do not\r\nknow how to write epigrams; you would compose a long iambic poem on him,\r\nafter the style of Barbier, and would insert your production in the\r\n_Telegraph_. You, Nirm\xc3\xa1tzky, would borrow from him ... no, you would\r\nlend him money on interest; you, doctor....\xe2\x80\x9d She paused.... \xe2\x80\x9cI really do\r\nnot know about you,--what you would do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my capacity of Court-physician,\xe2\x80\x9d replied L\xc3\xbashin, \xe2\x80\x9cI would advise the\r\nQueen not to give balls when she did not feel in the mood for\r\nguests....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you would be in the right. And you, Count?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I?\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Mal\xc3\xa9vsky, with an evil smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you would offer him some poisoned sugar-plums.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMal\xc3\xa9vsky\xe2\x80\x99s face writhed a little and assumed for a moment a Jewish\r\nexpression; but he immediately burst into a guffaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs for you, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar....\xe2\x80\x9d went on Zina\xc3\xadda,--\xe2\x80\x9cbut enough of this;\r\nlet us play at some other game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x99sieu Voldemar, in his capacity of page to the Queen, would hold up\r\nher train when she ran off into the park,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Mal\xc3\xa9vsky viciously.\r\n\r\nI flared up, but Zina\xc3\xadda swiftly laid her hand on my shoulder and\r\nrising, said in a slightly tremulous voice:--\xe2\x80\x9cI have never given Your\r\nRadiance the right to be insolent, and therefore I beg that you will\r\nwithdraw.\xe2\x80\x9d--She pointed him to the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave mercy, Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d--mumbled Mal\xc3\xa9vsky, turning pale all over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Princess is right,\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff, rising to his feet\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy God! I never in the least expected this,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on Mal\xc3\xa9vsky:--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthink there was nothing in my words which.... I had no intention of\r\noffending you.... Forgive me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda surveyed him with a cold glance, and smiled coldly.--\xe2\x80\x9cRemain, if\r\nyou like,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, with a careless wave of her hand.--\xe2\x80\x9cM\xe2\x80\x99sieu\r\nVoldemar and I have taken offence without cause. You find it merry to\r\njest.... I wish you well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Mal\xc3\xa9vsky once more; and I, recalling Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmovement, thought again that a real queen could not have ordered an\r\ninsolent man out of the room with more majesty.\r\n\r\nThe game of forfeits did not continue long after this little scene; all\r\nfelt somewhat awkward, not so much in consequence of the scene itself as\r\nfrom another, not entirely defined, but oppressive sensation. No one\r\nalluded to it, but each one was conscious of its existence within\r\nhimself and in his neighbour. Maid\xc3\xa1noff recited to us all his poems--and\r\nMal\xc3\xa9vsky lauded them with exaggerated warmth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow hard he is trying to appear amiable now,\xe2\x80\x9d--L\xc3\xbashin whispered to me.\r\n\r\nWe soon dispersed. Zina\xc3\xadda had suddenly grown pensive; the old Princess\r\nsent word that she had a headache; Nirm\xc3\xa1tzky began to complain of his\r\nrheumatism....\r\n\r\nFor a long time I could not get to sleep; Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s narrative had\r\nimpressed me.--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that it contains a hint?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked\r\nmyself:--\xe2\x80\x9cand at whom was she hinting? And if there really is some one\r\nto hint about ... what must I decide to do? No, no, it cannot be,\xe2\x80\x9d--I\r\nwhispered, turning over from one burning cheek to the other.... But I\r\ncalled to mind the expression of Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s face during her narration....\r\nI called to mind the exclamation which had broken from L\xc3\xbashin in the\r\nNesk\xc3\xbatchny Park, the sudden changes in her treatment of me--and lost\r\nmyself in conjectures. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is he?\xe2\x80\x9d Those three words seemed to stand in\r\nfront of my eyes, outlined in the darkness; a low-lying, ominous cloud\r\nseemed to be hanging over me--and I felt its pressure--and waited every\r\nmoment for it to burst. I had grown used to many things of late; I had\r\nseen many things at the Zasy\xc3\xa9kins\xe2\x80\x99; their disorderliness, tallow\r\ncandle-ends, broken knives and forks, gloomy Vonif\xc3\xa1ty, the shabby maids,\r\nthe manners of the old Princess herself,--all that strange life no\r\nlonger surprised me.... But to that which I now dimly felt in Zina\xc3\xadda I\r\ncould not get used.... \xe2\x80\x9cAn adventuress,\xe2\x80\x9d--my mother had one day said\r\nconcerning her. An adventuress--she, my idol, my divinity! That\r\nappellation seared me; I tried to escape from it by burrowing into my\r\npillow; I raged--and at the same time, to what would not I have agreed,\r\nwhat would not I have given, if only I might be that happy mortal by the\r\nfountain!...\r\n\r\nMy blood grew hot and seethed within me. \xe2\x80\x9cA garden ... a fountain,\xe2\x80\x9d ...\r\nI thought.... \xe2\x80\x9cI will go into the garden.\xe2\x80\x9d I dressed myself quickly and\r\nslipped out of the house. The night was dark, the trees were barely\r\nwhispering; a quiet chill was descending from the sky, an odour of\r\nfennel was wafted from the vegetable-garden. I made the round of all the\r\nalleys; the light sound of my footsteps both disconcerted me and gave me\r\ncourage; I halted, waiting and listening to hear how my heart was\r\nbeating quickly and violently. At last I approached the fence and leaned\r\nagainst a slender post. All at once--or was it only my imagination?--a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s figure flitted past a few paces distant from me.... I strained\r\nmy eyes intently on the darkness; I held my breath. What was this? Was\r\nit footsteps that I heard or was it the thumping of my heart\r\nagain?--\xe2\x80\x9cWho is here?\xe2\x80\x9d--I stammered in barely audible tones. What was\r\nthat again? A suppressed laugh?... or a rustling in the leaves?... or a\r\nsigh close to my very ear? I was terrified.... \xe2\x80\x9cWho is here?\xe2\x80\x9d--I\r\nrepeated, in a still lower voice.\r\n\r\nThe breeze began to flutter for a moment; a fiery band flashed across\r\nthe sky; a star shot down.--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Zina\xc3\xadda?\xe2\x80\x9d--I tried to ask, but the\r\nsound died on my lips. And suddenly everything became profoundly silent\r\nall around, as often happens in the middle of the night.... Even the\r\nkatydids ceased to shrill in the trees; only a window rattled somewhere.\r\nI stood and stood, then returned to my chamber, to my cold bed. I felt a\r\nstrange agitation--exactly as though I had gone to a tryst, and had\r\nremained alone, and had passed by some one else\xe2\x80\x99s happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nThe next day I caught only a glimpse of Zina\xc3\xadda; she drove away\r\nsomewhere with the old Princess in a hired carriage. On the other hand,\r\nI saw L\xc3\xbashin--who, however, barely deigned to bestow a greeting on\r\nme--and Mal\xc3\xa9vsky. The young Count grinned and entered into conversation\r\nwith me in friendly wise. Among all the visitors to the wing he alone\r\nhad managed to effect an entrance to our house, and my mother had taken\r\na fancy to him. My father did not favour him and treated him politely to\r\nthe point of insult.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, _monsieur le page_,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Mal\xc3\xa9vsky,--\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to meet you.\r\nWhat is your beauteous queen doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis fresh, handsome face was so repulsive to me at that moment, and he\r\nlooked at me with such a scornfully-playful stare, that I made him no\r\nanswer whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still in a bad humour?\xe2\x80\x9d--he went on.--\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no occasion for\r\nit. It was not I, you know, who called you a page; and pages are chiefly\r\nwith queens. But permit me to observe to you that you are fulfilling\r\nyour duties badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPages ought to be inseparable from their sovereigns; pages ought to\r\nknow everything that they do; they ought even to watch over them,\xe2\x80\x9d--he\r\nadded, lowering his voice,--\xe2\x80\x9cday and night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I mean? I think I have expressed myself plainly. Day--and\r\nnight. It does not matter so much about the day; by day it is light and\r\nthere are people about; but by night--that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the time to expect\r\na catastrophe. I advise you not to sleep o\xe2\x80\x99nights and to watch, watch\r\nwith all your might. Remember--in a garden, by night, near the\r\nfountain--that\xe2\x80\x99s where you must keep guard. You will thank me for this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMal\xc3\xa9vsky laughed and turned his back on me. He did not, in all\r\nprobability, attribute any special importance to what he had said to me;\r\nhe bore the reputation of being a capital hand at mystification, and was\r\nrenowned for his cleverness in fooling people at the masquerades, in\r\nwhich that almost unconscious disposition to lie, wherewith his whole\r\nbeing was permeated, greatly aided him.... He had merely wished to tease\r\nme; but every word of his trickled like poison through all my\r\nveins.--The blood flew to my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! so that\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d--I said to myself:--\xe2\x80\x9cgood! So it was not for nothing\r\nthat I felt drawn to the garden! That shall not be!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed,\r\nsmiting myself on the breast with my fist; although I really did not\r\nknow what it was that I was determined not to permit.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhether Mal\xc3\xa9vsky\r\nhimself comes into the garden,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought (perhaps he had blurted out a\r\nsecret; he was insolent enough for that),--\xe2\x80\x9cor some one else,\xe2\x80\x9d--(the\r\nfence of our vegetable-garden was very low and it cost no effort to\r\nclimb over it)--\xe2\x80\x9cat any rate, it will be all the worse for the person\r\nwhom I catch! I would not advise any one to encounter me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll show the\r\nwhole world and her, the traitress,\xe2\x80\x9d--(I actually called her a\r\ntraitress)--\xe2\x80\x9cthat I know how to avenge myself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI returned to my own room, took out of my writing-table a recently\r\npurchased English knife, felt of the sharp blade, and, knitting my\r\nbrows, thrust it into my pocket with a cold and concentrated decision,\r\nexactly as though it was nothing remarkable for me to do such deeds, and\r\nthis was not the first occasion. My heart swelled angrily within me and\r\ngrew stony; I did not unbend my brows until nightfall and did not relax\r\nmy lips, and kept striding back and forth, clutching the knife which had\r\ngrown warm in my pocket, and preparing myself in advance for something\r\nterrible. These new, unprecedented emotions so engrossed and even\r\ncheered me, that I thought very little about Zina\xc3\xadda herself. There kept\r\nconstantly flitting through my head Aleko, the young gipsy:[6]--\xe2\x80\x9cWhere\r\nart thou going, handsome youth?--Lie down....\xe2\x80\x9d and then: \xe2\x80\x9cThou\xe2\x80\x99rt all\r\nwith blood bespattered!... Oh, what is\xe2\x80\x99t that thou hast done?...\r\nNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d With what a harsh smile I repeated that: that \xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy father was not at home; but my mother, who for some time past had\r\nbeen in a state of almost constant, dull irritation, noticed my baleful\r\naspect at supper, and said to me:--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat art thou sulking at, like a\r\nmouse at groats?\xe2\x80\x9d--I merely smiled patronisingly at her by way of reply\r\nand thought to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cIf they only knew!\xe2\x80\x9d--The clock struck eleven; I\r\nwent to my own room but did not undress; I was waiting for midnight; at\r\nlast it struck.--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis time!\xe2\x80\x9d--I hissed between my teeth, and buttoning\r\nmy coat to the throat and even turning up my sleeves I betook myself to\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nI had selected a place beforehand where I meant to stand on guard. At\r\nthe end of the garden, at the spot where the fence, which separated our\r\nproperty from the Zasy\xc3\xa9kins\xe2\x80\x99, abutted on the party-wall, grew a solitary\r\nspruce-tree. Standing beneath its low, thick branches, I could see well,\r\nas far as the nocturnal gloom permitted, all that went on around; there\r\nalso meandered a path which always seemed to me mysterious; like a\r\nserpent it wound under the fence, which at that point bore traces of\r\nclambering feet, and led to an arbour of dense acacias. I reached the\r\nspruce-tree, leaned against its trunk and began my watch.\r\n\r\nThe night was as tranquil as the preceding one had been; but there were\r\nfewer storm-clouds in the sky, and the outlines of the bushes, even of\r\nthe tall flowers, were more plainly discernible. The first moments of\r\nwaiting were wearisome, almost terrible. I had made up my mind to\r\neverything; I was merely considering how I ought to act. Ought I to\r\nthunder out: \xe2\x80\x9cWho goes there? Halt! Confess--or die!\xe2\x80\x9d--or simply\r\nsmite.... Every sound, every noise and rustling seemed to me\r\nsignificant, unusual.... I made ready.... I bent forward.... But half an\r\nhour, an hour, elapsed; my blood quieted down and turned cold; the\r\nconsciousness that I was doing all this in vain, that I was even\r\nsomewhat ridiculous, that Mal\xc3\xa9vsky had been making fun of me, began to\r\nsteal into my soul. I abandoned my ambush and made the round of the\r\nentire garden. As though expressly, not the slightest sound was to be\r\nheard anywhere; everything was at rest; even our dog was asleep, curled\r\nup in a ball at the gate. I climbed up on the ruin of the hothouse,\r\nbeheld before me the distant plain, recalled my meeting with Zina\xc3\xadda,\r\nand became immersed in meditation....\r\n\r\nI started.... I thought I heard the creak of an opening door, then the\r\nlight crackling of a broken twig. In two bounds I had descended from\r\nthe ruin--and stood petrified on the spot. Swift, light but cautious\r\nfootsteps were plainly audible in the garden. They were coming toward\r\nme. \xe2\x80\x9cHere he is.... Here he is, at last!\xe2\x80\x9d--darted through my heart. I\r\nconvulsively jerked the knife out of my pocket, convulsively opened\r\nit--red sparks whirled before my eyes, the hair stood up on my head with\r\nfright and wrath.... The steps were coming straight toward me--I bent\r\nover, and went to meet them.... A man made his appearance.... My God! It\r\nwas my father!\r\n\r\nI recognised him instantly, although he was all enveloped in a dark\r\ncloak,--and had pulled his hat down over his face. He went past me on\r\ntiptoe. He did not notice me although nothing concealed me; but I had so\r\ncontracted myself and shrunk together that I think I must have been on a\r\nlevel with the ground. The jealous Othello, prepared to murder, had\r\nsuddenly been converted into the school-boy.... I was so frightened by\r\nthe unexpected apparition of my father that I did not even take note, at\r\nfirst, in what direction he was going and where he had disappeared. I\r\nmerely straightened up at the moment and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is my father\r\nwalking in the garden by night?\xe2\x80\x9d--when everything around had relapsed\r\ninto silence. In my alarm I had dropped my knife in the grass, but I did\r\nnot even try to find it; I felt very much ashamed. I became sobered on\r\nthe instant. But as I wended my way home, I stepped up to my little\r\nbench under the elder-bush and cast a glance at the little window of\r\nZina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s chamber. The small, somewhat curved panes of the little window\r\ngleamed dully blue in the faint light which fell from the night sky.\r\nSuddenly their colour began to undergo a change.... Behind them--I saw\r\nit, saw it clearly,--a whitish shade was lowered, descended to the\r\nsill,--and there remained motionless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the meaning of that?\xe2\x80\x9d--I said aloud, almost involuntarily, when\r\nI again found myself in my own room.--\xe2\x80\x9cWas it a dream, an accident,\r\nor....\xe2\x80\x9d The surmises which suddenly came into my head were so new and\r\nstrange that I dared not even yield to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nI rose in the morning with a headache. My agitation of the night before\r\nhad vanished. It had been replaced by an oppressive perplexity and a\r\ncertain, hitherto unknown sadness,--exactly as though something had died\r\nin me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes you look like a rabbit which has had half of its brain\r\nremoved?\xe2\x80\x9d--said L\xc3\xbashin, who happened to meet me. At breakfast I kept\r\ncasting covert glances now at my father, now at my mother; he was calm,\r\nas usual; she, as usual, was secretly irritated. I waited to see\r\nwhether my father would address me in a friendly way, as he sometimes\r\ndid.... But he did not even caress me with his cold, everyday\r\naffection.--\xe2\x80\x9cShall I tell Zina\xc3\xadda all?\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought.... \xe2\x80\x9cFor it makes no\r\ndifference now--everything is over between us.\xe2\x80\x9d I went to her, but I not\r\nonly did not tell her anything,--I did not even get a chance to talk to\r\nher as I would have liked. The old Princess\xe2\x80\x99s son, a cadet aged twelve,\r\nhad come from Petersburg to spend his vacation with her; Zina\xc3\xadda\r\nimmediately confided her brother to me.--\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my dear Vol\xc3\xb3dya,\xe2\x80\x9d--said\r\nshe (she called me so for the first time), \xe2\x80\x9cis a comrade for you. His\r\nname is Vol\xc3\xb3dya also. Pray, like him; he\xe2\x80\x99s a wild little fellow still,\r\nbut he has a good heart. Show him Nesk\xc3\xbatchny Park, walk with him, take\r\nhim under your protection. You will do that, will you not? You, too, are\r\nsuch a good fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d--She laid both hands affectionately on my\r\nshoulder--and I was reduced to utter confusion. The arrival of that boy\r\nturned me into a boy. I stared in silence at the cadet, who riveted his\r\neyes in corresponding silence on me. Zina\xc3\xadda burst out laughing and\r\npushed us toward each other.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome, embrace, children!\xe2\x80\x9d--We\r\nembraced.--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take you into the garden if you wish,--shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d--I\r\nasked the cadet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--he replied, in a hoarse, genuine cadet voice. Again\r\nZina\xc3\xadda indulged in a burst of laughter.... I managed to notice that\r\nnever before had she had such charming colour in her face. The cadet and\r\nI went off together. In our garden stood an old swing. I seated him on\r\nthe thin little board and began to swing him. He sat motionless in his\r\nnew little uniform of thick cloth with broad gold galloon, and clung\r\ntightly to the ropes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better unhook your collar,\xe2\x80\x9d--I said to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind, sir,[7] we are used to it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said, and cleared his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nHe resembled his sister; his eyes were particularly suggestive of her.\r\nIt was pleasant to me to be of service to him; and, at the same time,\r\nthat aching pain kept quietly gnawing at my heart. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I really am a\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought; \xe2\x80\x9cbut last night....\xe2\x80\x9d I remembered where I had dropped\r\nmy knife and found it. The cadet asked me to lend it to him, plucked a\r\nthick stalk of lovage, cut a whistle from it, and began to pipe. Othello\r\npiped also.\r\n\r\nBut in the evening, on the other hand, how he did weep, that same\r\nOthello, over Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s hands when, having sought him out in a corner of\r\nthe garden, she asked him what made him so melancholy. My tears streamed\r\nwith such violence that she was frightened.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with\r\nyou? What is the matter with you, Vol\xc3\xb3dya?\xe2\x80\x9d--she kept repeating, and\r\nseeing that I made her no reply, she took it into her head to kiss my\r\nwet cheek. But I turned away from her and whispered through my sobs:--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow everything: why have you trifled with me?... Why did you want my\r\nlove?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to blame toward you, Vol\xc3\xb3dya\xe2\x80\x9d ... said Zina\xc3\xadda.--\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, I am very\r\nmuch to blame\xe2\x80\x9d ... she said, and clenched her hands.--\xe2\x80\x9cHow much evil,\r\ndark, sinful, there is in me!... But I am not trifling with you now, I\r\nlove you--you do not suspect why and how.... But what is it you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat could I say to her? She stood before me and gazed at me--and I\r\nbelonged to her wholly, from head to foot, as soon as she looked at\r\nme.... A quarter of an hour later I was running a race with the cadet\r\nand Zina\xc3\xadda; I was not weeping; I was laughing, although my swollen\r\neyelids dropped tears from laughing; on my neck, in place of a tie, was\r\nbound a ribbon of Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s, and I shouted with joy when I succeeded in\r\nseizing her round the waist. She did with me whatsoever she would.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nI should be hard put to it, if I were made to narrate in detail all that\r\nwent on within me in the course of the week which followed my\r\nunsuccessful nocturnal expedition. It was a strange, feverish time, a\r\nsort of chaos in which the most opposite emotions, thoughts, suspicions,\r\nhopes, joys, and sufferings revolved in a whirlwind; I was afraid to\r\nlook into myself, if a sixteen-year-old can look into himself; I was\r\nafraid to account to myself for anything whatsoever; I simply made haste\r\nto live through the day until the evening; on the other hand, at night I\r\nslept ... childish giddiness helped me. I did not want to know whether I\r\nwas beloved, and would not admit to myself that I was not beloved; I\r\nshunned my father--but could not shun Zina\xc3\xadda.... I burned as with fire\r\nin her presence, ... but what was the use of my knowing what sort of\r\nfire it was wherewith I burned and melted--seeing that it was sweet to\r\nme to burn and melt! I surrendered myself entirely to my impressions,\r\nand dealt artfully with myself, turned away from my memories and shut my\r\neyes to that of which I had a presentiment in the future.... This\r\nanguish probably would not have continued long ... a thunder-clap put an\r\ninstantaneous end to everything and hurled me into a new course.\r\n\r\nOn returning home one day to dinner from a rather long walk, I learned\r\nwith surprise that I was to dine alone; that my father had gone away,\r\nwhile my mother was ill, did not wish to dine and had shut herself up in\r\nher bedroom. From the footmen\xe2\x80\x99s faces I divined that something unusual\r\nhad taken place.... I dared not interrogate them, but I had a friend,\r\nthe young butler Phil\xc3\xadpp, who was passionately fond of poetry and an\r\nartist on the guitar; I applied to him. From him I learned that a\r\nfrightful scene had taken place between my father and mother (for in the\r\nmaids\xe2\x80\x99 room everything was audible, to the last word; a great deal had\r\nbeen said in French, but the maid M\xc3\xa1sha had lived for five years with a\r\ndressmaker from Paris and understood it all); that my mother had accused\r\nmy father of infidelity, of being intimate with the young lady our\r\nneighbour; that my father had first defended himself, then had flared up\r\nand in his turn had made some harsh remark \xe2\x80\x9cseemingly about her age,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich had set my mother to crying; that my mother had also referred to a\r\nnote of hand, which appeared to have been given to the old Princess, and\r\nexpressed herself very vilely about her, and about the young lady as\r\nwell; and that then my father had threatened her.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the whole\r\ntrouble arose,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued Phil\xc3\xadpp, \xe2\x80\x9cout of an anonymous letter; but who\r\nwrote it no one knows; otherwise there was no reason why this affair\r\nshould have come out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut has there been anything?\xe2\x80\x9d--I enunciated with difficulty, while my\r\nhands and feet turned cold, and something began to quiver in the very\r\ndepths of my breast.\r\n\r\nPhil\xc3\xadpp winked significantly.--\xe2\x80\x9cThere has. You can\xe2\x80\x99t conceal such\r\ndoings, cautious as your papa has been in this case;--still, what\r\npossessed him, for example, to hire a carriage, or to ... for you can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget along without people there also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dismissed Phil\xc3\xadpp, and flung myself down on my bed. I did not sob, I\r\ndid not give myself up to despair; I did not ask myself when and how all\r\nthis had taken place; I was not surprised that I had not guessed it\r\nsooner, long before--I did not even murmur against my father.... That\r\nwhich I had learned was beyond my strength; this sudden discovery had\r\ncrushed me.... All was over. All my flowers had been plucked up at one\r\nblow and lay strewn around me, scattered and trampled under foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nOn the following day my mother announced that she was going to remove to\r\ntown. My father went into her bedroom in the morning and sat there a\r\nlong time alone with her. No one heard what he said to her, but my\r\nmother did not weep any more; she calmed down and asked for something to\r\neat, but did not show herself and did not alter her intention. I\r\nremember that I wandered about all day long, but did not go into the\r\ngarden and did not glance even once at the wing--and in the evening I\r\nwas the witness of an amazing occurrence; my father took Count Mal\xc3\xa9vsky\r\nby the arm and led him out of the hall into the anteroom and, in the\r\npresence of a lackey, said coldly to him: \xe2\x80\x9cSeveral days ago Your\r\nRadiance was shown the door in a certain house. I shall not enter into\r\nexplanations with you now, but I have the honour to inform you that if\r\nyou come to my house again I shall fling you through the window. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike your handwriting.\xe2\x80\x9d The Count bowed, set his teeth, shrank together,\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nPreparations began for removing to town, on the Arb\xc3\xa1t,[8] where our\r\nhouse was situated. Probably my father himself no longer cared to remain\r\nin the villa; but it was evident that he had succeeded in persuading my\r\nmother not to make a row. Everything was done quietly, without haste; my\r\nmother even sent her compliments to the old Princess and expressed her\r\nregret that, owing to ill-health, she would be unable to see her before\r\nher departure. I prowled about like a crazy person, and desired but one\r\nthing,--that everything might come to an end as speedily as possible.\r\nOne thought never quitted my head: how could she, a young girl,--well,\r\nand a princess into the bargain,--bring herself to such a step, knowing\r\nthat my father was not a free man while she had the possibility of\r\nmarrying Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff at least, for example? What had she hoped for?\r\nHow was it that she had not been afraid to ruin her whole\r\nfuture?--\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what love is,--that is\r\npassion,--that is devotion,\xe2\x80\x9d ... and I recalled L\xc3\xbashin\xe2\x80\x99s words to me:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSelf-sacrifice is sweet--for some people.\xe2\x80\x9d Once I happened to catch\r\nsight of a white spot in one of the windows of the wing.... \xe2\x80\x9cCan that be\r\nZina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s face?\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought; ... and it really was her face. I could not\r\nhold out. I could not part from her without bidding her a last farewell.\r\nI seized a convenient moment and betook myself to the wing.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room the old Princess received me with her customary,\r\nslovenly-careless greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has made your folks uneasy so early, my dear fellow?\xe2\x80\x9d--she said,\r\nstuffing snuff up both her nostrils. I looked at her, and a weight was\r\nremoved from my heart. The word \xe2\x80\x9cnote of hand\xe2\x80\x9d uttered by Phil\xc3\xadpp\r\ntormented me. She suspected nothing ... so it seemed to me then, at\r\nleast. Zina\xc3\xadda made her appearance from the adjoining room in a black\r\ngown, pale, with hair out of curl; she silently took me by the hand and\r\nled me away to her room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard your voice,\xe2\x80\x9d--she began,--\xe2\x80\x9cand came out at once. And did you\r\nfind it so easy to desert us, naughty boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to take leave of you, Princess,\xe2\x80\x9d--I replied,--\xe2\x80\x9cprobably\r\nforever. You may have heard we are going away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nZina\xc3\xadda gazed intently at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have heard. Thank you for coming. I was beginning to think that\r\nI should not see you.--Think kindly of me. I have sometimes tormented\r\nyou; but nevertheless I am not the sort of person you think I am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned away and leaned against the window-casing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I am not that sort of person. I know that you have a bad\r\nopinion of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you ... you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI?\xe2\x80\x9d--I repeated sorrowfully, and my heart began to quiver as of old,\r\nbeneath the influence of the irresistible, inexpressible witchery.--\xe2\x80\x9cI?\r\nBelieve me, Zina\xc3\xadda Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, whatever you may have done, however\r\nyou may have tormented me, I shall love and adore you until the end of\r\nmy life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned swiftly toward me and opening her arms widely, she clasped my\r\nhead, and kissed me heartily and warmly. God knows whom that long,\r\nfarewell kiss was seeking, but I eagerly tasted its sweetness. I knew\r\nthat it would never more be repeated.--\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d I kept\r\nsaying....\r\n\r\nShe wrenched herself away and left the room. And I withdrew also. I am\r\nunable to describe the feeling with which I retired. I should not wish\r\never to have it repeated; but I should consider myself unhappy if I had\r\nnever experienced it.\r\n\r\nWe removed to town. I did not speedily detach myself from the past, I\r\ndid not speedily take up my work. My wound healed slowly; but I really\r\nhad no evil feeling toward my father. On the contrary, he seemed to have\r\ngained in stature in my eyes ... let the psychologists explain this\r\ncontradiction as best they may. One day I was walking along the\r\nboulevard when, to my indescribable joy, I encountered L\xc3\xbashin. I liked\r\nhim for his straightforward, sincere character; and, moreover, he was\r\ndear to me in virtue of the memories which he awakened in me. I rushed\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d--he said, with a scowl.--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it you, young man? Come, let me have\r\na look at you. You are still all sallow, and yet there is not the olden\r\ntrash in your eyes. You look like a man, not like a lap-dog. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngood. Well, and how are you? Are you working?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI heaved a sigh. I did not wish to lie, and I was ashamed to tell the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, never mind,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on L\xc3\xbashin,--\xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid. The principal\r\nthing is to live in normal fashion and not to yield to impulses.\r\nOtherwise, where\xe2\x80\x99s the good? No matter whither the wave bears one--\xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nbad; let a man stand on a stone if need be, but on his own feet. Here I\r\nam croaking ... but Byelovz\xc3\xb3roff--have you heard about him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about him? No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has disappeared without leaving a trace; they say he has gone to the\r\nCaucasus. A lesson to you, young man. And the whole thing arises from\r\nnot knowing how to say good-bye,--to break bonds in time. You, now, seem\r\nto have jumped out successfully. Look out, don\xe2\x80\x99t fall in again.\r\nFarewell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not fall in,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought.... \xe2\x80\x9cI shall see her no more.\xe2\x80\x9d But I\r\nwas fated to see Zina\xc3\xadda once more.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nMy father was in the habit of riding on horseback every day; he had a\r\nsplendid red-roan English horse, with a long, slender neck and long\r\nlegs, indefatigable and vicious. Its name was Electric. No one could\r\nride it except my father. One day he came to me in a kindly frame of\r\nmind, which had not happened with him for a long time: he was preparing\r\nto ride, and had donned his spurs. I began to entreat him to take me\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us, rather, play at leap-frog,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied my father,--\xe2\x80\x9cfor thou wilt\r\nnot be able to keep up with me on thy cob.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I shall; I will put on spurs also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come along.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe set out. I had a shaggy, black little horse, strong on its feet and\r\nfairly spirited; it had to gallop with all its might, it is true, when\r\nElectric was going at a full trot; but nevertheless I did not fall\r\nbehind. I have never seen such a horseman as my father. His seat was so\r\nfine and so carelessly-adroit that the horse under him seemed to be\r\nconscious of it and to take pride in it. We rode the whole length of all\r\nthe boulevards, reached the Maidens\xe2\x80\x99 Field,[9] leaped over several\r\nenclosures (at first I was afraid to leap, but my father despised timid\r\npeople, and I ceased to be afraid), crossed the Moscow river twice;--and\r\nI was beginning to think that we were on our way homeward, the more so\r\nas my father remarked that my horse was tired, when suddenly he turned\r\naway from me in the direction of the Crimean Ford, and galloped along\r\nthe shore.--I dashed after him. When he came on a level with a lofty\r\npile of old beams which lay heaped together, he sprang nimbly from\r\nElectric, ordered me to alight and, handing me the bridle of his horse,\r\ntold me to wait for him on that spot, near the beams; then he turned\r\ninto a narrow alley and disappeared. I began to pace back and forth\r\nalong the shore, leading the horses after me and scolding Electric, who\r\nas he walked kept incessantly twitching his head, shaking himself,\r\nsnorting and neighing; when I stood still, he alternately pawed the\r\nearth with his hoof, and squealed and bit my cob on the neck; in a word,\r\nbehaved like a spoiled darling, _pur sang_. My father did not return. A\r\ndisagreeable humidity was wafted from the river; a fine rain set in and\r\nmottled the stupid, grey beams, around which I was hovering and of which\r\nI was so heartily tired, with tiny, dark spots. Anxiety took possession\r\nof me, but still my father did not come. A Finnish sentry, also all\r\ngrey, with a huge, old-fashioned shako, in the form of a pot, on his\r\nhead, and armed with a halberd (why should there be a sentry, I thought,\r\non the shores of the Moscow river?), approached me, and turning his\r\nelderly, wrinkled face to me, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here with those horses, my little gentleman? Hand\r\nthem over to me; I\xe2\x80\x99ll hold them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI did not answer him; he asked me for some tobacco. In order to rid\r\nmyself of him (moreover, I was tortured by impatience), I advanced a few\r\npaces in the direction in which my father had retreated; then I walked\r\nthrough the alley to the very end, turned a corner, and came to a\r\nstandstill. On the street, forty paces distant from me, in front of the\r\nopen window of a small wooden house, with his back to me, stood my\r\nfather; he was leaning his breast on the window-sill, while in the\r\nhouse, half concealed by the curtain, sat a woman in a dark gown talking\r\nwith my father: the woman was Zina\xc3\xadda.\r\n\r\nI stood rooted to the spot in amazement. I must confess that I had in\r\nnowise expected this. My first impulse was to flee. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father will\r\nglance round,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought,--\xe2\x80\x9cand then I am lost.\xe2\x80\x9d... But a strange\r\nfeeling--a feeling more powerful than curiosity, more powerful even than\r\njealousy, more powerful than fear,--stopped me. I began to stare, I\r\ntried to hear. My father appeared to be insisting upon something.\r\nZina\xc3\xadda would not consent. I seem to see her face now--sad, serious,\r\nbeautiful, and with an indescribable imprint of adoration, grief, love,\r\nand a sort of despair. She uttered monosyllabic words, did not raise her\r\neyes, and only smiled--submissively and obstinately. From that smile\r\nalone I recognised my former Zina\xc3\xadda. My father shrugged his shoulders,\r\nand set his hat straight on his head--which was always a sign of\r\nimpatience with him.... Then the words became audible: \xe2\x80\x9c_Vous devez vous\r\ns\xc3\xa9parer de cette._\xe2\x80\x9d... Zina\xc3\xadda drew herself up and stretched out her\r\nhand.... Suddenly, before my very eyes, an incredible thing came to\r\npass:--all at once, my father raised the riding-whip, with which he had\r\nbeen lashing the dust from his coat-tails,--and the sound of a sharp\r\nblow on that arm, which was bare to the elbow, rang out. I could hardly\r\nkeep from shrieking, but Zina\xc3\xadda started, gazed in silence at my father,\r\nand slowly raising her arm to her lips, kissed the mark which glowed\r\nscarlet upon it.\r\n\r\nMy father hurled his riding-whip from him, and running hastily up the\r\nsteps of the porch, burst into the house.... Zina\xc3\xadda turned round, and\r\nstretching out her arms, and throwing back her head, she also quitted\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nMy heart swooning with terror, and with a sort of alarmed perplexity, I\r\ndarted backward; and dashing through the alley, and almost letting go of\r\nElectric, I returned to the bank of the river.... I could understand\r\nnothing. I knew that my cold and self-contained father was sometimes\r\nseized by fits of wild fury; and yet I could not in the least comprehend\r\nwhat I had seen.... But I immediately felt that no matter how long I\r\nmight live, it would be impossible for me ever to forget that movement,\r\nZina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s glance and smile; that her image, that new image which had\r\nsuddenly been presented to me, had forever imprinted itself on my\r\nmemory. I stared stupidly at the river and did not notice that my tears\r\nwere flowing. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is being beaten,\xe2\x80\x9d--I thought.... \xe2\x80\x9cShe is being beaten\r\n... beaten....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, what ails thee?--Give me my horse!\xe2\x80\x9d--rang out my father\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\nI mechanically gave him the bridle. He sprang upon Electric ... the\r\nhalf-frozen horse reared on his hind legs and leaped forward half a\r\nfathom ... but my father speedily got him under control; he dug his\r\nspurs into his flanks and beat him on the neck with his fist.... \xe2\x80\x9cEkh, I\r\nhave no whip,\xe2\x80\x9d--he muttered.\r\n\r\nI remembered the recent swish through the air and the blow of that same\r\nwhip, and shuddered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat hast thou done with it?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked my father, after waiting a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nMy father did not answer me and galloped on. I dashed after him. I was\r\ndetermined to get a look at his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidst thou get bored in my absence?\xe2\x80\x9d--he said through his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA little. But where didst thou drop thy whip?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked him again.\r\n\r\nMy father shot a swift glance at me.--\xe2\x80\x9cI did not drop it,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said,--\xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nthrew it away.\xe2\x80\x9d--He reflected for a space and dropped his head ... and\r\nthen, for the first and probably for the last time, I saw how much\r\ntenderness and compunction his stern features were capable of\r\nexpressing.\r\n\r\nHe set off again at a gallop, and this time I could not keep up with\r\nhim; I reached home a quarter of an hour after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what love is,\xe2\x80\x9d--I said to myself again, as I sat at night before\r\nmy writing-table, on which copy-books and text-books had already begun\r\nto make their appearance,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat is what passion is!... How is it\r\npossible not to revolt, how is it possible to endure a blow from any one\r\nwhomsoever ... even from the hand that is most dear? But evidently it\r\ncan be done if one is in love.... And I ... I imagined....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last month had aged me greatly, and my love, with all its agitations\r\nand sufferings, seemed to me like something very petty and childish and\r\nwretched in comparison with that other unknown something at which I\r\ncould hardly even guess, and which frightened me like a strange,\r\nbeautiful but menacing face that one strives, in vain, to get a good\r\nlook at in the semi-darkness....\r\n\r\nThat night I had a strange and dreadful dream. I thought I was entering\r\na low, dark room.... My father was standing there, riding-whip in hand,\r\nand stamping his feet; Zina\xc3\xadda was crouching in one corner and had a red\r\nmark, not on her arm, but on her forehead ... and behind the two rose up\r\nByelovz\xc3\xb3roff, all bathed in blood, with his pale lips open, and\r\nwrathfully menacing my father.\r\n\r\nTwo months later I entered the university, and six months afterward my\r\nfather died (of an apoplectic stroke) in Petersburg, whither he had just\r\nremoved with my mother and myself. A few days before his death my father\r\nhad received a letter from Moscow which had agitated him extremely....\r\nHe went to beg something of my mother and, I was told, even wept,--he,\r\nmy father! On the very morning of the day on which he had the stroke, he\r\nhad begun a letter to me in the French language: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son,\xe2\x80\x9d--he wrote to\r\nme,--\xe2\x80\x9cfear the love of women, fear that happiness, that poison....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nAfter his death my mother sent a very considerable sum of money to\r\nMoscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nFour years passed. I had but just left the university, and did not yet\r\nquite know what to do with myself, at what door to knock; in the\r\nmeanwhile, I was lounging about without occupation. One fine evening I\r\nencountered Maid\xc3\xa1noff in the theatre. He had contrived to marry and\r\nenter the government service; but I found him unchanged. He went into\r\nunnecessary raptures, just as of old, and became low-spirited as\r\nsuddenly as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said to me,--\xe2\x80\x9cby the way, that Madame D\xc3\xb3lsky is here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Madame D\xc3\xb3lsky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that you have forgotten? The former Princess Zasy\xc3\xa9kin,\r\nwith whom we were all in love, you included. At the villa, near\r\nNesk\xc3\xbatchny Park, you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she marry D\xc3\xb3lsky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is she here in the theatre?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, in Petersburg; she arrived here a few days ago; she is preparing to\r\ngo abroad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a man is her husband?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very fine young fellow and wealthy. He\xe2\x80\x99s my comrade in the service, a\r\nMoscow man. You understand--after that scandal ... you must be well\r\nacquainted with all that ...\xe2\x80\x9d (Maid\xc3\xa1noff smiled significantly), \xe2\x80\x9cit was\r\nnot easy for her to find a husband; there were consequences ... but with\r\nher brains everything is possible. Go to her; she will be delighted to\r\nsee you. She is handsomer than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMaid\xc3\xa1noff gave me Zina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s address. She was stopping in the Hotel\r\nDemuth. Old memories began to stir in me.... I promised myself that I\r\nwould call upon my former \xe2\x80\x9cpassion\xe2\x80\x9d the next day. But certain affairs\r\nturned up: a week elapsed, and when, at last, I betook myself to the\r\nHotel Demuth and inquired for Madame D\xc3\xb3lsky I learned that she had died\r\nfour days previously, almost suddenly, in childbirth.\r\n\r\nSomething seemed to deal me a blow in the heart. The thought that I\r\nmight have seen her but had not, and that I should never see her,--that\r\nbitter thought seized upon me with all the force of irresistible\r\nreproach. \xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, staring dully at the door-porter, then\r\nquietly made my way to the street and walked away, without knowing\r\nwhither. The whole past surged up at one blow and stood before me. And\r\nnow this was the way it had ended, this was the goal of that young,\r\nfiery, brilliant life? I thought that--I pictured to myself those dear\r\nfeatures, those eyes, those curls in the narrow box, in the damp,\r\nunderground gloom,--right there, not far from me, who was still alive,\r\nand, perchance, only a few paces from my father.... I thought all that,\r\nI strained my imagination, and yet--\r\n\r\n    From a mouth indifferent I heard the news of death,\r\n    And with indifference did I receive it--\r\n\r\nresounded through my soul. O youth, youth! Thou carest for nothing: thou\r\npossessest, as it were, all the treasures of the universe; even sorrow\r\ncomforts thee, even melancholy becomes thee; thou are self-confident and\r\naudacious; thou sayest: \xe2\x80\x9cI alone live--behold!\xe2\x80\x9d--But the days speed on\r\nand vanish without a trace and without reckoning, and everything\r\nvanishes in thee, like wax in the sun, like snow.... And perchance the\r\nwhole secret of thy charm consists not in the power to do everything,\r\nbut in the possibility of thinking that thou wilt do\r\neverything--consists precisely in the fact that thou scatterest to the\r\nwinds thy powers which thou hast not understood how to employ in any\r\nother way,--in the fact that each one of us seriously regards himself as\r\na prodigal, seriously assumes that he has a right to say: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what\r\ncould I not have done, had I not wasted my time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd I myself ... what did I hope for, what did I expect, what rich\r\nfuture did I foresee, when I barely accompanied with a single sigh, with\r\na single mournful emotion, the spectre of my first love which had arisen\r\nfor a brief moment?\r\n\r\nAnd what has come to pass of all for which I hoped? Even now, when the\r\nshades of evening are beginning to close in upon my life, what is there\r\nthat has remained for me fresher, more precious than the memory of that\r\nmorning spring thunder-storm which sped so swiftly past?\r\n\r\nBut I calumniate myself without cause. Even then, at that frivolous,\r\nyouthful epoch, I did not remain deaf to the sorrowful voice which\r\nresponded within me to the triumphant sound which was wafted to me from\r\nbeyond the grave. I remember that a few days after I learned of\r\nZina\xc3\xadda\xe2\x80\x99s death I was present, by my own irresistible longing, at the\r\ndeath-bed of a poor old woman who lived in the same house with us.\r\nCovered with rags, with a sack under her head, she died heavily and with\r\ndifficulty. Her whole life had been passed in a bitter struggle with\r\ndaily want; she had seen no joy, she had not tasted the honey of\r\nhappiness--it seemed as though she could not have failed to rejoice at\r\ndeath, at her release, her repose. But nevertheless, as long as her\r\ndecrepit body held out, as long as her breast heaved under the icy hand\r\nwhich was laid upon it, until her last strength deserted her, the old\r\nwoman kept crossing herself and whispering:--\xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, forgive my\r\nsins,\xe2\x80\x9d--and only with the last spark of consciousness did there vanish\r\nfrom her eyes the expression of fear and horror at her approaching end.\r\nAnd I remember that there, by the bedside of that poor old woman, I felt\r\nterrified for Zina\xc3\xadda, and felt like praying for her, for my father--and\r\nfor myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\n(1855)\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I was in Dresden. I stopped in the hotel. As I was\r\nrunning about the town from early morning until late at night, I did not\r\nconsider it necessary to make acquaintance with my neighbours; at last,\r\naccidentally, it came to my knowledge that there was a sick Russian in\r\nthe house. I went to him, and found a man in the last stage of\r\nconsumption. Dresden was beginning to pall upon me; I settled down with\r\nmy new acquaintance. It is wearisome to sit with an invalid, but even\r\nboredom is agreeable sometimes; moreover, my invalid was not dejected,\r\nand liked to chat. We endeavoured, in every way, to kill time: we played\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfool\xe2\x80\x9d together, we jeered at the doctor. My compatriot narrated to that\r\nvery bald German divers fictions about his own condition, which the\r\ndoctor always \xe2\x80\x9chad long foreseen\xe2\x80\x9d; he mimicked him when he was surprised\r\nat any unprecedented attack, flung his medicine out of the window and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I repeatedly remarked to my friend that it would not be a\r\nbad idea to send for a good physician before it was too late, that his\r\nmalady was not to be jested with, and so forth. But Alexy\xc3\xa9i (my\r\nacquaintance\xe2\x80\x99s name was Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch S***) put me off every time\r\nwith jests about all doctors in general, and his own in particular, and\r\nat last, one stormy autumn evening, to my importunate entreaties, he\r\nreplied with such a dejected glance, he shook his head so sadly, and\r\nsmiled so strangely, that I felt a certain surprise. That same night\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9i grew worse, and on the following day he died. Just before his\r\ndeath his customary cheerfulness deserted him: he tossed uneasily in the\r\nbed, sighed, gazed anxiously about ... grasped my hand, whispered with\r\nan effort: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis difficult to die, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d ... dropped his head on\r\nthe pillow, and burst into tears. I did not know what to say to him, and\r\nsat silently beside his bed. But Alexy\xc3\xa9i speedily conquered this last,\r\nbelated compassion.... \xe2\x80\x9cListen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me:--\xe2\x80\x9cour doctor will come\r\nto-day, and will find me dead.... I can imagine his phiz\xe2\x80\x9d ... and the\r\ndying man tried to mimic him.... He requested me to send all his things\r\nto Russia, to his relatives, with the exception of a small packet, which\r\nhe presented to me as a souvenir.\r\n\r\nThis packet contained letters--the letters of a young girl to Alexy\xc3\xa9i\r\nand his letters to her. There were fifteen of them in all. Alexy\xc3\xa9i\r\nPetr\xc3\xb3vitch S*** had known M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna B*** for a long time--from\r\nchildhood, apparently. Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch had a cousin, and M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nAlex\xc3\xa1ndrovna had a sister. In earlier years they had all lived together,\r\nthen they had dispersed, and had not met again for a long time; then\r\nthey had accidentally all assembled again in the country, in summer, and\r\nhad fallen in love--Alexy\xc3\xa9i\xe2\x80\x99s cousin with M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, and\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9i himself with the latter\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Summer passed and autumn came;\r\nthey parted. Alexy\xc3\xa9i being a sensible man, speedily became convinced\r\nthat he was not in the least beloved, and parted from his beauty very\r\nhappily; his cousin corresponded with M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna for a couple of\r\nyears longer ... but even he divined, at last, that he was deceiving\r\nboth her and himself in the most unconscionable manner, and he also fell\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nI should like to tell you a little about M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, dear\r\nreader, but you will learn to know her for yourself from her letters.\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9i wrote his first letter to her soon after her definitive breach\r\nwith his cousin. He was in Petersburg at the time, suddenly went abroad,\r\nfell ill in Dresden and died. I have decided to publish his\r\ncorrespondence with M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, and I hope for some indulgence\r\non the part of the reader, because these are not love-letters--God\r\nforbid! Love-letters are generally read by two persons only (but, on the\r\nother hand, a thousand times in succession), and are intolerable, if not\r\nridiculous, to a third person.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG, March 7, 1840.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR M\xc3\x81RYA ALEX\xc3\x81NDROVNA!\r\n\r\nI have never yet written to you a single time, I think, and here I am\r\nwriting now.... I have chosen a strange time, have I not? This is what\r\nhas prompted me to it: _Mon cousin Th\xc3\xa9odore_ has been to see me to-day,\r\nand--how shall I say it?... and has informed me, in the strictest\r\nprivacy (he never imparts anything in any other way), that he is in love\r\nwith the daughter of some gentleman here, and this time is bent on\r\nmarrying without fail, and that he has already taken the first step--he\r\nhas explained his intentions! As a matter of course, I hastened to\r\ncongratulate him on an event so pleasant for him; he has long stood in\r\nneed of an explanation ... but inwardly I was, I confess, somewhat\r\namazed. Although I knew that everything was over between you, yet it\r\nseemed to me.... In a word, I was amazed. I was preparing to go out\r\nvisiting to-day, but I have remained at home, and intend to have a\r\nlittle chat with you. If you do not care to listen to me, throw this\r\nletter into the fire immediately. I declare to you that I wish to be\r\nfrank, although I feel that you have a perfect right to take me for a\r\ndecidedly-intrusive man. Observe, however, that I would not have taken\r\npen in hand if I had not known that your sister is not with you:\r\nTh\xc3\xa9odore told me that she will be away all summer visiting your aunt,\r\nMadame B***. May God grant her all good things!\r\n\r\nSo, then, this is the way it has all turned out.... But I shall not\r\noffer you my friendship, and so forth; in general, I avoid solemn\r\nspeeches, and \xe2\x80\x9cintimate\xe2\x80\x9d effusions. In beginning to write this letter, I\r\nhave simply obeyed some momentary impulse: if any other feeling is\r\nhiding within me, let it remain hidden from sight for the present.\r\n\r\nNeither shall I attempt to console you. In consoling others, people\r\ngenerally desire to rid themselves, as speedily as possible, of the\r\nunpleasant feeling of involuntary, self-conceited compassion.... I\r\nunderstand sincere, warm sympathy ... but such sympathy is not to be got\r\nfrom every one.... Please be angry with me.... If you are angry, you\r\nwill probably read my epistle to the end.\r\n\r\nBut what right have I to write to you, to talk about my friendship, my\r\nfeelings, about consolation? None whatever--positively, none whatever;\r\nand I am bound to admit that, and I rely solely upon your kindness.\r\n\r\nDo you know what the beginning of my letter resembles? This: a certain\r\nMr. N. N. entered the drawing-room of a lady who was not in the least\r\nexpecting him,--who, perhaps, was expecting another man.... He divined\r\nthat he had come at the wrong time, but there was nothing to be done....\r\nHe sat down, and began to talk.... God knows what about: poetry, the\r\nbeauties of nature, the advantages of a good education ... in a word, he\r\ntalked the most frightful nonsense.... But in the meanwhile the first\r\nfive minutes had elapsed; he sat on; the lady resigned herself to her\r\nfate, and lo! Mr. N. N. recovered himself, sighed, and began to\r\nconverse--to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\nBut, despite all this idle chatter, I feel somewhat awkward,\r\nnevertheless. I seem to see before me your perplexed, even somewhat\r\nangry face: I feel conscious that it is almost impossible for you not to\r\nassume that I have some secret intentions or other, and therefore,\r\nhaving perpetrated a piece of folly, like a Roman I wrap myself in my\r\ntoga and await in silence your ultimate condemnation....\r\n\r\nBut, in particular: Will you permit me to continue to write to you?\r\n\r\nI remain sincerely and cordially your devoted servant--\r\n\r\nALEXY\xc3\x89I S***.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n_From M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna to Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch_\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF ... NO, March 22, 1840.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR!\r\n\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch!\r\n\r\nI have received your letter, and really, I do not know what to say to\r\nyou. I would even not have answered you at all had it not seemed to me\r\nthat beneath your jests was concealed a decidedly-friendly sentiment.\r\nYour letter has produced an unpleasant impression on me. In reply to\r\nyour \xe2\x80\x9cidle chatter,\xe2\x80\x9d as you put it, permit me also to propound to you\r\none question: To what end? What have you to do with me, what have I to\r\ndo with you? I do not assume any evil intentions on your part, ... on\r\nthe contrary, I am grateful to you for your sympathy, ... but we are\r\nstrangers to each other, and I now, at all events, feel not the\r\nslightest desire to become intimate with any one whomsoever.\r\n\r\nWith sincere respects I remain, and so forth,\r\n\r\nM\xc3\x81RYA B***.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG, March 30.\r\n\r\nI thank you, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, I thank you for your note, curt as it\r\nis. All this time I have been in a state of great agitation; twenty\r\ntimes a day I have thought of you and of my letter. You can imagine how\r\ncaustically I have laughed at myself; but now I am in a capital frame of\r\nmind, and am patting myself on the head. M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, I am\r\nentering into correspondence with you! Confess that you could not\r\npossibly have expected that after your reply; I am amazed at my own\r\naudacity ... never mind! But calm yourself: I want to talk to you not\r\nabout myself, but about you. Here, do you see: I find it imperatively\r\nnecessary--to speak in antiquated style--to express myself to some one.\r\nI have no right to select you for my confidante--I admit that; but\r\nhearken: I demand from you no reply to my epistles; I do not even wish\r\nto know whether you will peruse my \xe2\x80\x9cidle chatter,\xe2\x80\x9d but do not send me\r\nback my letters, in the name of all that is holy!\r\n\r\nListen--I am utterly alone on earth. In my youth I led a solitary life,\r\nalthough, I remember, I never pretended to be a Byron; but, in the\r\nfirst place, circumstances, in the second place, the ability to dream\r\nand a love for reverie, rather cold blood, pride, indolence--in a word,\r\na multitude of varied causes alienated me from the society of men. The\r\ntransition from a dreamy to an active life was effected in me late ...\r\nperhaps too late, perhaps to this day not completely. So long as my own\r\nthoughts and feelings diverted me, so long as I was capable of\r\nsurrendering myself to causeless silent raptures, and so forth, I did\r\nnot complain of my isolation. I had no comrades--I did have so-called\r\nfriends. Sometimes I needed their presence as an electrical machine\r\nneeds a discharger--that was all. Love ... we will be silent on that\r\nsubject for the present. But now, I confess, now loneliness weighs upon\r\nme, and yet I see no escape from my situation. I do not blame Fate; I\r\nalone am to blame, and I am justly chastised. In my youth one thing\r\nalone interested me: my charming ego; I took my good-natured self-love\r\nfor shyness; I shunned society, and lo! now I am frightfully bored with\r\nmyself. What is to become of me? I love no one; all my friendships with\r\nother people are, somehow, strained and false; and I have no memories,\r\nbecause in all my past life, I find nothing except my own self. Save me!\r\nI have not made you enthusiastic vows of love; I have not deafened you\r\nwith a torrent of chattering speeches; I have passed you by with\r\nconsiderable coldness, and precisely for that reason I have made up my\r\nmind now to have recourse to you. (I had thought of this even earlier,\r\nbut you were not free then....) Out of all my self-made joys and\r\nsufferings, the sole genuine feeling was the small, but involuntary\r\nattraction to you, which withered then, like a solitary ear of grain\r\namid worthless weeds.... Allow me, at least, to look into another face,\r\nanother soul,--my own face has grown repugnant to me; I am like a man\r\nwho has been condemned to live out his entire life in a room with walls\r\nmade of mirrors.... I do not demand any confessions from you--oh,\r\nheavens, no! Grant me the speechless sympathy of a sister, or at least\r\nthe simple curiosity of a reader--I will interest you, really, I will.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I have the honour to be your sincere friend,\r\n\r\nA. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nPETERSBURG, April 7th.\r\n\r\nI write again to you, although I foresee that, without your approval, I\r\nshall speedily hold my peace. I must admit that you cannot fail to feel\r\na certain distrust of me. What of that? Perhaps you are right. Formerly\r\nI would have declared to you (and, probably, would have believed my own\r\nwords) that, since we parted, I had \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloped,\xe2\x80\x9d had advanced; with\r\ncondescending, almost affectionate scorn I would have referred to my\r\npast; with touching boastfulness I would have initiated you into the\r\nsecrets of my present, active life ... but now, I assure you, M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nAlex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, I consider it shameful and disgusting to allude to the way\r\nin which my vile self-love once on a time fermented and amused itself.\r\nFear not: I shall not force upon you any great truths, any profound\r\nviews; I have none--none of those truths and views. I have become a nice\r\nfellow,--truly I have. I\xe2\x80\x99m bored, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna--so bored that I\r\ncan endure it no longer. That is why I am writing to you.... Really, it\r\nseems to me that we can come to an agreement....\r\n\r\nHowever, I positively am in no condition to talk to you until you\r\nstretch out your hand to me, until I receive from you a note with the\r\none word \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d--M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, will you hear me out?--that is the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nA. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n_From M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna to Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch_\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF ... NO, April 14.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange man you are! Well, then--\xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\x81RYA B***.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nPETERSBURG, May 2, 1840.\r\n\r\nHurrah! Thanks, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, thanks! You are a very kind and\r\nindulgent being.\r\n\r\nI begin, according to my promise, to speak of myself, and I shall speak\r\nwith pleasure, verging on appetite.... Precisely that. One may talk of\r\neverything in the world with fervour, with rapture, with enthusiasm, but\r\nonly of one\xe2\x80\x99s self can one talk with appetite.\r\n\r\nListen: an extremely strange incident happened to me the other day: I\r\ntook a glance at my past for the first time. You will understand me:\r\nevery one of us frequently recalls the past--with compunction or with\r\nvexation, or simply for the lack of something to do; but only at a\r\ncertain age can one cast a cold, clear glance at his whole past life--as\r\na traveller, turning round, gazes from a lofty mountain upon the plain\r\nwhich he has traversed ... and a secret chill grips the heart of a man\r\nwhen this happens to him for the first time. At any rate, my heart\r\ncontracted with pain. So long as we are young, that sort of looking\r\nbackward is impossible. But my youth is over--and, like the traveller on\r\nthe mountain, everything has become clearly visible to me....\r\n\r\nYes, my youth is gone, gone irrevocably!... Here it lies before me, all\r\nof it, as though in the palm of my hand....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x99Tis not a cheerful spectacle! I confess to you, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna,\r\nthat I am very sorry for myself. My God! My God! Is it possible that I\r\nmyself have ruined my own life to such a degree, have so ruthlessly\r\nentangled and tortured myself?... Now I have come to my senses, but it\r\nis too late. Have you ever rescued a fly from a spider? You have? Do you\r\nremember, you placed it in the sunshine; its wings, its legs were stuck\r\ntogether, glued fast.... How awkwardly it moved, how clumsily it tried\r\nto clean itself!... After long-continued efforts, it got itself to\r\nrights, after a fashion; it crawled, it tried to put its wings in order\r\n... but it could not walk as it formerly did; it could not buzz,\r\ncare-free, in the sunshine, now flying through an open window into a\r\ncool room, again fluttering freely out into the hot air.... It, at all\r\nevents, did not fall into the dreadful net of its own free will ... but\r\nI!\r\n\r\nI was my own spider.\r\n\r\nAnd, nevertheless, I cannot blame myself so very much. Yes, and\r\nwho--tell me, for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake--who ever was to blame for\r\nanything--alone? Or, to put it more accurately, we are all to blame, yet\r\nit is impossible to blame us. Circumstances settle our fate: they thrust\r\nus into this road or that, and then they punish us. Every man has his\r\nfate.... Wait, wait! There occurs to my mind on this score an\r\nartfully-constructed but just comparison. As clouds are first formed by\r\nthe exhalations from the earth, rise up from its bosom, then separate\r\nthemselves from it, withdraw from it, and bear over it either blessings\r\nor ruin, just so around each one of us and from us ourselves is\r\nformed--how shall I express it?--is formed a sort of atmosphere which\r\nafterward acts destructively or salutarily upon us ourselves. This I\r\ncall Fate.... In other words, and to put it simply: each person makes\r\nhis own fate, and it makes each person....\r\n\r\nEach person makes his own fate--yes!... but our brethren make it far too\r\nmuch--which constitutes our calamity! Consciousness is aroused in us too\r\nearly; too early do we begin to observe ourselves.... We Russians have\r\nno other life-problem than the cultivation of our personality, and here\r\nwe, barely adult children, already undertake to cultivate it, this our\r\nunhappy personality! Without having received from within any definite\r\ndirection, in reality respecting nothing, believing firmly in nothing,\r\nwe are free to make of ourselves whatsoever we will.... But it is\r\nimpossible to demand of every man that he shall immediately comprehend\r\nthe sterility of a mind, \xe2\x80\x9cseething in empty activity\xe2\x80\x9d ... and so, there\r\nis one more monster in the world, one more of those insignificant beings\r\nin which the habits of self-love distort the very striving after truth,\r\nand ridiculous ingenuousness lives side by side with pitiful guile ...\r\none of those beings to whose impotent, uneasy thought there remains\r\nforever unknown either the satisfaction of natural activity, or the\r\ngenuine suffering, or the genuine triumph of conviction.... Combining in\r\nitself the defects of all ages, we deprive each defect of its good, its\r\nredeeming side.... We are as stupid as children, but we are not sincere\r\nlike them; we are as cold as old men, but the common sense of old age is\r\nnot in us.... On the other hand, we are psychologists. Oh, yes, we are\r\ngreat psychologists! But our psychology strays off into pathology; our\r\npsychology is an artful study of the laws of a diseased condition and a\r\ndiseased development, with which healthy people have no concern.... But\r\nthe chief thing is, we are not young,--in youth itself we are not young!\r\n\r\nAnd yet--why calumniate one\xe2\x80\x99s self? Have we really never been young?\r\nHave the vital forces never sparkled, never seethed, never quivered in\r\nus? Yet we have been in Arcadia, and we have roved its bright meads!...\r\nHave you ever happened, while strolling among bushes, to hit upon those\r\ndark-hued harvest-flies, which, springing out from under your very feet,\r\nsuddenly expand their bright red wings with a clatter, flutter on a few\r\npaces, and then tumble into the grass again? Just so did our dark youth\r\nsometimes expand its gaily-coloured little wings for a few moments, and\r\na brief flight.... Do you remember our silent evening rambles, the four\r\nof us together, along the fence of your park, after some long, warm,\r\nanimated conversation? Do you remember those gracious moments? Nature\r\nreceived us affectionately and majestically into her lap. We entered,\r\nwith sinking heart, into some sort of blissful waves. Round about the\r\nglow of sunset kindled with sudden and tender crimson; from the\r\ncrimsoning sky, from the illuminated earth, from everywhere, it seemed\r\nas though the fresh and fiery breath of youth were wafted abroad, and\r\nthe joyous triumph of some immortal happiness; the sunset glow blazed;\r\nlike it, softly and passionately blazed our enraptured hearts, and the\r\ntiny leaves of the young trees quivered sensitively and confusedly above\r\nus, as though replying to the inward tremulousness of the indistinct\r\nfeelings and anticipations within us. Do you remember that purity, that\r\nkindness and trustfulness of ideas, that emotion of noble hopes, that\r\nsilence of plenitude? Can it be that we were not then worthy of\r\nsomething better than that to which life has conducted us? Why have we\r\nbeen fated only at rare intervals to catch sight of the longed-for\r\nshore, and never to stand thereon with firm foothold, never to touch\r\nit--\r\n\r\n    Not to weep sweetly, like the first of the Jews\r\n    On the borders of the Promised Land?\r\n\r\nThese two lines of Fet[10] have reminded me of others,--also by him....\r\nDo you remember how one day, as we were standing in the road, we beheld\r\nin the distance a cloud of rosy dust, raised by a light breeze, against\r\nthe setting sun? \xe2\x80\x9cIn a billowy cloud\xe2\x80\x9d you began, and we all fell silent\r\non the instant, and set to listening:\r\n\r\n    In a billowy cloud\r\n    The dust rises in the distance....\r\n    Whether horseman or pedestrian--\r\n    Cannot be descried for the dust.\r\n    I see some one galloping\r\n    On a spirited steed....\r\n    My friend, my distant friend--\r\n    Remember me!\r\n\r\nYou ceased.... All of us fairly shuddered, as though the breath of love\r\nhad flitted over our hearts, and each one of us--I am convinced of\r\nthat--longed inexpressibly to flee away in the distance, that unknown\r\ndistance, where the apparition of bliss rises up and beckons athwart the\r\nmist. And yet, observe this odd thing: why should we reach out into the\r\ndistance?--we thought. Were not we in love with each other? Was not\r\nhappiness \xe2\x80\x9cso near, so possible\xe2\x80\x9d? And I immediately asked you: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy have\r\nnot we gained the shore we long for?\xe2\x80\x9d Because falsehood was walking hand\r\nin hand with us; because it was poisoning our best sentiments; because\r\neverything in us was artificial and strained; because we did not love\r\neach other at all, and only tried to love, imagined that we did love....\r\n\r\nBut enough, enough! Why irritate one\xe2\x80\x99s wounds? Moreover, all that is\r\npast irrevocably. That which was good in our past has touched me, and on\r\nthis good I bid you farewell for the time being. And it is time to end\r\nthis long letter. I will go and inhale the May air here, in which,\r\nthrough the winter\xe2\x80\x99s stern fortress, the spring is forcing its way with\r\na sort of moist and keen warmth. Farewell.\r\n\r\nA. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n_From M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna to Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch_\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF ... NO, May 20, 1840.\r\n\r\nI have received your letter, Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch, and do you know what\r\nfeeling it aroused in me?--Indignation ... yes, indignation ... and I\r\nwill immediately explain to you why it aroused precisely that feeling in\r\nme. One thing is a pity: I am not a mistress of the pen--I rarely write.\r\nI do not know how to express my thoughts accurately and in a few words;\r\nbut you will, I hope, come to my aid. You yourself will try to\r\nunderstand me: if only for the sake of knowing why I am angry with you.\r\n\r\nTell me--you are a clever man--have you ever asked yourself what sort of\r\na creature a Russian woman is? What is her fate, her position in the\r\nworld--in short, what her life is like? I do not know whether you have\r\never had time to put that question to yourself; I cannot imagine how you\r\nwould answer it.... I might, in conversation be able to communicate to\r\nyou my ideas on that subject, but I shall hardly manage it on paper.\r\nHowever, it makes no difference. This is the point: you surely will\r\nagree with me that we women--at all events, those of us who are not\r\nsatisfied with the ordinary cares of domestic life--receive our final\r\neducation, all the same, from you--from the men: you have a great and\r\npowerful influence on us. Look, now, at what you do with us. I shall\r\nspeak of the young girls, especially of those who, like myself, dwell in\r\nthe dull places, and there are many such in Russia. Moreover, I do not\r\nknow others, and cannot judge with regard to them. Figure to yourself\r\nsuch a young girl. Here, now, her education is finished; she is\r\nbeginning to live, to amuse herself. But amusement alone is not enough\r\nfor her. She demands a great deal from life; she reads, dreams ... of\r\nlove:--\xe2\x80\x9cAlways of love alone!\xe2\x80\x9d you will say.... Let us assume that that\r\nword means a great deal to her. I will say again that I am not talking\r\nof the sort of girl who finds it burdensome and tiresome to think....\r\nShe looks about her, waits for the coming of him for whom her soul\r\npines.... At last he makes his appearance: she is carried away; she is\r\nlike soft wax in his hands. Everything--happiness, and love, and\r\nthought--everything has invaded her together with him, all at once; all\r\nher tremors are soothed, all her doubts are solved by him; truth itself\r\nseems to speak by his mouth; she worships him, she is ashamed of her\r\nhappiness, she learns, she loves. Great is his power over her at this\r\nperiod!... If he were a hero, he would kindle her to flame, he would\r\nteach her to sacrifice herself, and all sacrifices would be easy to\r\nher! But there are no heroes in our day.... Nevertheless, he guides her\r\nwhithersoever he will; she devotes herself to that which interests him,\r\nhis every word sinks into her soul: at that time, she does not know, as\r\nyet, how insignificant and empty and false that word may be, how little\r\nit costs him who utters it, and how little faith it merits! These first\r\nmoments of bliss and hope are followed, generally--according to\r\ncircumstances--(circumstances are always to blame)--are followed by\r\nparting. It is said that there have been cases where two kindred souls,\r\non recognising each other, have immediately united indissolubly; I have\r\nheard, also, that they are not always comfortable as a result.... But I\r\nwill not speak of that which I have not myself beheld--but that the very\r\npettiest sort of calculation, the most woful prudence, may dwell in a\r\nyoung heart side by side with the most passionate rapture,--that is a\r\nfact which, unhappily, I know by my own experience. So, then, parting\r\ncomes.... Happy is that young girl who instantly recognises that the end\r\nof all has come, who does not comfort herself with expectation! But you\r\nbrave, just men, in the majority of cases, have neither the courage nor\r\nthe desire to tell us the truth ... you find it more easy to deceive\r\nus.... I am ready to believe, however, that you deceive yourselves along\r\nwith us.... Parting! It is both difficult and easy to endure parting.\r\nIf only faith in him whom one loves were intact and unassailed, the soul\r\nwould conquer the pain of parting.... I will say more: only when she is\r\nleft alone does she learn the sweetness of solitude, not sterile but\r\nfilled with memories and thoughts. Only then will she learn to know\r\nherself--will she come to herself, will she grow strong.... In the\r\nletters of the distant friend she will find a support for herself; in\r\nher own she will, perhaps, for the first time, express her mind\r\nfully.... But as two persons who have started from the source of a river\r\nalong its different banks can, at first, clasp hands, then hold\r\ncommunication only with the voice, but ultimately lose sight of each\r\nother: so also two beings are ultimately disjoined by separation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nof that?\xe2\x80\x9d you will say: \xe2\x80\x9cevidently they were not fated to go\r\ntogether....\xe2\x80\x9d But here comes in the difference between a man and a\r\nwoman. It signifies nothing to a man to begin a new life, to shake far\r\nfrom him the past; a woman cannot do that. No, she cannot cast aside her\r\npast, she cannot tear herself away from her roots--no, a thousand times\r\nno! And so, a pitiful and ridiculous spectacle presents itself....\r\nGradually losing hope and faith in herself,--you can form no idea of how\r\npainful that is,--she will pine away and fade alone, obstinately\r\nclinging to her memories, and turning away from everything which life\r\naround her offers.... And he?... Seek him! Where is he? And is it worth\r\nwhile for him to pause? What time has he for looking back? All this is a\r\nthing of the past for him, you see.\r\n\r\nOr here is another thing which happens: it sometimes happens that he\r\nwill suddenly conceive a desire to meet the former object of his\r\naffections, he will even deliberately go to her.... But, my God! from\r\nwhat a motive of petty vain-glory he does it! In his polite compassion,\r\nin his counsels which are intended to be friendly, in his condescending\r\nexplanations of the past, there is audible such a consciousness of his\r\nown superiority! It is so agreeable and cheerful a thing for him to let\r\nhimself feel every minute how sensible and kind he is! And how little he\r\nunderstands what he is doing! How well he manages not even to guess at\r\nwhat is going on in the woman\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and how insultingly he pities\r\nher, if he does guess it!...\r\n\r\nTell me, please, whence are we to get the strength to endure all this?\r\nRemember this, too: in the majority of cases, a girl who, to her\r\nmisfortune, has an idea beginning to stir in her head, when she begins\r\nto love, and falls under the influence of a man, involuntarily separates\r\nherself from her family, from her acquaintances. Even previously she has\r\nnot been satisfied with their life, yet she has walked on by their side,\r\npreserving in her soul all her intimate secrets.... But the breach\r\nspeedily makes itself visible.... They cease to understand her, they are\r\nready to suspect every movement of hers.... At first she pays no heed\r\nto this, but afterward, afterward ... when she is left alone, when that\r\ntoward which she has been striving and for which she has sacrificed\r\neverything escapes her grasp, when she has not attained to heaven, but\r\nwhen every near thing, every possible thing, has retreated far from\r\nher--what shall uphold her? Sneers, hints, the vulgar triumph of coarse\r\ncommon sense she can still bear, after a fashion ... but what is she to\r\ndo, to what is she to have recourse, when the inward voice begins to\r\nwhisper to her that all those people were right, and that she has been\r\nmistaken; that life, of whatever sort it may be, is better than dreams,\r\nas health is better than disease ... when her favourite occupations, her\r\nfavourite books, disgust her, the books from which one cannot extract\r\nhappiness,--what, say you,--what shall uphold her? How is she to help\r\nsuccumbing in such a struggle? How is she to live and to go on living in\r\nsuch a wilderness? Confess herself vanquished, and extend her hand like\r\na beggar to indifferent people? Will not they give her at least some of\r\nthat happiness with which the proud heart once imagined that it could\r\ndispense--all that is nothing as yet! But to feel one\xe2\x80\x99s self ridiculous\r\nat the very moment when one is shedding bitter, bitter tears ... akh!\r\nGod forbid that you should go through that experience!...\r\n\r\nMy hands are trembling, and I am in a fever all over.... My face is\r\nburning hot. It is time for me to stop.... I shall send off this letter\r\nas speedily as possible, while I am not ashamed of my weakness. But, for\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s sake, not a word in your reply--do you hear me?--not a word of\r\npity, or I will never write to you again. Understand me: I should not\r\nlike to have you take this letter as the outpouring of a misunderstood\r\nsoul which is making complaint.... Akh! it is all a matter of\r\nindifference to me! Farewell.\r\n\r\nM.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG, May 28, 1840.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, you are a fine creature ... indeed you are ... your\r\nletter has disclosed to me the truth at last! O Lord my God! what\r\ntorture! A man is constantly thinking that now he has attained\r\nsimplicity, no longer shows off, puts on airs, or lies ... but when you\r\ncome to look at him more attentively, he has become almost worse than he\r\nwas before. And this must be noted: the man himself, alone that is to\r\nsay, will never attain to that consciousness, bestir himself as he may!\r\nhis eye will not discern his own defects, just as the blunted eye of\r\nthe printer will not detect errors: another, a fresher eye is required.\r\nI thank you, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna.... You see, I am speaking to you of\r\nmyself; I dare not speak of you.... Akh, how ridiculous my last letter\r\nseems to me now,--so eloquent and sentimental! Go on, I beg of you, with\r\nyour confession; I have a premonition that you will be relieved thereby,\r\nand it will be of great benefit to me. Not without cause does the\r\nproverb say: \xe2\x80\x9cA woman\xe2\x80\x99s wit is better than many thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d; and a woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheart is far more so--God is my witness that it is so! If women only\r\nknew how much better, and more magnanimous, and clever--precisely\r\nthat--clever they are than the men, they would grow puffed up with\r\npride, and get spoiled: but, fortunately, they do not know that; they do\r\nnot know it because their thoughts have not become accustomed to\r\nreturning incessantly to themselves, as have the thoughts of us men.\r\nThey think little about themselves--that is their weakness and their\r\nstrength; therein lies the whole secret--I will not say of our\r\nsuperiority, but of our power. They squander their souls, as a lavish\r\nheir squanders his father\xe2\x80\x99s gold, but we collect interest from every\r\nlook.... How can they enter into rivalry with us?... All this is not\r\ncompliments, but the simple truth, demonstrated by experience. Again I\r\nentreat you, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, to continue writing to me.... If you\r\nonly knew all that comes into my mind!... But now I do not want to talk,\r\nI want to listen to you.... My speech will come later on. Write, write.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nA. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n_From M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna to Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch_\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF ... NO, June 12, 1840.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I despatched my last letter to you, Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch,\r\nthan I repented of it; but there was no help for it. One thing somewhat\r\nsoothed me: I am convinced that you have understood under the influence\r\nof what long-suppressed feelings it was written, and have forgiven me. I\r\ndid not even read over at the time what I had written to you; I remember\r\nthat my heart was beating so violently that my pen trembled in my hand.\r\nHowever, although I probably should have expressed myself differently if\r\nI had given myself time to think it over, still I have no intention of\r\ndisclaiming either my words or the feelings which I have imparted to you\r\nto the best of my ability. To-day I am much more cool-headed, and have\r\nfar better control over myself....\r\n\r\nI remember that I spoke toward the end of my letter about the painful\r\nsituation of the young girl who recognises the fact that she is isolated\r\neven among her own people.... I will not enlarge further on that point,\r\nbut rather will I communicate to you a few details; it seems to me that\r\nI shall bore you less in that way.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, you must know that throughout the whole country-side\r\nI am not called anything but \xe2\x80\x9cthe female philosopher\xe2\x80\x9d; the ladies, in\r\nparticular, allude to me by that name. Some assert that I sleep with a\r\nLatin book in my hands and in spectacles; others, that I know how to\r\nextract some cubic roots or other: not one of them cherishes any doubt\r\nthat I wear masculine attire on the sly, and that instead of \xe2\x80\x9cgood\r\nmorning,\xe2\x80\x9d I say abruptly: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorges Sand!\xe2\x80\x9d--and indignation against \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nfemale philosopher\xe2\x80\x9d is on the increase. We have a neighbour, a man of\r\nfive-and-forty, a great wit, ... at least, he has the reputation of\r\nbeing a great wit, ... and for him my poor person is an inexhaustible\r\nsubject for jeers. He has related, concerning me, that as soon as the\r\nmoon rises in the sky, I cannot take my eyes from it, and he shows how I\r\nlook; that I even drink coffee not with cream but with the moon, that is\r\nto say, I set my cup in its rays. He swears that I use phrases in the\r\nnature of the following: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is easy because it is difficult;\r\nalthough, on the other hand, it is difficult because it is easy.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\nHe declares that I am always seeking some word or other, always yearning\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthither,\xe2\x80\x9d and he inquires, with comic indignation: \xe2\x80\x9cWhither is thither?\r\nWhither?\xe2\x80\x9d He has also set in circulation about me a rumour to the effect\r\nthat I ride by night on horseback back and forth through the ford of the\r\nriver, singing the while Schubert\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSerenade,\xe2\x80\x9d or simply moaning:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeethoven, Beethoven!\xe2\x80\x9d as much as to say--\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s such a fiery old\r\nwoman!\xe2\x80\x9d and so forth, and so forth. Of course, all this immediately\r\nreaches my ears. Perhaps this may surprise you; but do not forget that\r\nfour years have elapsed since you have sojourned in these parts.\r\nRemember how every one gazed askance at us then.... Now their turn has\r\ncome. And all this is nothing. I sometimes happen to hear words which\r\npierce my heart much more painfully. I will not mention the fact that my\r\npoor, good mother cannot possibly pardon me for your cousin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nindifference; but all my life runs through the fire, as my old nurse\r\nexpresses it. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d--I hear constantly,--\xe2\x80\x9chow are we to keep up\r\nwith thee? We are plain folks, we are guided only by common sense; but,\r\nafter all, when one comes to think of it, to what have all these\r\nphilosophisings and books and acquaintances with learned people brought\r\nthee?\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps you remember my sister--not the one to whom you were\r\nformerly not indifferent, but the other, the elder, who is married. Her\r\nhusband, you will remember, is a decidedly-ridiculous man; you often\r\nused to make fun of him in those days. Yet she is happy: the mother of a\r\nfamily, she loves her husband, and her husband adores her.... \xe2\x80\x9cI am like\r\nall the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d--she says to me sometimes;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut how about thee?\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\nis right: I envy her....\r\n\r\nAnd nevertheless I feel that I should not like to change places with\r\nher. Let them call me \xe2\x80\x9ca female philosopher,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9can eccentric,\xe2\x80\x9d whatever\r\nthey choose--I shall remain faithful to the end ... to what?--to an\r\nideal, pray? Yes, to an ideal. Yes, I shall remain faithful to the end\r\nto that which first made my heart beat,--to that which I have\r\nacknowledged and do acknowledge to be the true, the good. If only my\r\nstrength does not fail me, if only my idol does not prove a soulless\r\nblock....\r\n\r\nIf you really do feel friendship for me, if you really have not\r\nforgotten me, you must help me; you must disperse my doubts, strengthen\r\nmy beliefs....\r\n\r\nBut what aid can you render me? \xe2\x80\x9cAll this is nonsense, like the useless\r\nrunning of a squirrel on a wheel,\xe2\x80\x9d said my uncle to me yesterday--I\r\nthink you do not know him--a retired naval officer, and a far from\r\nstupid man. \xe2\x80\x9cA husband, children, a pot of buckwheat groats: to tend\r\nhusband and children, and look after the pot of groats--that\xe2\x80\x99s what a\r\nwoman needs.\xe2\x80\x9d... Tell me, he is right, is he not?\r\n\r\nIf he really is right, I can still repair the past, I can still get into\r\nthe common rut. What else is there for me to wait for? What is there to\r\nhope for? In one of your letters, you spoke of the wings of youth. How\r\noften, how long they remain fettered! And then comes a time, when they\r\nfall off; and it is no longer possible to raise one\xe2\x80\x99s self above the\r\nearth, to soar heavenward. Write to me.\r\n\r\nYours, M.\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG, June 16, 1840.\r\n\r\nI hasten to answer your letter, my dear M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna. I will\r\nconfess to you that if it were not for.... I will not say business--I\r\nhave none--if it were not for my being so stupidly habituated to this\r\nplace, I would go again to you and would talk my fill, but on paper all\r\nthis comes out so coldly, in such a dead manner....\r\n\r\nI repeat to you, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna: women are better than men, and you\r\nought to demonstrate that in deed. Let us men fling aside our\r\nconvictions, like a worn-out garment, or barter them for a morsel of\r\nbread, or, in conclusion, let them fall into the sleep which knows no\r\nwaking, and place over them, as over one formerly beloved, a tombstone,\r\nto which one goes only now and then to pray--let us men do all that; but\r\ndo not you women be false to yourselves, do not betray your ideal....\r\nThat word has become ridiculous.... To be afraid of the ridiculous is\r\nnot to love the truth. It does happen, it is true, that a stupid laugh\r\nwill make the stupid man, even good people, renounce a great deal ...\r\ntake for example the defence of an absent friend.... I am guilty in that\r\nrespect myself. But, I repeat it, you women are better than we are....\r\nIn trifles you are inclined to yield to us; but you understand better\r\nthan we do how to look the devil straight in the eye. I shall give you\r\nneither aid nor advice--how can I? and you do not need it; but I do\r\nstretch forth my hand to you, and I do say to you: \xe2\x80\x9cHave patience; fight\r\nuntil the end; and know that, as a feeling, the consciousness of a\r\nbattle honourably waged almost transcends the triumph of victory.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\nThe victory does not depend upon us.\r\n\r\nOf course, from a certain point of view, your uncle is right: family\r\nlife is everything for a woman; there is no other life for her.\r\n\r\nBut what does that prove? Only the Jesuits assert that every means is\r\ngood, if only one attains his end. It is not true! not true! It is an\r\nindignity to enter a clean temple with feet soiled with the mire of the\r\nroad. At the end of your letter there is a phrase which I do not like:\r\nyou want to get into the common rut. Look out--do not make a misstep! Do\r\nnot forget, moreover, that it is impossible to efface the past; and\r\nstrive as you may, force yourself as you will, you cannot make yourself\r\nyour sister. You have ascended above her. But your soul is broken, hers\r\nis intact. You can lower yourself, bend down to her, but nature will not\r\nresign her rights, and the broken place will not grow together again....\r\n\r\nYou are afraid--let us speak without circumlocution--you are afraid of\r\nremaining an old maid. I know that you are already twenty-six years old.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the position of old maids is not enviable: every\r\none so gladly laughs at them; every one notes their oddities and their\r\nweaknesses with such unmagnanimous delight. But if you scan more closely\r\nany elderly bachelor,--he deserves to have the finger of scorn pointed\r\nat him also,--you will find in him cause to laugh your fill. What is to\r\nbe done? Happiness is not to be captured by battle. But we must not\r\nforget that not happiness but human dignity is the chief goal of life.\r\n\r\nYou describe your position with great humour. I well understand all its\r\nbitterness; your position may, I am sure, be called tragic. But you\r\nmust know that you are not the only one who finds herself in it: there\r\nis hardly any man of the present day who does not find himself in it\r\nalso. You will say that that does not make it any the easier for you;\r\nbut what I think is that to suffer in company with thousands is quite a\r\ndifferent thing from suffering alone. It is not a question of egotism\r\nhere, but of a feeling of universal necessity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll this is very fine, let us assume,\xe2\x80\x9d you will say, ... \xe2\x80\x9cbut, in point\r\nof fact, it is not applicable to the case.\xe2\x80\x9d Why is it not applicable? Up\r\nto the present day I think, and I hope that I shall never cease to\r\nthink, that in God\xe2\x80\x99s world everything honest, good, and true is\r\napplicable, and sooner or later will be fulfilled; and not only will be\r\nfulfilled, but is already being fulfilled, if each one will only hold\r\nhimself firmly in his place, will not lose patience, will not desire the\r\nimpossible, but will act, so far as his strength permits. But I think I\r\nhave given myself up too much to abstractions. I will defer the\r\ncontinuation of my arguments until another letter; but I do not wish to\r\nlay down my pen without having pressed your hand warmly, very warmly,\r\nand wished you, with all my soul, everything that is good on earth.\r\n\r\nYours, A. S.\r\n\r\nP.S. By the way, you say that you have nothing to look forward to,\r\nnothing to hope for; how do you know that, allow me to ask?\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n_From M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna to Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch_\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF ... NO, June 30, 1840.\r\n\r\nHow grateful I am to you for your letter, Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch! How much\r\ngood it has done me! I see that you really are a good and trustworthy\r\nman, and therefore I shall not dissimulate before you. I trust you. I\r\nknow that you will not make a bad use of my frankness and that you will\r\ngive me friendly advice. That is the point.\r\n\r\nYou noticed at the end of my letter a phrase which did not entirely\r\nplease you. This is what it referred to. There is a neighbour here ...\r\nhe was not here in your day, and you have not seen him. He ... I might\r\nmarry him, if I wished; he is a man who is still young, cultured,\r\nwealthy. There are no obstacles on the side of my relatives; on the\r\ncontrary, they--I know this for certain--desire this marriage; he is a\r\nfine man, and I think he loves me.... But he is so languid and petty,\r\nall his desires are so narrow, that I cannot help recognising my\r\nsuperiority over him; he feels this, and seems to take delight in it,\r\nand precisely that repels me from him; I cannot respect him, although he\r\nhas an excellent heart. What am I to do, tell me? Think for me and\r\nwrite me your opinion sincerely.\r\n\r\nBut how grateful I am to you for your letter!... Do you know, I have\r\nsometimes been visited by such bitter thoughts.... Do you know, I have\r\ngone so far as almost to feel ashamed of every--I will not say\r\nexalted--but of every trustful feeling. I have shut my book in vexation\r\nwhen it spoke of hope and happiness; I have turned away from the\r\ncloudless sky, from the fresh verdure of the trees, from everything that\r\nsmiled and was glad. What a painful condition this was! I say \xe2\x80\x9cwas\xe2\x80\x9d ...\r\nas though it had passed!\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it has passed; I know that if it does not return I\r\nshall be indebted to you for it. You see, Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch, how much\r\ngood you have done, perhaps without yourself suspecting it! Now, in the\r\nvery heart of summer, the days are magnificent, the sky is blue,\r\nbright.... It cannot be more beautiful in Italy. But you are sitting in\r\na stifling and dusty town, you are walking on the scorching pavements.\r\nWhat possesses you to do it? You ought, at least, to remove to a villa\r\nsomewhere. They say that beyond Peterhoff, on the seashore, there are\r\ncharming places.\r\n\r\nI should like to write more to you, but it is impossible: such a sweet\r\nperfume has been wafted up to me from the garden that I cannot remain\r\nin the house. I shall put on my hat and go for a stroll.... Farewell\r\nuntil another time, kind Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nM. B.\r\n\r\nP.S. I have forgotten to tell you ... just imagine: that wit, of whom I\r\nrecently wrote you,--just imagine: he has made me a declaration of love,\r\nand in the most fiery terms! At first I thought that he was making fun\r\nof me; but he wound up with a formal proposal. What do you think of\r\nthat, after all his calumnies? But he is positively too old. Last night,\r\nto pique him, I sat down at the piano in front of the open window in the\r\nmoonlight, and played Beethoven. It was so delightful to me to feel its\r\ncold light on my face, so consolatory to send forth upon the perfumed\r\nnight air the noble sounds of music, athwart which, at times, the song\r\nof the nightingale was audible! It is a long time since I have been so\r\nhappy, but do you write to me concerning the thing I asked you about in\r\nthe beginning of my letter: it is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vich to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nST. PETERSBURG, July 8, 1840.\r\n\r\nMy dear M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, here is my opinion in two words: throw both\r\nthe old bachelor and the young suitor overboard! There\xe2\x80\x99s no use in\r\ndeliberating over this. Neither of them is worthy of you--that is as\r\nclear as that twice two are four. The young neighbour may be a good man,\r\nbut I throw him over! I am convinced that you and he have nothing in\r\ncommon, and you can imagine how cheerful it would be to live together!\r\nAnd why be in a hurry? Is it possible that a woman like you--I have no\r\nintention of paying compliments, and therefore will not enlarge\r\nfurther--that such a woman as you should not meet some one who will know\r\nhow to appreciate her? No, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna; heed me if you really\r\nthink that my advice is beneficial.\r\n\r\nBut confess that you found it pleasant to behold that old calumniator at\r\nyour feet!... If I had been in your place, I would have made him sing\r\nBeethoven\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAdela\xc3\xafda\xe2\x80\x9d the whole night through, staring at the moon the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nBut God be with them, with your admirers! It is not of them that I wish\r\nto talk with you to-day. I am in a sort of half-irritated,\r\nhalf-agitated condition to-day, as the result of a letter which I\r\nreceived yesterday. I send you a copy of it. This letter was written by\r\none of my very old friends and comrades in the service, a kind-hearted\r\nbut rather narrow-minded man. A couple of years ago he went abroad, and\r\nup to the present he has not written to me a single time. Here is his\r\nletter. N.B. He is very far from bad-looking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Cher Alexis_:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am in Naples. I am sitting in my chamber on the Chiaja at the window.\r\nThe weather is wonderful. At first I gazed a long time at the sea, then\r\nimpatience seized upon me, and the brilliant idea of writing a letter to\r\nthee occurred to me. I have always felt an affection for thee, my dear\r\nfriend,--Heaven is my witness that I have! And now I should like to pour\r\nmyself into thy bosom.... I believe that is the way it is expressed in\r\nour elevated language. And the reason I have been seized with impatience\r\nis that I am expecting a woman; together we shall go to Bai\xc3\xa6 to eat\r\noysters and oranges, to watch the dark-brown shepherds in red nightcaps\r\ndance the tarantella, to broil ourselves in the sunshine, to watch the\r\nlizards--in a word, to enjoy life to the full. My dear friend, I am so\r\nhappy that I am unable to express it to you. If I possessed thy power\r\nwith the pen, oh, what a picture I would draw before thine eyes! But,\r\nunfortunately, as thou knowest, I am an illiterate man. The woman for\r\nwhom I am waiting, and who has already made me constantly start and\r\nglance at the door, loves me--and as for the way I love her, it seems to\r\nme that even thou with thy eloquent pen couldst not describe that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell thee that I have known her for the last three months, and\r\never since the very first day of our acquaintance, my love has gone on\r\n_crescendo_, in the shape of a chromatic scale, ever higher and higher,\r\nand at the present moment it has already attained to the seventh heaven.\r\nI am jesting, but, as a matter of fact, my attachment to that woman is\r\nsomething extraordinary, supernatural. Just imagine: I hardly ever talk\r\nwith her, but I stare at her incessantly and laugh. I sit at her feet, I\r\nfeel that I am frightfully stupid and happy, simply unlawfully happy. It\r\nsometimes happens that she lays her hand on my head.... And then, I must\r\ntell thee, ... but thou canst not understand it; for thou art a\r\nphilosopher, and have been a philosopher all thy life. Her name is Nina,\r\nNinetta--as thou wilt; she is the daughter of a wealthy merchant here.\r\nBeautiful as all thy Raphaels; lively as powder, blithe, so clever that\r\nit is positively amazing that she should have fallen in love with such a\r\nfool as myself; she sings like a bird, and her eyes--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, pray, for this involuntary tirade.... I thought the door\r\ncreaked.... No, the rogue has not come yet! Thou wilt ask me how all\r\nthis is going to end, and what I mean to do with myself, and whether I\r\nshall remain here long. I know nothing, and wish to know nothing, about\r\nthat, my dear fellow. What is to be will be.... For if one is to pause\r\nand reason constantly....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis she!... She is running up the stairs and singing.... She has\r\ncome.... Well, good-by, my dear fellow.... I\xe2\x80\x99m in no mood for thee.\r\nPardon me--it is she who has spattered this letter all over: she struck\r\nthe paper with her damp nosegay. At first she thought I was writing to a\r\nwoman; but as soon as she found out that it was to a man-friend, she\r\nbade me give you her compliments, and inquire whether there are any\r\nflowers in your country, and whether they are fragrant. Well,\r\ngood-by.... If you could only hear how she laughs!... Silver rings just\r\nlike that: and what goodness in every sound!--One fairly wants to kiss\r\nher feet. Let us go, let us go! Be not angry at this untidy scrawl, and\r\nenvy thy--\r\n\r\nM...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe letter actually was bespattered, and exhaled an odour of\r\norange-flowers ... two white petals had adhered to the paper. This\r\nletter has excited me.... I have called to mind my sojourn in\r\nNaples.... The weather was magnificent then also; May was only just\r\nbeginning; I had recently completed my twenty-second year; but I did not\r\nknow any Ninetta. I roamed about alone, consumed with a thirst for\r\nbliss, which was both painful and sweet,--sweet to the point where it\r\nitself bore a sort of resemblance to bliss.... What a thing it is to be\r\nyoung!... I remember I once went out for a row on the bay at night.\r\nThere were two of us: the boatman and I ... but what was it you thought?\r\nWhat a night it was, and what a sky, what stars--how they trembled and\r\ncrumbled in the waves! With what a liquid flame did the water flow over\r\nand flash up under the oars, what perfume was wafted all over the\r\nsea--it is not for me to describe, however \xe2\x80\x9celoquent\xe2\x80\x9d my pen may be. A\r\nFrench ship of the line lay at anchor in the roadstead. It glowed\r\nobscurely red all over with lights; long streaks of red light, the\r\nreflection of the illuminated windows, stretched across the dark sea.\r\nMerry music reached me in occasional bursts; I recall, in particular,\r\nthe trill of a small flute amid the dull blaring of the horns; it seemed\r\nto flutter like a butterfly around my boat. I ordered the man to row to\r\nthe ship; twice did we make the circuit of it. Women\xe2\x80\x99s forms flitted\r\npast the windows, borne smartly past on the whirlwind of the waltz.... I\r\nordered the boatman to put off, far away, straight out into the\r\ndarkness.... I remember that the sounds pursued me long and\r\nimportunately.... At last they died away. I stood up in the boat and\r\nstretched out my arms over the sea in the dumb pain of longing.... Oh,\r\nhow my heart ached then! How oppressive was my loneliness! With what joy\r\nwould I have given myself at that moment wholly, wholly ... wholly, if\r\nonly there had been any one to whom to give myself! With what a bitter\r\nfeeling in my soul did I fling myself, face down, in the bottom of the\r\nboat and, like Repet\xc3\xadloff, request him to take me somewhere or other!\r\n\r\nBut my friend here experienced nothing of that sort. And why should he?\r\nHe has managed matters much more cleverly than I did. He is living ...\r\nwhile I ... not without cause has he called me a philosopher.... \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nstrange! You, also, are called a philosopher.... Why should such a\r\ncalamity overtake us?...\r\n\r\nI am not living.... But who is to blame for that? Why do I sit here in\r\nPetersburg? What am I doing here? Why do I kill day after day? Why don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI go to the country? Are not our steppes beautiful? Or cannot one\r\nbreathe freely in them? Or is it stifling in them? What possesses me to\r\npursue dreams, when, perchance, happiness is within my reach? It is\r\nsettled: I am going away, I am going away to-morrow, if possible; I am\r\ngoing home, that is, to you--it is all the same: for we live only\r\ntwenty versts apart. What\xe2\x80\x99s the use, after all, in languishing here? And\r\nwhy is it that this idea did not occur to me earlier? My dear M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nAlex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, we shall soon meet. But it is remarkable that this thought\r\ndid not enter my head until this moment! I ought to have gone away long,\r\nlong ago. Farewell until we meet, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna.\r\n\r\nJuly 9th.\r\n\r\nI have deliberately given myself twenty-four hours to think it over, and\r\nnow I am definitively convinced that there is no reason why I should\r\nremain here. The dust in the streets is so biting that it makes one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\neyes ache. To-day I shall begin to pack; on the day after to-morrow,\r\nprobably, I shall leave here; and ten days hence I shall have the\r\npleasure of seeing you. I hope you will receive me as of old. By the\r\nway--your sister is still visiting your aunt, is she not?\r\n\r\nPermit me, M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, to press your hand warmly, and to say to\r\nyou from my soul: farewell until a speedy meeting. I was preparing to\r\nleave in any case, but this letter has precipitated my intention. Let us\r\nassume that this letter proves nothing; let us even assume that Ninetta\r\nwould not please any one else--me, for example. Yet I am going, all the\r\nsame; there is no doubt about that. Farewell for the present.\r\n\r\nYours, A. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n_From M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna to Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch_\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF ... NO, July 16, 1840.\r\n\r\nYou are coming hither, you will soon be with us, will you not, Alexy\xc3\xa9i\r\nPetr\xc3\xb3vitch? I will not conceal from you that this news both delights and\r\nagitates me.... How shall we meet? Will that spiritual bond be preserved\r\nwhich, so it seems to me, has already begun to unite us? Will it not\r\nbreak when we meet? I do not know; I am apprehensive, for some reason or\r\nother. I will not answer your last letter, although I might say a good\r\ndeal; I will defer all this until we meet. My mother is greatly\r\ndelighted at your coming.... She has been aware that I was corresponding\r\nwith you. The weather is enchanting. We will walk a great deal; I will\r\nshow you the new places which I have discovered ... one long, narrow\r\nvalley is particularly nice: it lies between hillocks, covered with\r\nforest.... It seems to be hiding in their curves. A tiny brook blows\r\nalong it and can barely force its way through the grass and flowers....\r\nYou shall see. Come: perhaps you will not find it tedious.\r\n\r\nM. B.\r\n\r\nP.S. You will not see my sister, I think: she is still visiting my aunt.\r\nI believe (this is between ourselves) that she is going to marry a very\r\namiable young man--an officer. Why did you send me that letter from\r\nNaples? The life here perforce seems dim and pale in comparison with\r\nthat luxury and that brilliancy. But Mademoiselle Ninetta is wrong:\r\nflowers grow and are fragrant--even with us.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n_From M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna to Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch_\r\n\r\nVILLAGE OF ... NO, January, 1841.\r\n\r\nI have written to you several times, Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch.... You have not\r\nanswered me. Are you alive? Or perhaps our correspondence has begun to\r\nbore you; perhaps you have found for yourself a more agreeable diversion\r\nthan the letters of a rustic young lady can afford you? Evidently you\r\ncalled me to mind for the lack of something to do. If that is the case,\r\nI wish you happiness. If you do not answer me this time, I shall not\r\ntrouble you again; there will be nothing left for me to do but to regret\r\nmy imprudence, that I have unnecessarily permitted myself to be roused\r\nup, have offered my hand and emerged, if only for a moment, from my\r\nisolated nook. I ought to remain in it forever, lock myself in--that is\r\nmy portion, the portion of all old maids. I ought to accustom myself to\r\nthat thought. There is no necessity for coming out into God\xe2\x80\x99s sunlight,\r\nno necessity for craving fresh air, when the lungs will not bear it. By\r\nthe way, we are now blocked up with dead drifts of snow. I shall be more\r\nsensible henceforth.... People do not die of boredom, but it is possible\r\nto perish with melancholy, I suppose. If I am mistaken, prove it to me.\r\nBut I think I am not mistaken. In any case, farewell. I wish you\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nM. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n_From Alexy\xc3\xa9i Petr\xc3\xb3vitch to M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna_\r\n\r\nDRESDEN, September, 1842.\r\n\r\nI write to you, my dear M\xc3\xa1rya Alex\xc3\xa1ndrovna, and I write only because I\r\ndo not wish to die without having taken leave of you, and without having\r\nrecalled myself to your mind. I am condemned by the doctors ... and I\r\nmyself feel that my life is drawing to a close. On my table stands a\r\nrose; before it fades I shall be no more. But that comparison is not\r\nquite just. The rose is far more interesting than I am.\r\n\r\nAs you see, I am abroad. I have been in Dresden six months. I received\r\nyour last letters--I am ashamed to confess: I lost several of them more\r\nthan a year ago, and did not answer you.... I will tell you presently\r\nwhy. But, evidently, you have always been dear to me: with the exception\r\nof yourself, there is no one of whom I wish to take leave, and perhaps I\r\nhave no one to whom I could bid farewell.\r\n\r\nSoon after my last letter to you (I was quite ready to set out for your\r\nparts, and was making various plans in advance), there happened to me an\r\nepisode which had, I may say, a strong influence on my fate,--so strong\r\nthat here I am, dying, thanks to that event. To wit: I set out for the\r\ntheatre, to see the ballet. I have never liked the ballet, and have\r\nalways felt a secret disgust for all sorts of actresses, singers, and\r\ndancers.... But, obviously, one cannot change his fate, neither does any\r\none know himself, and it is also impossible to foresee the future. In\r\npoint of fact, nothing happens in life except the unexpected, and we do\r\nnothing all our life long but adjust ourselves to events.... But I\r\nbelieve I am dropping into philosophy again. Old habit!... In a word, I\r\nfell in love with a dancer.\r\n\r\nThis was all the more strange because she could not be called a beauty.\r\nShe had, it is true, wonderful golden hair, with an ash tinge, and\r\nlarge, bright eyes, with a pensive and, at the same time, a bold\r\nglance.... Haven\xe2\x80\x99t I cause to know the expression of that glance? I\r\npined and languished for a whole year in its rays! She had a splendid\r\nfigure, and when she danced her folkdance, the spectators used to stamp\r\nand shout with rapture.... But I do not think any one besides myself\r\nfell in love with her--at all events, no one fell in love with her as I\r\ndid. From the very minute that I beheld her for the first time--(will\r\nyou believe it? all I have to do even now is to shut my eyes, and\r\nimmediately here stands before me the theatre, the almost empty stage,\r\nrepresenting the interior of a forest, and she runs out from behind the\r\nside-scenes on the right, with a wreath of vine-leaves on her head and a\r\ntiger-skin over her shoulders)--from that fatal minute I belonged to her\r\nwholly,--just as a dog belongs to his master; and if now, when I am\r\ndying, I do not belong to her, it is merely because she has cast me off.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, she never troubled herself especially about me. She\r\nbarely noticed me, although she good-naturedly made use of my money. I\r\nwas for her, as she expressed it in her broken French jargon, \xe2\x80\x9c_oun\r\nRousso buon enfan_,\xe2\x80\x9d--and nothing more. But I ... I could no longer live\r\nanywhere where she was not; I tore myself at one wrench from all that\r\nwas dear to me, from my native land itself, and set out in pursuit of\r\nthat woman.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you think that she was clever?--Not in the least! It sufficed to\r\ncast a glance at her low brow, it sufficed to note, if only once, her\r\nlazy, heedless smile, in order instantly to convince one\xe2\x80\x99s self as to\r\nthe paucity of her mental abilities. And I never imagined her to be a\r\nremarkable woman. On the whole, I did not deceive myself for a single\r\nminute on her score. But that did not help matters in the least.\r\nWhatever I thought of her in her absence, in her presence I felt nothing\r\nbut servile adoration.... In the German fairytales the knights often\r\nfall into that sort of stupor. I could not tear my eyes from her\r\nfeatures; I could not hear enough of her remarks, or sufficiently watch\r\nevery movement of hers; to tell the truth, I actually breathed to her\r\nbreathing. However, she was good-natured, unconstrained--too\r\nunconstrained even; she did not put on airs, as the majority of artists\r\ndo. She had a great deal of life, that is, a great deal of blood, of\r\nthat splendid Southern blood, into which the sun of their land must have\r\ndropped a portion of his rays. She slept nine hours a day, was fond of\r\ngood eating, never read a single line of print, unless, perhaps, the\r\narticles in the newspapers in which she was mentioned, and almost the\r\nsole tender sentiment in her life was her attachment to il signore\r\nCarlino, a small and greedy Italian who served as her secretary and whom\r\nshe afterward married. And with such a woman as this I, who have tasted\r\nso many varied intellectual subtleties, I, already an old man, could\r\nfall in love! Who could have expected it? I never expected it, at all\r\nevents. I did not anticipate the part which I should be compelled to\r\nplay. I did not expect that I should haunt rehearsals, freeze and get\r\nbored behind the scenes, inhale the reek of the theatre, make\r\nacquaintance with various unseemly individuals ... what am I\r\nsaying?--make acquaintance--bow to them. I had not expected that I\r\nshould carry a dancer\xe2\x80\x99s shawl, buy new gloves for her, clean her old\r\nones with white bread (but I did it, I take my oath!), cart home her\r\nbouquets, run about to the anterooms of journalists and directors, wear\r\nmyself out, give serenades, catch cold, lose my strength.... I had not\r\nexpected that I should acquire at last in a certain little German town\r\nthe ingenious nickname of \xe2\x80\x9c_der Kunst-barbar_.\xe2\x80\x9d... And all this in\r\nvain--in the fullest sense of the word, in vain! There, that is\r\nprecisely the state of the case....\r\n\r\nDo you remember how you and I, orally and by letter, argued about love,\r\ninto what subtleties we entered? And when it is put to the proof, it\r\nturns out that real love is a feeling not at all resembling that which\r\nwe imagined it to be. Love is not even a feeling at all; it is a malady,\r\na well-known condition of the soul and body. It does not develop\r\ngradually; there is no possibility of doubting it; one cannot dodge it,\r\nalthough it does not always manifest itself in identically the same\r\nfashion. It generally takes possession of a man without being invited,\r\nsuddenly, against his will--precisely like the cholera or a fever.... It\r\nlays hold upon him, the dear creature, as a hawk does upon a chicken;\r\nand it will bear him off whithersoever it wishes, struggle and resist as\r\nhe may.... In love there is no equality, no so-called free union of\r\nsouls and other ideal things, invented at their leisure by German\r\nprofessors.... No; in love one person is the slave, the other is the\r\nsovereign, and not without cause do the poets prate of the chains\r\nimposed by love. Yes, love is a chain, and the heaviest of chains at\r\nthat. At all events, I have arrived at that conviction, and have reached\r\nit by the path of experience. I have purchased that conviction at the\r\nprice of my life, because I am dying a slave.\r\n\r\nAlack, what a fate is mine! one thinks. In my youth I was resolutely\r\ndetermined to conquer heaven for myself.... Later on, I fell to dreaming\r\nabout the welfare of all mankind, the prosperity of my fatherland. Then\r\nthat passed off: I thought only of how I might arrange my domestic, my\r\nfamily life ... and I tripped over an ant-hill--and flop! I went\r\nheadlong on the ground, and into the grave.... What master hands we\r\nRussians are at winding up in that fashion!\r\n\r\nHowever, it is high time for me to turn away from all this,--it was time\r\nlong ago! May this burden fall from my soul along with my life! I wish\r\nfor the last time, if only for a moment, to enjoy that good, gentle\r\nfeeling which is diffused within me like a tranquil light as soon as I\r\ncall you to mind. Your image is now doubly dear to me.... Along with it\r\nthere surges up before me the image of my native land, and I waft to it\r\nand to you my last greeting. Live on, live long and happily, and\r\nremember one thing: whether you remain in that remote nook of the\r\nsteppes, where you sometimes find things so painful, but where I should\r\nso like to spend my last day, or whether you shall enter upon another\r\ncareer, remember: life fails to disappoint him alone who does not\r\nmeditate upon it, and, demanding nothing from it, calmly accepts its\r\nsparse gifts, and calmly makes use of them. Go forward, while you can:\r\nbut when your feet fail you,--sit down near the road, and gaze at the\r\npassers-by without vexation and without envy: for they will not go far!\r\nI have said this to you before, but death will teach any man whomsoever;\r\nmoreover, who shall say what is life, what is truth? Remember _who_ it\r\nwas that gave no answer to this question.... Farewell, M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nAlex\xc3\xa1ndrovna; farewell for the last time, and bear no ill will to poor--\r\n\r\nALEXY\xc3\x89I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGION OF DEAD CALM\r\n\r\n(1854)\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn a fairly-large recently-whitewashed chamber of a wing of the\r\nmanor-house in the village of S\xc3\xa1sovo, *** county, T*** Government, a\r\nyoung man in a paletot was sitting at a small, warped table, looking\r\nover accounts. Two stearine candles, in silver travelling-candlesticks,\r\nwere burning in front of him; in one corner, on the wall-bench, stood an\r\nopen bottle-case, in another a servant was setting up an iron bed. On\r\nthe other side of a low partition a samov\xc3\xa1r was murmuring and hissing; a\r\ndog was nestling about on some hay which had just been brought in. In\r\nthe doorway stood a peasant-man in a new overcoat girt with a red belt,\r\nwith a large beard, and an intelligent face--the overseer, judging by\r\nall the tokens. He was gazing attentively at the seated young man.\r\n\r\nAgainst one wall stood a very aged, tiny piano; beside it an\r\nequally-ancient chest of drawers with holes in place of the locks;\r\nbetween the windows a small, dim mirror was visible; on the\r\npartition-wall hung an old portrait, which was almost completely peeled\r\noff, representing a woman with powdered hair, in a _robe ronde_, and\r\nwith a black ribbon about her slender neck. Judging from the very\r\nperceptible sagging of the ceiling, and the slope of the floor, which\r\nwas full of cracks, the little wing into which we have conducted the\r\nreader had existed for a very long time. No one lived in it permanently;\r\nit was put to use when the owners came. The young man who was sitting at\r\nthe table was the owner of the village of S\xc3\xa1sovo. He had arrived only on\r\nthe previous day from his principal estate, situated a hundred\r\nversts[11] distant, and was preparing to depart on the morrow, after\r\ncompleting the inspection of the farming, listening to the demands of\r\nthe peasants, and verifying all the documents.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, that will do,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said, raising his head;--\xe2\x80\x9cI am tired. Thou\r\nmayest go now,\xe2\x80\x9d--he added, turning to the overseer;--\xe2\x80\x9cand come very\r\nearly to-morrow morning, and notify the peasants at daybreak that they\r\nare to present themselves in assembly,--dost hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI obey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd order the estate-clerk to present to me the report for the last\r\nmonth. But thou hast done well,\xe2\x80\x9d--the gentleman went on, casting a\r\nglance around him,--\xe2\x80\x9cin whitewashing the walls. Everything seems\r\ncleaner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe overseer silently swept a glance around the walls also.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, go now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe overseer made his obeisance and left the room.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman stretched himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHey!\xe2\x80\x9d--he shouted,--\xe2\x80\x9cGive me some tea!... \xe2\x80\x99Tis time to go to bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis servant went to the other side of the partition, and speedily\r\nreturned with a glass of tea, a bundle of town cracknels, and a\r\ncream-jug on an iron tray. The gentleman began to drink tea, but before\r\nhe had had time to swallow two mouthfuls, the noise of persons entering\r\nresounded from an adjoining room, and some one\xe2\x80\x99s squeaking voice\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch Ast\xc3\xa1khoff at home? Can he be seen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch (that was the name of the young man in the paletot)\r\ncast a glance of surprise at his man, and said in a hurried whisper:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo, find out who it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man withdrew, slamming behind him the door, which closed badly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnnounce to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\xe2\x80\x9d--rang out the same squeaking voice as\r\nbefore,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat his neighbour Ip\xc3\xa1toff wishes to see him, if it will not\r\nincommode him; and another neighbour has come with me, Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff, Iv\xc3\xa1n\r\n\xc3\x8dlitch, who also desires to pay his respects.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch made an involuntary gesture of vexation.\r\nNevertheless, when his man entered the room, he said to him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk them in.\xe2\x80\x9d And he arose to receive his visitors.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the visitors made their appearance. One of them, a\r\nrobust, grey-haired little old man, with a small, round head and bright\r\nlittle eyes, walked in advance; the other, a tall, thin man of\r\nthree-and-thirty, with a long, swarthy face and dishevelled hair, walked\r\nbehind, with a shambling gait. The old man wore a neat grey coat with\r\nlarge, mother-of-pearl buttons; a small, pink neckerchief, half\r\nconcealed by the rolling collar of his white shirt, loosely encircled\r\nhis neck; his feet shone resplendent in gaiters; the plaids of his\r\nScotch trousers were agreeably gay in hue; and, altogether, he produced\r\na pleasant impression. His companion, on the contrary, evoked in the\r\nspectator a less favourable sensation: he wore an old black dress-coat,\r\nbuttoned up to the throat; his full trousers, of thick, winter tricot,\r\nmatched his coat in colour; no linen was visible, either around his\r\nthroat or around his wrists. The little old man was the first to\r\napproach Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, and, with an amiable inclination of the\r\nhead, he began in the same shrill little voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have the honour to introduce myself,--your nearest neighbour, and\r\neven a relative, Ip\xc3\xa1toff, Mikha\xc3\xadlo Nikol\xc3\xa1itch. I have long wished to\r\nhave the pleasure of making your acquaintance. I hope that I have not\r\ndisturbed you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch replied that he was very glad to see him, and that\r\nhe was not disturbed in the least, and would not he take a seat ... and\r\ndrink tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this nobleman,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on the little old man, after listening with a\r\ncourteous smile to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s unfinished phrases, and\r\nextending his hand in the direction of the gentleman in the\r\ndress-coat,--\xe2\x80\x9calso your neighbour ... and my good acquaintance, Iv\xc3\xa1n\r\n\xc3\x8dlitch, strongly desired to make your acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe gentleman in the dress-coat, from whose countenance no one would\r\nhave suspected that he was capable of desiring anything strongly in his\r\nlife--so preoccupied and, at the same time, so sleepy was the expression\r\nof that countenance,--the gentleman in the dress-coat bowed clumsily and\r\nlanguidly. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch bowed to him in return, and again invited\r\nthe visitors to be seated.\r\n\r\nThe visitors sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad,\xe2\x80\x9d--began the little old man, pleasantly throwing apart\r\nhis hands, while his companion set to scrutinising the ceiling, with his\r\nmouth slightly open:--\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad that I have, at last, the honour\r\nof seeing you personally. Although you have your permanent residence in\r\na county which lies at a considerable distance from these localities,\r\nstill, we regard you also as one of our own primordial landed\r\nproprietors, so to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is very flattering to me,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlattering or not, it is a fact. You must excuse us, Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch; we people here in *** county are a straightforward folk; we\r\nlive in our simplicity; we say what we think, without circumlocution. It\r\nis our custom, I must tell you, not to call upon each other on\r\nName-days[12] otherwise than in our frock-coats. Truly! We have made\r\nthat the rule. On that account, we are called \xe2\x80\x98frock-coaters\xe2\x80\x99 in the\r\nadjoining counties, and we are even reproached for our bad style; but we\r\npay no attention to that! Pray, what is the use of living in the\r\ncountry--and then standing on ceremony?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, what can be better ... in the country ... than that\r\nnaturalness of intercourse,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied the little old man,--\xe2\x80\x9camong us in our county dwell\r\npeople of the cleverest sort,--one may say people of European culture,\r\nalthough they do not wear dress-suits. Take, for example, our historian\r\nEvsiuk\xc3\xb3ff, Step\xc3\xa1n Step\xc3\xa1nitch: he is interesting himself in Russian\r\nhistory from the most ancient times, and is known in Petersburg--an\r\nextremely learned man! There is in our town an ancient Swedish\r\ncannon-ball ... \xe2\x80\x99tis placed yonder, in the centre of the public square\r\n... and \xe2\x80\x99twas he who discovered it, you know! Certainly! Tz\xc3\xa9nteler,\r\nAnt\xc3\xb3n K\xc3\xa1rlitch ... now he has studied natural history; but they say all\r\nGermans are successful in that line. When, ten years ago, a stray hyena\r\nwas killed in our vicinity, it was this Ant\xc3\xb3n K\xc3\xa1rlitch who discovered\r\nthat it really was a hyena, by cause of the peculiar construction of its\r\ntail. And then, we have a landed proprietor Kaburd\xc3\xadn: he chiefly writes\r\nlight articles; he wields a very dashing pen; his articles appear in\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Galatea.\xe2\x80\x99 Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff, ... not Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch; no, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch neglects\r\nthat; but another Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff, Sergy\xc3\xa9i ... what the deuce was his\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s baptismal name, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch ... what the deuce was it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSergy\xc3\xa9itch,\xe2\x80\x9d--prompted Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; Sergy\xc3\xa9i Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,--he busies himself with writing verses. Well,\r\nof course he\xe2\x80\x99s not a P\xc3\xbashkin, but sometimes he gets off things which\r\nwould pass muster even in the capitals. Do you know his epigram on Ag\xc3\xa9i\r\nF\xc3\xb3mitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Ag\xc3\xa9i F\xc3\xb3mitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, pardon me; I keep forgetting that you are not a resident here,\r\nafter all. He is our chief of police. The epigram is extremely amusing.\r\nThou rememberest it, I believe, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAg\xc3\xa9i F\xc3\xb3mitch,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff, indifferently--\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c ... not without cause is gloriously\r\n     By the nobles\xe2\x80\x99 election honoured....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d--broke in Ip\xc3\xa1toff,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat he was elected almost\r\nexclusively by white balls, for he is a most worthy man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAg\xc3\xa9i F\xc3\xb3mitch,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff,\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9c ... not without cause is gloriously\r\n     By the nobles\xe2\x80\x99 election honoured:\r\n     He drinks and eats regularly....\r\n     So why should not he be the regulator of order?\xe2\x80\x9d[13]\r\n\r\nThe little old man burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa, ha, ha! that isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad, is it? Ever since then, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll believe\r\nme, each one of us will say, for instance, to Ag\xc3\xa9i F\xc3\xb3mitch: \xe2\x80\x98Good\r\nmorning!\xe2\x80\x99--and will invariably add: \xe2\x80\x98so why should not he be the\r\nregulator of order?\xe2\x80\x99 And does Ag\xc3\xa9i F\xc3\xb3mitch get angry, think you? Not in\r\nthe least. No--that\xe2\x80\x99s not our way. Just ask Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch here if it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch merely rolled up his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGet angry at a jest--how is that possible? Now, take Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch\r\nthere; his nickname among us is \xe2\x80\x98The Folding Soul,\xe2\x80\x99 because he agrees to\r\neverything very promptly. What then? Does Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch take offence at\r\nthat? Never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, slowly blinking his eyes, looked first at the little old\r\nman, then at Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\nThe epithet, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Folding Soul,\xe2\x80\x9d really did fit Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch admirably.\r\nThere was not a trace in him of what is called will or character. Any\r\none who wished could lead him whithersoever he would; all that was\r\nnecessary was to say to him: \xe2\x80\x9cCome on, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch!\xe2\x80\x9d--and he picked up\r\nhis cap and went; but if another person turned up, and said to him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalt, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch!\xe2\x80\x9d--he laid down his cap and remained. He was of a\r\npeaceable, tranquil disposition, had lived a bachelor-life, did not play\r\ncards, but was fond of sitting beside the players and looking into each\r\nof their faces in turn. Without society he could not exist, and solitude\r\nhe could not endure. At such times he became despondent; however, this\r\nhappened very rarely with him. He had another peculiarity: rising from\r\nhis bed betimes in the morning, he would sing in an undertone an old\r\nromance:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cIn the country once a Baron\r\n     Dwelt in simplicity rural....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this peculiarity of Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch\xe2\x80\x99s, he was also called\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hawfinch,\xe2\x80\x9d because, as is well known, the hawfinch when in\r\ncaptivity sings only once in the course of the day, early in the\r\nmorning. Such was Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff.\r\n\r\nThe conversation between Ip\xc3\xa1toff and Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch lasted for\r\nquite a long time, but not in its original, so to speak, speculative\r\ndirection. The little old man questioned Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch about his\r\nestate, the condition of his forests and other sorts of land, the\r\nimprovements which he had already introduced or was only intending to\r\nintroduce in his farming; he imparted to him several of his own\r\nobservations; advised him, among other things, in order to get rid of\r\nhummocky pastures, to sprinkle them with oats, which, he said, would\r\ninduce the pigs to plough them up with their snouts, and so forth. But,\r\nat last, perceiving that Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was so sleepy that he could\r\nhardly keep his eyes open, and that a certain deliberation and\r\nincoherence were making themselves evident in his speech, the little old\r\nman rose, and, with a courteous obeisance, declared that he would not\r\nincommode him any longer with his presence, but that he hoped to have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing the valued guest at his own house not later than\r\nthe following day, at dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the first person you meet, not to mention any small child, but, so\r\nto speak, any hen or peasant-woman,\xe2\x80\x9d--he added,--\xe2\x80\x9cwill point out to you\r\nthe road to my village. All you have to do is to ask for Ip\xc3\xa1toff. The\r\nhorses will trot there of themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch replied with a little hesitation--which, however,\r\nwas natural to him--that he would try ... that if nothing prevented....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we shall certainly expect you,\xe2\x80\x9d--the little old man interrupted\r\nhim, cordially, shook his hand warmly, and briskly withdrew, exclaiming\r\nin the doorway, as he half turned round:--\xe2\x80\x9cWithout ceremony!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFolding Soul\xe2\x80\x9d Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff bowed in silence and vanished in the wake of\r\nhis companion, with a preliminary stumble on the threshold.\r\n\r\nHaving seen his unexpected guests off, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch immediately\r\nundressed, got into bed, and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch Ast\xc3\xa1khoff belonged to the category of people who,\r\nafter having cautiously tested their powers in two or three different\r\ncareers, are wont to say of themselves that they have finally come to\r\nthe conclusion to look at life from a practical point of view, and who\r\ndevote their leisure to augmenting their revenues. He was not stupid,\r\nwas rather penurious, and very sensible; was fond of reading, of\r\nsociety, of music--but all in moderation ... and bore himself very\r\ndecorously. He was twenty-seven years old. A great many young men of\r\nhis sort have sprung up recently. He was of medium height, well built,\r\nand had agreeable though small features; their expression almost never\r\nvaried; his eyes always gleamed with one and the same stern, bright\r\nglance; only now and then did this glance soften with a faint shade of\r\nsomething which was not precisely sadness, nor yet precisely boredom; a\r\ncourteous smile rarely quitted his lips. He had very handsome, fair\r\nhair, silky, and falling in long ringlets. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch owned\r\nabout six hundred souls[14] on a good estate, and he was thinking of\r\nmarriage--a marriage of inclination, but which should, at the same time,\r\nbe advantageous. He was particularly desirous of finding a wife with\r\npowerful connections. In a word, he merited the appellation of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x9d which had recently come into vogue.\r\n\r\nWhen he rose on the following morning, very early, according to his\r\nwont, our gentleman occupied himself with business, and, we must do him\r\nthe justice to say, did so in a decidedly practical manner, which cannot\r\nalways be said of practical young men among us in Russia. He patiently\r\nlistened to the confused petitions and complaints of the peasants, gave\r\nthem satisfaction so far as he was able, investigated the quarrels and\r\ndissensions which had arisen between relatives, exhorted some, scolded\r\nothers, audited the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s accounts, brought to light two or three\r\nrascalities on the part of the overseer--in a word, handled matters in\r\nsuch wise that he was very well satisfied with himself, and the\r\npeasants, as they returned from the assembly to their homes, spoke well\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his promise given on the preceding evening to Ip\xc3\xa1toff,\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch had made up his mind to dine at home, and had even\r\nordered his travelling-cook to prepare his favourite rice-soup with\r\npluck; but all of a sudden, possibly in consequence of that feeling of\r\nsatisfaction which had filled his soul ever since the early morning, he\r\nstopped short in the middle of the room, smote himself on the brow with\r\nhis hand, and, not without some spirit, exclaimed aloud: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ngo to that flowery old babbler!\xe2\x80\x9d No sooner said than done; half an hour\r\nlater he was sitting in his new tarant\xc3\xa1s, drawn by four stout\r\npeasant-horses, and driving to Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s house, which was reckoned to be\r\nnot more than twenty-five versts distant by a capital road.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMikha\xc3\xadlo Nikol\xc3\xa1evitch Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s manor consisted of two separate small\r\nmansions, built opposite each other on the two sides of a huge pond\r\nthrough which ran a river. A long dam, planted with silver poplars,\r\nshut off the pond; almost on a level with it the red roof of a small\r\nhand-mill was visible. Built exactly alike, and painted with the same\r\nlilac hue, the tiny houses seemed to be exchanging glances across the\r\nbroad, watery expanse, with the glittering panes of their small, clean\r\nwindows. From the middle of each little house a circular terrace\r\nprojected, and a sharp-peaked pediment rose aloft, supported by four\r\nwhite pillars set close together. The ancient park ran all the way round\r\nthe pond; lindens stretched out in alleys, and stood in dense clumps;\r\naged pine-trees, with pale yellow boles, dark oaks, magnificent maples\r\nhere and there reared high in air their solitary crests; the dense\r\nverdure of the thickly-spreading lilacs and acacias advanced close up to\r\nthe very sides of the two little houses, leaving revealed only their\r\nfronts, from which winding paths paved with brick ran down the slope.\r\nMotley-hued ducks, white and grey geese were swimming in separate flocks\r\non the clear water of the pond; it never became covered with scum,\r\nthanks to abundant springs which welled into its \xe2\x80\x9chead\xe2\x80\x9d from the base of\r\nthe steep, rocky ravine. The situation of the manor was good, pleasant,\r\nisolated, and beautiful.\r\n\r\nIn one of the two little houses dwelt Mikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1evitch himself; in\r\nthe other lived his mother, a decrepit old woman of seventy years. When\r\nhe drove on to the dam, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch did not know to which house\r\nto betake himself. He glanced about him: a small urchin of the\r\nhouse-serfs was fishing, as he stood barefooted on a half-rotten\r\ntree-stump. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch hailed him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to whom are you going--to the old lady or to the young\r\nmaster?\xe2\x80\x9d--replied the urchin, without taking his eyes from his float.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat lady?\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cI want to find Mikha\xc3\xadlo\r\nNikol\xc3\xa1itch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the young master? Well, then, turn to the right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the lad gave his line a jerk, and drew from the motionless water a\r\nsmall, silvery carp. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch drove to the right.\r\n\r\nMikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1itch was playing at draughts with The Folding Soul when\r\nthe arrival of Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was announced to him. He was\r\ndelighted, sprang from his arm-chair, ran out into the anteroom and\r\nthere kissed the visitor three times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou find me with my invariable friend, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\xe2\x80\x9d--began the\r\nloquacious little old man:--\xe2\x80\x9cwith Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, who, I will remark in\r\npassing, is completely enchanted with your affability.\xe2\x80\x9d (Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch\r\ndarted a silent glance at the corner.) \xe2\x80\x9cHe was so kind as to remain to\r\nplay draughts with me, while all my household went for a stroll in the\r\npark; but I will send for them at once....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why disturb them?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch tried to expostulate....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least inconvenience, I assure you. Hey, there, V\xc3\xa1nka, run for\r\nthe young ladies as fast as thou canst ... tell them that a guest has\r\nfavoured us with a visit. And how does this locality please you? It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot bad, is it? Kaburd\xc3\xadn has composed some verses about it. \xe2\x80\x98Ip\xc3\xa1tovka,\r\nrefuge lovely\xe2\x80\x99--that\xe2\x80\x99s the way they begin,--and the rest of it is just\r\nas good, only I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember all of it. The park is large, that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ntrouble; beyond my means. And these two houses, which are so much alike,\r\nas you have, perhaps, deigned to observe, were erected by two\r\nbrothers--my father Nikol\xc3\xa1i, and my uncle Sergy\xc3\xa9i; they also laid out\r\nthe park; they were exemplary friends ... Damon and ... there now! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nforgotten the other man\xe2\x80\x99s name....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPythion,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot really? Well, never mind.\xe2\x80\x9d (At home the old man talked in a much\r\nmore unconventional manner than when he was paying calls.)--\xe2\x80\x9cYou are,\r\nprobably, not ignorant of the fact, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, that I am a\r\nwidower, that I have lost my wife; my elder children are in government\r\neducational institutions,[15] and I have with me only the youngest two,\r\nand my sister-in-law lives with me--my wife\xe2\x80\x99s sister; you will see her\r\ndirectly. But why don\xe2\x80\x99t I offer you some refreshment? Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, my\r\ndear fellow, see to a little luncheon ... what sort of vodka are you\r\npleased to prefer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI drink nothing until dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, how is that possible! However, as you please. The truest\r\nhospitality is to let the guest do as he likes. We are very\r\nsimple-mannered folk here, you see. Here with us, if I may venture so to\r\nexpress myself, we live not so much in a lonely as in a dead-calm place,\r\na remote nook--that\xe2\x80\x99s what! But why don\xe2\x80\x99t you sit down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch seated himself, without letting go of his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to relieve you,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff, and delicately taking his hat\r\nfrom him, he carried it off to a corner, then returned, looked his\r\nvisitor in the eye with a cordial smile, and, not knowing just what\r\nagreeable thing to say to him, inquired, in the most hearty\r\nmanner,--whether he was fond of playing draughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI play all games badly,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s a very fine thing in you,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Ip\xc3\xa1toff:--\xe2\x80\x9cbut draughts\r\nis not a game, but rather a diversion--a way of passing leisure time;\r\nisn\xe2\x80\x99t that so, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch cast an indifferent glance at Ip\xc3\xa1toff, as though he were\r\nthinking to himself, \xe2\x80\x9cThe devil only knows whether it is a game or a\r\ndiversion,\xe2\x80\x9d but, after waiting a while, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; draughts don\xe2\x80\x99t count.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChess is quite another matter, they say,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued Ip\xc3\xa1toff;--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99tis a\r\nvery difficult game, I\xe2\x80\x99m told. But, in my opinion ... but yonder come my\r\npeople!\xe2\x80\x9d--he interrupted himself, glancing through the half-open glass\r\ndoor, which gave upon the park.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch rose, turned round, and beheld first two little\r\ngirls, about ten years of age, in pink cotton frocks and broad-brimmed\r\nhats, who were running alertly up the steps of the terrace; not far\r\nbehind them a tall, plump, well-built young girl of twenty, in a dark\r\ngown, made her appearance. They all entered the house, and the little\r\ngirls courtesied sedately to the visitor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, sir, let me present you,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the host;--\xe2\x80\x9cmy daughters, sir.\r\nThis one here is named K\xc3\xa1tya, and this one is N\xc3\xa1stya, and this is my\r\nsister-in-law, M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, whom I have already had the pleasure of\r\nmentioning to you. I beg that you will love and favour them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch made his bow to M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna; she replied to him\r\nwith a barely perceptible inclination of the head.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna held in her hand a large, open knife; her thick,\r\nruddy-blond hair was slightly dishevelled,--a small green leaf had got\r\nentangled in it, her braids had escaped from the comb,--her\r\ndark-skinned face was flushed, and her red lips were parted; her gown\r\nlooked crumpled. She was breathing fast; her eyes were sparkling; it was\r\nevident that she had been working in the garden. She immediately left\r\nthe room; the little girls ran out after her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going to rearrange her toilet a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked the old man,\r\nturning to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cthey can\xe2\x80\x99t get along without that,\r\nsir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch grinned at him in response, and became somewhat\r\npensive. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna had made an impression on him. It was long since\r\nhe had seen such a purely Russian beauty of the steppes. She speedily\r\nreturned, sat down on the divan, and remained motionless. She had\r\nsmoothed her hair, but had not changed her gown,--had not even put on\r\ncuffs. Her features expressed not precisely pride, but rather austerity,\r\nalmost harshness; her brow was broad and low, her nose short and\r\nstraight; a slow, lazy smile curled her lips from time to time; her\r\nstraight eyebrows contracted scornfully. She kept her large, dark eyes\r\nalmost constantly lowered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d her repellent young face seemed to\r\nbe saying; \xe2\x80\x9cI know that you are all looking at me; well, then, look; you\r\nbore me.\xe2\x80\x9d But when she raised her eyes, there was something wild,\r\nbeautiful, and stolid about them, which was suggestive of the eyes of a\r\ndoe. She had a magnificent figure. A classical poet would have compared\r\nher to Ceres or Juno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you been doing in the garden?\xe2\x80\x9d--Ip\xc3\xa1toff asked her, being\r\ndesirous of bringing her into the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been cutting off dead branches, and digging up the flower-beds,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nshe replied, in a voice which was rather low, but agreeable and\r\nresonant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you tired?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe children are; I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d--interposed the old man, with a smile;--\xe2\x80\x9cthou art a regular\r\nBob\xc3\xa9lina! And have you been to grandmamma\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; she is asleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you fond of flowers?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy dost thou not put on thy hat when thou goest out of\r\ndoors?\xe2\x80\x9d--Ip\xc3\xa1toff remarked to her.--\xe2\x80\x9cJust see how red and sunburned thou\r\nart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe silently passed her hand over her face. Her hands were not large,\r\nbut rather broad, and decidedly red. She did not wear gloves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you fond of gardening?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch put another\r\nquestion to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch began to narrate what a fine garden there was in his\r\nneighbourhood, belonging to a wealthy landed proprietor named\r\nN***.--The head gardener, a German, received in wages alone two thousand\r\nrubles, silver[16]--he said, among other things.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is the name of that gardener?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch,\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,--Meyer or M\xc3\xbcller, I think. But why do you ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor no reason in particular, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch.--\xe2\x80\x9cTo find out\r\nhis name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch continued his narration. The little girls, Mikha\xc3\xadl\r\nNikol\xc3\xa1itch\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, entered, sat down quietly, and quietly began to\r\nlisten....\r\n\r\nA servant made his appearance at the door, had announced that Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch had arrived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Ask him in, ask him in!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Ip\xc3\xa1toff.\r\n\r\nThere entered a short, fat little old man, one of the sort of people who\r\nare called squat or dumpy, with a puffy and, at the same time, a\r\nwrinkled little face, after the fashion of a baked apple. He wore a grey\r\nhussar jacket with black braiding and a standing collar; his full\r\ncoffee-coloured velveteen trousers ended far above his ankles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, my most respected Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch,\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Ip\xc3\xa1toff,\r\nadvancing to meet him.--\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen each other for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be helped,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch in a lisping and\r\nwhining voice, after having preliminarily exchanged salutations with all\r\npresent;--\xe2\x80\x9csurely you know, Mikha\xc3\xadl Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, whether I am a free man\r\nor not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are you not a free man, Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course I\xe2\x80\x99m not, Mikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1itch; there\xe2\x80\x99s my family, my\r\naffairs.... And there\xe2\x80\x99s Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna to boot,\xe2\x80\x9d and he waved his\r\nhand in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what about Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Ip\xc3\xa1toff launched a slight wink at Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, as though\r\ndesirous of exciting his interest in advance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, everybody knows,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch, as he took a\r\nseat;--\xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s always discontented with me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know that? Whatever\r\nI say, it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, not delicate, not decorous. And why it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndecorous, the Lord God alone knows. And the young ladies, my daughters\r\nthat is to say, do the same, taking pattern by their mother. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say\r\nbut what Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna is a very fine woman, but she\xe2\x80\x99s awfully\r\nsevere on the score of manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, good gracious! in what way are your manners bad, Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know myself; but, evidently, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhard to suit. Yesterday, for instance, I said at table: \xe2\x80\x98Matry\xc3\xb3na\r\nM\xc3\xa1rkovna,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch imparted to his voice an insinuating\r\ninflection,--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the meaning of\r\nthis,--that Ald\xc3\xb3shka isn\xe2\x80\x99t careful with the horses, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to\r\ndrive?\xe2\x80\x99 says I; \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s the black stallion quite foundered.\xe2\x80\x99--I-iikh!\r\nhow Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna did flare up, and set to crying shame on me: \xe2\x80\x98Thou\r\ndost not know how to express thyself decently in the society of ladies,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays she; and the young ladies instantly galloped away from the table,\r\nand on the next day, the Biri\xc3\xbaloff young ladies, my wife\xe2\x80\x99s nieces, had\r\nheard all about it. And how had I expressed myself badly? And no matter\r\nwhat I say--and sometimes I really am incautious,--no matter to whom I\r\nsay it, especially at home,--those Biri\xc3\xbaloff girls know all about it the\r\nnext day. A fellow simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m just\r\nsitting so, thinking after my fashion,--I breathe hard, as perhaps you\r\nknow,--and Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna sets to berating me again: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t snore,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsays she; \xe2\x80\x98nobody snores nowadays!\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98What art thou scolding about,\r\nMatry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna?\xe2\x80\x99 says I. \xe2\x80\x98Good mercy, thou shouldst have compassion,\r\nbut thou scoldest.\xe2\x80\x99 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t meditate at home any more. I sit and look\r\ndown--so--all the time. By Heaven, I do. And then, again, not long ago,\r\nwe got into bed; \xe2\x80\x98Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna,\xe2\x80\x99 says I, \xe2\x80\x98what makes thee spoil\r\nthy page-boy, m\xc3\xa1tushka?[17] Why, he\xe2\x80\x99s a regular little pig,\xe2\x80\x99 says I,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and he might wash his face of a Sunday, at least.\xe2\x80\x99 And what happened?\r\nIt strikes me that I said it distantly, tenderly, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the\r\nmark even then; Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna began to cry shame on me again: \xe2\x80\x98Thou\r\ndost not understand how to behave in the society of ladies,\xe2\x80\x99 says she;\r\nand the next day the Biri\xc3\xbaloff girls knew all about it. What time have I\r\nto think of visits under such circumstances, Mikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1itch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m amazed at what you tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Ip\xc3\xa1toff;--\xe2\x80\x9cI did not expect\r\nthat from Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna. Apparently, she is....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn extremely fine woman,\xe2\x80\x9d--put in Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch;--\xe2\x80\x9ca model wife and\r\nmother, so to speak, only strict on the score of manners. She says that\r\n_ensemble_ is necessary in everything, and that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got it. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t speak French, as you are aware, I only understand it. But what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat _ensemble_ that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff, who was not very strong in French himself, only shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are your children--your sons, that is to say?\xe2\x80\x9d--he asked Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch after a brief pause.\r\n\r\nEg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch darted an oblique glance at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sons are all right. I\xe2\x80\x99m satisfied with them. The girls have got out\r\nof hand, but I\xe2\x80\x99m satisfied with my sons. Ly\xc3\xb3lya discharges his service\r\nwell, his superior officers approve of him; that Ly\xc3\xb3lya of mine is a\r\nclever fellow. Well, M\xc3\xadkhetz--he\xe2\x80\x99s not like that; he has turned out some\r\nsort of a philanthropist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy a philanthropist?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lord knows; he speaks to nobody, he shuns folks. Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna\r\nmostly abashes him. \xe2\x80\x98Why dost thou take pattern by thy father?\xe2\x80\x99 she says\r\nto him. \xe2\x80\x98Do thou respect him, but copy thy mother as to manners.\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget straightened out, he\xe2\x80\x99ll turn out all right also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch asked Ip\xc3\xa1toff to introduce him to Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch.\r\nThey entered into conversation. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna did not take part in it;\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch seated himself beside her, and said two words, in all, to\r\nher; the little girls came up to him, and began to narrate something to\r\nhim in a whisper.... The housekeeper entered, a gaunt old woman, with\r\nher head bound up in a dark kerchief, and announced that dinner was\r\nready. All wended their way to the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe dinner lasted for quite a long time. Ip\xc3\xa1toff kept a good cook, and\r\nordered pretty good wines, not from Moscow, but from the capital of the\r\ngovernment. Ip\xc3\xa1toff lived at his ease, as the saying goes. He did not\r\nown more than three hundred souls, but he was not in debt to any one,\r\nand had brought his estate into order. At table, the host himself did\r\nthe greater part of the talking; Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch chimed in, but did not\r\nforget himself, at the same time; he ate and drank gloriously. M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna preserved unbroken silence, only now and then replying with\r\nhalf-smiles to the hurried remarks of the two little girls, who sat one\r\non each side of her. They were, evidently, very fond of her. Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch made several attempts to enter into conversation with her,\r\nbut without particular success. Folding Soul Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff even ate\r\nindolently and languidly. After dinner all went out on the terrace to\r\ndrink coffee. The weather was magnificent; from the garden was wafted\r\nthe sweet perfume of the lindens, which were then in full flower; the\r\nsummer air, slightly cooled by the thick shade of the trees, and the\r\nhumidity of the adjacent pond, breathed forth a sort of caressing\r\nwarmth. Suddenly, from behind the poplars of the dam, the trampling of a\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs became audible, and a moment later, a horsewoman made her\r\nappearance in a long riding-habit and a grey hat, mounted on a bay\r\nhorse; she was riding at a gallop; a page was galloping behind her, on a\r\nsmall, white cob.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Ip\xc3\xa1toff,--\xe2\x80\x9cNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna is coming. What a\r\npleasant surprise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, who up to that moment had been standing\r\nmotionless in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlone.... Evidently, something has detained Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9evitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna darted a sidelong glance from beneath her brows, a flush\r\noverspread her face, and she turned away.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the horsewoman had ridden through the wicket-gate into\r\nthe garden, galloped up to the terrace, and sprang lightly to the\r\nground, without waiting either for her groom or for Ip\xc3\xa1toff, who had\r\nstarted to meet her. Briskly gathering up the train of her riding-habit,\r\nshe ran up the steps, and springing upon the terrace, exclaimed\r\nblithely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWelcome!\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff.--\xe2\x80\x9cHow unexpected, how charming this is! Allow\r\nme to kiss your hand....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned the visitor; \xe2\x80\x9conly, you must pull off the glove\r\nyourself.--I cannot.\xe2\x80\x9d And, extending her hand to him, she nodded to\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.--\xe2\x80\x9cJust fancy, M\xc3\xa1sha, my brother will not be here\r\nto-day,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, with a little sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see for myself that he is not here,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna in an\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe bade me say to thee that he is busy. Thou must not be angry. Good\r\nmorning, Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch; good morning, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch; good morning,\r\nchildren.... V\xc3\xa1sya,\xe2\x80\x9d--added the guest, turning to her small\r\ngroom,--\xe2\x80\x9corder them to walk Little Beauty up and down well, dost hear?\r\nM\xc3\xa1sha, please give me a pin, to fasten up my train.... Come here,\r\nMikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1itch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff went closer to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that new person?\xe2\x80\x9d--she asked, quite loudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a neighbour, Ast\xc3\xa1khoff, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9evitch, you know, the\r\nowner of S\xc3\xa1sovo. I\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce him if you like, shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well ... afterward. Akh, what splendid weather!\xe2\x80\x9d--she went\r\non.--\xe2\x80\x9cEg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch, tell me--can it be possible that Matry\xc3\xb3na\r\nM\xc3\xa1rkovna growls even in such weather as this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna never grumbles in any sort of weather, madam; and she\r\nis merely strict on the score of manners....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are the Biri\xc3\xbaloff girls doing? They know all about it the next\r\nday, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?...\xe2\x80\x9d And she burst into a ringing, silvery laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are pleased to laugh constantly,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch.--\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, when should a person laugh, if not at your age?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch, don\xe2\x80\x99t get angry, my dear man! Akh, I\xe2\x80\x99m tired; allow\r\nme to sit down....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna dropped into an arm-chair, and playfully pulled her\r\nhat down over her very eyes.\r\n\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff led Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch up to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, to present to you our neighbour, Mr.\r\nAst\xc3\xa1khoff, of whom you have, probably, heard a great deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch made his bow, while Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna looked up at\r\nhim from under the brim of her round hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna V\xc3\xa9retyeff, our neighbour,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on Ip\xc3\xa1toff,\r\nturning to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cShe lives here with her brother, Pi\xc3\xb3tr\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9itch, a retired lieutenant of the Guards. She is a great friend of\r\nmy sister-in-law, and bears good will to our household in general.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA whole formal inventory,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, laughing, and, as\r\nbefore, scanning Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch from under her hat.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was thinking to himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\r\nthis is a very pretty woman also.\xe2\x80\x9d And, in fact, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna was\r\na very charming young girl. Slender and graceful, she appeared much\r\nyounger than she really was. She was already in her twenty-eighth year.\r\nShe had a round face, a small head, fluffy fair hair, a sharp, almost\r\naudaciously upturned little nose, and merry, almost crafty little eyes.\r\nMockery fairly glittered in them, and kindled in them in sparks. Her\r\nfeatures, extremely vivacious and mobile, sometimes assumed an almost\r\namusing expression; humour peered forth from them. Now and then, for the\r\nmost part suddenly, a shade of pensiveness flitted across her face,--and\r\nat such times it became gentle and kindly; but she could not surrender\r\nherself long to meditation. She easily seized upon the ridiculous sides\r\nof people, and drew very respectable caricatures. Everybody had petted\r\nher ever since she was born, and that is something which is immediately\r\nperceptible; people who have been spoiled in childhood preserve a\r\ncertain stamp to the end of their lives. Her brother loved her, although\r\nhe asserted that she stung, not like a bee, but like a wasp; because a\r\nbee stings and then dies, whereas it signifies nothing for a wasp to\r\nsting. This comparison enraged her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you come here for long?\xe2\x80\x9d--she asked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, dropping\r\nher eyes, and twisting her riding-whip in her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I intend to go away from here to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHome? Why, may I venture to ask?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by \xe2\x80\x98why\xe2\x80\x99? I have affairs at home which do not brook\r\ndelay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you such a ... punctual man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI try to be a punctual man,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cIn our\r\nsedate era, every honourable man _must_ be sedate and punctual.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is perfectly just,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Ip\xc3\xa1toff.--\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that true Iv\xc3\xa1n\r\n\xc3\x8dlitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch merely glanced at Ip\xc3\xa1toff; but Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch remarked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that\xe2\x80\x99s so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna;--\xe2\x80\x9cprecisely what we lack is a\r\n_jeune premier_. You know how to act comedy, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never put my powers in that line to the test.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced that you would act well. You have that sort of bearing\r\n... a stately mien, which is indispensable in a _jeune premier_. My\r\nbrother and I are preparing to set up a theatre here. However, we shall\r\nnot act comedies only: we shall act all sorts of things--dramas,\r\nballets, and even tragedies. Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t M\xc3\xa1sha do for Cleopatra or\r\nPh\xc3\xa8dre? Just look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch turned round.... M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna was gazing\r\nthoughtfully into the distance, as she stood leaning her head against\r\nthe door, with folded arms.... At that moment, her regular features\r\nreally did suggest the faces of ancient statues. She did not catch\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna\xe2\x80\x99s last words; but, perceiving that the glances of\r\nall present were suddenly directed to her, she immediately divined what\r\nwas going on, blushed, and was about to retreat into the\r\ndrawing-room.... Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna briskly grasped her by the hand\r\nand, with the coquettish caressing action of a kitten, drew her toward\r\nher, and kissed that almost masculine hand. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna flushed more\r\nvividly than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art always playing pranks, N\xc3\xa1dya,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I speak the truth about thee? I am ready to appeal to all....\r\nWell, enough, enough, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again. But I will say again,\xe2\x80\x9d--went\r\non Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, addressing Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat it is a\r\npity you are going away. We have a _jeune premier_, it is true; he calls\r\nhimself so, but he is very bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is he? permit me to inquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBodryak\xc3\xb3ff the poet. How can a poet be a _jeune premier_? In the first\r\nplace, he dresses in the most frightful way; in the second place, he\r\nwrites epigrams, and gets shy in the presence of every woman, even in\r\nmine. He lisps, one of his hands is always higher than his head, and I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what besides. Tell me, please, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Ast\xc3\xa1khoff, are all\r\npoets like that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch drew himself up slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never known a single one of them, personally; but I must confess\r\nthat I have never sought acquaintance with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, you certainly are a positive man. We shall have to take\r\nBodryak\xc3\xb3ff; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else to be done. Other _jeunes premiers_ are\r\neven worse. That one, at all events, will learn his part by heart.\r\nM\xc3\xa1sha, in addition to tragic r\xc3\xb4les, will fill the post of prima\r\ndonna.... You haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard her sing, have you, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Ast\xc3\xa1khoff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, displaying his teeth in a smile;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand I did not know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter with thee to-day, N\xc3\xa1dya?\xe2\x80\x9d--said M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, with\r\na look of displeasure.\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna sprang to her feet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake, M\xc3\xa1sha, do sing us something, please.... I won\xe2\x80\x99t let\r\nthee alone until thou singest us something, M\xc3\xa1sha dearest. I would sing\r\nmyself, to entertain the visitors, but thou knowest what a bad voice I\r\nhave. But, on the other hand, thou shalt see how splendidly I will\r\naccompany thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no getting rid of thee,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said at last.--\xe2\x80\x9cLike a spoiled\r\nchild, thou art accustomed to have all thy caprices humoured. I will\r\nsing, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo, bravo!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, clapping her\r\nhands.--\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go into the drawing-room, gentlemen.--And as for\r\ncaprices,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, laughing,--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you off for that! Is it\r\npermissible to expose my weaknesses in the presence of strangers? Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch, does Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna shame you _thus_ before people?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna,\xe2\x80\x9d--muttered Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch,--\xe2\x80\x9cis a very worthy\r\nlady; only, on the score of manners....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, come along, come along!\xe2\x80\x9d--Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna interrupted him,\r\nand entered the drawing-room.\r\n\r\nAll followed her. She tossed off her hat and seated herself at the\r\npiano. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna stood near the wall, a good way from Nad\xc3\xa9zhda\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9evna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the latter, after reflecting a little,--\xe2\x80\x9csing us \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nfarm-hand is sowing the grain.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d[18]\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna began to sing. Her voice was pure and powerful, and she\r\nsang well--simply, and without affectation. All listened to her with\r\ngreat attention, while Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch could not conceal his\r\namazement. When M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna had finished, he stepped up to her, and\r\nbegan to assure her that he had not in the least expected....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait, there\xe2\x80\x99s something more coming!\xe2\x80\x9d--Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna interrupted\r\nhim.--\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1sha, I will soothe thy Topknot[19] soul:--Now sing us \xe2\x80\x98Humming,\r\nhumming in the trees.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you a Little Russian?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am a native of Little Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, and began to sing\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHumming, humming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first she uttered the words in an indifferent manner; but the\r\nmournfully passionate lay of her fatherland gradually began to stir her,\r\nher cheeks flushed scarlet, her glance flashed, her voice rang out\r\nfervently. She finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood heavens! How well thou hast sung that!\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna,\r\nbending over the keys.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity that my brother was not here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna instantly dropped her eyes, and laughed with her\r\ncustomary bitter little laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must give us something more,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Ip\xc3\xa1toff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if you will be so good,\xe2\x80\x9d--added Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, I will not sing any more to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d--said M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, and\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna gazed after her, first reflected, then smiled, began\r\nto pick out \xe2\x80\x9cThe farm-hand is sowing the grain\xe2\x80\x9d with one finger, then\r\nsuddenly began to play a brilliant polka, and without finishing it,\r\nstruck a loud chord, clapped to the lid of the piano, and rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a pity that there is no one to dance with!\xe2\x80\x9d--she exclaimed.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\nwould be just the thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch approached her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a magnificent voice M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna has,\xe2\x80\x9d--he remarked;--\xe2\x80\x9cand with\r\nhow much feeling she sings!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you fond of music?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes ... very.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a learned man, and you are fond of music!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what makes you think that I am learned?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, yes; excuse me, I am always forgetting that you are a positive\r\nman. But where has M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna gone? Wait, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go after her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna fluttered out of the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA giddy-pate, as you see,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff, coming up to Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut the kindest heart. And what an education she received\r\nyou cannot imagine; she can express herself in all languages. Well, they\r\nare wealthy people, so that is comprehensible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d--articulated Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, abstractedly,--\xe2\x80\x9cshe is a very\r\ncharming girl. But permit me to inquire, Was your wife also a native of\r\nLittle Russia?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, she was, sir, My late wife was a Little Russian, as her sister\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna is. My wife, to tell the truth, did not even have a\r\nperfectly pure pronunciation; although she was a perfect mistress of\r\nthe Russian language, still she did not express herself quite correctly;\r\nthey pronounce _i_, _ui_, there, and their _kha_ and _zhe_ are peculiar\r\nalso, you know; well, M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna left her native land in early\r\nchildhood. But the Little Russian blood is still perceptible, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna sings wonderfully,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, it is not bad. But why don\xe2\x80\x99t they bring us some tea? And where\r\nhave the young ladies gone? \xe2\x80\x99Tis time to drink tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young ladies did not return very speedily. In the meantime, the\r\nsamov\xc3\xa1r was brought, the table was laid for tea. Ip\xc3\xa1toff sent for them.\r\nBoth came in together. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna seated herself at the table to\r\npour the tea, while Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna walked to the door opening on\r\nthe terrace, and began to gaze out into the garden. The brilliant summer\r\nday had been succeeded by a clear, calm evening; the sunset was flaming;\r\nthe broad pond, half flooded with its crimson, stood a motionless\r\nmirror, grandly reflecting in its deep bosom all the airy depths of the\r\nsky, and the house, and the trees turned upside down, and had grown\r\nblack, as it were. Everything was silent round about. There was no noise\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook, how beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\r\nas he approached her;--\xe2\x80\x9cdown below there, in the pond, a star has\r\nkindled its fire by the side of the light in the house; the house-light\r\nis red, the other is golden. And yonder comes grandmamma,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added in\r\na loud voice.\r\n\r\nFrom behind a clump of lilac-bushes a small calash made its appearance.\r\nTwo men were drawing it. In it sat an old lady, all wrapped up, all\r\ndoubled over, with her head resting on her breast. The ruffle of her\r\nwhite cap almost completely concealed her withered and contracted little\r\nface. The tiny calash halted in front of the terrace. Ip\xc3\xa1toff emerged\r\nfrom the drawing-room, and his little daughters ran out after him. They\r\nhad been constantly slipping from room to room all the evening, like\r\nlittle mice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you good evening, dear mother,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff, stepping up close\r\nto the old woman, and elevating his voice.--\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to take a look at you,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the old woman in a dull\r\nvoice, and with an effort.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a glorious evening it is. I have been\r\nasleep all day, and now my feet have begun to ache. Okh, those feet of\r\nmine! They don\xe2\x80\x99t serve me, but they ache.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me, dear mother, to present to you our neighbour, Ast\xc3\xa1khoff,\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am very glad to meet you,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned the old woman, scanning him with\r\nher large, black, but dim-sighted eyes.--\xe2\x80\x9cI beg that you will love my\r\nson. He is a fine man; I gave him what education I could; of course, I\r\ndid the best a woman could. He is still somewhat flighty, but, God\r\nwilling, he will grow steady, and \xe2\x80\x99tis high time he did; \xe2\x80\x99tis time for\r\nme to surrender matters to him. Is that you, N\xc3\xa1dya?\xe2\x80\x9d--added the old\r\nwoman, glancing at Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, grandmamma.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is M\xc3\xa1sha pouring tea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, grandmamma, she is pouring tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who else is there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, and Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe husband of Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman mumbled with her lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good. But why is it, M\xc3\xadsha, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t manage to get hold of\r\nthe overseer? Order him to come to me very early to-morrow morning; I\r\nshall have a great deal of business to arrange with him. I see that\r\nnothing goes as it should with you, without me. Come, that will do, I am\r\ntired; take me away.... Farewell, b\xc3\xa1tiushka;[20] I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember your\r\nname and patronymic,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, addressing Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon an old woman. But don\xe2\x80\x99t come with me, grandchildren, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nnecessary. All you care for is to run all the time. M\xc3\xa1sha spoils you.\r\nWell, start on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old woman\xe2\x80\x99s head, which she had raised with difficulty, fell back\r\nagain on her breast....\r\n\r\nThe tiny calash started, and rolled softly away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow old is your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly in her seventy-third year; but it is twenty-six years since her\r\nlegs failed her; that happened soon after the demise of my late father.\r\nBut she used to be a beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll remained silent for a while.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna gave a start. \xe2\x80\x9cWas that--a bat flying\r\npast? \xc3\x81\xc3\xaf, what a fright!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she hastily returned to the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time for me to go home, Mikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1itch; order my horse to be\r\nsaddled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is time for me to be going, too,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going?\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff.--\xe2\x80\x9cSpend the night here. Nad\xc3\xa9zhda\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9evna has only two versts to ride, while you have fully twelve. And\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s your hurry, too, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna? Wait for the moon; it will\r\nsoon be up now. It will be lighter to ride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long time since I had\r\na moonlight ride.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will you spend the night?\xe2\x80\x9d--Ip\xc3\xa1toff asked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.... However, if I do not incommode you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least, I assure you; I will immediately order a chamber to\r\nbe prepared for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is nice to ride by moonlight,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, as\r\nsoon as candles were brought, tea was served, and Ip\xc3\xa1toff and Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch had sat down to play preference together, while The Folding\r\nSoul seated himself silently beside them:--\xe2\x80\x9cespecially through the\r\nforest, between the walnut-trees. It is both terrifying and agreeable,\r\nand what a strange play of light and shade there is--it always seems as\r\nthough some one were stealing up behind you, or in front of you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch smirked condescendingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here\xe2\x80\x99s another thing,\xe2\x80\x9d--she went on;--\xe2\x80\x9chave you ever happened to\r\nsit beside the forest on a warm, dark, tranquil night? At such times it\r\nalways seems to me as though two persons were hotly disputing in an\r\nalmost inaudible whisper, behind me, close at my very ear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the blood beating,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou describe in a very poetical way,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna glanced at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?... In that case, my description would not please\r\nM\xc3\xa1sha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? Is not M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna fond of poetry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she thinks all that sort of thing is made up--is all false; and she\r\ndoes not like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange reproach!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch. \xe2\x80\x9cMade up! How\r\ncould it be otherwise? But, after all, what are composers for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, there, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the point; but I am sure you cannot be fond\r\nof poetry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, I love good verses, when they really are good and\r\nmelodious, and--how shall I say it?--when they present ideas,\r\nthoughts....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna rose.\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna turned swiftly toward her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither art thou going, M\xc3\xa1sha?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo put the children to bed. It is almost nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut cannot they go to bed without thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna took the children by the hand and went away with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is out of sorts to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna;--\xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\nknow why,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added in an undertone.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut it will pass off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to inquire,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhere you intend to\r\nspend the winter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps here, perhaps in Petersburg. It seems to me that I shall be\r\nbored in Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Petersburg! Good gracious! How is that possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch began to describe all the comforts, advantages,\r\nand charm of life in our capital. Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna listened to him\r\nwith attention, never taking her eyes from him. She seemed to be\r\ncommitting his features to memory, and laughed to herself from time to\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you are very eloquent,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said at last.--\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be\r\nobliged to spend the winter in Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will not repent of it,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never repent of anything; it is not worth the bother. If you have\r\nperpetrated a blunder, try to forget it as speedily as possible--that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, after a brief pause, and\r\nin the French language;--\xe2\x80\x9chave you known M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to ask,\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, with a swift\r\nlaugh;--\xe2\x80\x9cwhy you have put precisely that question to me in French?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause ... for no particular reason....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have not known her very long. But she is a remarkable girl, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is very original,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, through his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in your mouth--in the mouth of positive persons--does that\r\nconstitute praise? I do not think so. Perhaps I seem original to you,\r\nalso? But,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, rising from her seat and casting a glance\r\nthrough the window,--\xe2\x80\x9cthe moon must have risen; that is its light on the\r\npoplars. It is time to depart.... I will go and give order that Little\r\nBeauty shall be saddled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is already saddled, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna\xe2\x80\x99s groom,\r\nstepping out from the shadow in the garden into a band of light which\r\nfell on the terrace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s very good, indeed! M\xc3\xa1sha, where art thou? Come and bid\r\nme good-bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna made her appearance from the adjoining room. The men rose\r\nfrom the card-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are going already?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Ip\xc3\xa1toff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am; it is high time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe approached the door leading into the garden.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a night!\xe2\x80\x9d--she exclaimed.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome here; hold out your face to it;\r\ndo you feel how it seems to breathe upon you? And what fragrance! all\r\nthe flowers have waked up now. They have waked up--and we are preparing\r\nto go to sleep.... Ah, by the way, M\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added:--\xe2\x80\x9cI have told\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, you know, that thou art not fond of poetry. And\r\nnow, farewell ... yonder comes my horse....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd she ran briskly down the steps of the terrace, swung herself lightly\r\ninto the saddle, said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye until to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d--and lashing her\r\nhorse on the neck with her riding-switch, she galloped off in the\r\ndirection of the dam.... The groom set off at a trot after her.\r\n\r\nAll gazed after her....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d--her voice rang out once more from behind the\r\npoplars.\r\n\r\nThe hoof-beats were still audible for a long time in the silence of the\r\nsummer night. At last, Ip\xc3\xa1toff proposed that they should go into the\r\nhouse again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really is very nice out of doors,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut we must finish\r\nour game.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll obeyed him. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch began to question M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna as\r\nto why she did not like poetry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerses do not please me,\xe2\x80\x9d--she returned, with apparent reluctance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps you have not read many verses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not read them myself, but I have had them read to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it possible that they did not please you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; none of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s verses?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot even P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna made no answer; but Ip\xc3\xa1toff, twisting round across the\r\nback of his chair, remarked, with a good-natured laugh, that she not\r\nonly did not like verses, but sugar also, and, in general, could not\r\nendure anything sweet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, surely, there are verses which are not sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor example?\xe2\x80\x9d--M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna asked him.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch scratched behind his ear.... He himself knew very\r\nfew verses by heart, especially of the sort which were not sweet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here now,\xe2\x80\x9d--he exclaimed at last;--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you know P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nUpas-Tree\xe2\x80\x99?[21] No? That poem cannot possibly be called sweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecite it,\xe2\x80\x9d--said M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, dropping her eyes.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch first stared at the ceiling, frowned, mumbled\r\nsomething to himself, and at last recited \xe2\x80\x9cThe Upas-Tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter the first four lines, M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna slowly raised her eyes, and\r\nwhen Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch ended, she said, with equal slowness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease recite it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo these verses do please you?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecite it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch repeated \xe2\x80\x9cThe Upas-Tree.\xe2\x80\x9d M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna rose, went\r\nout into the next room, and returned with a sheet of paper, an inkstand\r\nand a pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease write that down for me,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly; with pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d--he replied, beginning to write.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\r\nmust confess that I am puzzled to know why these verses have pleased you\r\nso. I recited them simply to prove to you that not all verses are\r\nsweet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Ip\xc3\xa1toff.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of those verses, Iv\xc3\xa1n\r\n\xc3\x8dlitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, according to his wont, merely glanced at Ip\xc3\xa1toff, but did\r\nnot utter a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,--I have finished,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, as he placed\r\nan interrogation-point at the end of the last line.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna thanked him, and carried the written sheet off to her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later supper was served, and an hour later all the guests\r\ndispersed to their rooms. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch had repeatedly addressed\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna; but it was difficult to conduct a conversation with her,\r\nand his anecdotes did not seem to interest her greatly. He probably\r\nwould have fallen asleep as soon as he got into bed had he not been\r\nhindered by his neighbour, Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch. Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhusband, after he was fully undressed and had got into bed, talked for a\r\nvery long time with his servant, and kept bestowing reprimands on him.\r\nEvery word he uttered was perfectly audible to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch: only\r\na thin partition separated them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold the candle in front of thy breast,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch, in a\r\nquerulous voice;--\xe2\x80\x9chold it so that I can see thy face. Thou hast aged\r\nme, aged me, thou conscienceless man--hast aged me completely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch, how have I aged you?\xe2\x80\x9d--the\r\nservant\xe2\x80\x99s dull and sleepy voice made itself heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell thee how. How many times have I said to thee: \xe2\x80\x98M\xc3\xadtka,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nhave said to thee, \xe2\x80\x98when thou goest a-visiting with me, always take two\r\ngarments of each sort, especially\xe2\x80\x99 ... hold the candle in front of thy\r\nbreast ... \xe2\x80\x98especially underwear.\xe2\x80\x99 And what hast thou done to me\r\nto-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What, sir?\xe2\x80\x99 What am I to put on to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the same things you wore to-day, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast aged me, malefactor, aged me. I was almost beside myself with\r\nthe heat to-day, as it was. Hold the candle in front of thy breast, I\r\ntell thee, and don\xe2\x80\x99t sleep when thy master is talking to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna said, sir, \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Why do you\r\nalways take such a mass of things with you? They only get worn out for\r\nnothing.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna.... Is it a woman\xe2\x80\x99s business, pray, to enter into\r\nthat? You have aged me. Okh, you have made me old before my time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and Yakh\xc3\xadm said the same thing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that thou saidst?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Yakh\xc3\xadm said the same thing, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYakh\xc3\xadm! Yakh\xc3\xadm!\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch, reproachfully.--\xe2\x80\x9cEkh, you\r\nhave aged me, ye accursed, and don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to speak Russian\r\nintelligibly. Yakh\xc3\xadm! Who\xe2\x80\x99s Yakh\xc3\xadm! Efr\xc3\xadm,--well, that might be allowed\r\nto pass, it is permissible to say that; because the genuine Greek name\r\nis Evth\xc3\xadmius, dost understand me?... Hold the candle in front of thy\r\nbreast.... So, for the sake of brevity, thou mayest say Efr\xc3\xadm, if thou\r\nwilt, but not Yakh\xc3\xadm by any manner of means. Y\xc3\xa1khim!\xe2\x80\x9d[22] added Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch, emphasising the syllable _Ya_.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou have aged me, ye\r\nmalefactors. Hold the candle in front of thy breast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd for a long time, Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch continued to berate his servant,\r\nin spite of sighs, coughs, and other tokens of impatience on the part of\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch....\r\n\r\nAt last he dismissed his M\xc3\xadtka, and fell asleep; but Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch\r\nwas no better off for that: Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch snored so mightily and in\r\nso deep a voice, with such playful transitions from high tones to the\r\nvery lowest, with such accompanying whistlings, and even snappings, that\r\nit seemed as though the very partition were shaking in response to him;\r\npoor Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch almost wept. It was very stifling in the\r\nchamber which had been allotted to him, and the feather-bed whereon he\r\nwas lying embraced his whole body in a sort of crawling heat.\r\n\r\nAt last, in despair, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch rose, opened the window, and\r\nbegan with avidity to inhale the nocturnal freshness. The window looked\r\nout on the park. It was light overhead, the round face of the full moon\r\nwas now clearly reflected in the pond, and stretched itself out in a\r\nlong, golden sheaf of slowly transfused spangles. On one of the paths\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch espied a figure in woman\xe2\x80\x99s garb; he looked more\r\nintently; it was M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna; in the moonlight her face seemed pale.\r\nShe stood motionless, and suddenly began to speak.... Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch cautiously put out his head....\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cBut a man--with glance imperious--\r\n     Sent a man to the Upas-tree....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nreached his ear....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d--he thought,--\xe2\x80\x9cthe verses must have taken effect....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd he began to listen with redoubled attention.... But M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna\r\nspeedily fell silent, and turned her face more directly toward him; he\r\ncould distinguish her large, dark eyes, her severe brows and lips....\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she started, wheeled round, entered the shadow cast by a dense\r\nwall of lofty acacias, and disappeared. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch stood for a\r\nconsiderable time at the window, then got into bed again, but did not\r\nfall asleep very soon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA strange being,\xe2\x80\x9d--he thought, as he tossed from side to side;--\xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nyet they say that there is nothing particular in the provinces.... The\r\nidea! A strange being! I shall ask her to-morrow what she was doing in\r\nthe park.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch continued to snore as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOn the following morning Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch awoke quite late, and\r\nimmediately after the general tea and breakfast in the dining-room,\r\ndrove off home to finish his business on his estate, in spite of all old\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to detain him. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna also was present at\r\nthe tea; but Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch did not consider it necessary to\r\nquestion her concerning her late stroll of the night before; he was one\r\nof the people who find it difficult to surrender themselves for two days\r\nin succession to any unusual thoughts and assumptions whatsoever. He\r\nwould have been obliged to discuss verses, and the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cpoetical\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmood wearied him very quickly. He spent the whole day until dinner in\r\nthe fields, ate with great appetite, dozed off, and when he woke up,\r\ntried to take up the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s accounts; but before he had finished the\r\nfirst page, he ordered his tarant\xc3\xa1s to be harnessed, and set off for\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s. Evidently, even positive people do not bear about in their\r\nbreasts hearts of stone, and they are no more fond of being bored than\r\nother plain mortals.\r\n\r\nAs he drove upon the dam he heard voices and the sound of music. They\r\nwere singing Russian ballads in chorus in Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s house. He found the\r\nwhole company which he had left in the morning on the terrace; all,\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna among the rest, were sitting in a circle around a\r\nman of two-and-thirty--a swarthy-skinned, black-eyed, black-haired man\r\nin a velvet jacket, with a scarlet kerchief carelessly knotted about his\r\nneck, and a guitar in his hands. This was Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9evitch V\xc3\xa9retyeff,\r\nbrother of Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna. On catching sight of Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch, old Ip\xc3\xa1toff advanced to meet him with a joyful cry, led him\r\nup to V\xc3\xa9retyeff, and introduced them to each other. After exchanging the\r\ncustomary greetings with his new acquaintance, Ast\xc3\xa1khoff made a\r\nrespectful bow to the latter\xe2\x80\x99s sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re singing songs in country fashion, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\xe2\x80\x9d--began\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff, and pointing to V\xc3\xa9retyeff he added:-\xe2\x80\x9cPi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch is our\r\nleader,--and what a leader! Just you listen to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very pleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill not you join the choir?\xe2\x80\x9d--Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be heartily glad to do so, but I have no voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter! See, Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch is singing, and I\xe2\x80\x99m singing.\r\nAll you have to do is to chime in. Pray, sit down; and do thou strike\r\nup, my dear fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat song shall we sing now?\xe2\x80\x9d--said V\xc3\xa9retyeff, thrumming the guitar;\r\nand suddenly stopping short, he looked at M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, who was\r\nsitting by his side.--\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is your turn now,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; do you sing,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a song now: \xe2\x80\x98Adown dear Mother Volga\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch, with importance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, we will save that up for the last,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied V\xc3\xa9retyeff, and\r\ntinkling the strings of the guitar, he struck up, in slow measure, \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nsun is setting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sang splendidly, dashingly, and blithely. His manly face, already\r\nexpressive, became still more animated when he sang; now and then he\r\nshrugged his shoulders, suddenly pressed the strings with his palm,\r\nraised his arm, shook his curls, and darted a falcon-like look around\r\nhim. More than once in Moscow he had seen the famous Ily\xc3\xa1, and he\r\nimitated him. The chorus chimed in lustily. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\nseparated itself in a melodious flood from the other voices; it seemed\r\nto drag them after it; but she would not sing alone, and V\xc3\xa9retyeff\r\nremained the leader to the end.\r\n\r\nThey sang a great many other songs....\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, along with the evening shadows, a thunder-storm drew\r\non. From noonday it had been steaming hot, and thunder had kept rumbling\r\nin the distance; but now a broad thunder-cloud, which had long lain like\r\na leaden pall on the very rim of the horizon, began to increase and show\r\nitself above the crests of the trees, the stifling air began to quiver\r\nmore distinctly, shaken more and more violently by the approaching\r\nstorm; the wind rose, rustled the foliage abruptly, died into silence,\r\nagain made a prolonged clamour, and began to roar; a surly gloom\r\nflitted over the earth, swiftly dispelling the last reflection of the\r\nsunset glow; dense clouds suddenly floated up, as though rending\r\nthemselves free, and sailed across the sky; a fine rain began to patter\r\ndown, the lightning flashed in a red flame, and the thunder rumbled\r\nheavily and angrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go,\xe2\x80\x9d--said old Ip\xc3\xa1toff,--\xe2\x80\x9cor we shall be drenched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDirectly!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cOne more song, the last.\r\nListen:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAkh, thou house, thou house of mine,\r\n     Thou new house of mine....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nhe struck up in a loud voice, briskly striking the strings of the guitar\r\nwith his whole hand. \xe2\x80\x9cMy new house of maple-wood,\xe2\x80\x9d joined in the chorus,\r\nas though reluctantly carried away. Almost at the same moment, the rain\r\nbegan to beat down in streams; but V\xc3\xa9retyeff sang \xe2\x80\x9cMy house\xe2\x80\x9d to the end.\r\nFrom time to time, drowned by the claps of thunder, the dashing ballad\r\nseemed more dashing than ever beneath the noisy rattle and gurgling of\r\nthe rain. At last the final detonation of the chorus rang out--and the\r\nwhole company ran, laughing, into the drawing-room. Loudest of all\r\nlaughed the little girls, Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, as they shook the\r\nrain-drops from their frocks. But, by way of precaution, Ip\xc3\xa1toff closed\r\nthe window, and locked the door; and Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch lauded him,\r\nremarking that Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna also always gave orders to shut up\r\nwhenever there was a thunder-storm, because electricity is more capable\r\nof acting in an empty space. Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff looked him straight in the face,\r\nstepped aside, and overturned a chair. Such trifling mishaps were\r\nconstantly happening to him.\r\n\r\nThe thunder-storm passed over very soon. The doors and windows were\r\nopened again, and the rooms were filled with moist fragrance. Tea was\r\nbrought. After tea the old men sat down to cards again. Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch\r\njoined them, as usual. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was about to go to M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna, who was sitting at the window with V\xc3\xa9retyeff; but Nad\xc3\xa9zhda\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9evna called him to her, and immediately entered into a fervent\r\ndiscussion with him about Petersburg and Petersburg life. She attacked\r\nit; Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch began to defend it. Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna appeared\r\nto be trying to keep him by her side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you wrangling about?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired V\xc3\xa9retyeff, rising and\r\napproaching them.\r\n\r\nHe swayed lazily from side to side as he walked; in all his movements\r\nthere was perceptible something which was not exactly carelessness, nor\r\nyet exactly fatigue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill about Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.--\xe2\x80\x9cVlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch cannot sufficiently praise it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Tis a fine town,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked V\xc3\xa9retyeff;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut, in my opinion, it is\r\nnice everywhere. By Heaven, it is. If one only has two or three women,\r\nand--pardon my frankness--wine, a man really has nothing left to wish\r\nfor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible\r\nthat you are really of one opinion, that there does not exist for the\r\ncultured man....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps ... in fact ... I agree with you,\xe2\x80\x9d--interrupted V\xc3\xa9retyeff, who,\r\nnotwithstanding all his courtesy, had a habit of not listening to the\r\nend of retorts;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s not in my line; I\xe2\x80\x99m not a philosopher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNeither am I a philosopher,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cand I have\r\nnot the slightest desire to be one; but here it is a question of\r\nsomething entirely different.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff cast an abstracted glance at his sister, and she, with a faint\r\nlaugh, bent toward him, and whispered in a low voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPetr\xc3\xbasha, my dear, imitate Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch for us, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff\xe2\x80\x99s face instantly changed, and, Heaven knows by what miracle,\r\nbecame remarkably like the face of Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch, although the\r\nfeatures of the two faces had absolutely nothing in common, and\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff himself barely wrinkled up his nose and pulled down the\r\ncorners of his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d--he began to whisper, in a voice which was the exact\r\ncounterpart of Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch\xe2\x80\x99s,--\xe2\x80\x9cMatry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna is a severe lady\r\non the score of manners; but, on the other hand, she is a model wife. It\r\nis true that no matter what I may have said....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Biri\xc3\xbaloff girls know it all,\xe2\x80\x9d--put in Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, hardly\r\nrestraining her laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is known on the following day,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied V\xc3\xa9retyeff, with\r\nsuch a comical grimace, with such a perturbed sidelong glance, that even\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see that you possess great talent for mimicry,\xe2\x80\x9d--he remarked.\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff passed his hand over his face, his features resumed their\r\nordinary expression, while Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes! he can mimic any one whom he wishes.... He\xe2\x80\x99s a master hand at\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would you be able to imitate me, for example?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think so!\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna:--\xe2\x80\x9cof course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, pray do me the favour to represent me,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ast\xc3\xa1khoff, turning\r\nto V\xc3\xa9retyeff.--\xe2\x80\x9cI beg that you will not stand on ceremony.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so you too have believed her?\xe2\x80\x9d--replied V\xc3\xa9retyeff, slightly\r\nscrewing up one eye, and imparting to his voice the sound of\r\nAst\xc3\xa1khoff\xe2\x80\x99s voice, but so cautiously and slightly that only Nad\xc3\xa9zhda\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9evna noticed it, and bit her lips.--\xe2\x80\x9cPlease do not believe her;\r\nshe will tell you other untrue things about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you only knew what an actor he is!\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued Nad\xc3\xa9zhda\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9evna:--\xe2\x80\x9che plays every conceivable sort of a part. And so\r\nsplendidly! He is our stage-manager, and our prompter, and everything\r\nyou like. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity that you are going away so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSister, thy partiality blinds thee,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked V\xc3\xa9retyeff, in a pompous\r\ntone, but still with the same touch of Ast\xc3\xa1khoff.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will Mr.\r\nAst\xc3\xa1khoff think of thee?--He will regard thee as a rustic.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was beginning....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee here, Petr\xc3\xbasha,\xe2\x80\x9d--interposed Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna;--\xe2\x80\x9cplease show us\r\nhow a drunken man is utterly unable to get his handkerchief out of his\r\npocket; or no: show us, rather, how a boy catches a fly on the window,\r\nand how it buzzes under his fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a regular child,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied V\xc3\xa9retyeff.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he rose, and stepping to the window, beside which M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna was sitting, he began to pass his hand across the panes, and\r\nrepresent how a small boy catches a fly.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy with which he imitated its pitiful squeak was really\r\namazing. It seemed as though a live fly were actually struggling under\r\nhis fingers. Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna burst out laughing, and gradually every\r\none in the room got to laughing. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s face alone underwent\r\nno change, not even her lips quivered. She sat with downcast eyes, but\r\nraised them at last, and casting a serious glance at V\xc3\xa9retyeff, she\r\nmuttered through her set teeth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat possesses you to make a clown of yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff instantly turned away from the window, and, after standing\r\nstill for a moment in the middle of the room, he went out on the\r\nterrace, and thence into the garden, which had already grown perfectly\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow amusing that Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch is!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch,\r\nslapping down the seven of trumps with a flourish on some one else\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nace.--\xe2\x80\x9cReally, he\xe2\x80\x99s very amusing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna rose, and hastily approaching M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, asked\r\nher in an undertone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat didst thou say to my brother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou mean by \xe2\x80\x98nothing\xe2\x80\x99? Impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd after waiting a little, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna said: \xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d--took\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna by the hand, forced her to rise, and went off with her\r\ninto the garden.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch gazed after the two young girls not without\r\nperplexity. But they were not absent long; a quarter of an hour later\r\nthey returned, and Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch entered the room with them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a splendid night!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, as she\r\nentered.--\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful it is in the garden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, yes. By the way,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9callow me to\r\ninquire, M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, whether it was you whom I saw in the garden\r\nlast night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna gave him a swift look straight in the eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, so far as I could make out, you were declaiming P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The Upas-Tree.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff frowned slightly, and he also began to stare at Ast\xc3\xa1khoff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt really was I,\xe2\x80\x9d--said M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna;--\xe2\x80\x9conly, I was not declaiming\r\nanything; I never declaim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps it seemed so to me,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt did seem so to you?\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, coldly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98The Upas-Tree\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Ast\xc3\xa1khoff.--\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say you\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remember P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s verses: \xe2\x80\x98On the unhealthy, meagre soil\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomehow I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember.... That upas-tree is a poisonous tree, isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike the datura.... Dost remember, M\xc3\xa1sha, how beautiful the datura were\r\non our balcony, in the moonlight, with their long, white blossoms? Dost\r\nremember what fragrance poured from them,--so sweet, insinuating, and\r\ninsidious?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn insidious fragrance!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; insidious. What are you surprised at? They say it is dangerous,\r\nbut it is attractive. Why can evil attract? Evil should not be\r\nbeautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, what theories!\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9chow far away we have\r\ngot from verses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI recited those verses yesterday evening to M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cand they pleased her greatly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, please recite them,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, madam.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Ast\xc3\xa1khoff recited \xe2\x80\x9cThe Upas-Tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo bombastic,\xe2\x80\x9d--ejaculated V\xc3\xa9retyeff, as though against his will, as\r\nsoon as Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch had finished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe poem is too bombastic?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not the poem.... Excuse me, it seems to me that you do not recite\r\nwith sufficient simplicity. The thing speaks for itself; however, I may\r\nbe mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thou art not mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, pausing between\r\nher words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes; that is a matter of course! In thy eyes I am a genius, an\r\nextremely gifted man, who knows everything, can do everything;\r\nunfortunately, he is overcome with laziness; isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna merely shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not quarrel with you; you must know best about that,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, somewhat sulkily.--\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not in my line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made a mistake, pardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d--ejaculated V\xc3\xa9retyeff, hastily.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the game of cards had come to an end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, by the way,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff, as he rose;--\xe2\x80\x9cVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, one\r\nof the local landed proprietors, a neighbour, a very fine and worthy\r\nman, Ak\xc3\xadlin, Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch, has commissioned me to ask you whether\r\nyou will not do him the honour to be present at his ball,--that is, I\r\njust put it so, for beauty of style, and said \xe2\x80\x98ball,\xe2\x80\x99 but it is only an\r\nevening party with dancing, quite informal. He would have called upon\r\nyou himself without fail, only he was afraid of disturbing you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am much obliged to the gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut it is imperatively necessary that I should return\r\nhome....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy--but when do you suppose the ball takes place? \xe2\x80\x99Tis to-morrow.\r\nTo-morrow is Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s Name-day. One day more won\xe2\x80\x99t matter,\r\nand how much pleasure you will give him! And it\xe2\x80\x99s only ten versts from\r\nhere. If you will allow, we will take you thither.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are you\r\ngoing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole family! And Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna and Pi\xc3\xb3tr\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9itch,--everybody is going!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may invite me on the spot for the fifth quadrille, if you\r\nlike,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.--\xe2\x80\x9cThe first four are already\r\nbespoken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are very kind; and are you already engaged for the mazurka?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Let me think ... no, I think I am not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, if you will be so kind, I should like to have the\r\nhonour....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat means that you will go? Very good. Certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Ip\xc3\xa1toff.--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, you have put\r\nus under an obligation. Gavr\xc3\xadlo Step\xc3\xa1nitch will simply go into\r\nraptures. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that so, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch would have preferred to hold his peace, according to his\r\nwont, but thought it better to utter a sound of approval.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat possessed thee,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch an hour later to his\r\nsister, as he sat with her in a light two-wheeled cart, which he was\r\ndriving himself,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat possessed thee to saddle thyself with that\r\nsour-visaged fellow for the mazurka?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have reasons of my own for that,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat reasons?--permit me to inquire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOho!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with his whip he lightly flicked the horse, which was beginning to\r\nprick up its ears, snort, and shy. It was frightened by the shadow of a\r\nhuge willow bush which fell across the road, dimly illuminated by the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shalt thou dance with M\xc3\xa1sha?\xe2\x80\x9d--Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, in her turn,\r\nquestioned her brother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said indifferently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, reproachfully.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nmen,\xe2\x80\x9d--she added, after a brief pause,--\xe2\x80\x9cpositively do not deserve to be\r\nloved by nice women.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDost think so? Well, and that sour-visaged Petersburger--does he\r\ndeserve it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSooner than thou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch recited, with a sigh:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a mission, O Creator,\r\n     To be ... the brother of a grown-up sister!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cause thee a great deal of trouble, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that. I have a\r\ncommission to thee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?--I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t the slightest suspicion of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of M\xc3\xa1sha.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn what score?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna\xe2\x80\x99s face assumed a slight expression of pain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou knowest thyself,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said softly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, I understand!--What\xe2\x80\x99s to be done, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, ma\xe2\x80\x99am? I\r\nlove to drink with a good friend, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, sinful man that I am; I love\r\nit, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, brother, please don\xe2\x80\x99t talk like that!... This is no jesting\r\nmatter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTram-tram-tam-poom!\xe2\x80\x9d--muttered Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch through his teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is thy perdition, and thou jestest....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cThe farm-hand is sowing the grain, his wife does not agree....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nstruck up Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch loudly, slapped the horse with the reins, and\r\nit dashed onward at a brisk trot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOn reaching home V\xc3\xa9retyeff did not undress, and a couple of hours later,\r\nwhen the flush of dawn was just colouring the sky, he was no longer in\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nHalf-way between his estate and Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s, on the very brink of a broad\r\nravine, stood a small birch grove. The young trees grew very close\r\ntogether, and no axe had yet touched their graceful trunks; a shadow\r\nwhich was not dense, but continuous, spread from the tiny leaves on the\r\nsoft, thin grass, all mottled with the golden heads of buttercups,[23]\r\nthe white dots of wood-campanula, and the tiny deep-crimson crosses of\r\nwild pinks. The recently-risen sun flooded the whole grove with a\r\npowerful though not brilliant light; dewdrops glittered everywhere,\r\nwhile here and there large drops kindled and glowed red; everything\r\nexhaled freshness, life, and that innocent triumph of the first moments\r\nof the morning, when everything is still so bright and still so silent.\r\nThe only thing audible was the carolling voices of the larks above the\r\ndistant fields, and in the grove itself two or three small birds were\r\nexecuting, in a leisurely manner, their brief songs, and then,\r\napparently, listening to see how their performance had turned out. From\r\nthe damp earth arose a strong, healthy scent; a pure, light breeze\r\nfluttered all about in cool gusts. Morning, glorious morning, breathed\r\nforth from everything--everything looked and smiled of the morning, like\r\nthe rosy, freshly-washed face of a baby who has just waked up.\r\n\r\nNot far from the ravine, in the middle of a small glade, on an outspread\r\ncloak, sat V\xc3\xa9retyeff. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna was standing beside him, leaning\r\nagainst a birch-tree, with her hands clasped behind her.\r\n\r\nBoth were silent. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna was gazing fixedly into the far\r\ndistance; a white scarf had slipped from her head to her shoulders, the\r\nerrant breeze was stirring and lifting the ends of her hastily-knotted\r\nhair. V\xc3\xa9retyeff sat bent over, tapping the grass with a small branch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d--he began at last,--\xe2\x80\x9care you angry with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna made no reply.\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff darted a glance at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1sha, are you angry?\xe2\x80\x9d--he repeated.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna scanned him with a swift glance from head to foot turned\r\nslightly away, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked V\xc3\xa9retyeff, and flung away his branch.\r\n\r\nAgain M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna made no reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, as a matter of fact, you have a right to be angry with me,\xe2\x80\x9d--began\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff, after a brief pause.--\xe2\x80\x9cYou must regard me as a man who is not\r\nonly frivolous, but even....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not understand me,\xe2\x80\x9d--interrupted M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.--\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in\r\nthe least angry with you on my own account.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn whose account, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff raised his head and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d--he said.--\xe2\x80\x9cAgain! again the thought is beginning to\r\nagitate you: \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I make something of myself?\xe2\x80\x99 Do you know what,\r\nM\xc3\xa1sha, you are a wonderful being; by Heaven, you are! You worry so much\r\nabout other people and so little about yourself. There is not a bit of\r\negoism in you; really, really there isn\xe2\x80\x99t. There\xe2\x80\x99s no other girl in the\r\nworld like you. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity about one thing: I decidedly am not worthy\r\nof your affection; I say that without jesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the worse for you. You feel and do nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d--Again V\xc3\xa9retyeff\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1sha, take your hand from behind your back, and give it to me,\xe2\x80\x9d--he\r\nsaid, with insinuating affection in his voice.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna merely shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive me your beautiful, honest hand; I want to kiss it respectfully and\r\ntenderly. Thus does a giddy-pated scholar kiss the hand of his\r\ncondescending tutor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd V\xc3\xa9retyeff reached out toward M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of that!\xe2\x80\x9d--said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are always laughing and jesting, and\r\nyou will jest away your life like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! jest away my life! A new expression! But I hope, M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna,\r\nthat you used the verb \xe2\x80\x98to jest\xe2\x80\x99 in the active sense?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna contracted her brows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of that, V\xc3\xa9retyeff,\xe2\x80\x9d--she repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo jest away life,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on V\xc3\xa9retyeff, half rising;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut you are\r\nimagining me as worse than I am; you are wasting your life in\r\nseriousness. Do you know, M\xc3\xa1sha, you remind me of a scene from P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don Juan.\xe2\x80\x99 You have not read P\xc3\xbashkin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Don Juan\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I had forgotten, you see, that you do not read verses.--In that\r\npoem guests come to a certain Laura; she drives them all away and\r\nremains alone with Carlos. The two go out on the balcony; the night is\r\nwonderful. Laura admires, and Carlos suddenly begins to demonstrate to\r\nher that she will grow old in course of time.--\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 replies Laura,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it may be cold and rainy in Paris now, but here, with us, \xe2\x80\x9cthe night is\r\nredolent of orange and of laurel.\xe2\x80\x9d Why make guesses at the future?\xe2\x80\x99 Look\r\naround you, M\xc3\xa1sha; is it not beautiful here? See how everything is\r\nenjoying life, how young everything is. And aren\xe2\x80\x99t we young ourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff approached M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna; she did not move away from him, but\r\nshe did not turn her head toward him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSmile, M\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d--he went on;--\xe2\x80\x9conly with your kind smile, not with your\r\nusual grin. I love your kind smile. Raise your proud, stern eyes.--What\r\nails you? You turn away. Stretch out your hand to me, at least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, V\xc3\xa9retyeff,\xe2\x80\x9d--began M\xc3\xa1sha;--\xe2\x80\x9cyou know that I do not understand how\r\nto express myself. You have told me about that Laura. But she was a\r\nwoman, you see.... A woman may be pardoned for not thinking of the\r\nfuture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you speak, M\xc3\xa1sha,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned V\xc3\xa9retyeff,--\xe2\x80\x9cyou blush incessantly\r\nwith self-love and modesty: the blood fairly flows in a crimson flood\r\ninto your cheeks. I\xe2\x80\x99m awfully fond of that in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna looked V\xc3\xa9retyeff straight in the eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said, and threw her scarf over her head.\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff held her back. \xe2\x80\x9cEnough, enough. Stay!\xe2\x80\x9d--he cried.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome, why\r\nare you going? Issue your commands! Do you want me to enter the service,\r\nto become an agriculturist? Do you want me to publish romances with\r\naccompaniment for the guitar; to print a collection of poems, or of\r\ndrawings; to busy myself with painting, sculpture, dancing on the rope?\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything, anything, anything you command, if only you will be\r\nsatisfied with me! Come, really now, M\xc3\xa1sha, believe me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will do all that in words only, not in deeds. You declare that you\r\nwill obey me....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou obey, but how many times have I begged you....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna hesitated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to drink liquor,\xe2\x80\x9d--she said at last.\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEkh, M\xc3\xa1sha! And you are at it, too! My sister is worrying herself to\r\ndeath over that also. But, in the first place, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a drunkard at\r\nall; and in the second place, do you know why I drink? Look yonder, at\r\nthat swallow.... Do you see how boldly it manages its tiny body,--and\r\nhurls it wherever it wishes? Now it has soared aloft, now it has darted\r\ndownward. It has even piped with joy: do you hear? So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\r\ndrink, M\xc3\xa1sha, in order to feel those same sensations which that swallow\r\nexperiences.... Hurl yourself whithersoever you will, soar wheresoever\r\nyou take a fancy....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to what end?\xe2\x80\x9d--interrupted M\xc3\xa1sha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that? What is one to live on then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible to get along without liquor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it is not; we are all damaged, rumpled. There\xe2\x80\x99s passion ... it\r\nproduces the same effect. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike wine.... I\xe2\x80\x99m much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, M\xc3\xa1sha, I do not love you like wine. Stay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll prove it to you\r\nsometime,--when we are married, say, and go abroad together. Do you\r\nknow, I am planning in advance how I shall lead you in front of the\r\nVenus of Milo. At this point it will be appropriate to say:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when she stands with serious eyes\r\n     Before the Chyprian of Milos--\r\n     Twain are they, and the marble in comparison\r\n     Suffers, it would seem, affront....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat makes me talk constantly in poetry to-day? It must be that this\r\nmorning is affecting me. What air! \xe2\x80\x99Tis exactly as though one were\r\nquaffing wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWine again,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat of that! A morning like this, and you with me, and not feel\r\nintoxicated! \xe2\x80\x98With serious eyes....\xe2\x80\x99 Yes,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued V\xc3\xa9retyeff, gazing\r\nintently at M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat is so.... For I remember, I have\r\nbeheld, rarely, but yet I have beheld these dark, magnificent eyes, I\r\nhave beheld them tender! And how beautiful they are then! Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nturn away, M\xc3\xa1sha; pray, smile at least ... show me your eyes merry, at\r\nall events, if they will not vouchsafe me a tender glance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, V\xc3\xa9retyeff,\xe2\x80\x9d--said M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.--\xe2\x80\x9cRelease me! It is time for me\r\nto go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make you laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d--interposed V\xc3\xa9retyeff; \xe2\x80\x9cby Heaven, I\r\nwill make you laugh. Eh, by the way, yonder runs a hare....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder, beyond the ravine, across the field of oats. Some one must have\r\nstartled it; they don\xe2\x80\x99t run in the morning. I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop it on the instant,\r\nif you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd V\xc3\xa9retyeff whistled loudly. The hare immediately squatted, twitched\r\nits ears, drew up its fore paws, straightened itself up, munched,\r\nsniffed the air, and again began to munch with its lips. V\xc3\xa9retyeff\r\npromptly squatted down on his heels, like the hare, and began to twitch\r\nhis nose, sniff, and munch like it. The hare passed its paws twice\r\nacross its muzzle and shook itself,--they must have been wet with\r\ndew,--stiffened its ears, and bounded onward. V\xc3\xa9retyeff rubbed his hands\r\nover his cheeks and shook himself also.... M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna could not\r\nhold out, and burst into a laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBravo!\xe2\x80\x9d--cried V\xc3\xa9retyeff, springing up. \xe2\x80\x9cBravo! That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the\r\npoint--you are not a coquette. Do you know, if any fashionable young\r\nlady had such teeth as you have she would laugh incessantly. But that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprecisely why I love you, M\xc3\xa1sha, because you are not a fashionable young\r\nlady, don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh without cause, and don\xe2\x80\x99t wear gloves on your hands,\r\nwhich it is a joy to kiss, because they are sunburned, and one feels\r\ntheir strength.... I love you, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t argue, because you are\r\nproud, taciturn, don\xe2\x80\x99t read books, don\xe2\x80\x99t love poetry....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll recite some verses to you, shall I?\xe2\x80\x9d--M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna interrupted\r\nhim, with a certain peculiar expression on her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVerses?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired V\xc3\xa9retyeff, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, verses; the very ones which that Petersburg gentleman recited last\r\nnight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Upas-Tree\xe2\x80\x99 again?... So you really were declaiming in the garden,\r\nby night? That\xe2\x80\x99s just like you.... But does it really please you so\r\nmuch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it does.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecite it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna was seized with shyness....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecite it, recite it,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated V\xc3\xa9retyeff.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna began to recite; V\xc3\xa9retyeff stood in front of her, with\r\nhis arms folded on his breast, and bent himself to listen. At the first\r\nline M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna raised her eyes heavenward; she did not wish to\r\nencounter V\xc3\xa9retyeff\xe2\x80\x99s gaze. She recited in her even, soft voice, which\r\nreminded one of the sound of a violoncello; but when she reached the\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the poor slave expired at the feet\r\n     Of his invincible sovereign....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nher voice began to quiver, her impassive, haughty brows rose\r\ningenuously, like those of a little girl, and her eyes, with involuntary\r\ndevotion, fixed themselves on V\xc3\xa9retyeff....\r\n\r\nHe suddenly threw himself at her feet and embraced her knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am thy slave!\xe2\x80\x9d--he cried.--\xe2\x80\x9cI am at thy feet, thou art my sovereign,\r\nmy goddess, my ox-eyed Hera, my Medea....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna attempted to repulse him, but her hands sank helplessly\r\nin his thick curls, and, with a smile of confusion, she dropped her head\r\non her breast....\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch Ak\xc3\xadlin, at whose house the ball was appointed,\r\nbelonged to the category of landed proprietors who evoked the\r\nadmiration of the neighbours by their ingenuity in living well on very\r\ninsignificant means. Although he did not own more than four hundred\r\nserfs, he was in the habit of entertaining the whole government in a\r\nhuge stone mansion, with a tower and a flag on the tower, erected by\r\nhimself. The property had descended to him from his father, and had\r\nnever been distinguished for being well ordered; Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch had\r\nbeen an absentee for a long time--had been in the service in Petersburg.\r\nAt last, twenty-five years before the date of our story, he returned to\r\nhis native place, with the rank of Collegiate Assessor,[24] and, with a\r\nwife and three daughters, had simultaneously undertaken reorganisation\r\nand building operations, had gradually set up an orchestra, and had\r\nbegun to give dinners. At first everybody had prophesied for him speedy\r\nand inevitable ruin; more than once rumours had become current to the\r\neffect that Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s estate was to be sold under the hammer;\r\nbut the years passed, dinners, balls, banquets, concerts, followed each\r\nother in their customary order, new buildings sprang out of the earth\r\nlike mushrooms, and still Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s estate was not sold under\r\nthe hammer, and he himself continued to live as before, and had even\r\ngrown stout of late.\r\n\r\nThen the neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 gossip took another direction; they began to hint\r\nat certain vast sums which were said to be concealed; they talked of a\r\ntreasure.... \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he were only a good farmer, ...\xe2\x80\x9d so argued the\r\nnobles among themselves; \xe2\x80\x9cbut that\xe2\x80\x99s just what he isn\xe2\x80\x99t, you know! Not\r\nat all! So it is deserving of surprise, and incomprehensible.\xe2\x80\x9d However\r\nthat may have been, every one went very gladly to Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse. He received his guests cordially, and played cards for any stake\r\nthey liked. He was a grey-haired little man, with a small, pointed head,\r\na yellow face, and yellow eyes, always carefully shaven and perfumed\r\nwith eau-de-cologne; both on ordinary days and on holidays he wore a\r\nroomy blue dress-coat, buttoned to the chin, a large stock, in which he\r\nhad a habit of hiding his chin, and he was foppishly fastidious about\r\nhis linen; he screwed up his eyes and thrust out his lips when he took\r\nsnuff, and spoke very politely and softly, incessantly employing the\r\nletter _s_.[25]\r\n\r\nIn appearance, Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch was not distinguished by vivacity,\r\nand, in general, his exterior was not prepossessing, and he did not look\r\nlike a clever man, although, at times, craft gleamed in his eye. He had\r\nsettled his two elder daughters advantageously; the youngest was still\r\nat home, and of marriageable age. Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch also had a wife, an\r\ninsignificant and wordless being.\r\n\r\nAt seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch presented himself\r\nat the Ip\xc3\xa1toffs\xe2\x80\x99 in dress-suit and white gloves. He found them all\r\nentirely dressed; the little girls were sitting sedately, afraid of\r\nmussing their starched white frocks; old Ip\xc3\xa1toff, on catching sight of\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch in his dress-suit, affectionately upbraided him, and\r\npointed to his own frock-coat; M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna wore a muslin gown of a\r\ndeep rose colour, which was extremely becoming to her. Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch paid her several compliments. M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s beauty\r\nattracted him, although she was evidently shy of him; he also liked\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, but her free-and-easy manners somewhat disconcerted\r\nhim. Moreover, in her remarks, her looks, her very smiles, mockery\r\nfrequently peeped forth, and this disturbed his citified and well-bred\r\nsoul. He would not have been averse to making fun of others with her,\r\nbut it was unpleasant to him to think that she was probably capable of\r\njeering at himself.\r\n\r\nThe ball had already begun; a good many guests had assembled, and the\r\nhome-bred orchestra was crashing and booming and screeching in the\r\ngallery, when the Ip\xc3\xa1toff family, accompanied by Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\r\nentered the hall of the Ak\xc3\xadlin house. The host met them at the very\r\ndoor, thanked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch for his tender procuration of an\r\nagreeable surprise,--that was the way he expressed himself,--and, taking\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s arm, he led him to the drawing-room, to the card-tables.\r\nGavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch had received a bad education, and everything in his\r\nhouse, both the music and the furniture and the food and the wines, not\r\nonly could not be called first-class, but were not even fit to be ranked\r\nas second-class. On the other hand, there was plenty of everything, and\r\nhe himself did not put on airs, was not arrogant ... the nobles demanded\r\nnothing more from him, and were entirely satisfied with his\r\nentertainment. At supper, for instance, the caviare was served cut up in\r\nchunks and heavily salted; but no one objected to your taking it in your\r\nfingers, and there was plenty wherewith to wash it down: wines which\r\nwere cheap, it is true, but were made from grapes, nevertheless, and not\r\nsome other concoction. The springs in Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s furniture\r\nwere rather uncomfortable, owing to their stiffness and inflexibility;\r\nbut, not to mention the fact that there were no springs whatever in many\r\nof the couches and easy-chairs, any one could place under him a worsted\r\ncushion, and there was a great number of such cushions lying about,\r\nembroidered by the hands of Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s spouse herself--and\r\nthen there was nothing left to desire.\r\n\r\nIn a word, Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s house could not possibly have been\r\nbetter adapted to the sociable and unceremonious style of ideas of the\r\ninhabitants of *** county, and it was solely owing to Mr. Ak\xc3\xadlin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmodesty that at the assemblies of the nobility he was not elected\r\nMarshal, but a retired Major Podp\xc3\xa9kin, a greatly respected and worthy\r\nman, despite the fact that he brushed his hair over to the right temple\r\nfrom the left ear, dyed his moustache a lilac hue, and as he suffered\r\nfrom asthma, had of late fallen into melancholy.\r\n\r\nSo, then, the ball had already begun. They were dancing a quadrille of\r\nten pairs. The cavaliers were the officers of a regiment stationed close\r\nby, and divers not very youthful squires, and two or three officials\r\nfrom the town. Everything was as it should be, everything was proceeding\r\nin due order. The Marshal of the Nobility was playing cards with a\r\nretired Actual Councillor of State,[26] and a wealthy gentleman, the\r\nowner of three thousand souls. The actual state councillor wore on his\r\nforefinger a ring with a diamond, talked very softly, kept the heels of\r\nhis boots closely united, and did not move them from the position used\r\nby dancers of former days, and did not turn his head, which was half\r\nconcealed by a capital velvet collar. The wealthy gentleman, on the\r\ncontrary, was constantly laughing at something or other, elevating his\r\neyebrows, and flashing the whites of his eyes. The poet Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff, a\r\nman of shy and clumsy aspect, was chatting in a corner with the learned\r\nhistorian Evsiuk\xc3\xb3ff: each had clutched the other by the button. Beside\r\nthem, one noble, with a remarkably long waist, was expounding certain\r\naudacious opinions to another noble who was timidly staring at his\r\nforehead. Along the wall sat the mammas in gay-hued caps; around the\r\ndoors pressed the men of simple cut, young fellows with perturbed faces,\r\nand elderly fellows with peaceable ones; but one cannot describe\r\neverything. We repeat: everything was as it should be.\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna had arrived even earlier than the Ip\xc3\xa1toffs; Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch saw her dancing with a young man of handsome appearance in a\r\ndandified dress-suit, with expressive eyes, thin black moustache, and\r\ngleaming teeth; a gold chain hung in a semicircle on his stomach.\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna wore a light-blue gown with white flowers; a small\r\ngarland of the same flowers encircled her curly head; she was smiling,\r\nfluttering her fan, and gaily gazing about her; she felt that she was\r\nthe queen of the ball. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch approached her, made his\r\nobeisance, and looking her pleasantly in the face, he asked her whether\r\nshe remembered her promise of the day before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat promise?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, that you would dance the mazurka with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course I will dance it with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe young man who stood alongside Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna suddenly flushed\r\ncrimson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have probably forgotten, mademoiselle,\xe2\x80\x9d--he began,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat you had\r\nalready previously promised to-day\xe2\x80\x99s mazurka to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna became confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh! good heavens, what am I to do?\xe2\x80\x9d--she said:--\xe2\x80\x9cexcuse me, pray,\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieu Steltch\xc3\xadnsky, I am so absent-minded; I really am ashamed....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99sieu Steltch\xc3\xadnsky made no reply, and merely dropped his eyes; Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch assumed a slight air of dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe so good, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Steltch\xc3\xadnsky,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nand I are old acquaintances, but M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Ast\xc3\xa1khoff is a stranger among\r\nus; do not place me in an awkward position: permit me to dance with\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you please,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned the young man.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut you must begin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThanks,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, and fluttered off to meet her\r\nvis-\xc3\xa0-vis.\r\n\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky followed her with his eyes, then looked at Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, in his turn, looked at him, then\r\nstepped aside.\r\n\r\nThe quadrille soon came to an end. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch strolled about\r\nthe hall a little, then he betook himself to the drawing-room and\r\npaused at one of the card-tables. Suddenly he felt some one touch his\r\nhand from behind; he turned round--before him stood Steltch\xc3\xadnsky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have a couple of words with you in the next room, if you will\r\npermit,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the latter, in French, very courteously, and with an\r\naccent which was not Russian.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch followed him.\r\n\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky halted at a window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the presence of ladies,\xe2\x80\x9d--he began, in the same language as\r\nbefore,--\xe2\x80\x9cI could not say anything else than what I did say; but I hope\r\nyou do not think that I really intend to surrender to you my right to\r\nthe mazurka with M-lle V\xc3\xa9retyeff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was astounded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d--he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Steltch\xc3\xadnsky, quietly, laying his hand on his\r\nbreast and inflating his nostrils,--\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to,--that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch also laid his hand on his breast, but did not\r\ninflate his nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me to remark to you, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--he began,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat by this\r\ncourse you may drag M-lle V\xc3\xa9retyeff into unpleasantness, and I\r\nassume....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be extremely unpleasant to me, but no one can prevent your\r\ndeclining, declaring that you are ill, or going away....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not do it. For whom do you take me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case, I shall be compelled to demand satisfaction from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn what sense do you mean ... satisfaction?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe sense is evident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will challenge me to a duel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely so, sir, if you do not renounce the mazurka.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky endeavoured to utter these words as negligently as\r\npossible. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s heart set to beating violently. He\r\nlooked his wholly unexpected antagonist in the face. \xe2\x80\x9cPhew, O Lord, what\r\nstupidity!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not jesting?\xe2\x80\x9d--he articulated aloud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the habit of jesting in general,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Steltch\xc3\xadnsky,\r\npompously;--\xe2\x80\x9cand particularly with people whom I do not know. You will\r\nnot renounce the mazurka?\xe2\x80\x9d--he added, after a brief pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not,\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, as though deliberating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good! We will fight to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow morning my second will call upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd with a courteous inclination, Steltch\xc3\xadnsky withdrew, evidently well\r\npleased with himself.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch remained a few minutes longer by the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust look at that, now!\xe2\x80\x9d--he thought.--\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the result of thy new\r\nacquaintances! What possessed me to come? Good! Splendid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut at last he recovered himself, and went out into the hall.\r\n\r\nIn the hall they were already dancing the polka. Before Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s eyes M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna flitted past with Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch,\r\nwhom he had not noticed up to that moment; she seemed pale, and even\r\nsad; then Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna darted past, all beaming and joyous, with\r\nsome youthful, bow-legged, but fiery artillery officer; on the second\r\nround, she was dancing with Steltch\xc3\xadnsky. Steltch\xc3\xadnsky shook his hair\r\nviolently when he danced.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d--suddenly rang out Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s back;--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re only looking on, but not dancing\r\nyourself? Come, confess that, in spite of the fact that we live in a\r\ndead-calm region, so to speak, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t badly off, are we, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood! damn the dead-calm region!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, and\r\nmumbling something in reply to Ip\xc3\xa1toff, he went off to another corner of\r\nthe hall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must hunt up a second,\xe2\x80\x9d--he pursued his meditations;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut where the\r\ndevil am I to find one? I can\xe2\x80\x99t take V\xc3\xa9retyeff; I know no others; the\r\ndevil only knows what a stupid affair this is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, when he got angry, was fond of mentioning the\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s eyes fell upon The Folding Soul,\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, standing idly by the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he do?\xe2\x80\x9d--he thought, and shrugging his shoulders, he added\r\nalmost aloud:--\xe2\x80\x9cI shall have to take him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch stepped up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA very strange thing has just happened to me,\xe2\x80\x9d--began our hero with a\r\nforced smile:--\xe2\x80\x9cjust imagine some young man or other, a stranger to me,\r\nhas challenged me to a duel; it is utterly impossible for me to refuse;\r\nI am in indispensable need of a second: will not you act?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch was characterised, as we know, by imperturbable\r\nindifference, yet such an unexpected proposition startled even him.\r\nThoroughly perplexed, he riveted his eyes on Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cI should be greatly indebted to\r\nyou. I am not acquainted with any one here. You alone....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, as though just waking up;--\xe2\x80\x9cI absolutely\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? You are afraid of unpleasantness; but all this will, I hope,\r\nremain a secret....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these words, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch felt himself blushing and\r\ngrowing confused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, I can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, shaking his head\r\nand drawing back, in which operation he again overturned a chair.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in his life it was his lot to reply to a request by a\r\nrefusal; but then, the request was such a queer one!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, in an agitated voice, as he\r\ngrasped his hand,--\xe2\x80\x9cdo me the favour not to speak to any one concerning\r\nwhat I have said to you. I earnestly entreat this of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can do that, I can do that,\xe2\x80\x9d--hastily replied Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut the\r\nother thing I cannot do, say what you will; I positively am unable to do\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, very good, very good,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch;--\xe2\x80\x9cbut do not\r\nforget that I rely on your discretion.... I shall announce to-morrow to\r\nthat gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered to himself with vexation,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat I could\r\nnot find a second, so let him make what arrangements he sees fit, for I\r\nam a stranger here. And the devil prompted me to apply to that\r\ngentleman! But what else was there for me to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was very, very unlike his usual self.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the ball went on. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch would have\r\ngreatly liked to depart at once, but departure was not to be thought of\r\nuntil the end of the mazurka. How was he to give up to his delighted\r\nantagonist? Unhappily for Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, the dances were in charge\r\nof a free-and-easy young gentleman with long hair and a sunken chest,\r\nover which, in semblance of a miniature waterfall, meandered a black\r\nsatin neckcloth, transfixed with a huge gold pin. This young gentleman\r\nhad the reputation, throughout the entire government, of being a man who\r\nhad assimilated, in their most delicate details, all the customs and\r\nrules of the highest society, although he had lived in Petersburg only\r\nsix months altogether, and had not succeeded in penetrating any loftier\r\nheights than the houses of Collegiate Assessor Sandar\xc3\xa1ki and his\r\nbrother-in-law, State Councillor Kostandar\xc3\xa1ki. He superintended the\r\ndances at all balls, gave the signal to the musicians by clapping his\r\nhands, and in the midst of the roar of the trumpets and the squeaking of\r\nthe violins shouted: \xe2\x80\x9c_En avant deux!_\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c_Grande cha\xc3\xaene!_\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c_A\r\nvous, mademoiselle!_\xe2\x80\x9d and was incessantly flying, all pale and\r\nperspiring, through the hall, slipping headlong, and bowing and\r\nscraping. He never began the mazurka before midnight. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that is a\r\nconcession,\xe2\x80\x9d--he was wont to say;--\xe2\x80\x9cin Petersburg I would keep you in\r\ntorment until two o\xe2\x80\x99clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis ball seemed very long to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch. He prowled about\r\nlike a shadow from hall to drawing-room, now and again exchanging cold\r\nglances with his antagonist, who never missed a single dance, and\r\nundertook to invite M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna for a quadrille, but she was already\r\nengaged--and a couple of times he bandied words with the anxious host,\r\nwho appeared to be harassed by the tedium which was written on the\r\ncountenance of the new guest. At last, the music of the longed-for\r\nmazurka thundered out. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch hunted up his lady, brought\r\ntwo chairs, and seated himself with her, near the end of the circle,\r\nalmost opposite Steltch\xc3\xadnsky.\r\n\r\nThe young man who managed affairs was in the first pair, as might have\r\nbeen expected. With what a face he began the mazurka, how he dragged his\r\nlady after him, how he beat the floor with his foot, and twitched his\r\nhead the while,--all this is almost beyond the power of human pen to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it seems to me, M\xe2\x80\x99sieu Ast\xc3\xa1khoff, that you are bored,\xe2\x80\x9d--began\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, suddenly turning to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI? Not in the least. What makes you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, because I do from the expression of your face.... You have never\r\nsmiled a single time since you arrived. I had not expected that of you.\r\nIt is not becoming to you positive gentlemen to be misanthropical and\r\nto frown \xc3\xa0 la Byron. Leave that to the authors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI notice, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, that you frequently call me a positive\r\nman, as though mockingly. It must be that you regard me as the coldest\r\nand most sensible of beings, incapable of anything which.... But do you\r\nknow, I will tell you something; a positive man is often very sad at\r\nheart, but he does not consider it necessary to display to others what\r\nis going on there inside of him; he prefers to hold his peace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean by that?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, surveying him\r\nwith a glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, with feigned\r\nindifference, assuming an air of mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally, nothing.... You shall know some day, later on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna wanted to pursue her questions, but at that moment a\r\nyoung girl, the host\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, led up to her Steltch\xc3\xadnsky and another\r\ncavalier in blue spectacles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife or death?\xe2\x80\x9d--she asked in French.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLife,\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want death just yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky bowed; she went off with him.[27]\r\n\r\nThe cavalier in the blue glasses, who was called Death, started off with\r\nthe host\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. Steltch\xc3\xadnsky had invented the two designations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me, please, who is that Mr. Steltch\xc3\xadnsky?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch of Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, as soon as the latter returned to her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is attached to the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s service, and is a very agreeable man.\r\nHe does not belong in these parts. He is somewhat of a coxcomb, but that\r\nruns in the blood of all of them. I hope you have not had any\r\nexplanations with him on account of the mazurka?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone whatever, I assure you,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, with a\r\nlittle hesitation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m such a forgetful creature! You can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am bound to be delighted with your forgetfulness: it has afforded me\r\nthe pleasure of dancing with you to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna gazed at him, with her eyes slightly narrowed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally? You find it agreeable to dance with me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch answered her with a compliment. Little by little he\r\ngot to talking freely. Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna was always charming, and\r\nparticularly so that evening; Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch thought her\r\nenchanting. The thought of the duel on the morrow, while it fretted his\r\nnerves, imparted brilliancy and vivacity to his remarks; under its\r\ninfluence he permitted himself slight exaggerations in the expression of\r\nhis feelings.... \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care!\xe2\x80\x9d he thought. Something mysterious,\r\ninvoluntarily sad, something elegantly-hopeless peeped forth in all his\r\nwords, in his suppressed sighs, in his glances which suddenly darkened.\r\nAt last, he got to chattering to such a degree that he began to discuss\r\nlove, women, his future, the manner in which he conceived of happiness,\r\nwhat he demanded of Fate.... He explained himself allegorically, by\r\nhints. On the eve of his possible death, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch flirted\r\nwith Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.\r\n\r\nShe listened to him attentively, laughed, shook her head, now disputed\r\nwith him, again pretended to be incredulous.... The conversation,\r\nfrequently interrupted by the approach of ladies and cavaliers, took a\r\nrather strange turn toward the end.... Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch had already\r\nbegun to interrogate Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna about herself, her character,\r\nher sympathies. At first she parried the questions with a jest, then,\r\nsuddenly, and quite unexpectedly to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, she asked him\r\nwhen he was going away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhither?\xe2\x80\x9d--he said, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo your own home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo S\xc3\xa1sovo?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, home, to your village, a hundred versts from here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch cast down his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to go as promptly as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said with a\r\npreoccupied look on his face.--\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, I think ... if I am alive.\r\nFor I have business on hand. But why have you suddenly taken it into\r\nyour head to ask me about that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have!\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is the reason?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have!\xe2\x80\x9d--she repeated.--\xe2\x80\x9cI am surprised at the curiosity of a\r\nman who is going away to-morrow, and to-day wants to find out about my\r\ncharacter....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, pardon me ...\xe2\x80\x9d began Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, here, by the way ... read this,\xe2\x80\x9d--Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna interrupted\r\nhim with a laugh, as she handed him a motto-slip of paper from bonbons\r\nwhich she had just taken from a small table that stood near by, as she\r\nrose to meet M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, who had stopped in front of her with\r\nanother lady.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna was dancing with Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch. Her face was covered\r\nwith a flush, and was flaming, but not cheerful.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch glanced at the slip of paper; thereon, in wretched\r\nFrench letters, was printed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c_Qui me n\xc3\xa9glige me perd._\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes, and encountered Steltch\xc3\xadnsky\xe2\x80\x99s gaze bent upon him.\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch smiled constrainedly, threw his elbow over the back\r\nof the chair, and crossed his legs--as much as to say: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care for\r\nthee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe fiery artillery officer brought Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna up to her chair\r\nwith a dash, pirouetted gently in front of her, bowed, clicked his\r\nspurs, and departed. She sat down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to inquire,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, with pauses between\r\nhis words,--\xe2\x80\x9cin what sense I am to understand this billet?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what in the world does it say?\xe2\x80\x9d--said Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna.--\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\r\nyes! \xe2\x80\x98_Qui me n\xc3\xa9glige me perd._\xe2\x80\x99 Well! that\xe2\x80\x99s an admirable rule of life,\r\nwhich may be of service at every step. In order to make a success of\r\nanything, no matter what, one must not neglect anything whatsoever....\r\nOne must endeavour to obtain everything; perhaps one will obtain\r\nsomething. But I am ridiculous. I ... I am talking to you, a practical\r\nman, about rules of life....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna burst into a laugh, and Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch strove,\r\nin vain, to the very end of the mazurka, to renew their previous\r\nconversation. Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna avoided it with the perversity of a\r\ncapricious child. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch talked to her about his\r\nsentiments, and she either did not reply to him at all, or else she\r\ncalled his attention to the gowns of the ladies, to the ridiculous\r\nfaces of some of the men, to the skill with which her brother danced, to\r\nthe beauty of M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna; she began to talk about music, about the\r\nday before, about Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch and his wife, Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna ...\r\nand only at the very close of the mazurka, when Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was\r\nbeginning to make her his farewell bow, did she say, with an ironical\r\nsmile on her lips and in her eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you are positively going to-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; and very far away, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you a happy journey.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna swiftly approached her brother, merrily\r\nwhispered something in his ear, then asked aloud:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrateful to me? Yes? art thou not? otherwise he would have asked _her_\r\nfor the mazurka.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, nothing will come of it....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe led him off into the drawing-room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe flirt!\xe2\x80\x9d--thought Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, and taking his hat in his\r\nhand, he slipped unnoticed from the hall, hunted up his footman, to whom\r\nhe had previously given orders to hold himself in readiness, and was\r\nalready donning his overcoat, when suddenly, to his intense surprise,\r\nthe lackey informed him that it was impossible to depart, as the\r\ncoachman, in some unknown manner, had drunk to intoxication, and that\r\nit was utterly impossible to arouse him. After cursing the coachman in a\r\nremarkably brief but extremely powerful manner (this took place in the\r\nanteroom, outside witnesses were present), and informing his footman\r\nthat if the coachman was not in proper condition by daylight to-morrow,\r\nthen no one in the world would be capable of picturing to himself what\r\nthe result would be, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch returned to the hall, and\r\nrequested the major-domo to allot him a chamber, without waiting for\r\nsupper, which was already prepared in the drawing-room. The master of\r\nthe house suddenly popped up, as it were, out of the floor, at Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s very elbow (Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch wore boots without heels,\r\nand therefore moved about without the slightest sound), and began to\r\nhold him back, assuring him that there would be caviar of the very best\r\nquality for supper; but Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch excused himself on the plea\r\nof a headache. Half an hour later he was lying in a small bed, under a\r\nshort coverlet, and trying to get to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut he could not get to sleep. Toss as he would from side to side,\r\nstrive as he would to think of something else, the figure of\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky importunately towered up before him.... Now he is taking\r\naim ... now he has fired.... \xe2\x80\x9cAst\xc3\xa1khoff is killed,\xe2\x80\x9d says some one.\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch could not be called a brave man, yet he was no\r\ncoward; but even the thought of a duel, no matter with whom, had never\r\nonce entered his head.... Fight! with his good sense, peaceable\r\ndisposition, respect for the conventions, dreams of future prosperity,\r\nand an advantageous marriage! If it had not been a question of his own\r\nperson, he would have laughed heartily, so stupid and ridiculous did\r\nthis affair seem to him. Fight! with whom, and about what?!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPhew! damn it! what nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d--he exclaimed involuntarily\r\naloud.--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and what if he really does kill me?\xe2\x80\x9d--he continued his\r\nmeditations;--\xe2\x80\x9cI must take measures, make arrangements.... Who will\r\nmourn for me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd in vexation he closed his eyes, which were staringly-wide open, drew\r\nthe coverlet up around his neck ... but could not get to sleep,\r\nnevertheless....\r\n\r\nDawn was already breaking, and exhausted with the fever of insomnia,\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was beginning to fall into a doze, when suddenly he\r\nfelt some weight or other on his feet. He opened his eyes.... On his bed\r\nsat V\xc3\xa9retyeff.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was greatly amazed, especially when he noticed that\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff had no coat on, that beneath his unbuttoned shirt his bare\r\nbreast was visible, that his hair was tumbling over his forehead, and\r\nthat his very face appeared changed. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch got half-way\r\nout of bed....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to ask ...\xe2\x80\x9d he began, throwing his hands apart....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come to you,\xe2\x80\x9d--said V\xc3\xa9retyeff, in a hoarse voice;--\xe2\x80\x9cexcuse me\r\nfor coming in such a guise.... We have been drinking a bit yonder. I\r\nwanted to put you at ease. I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Yonder lies a gentleman\r\nwho, in all probability, cannot get to sleep.--Let\xe2\x80\x99s help\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99--Understand; you are not going to fight to-morrow, and can go to\r\nsleep....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was still more amazed than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that you said?\xe2\x80\x9d--he muttered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; that has all been adjusted,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on V\xc3\xa9retyeff;--\xe2\x80\x9cthat gentleman\r\nfrom the banks of the Visla ... Steltch\xc3\xadnsky ... makes his apologies to\r\nyou ... to-morrow you will receive a letter.... I repeat to you:--all is\r\nsettled.... Snore away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo saying, V\xc3\xa9retyeff rose, and directed his course, with unsteady steps,\r\ntoward the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut permit me, permit me,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you\r\nhave found out, and how can I believe....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh! you think that I ... you know ...\xe2\x80\x9d (and he reeled forward\r\nslightly).... \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you ... he will send a letter to you to-morrow....\r\nYou do not arouse any particular sympathy in me, but magnanimity is my\r\nweak side. But what\xe2\x80\x99s the use of talking.... It\xe2\x80\x99s all nonsense\r\nanyway.... But confess,\xe2\x80\x9d--he added, with a wink;--\xe2\x80\x9cyou were pretty well\r\nscared, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you, hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch flew into a rage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPermit me, in conclusion, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good, good,\xe2\x80\x9d--V\xc3\xa9retyeff interrupted him with a good-natured\r\nsmile.--\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t fly into a passion. Evidently you are not aware that no\r\nball ever takes place without that sort of thing. That\xe2\x80\x99s the established\r\nrule. It never amounts to anything. Who feels like exposing his brow?\r\nWell, and why not bluster, hey? at newcomers, for instance? _In vino\r\nveritas._ However, neither you nor I know Latin. But I see by your face\r\nthat you are sleepy. I wish you good night, Mr. Positive Man,\r\nwell-intentioned mortal. Accept this wish from another mortal who isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nworth a brass farthing himself. _Addio, mio caro!_\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd V\xc3\xa9retyeff left the room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil knows what this means!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, after\r\na brief pause, banging his fist into the pillow;--\xe2\x80\x9cno one ever heard the\r\nlike!... this must be cleared up! I won\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, five minutes later he was already sleeping softly and\r\nprofoundly.... Danger escaped fills the soul of man with sweetness, and\r\nsoftens it.\r\n\r\nThis is what had taken place before that unanticipated nocturnal\r\ninterview between V\xc3\xa9retyeff and Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\nIn Gavr\xc3\xadla Step\xc3\xa1nitch\xe2\x80\x99s house lived his grand-nephew, who occupied\r\nbachelor quarters in the lower story. When there were balls on hand, the\r\nyoung men dropped in at his rooms between the dances, to smoke a hasty\r\npipe, and after supper they assembled there for a friendly\r\ndrinking-bout. A good many of the guests had dropped in on him that\r\nnight. Steltch\xc3\xadnsky and V\xc3\xa9retyeff were among the number; Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch,\r\nThe Folding Soul, also wandered in there in the wake of the others. They\r\nbrewed a punch. Although Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch had promised Ast\xc3\xa1khoff that he\r\nwould not mention the impending duel to any one whomsoever, yet, when\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff accidentally asked him what he had been talking about with\r\nthat glum fellow (V\xc3\xa9retyeff never alluded to Ast\xc3\xa1khoff otherwise), The\r\nFolding Soul could not contain himself, and repeated his entire\r\nconversation with Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, word for word.\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff burst out laughing, then lapsed into meditation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut with whom is he going to fight?\xe2\x80\x9d--he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I cannot say,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt all events, with whom has he been talking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith different people.... With Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch. It cannot be that he\r\nis going to fight with him?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff went away from Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch.\r\n\r\nSo, then, they made a punch, and began to drink. V\xc3\xa9retyeff was sitting\r\nin the most conspicuous place. Jolly and profligate, he held the\r\npre-eminence in gatherings of young men. He threw off his waistcoat and\r\nneckcloth. He was asked to sing; he took a guitar and sang several\r\nsongs. Heads began to wax rather hot; the young men began to propose\r\ntoasts. Suddenly Steltch\xc3\xadnsky, all red in the face, sprang upon the\r\ntable, and elevating his glass high above his head, exclaimed loudly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the health ... of I know whom,\xe2\x80\x9d--he hastily caught himself up, drank\r\noff his liquor, and smashed his glass on the floor, adding:--\xe2\x80\x9cMay my foe\r\nbe shivered into just such pieces to-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff, who had long had his eye on him, swiftly raised his head....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteltch\xc3\xadnsky,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he,--\xe2\x80\x9cin the first place, get off the table;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s indecorous, and you have very bad boots into the bargain; and, in\r\nthe second place, come hither, I will tell thee something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led him aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHearken, brother; I know that thou art going to fight to-morrow with\r\nthat gentleman from Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky started.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow ... who told thee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell thee it is so. And I also know on whose account thou art going\r\nto fight.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? I am curious to know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh, get out with thee, thou Talleyrand! My sister\xe2\x80\x99s, of course. Come,\r\ncome, don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to be surprised. It gives you a goose-like\r\nexpression. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine how this has come about, but it is a fact.\r\nThat will do, my good fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued V\xc3\xa9retyeff.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of\r\nshamming? I know, you see, that you have been paying court to her this\r\nlong time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, nevertheless, that does not prove....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop, if you please. But hearken to what I am about to say to you. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t permit that duel under any circumstances whatsoever. Dost\r\nunderstand? All this folly will descend upon my sister. Excuse me: so\r\nlong as I am alive ... that shall not be. As for thou and I, we shall\r\nperish--we\xe2\x80\x99re on the road to it; but she must live a long time yet, and\r\nlive happily. Yes, I swear,\xe2\x80\x9d--he added, with sudden heat,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat I will\r\nbetray all others, even those who might be ready to sacrifice everything\r\nfor me, but I will not permit any one to touch a single hair of her\r\nhead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky emitted a forced laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art drunk, my dear fellow, and art raving ... that\xe2\x80\x99s all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd art not thou, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know? But whether I am drunk or not, is a\r\nmatter of not the slightest consequence. But I\xe2\x80\x99m talking business. Thou\r\nshalt not fight with that gentleman, I guarantee that. And what in the\r\nworld possessed thee to have anything to do with him? Hast grown\r\njealous, pray? Well, those speak the truth who say that men in love are\r\nstupid! Why she danced with him simply in order to prevent his\r\ninviting.... Well, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. But this duel shall not\r\ntake place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! I should like to see how thou wilt prevent me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, this way: if thou dost not instantly give me thy word to\r\nrenounce this duel, I will fight with thee myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow, entertain no doubt on that score. I will insult thee on\r\nthe spot, my little friend, in the presence of every one, in the most\r\nfantastic manner, and then fight thee across a handkerchief, if thou\r\nwilt. But I think that will be disagreeable to thee, for many reasons,\r\nhey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSteltch\xc3\xadnsky flared up, began to say that this was _intimidation_,[28]\r\nthat he would not permit any one to meddle with his affairs, that he\r\nwould not stick at anything ... and wound up by submitting, and\r\nrenouncing all attempts on the life of Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch. V\xc3\xa9retyeff\r\nembraced him, and half an hour had not elapsed, before the two had\r\nalready drunk Br\xc3\xbcderschaft for the tenth time,--that is to say, they\r\ndrank with arms interlocked.... The young man who had acted as\r\nfloor-manager of the ball also drank Br\xc3\xbcderschaft with them, and at\r\nfirst clung close to them, but finally fell asleep in the most innocent\r\nmanner, and lay for a long time on his back in a condition of complete\r\ninsensibility.... The expression of his tiny, pale face was both amusing\r\nand pitiful.... Good heavens! what would those fashionable ladies, his\r\nacquaintances, have said, if they had beheld him in that condition! But,\r\nluckily for him, he was not acquainted with a single fashionable lady.\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch also distinguished himself on that night. First he amazed\r\nthe guests by suddenly striking up: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the country a Baron once dwelt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe hawfinch! The hawfinch has begun to sing!\xe2\x80\x9d--shouted all. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen has\r\nit ever happened that a hawfinch has sung by night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs though I knew only one song,\xe2\x80\x9d--retorted Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, who was heated\r\nwith liquor;--\xe2\x80\x9cI know some more, too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, come, show us your art.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch maintained silence for a while, and suddenly struck up in a\r\nbass voice: \xe2\x80\x9cKrambambuli,[29] bequest of our fathers!\xe2\x80\x9d but so\r\nincoherently and strangely, that a general outburst of laughter\r\nimmediately drowned his voice, and he fell silent. When all had\r\ndispersed, V\xc3\xa9retyeff betook himself to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, and the\r\nbrief conversation already reported, ensued between them.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch drove off to his own S\xc3\xa1sovo\r\nvery early. He passed the whole morning in a state of excitement, came\r\nnear mistaking a passing merchant for a second, and breathed freely only\r\nwhen his lackey brought him a letter from Steltch\xc3\xadnsky. Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch perused that letter several times,--it was very adroitly\r\nworded.... Steltch\xc3\xadnsky began with the words: \xe2\x80\x9c_La nuit porte conseil,\r\nMonsieur_,\xe2\x80\x9d--made no excuses whatever, because, in his opinion, he had\r\nnot insulted his antagonist in any way; but admitted that he had been\r\nsomewhat irritated on the preceding evening, and wound up with the\r\nstatement that he held himself entirely at the disposition of Mr.\r\nAst\xc3\xa1khoff (\xe2\x80\x9c_de M-r Ast\xc3\xa1khoff_\xe2\x80\x9d), but no longer demanded satisfaction\r\nhimself. After having composed and despatched a reply, which was\r\nfilled, simultaneously with courtesy which bordered on playfulness, and\r\na sense of dignity, in which, however, no trace of braggadocio was\r\nperceptible, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch sat down to dinner, rubbing his hands,\r\nate with great satisfaction, and immediately afterward set off, without\r\nhaving even sent relays on in advance. The road along which he drove\r\npassed at a distance of four versts from Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s manor.... Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch looked at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, region of dead calm!\xe2\x80\x9d--he said with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe images of Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna and M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna presented\r\nthemselves for a moment to his imagination; he dismissed them with a\r\nwave of his hand, and sank into a doze.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMore than three months had passed. Autumn had long since set in; the\r\nyellow forests had grown bare, the tomtits had arrived, and--unfailing\r\nsign of the near approach of winter--the wind had begun to howl and\r\nwail. But there had been no heavy rains, as yet, and mud had not\r\nsucceeded in spreading itself over the roads. Taking advantage of this\r\ncircumstance, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch set out for the government capital,\r\nfor the purpose of winding up several matters of business. He spent the\r\nmorning in driving about, and in the evening went to the club. In the\r\nvast, gloomy hall of the club he encountered several acquaintances, and,\r\namong others, the old retired captain of cavalry Flitch, a busybody,\r\nwit, gambler, and gossip, well known to every one. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch\r\nentered into conversation with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, by the way!\xe2\x80\x9d--suddenly exclaimed the retired cavalry-captain; \xe2\x80\x9can\r\nacquaintance of yours passed through here the other day, and left her\r\ncompliments for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMadame Steltch\xc3\xadnsky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any Madame Steltch\xc3\xadnsky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou knew her as a girl.... She was born V\xc3\xa9retyeff.... Nad\xc3\xa9zhda\r\nAlexy\xc3\xa9evna. Her husband served our Governor. You must have seen him\r\nalso.... A lively man, with a moustache.... He\xe2\x80\x99s hooked a splendid\r\nwoman, with money to boot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cSo she has married\r\nhim.... H\xe2\x80\x99m! And where have they gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Petersburg. She also bade me remind you of a certain bonbon\r\nmotto.... What sort of a motto was it, allow me to inquire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the old gossip thrust forward his sharp nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember, really; some jest or other,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut permit me to ask, where is her brother now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPi\xc3\xb3tr? Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Flitch rolled up his small, foxy eyes, and heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe has taken to dissipation! He\xe2\x80\x99s a ruined man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is absolutely unknown where he is. He went off somewhere or other\r\nafter a gipsy girl; that\xe2\x80\x99s the most certain thing of all. He\xe2\x80\x99s not in\r\nthis government, I\xe2\x80\x99ll guarantee that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does old Ip\xc3\xa1toff still live there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1itch? That eccentric old fellow? Yes, he still lives\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is everything in his household ... as it used to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, certainly. Here now, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you marry his sister-in-law?\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s not a woman, you know, she\xe2\x80\x99s simply a monument, really. Ha, ha!\r\nPeople have already been talking among us ... \xe2\x80\x98why,\xe2\x80\x99 say they....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t say so, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--articulated Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, narrowing his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Flitch was invited to a cardgame, and the conversation\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch had intended to return home promptly; but suddenly\r\nhe received by special messenger a report from the overseer, that six of\r\nthe peasants\xe2\x80\x99 homesteads had burned down in S\xc3\xa1sovo, and he decided to go\r\nthither himself. The distance from the government capital to S\xc3\xa1sovo was\r\nreckoned at sixty versts. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch arrived toward evening at\r\nthe wing with which the reader is already acquainted, immediately gave\r\norders that the overseer and clerk should be summoned, scolded them both\r\nin proper fashion, inspected the scene of the conflagration next\r\nmorning, took the necessary measures, and after dinner, after some\r\nwavering, set off to visit Ip\xc3\xa1toff. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch would have\r\nremained at home, had he not heard from Flitch of Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeparture; he did not wish to meet her; but he was not averse to taking\r\nanother look at M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, as on the occasion of his first visit, found\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff busy at draughts with The Folding Soul. The old man was\r\ndelighted to see him; yet it seemed to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch as though his\r\nface were troubled, and his speech did not flow freely and readily as of\r\nold.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch exchanged a silent glance with Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch. Both\r\nwinced a little; but they speedily recovered their serenity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre all your family well?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, thank God, I thank you sincerely,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Ip\xc3\xa1toff.--\xe2\x80\x9cOnly M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite ... you know, she stays in her room most of the\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she caught cold?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo ... she just likes to. She will make her appearance at tea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch? What is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh! Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch is a dead man. His wife has died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt cannot be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe died in twenty-four hours, of cholera. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know him now,\r\nhe has become simply unrecognisable. \xe2\x80\x98Without Matry\xc3\xb3na M\xc3\xa1rkovna,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nsays, \xe2\x80\x98life is a burden to me. I shall die,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98and God be\r\nthanked,\xe2\x80\x99 he says; \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to live,\xe2\x80\x99 says he. Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s done for,\r\npoor fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh! good heavens, how unpleasant that is!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cPoor Eg\xc3\xb3r Kap\xc3\xadtonitch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll were silent for a time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear that your pretty neighbour has married,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch, flushing faintly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna? Yes, she has.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff darted a sidelong glance at Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly ... certainly, she has married and gone away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo Petersburg?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo St. Petersburg.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna must miss her, I think. I believe they were great\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course she misses her. That cannot be avoided. But as for\r\nfriendship, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell you, that the friendship of girls is even\r\nworse than the friendship of men. So long as they are face to face, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall right; but, otherwise, it vanishes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, by Heaven, \xe2\x80\x99tis so! Take Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, for example. She\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t written to us since she went away; but how she promised, even\r\nvowed that she would! In truth, she\xe2\x80\x99s in no mood for that now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd has she been gone long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; it must be fully six weeks. She hurried off on the very day after\r\nthe wedding, foreign fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hear that her brother is no longer here, either?\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch, after a brief pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; he is not. They are city folk, you see; as though they would live\r\nlong in the country!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd does no one know where he has gone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe just went into a rage, and--slap-bang on the ear,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Iv\xc3\xa1n\r\n\xc3\x8dlitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe just went into a rage, and--slap-bang on the ear,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ip\xc3\xa1toff.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, and how about yourself, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,--what nice things\r\nhave you been doing?\xe2\x80\x9d--he added, wheeling round on his chair.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch began to tell about himself; Ip\xc3\xa1toff listened and\r\nlistened to him, and at last exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna come? Thou hadst better go for her, Iv\xc3\xa1n\r\n\xc3\x8dlitch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch left the room, and returning, reported that M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna\r\nwould be there directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter? Has she got a headache?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Ip\xc3\xa1toff, in an\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna entered. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch rose,\r\nbowed, and could not utter a word, so great was his amazement: so\r\nchanged was M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna since he had seen her the last time! The rosy\r\nbloom had vanished from her emaciated cheeks; a broad black ring\r\nencircled her eyes; her lips were bitterly compressed; her whole face,\r\nimpassive and dark, seemed to have become petrified.\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes, and there was no spark in them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you feel now?\xe2\x80\x9d Ip\xc3\xa1toff asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am well,\xe2\x80\x9d--she replied; and sat down at the table, on which the\r\nsamov\xc3\xa1r was already bubbling.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch was pretty thoroughly bored that evening. But no one\r\nwas in good spirits. The conversation persisted in taking a cheerless\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust listen,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Ip\xc3\xa1toff, among other things, as he lent an ear to\r\nthe howling of the wind;--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat notes it emits! The summer is long since\r\npast; and here is autumn passing, too, and winter is at the door. Again\r\nwe shall be buried in snow-drifts. I hope the snow will fall very soon.\r\nOtherwise, when you go out into the garden, melancholy descends upon\r\nyou.... Just as though there were some sort of a ruin there. The\r\nbranches of the trees clash together.... Yes, the fine days are over!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are over,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch.\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna stared silently out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod willing, they will return,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Ip\xc3\xa1toff.\r\n\r\nNo one answered him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember how finely they sang songs here that time?\xe2\x80\x9d--said\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think they did,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied the old man, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you might sing to us,\xe2\x80\x9d--went on Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, turning to\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna;--\xe2\x80\x9cyou have such a fine voice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch inquired of Ip\xc3\xa1toff, not\r\nknowing what to talk about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God! she gets on nicely, considering her ailments. She came over\r\nin her little carriage to-day. She\xe2\x80\x99s a broken tree, I must tell\r\nyou--creak, creak, and the first you know, some young, strong sapling\r\nfalls over; but she goes on standing and standing. Ekh, ha, ha!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna dropped her hands in her lap, and bowed her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, nevertheless, her existence is hard,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Ip\xc3\xa1toff\r\nagain;--\xe2\x80\x9crightly is it said: \xe2\x80\x98old age is no joy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no joy in being young,\xe2\x80\x9d--said M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, as though to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch would have liked to return home that night, but it\r\nwas so dark out of doors that he could not make up his mind to set out.\r\nHe was assigned to the same chamber, up-stairs, in which, three months\r\npreviously, he had passed a troubled night, thanks to Eg\xc3\xb3r\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he snore now?\xe2\x80\x9d--thought Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, as he recalled his\r\ndrilling of his servant, and the sudden appearance of M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna in\r\nthe garden....\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch walked to the window, and laid his brow against the\r\ncold glass. His own face gazed dimly at him from out of doors, as though\r\nhis eyes were riveted upon a black curtain, and it was only after a\r\nconsiderable time that he was able to make out against the starless sky\r\nthe branches of the trees, writhing wildly in the gloom. They were\r\nharassed by a turbulent wind.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it seemed to Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch as though something white had\r\nflashed along the ground.... He gazed more intently, laughed, shrugged\r\nhis shoulders, and exclaiming in an undertone: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what imagination\r\nwill do!\xe2\x80\x9d got into bed.\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep very soon; but he was not fated to pass a quiet night on\r\nthis occasion either. He was awakened by a running to and fro, which\r\narose in the house.... He raised his head from the pillow.... Agitated\r\nvoices, exclamations, hurried footsteps were audible, doors were\r\nbanging; now the sound of women weeping rang out, shouts were set up in\r\nthe garden, other cries farther off responded.... The uproar in the\r\nhouse increased, and became more noisy with every moment.... \xe2\x80\x9cFire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nflashed through Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s mind. In alarm he sprang from his\r\nbed, and rushed to the window; but there was no redness in the sky;\r\nonly, in the garden, points of flame were moving briskly along the\r\npaths,--caused by people running about with lanterns. Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch went quickly to the door, opened it, and ran directly into\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch. Pale, dishevelled, half-clothed, the latter was dashing\r\nonward, without himself knowing whither.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it? What has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\r\nexcitedly, seizing him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe has disappeared; she has thrown herself into the water,\xe2\x80\x9d--replied\r\nIv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, in a choking voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho has thrown herself into the water? Who has disappeared?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cM\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna! Who else could it be but M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna? She has\r\nperished, the darling! Help! Good heavens, let us run as fast as we can!\r\nBe quick, my dear people!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch rushed down the stairs.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch put on his shoes somehow, threw his cloak over his\r\nshoulders, and ran after him.\r\n\r\nIn the house he no longer encountered any one, all had hastened out into\r\nthe garden; only the little girls, Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, met him in the\r\ncorridor, near the anteroom; deadly pale with terror, they stood there\r\nin their little white petticoats, with clasped hands and bare feet,\r\nbeside a night-lamp set on the floor. Through the drawing-room, past an\r\noverturned table, flew Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch to the terrace. Through the\r\ngrove, in the direction of the dam, light and shadows were flashing....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo for boat-hooks! Go for boat-hooks as quickly as\r\npossible!\xe2\x80\x9d--Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s voice could be heard shouting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA net, a net, a boat!\xe2\x80\x9d--shouted other voices.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch ran in the direction of the shouts. He found Ip\xc3\xa1toff\r\non the shore of the pond; a lantern hung on a bough brilliantly\r\nilluminated the old man\xe2\x80\x99s grey head. He was wringing his hands, and\r\nreeling like a drunken man; by his side, a woman lay writhing and\r\nsobbing on the grass; round about men were bustling. Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch had\r\nalready advanced into the water up to his knees, and was feeling the\r\nbottom with a pole; a coachman was undressing, trembling all over as he\r\ndid so; two men were dragging a boat along the shore; a sharp trampling\r\nof hoofs was audible along the village street.... The wind swept past\r\nwith a shriek, as though endeavouring to quench the lantern, while the\r\npond plashed noisily, darkling in a menacing way....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I hear?\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, rushing up to\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff.--\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe boat-hooks--fetch the boat-hooks!\xe2\x80\x9d--moaned the old man by way of\r\nreply to him....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut good gracious, perhaps you are mistaken, Mikha\xc3\xadl Nikol\xc3\xa1itch....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, mistaken indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d--said the woman who was lying on the grass, M\xc3\xa1rya\r\nP\xc3\xa1vlovna\xe2\x80\x99s maid, in a tearful voice. \xe2\x80\x9cUnlucky creature that I am, I\r\nheard her myself, the darling, throw herself into the water, and\r\nstruggling in the water, and screaming: \xe2\x80\x98Save me!\xe2\x80\x99 and then, once more:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Save me!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you prevent her, pray?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how was I to prevent her, dear little father, my lord? Why, when I\r\ndiscovered it, she was no longer in her room, but my heart had a\r\nforeboding, you know; these last days she has been so sad all the time,\r\nand has said nothing; so I knew how it was, and rushed straight into the\r\ngarden, just as though some one had made me do it; and suddenly I heard\r\nsomething go splash! into the water: \xe2\x80\x98Save me!\xe2\x80\x99 I heard the cry: \xe2\x80\x98Save\r\nme!\xe2\x80\x99... Okh, my darling, light of my eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps it only seemed so to thee!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeemed so, forsooth! But where is she? what has become of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo that is what looked white to me in the gloom,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch....\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, men had run up with boat-hooks, dragged thither a net,\r\nand begun to spread it out on the grass, a great throng of people had\r\nassembled, a commotion had arisen, and a jostling ... the coachman\r\nseized one boat-hook, the village elder seized another, both sprang into\r\nthe boat, put off, and set to searching the water with the hooks; the\r\npeople on the shore lighted them. Strange and dreadful did their\r\nmovements seem, and their shadows in the gloom, above the agitated pond,\r\nin the dim and uncertain light of the lanterns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe ... here, the hook has caught!\xe2\x80\x9d--suddenly cried the coachman.\r\n\r\nAll stood stock-still where they were.\r\n\r\nThe coachman pulled the hook toward him, and bent over.... Something\r\nhorned and black slowly came to the surface....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA tree-stump,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the coachman, pulling away the hook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut come back, come back!\xe2\x80\x9d--they shouted to him from the shore.--\xe2\x80\x9cThou\r\nwilt accomplish nothing with the hooks; thou must use the net.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, the net!\xe2\x80\x9d--chimed in others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the elder;--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got hold of something also ... something\r\nsoft, apparently,\xe2\x80\x9d--he added, after a brief pause.\r\n\r\nA white spot made its appearance alongside the boat....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d--suddenly shouted the elder.--\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Tis she!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was not mistaken.... The hook had caught M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna by the sleeve\r\nof her gown. The coachman immediately seized her, dragged her out of the\r\nwater ... in a couple of powerful strokes the boat was at the shore....\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toff, Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, all rushed to M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna,\r\nraised her up, bore her home in their arms, immediately undressed her,\r\nand began to roll her, and warm her.... But all their efforts, their\r\nexertions, proved vain.... M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna did not come to herself....\r\nLife had already left her.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch left Ip\xc3\xa1tovka;\r\nbefore his departure, he went to bid farewell to the dead woman. She was\r\nlying on the table in the drawing-room in a white gown.... Her thick\r\nhair was not yet entirely dry, a sort of mournful surprise was expressed\r\non her pale face, which had not had time to grow distorted; her parted\r\nlips seemed to be trying to speak, and ask something; ... her hands,\r\nconvulsively clasped, as though with grief, were pressed tight to her\r\nbreast.... But with whatever sorrowful thought the poor drowned girl had\r\nperished, death had laid upon her the seal of its eternal silence and\r\npeace ... and who understands what a dead face expresses during those\r\nfew moments when, for the last time, it meets the glance of the living\r\nbefore it vanishes forever and is destroyed in the grave?\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch stood for a while in decorous meditation before the\r\nbody of M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, crossed himself thrice, and left the room,\r\nwithout having noticed Iv\xc3\xa1n \xc3\x8dlitch who was weeping softly in one\r\ncorner.... And he was not the only one who wept that day: all the\r\nservants in the house wept bitterly: M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna had left a good\r\nmemory behind her.\r\n\r\nThe following is what old Ip\xc3\xa1toff wrote, a week later, in reply to a\r\nletter which had come, at last, from Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cOne week ago, dear Madam, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, my unhappy\r\n     sister-in-law, your acquaintance, M\xc3\xa1rya P\xc3\xa1vlovna, wilfully ended\r\n     her own life, by throwing herself by night into the pond, and we\r\n     have already committed her body to the earth. She decided upon this\r\n     sad and terrible deed, without having bidden me farewell, without\r\n     leaving even a letter or so much as a note, to declare her last\r\n     will.... But you know better than any one else, Nad\xc3\xa9zhda\r\n     Alexy\xc3\xa9evna, on whose soul this great and deadly sin must fall! May\r\n     the Lord God judge your brother, for my sister-in-law could not\r\n     cease to love him, nor survive the separation....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna received this letter in Italy, whither she had gone\r\nwith her husband, Count de Steltch\xc3\xadnsky, as he was called in all the\r\nhotels. He did not visit hotels alone, however; he was frequently seen\r\nin gambling-houses, in the Kur-Saal at the baths.... At first he lost a\r\ngreat deal of money, then he ceased to lose, and his face assumed a\r\npeculiar expression, not precisely suspicious, nor yet precisely\r\ninsolent, like that which a man has who unexpectedly gets involved in\r\nscandals.... He saw his wife rarely. But Nad\xc3\xa9zhda Alexy\xc3\xa9evna did not\r\nlanguish in his absence. She developed a passion for painting and the\r\nfine arts. She associated chiefly with artists, and was fond of\r\ndiscussing the beautiful with young men. Ip\xc3\xa1toff\xe2\x80\x99s letter grieved her\r\ngreatly, but did not prevent her going that same day to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Dogs\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCave,\xe2\x80\x9d to see how the poor animals suffocated when immersed in sulphur\r\nfumes.\r\n\r\nShe did not go alone. She was escorted by divers cavaliers. Among their\r\nnumber, a certain Mr. Popelin, an artist--a Frenchman, who had not\r\nfinished his course--with a small beard, and dressed in a checked\r\nsack-coat, was the most agreeable. He sang the newest romances in a thin\r\ntenor voice, made very free-and-easy jokes, and although he was gaunt of\r\nform, yet he ate a very great deal.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt was a sunny, cold January day; a multitude of people were strolling\r\non the N\xc3\xa9vsky Prosp\xc3\xa9kt. The clock on the tower of the city hall marked\r\nthree o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Along the broad stone slabs, strewn with yellow sand, was\r\nwalking, among others, our acquaintance Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch Ast\xc3\xa1khoff.\r\nHe has grown very virile since we parted from him; his face is framed in\r\nwhiskers, and he has grown plump all over, but he has not aged. He was\r\nmoving after the crowd at a leisurely pace, and now and then casting a\r\nglance about him; he was expecting his wife; she had preferred to drive\r\nup in the carriage with her mother. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch married five\r\nyears ago, precisely in the manner which he had always desired: his wife\r\nwas wealthy, and with the best of connections. Courteously lifting his\r\nsplendidly brushed hat when he met his numerous acquaintances, Vlad\xc3\xadmir\r\nSergy\xc3\xa9itch was still stepping out with the free stride of a man who is\r\nsatisfied with his lot, when suddenly, just at the Passage,[30] he came\r\nnear colliding with a gentleman in a Spanish cloak and foraging-cap,\r\nwith a decidedly worn face, a dyed moustache, and large, swollen eyes.\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch drew aside with dignity, but the gentleman in the\r\nforaging-cap glanced at him, and suddenly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Mr. Ast\xc3\xa1khoff, how do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch made no reply, and stopped short in surprise. He\r\ncould not comprehend how a gentleman who could bring himself to walk on\r\nthe N\xc3\xa9vsky in a foraging-cap could be acquainted with his name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not recognise me,\xe2\x80\x9d--pursued the gentleman in the cap:--\xe2\x80\x9cI saw\r\nyou eight years ago, in the country, in the T*** Government, at the\r\nIp\xc3\xa1toffs\xe2\x80\x99. My name is V\xc3\xa9retyeff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh! Good heavens! excuse me!\xe2\x80\x9d--exclaimed Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nhow you have changed since then!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I have grown old,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch, passing his hand,\r\nwhich was devoid of a glove, over his face.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have not changed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff had not so much aged as fallen away and sunk down. Small,\r\ndelicate wrinkles covered his face; and when he spoke, his lips and\r\ncheeks twitched slightly. From all this it was perceptible that the man\r\nhad been living hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you disappeared to all this time, that you have not been\r\nvisible?\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been wandering about here and there. And you have been in\r\nPetersburg all the while?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, most of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch assumed a rather severe mien, as though with the\r\nobject of saying to V\xc3\xa9retyeff: \xe2\x80\x9cMy good fellow, don\xe2\x80\x99t take it into thy\r\nhead to ask me to present thee to my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff understood him, apparently. An indifferent sneer barely\r\nflitted across his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how is your sister?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is\r\nshe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot tell you for certain. She must be in Moscow. I have not\r\nreceived any letters from her this long time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs her husband alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Ip\xc3\xa1toff?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know; probably he is alive also; but he may be dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that gentleman--what the deuce was his name?--Bodryak\xc3\xb3ff,--what of\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one you invited to be your second--you remember, when you were so\r\nscared? Why, the devil knows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch maintained silence for a while, with dignity written\r\non his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI always recall with pleasure those evenings,\xe2\x80\x9d--he went on,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I\r\nhad the opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d (he had nearly said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe honour\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cof making the\r\nacquaintance of your sister and yourself. She was a very amiable person.\r\nAnd do you sing as agreeably as ever?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have lost my voice.... But that was a good time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI visited Ip\xc3\xa1tovka once afterward,\xe2\x80\x9d--added Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch,\r\nelevating his eyebrows mournfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that was the name of that\r\nvillage--on the very day of a terrible event....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, that was frightful, frightful,\xe2\x80\x9d--V\xc3\xa9retyeff hastily\r\ninterrupted him.--\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes. And do you remember how you came near\r\nfighting with my present brother-in-law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cH\xe2\x80\x99m! I remember!\xe2\x80\x9d--replied Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, slowly.--\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\r\nmust confess to you that so much time has elapsed since then, that all\r\nthat sometimes seems to me like a dream....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike a dream,\xe2\x80\x9d--repeated V\xc3\xa9retyeff, and his pale cheeks flushed;--\xe2\x80\x9clike\r\na dream ... no, it was not a dream, for me at all events. It was the\r\ntime of youth, of mirth and happiness, the time of unlimited hopes, and\r\ninvincible powers; and if it was a dream, then it was a very beautiful\r\ndream. And now, you and I have grown old and stupid, we dye our\r\nmoustaches, and saunter on the N\xc3\xa9vsky, and have become good for nothing;\r\nlike broken-winded nags, we have become utterly vapid and worn out; it\r\ncannot be said that we are pompous and put on airs, nor that we spend\r\nour time in idleness; but I fear we drown our grief in drink,--that is\r\nmore like a dream, and a hideous dream. Life has been lived, and lived\r\nin vain, clumsily, vulgarly--that\xe2\x80\x99s what is bitter! That\xe2\x80\x99s what one\r\nwould like to shake off like a dream, that\xe2\x80\x99s what one would like to\r\nrecover one\xe2\x80\x99s self from!... And then ... everywhere, there is one\r\nfrightful memory, one ghost.... But farewell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeff walked hastily away; but on coming opposite the door of one of\r\nthe principal confectioners on the N\xc3\xa9vsky, he halted, entered, and after\r\ndrinking a glass of orange vodka at the buffet, he wended his way\r\nthrough the billiard-room, all dark and dim with tobacco-smoke, to the\r\nrear room. There he found several acquaintances, his former\r\ncomrades--P\xc3\xa9tya Laz\xc3\xbarin, K\xc3\xb3stya Kovr\xc3\xb3vsky, and Prince Serdiuk\xc3\xb3ff, and\r\ntwo other gentlemen who were called simply Vasi\xc3\xbak, and Fil\xc3\xa1t. All of\r\nthem were men no longer young, though unmarried; some of them had lost\r\ntheir hair, others were growing grey; their faces were covered with\r\nwrinkles, their chins had grown double; in a word, these gentlemen had\r\nall long since passed their prime, as the saying is. Yet all of them\r\ncontinued to regard V\xc3\xa9retyeff as a remarkable man, destined to astonish\r\nthe universe; and he was wiser than they only because he was very well\r\naware of his utter and radical uselessness. And even outside of his\r\ncircle, there were people who thought concerning him, that if he had not\r\nruined himself, the deuce only knows what he would have made of\r\nhimself.... These people were mistaken. Nothing ever comes of\r\nV\xc3\xa9retyeffs.\r\n\r\nPi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s friends welcomed him with the customary greetings. At\r\nfirst he dumbfounded them with his gloomy aspect and his splenetic\r\nspeeches; but he speedily calmed down, cheered up, and affairs went on\r\nin their wonted rut.\r\n\r\nBut Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, as soon as V\xc3\xa9retyeff left him, contracted his\r\nbrows in a frown and straightened himself up. Pi\xc3\xb3tr Alexy\xc3\xa9itch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunexpected sally had astounded, even offended him extremely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We have grown stupid, we drink liquor, we dye our moustaches\xe2\x80\x99 ...\r\n_parlez pour vous, mon cher_,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said at last, almost aloud, and\r\nemitting a couple of snorts caused by an access of involuntary\r\nindignation, he was preparing to continue his stroll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho was that talking with you?\xe2\x80\x9d--rang out a loud and self-confident\r\nvoice behind him.\r\n\r\nVlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch turned round and beheld one of his best friends, a\r\ncertain Mr. Pomp\xc3\xb3nsky. This Mr. Pomp\xc3\xb3nsky, a man of lofty stature, and\r\nstout, occupied a decidedly important post, and never once, from his\r\nvery earliest youth, had he doubted himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, a sort of eccentric,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, linking his arm\r\nin Mr. Pomp\xc3\xb3nsky\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood gracious, Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch, is it permissible for a respectable\r\nman to chat on the street with an individual who wears a foraging-cap on\r\nhis head? \xe2\x80\x99Tis indecent! I\xe2\x80\x99m amazed! Where could you have made\r\nacquaintance with such a person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the country.... One does not bow to one\xe2\x80\x99s country neighbours in\r\ntown.... _ce n\xe2\x80\x99est pas comme il faut_. A gentleman should always bear\r\nhimself like a gentleman if he wishes that....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d--Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch hastily interrupted him.--\xe2\x80\x9cLet\r\nus go to her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the two gentlemen directed their steps to a low-hung, elegant\r\ncarriage, from whose window there peered forth the pale, weary, and\r\nirritatingly-arrogant little face of a woman who was still young, but\r\nalready faded.\r\n\r\nBehind her another lady, also apparently in a bad humour,--her\r\nmother,--was visible. Vlad\xc3\xadmir Sergy\xc3\xa9itch opened the door of the\r\ncarriage, and offered his arm to his wife. Pomp\xc3\xb3nsky gave his to the\r\nmother-in-law, and the two couples made their way along the N\xc3\xa9vsky\r\nProsp\xc3\xa9kt, accompanied by a short, black-haired footman in yellowish-grey\r\ngaiters, and with a big cockade on his hat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT IS ENOUGH\r\n\r\n(1864)\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT FROM THE DIARY OF A DEAD ARTIST\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to myself, while my feet, treading unwillingly\r\nthe steep slope of the mountain, bore me downward toward the quiet\r\nriver; \xe2\x80\x9cit is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, as I inhaled the resinous scent of\r\nthe pine grove, to which the chill of approaching evening had imparted a\r\npeculiar potency and pungency; \xe2\x80\x9cit is enough,\xe2\x80\x9d I said once more, as I\r\nseated myself on a mossy hillock directly on the brink of the river and\r\ngazed at its dark, unhurried waves, above which a thick growth of reeds\r\nlifted their pale-green stalks.... \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough!--Have done with\r\ndreaming, with striving: \xe2\x80\x99tis high time to pull thyself together; \xe2\x80\x99tis\r\nhigh time to clutch thy head with both hands and bid thy heart be still.\r\nGive over pampering thyself with the sweet indulgence of indefinite but\r\ncaptivating sensations; give over running after every new form of\r\nbeauty; give over seizing every tremor of its delicate and powerful\r\npinions.--Everything is known, everything has been felt over and over\r\nagain many times already.... I am weary.--What care I that at this very\r\nmoment the dawn is suffusing the sky ever more and more broadly, like\r\nsome inflamed, all-conquering passion! What care I that two paces from\r\nme, amid the tranquillity and the tenderness and the gleam of evening,\r\nin the dewy depths of a motionless bush, a nightingale has suddenly\r\nburst forth in such magical notes as though there had never been any\r\nnightingales in the world before it, and as though it were the first to\r\nchant the first song of the first love! All that has been, has been, I\r\nrepeat; it has been recapitulated a thousand times--and when one\r\nremembers that all this will so continue for a whole eternity--as though\r\nto order, by law--one even grows vexed! Yes ... vexed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nEh, how I have suffered! Formerly such thoughts never entered my\r\nhead--formerly, in those happy days when I myself was wont to flame\r\nlike the glow of dawn, and to sing like the nightingale.--I must confess\r\nthat everything has grown obscure round about me, all life has withered.\r\nThe light which gives to its colours both significance and power--that\r\nlight which emanates from the heart of man--has become extinct within\r\nme.... No, it has not yet become extinct--but it is barely smouldering,\r\nwithout radiance and without warmth. I remember how one day, late at\r\nnight, in Moscow, I stepped up to the grated window of an ancient church\r\nand leaned against the uneven glass. It was dark under the low arches; a\r\nforgotten shrine-lamp flickered with a red flame in front of an ancient\r\nholy picture, and only the lips of the holy face were visible, stern and\r\nsuffering: mournful gloom closed in around and seemed to be preparing to\r\ncrush with its dull weight the faint ray of unnecessary light.... And in\r\nmy heart reign now the same sort of light and the same sort of gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAnd this I write to thee--to thee, my only and unforgettable friend; to\r\nthee, my dear companion,[31] whom I have left forever, but whom I shall\r\nnever cease to love until my life ends.... Alas! thou knowest what it\r\nwas that separated us. But I will not refer to that now. I have left\r\nthee ... but even here, in this remote nook, at this distance, in this\r\nexile, I am all permeated with thee, I am in thy power as of yore, as of\r\nyore I feel the sweet pressure of thy hands upon my bowed head!--Rising\r\nup for the last time, from the mute grave in which I now am lying, I run\r\na mild, much-moved glance over all my past, over all our past.... There\r\nis no hope and no return, but neither is there any bitterness in me, or\r\nregret; and clearer than the heavenly azure, purer than the first snows\r\non the mountain heights, are my beautiful memories.... They do not press\r\nupon me in throngs: they pass by in procession, like those muffled\r\nfigures of the Athenian god-born ones, which--dost thou remember?--we\r\nadmired so greatly on the ancient bas-reliefs of the Vatican....\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nI have just alluded to the light which emanates from the human heart and\r\nillumines everything which surrounds it.... I want to talk with thee\r\nabout that time when that gracious light burned in my heart.--Listen ...\r\nbut I imagine that thou art sitting in front of me, and gazing at me\r\nwith thine affectionate but almost severely-attentive eyes. O eyes never\r\nto be forgotten! On whom, on what are they now fixed? Who is receiving\r\ninto his soul thy glance--that glance which seems to flow from\r\nunfathomable depths, like those mysterious springs--like you both bright\r\nand dark--which well up at the very bottom of narrow valleys, beneath\r\noverhanging cliffs?... Listen.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt was at the end of March, just before the Feast of the Annunciation,\r\nshortly after I saw thee for the first time--and before I as yet\r\nsuspected what thou wert destined to become to me, although I already\r\nbore thee, silently and secretly in my heart.--I was obliged to cross\r\none of the largest rivers in Russia. The ice had not yet begun to move\r\nin it, but it seemed to have swollen up and turned dark; three days\r\npreviously a thaw had set in. The snow was melting round about\r\ndiligently but quietly; everywhere water was oozing out; in the light\r\nair a soundless breeze was roving. The same even, milky hue enveloped\r\nearth and sky: it was not a mist, but it was not light; not a single\r\nobject stood out from the general opacity; everything seemed both near\r\nand indistinct. Leaving my kib\xc3\xadtka far behind, I walked briskly over the\r\nriver-ice, and with the exception of the beat of my own footsteps, I\r\ncould hear nothing. I walked on, enveloped on all sides by the first\r\nstupor and breath of early spring ... and little by little augmenting\r\nwith every step, with every movement in advance, there gradually rose\r\nup and grew within me a certain joyous incomprehensible agitation.... It\r\ndrew me on, it hastened my pace--and so powerful were its transports,\r\nthat I came to a standstill at last and looked about me in surprise and\r\nquestioningly, as though desirous of detecting the outward cause of my\r\necstatic condition.... All was still, white, sunny; but I raised my\r\neyes: high above flocks of migratory birds were flying past.... \xe2\x80\x9cSpring!\r\nHail, Spring!\xe2\x80\x9d--I shouted in a loud voice. \xe2\x80\x9cHail, life and love and\r\nhappiness!\xe2\x80\x9d--And at that same instant, with sweetly-shattering force,\r\nsimilar to the flower of a cactus, there suddenly flared up within me\r\nthy image--flared up and stood there, enchantingly clear and\r\nbeautiful--and I understood that I loved thee, thee alone, that I was\r\nall filled with thee....\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nI think of thee ... and many other memories, other pictures rise up\r\nbefore me,--and thou art everywhere, on all the paths of my life I\r\nencounter thee.--Now there presents itself to me an old Russian garden\r\non the slope of a hill, illuminated by the last rays of the summer sun.\r\nFrom behind silvery poplars peeps forth the wooden roof of the\r\nmanor-house, with a slender wreath of crimson smoke hanging above the\r\nwhite chimney, and in the fence a wicket-gate stands open a crack, as\r\nthough some one had pulled it to with undecided hand. And I stand and\r\nwait, and gaze at that gate and at the sand on the garden paths; I\r\nwonder and I am moved: everything I see seems to me remarkable and new,\r\neverything is enveloped with an atmosphere of a sort of bright,\r\ncaressing mystery, and already I think I hear the swift rustle of\r\nfootsteps; and I stand, all alert and light, like a bird which has just\r\nfolded its wings and is poised ready to soar aloft again--and my heart\r\nflames and quivers in joyous dread before the imminent happiness which\r\nis flitting on in front....\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nThen I behold an ancient cathedral in a distant, beautiful land. The\r\nkneeling people are crowded close in rows; a prayerful chill, something\r\nsolemn and sad breathes forth from the lofty, bare vault, from the huge\r\npillars which branch upward.--Thou art standing by my side, speechless\r\nand unsympathetic, exactly as though thou wert a stranger to me; every\r\nfold of thy dark gown hangs motionless, as though sculptured; motionless\r\nlie the mottled reflections of the coloured windows at thy feet on the\r\nwell-worn flagstones.--And now, vigorously agitating the air dim with\r\nincense, inwardly agitating us, in a heavy surge the tones of the organ\r\nroll out; and thou hast turned pale and drawn thyself up; thy gaze has\r\ntouched me, has slipped on higher and is raised heavenward;--but it\r\nseems to me that only a deathless soul can look like that and with such\r\neyes....\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nNow another picture presents itself to me.--\xe2\x80\x99Tis not an ancient temple\r\nwhich crushes us with its stern magnificence: the low walls of a cosey\r\nlittle room separate us from the whole world.--What am I saying? We are\r\nalone--alone in all the world; except us two there is no living thing;\r\nbeyond those friendly walls lie darkness and death and emptiness. That\r\nis not the wind howling, that is not the rain streaming in floods; it is\r\nChaos wailing and groaning; it is its blind eyes weeping. But with us\r\nall is quiet and bright, and warm and gracious; something diverting,\r\nsomething childishly innocent is fluttering about like a butterfly, is\r\nit not? We nestle up to each other, we lean our heads together and both\r\nread a good book; I feel the slender vein in thy delicate temple\r\nbeating; I hear how thou art living, thou hearest how I am living, thy\r\nsmile is born upon my face before it comes on thine; thou silently\r\nrepliest to my silent question; thy thoughts, my thoughts, are like the\r\ntwo wings of one and the same bird drowned in the azure.... The last\r\npartitions have fallen--and our love has become so calm, so profound,\r\nevery breach has vanished so completely, leaving no trace behind it,\r\nthat we do not even wish to exchange a word, a glance.... We only wish\r\nto breathe, to breathe together, to live together, to be together, ...\r\nand not even to be conscious of the fact that we are together....\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nOr, in conclusion, there presents itself to me a clear September morning\r\nwhen thou and I were walking together through the deserted garden, as\r\nyet not wholly out of bloom, of an abandoned palace, on the bank of a\r\ngreat non-Russian river, beneath the soft radiance of a cloudless sky.\r\nOh, how shall I describe those sensations?--that endlessly-flowing\r\nriver, that absence of people, and tranquillity, and joy, and a certain\r\nintoxicating sadness, and the vibration of happiness, the unfamiliar,\r\nmonotonous town, the autumnal croaking of the daws in the tall, bright\r\ntrees--and those affectionate speeches and smiles and glances long and\r\nsoft, which pierce to the very bottom, and beauty,--the beauty in\r\nourselves, round about, everywhere;--it is beyond words. Oh, bench on\r\nwhich we sat in silence, with heads drooping low with happiness--I shall\r\nnever forget thee to my dying hour!--How charming were those rare\r\npassers-by with their gentle greeting and kind faces, and the large,\r\nquiet boats which floated past (on one of them--dost thou\r\nremember?--stood a horse gazing pensively at the water gliding by under\r\nits feet), the childish babble of the little waves inshore and the very\r\nbarking of distant dogs over the expanse of the river, the very shouts\r\nof the corpulent under-officer at the red-cheeked recruits drilling\r\nthere on one side, with their projecting elbows and their legs thrust\r\nforward like the legs of cranes!... We both felt that there never had\r\nbeen and never would be anything better in the world for us than those\r\nmoments--than all the rest.... But what comparisons are these! Enough\r\n... enough.... Alas! yes: it is enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nFor the last time I have surrendered myself to these memories, and I am\r\nparting from them irrevocably--as a miser, after gloating for the last\r\ntime upon his hoard, his gold, his bright treasure, buries it in the\r\ndamp earth; as the wick of an exhausted lamp, after flashing up in one\r\nlast brilliant flame, becomes covered with grey ashes. The little wild\r\nanimal has peered forth for the last time from his lair at the velvety\r\ngrass, at the fair little sun, at the blue, gracious waters,--and has\r\nretreated to the deepest level, and curled himself up in a ball, and\r\nfallen asleep. Will he have visions, if only in his sleep, of the fair\r\nlittle sun, and the grass, and the blue, gracious waters?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nSternly and ruthlessly does Fate lead each one of us--and only in the\r\nearly days do we, occupied with all sorts of accidents, nonsense,\r\nourselves, fail to feel her harsh hand.--So long as we are able to\r\ndeceive ourselves and are not ashamed to lie, it is possible to live and\r\nto hope without shame. The truth--not the full truth (there can be no\r\nquestion of that), but even that tiny fraction which is accessible to\r\nus--immediately closes our mouths, binds our hands, and reduces \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nnegation.\xe2\x80\x9d--The only thing that is then left for a man, in order to keep\r\nerect on his feet and not crumble to dust, not to become bemired in the\r\nooze of self-forgetfulness, is self-scorn; is to turn calmly away from\r\neverything and say: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough!\xe2\x80\x9d--and folding his useless arms on his\r\nempty breast to preserve the last, the sole merit which is accessible to\r\nhim, the merit of recognising his own insignificance; the merit to which\r\nPascal alludes, when, calling man a thinking reed, he says that if the\r\nentire universe were to crush him, he, that reed, would still be higher\r\nthan the universe because he would know that it is crushing him--while\r\nit would not know that. A feeble merit! Sad consolation! Try as thou\r\nmayest to permeate thyself with it, to believe in it,--oh, thou my poor\r\nbrother, whosoever thou mayest be!--thou canst not refute those ominous\r\nwords of the poet:\r\n\r\n    Life\xe2\x80\x99s but a walking shadow, a poor player\r\n    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage\r\n    And then is heard no more: it is a tale\r\n    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\n    Signifying nothing....[32]\r\n\r\nI have cited the verses from \xe2\x80\x9cMacbeth,\xe2\x80\x9d and those witches, phantoms,\r\nvisions have recurred to my mind.... Alas! it is not visions, not\r\nfantastic, subterranean powers that are terrible; the creations of\r\nHoffmann are not dreadful, under whatsoever form they may present\r\nthemselves.... The terrible thing is that there is nothing terrible,\r\nthat the very substance of life itself is petty, uninteresting--and\r\ninsipid to beggary. Having once become permeated with _this_\r\nconsciousness, having once tasted of _this_ wormwood, no honey will ever\r\nseem sweet--and even that loftiest, sweetest happiness, the happiness of\r\nlove, of complete friendship, of irrevocable devotion--even it loses\r\nall its charm; all its worth is annihilated by its own pettiness, its\r\nbrevity. Well, yes: a man has loved, he has burned, he has faltered\r\nwords about eternal bliss, about immortal enjoyments--and behold: it is\r\nlong, long since the last trace vanished of that worm which has eaten\r\nout the last remnants of his withered tongue. Thus late in autumn, on a\r\nfrosty day, when everything is lifeless and dumb in the last blades of\r\ngrass, on the verge of the denuded forest, the sun has but to emerge for\r\nan instant from the fog, to gaze intently at the chilled earth, and\r\nimmediately, from all sides, gnats rise up; they frolic in the warmth of\r\nhis rays, they bustle and jostle upward, downward, they circle round one\r\nanother.... The sun hides himself, and the gnats fall to the earth in a\r\nsoft rain--and there is an end to their momentary life.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut are there no great conceptions, no great words of consolation?\r\nNationality, right, liberty, humanity, art?\xe2\x80\x9d Yes; those words do exist,\r\nand many people live by them and for them. But nevertheless, I have an\r\nidea that if Shakspeare were to be born again he would find no occasion\r\nto disclaim his \xe2\x80\x9cHamlet,\xe2\x80\x9d his \xe2\x80\x9cLear.\xe2\x80\x9d His penetrating glance would not\r\ndescry anything new in human existence: the same motley and, in\r\nreality, incoherent picture would still unfold itself before him in its\r\ndisquieting monotony. The same frivolity, the same cruelty, the same\r\npressing demand for blood, gold, filth, the same stale pleasures, the\r\nsame senseless sufferings in the name of ... well, in the name of the\r\nsame nonsense which was ridiculed by Aristophanes three thousand years\r\nago, the same coarse lures to which the many-headed beast still yields\r\nas readily as ever--in a word, the same anxious skipping of the squirrel\r\nin the same old wheel, which has not even been renewed.... Shakspeare\r\nwould again make Lear repeat his harsh: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no guilty\r\nones\xe2\x80\x9d--which, in other words, signifies: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no just\xe2\x80\x9d--and he\r\nalso would say: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough!\xe2\x80\x9d and he also would turn away.--One thing\r\nonly: perhaps, in contrast to the gloomy, tragic tyrant Richard, the\r\nironical genius of the great poet would like to draw another, more\r\nup-to-date tyrant, who is almost ready to believe in his own virtue and\r\nrests calmly at night or complains of the over-dainty dinner at the same\r\ntime that his half-stifled victims are endeavouring to comfort\r\nthemselves by at least imagining him as Richard III. surrounded by the\r\nghosts of the people he has murdered....\r\n\r\nBut to what purpose?\r\n\r\nWhy demonstrate--and that by picking and weighing one\xe2\x80\x99s words, by\r\nrounding and polishing one\xe2\x80\x99s speech--why demonstrate to gnats that they\r\nreally are gnats?\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nBut art?... Beauty?... Yes, those are mighty words; they are, probably,\r\nmightier than those which I have mentioned above. The Venus of Melos,\r\nfor example, is more indubitable than the Roman law, or than the\r\nprinciples of 1789. Men may retort--and how many times have I heard\r\nthese retorts!--that beauty itself is also a matter of convention, that\r\nto the Chinese it presents itself in a totally different manner from\r\nwhat it does to the European.... But it is not the conventionality of\r\nart which disconcerts me; its perishableness, and again its\r\nperishableness,--its decay and dust--that is what deprives me of courage\r\nand of faith. Art, at any given moment, is, I grant, more powerful than\r\nNature itself, because in it there is neither symphony of Beethoven nor\r\npicture of Ruysdael nor poem of Goethe--and only dull-witted pedants or\r\nconscienceless babblers can still talk of art as a copy of Nature. But\r\nin the long run Nature is irresistible; she cannot be hurried, and\r\nsooner or later she will assert her rights. Unconsciously and infallibly\r\nobedient to law, she does not know art, as she does not know liberty, as\r\nshe does not know good; moving onward from eternity, transmitted from\r\neternity, she tolerates nothing immortal, nothing unchangeable.... Man\r\nis her child; but the human, the artificial is inimical to her,\r\nprecisely because she strives to be unchangeable and immortal. Man is\r\nthe child of Nature; but she is the universal mother, and she has no\r\npreferences: everything which exists in her bosom has arisen only for\r\nthe benefit of another and must, in due time, make way for that\r\nother--she creates by destroying, and it is a matter of perfect\r\nindifference to her what she creates, what she destroys, if only life be\r\nnot extirpated, if only death do not lose its rights.... And therefore\r\nshe as calmly covers with mould the divine visage of Phidias\xe2\x80\x99s Jupiter\r\nas she does a plain pebble, and delivers over to be devoured by the\r\ncontemned moth the most precious lines of Sophocles. Men, it is true,\r\nzealously aid her in her work of extermination; but is not the same\r\nelementary force,--is not the force of Nature shown in the finger of the\r\nbarbarian who senselessly shattered the radiant brow of Apollo, in the\r\nbeast-like howls with which he hurled the picture of Apelles into the\r\nfire? How are we poor men, poor artists, to come to an agreement with\r\nthis deaf and dumb force, blind from its birth, which does not even\r\ntriumph in its victories, but marches, ever marches on ahead, devouring\r\nall things? How are we to stand up against those heavy, coarse,\r\ninterminably and incessantly onrolling waves, how believe, in short, in\r\nthe significance and worth of those perishable images which we, in the\r\ndarkness, on the verge of the abyss, mould from the dust and for a mere\r\ninstant?\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nAll this is so ... but only the transitory is beautiful, Shakspeare has\r\nsaid; and Nature herself, in the unceasing play of her rising and\r\nvanishing forms, does not shun beauty. Is it not she who sedulously\r\nadorns the most momentary of her offspring--the petals of the flowers,\r\nthe wings of the butterfly--with such charming colours? Is it not she\r\nwho imparts to them such exquisite outlines? It is not necessary for\r\nbeauty to live forever in order to be immortal--one moment is sufficient\r\nfor it. That is so; that is just, I grant you--but only in cases where\r\nthere is no personality, where man is not, liberty is not: the faded\r\nwing of the butterfly comes back again, and a thousand years later, with\r\nthe selfsame wing of the selfsame butterfly, necessity sternly and\r\nregularly and impartially fulfils its round ... but man does not repeat\r\nhimself like the butterfly, and the work of his hands, his art, his free\r\ncreation once destroyed, is annihilated forever.... To him alone is it\r\ngiven to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d ... but it is strange and terrible to articulate: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\nare creators ... for an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d--as there once was, they say, a caliph\r\nfor an hour.--Therein lies our supremacy--and our curse: each one of\r\nthese \xe2\x80\x9ccreators\xe2\x80\x9d in himself--precisely he, not any one else, precisely\r\nthat ego--seems to have been created with deliberate intent, on a plan\r\npreviously designed; each one more or less dimly understands his\r\nsignificance, feels that he is akin to something higher, something\r\neternal--and he lives, he is bound to live in the moment and for the\r\nmoment.[33] Sit in the mud, my dear fellow, and strive toward\r\nheaven!--The greatest among us are precisely those who are the most\r\nprofoundly conscious of all of that fundamental contradiction; but in\r\nthat case the question arises,--are the words \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest, great\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nappropriate?\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nBut what shall be said of those to whom, despite a thorough desire to do\r\nso, one cannot apply those appellations even in the sense which is\r\nattributed to them by the feeble human tongue?--What shall be said of\r\nthe ordinary, commonplace, second-rate, third-rate toilers--whoever they\r\nmay be--statesmen, learned men, artists--especially artists? How force\r\nthem to shake off their dumb indolence, their dejected perplexity, how\r\ndraw them once more to the field of battle, if once the thought as to\r\nthe vanity of everything human, of every activity which sets for itself\r\na higher aim than the winning of daily bread, has once crept into their\r\nheads? By what wreaths are they lured on--they, for whom laurels and\r\nthorns have become equally insignificant? Why should they again subject\r\nthemselves to the laughter of \xe2\x80\x9cthe cold throng\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cthe condemnation\r\nof the dunce,\xe2\x80\x9d--of the old dunce who cannot forgive them for having\r\nturned away from the former idols; of the young dunce who demands that\r\nthey shall immediately go down on their knees in his company, that they\r\nshould lie prone before new, just-discovered idols? Why shall they\r\nbetake themselves again to that rag-fair of phantoms, to that\r\nmarket-place where both the seller and the buyer cheat each other\r\nequally, where everything is so noisy, so loud--and yet so poor and\r\nworthless? Why \xe2\x80\x9cwith exhaustion in their bones\xe2\x80\x9d shall they interweave\r\nthemselves again with that world where the nations, like peasant urchins\r\non a festival day, flounder about in the mud for the sake of a handful\r\nof empty nuts, or admire with gaping mouths the wretched woodcuts,\r\ndecorated with tinsel gold,--with that world where they had no right to\r\nlife while they lived in it, and, deafening themselves with their own\r\nshouts, each one hastens with convulsive speed to a goal which he\r\nneither knows nor understands? No ... no.... It is enough ... enough ...\r\nenough!\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n... The rest is silence.[34] ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG\r\n\r\n(1866)\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if we can admit the possibility of the supernatural, the\r\npossibility of its intervention in real life,--then allow me to inquire,\r\nwhat r\xc3\xb4le is sound judgment bound to play after this?\xe2\x80\x9d--shouted Ant\xc3\xb3n\r\nStep\xc3\xa1nitch, crossing his arms on his stomach.\r\n\r\nAnt\xc3\xb3n Step\xc3\xa1nitch had held the rank of State Councillor,[35] had served\r\nin some wonderful department, and, as his speech was interlarded with\r\npauses and was slow and uttered in a bass voice, he enjoyed universal\r\nrespect. Not long before the date of our story, \xe2\x80\x9cthe good-for-nothing\r\nlittle Order of St. Stanislas had been stuck on him,\xe2\x80\x9d as those who\r\nenvied him expressed it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is perfectly just,\xe2\x80\x9d--remarked Skvor\xc3\xa9vitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one will dispute that,\xe2\x80\x9d--added Kinar\xc3\xa9vitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI assent also,\xe2\x80\x9d--chimed in, in falsetto, from a corner the master of\r\nthe house, Mr. Finopl\xc3\xa9ntoff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I, I must confess, cannot assent, because something supernatural\r\nhas happened to me,\xe2\x80\x9d--said a man of medium stature and middle age, with\r\na protruding abdomen and a bald spot, who had been sitting silent before\r\nthe stove up to that moment. The glances of all present in the room were\r\nturned upon him with curiosity and surprise--and silence reigned.\r\n\r\nThis man was a landed proprietor of Kal\xc3\xbaga, not wealthy, who had\r\nrecently come to Petersburg. He had once served in the hussars, had\r\ngambled away his property, resigned from the service and settled down in\r\nthe country. The recent agricultural changes had cut off his revenues,\r\nand he had betaken himself to the capital in search of a snug little\r\nposition. He possessed no abilities, and had no influential connections;\r\nbut he placed great reliance on the friendship of an old comrade in the\r\nservice, who had suddenly, without rhyme or reason, become a person of\r\nimportance, and whom he had once aided to administer a sound thrashing\r\nto a card-sharper. Over and above that he counted upon his own luck--and\r\nit had not betrayed him; several days later he obtained the post of\r\ninspector of government storehouses, a profitable, even honourable\r\nposition which did not require extraordinary talents: the storehouses\r\nthemselves existed only in contemplation, and no one even knew with\r\ncertainty what they were to contain,--but they had been devised as a\r\nmeasure of governmental economy.\r\n\r\nAnt\xc3\xb3n Step\xc3\xa1nitch was the first to break the general silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, my dear sir?\xe2\x80\x9d--he began. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you seriously assert that something\r\nsupernatural--I mean to say, incompatible with the laws of nature--has\r\nhappened to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d--returned \xe2\x80\x9cmy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d whose real name was Porf\xc3\xadry\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIncompatible with the laws of nature?\xe2\x80\x9d--energetically repeated Ant\xc3\xb3n\r\nStep\xc3\xa1nitch, who evidently liked that phrase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPrecisely ... yes; precisely the sort of thing you allude to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is astonishing! What think you, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d--Ant\xc3\xb3n Step\xc3\xa1nitch\r\nendeavoured to impart to his features an ironical expression, but\r\nwithout result--or, to speak more accurately, the only result was to\r\nproduce the effect that Mr. State Councillor smelt a bad odour.--\xe2\x80\x9cWill\r\nnot you be so kind, my dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--he went on, addressing the landed\r\nproprietor from Kal\xc3\xbaga,--\xe2\x80\x9cas to communicate to us the particulars of\r\nsuch a curious event?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Certainly!\xe2\x80\x9d--replied the landed proprietor, and moving forward\r\nto the middle of the room in an easy manner he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\nI have, gentlemen, as you are probably aware,--or as you may not be\r\naware,--a small estate in Kozy\xc3\xb3l County. I formerly derived some profit\r\nfrom it--but now, of course, nothing but unpleasantness is to be\r\nanticipated. However, let us put politics aside! Well, sir, on that same\r\nestate I have a \xe2\x80\x9cwee little\xe2\x80\x9d manor: a vegetable garden, as is proper, a\r\ntiny pond with little carp, and some sort of buildings--well, and a\r\nsmall wing for my own sinful body.... I am a bachelor. So, sir, one\r\nday--about six years ago--I had returned home rather late; I had been\r\nplaying cards at a neighbour\xe2\x80\x99s house--but I beg you to observe, I was\r\nnot tipsy, as the expression goes. I undressed, got into bed, and blew\r\nout the light. And just imagine, gentlemen; no sooner had I blown out\r\nthe light, than something began to rummage under my bed! Is it a rat? I\r\nthought. No, it was not a rat: it clawed and fidgeted and scratched\r\nitself.... At last it began to flap its ears!\r\n\r\nIt was a dog--that was clear. But where had the dog come from? I keep\r\nnone myself. \xe2\x80\x9cCan some stray animal have run in?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. I called to\r\nmy servant; his name is F\xc3\xadlka. The man entered with a candle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this,\xe2\x80\x9d--says I,--\xe2\x80\x9cmy good F\xc3\xadlka? How lax thou art! A dog has\r\nintruded himself under my bed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dog?\xe2\x80\x9d--says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d--says I;--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s thy affair--not to allow thy\r\nmaster to be disturbed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy F\xc3\xadlka bent down, and began to pass the candle about under the bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d--says he,--\xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no dog here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI bent down also; in fact there was no dog.... Here was a marvel! I\r\nturned my eyes on F\xc3\xadlka: he was smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFool,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I to him,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat art thou grinning about? When thou didst\r\nopen the door the dog probably took and sneaked out into the anteroom.\r\nBut thou, gaper, didst notice nothing, because thou art eternally\r\nasleep. Can it be that thou thinkest I am drunk?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe attempted to reply, but I drove him out, curled myself up in a ring,\r\nand heard nothing more that night.\r\n\r\nBut on the following night--just imagine!--the same thing was repeated.\r\nNo sooner had I blown out the light than it began to claw and flap its\r\nears. Again I summoned F\xc3\xadlka, again he looked under the bed--again\r\nnothing! I sent him away, blew out the light--phew, damn it! there was\r\nthe dog still. And a dog it certainly was: I could hear it breathing and\r\nrummaging in its hair with its teeth in search of fleas so plainly!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cF\xc3\xadlka!\xe2\x80\x9d--says I,--\xe2\x80\x9ccome hither without a light!\xe2\x80\x9d... He entered....\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now,\xe2\x80\x9d--says I, \xe2\x80\x9cdost thou hear?...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he. I could not see him, but I felt that the fellow was\r\nquailing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat dost thou command me to make of it, Porf\xc3\xadry Kap\xc3\xadtonitch?... \xe2\x80\x99Tis\r\nan instigation of the Evil One!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou art a lewd fellow; hold thy tongue with thy instigation of the\r\nEvil One.\xe2\x80\x9d... But the voices of both of us were like those of birds,\r\nand we were shaking as though in a fever--in the darkness. I lighted a\r\ncandle: there was no dog, and no noise whatever--only F\xc3\xadlka and I as\r\nwhite as clay. And I must inform you, gentlemen--you can believe me or\r\nnot--but from that night forth for the space of six weeks the same thing\r\nwent on. At last I even got accustomed to it and took to extinguishing\r\nmy light because I cannot sleep with a light. \xe2\x80\x9cLet him fidget!\xe2\x80\x9d I\r\nthought. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t harm me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut--I see--that you do not belong to the cowardly squad,\xe2\x80\x9d--interrupted\r\nAnt\xc3\xb3n Step\xc3\xa1nitch, with a half-scornful, half-condescending laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nhussar is immediately perceptible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not be frightened at you, in any case,\xe2\x80\x9d--said Porf\xc3\xadry\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch, and for a moment he really did look like a hussar.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nlisten further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA neighbour came to me, the same one with whom I was in the habit of\r\nplaying cards. He dined with me on what God had sent, and lost fifty\r\nrubles to me for his visit; night was drawing on--it was time for him to\r\ngo. But I had calculations of my own:--\xe2\x80\x9cStop and spend the night with\r\nme, Vas\xc3\xadly Vas\xc3\xadlitch; to-morrow thou wilt win it back, God willing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy Vas\xc3\xadly Vas\xc3\xadlitch pondered and pondered--and stayed. I ordered a bed\r\nto be placed for him in my own chamber.... Well, sir, we went to bed,\r\nsmoked, chattered,--chiefly about the feminine sex, as is fitting in\r\nbachelor society,--and laughed, as a matter of course. I look; Vas\xc3\xadly\r\nVas\xc3\xadlitch has put out his candle and has turned his back on me; that\r\nsignifies: \xe2\x80\x9c_Schlafen Sie wohl._\xe2\x80\x9d I waited a little and extinguished my\r\ncandle also. And imagine: before I had time to think to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\r\nsort of performance will there be now?\xe2\x80\x9d my dear little animal began to\r\nmake a row. And that was not all; he crawled out from under the bed,\r\nwalked across the room, clattering his claws on the floor, waggling his\r\nears, and suddenly collided with a chair which stood by the side of\r\nVas\xc3\xadly Vas\xc3\xadlitch\xe2\x80\x99s bed!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPorf\xc3\xadry Kap\xc3\xadtonitch,\xe2\x80\x9d--says Vas\xc3\xadly Vas\xc3\xadlitch, and in such an\r\nindifferent voice, you know,--\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that thou hadst taken to\r\nkeeping a dog. What sort of an animal is it--a setter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no dog,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I,--\xe2\x80\x9cand I never have had one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou hast not indeed! But what\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.--\xe2\x80\x9cSee here now; light the candle and thou wilt\r\nfind out for thyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt isn\xe2\x80\x99t a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nVas\xc3\xadly Vas\xc3\xadlitch turned over in bed.--\xe2\x80\x9cBut thou art jesting, damn it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not jesting.\xe2\x80\x9d--I hear him go scratch, scratch with a match, and\r\nthat thing does not stop, but scratches its side. The flame flashed up\r\n... and basta! There was not a trace of a dog! Vas\xc3\xadly Vas\xc3\xadlitch stared\r\nat me--and I stared at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a trick is this?\xe2\x80\x9d--said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I,--\xe2\x80\x9cthis is such a trick that if thou wert to set Socrates\r\nhimself on one side and Frederick the Great on the other even they\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make head or tail of it.\xe2\x80\x9d--And thereupon I told him all in\r\ndetail. Up jumped my Vas\xc3\xadly Vas\xc3\xadlitch as though he had been singed! He\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into his boots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHorses!\xe2\x80\x9d--he yelled--\xe2\x80\x9chorses!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began to argue with him, but in vain. He simply groaned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t stay,\xe2\x80\x9d--he shouted,--\xe2\x80\x9cnot a minute!--Of course, after this,\r\nthou art a doomed man!--Horses!...\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I prevailed upon him. Only his bed was dragged out into another\r\nroom--and night-lights were lighted everywhere. In the morning, at tea,\r\nhe recovered his dignity; he began to give me advice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThou shouldst try absenting thyself from the house for several days,\r\nPorf\xc3\xadry Kap\xc3\xadtonitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said: \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps that vile thing would leave\r\nthee.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I must tell you that he--that neighbour of mine--had a capacious\r\nmind! he worked his mother-in-law so famously among other things: he\r\npalmed off a note of hand on her; which signifies that he chose the most\r\nvulnerable moment! She became like silk: she gave him a power of\r\nattorney over all her property--what more would you have? But that was a\r\ngreat affair--to twist his mother-in-law round his finger--wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it,\r\nhey? Judge for yourselves. But he went away from me somewhat\r\ndiscontented; I had punished him to the extent of another hundred\r\nrubles. He even swore at me: \xe2\x80\x9cThou art ungrateful,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthou hast\r\nno feeling;\xe2\x80\x9d but how was I to blame for that? Well, this is in\r\nparenthesis--but I took his suggestion under consideration. That same\r\nday I drove off to town and established myself in an inn, with an\r\nacquaintance, an old man of the Old Ritualist sect.[36]\r\n\r\nHe was a worthy old man, although a trifle harsh, because of\r\nloneliness: his whole family were dead. Only he did not favour tobacco\r\nat all,[37] and felt a great loathing for dogs; I believe, for example,\r\nthat rather than admit a dog into the room he would have rent himself in\r\ntwain! \xe2\x80\x9cFor how is it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d--he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere in my room, on the\r\nwall, the Sovereign Lady herself deigns to dwell;[38] and shall a filthy\r\ndog thrust his accursed snout in there?\xe2\x80\x9d--That was ignorance, of course!\r\nHowever, this is my opinion: if any man has been vouchsafed wisdom, let\r\nhim hold to it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are a great philosopher, I see,\xe2\x80\x9d--interrupted Ant\xc3\xb3n Step\xc3\xa1nitch\r\nagain, with the same laugh as before.\r\n\r\nThis time Porf\xc3\xadry Kap\xc3\xadtonitch even scowled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of a philosopher I am no one knows,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said as his\r\nmoustache twitched in a surly manner:--\xe2\x80\x9cbut I would gladly take you as a\r\npupil.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all fairly bored our eyes into Ant\xc3\xb3n Step\xc3\xa1nitch; each one of us\r\nexpected an arrogant retort or at least a lightning glance.... But Mr.\r\nState Councillor altered his smile from scorn to indifference, then\r\nyawned, dangled his foot--and that was all!\r\n\r\nSo then, I settled down at that old man\xe2\x80\x99s house--[went on Porf\xc3\xadry\r\nKap\xc3\xadtonitch].--He assigned me a room \xe2\x80\x9cfor acquaintance\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d sake,--not of\r\nthe best; he himself lodged there also, behind a partition--and that was\r\nall I required. But what tortures I did undergo! The chamber was small,\r\nit was hot, stifling, and there were flies, and such sticky ones; in the\r\ncorner was a remarkably large case for images, with ancient holy\r\npictures; their garments were dim and puffed out; the air was fairly\r\ninfected with olive-oil, and some sort of a spice in addition; on the\r\nbedstead were two down beds; if you moved a pillow, out ran a cockroach\r\nfrom beneath it.... I drank an incredible amount of tea, out of sheer\r\ntedium--it was simply horrible! I got into bed; it was impossible to\r\nsleep.--And on the other side of the partition my host was sighing and\r\ngrunting and reciting his prayers. I heard him begin to snore--and very\r\nlightly and courteously, in old-fashioned style. I had long since\r\nextinguished my candle--only the shrine-lamp was twinkling in front of\r\nthe holy pictures.... A hindrance, of course! So I took and rose up\r\nsoftly, in my bare feet: I reached up to the lamp and blew it out....\r\nNothing happened.--\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought: \xe2\x80\x9cthis means that he won\xe2\x80\x99t make a\r\nfuss in the house of strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d... But no sooner had I lain down on\r\nthe bed than the row began again! The thing clawed, and scratched\r\nhimself and flapped his ears ... well, just as I wanted him to. Good! I\r\nlay there and waited to see what would happen. I heard the old man wake\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he,--\xe2\x80\x9chey there, master?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s wanted?\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas it thou who didst put out the shrine-lamp?\xe2\x80\x9d--And without awaiting\r\nmy reply, he suddenly began to mumble:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that? What\xe2\x80\x99s that? A dog? A dog? Akh, thou damned Nikonian!\xe2\x80\x9d[39]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit, old man,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I,--\xe2\x80\x9cbefore thou cursest; but it would be\r\nbetter for thee to come hither thyself. Things deserving of wonder are\r\ngoing on here,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.\r\n\r\nThe old man fussed about behind the partition and entered my room with a\r\ncandle, a slender one, of yellow wax; and I was amazed as I looked at\r\nhim! He was all bristling, with shaggy ears and vicious eyes like those\r\nof a polecat; on his head was a small skull-cap of white felt; his beard\r\nreached to his girdle and was white also; and he had on a waistcoat with\r\nbrass buttons over his shirt, and fur boots on his feet, and he\r\ndisseminated an odour of juniper. In that condition he went up to the\r\nholy pictures, crossed himself thrice with two fingers[40] lighted the\r\nshrine-lamp, crossed himself again, and turning to me, merely grunted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExplain thyself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThereupon, without the least delay, I communicated to him all the\r\ncircumstances. The old man listened to all my explanations without\r\nuttering the smallest word; he simply kept shaking his head. Then he sat\r\ndown on my bed, still maintaining silence. He scratched his breast, the\r\nback of his head, and other places, and still remained silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Feod\xc3\xbal Iv\xc3\xa1nitch,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is thy opinion: is this some\r\nsort of visitation of the Evil One, thinkest thou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man stared at me.--\xe2\x80\x9cA pretty thing thou hast invented! A\r\nvisitation of the Evil One, forsooth! \xe2\x80\x99Twould be all right at thy house,\r\nthou tobacco-user,--but \xe2\x80\x99tis quite another thing here! Only consider how\r\nmany holy things there are here! And thou must needs have a visitation\r\nof the devil!--And if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that, what is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe old man relapsed into silence, scratched himself again, and at last\r\nhe said, but in a dull sort of way, because his moustache kept crawling\r\ninto his mouth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo thou to the town of By\xc3\xa9leff. There is only one man who can help\r\nthee. And that man dwells in By\xc3\xa9leff;[41] he is one of our people. If\r\nhe takes a fancy to help thee, that\xe2\x80\x99s thy good luck; if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take\r\na fancy,--so it must remain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how am I to find him?\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can give thee directions,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he;--\xe2\x80\x9conly why dost thou call this\r\na visitation of the devil? \xe2\x80\x99Tis a vision, or a sign; but thou wilt not\r\nbe able to comprehend it; \xe2\x80\x99tis not within thy flight. And now lie down\r\nand sleep under Christ\xe2\x80\x99s protection, dear little father; I will fumigate\r\nwith incense; and in the morning we will take counsel together. The\r\nmorning is wiser than the evening, thou knowest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, sir, and we did take counsel together in the morning--only I came\r\nnear choking to death with that same incense. And the old man instructed\r\nme after this wise: that when I had reached By\xc3\xa9leff I was to go to the\r\npublic square, and in the second shop on the right inquire for a certain\r\nProkh\xc3\xb3ritch; and having found Prokh\xc3\xb3ritch, I was to hand him a document.\r\nAnd the whole document consisted of a scrap of paper, on which was\r\nwritten the following: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and\r\nof the Holy Spirit, Amen. To Sergy\xc3\xa9i Prokh\xc3\xb3ritch Perv\xc3\xbashin. Trust this\r\nman. Feod\xc3\xbaly Iv\xc3\xa1novitch.\xe2\x80\x9d And below: \xe2\x80\x9cSend some cabbages, for God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked the old man, and without further ado ordered my tarant\xc3\xa1s to be\r\nharnessed, and set off for By\xc3\xa9leff. For I argued in this way: admitting\r\nthat my nocturnal visitor did not cause me much grief, still,\r\nnevertheless, it was not quite decorous for a nobleman and an\r\nofficer--what do you think about it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you really go to By\xc3\xa9leff?\xe2\x80\x9d--whispered Mr. Finopl\xc3\xa9ntoff.\r\n\r\nI did, straight to By\xc3\xa9leff. I went to the square, and inquired in the\r\nsecond shop on the right for Prokh\xc3\xb3ritch. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there such a man?\xe2\x80\x9d--I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is,\xe2\x80\x9d--I was told.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where does he live?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the Ok\xc3\xa1, beyond the vegetable-gardens.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn whose house?\xe2\x80\x9d[42]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI wended my way to the Ok\xc3\xa1, searched out his house, that is to say, not\r\nactually a house, but a downright hovel. I beheld a man in a patched\r\nblue overcoat and a tattered cap,--of the petty burgher class, judging\r\nby his appearance,--standing with his back to me, and digging in his\r\ncabbage-garden.--I went up to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you such and such a one?\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.\r\n\r\nHe turned round,--and to tell you the truth, such piercing eyes I have\r\nnever seen in all my life. But his whole face was no bigger than one\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfist; his beard was wedge-shaped, and his lips were sunken: he was an\r\naged man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am he,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said.--\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you wanta?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I;--\xe2\x80\x9cthis is what I wanta,\xe2\x80\x9d--and I placed the\r\ndocument in his hand. He gazed at me very intently, and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease come into the house; I cannot read without my spectacles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell, sir, he and I went into his kennel--actually, a regular kennel;\r\npoor, bare, crooked; it barely held together. On the wall was a holy\r\npicture of ancient work,[43] as black as a coal; only the whites of the\r\neyes were fairly burning in the faces of the holy people. He took some\r\nround iron spectacles from a small table, placed them on his nose,\r\nperused the writing, and through his spectacles again scrutinised me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have need of me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the fact.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you have, then make your statement, and I will\r\nlisten.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd just imagine; he sat down, and pulling a checked handkerchief from\r\nhis pocket, he spread it out on his knees--and the handkerchief was full\r\nof holes--and gazed at me as solemnly as though he had been a\r\nsenator,[44] or some minister or other; and did not ask me to sit down.\r\nAnd what was still more astonishing, I suddenly felt myself growing\r\ntimid, so timid ... simply, my soul sank into my heels. He pierced me\r\nthrough and through with his eyes, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all there is to be said!\r\nBut I recovered my self-possession, and narrated to him my whole story.\r\nHe remained silent for a while, shrank together, mowed with his lips,\r\nand then began to interrogate me, still as though he were a senator, so\r\nmajestically and without haste. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your name?\xe2\x80\x9d--he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow old\r\nare you? Who were your parents? Are you a bachelor or married?\xe2\x80\x9d--Then he\r\nbegan to mow with his lips again, frowned, thrust out his finger and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo reverence to the holy image of the honourable saints of\r\nSolov\xc3\xa9tzk,[45] Z\xc3\xb3sim and Sav\xc3\xa1ty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made a reverence to the earth, and did not rise to my feet; such awe\r\nand submission did I feel for that man that I believe I would have\r\ninstantly done anything whatsoever he might have ordered me!... I see\r\nthat you are smiling, gentlemen; but I was in no mood for laughing then,\r\nby Heaven I was not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--he said at last.--\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible to help you. This has\r\nnot been sent to you by way of punishment, but as a warning; it\r\nsignifies that you are being looked after; some one is praying earnestly\r\nfor you. Go now to the bazaar and buy yourself a bitch, which you must\r\nkeep by you day and night, without ceasing. Your visions will cease, and\r\nyour dog will prove necessary to you into the bargain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA flash of light seemed suddenly to illuminate me; how those words did\r\nplease me! I made obeisance to Prokh\xc3\xb3ritch, and was on the point of\r\ndeparting, but remembered that it was impossible for me not to show him\r\nmy gratitude; I drew a three-ruble note from my pocket. But he put aside\r\nmy hand and said to me:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGive it to our chapel, or to the poor, for this service is gratis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain I made him an obeisance, nearly to the girdle, and immediately\r\nmarched off to the bazaar. And fancy, no sooner had I begun to approach\r\nthe shops when behold, a man in a frieze cloak advanced to meet me, and\r\nunder his arm he carried a setter bitch, two months old, with\r\nlight-brown hair, a white muzzle, and white fore paws.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalt!\xe2\x80\x9d said I to the man in the frieze cloak; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will you take for\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo rubles in silver.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake three!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe man was astonished, and thought the gentleman had lost his mind--but\r\nI threw a banknote in his teeth, seized the bitch in my arms, and\r\nrushed to my tarant\xc3\xa1s. The coachman harnessed up the horses briskly, and\r\nthat same evening I was at home. The dog sat on my lap during the whole\r\njourney--and never uttered a sound; but I kept saying to her:\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTres\xc3\xb3rushko! Tres\xc3\xb3rushko!\xe2\x80\x9d I immediately gave her food and water,\r\nordered straw to be brought, put her to bed, and dashed into bed myself.\r\nI blew out the light; darkness reigned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome now, begin!\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.--Silence.--\xe2\x80\x9cDo begin, thou thus and\r\nso!\xe2\x80\x9d--Not a sound. It was laughable. I began to take courage.--\xe2\x80\x9cCome\r\nnow, begin, thou thus and so, and \xe2\x80\x99tother thing!\xe2\x80\x9d But nothing\r\nhappened--there was a complete lull! The only thing to be heard was the\r\nbitch breathing hard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cF\xc3\xadlka!\xe2\x80\x9d--I shouted;--\xe2\x80\x9cF\xc3\xadlka! Come hither, stupid man!\xe2\x80\x9d--He\r\nentered.--\xe2\x80\x9cDost thou hear the dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, master,\xe2\x80\x9d--said he,--\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything,\xe2\x80\x9d--and began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd thou wilt not hear it again forever! Here\xe2\x80\x99s half a ruble for thee\r\nfor vodka!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPlease let me kiss your hand,\xe2\x80\x9d--said the fool, and crawled to me in the\r\ndark.... My joy was great, I can tell you!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was that the end of it all?\xe2\x80\x9d--asked Ant\xc3\xb3n Step\xc3\xa1nitch, no longer\r\nironically.\r\n\r\nThe visions did cease, it is true--and there were no disturbances of any\r\nsort--but wait, that was not the end of the whole matter. My\r\nTres\xc3\xb3rushko began to grow, and turned out a cunning rogue. Thick-tailed,\r\nheavy, flop-eared, with drooping dewlaps, she was a regular\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ctake-advance,\xe2\x80\x9d--a thoroughgoing good setter. And moreover, she became\r\ngreatly attached to me. Hunting is bad in our parts,--well, but as I had\r\nset up a dog I had to supply myself with a gun also. I began to roam\r\nabout the surrounding country with my Tres\xc3\xb3r; sometimes I would knock\r\nover a hare (my heavens, how she did course those hares!), and sometimes\r\na quail or a duck. But the chief point was that Tres\xc3\xb3r never, never\r\nstrayed a step away from me. Wherever I went, there she went also; I\r\neven took her to the bath with me--truly! One of our young gentlewomen\r\nundertook to eject me from her drawing-room on account of Tres\xc3\xb3r; but I\r\nraised such a row that I smashed some of her window-panes!\r\n\r\nWell, sir, one day--it happened in summer.... And I must tell you that\r\nthere was such a drought that no one could recall its like; the air was\r\nfull of something which was neither smoke nor fog; there was an odour of\r\nburning, and mist, and the sun was like a red-hot cannon-ball; and the\r\ndust was such that one could not leave off sneezing! People went about\r\nwith their mouths gaping open, just like crows.\r\n\r\nIt bored me to sit at home constantly in complete undress, behind closed\r\nshutters; and by the way, the heat was beginning to moderate.... And\r\nso, gentlemen, I set off afoot to the house of one of my neighbours.\r\nThis neighbour of mine lived about a verst from me,--and was really a\r\nbenevolent lady. She was still young and blooming, and of the most\r\nattractive exterior; only she had a fickle disposition. But that is no\r\ndetriment in the feminine sex; it even affords pleasure.... So, then, I\r\ntrudged to her porch--and that trip seemed very salt to me! Well, I\r\nthought, Nimfod\xc3\xb3ra Semy\xc3\xb3novna will regale me with bilberry-water, and\r\nother refreshments--and I had already grasped the door-handle when,\r\nsuddenly, around the corner of the servants\xe2\x80\x99 cottage there arose a\r\ntrampling of feet, a squealing and shouting of small boys.... I looked\r\nround. O Lord, my God! Straight toward me was dashing a huge, reddish\r\nbeast, which at first sight I did not recognise as a dog; its jaws were\r\ngaping, its eyes were blood-shot, its hair stood on end.... Before I\r\ncould take breath the monster leaped upon the porch, elevated itself on\r\nits hind legs, and fell straight on my breast. What do you think of that\r\nsituation? I was swooning with fright, and could not lift my arms; I was\r\ncompletely stupefied; ... all I could see were the white tusks right at\r\nthe end of my nose, the red tongue all swathed in foam. But at that\r\nmoment another dark body soared through the air in front of me, like a\r\nball--it was my darling Tres\xc3\xb3r coming to my rescue; and she went at\r\nthat beast\xe2\x80\x99s throat like a leech! The beast rattled hoarsely in the\r\nthroat, gnashed its teeth, staggered back.... With one jerk I tore open\r\nthe door, and found myself in the anteroom. I stood there, beside myself\r\nwith terror, threw my whole body against the lock, and listened to a\r\ndesperate battle which was in progress on the porch. I began to shout,\r\nto call for help; every one in the house took alarm. Nimfod\xc3\xb3ra\r\nSemy\xc3\xb3novna ran up with hair unbraided; voices clamoured in the\r\ncourtyard--and suddenly there came a cry: \xe2\x80\x9cHold him, hold him, lock the\r\ngate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened the door,--just a crack,--and looked. The monster was no longer\r\non the porch. People were rushing in disorder about the courtyard,\r\nflourishing their arms, picking up billets of wood from the ground--just\r\nas though they had gone mad. \xe2\x80\x9cTo the village! It has run to the\r\nvillage!\xe2\x80\x9d shrieked shrilly a peasant-woman in a pointed coronet\r\nhead-dress of unusual dimensions, thrusting her head through a\r\ngarret-window. I emerged from the house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Tres\xc3\xb3r?\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.--And at that moment I caught sight of my\r\nsaviour. She was walking away from the gate, limping, all bitten, and\r\ncovered with blood....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what was it, after all?\xe2\x80\x9d--I asked the people, as they went circling\r\nround the courtyard like crazy folk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA mad dog!\xe2\x80\x9d--they answered me, \xe2\x80\x9cbelonging to the Count; it has been\r\nroving about here since yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had a neighbour, a Count; he had introduced some very dreadful dogs\r\nfrom over-sea. My knees gave way beneath me; I hastened to the mirror\r\nand looked to see whether I had been bitten. No; God be thanked, nothing\r\nwas visible; only, naturally, my face was all green; but Nimfod\xc3\xb3ra\r\nSemy\xc3\xb3novna was lying on the couch, and clucking like a hen. And that was\r\neasily to be understood: in the first place, nerves; in the second\r\nplace, sensibility. But she came to herself, and asked me in a very\r\nlanguid way: was I alive? I told her that I was, and that Tres\xc3\xb3r was my\r\nsaviour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat nobility! And I suppose the mad dog smothered\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I,--\xe2\x80\x9cit did not smother her, but it wounded her seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she,--\xe2\x80\x9cin that case, she must be shot this very moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I;--\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t agree to that; I shall try to\r\ncure her.\xe2\x80\x9d ...\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Tres\xc3\xb3r began to scratch at the door; I started to open\r\nit for her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh,\xe2\x80\x9d--cried she,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat are you doing? Why, she will bite us all\r\ndreadfully!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPardon me,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I,--\xe2\x80\x9cthe poison does not take effect so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAkh,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she,--\xe2\x80\x9chow is that possible? Why, you have gone out of your\r\nmind!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNimf\xc3\xb3tchka,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I,--\xe2\x80\x9ccalm thyself; listen to reason....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut all at once she began to scream: \xe2\x80\x9cGo away; go away this instant with\r\nyour disgusting dog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will go,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstantly,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she,--\xe2\x80\x9cthis very second! Take thyself off,\r\nbrigand,\xe2\x80\x9d--said she,--\xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t dare ever to show yourself in my sight\r\nagain. Thou mightest go mad thyself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d--said I; \xe2\x80\x9conly give me an equipage, for I am afraid\r\nto go home on foot now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe riveted her eyes on me. \xe2\x80\x9cGive, give him a calash, a carriage, a\r\ndrozhky, whatever he wants,--anything, for the sake of getting rid of\r\nhim as quickly as possible. Akh, what eyes! akh, what eyes he has!\xe2\x80\x9d--And\r\nwith these words she flew out of the room, dealing a maid who was\r\nentering a box on the ear,--and I heard her go off into another fit of\r\nhysterics.--And you may believe me or not, gentlemen, but from that day\r\nforth I broke off all acquaintance with Nimfod\xc3\xb3ra Semy\xc3\xb3novna; and,\r\ntaking all things into mature consideration, I cannot but add that for\r\nthat circumstance also I owe my friend Tres\xc3\xb3r a debt of gratitude until\r\nI lie down in my coffin.\r\n\r\nWell, sir, I ordered a calash to be harnessed, placed Tres\xc3\xb3r in it, and\r\ndrove off home with her. At home I looked her over, washed her wounds,\r\nand thought to myself: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take her to-morrow, as soon as it is light,\r\nto the wizard in Efr\xc3\xa9m County. Now this wizard was an old peasant, a\r\nwonderful man; he would whisper over water--but others say that he\r\nemitted serpents\xe2\x80\x99 venom on it--and give it to you to drink, and your\r\nmalady would instantly disappear. By the way, I thought, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get myself\r\nbled in Efr\xc3\xa9movo; \xe2\x80\x99tis a good remedy for terror; only, of course, not\r\nfrom the arm, but from the bleeding-vein.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut where is that place--the bleeding-vein?\xe2\x80\x9d--inquired Finopl\xc3\xa9ntoff,\r\nwith bashful curiosity.\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know? That spot on the fist close to the thumb, on which one\r\nshakes snuff from the horn.--Just here, see! \xe2\x80\x99Tis the very best place\r\nfor blood-letting; therefore, judge for yourselves; from the arm it will\r\nbe venal blood, while from this spot it is sparkling. The doctors don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that, and don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it; how should they, the sluggards, the\r\ndumb idiots? Blacksmiths chiefly make use of it. And what skilful\r\nfellows they are! They\xe2\x80\x99ll place their chisel on the spot, give it a\r\nwhack with their hammer--and the deed is done!... Well, sir, while I was\r\nmeditating in this wise, it had grown entirely dark out of doors, and it\r\nwas time to go to sleep. I lay down on my bed, and Tres\xc3\xb3r, of course,\r\nwas there also. But whether it was because of my fright or of the\r\nstifling heat, or because the fleas or my thoughts were bothersome, at\r\nany rate, I could not get to sleep. Such distress fell upon me as it is\r\nimpossible to describe; and I kept drinking water, and opening the\r\nwindow, and thrumming the \xe2\x80\x9cKam\xc3\xa1rynskaya\xe2\x80\x9d[46] on the guitar, with Italian\r\nvariations.... In vain! I felt impelled to leave the room,--and that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall there was to it. At last I made up my mind. I took a pillow, a\r\ncoverlet, and a sheet, and wended my way across the garden to the\r\nhay-barn; well, and there I settled myself. And there things were\r\nagreeable to me, gentlemen; the night was still, extremely still, only\r\nnow and then a breeze as soft as a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand would blow across my\r\ncheek, and it was very cool; the hay was fragrant as tea, the katydids\r\nwere rasping in the apple-trees; then suddenly a quail would emit its\r\ncall--and you would feel that he was taking his ease, the scamp, sitting\r\nin the dew with his mate.... And the sky was so magnificent; the stars\r\nwere twinkling, and sometimes a little cloud, as white as wadding, would\r\nfloat past, and even it would hardly stir....\r\n\r\nAt this point in the narrative, Skvor\xc3\xa9vitch sneezed; Kinar\xc3\xa9vitch, who\r\nnever lagged behind his comrade in anything, sneezed also. Ant\xc3\xb3n\r\nStep\xc3\xa1nitch cast a glance of approbation at both.\r\n\r\nWell, sir--[went on Porf\xc3\xadry Kap\xc3\xadtonitch],--so I lay there, and still I\r\ncould not get to sleep. A fit of meditation had seized upon me; and I\r\npondered chiefly over the great marvel, how that Prokh\xc3\xb3ritch had rightly\r\nexplained to me about the warning--and why such wonders should happen to\r\nme in particular.... I was astonished, in fact, because I could not\r\nunderstand it at all--while Tres\xc3\xb3rushko whimpered as she curled herself\r\nup on the hay; her wounds were paining her. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you another\r\nthing that kept me from sleeping--you will hardly believe it; the moon!\r\nIt stood right in front of me, so round and big and yellow and flat; and\r\nit seemed to me as though it were staring at me--by Heaven it did; and\r\nso arrogantly, importunately.... At last I stuck my tongue out at it, I\r\nreally did. Come, I thought, what art thou so curious about? I turned\r\naway from it; but it crawled into my ear, it illuminated the back of my\r\nhead, and flooded me as though with rain; I opened my eyes, and what did\r\nI see? It made every blade of grass, every wretched little blade in the\r\nhay, the most insignificant spider\xe2\x80\x99s web, stand out distinctly! \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\r\nlook, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. There was no help for it. I propped my head on my\r\nhand and began to stare at it. But I could not keep it up; if you will\r\nbelieve it, my eyes began to stick out like a hare\xe2\x80\x99s and to open very\r\nwide indeed, just as though they did not know what sleep was like. I\r\nthink I could have eaten up everything with those same eyes. The gate\r\nof the hay-barn stood wide open; I could see for a distance of five\r\nversts out on the plain; and distinctly, not in the usual way on a\r\nmoonlight night. So I gazed and gazed, and did not even wink.... And\r\nsuddenly it seemed to me as though something were waving about far, far\r\naway ... exactly as though things were glimmering indistinctly before my\r\neyes. Some time elapsed; again a shadow leaped across my vision,--a\r\nlittle nearer now; then again, still nearer. What is it? I thought. Can\r\nit be a hare? No, I thought, it is larger than a hare, and its gait is\r\nunlike that of a hare. I continued to look, and again the shadow showed\r\nitself, and it was moving now across the pasture-land (and the\r\npasture-land was whitish from the moonlight) like a very large spot; it\r\nwas plain that it was some sort of a wild beast--a fox or a wolf. My\r\nheart contracted within me ... but what was I afraid of, after all?\r\nAren\xe2\x80\x99t there plenty of wild animals running about the fields by night?\r\nBut my curiosity was stronger than my fears; I rose up, opened my eyes\r\nvery wide, and suddenly turned cold all over. I fairly froze rigid on\r\nthe spot, as though I had been buried in ice up to my ears; and why? The\r\nLord only knows! And I saw the shadow growing bigger and bigger, which\r\nmeant that it was making straight for the hay-barn.... And then it\r\nbecame apparent to me that it really was a large, big-headed wild\r\nbeast.... It dashed onward like a whirlwind, like a bullet.... Good\r\nheavens! What was it? Suddenly it stopped short, as though it scented\r\nsomething.... Why, it was the mad dog I had encountered that day! \xe2\x80\x99Twas\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x99twas he! O Lord! And I could not stir a finger, I could not\r\nshout.... It ran to the gate, glared about with its eyes, emitted a\r\nhowl, and dashed straight for me on the hay!\r\n\r\nBut out of the hay, like a lion, sprang my Tres\xc3\xb3r; and then the struggle\r\nbegan. The two clinched jaw to jaw, and rolled over the ground in a\r\nball! What took place further I do not remember; all I do remember is\r\nthat I flew head over heels across them, just as I was, into the garden,\r\ninto the house, and into my own bedroom!... I almost dived under the\r\nbed--there\xe2\x80\x99s no use in concealing the fact. And what leaps, what bounds\r\nI made in the garden! You would have taken me for the leading ballerina\r\nwho dances before the Emperor Napoleon on the day of his Angel--and even\r\nshe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have overtaken me. But when I had recovered myself a\r\nlittle, I immediately routed out the entire household; I ordered them\r\nall to arm themselves, and I myself took a sword and a revolver. (I must\r\nconfess that I had purchased that revolver after the Emancipation, in\r\ncase of need, you know--only I had hit upon such a beast of a pedlar\r\nthat out of three charges two inevitably missed fire.) Well, sir, I\r\ntook all this, and in this guise we sallied forth, in a regular horde,\r\nwith staves and lanterns, and directed our footsteps toward the\r\nhay-barn. We reached it and called--nothing was to be heard; we entered\r\nthe barn at last.... and what did we see? My poor Tres\xc3\xb3rushko lay dead,\r\nwith her throat slit, and that accursed beast had vanished without\r\nleaving a trace!\r\n\r\nThen, gentlemen, I began to bleat like a calf, and I will say it without\r\nshame; I fell down on the body of my twofold rescuer, so to speak, and\r\nkissed her head for a long time. And there I remained in that attitude\r\nuntil my old housekeeper, Prask\xc3\xb3vya, brought me to my senses (she also\r\nhad run out at the uproar).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you grieve so over the dog, Porf\xc3\xadry Step\xc3\xa1nitch?\xe2\x80\x9d--said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nwill surely catch cold, which God forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d (I was very lightly clad.)\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if that dog lost her life in saving you, she ought to reckon it as\r\na great favour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not agree with Prask\xc3\xb3vya, I went back to the house. And\r\nthe mad dog was shot on the following day by a soldier from the\r\ngarrison. And it must have been that that was the end appointed by Fate\r\nto the dog, for the soldier fired a gun for the first time in his life,\r\nalthough he had a medal for service in the year \xe2\x80\x9912. So that is the\r\nsupernatural occurrence which happened to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE narrator ceased speaking and began to fill his pipe. But we all\r\nexchanged glances of surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut perhaps you lead a very upright life,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Mr.\r\nFinopl\xc3\xa9ntoff,--\xe2\x80\x9cand so by way of reward....\xe2\x80\x9d But at that word he\r\nfaltered, for he saw that Porf\xc3\xadry Kap\xc3\xadtonitch\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks were beginning to\r\nswell out and turn red, and his eyes too were beginning to pucker\r\nup--evidently the man was on the point of breaking out....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut admitting the possibility of the supernatural, the possibility of\r\nits interference in everyday life, so to speak,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Ant\xc3\xb3n\r\nStep\xc3\xa1nitch:--\xe2\x80\x9cthen what r\xc3\xb4le, after this, must sound sense play?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNone of us found any answer, and, as before, we remained perplexed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The well-known poet Y\xc3\xa1koff Petr\xc3\xb3vitch Pol\xc3\xb3nsky is the authority for\r\nthis statement, in his \xe2\x80\x9cRecollections of Turg\xc3\xa9nieff,\xe2\x80\x9d printed in the\r\nearly numbers of the _Niva_ for 1884.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[2] The finest of the public parks in Moscow, situated near the famous\r\nSparrow Hills, is called \xe2\x80\x9cNesk\xc3\xbatchny\xe2\x80\x9d--\xe2\x80\x9cNot Tiresome,\xe2\x80\x9d generally\r\nrendered \xe2\x80\x9cSans Souci.\xe2\x80\x9d It contains an imperial residence, the Alexander\r\nPalace, used as an official summer home by the Governor-General of\r\nMoscow.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[3] Princes, princesses, counts, and countesses have the title of\r\n_Siy\xc3\xa1telstvo_ (_siy\xc3\xa1m_--to shine, to be radiant); generally translated\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIllustrious Highness\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cSerenity.\xe2\x80\x9d--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n[4] The custom still prevails in Russia, to a great extent, for all\r\nelderly women to wear caps.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
